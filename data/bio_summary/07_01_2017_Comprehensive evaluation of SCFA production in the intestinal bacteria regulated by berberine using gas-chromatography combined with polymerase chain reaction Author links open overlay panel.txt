Bottles were shaking at the speed of 50 rpm under the temperature of 37 - 1 degC which simulate the condition of intestinal bacteria ecosystem and then incubated over 2 h to enable the intestinal microbial community adapting to the nutritional and physicochemical conditionsBBR were dissolved in 2 mL cultured intestinal bacteria suspensiontaken from the incubation bottles to the dosed of 20 mg L and 50 mg L respectively saline solution was used as control.

The linearity of response for intestinal bacteria suspension were tested with the serial solutions prepared by diluting standard mixture solution with intestinal bacteria suspension followed by the treatment described in 2.3.Reliability study.

Sampleb represents intestinal bacterial suspension.the gene expression of three enzymes using RT-PCR.Effect of BBR on the SCFA synthetic enzymesNext we investigated whether BBR could modulate the gene expression of ACK MMD and BUT in intestinal bacteria.

The method seems to have good sensitivity and reliability in analyzing SCFAs in intestinal bacteria.Previous research evaluated the influence of orally taken materials on the intestinal bacteria by testing the SCFA in faces of animal or human .

Botanic compounds with low bioavailability such as berberine BBR and resveratrol might interact with intestinal microbial ecosystem and promote gut bacteria to produce SCFA which contribute to their biological effects.

In the present study a comprehensive assay system was built to detect SCFAs production in intestinal bacteria in which stringent anaerobic culture was applied for in vitro bacterial fermentation followed by direct-injection GC detection chemical detection in combination with real time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR biological detection.

As compared to the saline group the concentration of acetic acid propionate acid and butyric acid the main SCFAs in gut microbiota were increased by 17.7 11.1 and 30.5 respectively after incubating intestinal bacteria with 20 mgmL BBR for 24 h. The increase reached to 34.9 22.4 and 51.6 respectively when the BBR was 50 mgmL.

Although some previous experiments in vitro demonstrated that the SCFAs production could be adjusted by adding different nutrient contents such as chicory inulin bean flours Syrah grape and oat fiber and assumed that the intestinal bacteria as well as its fermentation ability would likely be modulated those assumptions were controversial because the nutrition components are often the starting materials for SCFAs synthesis whose interference couldn't be excluded .

The real regulatory effect and mechanisms of drugs on gut flora SCFAs production remain to be investigated.The aim of this study was to develop an accurate and efficient assay system to evaluate the modulation effect of drug candidates on SCFAs production in intestinal bacteria drugs with low oral bioavailability are of interest.
