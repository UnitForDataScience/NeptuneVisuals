In addition this first syn- thetic community study showed that four out of nine A. thaliana accessions tested harbored an altered community composition compared with the reference accession Col-0 underlining the great potential for the identification of novel plant factors affecting the microbiota .Synthetic community experiments have also been used to follow-up on observations made in microcosm experiments thereby linking the testing of hypotheses in a complex natural community to studies carried out under more controlled condi- tions allowing readouts at a lower taxonomic level.

Further by changing plant genotypes and using the same microbial community the func- tions of particular plant genes on the community can be deter- mined for exemplary illustrations of the vast potential experi- mental design options see .Synthetic community systems with a range of complexities can be designed within the constraints provided by available strain collections.

Ultimately however the effects of individual strains are testable by substituting strains belonging to the same OTU or ecotype finally demonstrating whether these strains behave similarly community outputs are robust and individual exemplars are interchangeable or not.Contrary to building synthetic communities based on phy- logeny the corresponding genome sequences together with gene-expression profiles can assist in designing a microbiota based on functional capabilities for example predicted meta- bolic ability or potential for the synthesis of natural products including signaling molecules or antibiotics that might potentially shape microbial community structures .

Furthermore it was shown that synthetic communities converged to a stable community that was robust against an imbalance in the initial inoculum highlighting reproducible assembly.Another recent study by focused on potential bacterial interactions and their role in community assembly on maize roots.

The chance to omit important commu- nity functions decreases as community complexity increases however even highly complex communities might miss crucial elements as mentioned before.Generally to be as natural as possible synthetic communities should mimic the corresponding culture-independent commu- nity profiles when taking the 16S18S rRNA gene as reference even if it remains difficult to translate OTUs to strains due to within OTU variability.

Experiments mixing synthetic communities with natural com- plex communities can be helpful to test how a simple community behaves in a complex environment.

Most importantly leaf-specific and root-specific syn- thetic communities of this core collection formed reproducible communities under controlled gnotobiotic conditions and these communities resembled the natural microbiota at the genus and phylum levels.

Thus structuring principles must exist that determine the architecture of various community configurations however these are presently insufficiently described.Understanding the mechanisms underlying the formationand function of host-associated microbial community structures is particularly relevant as the associated microbiota contrib- utes to the host's phenotype.

In addition the invasiveness of individual strains and pri- ority effects can also be tested by introducing them into a pre-es- tablished community thus providing insights into the historical contingency of community assembly.

Ultimately synthetic community experiments might provide new insights into the underlying causal relationships between microbiome genotype and plant phenotype by pinpointing community changes and individual gene functions that correlate with plant phenotype.
