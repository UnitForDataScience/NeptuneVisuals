To elucidate the role of oral bacteria in acute pediatric appendicitis we studied the oral and appendiceal microbiome of affected children compared to healthy controls.Methods Between January and June 2015 21 children undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis and 28 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled in the study.

Total bacterial DNA from gingival sul- cus of both groups SulcApp  appendicitis sulcus SulcCon  control sulcus and the appendix App  appendix in acute appendicitis was extracted according to the following proto- col  After unfreezing swabspaper points they were treat- ed with 360 ml lysozyme solution for 30 min at 37 degC 20 mg ml lysozyme 20 mM TrisHCl 2 mM EDTA 1.2 Triton X100 pH 8.00.

Bacterial abundance at phylum level of inflamed appendices App differed to the gingival sulcus of children with acute appendicitis SulcApp but not to the gingival sulcus of healthy controls SulcCon.

The mRNA expression of bacteria normalized to 23S rRNA inphlegmonous appendices App and gingival sulcus in children with acute appendicitis SulcApp compared to gingival sulcus of healthy controls SulcCon.

The lack of detection in our study can be well explained as samples were taken from the gingival sulcus of children without acute oral infections overall PSI  1.7 - 0.9.P.

Thus appendectomy remains the only definitive treatment of acute appendicitis.To the best of our knowledge this is the first study investi- gating the relationship between the oral and the appendiceal microbiome in children with acute appendicitis and healthy controls.

Finally two culture-independent ap- proaches revealed not only the presence of bacterial DNA sequencing but also their viability levels RT-qPCR addi- tionally we were able to verify a proof of principle that the GI passage can be a potential route of infection.ConclusionWe identified several oral pathogens such as P. stomatiscorrodens and F. nucleatum by 16S rDNA sequencing in acute pediatric appendicitis in both gingival sulcus and appen- dices.

Moreover in the large number of detected bacteria oral microbes such asFusobacterium Porphyromonas Peptostreptococcus and Gemella were significantly increased in acute appendicitis    -.Recent data suggest that the oral cavity serves as a reservoir for pathogens causing systemic inflammatory processes   .
