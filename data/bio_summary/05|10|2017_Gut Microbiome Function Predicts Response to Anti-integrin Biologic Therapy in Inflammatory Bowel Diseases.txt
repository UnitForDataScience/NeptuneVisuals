Persistency of treatment effect was observable at both week 30 and week 54 for both the remission and non-remission groups though only the changes in the remission group demonstrated a statistical differ- ence compared to random sampling D. Specifically patients achieving remission at week 14 demonstrated highlysignificant persistency in the microbial composition at week 30 p  0.00039 and a weaker effect at week 54 p  0.019 sug- gesting that attainment of remission at week 14 is associated with durable changes in the microbiome.Neural Network Algorithms vedoNet to Predict Treatment ResponseSeveral different neural network models were evaluated to predict clinical remission at week 14 A and 4B see for model details.

Longitudinal Changes in Taxa and Pathways between Remission and Non- remission GroupsA and B Log2-fold change log2FC in CD A and UC B patients' microbiome pathways that repre- sented significant change at week 14 follow-up in comparison with baseline samples divided into remission and non-remission groups FDR  0.1.Log2FC of species that represented significant change at week 14 follow-up in comparison with baseline sample left panel CD right panel UC divided into remission and non-remission groups FDR  0.1.The persistency index P for subjects with a laterfollow-up wk30 or wk54 available.

Formally the index P was defined asPBCDf b-BCDf kBCDk bwhere BCDx y represents the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between sample x and y and b k and f defined the baseline week 14 and later follow-up week 30 or week 54 samples.

In UC while no significant differen- tial changes in taxa were noted palmitate and stearate biosyn- thesis pathways increased in relative abundance in patients achieving remission and decreased in those not achieving remis- sion q  0.087 and 0.045 respectively Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted c2 test.Persistence of Changes in the Microbiome at 1 Year Eight patients 3 CD 5 UC provided stool samples at baseline weeks 14 30 and 54 while 13 patients 5 CD 8 UC had samples available at baseline weeks 14 and 54.

Community a-diversity was significantly higher and Roseburia inulinivorans and a Burkholderiales species were more abundant at baseline among CD patients achieving week 14 remission.

Patients who attained remission were likely to have had disease for a shorter duration more likely to have a diag- nosis of CD and less likely to have had prior anti-TNF exposure p  0.05 for all Table S1.Baseline Metagenomic Composition and Remission at Week 14Community alpha-diversity at baseline was significantly higher in CD patients who achieved remission at week 14 q  0.1 Stu- dent's t test A.

However two species demonstrated a statistically significant difference in relative abundance at baseline between week 14 remitters and non-remitters.

Both Roseburia inulinivorans and a Burkholder- iales species were significantly more abundant at baseline among CD patients achieving week 14 remission compared to non-remitters q  0.0914 for R. inulinivorans q  0.0614 for Burkholderiales sp.

We found that among CD baseline samples those who entered remission at week 14 possessed a cluster of unique SNPs FDR  0.1 located in L-arginine biosynthesis pathways.
