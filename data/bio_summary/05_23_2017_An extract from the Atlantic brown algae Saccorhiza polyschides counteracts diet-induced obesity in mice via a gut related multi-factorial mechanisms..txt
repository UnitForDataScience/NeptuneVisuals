The plasma profile of bile acids Supplementary Figure 1 reveals that all bile acids including cholic acid CA muricholic acid MCA and chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA as well as their derivatives the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid DCA hyodeoxycholic acid HDCA lithocholic acid LCA and ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA were increased upon BAE supplementation.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated with a subsequent log-rank test to compare survival curves of the two groups.AbbreviationsBAE brown algae extract BAT brown adipose tissue BSH bile salt hydrolase CA cholic acid CDCA chenodeoxycholic acid Cr creatinine DCA deoxycholic acid EE energy expenditure HDCA hyodeoxycholic acid HFD high fat diet LCA lithocholic acid MCA muricholic acid micro-CT micro-computed tomography NMR nuclear magnetic resonance RER respiratory exchange ratio SCFA short chain fatty acids UDCA ursodeoxycholic acid WAT white adipose tissueAuthor contributionsP.H.

Collectively results indicate that BAE alters drastically bile acid homeostasis by enhancing enterohepatic circulation via modification of microbial metabolism and enhancement of intestinal absorption of total bile acids but in particular of primary bile acids conjugated with taurine Figure 2F without affecting total bile acid excretion in feces.The expression of the majority of genes involved in post-absorptive bile acid metabolism are not affected by BAE supplementationWe examined mRNA levels of genes involved in bile acid uptake and binding export synthesis and excretion in the ileum liver and kidney after 4 and 12 h of fasting Table 2.

We observed apparent metabolic improvement including normalization of blood glucose reduced plasma leptin reduced fecal bile salt hydrolase activity with lower microbial production of toxic bile acid metabolites in the gut and increased systemic bile acid circulation in BAE-fed mice counteracting adverse effects of long term HFD feeding.

In plasma the ratio of conjugated to unconjugated bile acids was significantly modified with a relative decrease of unconjugated bile acids and an increase of glycine and taurine conjugation in the BAE group F. G. Furthermore the ratio of cholic acid CA to muricholic MCA and chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA tended to be higher whereas the secondary-to-primary bile acid-ratio was not different in BAE miceG.

Furthermore the mRNA levels of Cyp7a1 which is the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis were similar between groups whereas Cyp8b1 synthesis of cholic acid depicted an upward trend under BAE supplementation p  0.088.

These results agree with the increased renal excretion of the circulating bile acids in BAE mice.BAE modulates substrate oxidation and intestinal expression of genes related to bile acid glucose and fatty acid metabolismDietary BAE had no effect on energy expenditure Supplementary Figure 3 whereas the respiratory exchange ratio was significantly increased compared to the control group Figure 3A indicating augmented glucose oxidation especially during the light phase when the mice were naturally resting.

In view of the BAE-induced changes in bile acid homeostasis we measured the mRNA level of the bile acid activated transcription factor FXR and observed a time dependent modulation Figure 3E.

Fecal bile acid hydrolase BSH activity is a measure of the intestinal capacity for bile acid deconjugation and was determined as previously described 48 with minor modifications.

We moreover propose a multi-factorial mechanism that involves profound alterations in bile acid homeostasis changes in intestinal and systemic glucose metabolism likely including increased intestinal gluconeogenesis increased activity of the intestinally derived hormone GLP-1 contributing to promote systemic insulin sensitivity and inhibition of a-amylase activity which expectably limits dietary carbohydrate digestion and glucose release.INTRODUCTIONThe World Health Organization states that in the past 30 years the worldwide obesity rates have nearly doubled reaching a critical number of 1.4 billion people in 2008 emphasizing a serious health problem.
