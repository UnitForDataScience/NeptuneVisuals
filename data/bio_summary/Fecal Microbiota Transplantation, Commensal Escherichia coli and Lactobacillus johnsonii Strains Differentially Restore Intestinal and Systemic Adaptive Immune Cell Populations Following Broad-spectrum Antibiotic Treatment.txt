In conclusion our data provide novel insights into the distinct role of individual commensal bacteria in maintaining immune functions duringfollowing dysbiosis induced by antibiotic therapy thereby shaping host immunity and might thus open novel therapeutical avenues in conditions of perturbed microbiota composition.Keywords commensal intestinal microbiota Escherichia coli Lactobacillus johnsonii fecal microbiota transplantation secondary abiotic gnotobiotic mice intestinal mucosal and peripheral and central immunity immune-modulating effects immune restorationINTRODUCTIONApproximately 1013 microorganisms collectively known as microbiota reside in the human gastrointestinal tract    and have increasingly received well-deserved attention regarding their deep impact on the physiology and well-being of the mammalian host.

johnsonii FMT led to any adverse clinical effects in mice such as wasting diarrhea occurrence of blood in feces or microscopic signs of intestinal inflammation including epithelial apoptosis data not shown.T Cell Populations in Murine Intestinal and Systemic Compartments Following FMT or Recolonization of Secondary Abiotic Mice with E. coli or L. johnsoniiTo examine the impact of E. coli and L. johnsonii versus complex gut microbiota on distinct immune cell populations after antibiotic microbiota depletion we isolated lymphocytes from small and large intestinal LP MLN and spleen and analyzed defined immune cell populations by flow cytometry on d7 and d28 post recolonization.

Splenic CD86 cells displayed the highest abundance at d7 post FMT but could also be restored to basal naive levels by either E. coli or L. johnsonii recolonization alone p  0.001 vs. ABx .Taken together our data indicate that depending on the respective immunological compartment and immune cell subset single bacterial commensal species may be as effective as complex microbiota in reversing antibiotics induced collateral damages on intestinal mucosal and systemic immunity.Production of Pro- andAnti-inflammatory Cytokines by CD4 Cells in Murine Intestinal and Systemic Compartments Following FMT or Recolonization of Secondary Abiotic Mice with E. coli or L. johnsoniiWe further addressed the impact of E. coli and L. johnsonii recolonization on the cytokine production pattern of CD4 lymphocytes in intestinal mucosal peripheral and systemic immunological sites and therefore determined the frequencies of TNF  IFN-g  IL-17  IL-22  and IL-10  producing CD4 lymphocytes in the small and large intestines MLN and spleens of recolonized mice.The antibiotics-induced decreases of TNF producing CD4 cells in the small and large intestines were accompanied by increased abundances in the MLN and spleen p  0.01-0.001 ABx vs. N .

johnsonii or with a complex murine microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation FMT.

For instance a reduction of the IL-17 producing Th17 cell compartment playing a pivotal role in protection against bacterial and fungal pathogens   may explain the increased susceptibility of microbiota depleted mice to pathogens    .In the present study we investigated the role of two important representatives of Gram-negative namely E. coli and Gram-positive namely L. johnsonii commensals both derived from the gut microbiota of healthy mice in restoring numbers of distinct immune cell subsets following antibiotic treatment as compared to FMT in C57Bl6j ABx mice.

coli and L. johnsonii respectively versus the complex gut microbiota in shaping host immunity following antibiotics- induced microbiota depletion.

However it is highly likely that L. johnsonii and other probiotic species exert additional beneficial functions throughIL-10 independent mechanisms given their capability to attenuate the severity of colonic inflammation in IL-10 deficient mice.The reintroduction of complex microbiota into the host via FMT is a well-known therapy dating back to the Chinese Dong-jin dynasty in the fourth century   and has undergone a renaissance recently as a therapeutic option for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile toxin induced acute necrotizing pseudo-membranous enterocolitis          .In summary the restoration of immune cell populations following broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment by commensal bacterial mono-colonization appears to be less effective than by complex intestinal microbiota association upon FMT but depends both on the respective immune cell subtypes and analyzed compartments and does hence not follow a clear cut pattern.

However both E. coli and L. johnsonii induced a significant increase of CD25 expression in lymphocytes derived from the small intestine colon and spleen as early as d7 post recolonization p  0.05-0.001 vs. ABx  whereas notably L. johnsonii exerted a more pronounced effect than E. coli in the colon at d7 p  0.05-0.001 vs. Ec .

Aim of this study was to examine the ability of defined Gram-positive and Gram-negative intestinal commensal bacterial species namely Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus johnsonii respectively to restore immune functions in mice that were immunosuppressed by antibiotics-induced microbiota depletion.

johnsoniiIn the present study we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative Gram-negative or Gram-positive intestinal bacterial species namely E. coli and L. johnsonii respectively in comparison to a complex gut microbiota in mice that had been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic compounds.
