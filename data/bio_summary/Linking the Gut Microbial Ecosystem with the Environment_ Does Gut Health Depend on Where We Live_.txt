This population of microorganisms and their genetic potential or the gut microbiome has been linked to human metabolism intestinal homeostasis immune development Lynch and Pedersen 2016 and brain processes and behavior Mayer et al.

Other functions of the gut microbiota include fermentation of indigestible dietarycomponents Flint et al.

2012 breakdown of environmental pollutants and pharmaceuticals Claus et al.

2017 and pathogen competitive exclusion Kamada et al.

Alterations to the gut microbiota known as dysbiosis can disrupt these essential health-promoting services and are associated with gastrointestinal cardiovascular autoimmune and metabolic diseases Carding et al.

The gut microbiota is a diverse ecosystem comprised of bacteria archaea fungi and viruses including a diverse bacteriophage community Manrique et al.

Bacteria dominate the microbiota in abundance and diversity with commensal members from seven phyla Firmicutes Bacteriodetes Actinobacteria Fusobacteria Proteobacteria Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria the majority of which are uncultivated and novel phylotypes Eckburg et al.

Members of the microbiota can be permanent residents transmitted through close contact between individuals or transient hitchhikers from ingested food water and various components of the environment Ley et al.

These transmission routes are important for establishing and maintaining microbial diversity in the gut Browne et al.

Colonizing gut microbes provide signals known as microbe-associated molecular patterns MAMPs that affect the maturation of the immune system and gut associated lymphoid tissue GALT Wopereis et al.
