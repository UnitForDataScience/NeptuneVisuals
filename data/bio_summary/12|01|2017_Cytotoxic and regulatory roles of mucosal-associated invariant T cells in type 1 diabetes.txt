the localization and func- tion of mait cells highlight their key role in the maintenance of gut integrity whereby they control the development of autoimmune responses to pancreatic b-cells.resultsalterations in mait cells in children with recent-onset t1d we first began our investigation of mait cells in t1d by analyz- ing the frequency and phenotype of mait cells in fresh peripheral1inserm u1016 institut cochin paris france and universite paris descartes paris france.

analysis of the phenotype of mait cells showed a lower frequency of mait cells expressing tissue-recruit- ment andor adhesion molecules ccr6 and cd56 at the onset of the disease relative to the frequency of such cells later in disease as well as a higher frequency of mait cells expressing the activation andor exhaustion markers cd25 and pd-1 and a lower frequency of mait cells expressing the anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2 .

in children with recent-onset t1d the frequency of mait cells expressing the migra- tory molecule ccr6 or the anti-apoptotic molecules bcl-2 was posi- tively correlated with the overall frequency of mait cells whereas the expression of cd25 by mait cell was negatively correlated with the overall frequency of mait cells supplementary fig.

together these results highlighted functional altera- tion of mait cells in children with recent-onset t1d.cytotoxic effect of mait cells on human b-cellswe next investigated potential links between the phenotype of and functional alterations to mait cells and the clinical characteristics ofchildren with recent-onset t1d supplementary tables 1 and 2. the frequency of gzb mait cells was negatively associated with the age of the children at diagnosis  in agreement with the current view that t1d is more aggressive in the youngest children.

mait cells from children with recent-onset t1d pro- duced less ifn-g than did mait cells from control children whereas their production of tnf il-4 and gzb was higher than that of mait cells from control children .

among those effector mol- ecules only the frequency of gzb-producing mait cells correlated with the overall frequency of mait cells greater gzb production was observed in patients with a lower frequency of mait cells data not shown.

multi-parameter analysis of the production of cytokines and gzb by mait cells also showed that blood mait cells from children with established t1d had an intermediate status between that of such cells from control children and such cells from children with recent- onset t1d  as already observed for the surface phenotype of mait cells .

indeed a more-aggressive disease associated with sustained abnor- malities in mait cells would suggest a shorter time of hyperglycemia before the onset and thus lower concentrations of hba1c.the strong inverse correlation between the production of gzb by mait cells and the age of the children at the time of disease onset sug- gested that mait cells might participate in b-cell death.

although the frequency of mait cells among t cells after 1 year of insulin treatment remained at a level similar to that before insulin treatment began the frequency of both ccr6 mait cells and bcl- 2 mait cells was significantly higher after 1 year of insulin treatment than before insulin treatment began .

in contrast the recruit- ment of mait cells into the ileum decreased with aging  in support of the finding of a decreased frequency of mait cells in this tissue in diabetic nod mice.to further explore the function of mait cells in t1d we analyzed their cytokine production in various tissues at the three stages of diseaseamait cells6 weeks16 weeksdiabetic365740fsc-amfi  7817mfi  16359mfi  7545rorgt-gfp 6 weeks16 weeksdiabetic2500020000150001000050000   6 weeks 16 weeks diabeticbcd 5-op-ru fecal supernatant0.010.001  30002000  0.10.1no ac-6-fp ac-6-fpno ac-6-fp ac-6-fp 0.00010.000011000010 weeks diabetic10 weeks diabeticcd691.2e1001010.1no ac-6-fp ac-6-fpfno ac-6-fpg4 ac-6-fp83624120.010.01 0.1110 100 10005-op-ru nmoll0014121fecal supernatant dilution010-13weeks16-22weeksdiabeticfigure 7 alterations to the gut mucosa during t1d progression in nod mice.

overall these data lead us to propose that mait cells are at the crossroads of the gut mucosa inflammation and t1d.interestingly alterations in mait cells in both patients and mice have been detected before the onset of diabetes which indicates that mait cell might represent a new biomarker for the development of t1d.

1 d later where indicated cytokines tnf 1100 uml il-1b 1000 uml ifn-g 2000 uml were added to endoc-bh1 cell cultures for 24 h. in parallel mait cells from donors were purified by negative isolation with dynabeads goat anti-mouse igg invitrogen then were stained with the appropriate antibodies identified above and sorted by facsaria purity was 99. after sorting mait cells were cultured in complete medium contain- ing rpmi supplemented with 10 fcs 1 penicillin-streptomycin and 1 hepes and supplemented with 25 ngml recombinant human il-7 rd systems for 48 h. then mait cells were added to endoc-bh1 cell cultures at 11 ratio and were cultured 24 h in presence of various concentrations of 5- op-ru.

here we found alterations in mait cells in patients with t1d and through the use of nod mice revealed a protective role for mait cells directed against t1d.
