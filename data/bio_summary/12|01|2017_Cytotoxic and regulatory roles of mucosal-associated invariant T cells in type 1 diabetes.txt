The localization and func- tion of MAIT cells highlight their key role in the maintenance of gut integrity whereby they control the development of autoimmune responses to pancreatic b-cells.RESULTSAlterations in MAIT cells in children with recent-onset T1D We first began our investigation of MAIT cells in T1D by analyz- ing the frequency and phenotype of MAIT cells in fresh peripheral1INSERM U1016 Institut Cochin Paris France and Universite Paris Descartes Paris France.

Analysis of the phenotype of MAIT cells showed a lower frequency of MAIT cells expressing tissue-recruit- ment andor adhesion molecules CCR6 and CD56 at the onset of the disease relative to the frequency of such cells later in disease as well as a higher frequency of MAIT cells expressing the activation andor exhaustion markers CD25 and PD-1 and a lower frequency of MAIT cells expressing the anti-apoptotic molecule BCL-2 .

In children with recent-onset T1D the frequency of MAIT cells expressing the migra- tory molecule CCR6 or the anti-apoptotic molecules BCL-2 was posi- tively correlated with the overall frequency of MAIT cells whereas the expression of CD25 by MAIT cell was negatively correlated with the overall frequency of MAIT cells Supplementary Fig.

MAIT cells from children with recent-onset T1D pro- duced less IFN-g than did MAIT cells from control children whereas their production of TNF IL-4 and GzB was higher than that of MAIT cells from control children .

Among those effector mol- ecules only the frequency of GzB-producing MAIT cells correlated with the overall frequency of MAIT cells greater GzB production was observed in patients with a lower frequency of MAIT cells data not shown.

Multi-parameter analysis of the production of cytokines and GzB by MAIT cells also showed that blood MAIT cells from children with established T1D had an intermediate status between that of such cells from control children and such cells from children with recent- onset T1D  as already observed for the surface phenotype of MAIT cells .

Together these results highlighted functional altera- tion of MAIT cells in children with recent-onset T1D.Cytotoxic effect of MAIT cells on human b-cellsWe next investigated potential links between the phenotype of and functional alterations to MAIT cells and the clinical characteristics ofchildren with recent-onset T1D Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Indeed a more-aggressive disease associated with sustained abnor- malities in MAIT cells would suggest a shorter time of hyperglycemia before the onset and thus lower concentrations of HbA1c.The strong inverse correlation between the production of GzB by MAIT cells and the age of the children at the time of disease onset sug- gested that MAIT cells might participate in b-cell death.

Although the frequency of MAIT cells among T cells after 1 year of insulin treatment remained at a level similar to that before insulin treatment began the frequency of both CCR6 MAIT cells and BCL- 2 MAIT cells was significantly higher after 1 year of insulin treatment than before insulin treatment began .
