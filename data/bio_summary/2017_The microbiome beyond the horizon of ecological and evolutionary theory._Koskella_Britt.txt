Here we highlight potential pitfalls in the application of existing theoretical tools without careful consideration of the unique complexities of the microbiome focusing particularly on the issue of human health and anchoring our discussion in existing empirical evidence.running theme across biological fields is the importance of interactions among species whether it be human health in the face of pathogens the disturbance of delicate ecosystemsby invasive species or the shaping of carbon cycles via microbial communities it is clear that the biology of an individual species cannot be understood in isolation.

One path to coexistence is com- munity-wide character displacement whereby locally coexisting species are less functionally similar to each other than species drawn randomly from a larger regional pool because species with overlapping niches reflected by overlapping characters have been locally competitively excluded.

The dynamics of species diversity are defined by the probabilities of species loss extinction emigration and gain immigration speciation and are independent from species identity.Niche overlap.

The characteristics of the niche and niche overlap will shape the degree to which earlier-arriving species can exclude species that share requirements for that resource niche-pre-emption and the degree to which species can modify the niches of others niche modification.Priority effect.

For example the shifting infant microbiome has been associated with the presence of species that reduce the oxygen gradient altering the potential of establishment by other species and during succession following tooth-cleaning in dental plaques the presence of species that create structural supports are necessary to allow colonization of others.

Examining macroevolutionary patterns by comparing microbiomes across related species to identify co-divergence and co-speciation of hosts and particular microbiota lineages.What shapes stability and resilience of the microbiome Development of keystone or hub species approachthrough network analyses to delineate those species with the greatest effects on the rest of the community.

Identification of tipping pointsvia characterization of species with bistable patterns of abundance for example to shed light on the degree to which alternative stable states of communities rather than a continuum are to be expected.How does microbial species diversity relate to microbiome function health Measuring functional redundancy niche overlap to char- acterize the degree to which species coexistence depends onniche separation and how compositional change influences functional diversity.

While this pattern accords with island biogeography theory where colonization is key and de novo mutation plays a relatively minor role in shaping diversity local adaptation might still be an important driver of diversity if taxonomic diversity only weaklyPhasevariation Cross-feeding clonal interferenceproduction of toxins Host control ofreflects functional diversity such that focusing only on taxonomic diversity might miss in situ adaptation.The rapid turnover of genes andor species within microbiomesalso complicates the question of how we tackle the classic questionRapid evolutionvolatiles public goodsmicrobiome host geneticsof species' coexistence mechanisms.

b The ecological and evolutionary theories and approaches that have or could be used to shed insight on these observations are shown ranging from the virulence transmission trade-off from disease ecology species that grow to higher within-host densities mayhave higher transmission probabilities to the notion of environmental filtering species can only colonize areas that meet required environmental conditions and metapopulation theory the variety of theories that tackle drivers of community stability local adaptation and so on see the main text and glossary in Box  to theories tackling emergent properties of the host-microbiome coevolution for example the Black Queen hypothesis.
