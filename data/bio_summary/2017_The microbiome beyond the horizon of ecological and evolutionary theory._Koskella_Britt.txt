here we highlight potential pitfalls in the application of existing theoretical tools without careful consideration of the unique complexities of the microbiome focusing particularly on the issue of human health and anchoring our discussion in existing empirical evidence.running theme across biological fields is the importance of interactions among species whether it be human health in the face of pathogens the disturbance of delicate ecosystemsby invasive species or the shaping of carbon cycles via microbial communities it is clear that the biology of an individual species cannot be understood in isolation.

one path to coexistence is com- munity-wide character displacement whereby locally coexisting species are less functionally similar to each other than species drawn randomly from a larger regional pool because species with overlapping niches reflected by overlapping characters have been locally competitively excluded.

the dynamics of species diversity are defined by the probabilities of species loss extinction emigration and gain immigration speciation and are independent from species identity.niche overlap.

the characteristics of the niche and niche overlap will shape the degree to which earlier-arriving species can exclude species that share requirements for that resource niche-pre-emption and the degree to which species can modify the niches of others niche modification.priority effect.

for example the shifting infant microbiome has been associated with the presence of species that reduce the oxygen gradient altering the potential of establishment by other species and during succession following tooth-cleaning in dental plaques the presence of species that create structural supports are necessary to allow colonization of others.

b the ecological and evolutionary theories and approaches that have or could be used to shed insight on these observations are shown ranging from the virulence transmission trade-off from disease ecology species that grow to higher within-host densities mayhave higher transmission probabilities to the notion of environmental filtering species can only colonize areas that meet required environmental conditions and metapopulation theory the variety of theories that tackle drivers of community stability local adaptation and so on see the main text and glossary in box  to theories tackling emergent properties of the host-microbiome coevolution for example the black queen hypothesis.

furthermore even if the species composition of the commu- nity is not swiftly changing evidence from the human microbi- ome suggests that transcriptional downregulation of certain genes in the presence of another species might alter competition and allow for niche segregation at the transcriptional level.

the success of a particular species or strain depends on its frequency relative to other species or strains.historical contingency.

together these data suggest that deterministic processes that is mechanisms with predictable outcomes such as competitive interactions with a clear dominant species or mutualistic ones with a positive impact on both species growth are important in shaping microbiome assem- bly and composition but the nuance of how these processes oper- ate in the face of shifting timescales and whenwhy the neutral theory can be appropriately applied in many cases are important questions for further work.beyond adaptation to competitors adaptations involved in inter- actions with predatorsand parasitic phagesare also likely to be important in colonization of and success within the microbiome.

in contrast to the typical role of parasites in the community ecology of eukaryotes phages of the microbiota can rapidly recombine to achieve altered host ranges seem more likely to be shared across diverse species given the commonality of many cell surface receptors and shared resistance mechanisms and may move between being beneficial prophage and antagonistic lytic phage as revealed by data on the interactions between salivary phages and the oral microbiome.a final challenge to embedding microbiome systems within relevant timescales to generate theoretical predictions is that many microbiome species also considerably alter their environment.
