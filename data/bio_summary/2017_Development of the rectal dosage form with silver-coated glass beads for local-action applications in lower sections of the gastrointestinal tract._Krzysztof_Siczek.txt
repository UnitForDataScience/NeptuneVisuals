The accuracy of analyses was at 0.1.Preparation of suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads Rectal suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads were pre- pared by melting the suppository base at 40 oC dispersing coatedTable 1.

Average mass of obtained suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads was 2.08 - 0.04 g n 6.All prepared suppositories had a glossy smooth surface with- out cracks or air bubbles.Evaluation of prepared suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads using X-ray CT measurementThe X-ray CT using Carl Zeiss Metrotom 1500 scanner Carl ZeissIMT Oberkoche Germany equipped with a 225 kV micro-focus tube 20482 pixels flat panel detector 16 bit grayscale rotary table and maximal current 1000 lA was used.

The obtained data were analyzed using VG Studio MAX software Volume Graphics GmbH Heidelberg Germany.ResultsAnalysis of the erosion of the silver layer in the silver-coated glass beadsMicrophotographs of the silver layer coating on the glass beads clearly show its erosion upon incubation with the dissolution medium .

For silicon the values were 13.4 38.1 and 32.7 respectively.Of note calcium levels remained stable throughout the erosion analysis.Evaluation of prepared suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads by X-ray CT measurement shows vertical X-ray CT slice images of suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads obtained by methodsmiddle parts .

.The aim of the study was to validate the possibility of effective silver release from silver-coated glass beads for anti-inflammatory local application in the lower sections of the GI tract.

Here we attempted to develop a suppository formulation prepared on the base of cocoa butter containing silver-coated glass beads and then evaluated its quality using X-ray computed tomography.

.Materials and methodsMaterialsSilver-coated glass beads were prepared using magnetron method as described previously Siczec et al.
