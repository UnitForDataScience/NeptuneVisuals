average mass of obtained suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads was 2.08 - 0.04 g n 6.all prepared suppositories had a glossy smooth surface with- out cracks or air bubbles.evaluation of prepared suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads using x-ray ct measurementthe x-ray ct using carl zeiss metrotom 1500 scanner carl zeissimt oberkoche germany equipped with a 225 kv micro-focus tube 20482 pixels flat panel detector 16 bit grayscale rotary table and maximal current 1000 la was used.

the obtained data were analyzed using vg studio max software volume graphics gmbh heidelberg germany.resultsanalysis of the erosion of the silver layer in the silver-coated glass beadsmicrophotographs of the silver layer coating on the glass beads clearly show its erosion upon incubation with the dissolution medium .

for silicon the values were 13.4 38.1 and 32.7 respectively.of note calcium levels remained stable throughout the erosion analysis.evaluation of prepared suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads by x-ray ct measurement shows vertical x-ray ct slice images of suppositories containing silver-coated glass beads obtained by methodsmiddle parts .

.the aim of the study was to validate the possibility of effective silver release from silver-coated glass beads for anti-inflammatory local application in the lower sections of the gi tract.

here we attempted to develop a suppository formulation prepared on the base of cocoa butter containing silver-coated glass beads and then evaluated its quality using x-ray computed tomography.

.materials and methodsmaterialssilver-coated glass beads were prepared using magnetron method as described previously siczec et al.

briefly borosilicate glass beads with the diameter of 1000 mm were placed in a special holder in the magnetron sputtering unit.

the actual weight of glass beads per each deposition was set to about 0.5 g. after reaching the base pressure of 5 10-3 pa in the vacuum chamber pure argon 5 n was compressed to the working pressure of 0.7 pa. deposition of silver layer lasted 360 s with the sputtering power of 270 w siczec et al.

all other reagents of analytical-reagent grade were purchased from sigma-aldrich st. louis mo.methodsin vitro silver release study - the indirect methodrelease of silver from the silver-coated glass bead surface was car- ried in bio-dis reciprocating cylinder apparatus usp apparatus 3 agilent palo alto ca employing an agitation of 10 dips per minute and 250 ml of 0.1 moll phosphate buffer solution ph 6.8 at 37 oc.

fifteen randomly selected silver-coated glass beads were placed in a dipping tube with a polypropylene top and bottom screens of 420-mm mesh size.

the xr microanalysis and the chemical composition analysis evidenced for an expected rapid within 30 min release of nearly 50 of silver from the coating ag wt77.1 vs. 34.9 at time 0 and 45 min respectively stable up to 24 h of incubation .there was a noticeable increase in the contents of sodium and silicon which seemed inversely proportional to the silver contents in the glass bead coating.
