Alternatively if expression differences are plastic responses to habitat transitions common garden experiments would reveal sim- ilar expression patterns for marine and freshwater species under the same conditions.We study Odontesthes silversides that comprise 19 marine and freshwater species commonly known as pejerreyes Dyer 2006 which have recently and frequently transitioned from marine to freshwater in southern South America Bloom Weir Piller  Lovejoy 2013 Campanella et al.

bonariensis Figure 4.4  DISCUSSION  Divergence between marine and freshwater fishesThe genetic data mitochondrial DNA and few nuclear gene se- quences available to compare O. argentinensis and O. bonariensis prior to our transcriptome analysis suggested very little genetic di- vergence within the typical boundaries of intraspecific variation Diaz et al.

bonariensis.Whether due to rapid speciation in freshwater habitats or ongo- ing gene flow among incipient freshwater species and marine fishes there is little genetic differentiation among species in the argentinen- sis-bonariensis species complex Campanella et al.

We focus on a pair of species one marine and one freshwater O. bonariensis native to lakes and rivers of the Pampas region of Argentina the Rio de la Plata and Lower Parana and Uruguay basins up to the Tramandai coastal lagoon system in Brazil Dyer 2006 Liotta 2005 Somoza et al.

Most fishes are stenohaline have narrow salinity tolerance and just 2 of all fishes are euryhaline occupying both marine and freshwater envi- ronments Betancur-R et al.

For example significant divergence of SNPs associated with freshwater adaptation has been detected in or near genes related to osmoregu- lation stress and immune function by comparing marine and fresh- water populations of sticklebacks and killifishes Hohenlohe et al.
