in one of our previous studies we were able to report that l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequent species in the vagina of pregnant women followed by l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus 19. moreover we successfully tested probiotic capsules containing these species and reported an improvement in the vaginal lactobacillus micro- biota after oral administration in male-to-female transsexual women 20.in the present study we were able to demonstrate that the geni- tourinary syndrome of menopause and symptomatic vaginal atro- phy are common findings among women with bc undergoing chemotherapy.

consecutive vaginal swabs were taken at base- line 1 day after administration of the last capsule follow- up 1 and after 1 week follow-up 2 in 22 patients 11 vs. 11. results we observed a positive influence on the vaginal microbiota in 711 63 women in the interven- tion group and 411 36 women in the control group.

the syndrome leads to symptomatic vaginal atrophy in both pre- and postmenopausal women accompanied by cytological changes in the vaginal smear 5-7. vaginal estrogen therapy reduces escherichia coli coloniza- tion and increases the number of lactobacilli resulting in a signifi- cant decrease in recurrent urinary tract infections 8. however estrogen treatment for genitourinary syndrome in women with bc is performed with restraint since this tumor entity is often hor- mone-sensitive 6 9. hence the use of lactobacilli could be a safe and effective treatment option for the prevention of bacterial dys- biosis and recurrent urinary tract infections in bc patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause.fax 49 761 4 52 07 14 c2017 the authors.published by s. karger gmbh freiburgthis article is licensed under the creative commons attribution- noncommercial-noderivatives 4.0 international license cc by-nc- nd 4.0 tusage and distribution for commercial purposes as well as any distribution of modified material requires written permission.ljubomir petricevic m.d.division of obstetrics and fetomaternal medicinedepartment of obstetrics and gynecology medical university vienna waehringer guertel 18-20 1090 vienna austria although lactobacillus spp.

in premenopausal women estrogen encourages the vaginal colonization with lactobacillus spp.

which metabolize glycogen to produce lactic acid and maintain a low vaginal ph at a level at which many pathogens cannot flourish 1 2. in postmen- opausal women the genitourinary syndrome of menopause is as- sociated with a decrease in estrogen secretion leading to a deple- tion of lactobacilli and an increase in vaginal ph followed by colo- nization with enterobacteria.

from the clinical perspective vaginal dryness burning itching and dyspareunia are frequent com- plaints along with dysuria urinary frequency and recurrent in- fections 3 4.as a result of chemotherapy and estrogen deprivation therapy the genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a common finding among women with breast cancer bc.

only women without vaginal bleeding or abnormal vaginal discharge were eligible for study inclusion.

the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and the guidelines of good scien- tific practice and was supported by the head of the institute.resultspatientsa total of 62 postmenopausal women met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for eligibility.
