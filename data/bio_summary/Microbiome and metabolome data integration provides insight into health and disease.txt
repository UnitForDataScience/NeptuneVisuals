C The host can be added back into this network to find host- microbiome interactions.been observed on human skin.In addition gut mi- crobes have also been associated with breakdown and reactivation of a variety of drugs including the cardiovascular drug digoxin and the cancer drug irinotecan.IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT MICROBIALLY PRODUCED METABOLITES FOR HEALTH AND DISEASEStudies aimed to explore an association between mi- crobial metabolism and disease states often focus on well-characterized microbial metabolites such as SCFAs.However approaches that can identify novel bioactive microbial metabolites as mediators of microbiome-host or microbe-microbe interactions are increasingly being applied.

Integration of microbial and metabolo- mics data paired with experimental validation has promise for identifying microbial in- fluence on host physiology through production modification or degradation of bioactive metabolites.

Realization of microbial metabolic activities that affect health is hampered by gaps in our understanding of 1 biological properties of microbes and metabolites 2 which microbial enzymespathways produce which metabolites and 3 the effects of metabolites on hosts.

One challenge for generating testable hypotheses regarding mechanistic links be- tween microbial communities and disease is a lack of understanding of microbial function in disease causal- ity.

Most specialized metabolites their biosynthetic origins and their roles in microbiome- related disease remain understudied.A broad understanding of how the presence of a micro- biome affects the host metabolome has come from comparing germ-free GF mice ie mice with no associ- ated microbial communities to mice with colonizing microbes including 1 conventional mouse micro- biota2 the microbiota of different humans ie hu- manized mice or 3 specific individual bacterial species.Similarly other studies have compared the metabolomes of mice treated with antibiotics to nonantibiotic-treated controls.These studies have found that microbial colonizationcomposition has a profound influence on both the presence and relative abundances of many metabolites in various sites including the bloodurinefecesliver and ileum.

Microbiota colonization also results in differences in many small compounds of unknown identityfunction.Another way to estimate which metabolites in host samples originate from host vs microbial metabolism is to use metabolic networks described in databases such as KEGG.These networks capture the relation- ship between metabolites the enzymes that produce them and the organisms both host and microbial that contain genes encoding those enzymes  A.

One promising example is the treatment of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting mi- crobial production of TMA using a structural analog of choline that can inhibit microbial TMA lyases.Inanother example the amino acid arginine can inhibit enzymatic conversion of the cardiac drug digoxin into an inactive form by the gut microbe Eggerthella lenta indicating that coadministering this drug with arginine may prevent its deactivation by microbial enzymes.

For instance galactooligosaccharide mixtures defined in laboratory culture experiments to have particularly strong prebiotic properties for Bifidobacteria effectively increased the proportion of Bifidobacteria in the gut in a dose-dependent manner when given to healthy human volunteers.Use of genomic and meta- bolic data to design prebiotic strategies that target spe- cific microbes and metabolites will become more powerful as our knowledge bases of microbial enzymes and metabolites expand.Beneficial microbial metabolites can also be directly introduced to the host to circumvent the need for micro- bial production from dietary substrates a process referred to as ''microbiome-based metabolite treat- ment'' or ''postbiotics''.

Now microbiome research must move beyond correlations and general demonstra- tion of causality to develop mechanistic understandings of microbial influence including through their metabolic activities.

A potential way to address this gap is through the application of metabolomics with microbiome analysis.THE METABOLOMEAn important tool for understanding microbial com- munity function is metabolomics.
