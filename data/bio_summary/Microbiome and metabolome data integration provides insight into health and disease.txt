microbiota colonization also results in differences in many small compounds of unknown identityfunction.another way to estimate which metabolites in host samples originate from host vs microbial metabolism is to use metabolic networks described in databases such as kegg.these networks capture the relation- ship between metabolites the enzymes that produce them and the organisms both host and microbial that contain genes encoding those enzymes  a. these networks can in principle provide a framework for relating the genesenzymatic reactions present in the colonizing bacteria genomeshotgun metagenome the expression of those genes meta- transcriptome and presence of the encoded proteins meta-proteome and the metabolites metabolome in a sample b. they also provide a frameworkfor investigation of microbiomehost cometabolism c.linking microbiomemetabolome with the exposomeanother important level of complexity is how the me- tabolome and microbiome are linked with the exposome eg exogenous factors such pollutants hygiene prod- ucts and the diet.

c the host can be added back into this network to find host- microbiome interactions.been observed on human skin.in addition gut mi- crobes have also been associated with breakdown and reactivation of a variety of drugs including the cardiovascular drug digoxin and the cancer drug irinotecan.identifying important microbially produced metabolites for health and diseasestudies aimed to explore an association between mi- crobial metabolism and disease states often focus on well-characterized microbial metabolites such as scfas.however approaches that can identify novel bioactive microbial metabolites as mediators of microbiome-host or microbe-microbe interactions are increasingly being applied.

integration of microbial and metabolo- mics data paired with experimental validation has promise for identifying microbial in- fluence on host physiology through production modification or degradation of bioactive metabolites.

realization of microbial metabolic activities that affect health is hampered by gaps in our understanding of 1 biological properties of microbes and metabolites 2 which microbial enzymespathways produce which metabolites and 3 the effects of metabolites on hosts.

one challenge for generating testable hypotheses regarding mechanistic links be- tween microbial communities and disease is a lack of understanding of microbial function in disease causal- ity.

most specialized metabolites their biosynthetic origins and their roles in microbiome- related disease remain understudied.a broad understanding of how the presence of a micro- biome affects the host metabolome has come from comparing germ-free gf mice ie mice with no associ- ated microbial communities to mice with colonizing microbes including 1 conventional mouse micro- biota2 the microbiota of different humans ie hu- manized mice or 3 specific individual bacterial species.similarly other studies have compared the metabolomes of mice treated with antibiotics to nonantibiotic-treated controls.these studies have found that microbial colonizationcomposition has a profound influence on both the presence and relative abundances of many metabolites in various sites including the bloodurinefecesliver and ileum.

one promising example is the treatment of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting mi- crobial production of tma using a structural analog of choline that can inhibit microbial tma lyases.inanother example the amino acid arginine can inhibit enzymatic conversion of the cardiac drug digoxin into an inactive form by the gut microbe eggerthella lenta indicating that coadministering this drug with arginine may prevent its deactivation by microbial enzymes.

for instance galactooligosaccharide mixtures defined in laboratory culture experiments to have particularly strong prebiotic properties for bifidobacteria effectively increased the proportion of bifidobacteria in the gut in a dose-dependent manner when given to healthy human volunteers.use of genomic and meta- bolic data to design prebiotic strategies that target spe- cific microbes and metabolites will become more powerful as our knowledge bases of microbial enzymes and metabolites expand.beneficial microbial metabolites can also be directly introduced to the host to circumvent the need for micro- bial production from dietary substrates a process referred to as ''microbiome-based metabolite treat- ment'' or ''postbiotics''.

microbiome and metabolome data integration provides insight into health and diseasemichael shaffer abigail j. s. armstrong vanessa v. phelan nichole reisdorph and catherine a. lozuponeaurora colofor much of our history the most basic information about the microbial world has evaded characterization.

now microbiome research must move beyond correlations and general demonstra- tion of causality to develop mechanistic understandings of microbial influence including through their metabolic activities.

a potential way to address this gap is through the application of metabolomics with microbiome analysis.the metabolomean important tool for understanding microbial com- munity function is metabolomics.

for example stable oral microbial biofilm communities representing 60-80 of the taxonomic diversity of the original sample has been accomplishedwhereas fecal communities were recapitulated at 65-95. miniaturized bioreactors and chemostats may provide opportunities to maintain continuous culture of commu- nities removing concerns about sample limitation from patient donors particularly of microbiome niches that are not as easily accessible as stool.

for instance the anti-inflammatory microbial fermentation product butyrate has been added directly to the colonic environ- ment via enema in efforts to ameliorate inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis although only minor improvements were observed.the exploration of ''postbiotic'' therapies are in their infancy and poten- tially challenged by unintended effects of the compoundon gut microbiome composition and activity and diffi- culty in determining and delivering physiologically important levels of the metabolite to its active site in the body.personalized medicine.

for instance evaluation of the presence of digoxin-deactivating strains of the gut bacterium e. lenta has the potential to inform proper administration of this cardiac drug.another study suggested that urinary levels of the microbial product p-cresol sulfate as determined by 1h nmr spectroscopy could indicate the metabolic fate of acetaminophen.future directionsit has been over 8 years since we were all invited to the marriage of metagenomics and metabolomics and progress in integrating these data types and eluci- dating the function of key small molecules that are pro- duced by the microbiome is being made.

51because the organisms were invisible to the naked eye or uncultivable in the laboratory.considering how many ''unknown unknowns'' there were about the microbes that live in on and around us just 30 years ago the progress made in the field of microbiome research is remarkable.several key aspects of microbiome research have contributed to this rapid progress.
