We evaluate the performance of our model first on simu- lated data where we provide comparisons with methods developed for microbiome or similar type of data.

Thus when joining the samples from the 16S rRNA data and the KEGG orthology data a total of 79 matched samples remained.We used the same hyperparameter settings as in thethe intercept by setting the variance parameter to s2  10.simulation study that is s2  10 and r2  10 and setpj2m pjpjSimilarly we set rpj  10 to provide sufficiently vague prior information on the non-zero log-linear regression coefficients.

Well- established statistical models for the analysis of count data e.g.

Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution can be efficaciously employed for the analysis of taxonomic count data Although less common other distribu- tions e.g.

a two-parameter Weibull distribution have also been shown to provide a good fit to the data for some communities see e.g.

One distinctive characteristic of the microbiome data is their overdispersion while some taxa e.g.

multidimensional scaling to summarize abundances and are sometimes employed to link the microbiome data with available clinical covariates and phylogenetic information In those approaches the choice of the distance metric is often crucial.

Most importantly distance-based methods do not explicitly quantify the relative importance of sig- nificant associations between taxa and covariates and therefore are of limited use for clinical decisions.In this manuscript we consider an integrative Bayesian approach based on the use of Dirichlet-Multinomial DM distributions for studying the association between taxa abundance data and available measurements on clin- ical genetic and environmental covariates.

Similarly develop a struc- ture constrained version of sparse canonical correlation analysis that integrates compositionalized microbiome data phylogenetic information and nutrient information.
