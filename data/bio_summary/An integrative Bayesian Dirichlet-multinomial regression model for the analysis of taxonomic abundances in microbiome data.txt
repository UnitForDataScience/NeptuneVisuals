Those results appear to confirm the sparser selection achieved by our method consistently with the results of the simulation study.DiscussionA close investigation of the biological significance of the associations identified by our model reveals several interesting characteristics and affirms the relevance of these associations.

It is known that the combination of environmental and host genetic factors shape the composition of the gut micro- biota and these interactions appear to have a significant effect on several biological mechanisms which may be related for example to the individual immunity and bar- rier defense as well as metabolism and diet The approach has been implemented in a user-friendly R code which has been made publicly available see the Licensing Section.MethodsWe describe our Bayesian variable selection approach for the analysis of microbiome data and their association with a set of available covariates in the context of DM log-linear regression models.Dirichlet-multinomial regression with variable selection Let yi  yi1 ...  yiJ  indicate the vector of counts rep- resenting the taxonomic abundance table obtained fromthe ith patient with yij denoting the frequency of the jth microbial taxon for j  1 ...  J and i  1 ...  n. Fur- thermore let X  x1 ...  xP indicate a n x P matrix of measurements on P covariates.

However the use of a constrained optimization approach does not allow to fully characterize the uncertainty in the selection of the significant associations which is of particular impor- tance especially when dealing with high-dimensional and highly-correlated data.Here we propose a probabilistic modeling approach which both flexibly takes into account the typical features of microbiome count data and also allows for straight- forward incorporation of available covariate informa- tion within a DM log-linear regression framework.

By imposing sparsity inducing spike-and-slab priors on the regression coefficients our model obtains a parsimonious summary of the effects of the associations and also allows an assessment of the uncertainty of the selection process.

A selection of the significant associations can then be made by choos- ing those elements that have marginal PPIs greater than a specific value for example greater than 0.5 for the median probability model of Another choice for the threshold which controls for multiplicity relies on an estimated pre-specified Bayesian false discovery rate a calculated as 0.05 N bpj 0.01J x P 2F DRc Pp1Jj1Pp11 - PPIpj DpjJj1where sbpj is the current estimate of thevariance of the target distribution.

We define accuracy as ACC  TP  TNP  N with TP the num- ber of true positives out of P selected and TN the numberwhere x pj  x1j ...  xp-1j xp1j ...  xpj andbpj  b1j ...  bp-1j bp1j ...  bpj.For posterior inference we are interested in identify- ing the relevant associations between taxa and covariates as captured by the selection indicators xpj's and the cor- responding regression coefficients bpj's.

Finally we set m  0.01 or a  0.02 and b  1.98 resulting in a sparse prior mean on selected0.01 resulting in a sparse mean selection prior of 1 of the total 6080 possible associations.

These unexpected findings suggest the need for further investi- gations and validation.ConclusionHerein we have developed a Bayesian approach to the Dirichlet-Multinomial regression models that allows for the selection of significant associations between covari- ates and taxa from a microbiome abundance table by imposing spike-and-slab priors on the log-linear regres- sion coefficients of the model.

In these Figures the magnitude of the association as captured by the estimated bpj's is proportional to the width of the edges with red lines indicating negative associations and blue lines positive associations.

are known to participate in pyru- vate metabolism Since those associations should be driven exclusively by bacterial genes it is interesting that we find significant associations between the abun- dance of certain bacterial taxa and KEGG pathways that are primarily reported among eukaryotic species i.e.
