interestingly a significant positive correlation with a strong linear trend was calculated showing that the ratio of tlr5 expression in sampakr ilea increased as the mice aged and ileitis became more severe indicating a clear involvement of tlr5 not only at the onset but also in the potential worsening of disease.in fact several lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of tolerance to intestinal tlr-stimulants and disruption of the epithelial barrier separating mamps from responsive underlying tissues may contribute to the development or perpetuation of ibd.5 for example although it is well established that the pres- ence of luminal mamps is not sufficient to initiate ibds in ani- mal models53-55 it has been shown that tlr-mediated detection of some luminal mamps can exacerbate existing disease.54-56 moreover although the healthy gut contains appreciable quanti- ties of soluble ligands for tlr2 tlr4 and tlr5 the relative abundance of stimulants within the gut microbiota for these re- ceptors can increase dramatically during the course of experimen- tal ibd.23our earlier studies in fact showed that the commensal bacterial flora although not essential for the initiation of ileitis in the samp mouse strain plays a paramount role in the progressionand severity of gut inflammation characteristic of these mice.303335 specifically the small intestinal permeability defect that precedes ileitis in these mice33 as well as the ileitis pheno- type itself persists under gf conditions however the onset of disease is markedly delayed and the severity significantly damp- ened lacking the proinflammatory th2 immune component pres- ent in spf-raised samp.313235 in the present study our results provide evidence that the commensal microbiota also drives the expression of tlr5 on ilea iecs.

commensal-derived flagellin has been identified as a dominant antigen in patients with cd19 and about 50 of cd patients usually have abnormally high levels of anti- flagellin antibodies that correlate with particular subtypes of severe disease.2021 in animal studies infusion of intrarectal fla- gellin worsens the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis22 and oral administration of toxoplasma gondii induces a dramatic increase in the concentration of flagellin within the small intestine in which flagellin is normally low causing severe th1-mediated ileitis.23 together these findings suggest an asso- ciation of tlr5 with ibd particularly cd and that exposure of flagellin to either basolaterally-expressed tlr5 or subepithelial tlr5-expressing cells in the setting of a damaged mucosal bar- rier may have the ability to initiate andor perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation.conversely studies also document a downregulation of tlr5 in both animal models of colitis and patients with ibd.2425 as such the role of flagellintlr5 in the pathogenesis of ibd is controversial i.e.

irradiated samp receiving either wild-type akr or samp bone marrowbm developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal tlr5 compared with akr recipients of either samp or akr bone marrow neither of whichconferred ileitis suggesting that elevated tlr5 in native samp is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic e.g.

tlr5-specific ex vivo activation of samp ileal tissues decreased epithelial barrier resistance indicative of increased permeability and was accompanied by altered expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-3 occludin and zonula occludens-1.conclusions our results provide evidence that aberrant elevated tlr5 expression is present in the ileal epithelium of samp mice is augmented in the presence of the gut microbiome and that tlr5 activation in response to bacterial flagellin results in a deficiency to maintain appropriate epithelial barrier integrity.

pathogenic versus protective and the cell types that express tlr5 as well as the tlr5-dependent mechanisms that regulate gut permeability and homeostasis in response to the gut microbiome remain unclear.to gain more insight into how cell-specific expression and activation of tlr5 affects gut homeostasis and the potential development of chronic intestinal inflammation we investigated the role of flagellintlr5 in ileitis-prone samp1yitfc samp mice.

construction of reciprocal bone marrow chimeras bmcs suggested that elevated levelsof tlr5 in samp are derived from the nonhematopoietic compartment which was confirmed in isolated iecs that expressed increased tlr5 mrna and protein levels.

1. these data show that tlr5 is one of the most abundantly expressed tlrs in the ilea and colons of young uninflamed samp mice and is potently  395figure 1. tlr5 is increased in ilea and colons of young unin- flammed samp mice and in older samp with established disease.

results are expressed as relative mean 6 sem n  6group with the value for tlr2 in 4-week-old akr set arbitrarily as 1 p  0.01 versus tlr5 in age-matched akrs.upregulated in older samp with established disease versus age- matched akr controls.iec-derived tlr5 and circulating anti- flagellin igg levels are increased early during samp ileitis and both are abrogated in the absence of the commensal microfloraour previous studies showed that a primary epithelial barrier defect is present early in the small intestine of 3-week-old samp mice before the onset of ileal inflammation that likely drives ileitis and persists even in a gf setting.33 samp mice however still display ileal inflammation albeit delayed and attenuated when raised under gf conditions compared with age-matched spf-raised samp35 indicating that importance of the interactions between the commensal microflora and the intestinal epithelium in this model.

we therefore evaluated epithelial-derived tlr5 and the impact of the gut microbiome on tlr5 expression during samp ileitis.we first extended our prior findings and measured small intestinal epithelial permeability in 20-week-old samp raised in396  a gf environment and compared them with age-matched samp and akr raised under spf conditions.

also similar to trends observed at the mrna level although tlr5 protein levels were greater in iec from older versus younger mice independent of strain tlr5 protein in ileal iec from samp were markedly greater than their respective age-matched akr controls see fig.

a tlr5 in 4-week-old spf samp n 14 11 compared with both control spf akr n 14 10 and gf samp n 14 6 and in 20-week-old spf samp with established disease n 14 9 compared with age- matched spf akr n 14 7 and gf samp n 14 6. results are expressed as relative mean 6 sem with the value for 4-week-old gf samp set arbitrarily as 1 p  0.05 p  0.01 and p  0.001. b the ratio of tlr5 in sampakr ilea was analyzed in 4- 10- 20- and 40-week-old mice n  6group with average taken for each time point and plotted.

c igg antibodies against flagellin were measured by elisa in serum samples from samp and akr mice raised in conventionally- housed spf conditions n 14 30 and n 14 20 respectively as well as samp mice raised under gf conditions n 14 15. results are expressed as mean 6 sem p  0.05 p  0.01.398  bmcs with samp- but not akr-derived nonhematopoietic compartments express high levels of tlr5 and display severe ileitis that is dependent on the commensal bacterial florato confirm the primary source of tlr5 and the importance of the gut microbiome in samp ileitis reciprocal bmcs using samp and akr mouse strains as well as sampsamp and akrakr controls were constructed as previously described3334 and subsequently treated with a cocktail of broad spectrum abxs consisting of ampicillin vancomycin neomycin and metronidazole.

taken together these data indicate that the mucosal sur- face of samp ilea is exposed to a greater bacterial load com- pared with akr controls early during the progression of ileitis and that bmcs constructed with a pathogenic nonhema- topoietic compartment akrsamp and sampsamp display elevated tlr5 and severe ileitis that is abrogated by abx treatment.figure 4. tlr5 is dependent on status of bm recipient hosts with samp epithelium exposed to greater bacterial load than akr controls.
