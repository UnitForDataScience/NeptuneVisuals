central to grazing ruminants are the nutrient and energy transfor- mations in the rumen that are driven by a complex com- munity of largely uncharacterized microbes  this microbial consortia can utilize a broad range of sub- strates including cellulose-rich substrates of mainly indi- gestible plant material and convert it into energy sources such as volatile fatty acids vfas and microbial cell protein for host absorption and metabolism the synergistic actions of rumen microbes and assimilation of fermentation end products account for  70 of the ruminant animal's energy needs this is far greater than the contribution of hindgut fermentation to energy acquisition in monogastric mammals  10-30 due to the influence of rumen microbes on host nutri- ent acquisition rumen microbial community compos- ition has been linked to host feed efficiency and animal productivity measures while there is a growing understanding of the importance of rumen mi- crobes in regard to ruminant health and productivity the roles of viruses in shaping rumen microbial commu- nities and in turn ecosystem function are not well established.viruses influence microbial community compositionand function through a number of processes including both top-down and bottom-up effects resulting from cell lysis horizontal gene transfer metabolic reprogramming and active lysogeny - multitrophic ecosystem modeling of surface oceans has demonstrated viral- mediated lysis increases recycling of organic matter and net primary productivity in addition to the effects of predation viruses often acquire host-derived auxiliary metabolic genes amgs that augment and redirect cell metabolism to bolster viral replication .

these phyla are commonly associated with the rumen ecosystem diet and host animal influence the population and functional response of rumen microbial and viral communitiesusing the abundances of viral populations and bacterial otus across samples we explored the global effects of diet on viral and bacterial diversity in the rumen.

most metal- loproteases contain zinc and rumen bacteria pro- duce an abundance of metalloproteases as such zinc likely plays an important role in rumen bacterial enzyme function and in-turn rumen metabolism.

future work on rumen viral-host dy- namics should consider the relationship between micro- bial density viral counts and viral lifestyle a shift in viral lifestyle driven by dietary factors could have profound impacts on rumen microbial communities including a relative decrease in viral predation when microbial densities are high and selective mortality upon induction of prophages table 3 core viral populationscore viral populations were defined as having at least 15 coverage in 80 or more of the rumen viral metagenomes.

below we focus on detailing the potential roles of selected amgs in rumen carbon folate queuosine and sulfur metabolism.nearly all viral amgs to date have been identified from marine environments and while the rumen and ocean are disparate ecosystems with unique ecological drivers marine amgs can serve as a framework to un- derstanding preliminary amgs identified from the rumen and other gut environments.

a core subset of viruses has implications for understand- ing the general principles of microbial establishment in the rumen and the ubiquitous nature of certain mem- bers of the rumen microbiome more viral metagen- omes from an expanded number of animals and ruminant species are needed to identify the composition of the core rumen virome and to better identify putative viral-host relationships among these core microbial populations.lastly we explored the role of viruses in influencing host microbial metabolism through virally encoded amgs in low and high tdn diets.

rumen plasmids have been shown to cross phyla and be enriched for niche-specific functions that may provide advantages to their microbial hosts  a more complete characterization of the rumen viromes meta- bolic potential would be captured through sequencing both extracellular viruses and induced prophages in summary this preliminary study addresses fundamen- tal ecological questions of rumen viral ecology including the redundancy and responsiveness of viruses during various dietary perturbations that provide a necessary foundation for future hypotheses.methodsfeeding and sample collectionthe university of nebraska-lincoln institutional ani- mal care and use committee approved animal care and management procedures.

however little is known about the processes shaping the distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses may modulate microbial-driven processes in the rumen.

while rumen viruses were dynamic 14 near ubiquitous viral populations were identified suggesting the presence of a core rumen virome largely comprised of novel viruses.

our results show that rumen viruses have implications for understanding the structuring of the previously identified core rumen microbiota and impacting microbial metabolism through a vast array ofamgs.

a single study in sheep using pulse-field gel electrophoresis has suggested a potential influence of diet on rumen viruses  however metagenomics would provide a deeper understanding of the potential effect of diet on rumen viruses.

those that have utilized a metagenomic approach to study rumen viruses have focused on characterizing the composition and variation in the virome between animals fed the same diet and not identified ecological drivers of viral communities - these previously published metagenomes indi- cate that rumen viruses potentially encode amgs asso- ciated with a variety of pathways.
