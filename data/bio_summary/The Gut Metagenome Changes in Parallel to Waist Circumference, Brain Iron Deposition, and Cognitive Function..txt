a trend was observed with worsening of visual- spatial constructional ability 2. interestingly the increase in circulating b-amyloid ab42 levels was posi- tively associated with the change in visual-spatial con- structional ability and immediate memory and negatively with the increase in r2  with the former in line with other longitudinal studies this could seem counter- intuitive but a decrease in ab42 levels are thought to reflect compartmentalization of ab peptides in the brain and have been related to the development of alzheimer's disease copy memory scores were inversely associated with r2 at the left caudate r  20.409 p  0.034 left and right pallidum r  20.383 p  0.048 and r  20.524 p  0.005respectively and right putamen r  20.575 p  0.002.immediate and deferred memory scores were inversely associated with r2 at the right thalamus r  20.403 p and r  20.395 p  0.041. worse tmt-a scores were associated with increased r2 at the right and left pallidum r  0.440 p  0.024 and r  0.529 p  0.005. fasting glucose glycated hemoglobin and low high- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels improved at follow- up after dietary recommendations in subjects withobesity.

the percent change in bmi was positively cor- related with the ra of bacteria belonging to caldiserica phylum r  0.602 p  0.029 in the control group and negatively correlated with armatimonadetes r  20.78 p  0.004 and synergistetes r  20.60 p  0.023 in subjects with obesity at baseline.hic was higher in those subjects with obesity at baseline p  0.001 and follow-up p  0.007 and associated with increased r2 at left amygdala r  0.346 p  0.043 caudate r  0.501 p  0.002 pallidum r  0.380 p  0.024 and putamen r  0.447 p  0.007 atbaseline.

mr relaxation rates of r2 based on the contribution of paramagnetic ferritin-loaded cells to the t2 relaxation signal is a well-established method for brain iron as- sessment in animal models and in humans increased brain iron load at the basal ganglia amygdala and hippocampus has been associated with worse cognitive performance executive functions and verbal working memory scores - of note basal ganglia are involved in emotional associative motivational and cognitive functions whereas the thalamus and striatum are mainly implicated in sensory and motor mechanisms including response selection and initiation more recently increased brain iron load by means of relaxation rates of r2 was found to be linked to worse cognitive test scores related to motor speed attention and memory in subjects with obesity we hypothesized that changes in brain structure andcognitive function are associated with shifts in gut microbiome in middle-aged subjects.

hic was inversely associated with bacteroidetes at follow-up r  20.559 p  0.002. the percent of hic change was positively correlated with the percent of change in bmi r  0.355 p  0.036 actinobacteria r  0.407 p  0.039 and cloacimonetes r  0.599 p  0.004 but no association with brain r2 changes was found.

interestingly metagenome functions associated with circulating and brain iron stores are involved in bacterial generation of siderophores.conclusions changes in the gut metagenome are associated longitudinally with cognitive function and brain iron deposition.

these findings are in line with brain iron deposition linked to cognitive status in middle-aged subjects in concordance with other studies we found the ra of prevotellaceae positively correlated with bmi whereas the ra of bacteroidaceae rikenellaceae and lachno- spiraceae was negatively associated in summary changes in brain iron and cognitive function run in parallel to specific bacterial phyla of the gut microbiota.

the ra of prevotellaceae correlated posi- tively with bmi r  0.34 p  0.031 whereas the ra of bacteroidaceae r  20.34 p  0.03 rikenellaceae r  20.46 p  0.002 and lachnospiraceae r  20.35 p  0.02 was negatively correlated.we also observed changes when subjects were clas- sified according to weight loss versus weight gain in- dependent of being obese or not supplemental table 1. of note gut microbiome composition interacted with these relationships.

in the right caudate nucleus the increase in r2 was more accentuated in young subjects below the median age of the sample and tended to be different in men and women p  0.06. after adjusting for age and sex the increase in chlorobi bacteroidetes proteobacteria and gemmati- monadetes ra was positively associated with the increase in r2 in the right caudate nucleus in parallel to a lowertable 1.clinical data neuropsychological scores and brain relaxometry r2according to study groups at baseline and 2-year follow-upcontrol group n  18subjects with obesity n  17differences between study groupssubjects included in the mr analysisbaselinefollow-upbaselinefollow-upbaseline follow-upmedian q1-q3median q1-q3p valuemedian q1-q3median q1-q3p value p valuep valueage y50 39-56.2552 42-59.50.00053 48-5856 51.5-600.0000.203 0.186sex female frequency8 --- ----11 --- ----0315--waist circumference cm84 74.25-91.590 76-970.004125.5 122-134114 97.5-1340.2890.0000.000bmi kgm223.3 21.6-25.8223.9 21.52-25.720.33845.1 39.1-47.4536.5 29.55-44.10.0370.0000.000fasting glucose mgdl88 83.5-9696 86.5-1010.177100 92.5-10390 86.5-1050.3510.0340.718glycated hemoglobin 5.45 5.27-5.625.4 5.1-5.50.0045.8 5.45-6.055.5 5.2-5.80.0630.0200.066triglycerides mgdl61 43-9962 48.5-900.40899 68.5-15096 68.5-1330.3010.0220.032ldl-cholesterol mgdl126 91.75-143.25114 99-138.50.856113 100-148.598.5 72-1330.0230.9740.101hdl-cholesterol mgdl64 51-7766 53.5-750.44846 43-54.556.5 48.25-69.50.0320.0260.227ferritin ngml74 38-12580 48-1190.653130 74-222123 80-1480.0230.0290.162circulating b-amyloid pgml33.57 30.71-38.8136.4 29.18-42.410.46336.04 28.27-40.939.8 35.04-42.870.1400.8560.317control group n  14subjects with obesity n  13subjects included in the gut metagenome analysisbaselinefollow-upbaselinefollow-upbaseline follow-upmedian q1-q3median q1-q3p valuemedian q1-q3median q1-q3p valuep valuep valueage y54 40-5842.5 57-60.50.00053.5 48-5856.5 50.75-60.250.0010.770 0.771sex female frequency6 --- ----9 --- ----0.573waist circumference cm83 73.5-9291.5 76-1030.007128.5 122.5-135128.5 103-1380.8380.000 0.001bmi kgm223.2 21.4-25.6523.8 21.35-26.30.10846.15 39.35-48.0238.85 33.35-45.320.2090.0000.000acidobacteria0.018 0.012-0.0260.013 0.01-0.020.2490.014 0.007-0.0210.014 0.007-0.0250.4700.1330.627actinobacteria6.236 4.943-8.71810.37 4.27-11.520.0876.503 3.352-11.763 7.373 4.568-9.0030.9751.0000.467aquificae0.006 0.005-0.008 0.004 0.003-0.0060.0160.005 0.004-0.0060.005 0.003-0.0060.4700.0890.627armatimonadetes0 0-0.0010.001 0-0.0010.6000 0-0.0010 0-0.0010.2210.4090.734bacteroidetes19.05 16.3-35.5228.9 26.38-37.020.11620.07 12.2-23.9822.28 16.33-31.260.4330.3820.052caldiserica0 0-0.0010 0-0.0010.7530 0-00 0-00.7300.6600.052candidatus saccharibacteria0.001 0.001-0.0010.001 0-0.0010.6000.001 0.001-0.0020.001 0-0.0020.1240.5440.884continuedtable 1.continuedcontrol group n  14subjects with obesity n  13subjects included in the gut metagenome analysisbaselinefollow-upbaselinefollow-upbaseline follow-upmedian q1-q3median q1-q3p valuemedian q1-q3median q1-q3p valuep valuep valuedeinococcus thermus0.029 0.023-0.045 0.023 0.016-0.0360.2210.029 0.016-0.0350.024 0.009-0.0410.7300.3570.846dictyoglomi0.002 0.001-0.003 0.002 0.001-0.0020.4220.002 0.001-0.0020.001 0.001-0.0030.2450.2440.808elusimicrobia0.001 0-0.0010 0-0.0020.1520.001 0-0.0010.001 0-0.0010.3310.1730.610fibrobacteres0.009 0.008-0.0120.007 0.005-0.010.0190.009 0.006-0.0110.009 0.004-0.0120.9750.7710.528firmicutes67.86 51.86-73.47 55.47 48.01-59.450.01166.34 54.42-73.5564.64 52.62-70.70.3310.8840.120fusobacteria0.111 0.096-0.1340.082 0.07-0.1070.0280.105 0.085-0.110.1 0.087-0.1150.7780.3080.174gemmatimonadetes0.001 0.001-0.0020.001 0-0.0010.1730.001 0-0.0010.001 0.001-0.0020.0840.0890.244ignavibacteriae0.003 0.001-0.003 0.002 0.001-0.0020.0190.002 0.001-0.0020.002 0.001-0.0030.1980.0420.627nitrospirae0.003 0.002-0.003 0.002 0.001-0.0030.0460.002 0.001-0.0030.002 0.001-0.0030.8260.1090.560planctomycetes0.011 0.006-0.015 0.006 0.005-0.0090.1520.007 0.004-0.0090.006 0.004-0.0130.5510.0810.961proteobacteria2.759 2.539-3.605 2.989 2.399-3.6060.7532.936 2.055-3.5113.072 2.004-8.2250.3970.8840.593spirochetes0.186 0.156-0.270.171 0.147-0.1840.1160.161 0.136-0.2010.177 0.123-0.2030.5510.0990.771synergistetes0.127 0.093-0.239 0.102 0.079-0.1420.1730.112 0.064-0.1390.119 0.047-0.2130.4330.2070.846tenericutes0.035 0.022-0.049 0.018 0.016-0.0590.4630.025 0.018-0.0350.023 0.018-0.0280.5510.1090.771thermodesulfobacteria0.001 0-0.0020.001 0-0.0010.4220 0-0.0010.001 0-0.0010.5940.0730.771thermotoga0.009 0.007-0.0140.007 0.006-0.010.1160.009 0.007-0.010.01 0.006-0.010.7780.4380.332verrucomicrobia0.03 0.016-0.0560.03 0.009-0.4180.9720.021 0.008-0.1070.037 0.015-0.1030.8260.5600.734qualitative variables are expressed as frequencies and quantitative variables are expressed as median q1-q3.

j clin endocrinol metab 102 2962-2973 2017ecent advances in research have described the po- tential role of gut microbiome on broad aspects of human health including emotional behavior and cog- nition through the gut-brain axis 1 2. perturbations in the gut microbiome have been implicated in the devel- opment of obesity and related complications obesity and weight variations have been associated with altered representation of bacterial genes reduced bacterial di- versity and changes in the relative abundance ra of the two dominant phyla the bacteroidetes and the firmicutes in particular an elevated ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes increases in members of the phylum fir- micutes or decreases in the phylum bacteroidetes has been found in subjects with obesity whereas a decrease in this ratio has been found in relation to weight loss 5 6. increased gut microbiome diversity also correlates with lower weight gain in humans independent of calorieintake and other confounders crosstalk among the gastrointestinal tract gut micro- biome and central nervous system has been implicated in the regulation of gut function in both healthy and diseased states .

there are well-established methods to convert liver mr signal intensities into values of iron expressed in micromoles per gram 18. however to our knowledge there are not any established method to convert t2 signal intensity decay into micromoles per gram of iron in brain.

previous studies showed positive associations between hepatic iron concentrations hics and brain iron load by means of mr signal in middle-aged subjects with obesity  thus hic was assessed using signal intensity ratio from a single slice t2 and proton density acquisitions tr 140 ms te  14 ms and tr  140 ms te 4 ms respectively.

outer circle indicates type of variable clustered.given that obese subjects exhibited increased brain iron content linked to cognitive dysfunction we anticipated an improvement of iron deposition with diet- induced weight loss.

through these underlying mechanisms preclinical evidence indicates the potential relationship between the gut microbiome and hypothalamic-pituitary axis involving alterations in emotional behavior anxiety depression stress response and working memory 2 .however in contrast to the strong preclinical evi- dence there is only suggestive evidence that a similar relationship might exist in humans a preliminary study found an association among bacterial diversity shannon diversity index the ra of bacteria belonging to actinobacteria phylum microstructural changes at the hypothalamus caudate nuclei hippocampus thalamus and amygdala and worse cognitive test scores related tospeed and attention on the other hand the intake of probiotics containing bifidobacterium streptococcus lactobacillus and lactococcus induced changes in the brain response to an emotional faces attention task and beneficial effects on anxiety- and depression-related be- haviors .magnetic resonance mr has been widely used for noninvasive assessment of structural metabolic and functional brain changes in apparently healthy subjects.
