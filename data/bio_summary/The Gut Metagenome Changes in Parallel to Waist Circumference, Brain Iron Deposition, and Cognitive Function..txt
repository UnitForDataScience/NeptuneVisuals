MR relaxation rates of R2 based on the contribution of paramagnetic ferritin-loaded cells to the T2 relaxation signal is a well-established method for brain iron as- sessment In animal models and in humans increased brain iron load at the basal ganglia amygdala and hippocampus has been associated with worse cognitive performance executive functions and verbal working memory scores - Of note basal ganglia are involved in emotional associative motivational and cognitive functions whereas the thalamus and striatum are mainly implicated in sensory and motor mechanisms including response selection and initiation More recently increased brain iron load by means of relaxation rates of R2 was found to be linked to worse cognitive test scores related to motor speed attention and memory in subjects with obesity We hypothesized that changes in brain structure andcognitive function are associated with shifts in gut microbiome in middle-aged subjects.

Interestingly metagenome functions associated with circulating and brain iron stores are involved in bacterial generation of siderophores.Conclusions Changes in the gut metagenome are associated longitudinally with cognitive function and brain iron deposition.

These findings are in line with brain iron deposition linked to cognitive status in middle-aged subjects In concordance with other studies we found the RA of Prevotellaceae positively correlated with BMI whereas the RA of Bacteroidaceae Rikenellaceae and Lachno- spiraceae was negatively associated In summary changes in brain iron and cognitive function run in parallel to specific bacterial phyla of the gut microbiota.

Previous studies showed positive associations between hepatic iron concentrations HICs and brain iron load by means of MR signal in middle-aged subjects with obesity  Thus HIC was assessed using signal intensity ratio from a single slice T2 and proton density acquisitions TR 140 ms TE  14 ms and TR  140 ms TE 4 ms respectively.

Outer circle indicates type of variable clustered.Given that obese subjects exhibited increased brain iron content linked to cognitive dysfunction we anticipated an improvement of iron deposition with diet- induced weight loss.

Accordingly we aimed to examine gut microbiome brain microstructure by means of R2 values and validated neurocognitive test in middle-aged lean and obese subjects over a 2-year period in which the obese subjects were encouraged to lose weight.Materials and MethodsStudy designFrom January to September 2012 we undertook a cross- sectional case-control study-based MR iron assessment in25 middle-aged subjects with obesity body mass index BMI .30 kgm2 age range 30 to 65 years in whom type 2 diabetes and transferrin saturation .45 were specifi- cally excluded.

Through these underlying mechanisms preclinical evidence indicates the potential relationship between the gut microbiome and hypothalamic-pituitary axis involving alterations in emotional behavior anxiety depression stress response and working memory 2 .However in contrast to the strong preclinical evi- dence there is only suggestive evidence that a similar relationship might exist in humans A preliminary study found an association among bacterial diversity Shannon diversity index the RA of bacteria belonging to Actinobacteria phylum microstructural changes at the hypothalamus caudate nuclei hippocampus thalamus and amygdala and worse cognitive test scores related tospeed and attention On the other hand the intake of probiotics containing Bifidobacterium Streptococcus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus induced changes in the brain response to an emotional faces attention task and beneficial effects on anxiety- and depression-related be- haviors .Magnetic resonance MR has been widely used for noninvasive assessment of structural metabolic and functional brain changes in apparently healthy subjects.

Increased gut microbiome diversity also correlates with lower weight gain in humans independent of calorieintake and other confounders Crosstalk among the gastrointestinal tract gut micro- biome and central nervous system has been implicated in the regulation of gut function in both healthy and diseased states .

Interestingly several of the functions associated with body iron stores are involved in the generation of siderophores in bacteria phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldol- ases and phosphoenolpyruvate Also of note the function gluconate was not only associated with serum ferritin at baseline and at follow-up but also with iron content in the left caudate nucleus at baseline with R2 at the left putamen nucleus at follow-up whereas the percent change in this function was also positivelyFigure 5.

Extracellular gluconate has been described to promote dissolution of Fe minerals There is a large increase in gluconate secretion from bacteria with changing iron in the environment Some specific phyla were as- sociated with systemic and tissue markers of iron in parallel to decreased immediate and visual-spatial con- structional ability.
