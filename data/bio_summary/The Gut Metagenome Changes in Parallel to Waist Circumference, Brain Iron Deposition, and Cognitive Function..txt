The percent change in BMI was positively cor- related with the RA of bacteria belonging to Caldiserica phylum r  0.602 P  0.029 in the control group and negatively correlated with Armatimonadetes r  20.78 P  0.004 and Synergistetes r  20.60 P  0.023 in subjects with obesity at baseline.HIC was higher in those subjects with obesity at baseline P  0.001 and follow-up P  0.007 and associated with increased R2 at left amygdala r  0.346 P  0.043 caudate r  0.501 P  0.002 pallidum r  0.380 P  0.024 and putamen r  0.447 P  0.007 atbaseline.

Interestingly the increase in circulating b-amyloid Ab42 levels was posi- tively associated with the change in visual-spatial con- structional ability and immediate memory and negatively with the increase in R2  with the former in line with other longitudinal studies This could seem counter- intuitive but a decrease in Ab42 levels are thought to reflect compartmentalization of Ab peptides in the brain and have been related to the development of Alzheimer's disease Copy memory scores were inversely associated with R2 at the left caudate r  20.409 P  0.034 left and right pallidum r  20.383 P  0.048 and r  20.524 P  0.005respectively and right putamen r  20.575 P  0.002.Immediate and deferred memory scores were inversely associated with R2 at the right thalamus r  20.403 P and r  20.395 P  0.041.

The RA of Prevotellaceae correlated posi- tively with BMI r  0.34 P  0.031 whereas the RA of Bacteroidaceae r  20.34 P  0.03 Rikenellaceae r  20.46 P  0.002 and Lachnospiraceae r  20.35 P  0.02 was negatively correlated.We also observed changes when subjects were clas- sified according to weight loss versus weight gain in- dependent of being obese or not Supplemental Table 1.

The percent of HIC change was positively correlated with the percent of change in BMI r  0.355 P  0.036 Actinobacteria r  0.407 P  0.039 and Cloacimonetes r  0.599 P  0.004 but no association with brain R2 changes was found.

The in- crease in Thermodesulfobacteria RA was also indepen- dently and positively associated with Ab42 at follow-up P  0.008.Regarding the metagenome we focused on thosefunctions significantly associated with systemic iron stores measured as serum ferritin concentration at both baseline and follow-up.

MR relaxation rates of R2 based on the contribution of paramagnetic ferritin-loaded cells to the T2 relaxation signal is a well-established method for brain iron as- sessment In animal models and in humans increased brain iron load at the basal ganglia amygdala and hippocampus has been associated with worse cognitive performance executive functions and verbal working memory scores - Of note basal ganglia are involved in emotional associative motivational and cognitive functions whereas the thalamus and striatum are mainly implicated in sensory and motor mechanisms including response selection and initiation More recently increased brain iron load by means of relaxation rates of R2 was found to be linked to worse cognitive test scores related to motor speed attention and memory in subjects with obesity We hypothesized that changes in brain structure andcognitive function are associated with shifts in gut microbiome in middle-aged subjects.

The percent change in anthropometric and analytical parameters between baseline and follow-up were calculated as follow-up - baselinebaseline 3 100.MR imaging acquisition and image preprocessingAll subjects were studied on a 1.5T Gyroscan Intera system Philips Health Care Best The Netherlands with an eight- channel head coil.

The averages of the measurements of liver and muscle signal intensities were used to estimate the hepatic iron.Image analysisAll calculated maps were analyzed using SPM8 Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience Institute of Neurology London UK running MATLAB 7.7 The MathWorks Natick MA on a Windows 7 computer.

The participants were asked to say words beginning with the letter P and to say words per- taining to the animals category.

The significant increase in the relaxation rates in a specific area is highlighted in red P  0.0001.Figure 2.
