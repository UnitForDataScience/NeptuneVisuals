The Nuclear Over-hauser Enhancement spectroscopy one dimensional NOESY-Presat-1-D and the two dimensional 2-D J-resolved J-RES experimental set- tings were used The NOESY-Presat-1-D is the most suitable experiment in water suppressed 1H NMR.

The pulse sequence of the NOESY-Presat-1-D spectra was RD 90-t1 90-tm 90 - acquire FID using 1 scan 4 dummy scans spectrum width SW29.99 ppm 65 k time and frequency domain data points line broad- ening LB 0.3 Hz relaxation delay RD 4 s t1 4 usec and tm 0.01 s. The J-RES is a 2-D experiment which is used to solve the over-lapping resonance of the peaks.

The AUROC is efficient and rec- ommended statistical tool to evaluate models in metabolomics studies particularly in two groups models The SIMCA mis- classification tool was used to indicate the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of each model.

The pathway analysis of the identified biomarkers reflected that multifactorial con- ditions are associated with clopidogrel HTPR.

The CYP2C19 polymorphism is the main genetic variability interfering with clopi- dogrel response.

The 1H NMR does not require prior sample sep- aration or derivatization which make it fast and reliable technique for metabolic profiling.

The interest in using urine as biofluid sam- ple in metabolomics studies has gained great attention This is due to the advantages of being non-invasive sample available in abundance does not require pre-processing and it is plentiful with metabolites which can reveal significant signatures of disease and drug response.

The SC blood tube was used to perform the VN-P2Y12 test.

The electronic quality control test EQC of the instrument was run every day before the run of the VN-P2Y12 test.

The P2Y12 reaction unit PRU represents the post-dose platelets aggregation which is induced by ADP and prostaglandin E1 PGE1 in the PRU chamber of the kit.
