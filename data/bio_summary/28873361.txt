for instance one patient of the car- diogenic deaths encountered in the current study was carrier of the cyp2c192 homozygous mutation 22 and non-carrier of 3 allele patient iii in while the other patient was non-carrier of both 2 and 3 alleles patient ii in nevertheless both patients had intensified peaks of pre-dose biomarkers on the other hand the identified clopidogrel htpr metabotypes in this study shed light on the multifactorial nature of clopidogrel htpr as illustrated in the metabolic patterns of cardiometabolic diseases such as t2-dm heart failure hf and obesity were apparently manifested in clopidogrel htpr urinary metabotypes.

although there are known genetic and non-genetic factors associated with clopidogrel htpr which explain in part clopidogrel htpr yet great portion remains unknown often hindering person- alizing antiplatelet therapy.

however some patients endure clopidogrel high on treatment platelets reactivity htpr which can cause st and recurrence of ischemic events after pci there are genetic and non-genetic factors contributing to clopidogrel htpr.

among known non-genetic fac- tors causing clopidogrel htpr there are type two diabetes mellitus t2-dm chronic kidney disease ckd age obesity as well as increased exposure to adenosine diphosphate adp stimulation however large part of clopidogrel htpr remains un-explained.

to date pharmacometabolomics has never been used to investigate clopidogrel htpr.in a recent paper we reported that cyp2c192 allele and ele- vated body mass index bmi were associated with clopidogrel htpr among east asian coronary artery disease cad patients who were planned for interventional angiographic procedure iap however we found that genotyping of the cyp2c192 didn't pre- dict clopidogrel htpr efficiently.

5. multifactorial of clopidogrel htpr urinary metabotypes.clopidogrel htpr urinary metabotypes contained distinctive metabolic signatures of other cardio-associated conditions such as t2-dm hf obesity phospholipidosis and atherosclerosis.

the pharmacometabolomics phenotyping in this study revealed profound existence of t2-dm metabolic patterns in clopido- grel htpr metabotypes nevertheless there were no significant differences in pru and inh between t2-dm and non-dm patients  elevation in urinary fructose glucose lactate betaine choline dma tmao hippuric acid taurine creatine cre- atinine glycine histidine 3-methylhistidine threonine serine myo-inositol 2-oxoglutaric acid pag pa-glut dimethylglycine and gluconic acid were previously reported t2-dm metabolic biomarkers indeed t2-dm is associated with high platelets reactivity which often hinders the effectiveness of clopidogrel however since glucose fructose and lactate are biomarkers of acute and long term glycaemic dysregulations one can infer that the t2-dm-clopidogrel htpr association is sub- stantially affected by glycaemic control.

although some reports indicated an association between ckd and clopidogrel htpr leng and colleagues concluded that ckd in elderly is not associated with clopidogrel htpr and it may be reflecting ckd associated anaemia.

this approach did not only identify clopidogrel htpr putative biomarkers but also revealed new knowledge on the ambiguous part of clopidogrel htpr.
