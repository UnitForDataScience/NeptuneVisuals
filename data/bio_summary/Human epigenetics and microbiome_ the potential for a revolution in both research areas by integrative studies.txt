And the few popular paradigms such as the heavily cited histone deacetylation in human colonocytes by microbially derived butyrate 7 probably still need to be refined.Challenges  potential directions for integrative human microbiome  epigenetic researchNow combining human epigenetic and microbiome research is surely easier said than done.

A reductionist approach is advised to explore both epigenetic controlling of the human microbiome and how human microbiome and metabolome can modulate human epigenetic regulation.10.4155fsoa-2017-0046Future Sci.

It is already known that the dynamic nature of human epigenetics is a sig- nificant hurdle for clinical translation of basic research and the human microbiome which is both personalized and dynamic is probably an additional significant confounder.So why try to correlate epigenetics  microbiomeFirst as we reported last year 1 the extent to which epigenetic mechanisms modulate healthy or commensal microbes is virtually unknown let alone how those processes are influenced and what influence they can have on their surrounding environment.

It makes per- fect sense that the host-associated microbiome may be the ultimate environmental trigger for epigenetic processes because of its spatial location and ability to convert environmen- tal and diet-derived compounds before they reach human cells.

While the inherent limitations of such an approach are gener- ally well discussed the fact that epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the vast majority of human microbiome members is unknown represents another major limita- tion that has so far been ignored.

While this approach should arguably reduce confounding factors it would have to be primarily applied to animal mod- els since human colonic biopsy sampling is relatively uncommon and may not even allow for studying both microbiome and host epigenetics.There has also been extensive research into chemical compounds that could serve as epigenetic drugs 15.

Since gut microbiome and gut and urine metabolome appear to correlate well enough that the urine metabolome can be used as a proxy 18 it is possible that stool andor urine would actually be the appropriate parameter to combine with host epigenetics profiling-based studies.ConclusionTo summarize there is interest and rationale to consider the human microbiome as a novel and crucial para- meter in clinical epigenetic research.

Mycoplasma CG- and GATC-specific DNA methyltransferases selectively and efficiently methylate the host genome and alter the epigenetic landscape in human cells.

From such a baseline it would then become possible to start hypothesis-based studies.While linking host epigenetic profiles with gut microbiome profiles has been attempted in a few pre- vious studies 1314 this kind of approach should prob- ably be limited to cases where a relatively clear-cut segregation power has been identified in either the epi-...epigenetic drugs may readily be produced in situ by specific microbes and molecules of inter-est may actually be degraded or inactivated by microbial activity.genetic or the microbiome profile.
