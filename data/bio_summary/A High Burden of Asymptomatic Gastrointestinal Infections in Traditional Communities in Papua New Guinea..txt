There was no observable dif- ference in population numbers of key groups of the normal gut flora in study participants who were pathogen carriage posi- tive compared with those who were negative for the carriage of pathogens 1.Our study detected unexpectedly high rates of pathogen carriage particularly norovirus and shigella in asymptomatic people in the highland communities in Papua New Guinea.

This cycle can have major implications on the health and wealth of the community contributing to the maintenance of the poverty trap.In this study we investigated the asymptomatic carriage of viral and bacterial enteric pathogens by adults in three traditional populations in remote regions of Papua New Guinea and searched for correlations between pathogen carriage and previously determined gut microbial community composition data.Stool samples were collected from participants in two highland regions of Papua New Guinea from February through March 2012 and one lowland site in September 2012 as outlined previously.Demographic data history of recent antibiotic use and dietary information were also collected as previously discussed.Participants were excluded from the study if they reported diarrhea or antibiotic use in the past 2 weeks before sample collection.Nucleic acids were extracted from stool samples using a modified phenolchlorophorm extraction methodand tested for a range of bacterial and viral enteric pathogens using previously published real-time PCRRT-PCR assays as out- lined in Soli et al..

In total enteric pathogens were detected in 41 N  61 of the participants.Significant differences were noted between highland com- munities versus lowland communities in the carriage rate of any pathogen P value  0.0001 viral pathogens P value  0.0001 and bacterial pathogens P value  0.0027  1.

This study suggests that enteric pathogens are common in healthy individuals in Papua New Guinean highland communities presumably acting as a reservoir of infection and thus contributing to a high burden of gastrointestinal illnesses.Gastrointestinal infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world particularly in children.In developing countries where the greatest burden of diarrheal mortalities occur gastrointestinal infections can also con- tribute to poor educational outcomes and reduced growth rates in children.In communities with poor access to sani- tation and safe water sources a cycle of individual infection followed by pathogen shedding into the environment through diarrhea or asymptomatic excretion potentially leads to dis- semination of infection in the community.

Analysis of the relationship between enteric pathogen carriage and microbial community composition of participants using box plots to compare specific normal flora population numbers did not suggest that gut microbial composition was directly associated with pathogen carriage.

are among the most common cause of diarrheal illnesses for both childrenand the general population.Indeed this patho- gen has also been linked with large mortality-associated outbreaks in displaced populations in this country.Because of the cross-sectional design of this study we cannot account for dynamic fluctuations in microbiota normal flora and enteric pathogen carriage.

in healthy controls.A study conducted in 399 healthy adults in Australia found no asymptomatic carriage of noroviruses in that population.To date there has been only one diarrheal etiology study in Papua New Guinea that included noroviruses in the testing.

Although the targeted PCR approachASYMPTOMATIC ENTERIC CARRIAGE IN PNG COMMUNITIES1875undertaken in our previous study is sufficiently sensitive to detect community differences it may be unable to detect subtle difference in community composition that may be present in carriage-positive participants compared with car- riage negative participants.Water hygiene and sanitation data were not collected as part of this study however it is conceivable that this was a factor.
