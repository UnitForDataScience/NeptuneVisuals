We hypothesized that the presence of C. difficile in the intestinal microbiota might possibly reflect the reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiota which is associated with an increased risk of allergic sensitization.

Therefore additional research of the association between the actual composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota and the development of FA should focus on the presence of C. difficile.The association between C. difficile colonization andor infec- tion and AR has not been reported previously.

Diagnosis of CDCI were confirmed when C. difficile was identified in the stool culture andor rapid immunoassay was positive for C. difficile toxins A and B.

For the C. difficile stool culture the collected stool was placed onto culture media of ChromID C. difficile agar BioMerieux SA and an anaerobic culture was conducted for 48 to 72 hours.

To identify the underlying mechanism further investigation and a larger cohort study will be needed.Key words Allergy Allergic diseases Clostridium difficile Gut microbiota Food allergyIntroductionThe intestinal microbiota is a key source of immune development and regulation early in life.

When the normal colonic microbiota is disrupted C. difficile can propagate and cause infection12.

The influence of C. difficile colonization andor infection CDCI during infancy after the settlement of normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract on allergic diseases during late childhood remains unknown.To determine the relationship between CDCI during infancyand the development of allergic diseases during childhood we hypothesized that CDCI during infancy could alter gut microbiota and increase the risk of development of allergic diseases during early childhood.Materials and methodsStudy design and populationInfants 1 to 12 months of age who were admitted to the pedi- atric gastrointestinal clinic at Gachon University Gil Medical Center between June 2009 and December 2012 were enrolled in this study.

The C. difficile-positive group included C. difficile colonization andor infection.

In a recent study of the association between altered commensal microbiota and food allergen sensitization the intestinal microbiota was found to regulate innate lymphoid cell function and intestinal epithelial permeability in mice and sensitization to food is regulated by these innate mechanisms20.
