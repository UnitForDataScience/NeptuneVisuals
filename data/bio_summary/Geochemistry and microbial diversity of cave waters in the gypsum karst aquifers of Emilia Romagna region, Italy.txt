PCR-DGGE profiles obtained for all samples in the years 2010-2011 I  March- April-May II  June-July-August III  September-October-November IV  December-January-February.associated to agricultural soil  taxonomically-re- lated to the species E. cloacae and also correlated to nitrate presence due to its high capacity of nitrate uptake .Nitrate concentration solid lines and total coliform distribution dots in sinking points blue colors and springs green colors from two big cave systems Rio Stella-Basino and Colombaia-Sempal are shown in .

The sinking stream waters with lower salinity and generally low nitrate values increase their TDS rapid- ly flowing through the caves toward the springs and some cave samples also increase their nitrate contents.

The mean nitrate values for the mon- itoring period 2010-2014 exceed the legal limit of 50 mgl in all Onferno samples from F01 to F04 and in the samples of the system Colombaia- Sempal from E10 to E11 and Befana E01 while C17 from Gaibola cave system only one time exceeds this value reaching 50.31 mgl dur- ing the winter 2013.

This microorganism is commonly characterized by nitrate reductase activity   and therefore could be directly related to nitrate-rich waters af- fected by anthropic activity.Table 3Correlations between total coliforms log UFCml - nitrate concentration NO- mgl and total coliforms log UFCml - ammonium concentration NH mgl in waters grouped by season.

E10 reaches total coliform values close to 4 autumn 2012 and 2.2-2.3 log UFCml autumn 2014 while E11 in autumn 2012 exceeds 4 log UFCml.In an overall view the high total coliform distribution in sinking streams E06-E10 might be linked to remobilization of by-products re- lated to human activities cattle raising agricultural crops sewage pipes while the high values in the spring points is probably related to the interaction between water and guano deposits inside the cave along the flow path.Also in Onferno Cave F01-04 there are high nitrate concentrations and microbial contamination mainly due to the presence of bat colonies .

These two systems have been analyzed in detail be- cause of their high nitrate concentrations revealed during the whole pe- riod of this LIFE project.The correlation between nitrates and total coliforms is evident only in a few periods and in particular when nitrate peaks are clearly visible.

The same samples have been ana- lyzed with traditional microbiology techniques focused on total microbial count and on fecal microbiota as index of human andor animal contamination and molecular biology techniques sequencing of 16S rRNA segment and PCR-DGGE focused on the characterization of microbial populations in the different sampling sites and deter- mination of their variations andor changes during the five years of the project.

The spring F04 shows values that commonly are lower than F03 as a normal behavior due to dilution pro- cesses and seem to be the sum of the other three components.From an overall view on all samples an evolution of the waters can easily be identified considering the concentration of nitrates and values of total dissolved solids TDS .

The authors correlated nitrate and oxidability to the total coliform counts as index of anthropic activities.

The results have revealed the rapid enrichment of the waters in total dissolved solids TDS mainly Ca and SO4 but also some local episodes of high nitrate and ammonium contents.
