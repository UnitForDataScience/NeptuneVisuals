Other such illnesses include gastrointestinal cancer   breast cancer  cirrhosis  and diabetes   .

Moreover in an independent validation using new saliva samples from 28 pancreatic cancer patients and 28 healthy controls only Neisseria elongata and Streptococcus mitis were useful in distinguishing patients with pancreatic cancer from healthy subjects with an area under the curve value of 0.90 95 CI 0.78-0.96 p  0.0001 a 96.4sensitivity and a 82.1 specificity .

Among bacteria the rela- tionships between Neisseria Streptococcus and Porphyromonas and lung cancer have been established along with clearly significant associations between salivary Capnocytophaga and Veillonella and lung cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma .Host sideThe normal healthy state of the oral mucosal cavity is a state of balance between various organisms and the host.
