the orfs related to lignocellulose degradation including 821 orfs for ces and pls 816 orfs for cellulases and 2252 orfs for hemicellulases 18 were used for assess- ment of cellulolytic bacteria as described in the following section.taxonomic assignmentin previous study 18 a classified group of 39579 orfs was obtained from comparison of 164644 orfs from the meta- genomic data of bacteria in goats' rumen against the ncbi non-redundant protein nr database using the blastx algorithm with an e-value of less than 10-5. in this study the orfs were subjected to the metagenome analyzer program megan version 4.6 19 for taxonomic assignment intoncbi taxonomy using lowest common ancestor lca algo- rithm.

we also used the ratio of firmicutes bacteroidetes to assess the bacterial structure in our goats' rumen in comparison with the ratio in other bacterial con- sortia in different animal rumens in previous studies.analysis of bacteria harbouring lignocellulolytic genes in vietnamese goats' rumenfrom 821 orfs encoding ces and pls involved in lignocel- lulose pretreatment 816 orfs encoding cellulases 2252 orfs encoding for hemicellulases had been annotated from 164644 orfs 18 we filtered all these orfs accompanied with the corresponding gene codes and functional annota- tion to a new file.

analysis in genus level 398 orfs were affiliated to provotella 300 orfs were belonged to bacteroides 39 orfs were predicted to be derived from paraprevotella 39 orfs were originated from ruminococcus.

the most cellulase orfs were affiliated to bacteroidetes153 orfs 69.2 followed by firmicutes 53 orfs 24.0 and then proteobacteria 7 orfs figure 2a.

within this group the most abundant phylum was again bacteroidetes with 500 orfs accounting for 91.9 followed by firmicutes 27 orfs and then by proteobacteia 7 orfs figure 2a.

the 56 orfs encoding ce1 were affiliated to many bacteria orders such as bacteroidetes firmicutes planctomycetes spirochaetes while ce1 domains collocated with a carbohydrate binding domain cbm cbm48 10 orfs were only assigned to bacteroidetes.

this pattern was similar for ce6 and pl1 ce6 21 orfs which were pre- dicted to be produced in bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia while pl1 45 orfs could be linked to bacteroidetes and firmicutes.

as a result among 816 orfs genes for cellulases 2252 orfs for hemicellulases and 821 orfs encoding enzymes involved in lignocelluloses pretreatment that were annotated by different databases 18 221 genes for cellulases 544 genes for hemi- cellulases and 226 genes for lignocellulose pretreatment were affiliated by ncbi taxonomic classification.

for pretreatment enzymes cesand pls the most abundant phylum is again bacteroidetes 201 orfs followed by firmicutes 14 orfs figure 2a.

analysis of 9 gb metagenome of bacteria in the goats' rumen five co and five bach thao animals se-quenced by illumina technology resulted in 172981 contigs and predicted 164644 open reading frames orfs of which 122304 orfs were annotated.

thus all orfs represented in gene code in the classified group were assigned in the detail in every taxon.analysis of overall bacterial community structure in vietnamese goats' rumenfrom 39579 orfs classified in megan we separated the taxon level kingdom phylum class order family genus spe- cies in separated files.

specially aerophaga was predicted to harbour orfs for only hemicellulase 7 orfswhile algoriphagus was predicted to carry orfs for only ces and pls.when we analysed specific classes of lignocellulolytic genes we observed divergent patterns of taxonomic distribution de- pending on enzyme function.

according to functional annotation results speculated by swiss-prot kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes non-supervised orthologous groups cluster of orthologous groups and carbohydrate-active enzymes databases the absolute amount and diversity of hemicellulases 2252 genes lignocellulose pretreatment enzymes 821 orfs and carbohydrate binding modules cbms 763 genes were much higher in our data18 when compared to a study in korean goat rumen 4. we hypothesize that i the vietnamese diet is the main driver of this diversification apart from the host genotype ii ratio be- tween firmicutes and bacteroidetes is an important indicator to assess the effectuality of lignocellulose degradation a lower ratio indicates the presence of more diverse lignocellulolytic gh enzymes originating from bacteroidetes.materials and methodsanimal carethe animal experimental protocol of this research was re- viewed discussed and approved by the institutional ethics committee of the institute of genome research institutional review board igr irb vietnam approval number no.

further analysis showed that within bacteroidetes phylum the most abundant order was bacteroidales 60.8. the most represented order within the firmicutes phylum was clostridiales 16.4 followed by selenomonadales 2.8 figure 1. synergistales--a unique member of synergistetes phylum represented about 3.1 of the taxonomic classified orfs and aeromonadales--a mem- ber of proteobacteria were also abundant in this data.
