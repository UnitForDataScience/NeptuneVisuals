Characterization of the exercise-induced bacterial phylotypes indicated an increase in bacteria likely capable of degrading resistant polysaccharides and an increase in short chain fatty acid producers.Conclusions While a significant effect of exercise on microbiota composition occurred in SC-fed rats the HF-fed rats microbiota showed little response.

Microbial communities from rats fed a SC diet were highly differentiated based on activity inter- vention with the HIIT.SC group rats having the highest similarity in microbiota between rats within the same group but distinct to other activity groups.

Although links between physical activity diet and gut microbiota have been recognized previous studies have not compared the effect of different activity typesintensities and diets on gut microbiota which may be important in better understanding how changes to activity and diet can influence health via gut microbiota.

Although diets were named simi- larly as high fat and low fat SC they were not compara- ble based on composition and this would strongly influence microbiota responses for each treatment as would differences in starting microbiota composition.Our study identified a number of bacteria that charac- terize microbiota shifts in response to training.

Therefore it can be suggested that using rats for microbiota studies appropriately models microbiota interactions in humans.In a recent study Petriz et al.

In rats fed SC significant differences in intestinal microbiota were evident between exercised and nonexercised rats.

This study aimed to investigate the ability of exercise to re-shape the intestinal microbiota and the influence of the diet on the process.Methods and Results A rat model was used to examine the intestinal microbiota responses to four activity conditions including high-intensity interval training HIIT light-intensity training LIT sedentary and normal control each containing two nutritional conditions high-fat high-fructose diet HF and standard chow SC diet.
