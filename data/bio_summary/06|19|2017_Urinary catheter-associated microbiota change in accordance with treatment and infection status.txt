Patient 2 had the highestrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae 85 followed by Patient 3 58 and then Patient 111.Inter-patient variation in microbial communitiesTo examine differences in urinary tract microbiota between patients T-RFLP and sequencing data were compared.

The difference between communities was especially clear for the sequence based data where the communities segregated into two distinct groups based on treatment Months 3 and 5 samples on the left in  or no treatment samples on theThe microbial community composition from Patient 2 during and after probiotic treatment.

While there was a trend of patientshaving distinct microbiomes based on the community sequencing data Patients 2 and 3 were more similar to each other than to Patient 1 which was the most different from the other two patients.To compare the communities between patients Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were calculated for the microbial community of each patient based on the Illumina sequence data .

The microbial flora for Patient 1 Blue triangles Patient 2 Red circles and Patient 3 Grey squares were plotted for each time point collected.

Six samples were collected from the post-treatmentShannon diversity indices of the three patients at the genus level from meta-sequencing data.The microbial community composition from Patient 1 during and after probiotic treatment.

MDS plot of the microbial flora from Patient 1 based on T-RFLP B and Illumina sequencing data C. The green triangles represent samples collected from October 2011 to March 2012 corresponding to Months 1 3 and 6 of probiotic treatment.

This pre-UTI sample segregates from samples col- lected at non-UTI time points suggesting that there was a disturbance in the microbial com- munity associated with the onset of symptomatic infection.Community sequence data was examined for further investigation of the differences in communities between the samples collected at different time points in particular changes in types and relative abundances of OTUs at the genus level.

MDS plot of the microbial flora from Patient 2 during and after probiotic treatment based on T-RFLP B and Illumina sequencing data C. The four green triangles represent the samples collected during the probiotic interventional period between November 2012 and April 2013 with November being the baseline time point examined.

This was especially clear for the 16S sequence data where the communities segregated into twodistinct groups based on treatment green triangles on the right in  or no treatment samples on the left in .To further understand the differences in communities between the samples collected at dif- ferent time points the community sequence data were examined based on changes in OTUs at the genus level for each time point.

Based on these results we propose that monitoring a patient's microbial community can be used to track the health of chronically catheterized patients and thus can be used as part of a health-status monitoring program.data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.IntroductionCatheterised patients particularly those with spinal cord injuries SCI are highly susceptible to microbial colonization and hence are at increased risk of symptomatic infection -.
