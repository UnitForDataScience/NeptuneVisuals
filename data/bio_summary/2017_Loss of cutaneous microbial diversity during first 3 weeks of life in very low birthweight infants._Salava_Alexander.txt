The changes can be illustrated with or- dination plots Figures 4 and S3 where most samples from the 1st week of life cluster on the left and contain more Probionibacterium and samples from weeks 2-4 on the right with more Staphylococcus with samples from week 5 onwards falling between these extremes.Five of the 12 infants nos.

The samples on day 1 were taken in the NICU after transfer from the delivery room and after administration of the standard initial antibiotics.

The characteristics of the early days 1-8 cutaneous microbi- ome in healthy neonates have been described in a recent study.16Important factors that might influence the microbiome are imma- turity of the neonatal skin systemic antibiotic treatment in the NICU all neonates received the same primary antibiotics or environmental factors intensive care ward incubator mothers' skin.
