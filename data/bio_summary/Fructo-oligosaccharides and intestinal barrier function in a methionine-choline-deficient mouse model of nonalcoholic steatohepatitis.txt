villus heights were significantly higher in mcd  fos mice 221.9 - 8.6 mm than in control 192.1 - 10.9 mm and mcd mice 140.9 - 25.2 mm p  0.01. length of the small intestine was longer in mcd fos mice 33.7 - 5.6 mm than in control 30.1 - 4.5 mm and mcd mice 23.0 - 2.7 mm p  0.01. length of the small intestine was also longer in mcd  fos mice 7.0 - 3.9 mm than in mcd mice 5.1 - 2.5 mm p  0.02 but not significantly different from that inmcd-fed mice with or without fos treatment.

although mcd  fos mice had a similar weight as that of mcd mice 19.7 - 1.1 g p  0.3 cecal length was longer in mcd  fos mice than in mcd mice 31.8 - 0.1 mm p  0.003. when we performed iga staining of the cecal patch to investigate the iga-producing cells we observed iga-positive cells in the follicle and germinal center of control and mcd  fos mice which we hardly observed in mcd mice .

the number of total kupffer cells was 984.7 - 146.8 in control mice versus 3426.5 - 663.3 in mcd mice p  0.003 and 2612.2 - 452.5 in mcd  fos mice p  0.07. cd14 kupffer cell counts were 81.2 - 27.2 in control mice versus 1335.7 - 454.7 in mcd mice p  0.001 and 383.3 - 101.4 in mcd  fos mice p  0.002 .

the nas in mcd mice liver revealed scores of 2.3 - 0.4 1.8 - 0.3 and 1.3 - 0.4 points for steatosis centrilobular hepatitis and ballooning degeneration respectively whereas the value for each category was significantly decreased by 0.5 - 0.5 points in mcd  fos mice steatosis p  0.003 centrilobular hepatitis p  0.005 ballooning degeneration p  0.03 .

it was recognized that the iga concentration in feces was 1.3 - 0.1 mgg in control mice compared to- 0.1 mgg in mcd mice p  0.01  and 1.7 - 0.1 mgg in mcd  fos mice p  0.003.mcd mice exhibited significant weight loss 18.8 - 1.2 g vs. control's 28.0 - 1.3 g p  0.003 and shortening of cecal length 14.3 - 0.1 mm vs. control's 26.8 - 0.1 mmp  0.004 .

methionine-choline-deficient mice given 5 fructo-oligosaccharides exhibited significantly decreased hepatic steatosis p  0.003 decreased liver inflammation p  0.005 a decreased proportion of cd14-posi- tive kupffer cells p  0.01 decreased expression of tlr4 p  0.04 and increases in fecal short-chain fatty acid and iga concentrations p  0.04 compared with the findings in methi- onine-choline-deficient mice that were not administered this prebiotic.

in the ileal tissue there were more iga-positive cells in mcd  fos mice 155.2 - 8.7 cells than in control 121.2 - 10.9 cells and mcd mice 98.4 - 15.0 cells p  0.001. it was similar in the colonic tissue there were more iga-positive cells in mcd  fos mice 89.1 - 13.3 cells than inflow cytometric analysis of f480 cd11b kupffer cells in the livers of mcd-fed mice with or without fos treatment.

the mfi ratio of tlr4 in cd14 kupffer cells was 7.8 - 0.5 in control mice compared to 10.6 - 0.1 in mcd mice p  0.04 and 8.5 - 0.2 in mcd  fos mice p  0.04 .analysis of short-chain fatty acids in feceswe hypothesized that mcd-mediated attenuation of intestinal barrier function was due to a reduction of lactobacillales-produced short-chain fatty acids.

p  0.05.acid 0.1 - 0.1 mgg vs. control's 0.4 - 0.1 mgg p  0.002 and n-butyric acid 0.1 - 0.1 mg g vs. control's 0.6 - 0.1 mgg p  0.003 were significantly decreased in mcd mice .

in mcd  fos mice the concentrations of acetic acid 0.9 - 0.3 mgg p  0.04 and propionic acid 0.2 - 0.1 mgg p  0.001 were significantly improved whereas that of n-butyric acid 0.6 - 0.1 mgg p  0.002 was improved to control levels.analysis of iga-producing processwe hypothesized that mcd-mediated attenuation of intestinal barrier function would include not only disruption of tight junctions but also that of mucosal immunity due reduced iga pro- duction.

meanwhile serum alt levels 37.7 - 7.3ul were significantly lower in mcd  fos mice than in mcd mice p  0.0005 and the liver was brownish as observed in control mice.

thus we mea- sured total and cd14 kupffer cell numbers and mfi ratio of tlr4 using flow cytometry.the ratio of cd14 cells among f480 cd11b kupffer cells was 8.1 - 1.7 in control mice versus 37.6 - 6.7 in mcd mice p  0.01 and 14.5 - 2.8 in mcd  fos micep  0.01 .

the number of cd19 cells in the cecal patch showed no difference in each group  but cd38 a b cell activation marker was expressed more in mcd  fos mice 2.5 - 0.2 than in mcd mice 1.7 - 0.3 p  0.02.fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations of mcd-fed mice with or without fos treatment.
