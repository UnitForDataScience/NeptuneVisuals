Although MCD  FOS mice had a similar weight as that of MCD mice 19.7 - 1.1 g p  0.3 cecal length was longer in MCD  FOS mice than in MCD mice 31.8 - 0.1 mm p  0.003.

The NAS in MCD mice liver revealed scores of 2.3 - 0.4 1.8 - 0.3 and 1.3 - 0.4 points for steatosis centrilobular hepatitis and ballooning degeneration respectively whereas the value for each category was significantly decreased by 0.5 - 0.5 points in MCD  FOS mice steatosis p  0.003 centrilobular hepatitis p  0.005 ballooning degeneration p  0.03 .

It was recognized that the IgA concentration in feces was 1.3 - 0.1 mgg in control mice compared to- 0.1 mgg in MCD mice p  0.01  and 1.7 - 0.1 mgg in MCD  FOS mice p  0.003.MCD mice exhibited significant weight loss 18.8 - 1.2 g vs. Control's 28.0 - 1.3 g p  0.003 and shortening of cecal length 14.3 - 0.1 mm vs. Control's 26.8 - 0.1 mmp  0.004 .

Methionine-choline-deficient mice given 5 fructo-oligosaccharides exhibited significantly decreased hepatic steatosis p  0.003 decreased liver inflammation p  0.005 a decreased proportion of CD14-posi- tive Kupffer cells p  0.01 decreased expression of TLR4 p  0.04 and increases in fecal short-chain fatty acid and IgA concentrations p  0.04 compared with the findings in methi- onine-choline-deficient mice that were not administered this prebiotic.

The number of total Kupffer cells was 984.7 - 146.8 in control mice versus 3426.5 - 663.3 in MCD mice p  0.003 and 2612.2 - 452.5 in MCD  FOS mice p  0.07.

CD14 Kupffer cell counts were 81.2 - 27.2 in control mice versus 1335.7 - 454.7 in MCD mice p  0.001 and 383.3 - 101.4 in MCD  FOS mice p  0.002 .

The MFI ratio of TLR4 in CD14 Kupffer cells was 7.8 - 0.5 in control mice compared to 10.6 - 0.1 in MCD mice p  0.04 and 8.5 - 0.2 in MCD  FOS mice p  0.04 .Analysis of short-chain fatty acids in fecesWe hypothesized that MCD-mediated attenuation of intestinal barrier function was due to a reduction of Lactobacillales-produced short-chain fatty acids.

p  0.05.acid 0.1 - 0.1 mgg vs. Control's 0.4 - 0.1 mgg p  0.002 and n-butyric acid 0.1 - 0.1 mg g vs. Control's 0.6 - 0.1 mgg p  0.003 were significantly decreased in MCD mice .

In MCD  FOS mice the concentrations of acetic acid 0.9 - 0.3 mgg p  0.04 and propionic acid 0.2 - 0.1 mgg p  0.001 were significantly improved whereas that of n-butyric acid 0.6 - 0.1 mgg p  0.002 was improved to control levels.Analysis of IgA-producing processWe hypothesized that MCD-mediated attenuation of intestinal barrier function would include not only disruption of tight junctions but also that of mucosal immunity due reduced IgA pro- duction.

Meanwhile serum ALT levels 37.7 - 7.3Ul were significantly lower in MCD  FOS mice than in MCD mice p  0.0005 and the liver was brownish as observed in control mice.
