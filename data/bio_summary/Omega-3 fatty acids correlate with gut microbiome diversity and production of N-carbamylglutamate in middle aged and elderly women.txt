Such reports suggest an interaction between microbiome composition and intake of omega-3 fatty acids but a close examination of the links between omega-3 circulating levels and detailed micro- biome composition in non-infant cohorts has not been explored to date.Bacterial species including those forming the human gut microbiome are not well defined and bacterial genomes are highly variable.

The resulting taxonomic groupings are known as Operational Taxonomic Units OTUs and are used consistently within the same experiment.The aim of this study is to assess the association between omega-3 fatty acids serum levels and intake with microbiome composition diversity and with specific OTUs.ResultsWe analysed data from 876 female twins with 16 s microbiome data and circulating levels of fatty acids includ- ing DHA total omega-3 fatty acids FAW3 182 linolenic acid LNA total omega-6 fatty acids FAW6 total PUFA and for comparison we also tested monounsaturated fatty acids 161 181 MUFA total saturated fatty acids SFA and total fatty acids TotFA measured at the same time point using the Brainshake NMR platform.

The association remains significant after adjustment for DHA however some of the DHA associations with these OTUs are attenuated when adjusting for NCG levels Table  suggesting that the correlation between the abundances some of these OTUs and DHA serum levels could be mediated by NCG faecal concentrations.DiscussionIn this study we show in a population based cohort of middle aged and elderly women that circulating levels of omega-3 fatty acids are associated with higher microbiome diversity and with a higher abundance of OTUs belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family.Omega-3 levels in humans are determined by dietary intake and by conversion of alpha-linolenic acid ALA to DHA.

Analysis of gut microbiota and faecal transfer in mice has revealed that elevated tissue omega-3 fatty acids enhance intestinal production and secretion of intestinal alkaline phosphatase which induces changes in the gut bacteria composition resulting in decreased lipopolysaccharide production and gut permeability and ultimately reduced metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation.A recent randomized controlled clinical trial in an Indian population has shown that supplementation with omega 3 plus a probiotic has a greater beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity lipid profile and atherogenic index than the probiotic alone although omega-3 supplementation showed only marginal effects on all the param- eters.

Higher gut microbiome diversity is linked to lower inflam- mation  thus our data reinforce the notion that omega-3 fatty acids are linked to lower gut inflammation.We also identified 38 OTUs associated with circulating levels of DHA.

1044 samples used in the present study the final read depth was 80865 - 35718 mean-SD.The demographic characteristics of the study population are presented in Table .The serum circulating levels of the polyunsaturated fatty acids FAW3 FAW6 LNA and DHA reflect in part the intake levels we observe a significant correlation between dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake estimates from FFQs and serum levels of FAW3 r  0.168 p 2.64 x 10-7.Omega-3 and omega-6 associate with microbiome diversity.

The study is one of the very few to investigate the link between microbiome associations and the faecal metabolome.In conclusion our data indicate a strong correlation between omega-3 fatty acids and microbiome com- position and suggest that supplementation with PUFAs may be considered along with prebiotic and probiotic supplementation aimed at improving the microbiome composition and diversity.

On the other hand it is well known that omega-3 circulating levels are reflective of dietary intakeand although the associations we find with esti- mates of omega-3 dietary intake are weaker than with serum levels this is likely to simply reflect the error of accu- rate estimates of intake from food questionnaire data compared to the accuracy of serum level measurements.

As dietary fibre intake positively correlates with the gut microbiome we also ran the analysis adjusting for fibre intake and the results remained consistent Supplementary Table .In our data we calculated an estimate of microbial beta-diversity using both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distancesas implemented in QIIMEand used principal coordinate analysis to examine its associations with omega-3 circulating levels but did not find significant patterns data not shown.

They are also known as potent short-chain fatty acid producers On the other hand we also find members of the Ruminococcaceae associated with increased levels of DHA and subtypes of some of this family have been implicated in obesity.The anti-inflammatory benefits of omega-3 PUFAs on gut microbiome composition may be attributed to the products of DHA metabolism in particular those resulting from endogenous lipoxygenase-catalyzed hydroxy- lation of DHA which in turn produces resolvins and protectin D1 through acetylation of the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme.
