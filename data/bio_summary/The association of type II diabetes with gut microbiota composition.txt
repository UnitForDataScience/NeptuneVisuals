Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the gut bacterial composition in patients with T2D was partially different from that in the healthy individuals.

Accordingly this study was designed to investigate the relationship between these specific bacteria and T2D by comparing the changes in gut bacterial compositions in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals.

Our study focused on the bacterial compositional changes in T2D adult patients and indicated that gut microbial composition was different between the patient subjects and healthy group by qPCR analysis.

These studies indicated that composition of dominant bacteria in gut microbiota of T2D subjects is different in comparison with that of healthy individuals .

These results are consistent with previous research in which lower F. prausnitziiamounts was reported in patient subjects compared to healthy controls e. As noted T2D is associated with changes in the balance of gut microbiota rather than the action of a single microbe or a simple enhancement in diversity.

It was demonstrated that composition of gut microbiota may be directly 0882-4010c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.responsible for inducing a low-grade inflammatory state closely associated with T2D disorder .

More investigations are needed to clarify the correct process of the changes in intestinal bacteria associated with the progression of T2D as well as the changes in lifestyle and obtain a more detailed understanding of the role of gut bacterial composition in the disease state.ConclusionReal-time PCR analysis illustrates that despite the non- significant difference in Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium longum fecal concentration of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was significantly lower in patients with type 2 diabetes than normal group.

Confirming the association of gut microbiome composi- tion with metabolic diseases such as T2D could potentially help usto restore intestinal microflora to a normal status by administering suitable prebiotics and probiotics as well as modification of lifestyle and diet.Authors' contributionMS and SR contributed to the conception and design of the work the acquisition analysis and interpretation of data for the work.
