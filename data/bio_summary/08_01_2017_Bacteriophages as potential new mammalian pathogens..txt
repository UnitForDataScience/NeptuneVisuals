However this was not the goal of our study since bacteriophages are known to specifically target specific bacterial species and therefore other types of phages may lead to different microbiota alterations and consequences for the macroorganism.The experimental model used allows to minimize possible direct effect of used phages on mammalian intesti- nal epithelium as there are numerous of available receptors of specific bacteriophage receptors on the surface of the bacteria of rats' microbiota.Collectively our results warrant further research on microbiota diseases and previously underestimated conse- quences related to bacteriophage exposure in mammals including humans.

Using a rat model we examined the effects of exposure to a bacteriophage cocktail on intestinal permeability and relative abundance of taxonomic units in the gut bacterial community.

There was an increase in markers of impaired gut permeability such as the lactulosemannitol ratio plasma endotoxin concentrations and serum levels of inflammation- related cytokines following the bacteriophage challenge.

We observed significant differences in the alpha diversity of faecal bacterial species and found that richness and diversity index valuesincreased following the bacteriophage challenge.

There was a reduction in the abundance of Blautia Catenibacterium Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium species and an increase in Butyrivibrio Oscillospira and Ruminococcus after bacteriophage administration.

To investigate these issues we carried out Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene to compare the microbiota composition before and after a bacteriophage challenge and to uncover its role in the increased intestinal permeability and endotoxemia in rats.

This information can provide a basis for the crucial next step in the evaluation of bacteriophage implications in poorly treatable human diseases.ResultsBacteriophages increase gut permeability and mediate endotoxemia.

We examined gut permeability function in animals before and 10 days after the daily challenge with a bacteriophage cocktail using each animal as its own control.All animals survived the entire duration of the experiment with no clinical changes in the gastrointestinal tract or stool alteration.

We did not detect statistically significant differences in the total weight at baseline and after bacteriophage treatment however a trend towards weight loss was registered.

After bacteriophage administration the average weight of each rat was 231 - 45 compared with 269 - 28 g in the pre-treatment period.
