the microbial colonization is disrupted in preterm infants because of gi tract immaturity the use of antibiotics compromised nutrition and extended hospital stay.16 in this case the microbiota of preterm infants is characterized by higher levels of potentially pathogenic bacteria and lower amounts of beneficial bifidobacterium and bacteroides than that of full-term newborns.1617the method of delivery has been shown to be the primary factor of a newborn's intestinal microbiota composition.18 vaginal deliveries provide infants higher numbers of beneficial lactobacillus bifidobacterium and bacteroides fragilis and higher amounts of clostridium microbiota as compared with infants born through cesarean deliveries.1819 present studies indicate that cesarean-born infants develop an intestinal microbiota with atypical short-term immune responses and an increased long-term risk of developing immune diseases.19-21 although it is still unclear whether or not cesarean birth influences ensuing mental health it has been established that this type of birth increases the incidence of obesity.21dietary considerations are another significant factor that has a direct impact on establishing a healthy neonatal gut microbiota.1315 it is well established that breast-feeding offers the best source of nutrition for the growth and maturation of the infant intestinal microbiome.22 breast milk is composed of a complex mixture of oligosaccharides that are known to stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium that exerts a positive impact on the immune system while inhibits the binding of pathogenic bacteria.22 although breast milk feeding provides the best nutrition for the colonization of a beneficial microbiota the transition to a healthy solid food source during weaning is essential for the development of a more complex stable microbiotaprofile characteristic of the adult gi tract.13 it is during this transition period of weaning to a solid food diet where the most highly adapted bacteroidetes and firmicutes bacteria increase in numbers laying the foundation for the adult gut microbiome.13 bacterial diversity continues to increase as the child ages as a result of nutrition intake and environmental exposure and after 1 year of age a complex adult microbiome is established.2325adult microbiota ecosystemthe characteristic ecosystem found in the adult intestines includes the bacteroidetes and firmicutes phyla proteobacteria and anaerobic bacteria such as bifidobacterium species.2425 in addition oxygen- tolerant lactobacillus spp are present in fluctuating numbers largely dependent on diet and environmental factors.26 although the adult microflora is individual with specific variability in the enteric microbiota it is the homeostasis within the microbiome that confers health benefits an imbalance of beneficial bacteria can negatively impact the health and well-being of the individual.27 it is clearly evident that the quality and balance of the microbiota differ markedly among those who age with good health and those whose health declines with age.27microbiota in the older adultsas the human organ systems undergo the process of aging serious alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota become increasingly apparent.

furthermore accompanying immunosenescence is a chroniclow-grade systemic inflammatory state that creates a favorable environment for the growth of pathobionts over symbiont bacteria.29although the composition of intestinal microbiota in the older adults is extremely variable among individuals in general the biodiversity is reduced and the stability is compromised.30 studies indicate variations in gut microbiota composition among different nationalities that have been attributed tocorresponding differences in lifestyle and characteristic diet types.30 these results reinforce thereferencesmicrobiota-gut-brain axis part 1135significant impact of nutrition on microbiota composition.27 all indications point to the fact that a healthy diverse diet promotes a more diverse gut microbiota composition that in turn is greatly beneficial to the health and well-being of the older adults.microbiota-gut-brain axisrole in health and diseasea bidirectional signaling exists between the metabolically complex intestinal microbiota the gut and the brain.

the colonization of bacteria in the intestines of the infant begins during birth when delivery exposes the infant to a complex microbiota133134holistic nursing practice  marchapril 2017which is critical for maturation of the immune system.13 it is in this early stage of life where the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota is believed to have profound consequences on the futurewell-being of the individual.14 this initial phase of microbiota development is largely determined by the type of bacteria the infant is exposed to during the process of delivery and after the first few hours of life with the maternal microbiome as its first inscription through vagina the anal area and the skin.15there are several variables that are known to affect the composition of infant gut microbiota including the method of delivery the manner of feeding the duration of gestation internal and external stressors and the use of antibiotics and probiotics.

natural physiological changes including digestive problems and decreased intestinal motility can lead to an imbalanced dietary intake and malabsorption of nutrients which ultimately compromise the intestinal microbiota composition in the older adults 65 years of age.28 another process that negatively affects the homeostatic equilibrium of the gut microbiota in the older adults is a decline in functionality of the immune system immunosenescence.

alterations in the bidirectional signaling of the microbiota-gut-brain triad have been linked in the pathogenesis of brain-gut disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease and the manifestation of obesity and type 2 diabetes.31-33 recent studies have implicated an imbalance of normal gut microbiota in the pathology of several brain disorders including autism spectrum disorders1 mood disorders1 and immune function.33 in addition intestinal microbiota and its metabolites have been shown to be involved in modulating mood and behavior stress responses and brain biochemistry.summarythe intestinal microbiota evolves from birth changing from an immature state during infancy to a more complex and diverse ecosystem in adulthood and plays a pivotal role in both health and disease.disequilibrium of its homeostatic state has been shown to precipitate negative consequences on host health leading to gi immunological and neurological disorders.

recent research has emerged that suggests potential therapeutic approaches to modulate and stabilize the gut microbiota and to restore its healthy composition from dysbiotic states in various conditions such as mood disorders obesity and type 2 diabetes.cryan jf dinan tg.
