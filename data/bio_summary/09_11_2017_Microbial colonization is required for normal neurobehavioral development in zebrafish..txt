Conventionally colonized axenic and axenic larvae colonized at 1 day post fertilization dpf were evaluated using a standard locomotor assay.

Colonization of axenic embryos at 1 dpf with individual bacterial species Aeromonas veronii or Vibrio cholerae was sufficient to block locomotor hyperactivity at 10 dpf.Exposure to heat-killed bacteria or microbe-associated molecular patterns pam3CSK4 or PolyIC was not sufficient to block hyperactivity in axenic larvae.

Compared to mammals it is relatively simple to generate microbe-free axenic zebrafish and axenic zebrafish subsequently colonized with diverse zebrafish facil- ity microbes or single strains of microbes-and to administer probiotics to conventionally colonized fish .

To examine whether micro- biota modify neurobehavioral activity during development we generated axenic larvae axenic larvae conven- tionalized on 1 dpf with zebrafish facility microbes or conventionally colonized larvae Table and Fig.

To determine whether there is a timing requirement for microbial colonization to affect locomotor responses we tested the effect of conventionalization of axenic larvae on different days of development where axenic larvae were colonized on 1 3 6 or 9 dpf and then evaluated on 10 dpf Fig.

Here we report hyperactivity as measured by the distance moved following a light-to-dark transition in axenic larvae at 10 dpf relative to axenic larvae colonized on day 1 or conventionally colonized controls.

Despite temporal differences in the appearance of the hyperac- tivity phenotype increased activity in axenic larvae reported in the current study and in Davis et al.recapitulates findings in mice using the open field test in which axenic mice move more relative to specific-pathogen-free conventionalized controls .In mouse models microbiota appear to have a role in normal stress responsivity anxiety-like behaviors socia- bility and cognition reviewed in refs and .

For example several studies have reported a reduction in basal levels of anxiety-like behavior in axenic mice-  while other studies report no change in anxiety-like behavior in axenic mice .

In the current study we did not observe differences in thigmotaxic behavior in axenic larvae and axenic larvae colonized on day 1 at 6 or 10 dpf nor did we observe differences in the initial 10 sec startle response following onset of the dark period.

showed decreased thigmotaxis in 6 dpf axenic larvae as compared to axenic larvae colonized on day 1 or conventionally colonized controls.
