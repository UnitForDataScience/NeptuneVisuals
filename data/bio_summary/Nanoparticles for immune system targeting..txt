Most NP studies have focused on altering T cell responses such as T cell infiltration  T cell expansion to tumor sites  T cell activation  and T cell numbers .Drug Discovery Today  Volume 22 Number 9  September 2017REVIEWSHunsawong et al.

The crosstalk between B cells and T cells widens the potential of utilizing NPs as vaccine adju- vants or vaccines.Nanoparticles targeting T cells T cells are lymphocytes that express T cell receptors TCR on their surface and serve essential roles in cell-mediated immunity.

The most common T cell types are Th also known as CD4 T cells and cytotoxic T cells also known as CD8 T cells.

Other studies have examined subgroup T cell responses and we discuss those studies below.Nanoparticles targeting CD4 T cellsHere we summarize some of the latest studies examining the effects of NPs on CD4 T cells.

Therefore CD8 T cell responses are generally more difficult to trigger by using NPs and can require multiplexed targeting moieties for efficiently delivering antigens into the cells.In summary T cells can be targeted by various means through NP-assisted therapies some of which boost a CD4 or CD8 T cell response whereas others modulate a Treg response.

Both naive B cells and T cells are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow active B cells have a major role in humoral immune responses whereas active T cells determine cell-mediated immune responses.

Exogenous antigens are usually displayed on MHC-I molecules which activate CD8 T cells whereas MHC-II molecules activate CD4 T cells.

NPs activate the maturation of T cells and B cells either indirectly through uptake by antigen-presenting cells APCs or directly by targeting surface receptors on T cells and B cells.

Differentiation of T cells particularly CD4 T cells is dictated by various stimulation signals including cytokines.

MHC-II molecules which are presented by APCs activate CD4 T cells whereas MHC-I molecules activate CD8 T cells .
