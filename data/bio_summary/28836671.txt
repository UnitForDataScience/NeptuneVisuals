however as most of these species are uncultivable and many strains need to be identified con- temporaneously to determine statistical significance over the course of a year a metagenomic approach seems a judicious alternative to culture-based bacteriological methods.ref e re nce sbatista f. m. lopez-sanmartin m. grade a. morgado i. valente m. navas j. i.

although the determinants of these microbial dynamics have not yet been identified they may be con- sidered as a sign of general declining health in cultured bivalves.the pathogenicity of vibrio aestuarianus for the oyster has been demonstrated in previous studies labreuche et al.

here we addressed the problem of bacterial diseases in an italian aquaculture production area where vibrio aestuarianus appears to be a serious pathogen that may threaten local oyster production.
