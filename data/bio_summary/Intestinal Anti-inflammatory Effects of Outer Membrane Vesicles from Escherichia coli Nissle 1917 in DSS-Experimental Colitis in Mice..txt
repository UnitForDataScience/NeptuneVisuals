Thus OMVs as a non-replicative bacterial form could be explored as a new probiotic-derived therapeutic approach with even lower risk of adverse events than probiotic administration.Keywords probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 outer membrane vesicles DSS-experimental colitis mouse model immune modulationAbbreviations Cox-2 cyclooxygenase 2 DAI disease activity index DSS dextran sodium sulfate EcN Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 GAPDH glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hBD-2 human b-defensin IBD inflammatory bowel diseases iNOS inducible nitric oxide synthase LB Luria-Bertani broth LPS lipopolysaccharide MIP-2 macrophage inflammatory protein 2 MMPs matrix metalloproteinases NO nitric oxide OMVs outer membrane vesicles PAGE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PBMCs peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBS phosphate buffered saline PRRs pattern-recognition receptors SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate TEM transmission electron microscopy TFF-3 trefoil factor 3 TJ tight junction TLRs toll-like receptors TNF-a tumor necrosis factor-a Treg regulatory T cells UC ulcerative colitis ZO-1 zonula occludens-1.INTRODUCTIONThe term IBD mainly refers to UC and Crohn's disease.

In fact colon length is inversely associated with the severity of DSS-induced colitis   and the colonic weightlength ratio is widely used as an indicator of the colonic oedema that typically occurs in experimental colitis .

Consequently the effects exerted by EcN OMVs on the altered expression of MMPs during colitis can contribute to their ability to protect against tissue damage induced by DSS.In addition RT-qPCR analysis was performed for the inflammatory enzymes COX-2 and inducible iNOS known to be upregulated in DSS-induced colitis.
