Table The Nit1000 primer consistently failed to detect any Nitrobacter in the latter operational phases and in samples that were detected with Nitro- bacter the relative abundance was more than 2-fold lower than that detected by the Nit1017 primer.Validation of HOPE dataset obtained for trickling biofilm reactor with 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing Based on the HOPE primer coverage shown in Additional file the relative abundance of genera Nitrosomonas Nitrosospira Nitrobacter and Nitrospira obtained by 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing was respectively compared against the relative abundance detected by Nse1472 Nitrosomonas Nsv443 Nitrosospira Nit1000 or Nit1017 Nitrobacter and Ntsp572 or Ntspa712 Nitrospira HOPE primers.

In addition the average relative abundance of Nitrospira reported by amplicon sequencing decreased from 10.5 to 0.01 from Phase A to D2 and the same decrease in relative abundance targeted by Ntspa572 was observed albeit with different relative abundance that de- creased from 3.9 to 0.01.Changes in biofilm reactor microbial community characterized by 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencingThe total microbial communities of the trickling biofilm reactor were characterized by 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing Fig.

The relative abundance of Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira obtained by 16S rRNA gene- based amplicon sequencing was also compared against that detected by Nso190 HOPE primer.Generally the relative abundance obtained by HOPE differed from that detected by amplicon sequencing but both datasets exhibited good Spearman's rank correlation Table .

Both Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira targeted by Nso190 also increased from 8.1 - 5.2 in Phase B to 26.4 - 8.2 in Phase E and 28.8 - 8.7 in Phase D2 Table However the increase in the relative abundance of Nso190-targets is mainly due to the increase in the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas.

Similarly the relative abundance of Nitros- pira targeted by Ntspa712 was 6.3 - 2.3 in Phase A and9.6 - 3.1 in Phase B and was significantly higher p  0.05 than that detected in Phases C 3.7 - 4.6 D1 0.9 - 1.8 E 2.3 - 2.9 and D2 2.7 - 1.9.In contrast to Nitrospira Nitrobacter detected by the Nit1017 primer increased in its relative abundance from4.8 - 3.2 in Phase B to 8.4 - 3.6 in Phase D2 Table However the Nit1000 primer did not perform in a similar manner as the Nit1017 primer despite both primers having similar detection coverage of most Nitro- bacter spp.

Unclassified Xanthomonadaceae had the highest relative abundance of 15.0 - 5.9 during Phases C and D1 and av- eraged a relative abundance of 4.6 - 3.1 in the remaining phases.

This is in contrast to the Nitrobacter species which are r-strategists with a lower NO- and oxygen affinity and outcompete Nitrospira only at higher substrate concentrations - An additional postulation to account for the better survival of Nitrobacter during shock loading events is its greater metabolic diversity under stressed conditions This genus exhibits versatile metabolism and is able to grow either mixotrophically or chemoorganotrophically Although Nitrobacter was able to withstand shock loading and increase in its relative abundance as quantified by HOPE it was observed that the increase in its relative abundance did not correlate with any decrease in nitrite content of the effluent.

It is gener- ally thought that Nitrospira-like bacteria are k-strategistsTable 3 Water quality for the influent effluent and chlorinated effluent samples collected from the wastewater treatment plant and the corresponding relative abundances of AOB and NOB as quantified using the HOPE and amplicon sequencing approachTotal nitrogenNH-N mgLNO --NNse1472Nsv443Ntspa712 Ntspa572 Nit1000Nitrosomonas NitrosospiraNitrobacterNitrospira4TN mgL3mgLRelative abundance  with respect to Eub338Ia HOPE dataRelative abundance  with respect to total bacteria Amplicon sequencing datawith a high affinity for NO- and oxygen and reach high densities under substrate-limited conditions.

Special emphasis was made to collate the relative abundance of the Nitrospira Nitrosomonas Nitrobacter and Nitrosospira so as to provide validation against the relative abundances of these genera obtained by HOPE method.
