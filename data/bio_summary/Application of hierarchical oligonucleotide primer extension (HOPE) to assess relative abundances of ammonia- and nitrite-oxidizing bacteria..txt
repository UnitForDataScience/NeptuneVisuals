were detected in a very low abundance of 0.1 throughout the operational phases by amplicon sequencing and coincides with the range of rela- tive abundance detected by hope using nit1000 primer r  0.68. in addition the average relative abundance of nitrospira reported by amplicon sequencing decreased from 10.5 to 0.01 from phase a to d2 and the same decrease in relative abundance targeted by ntspa572 was observed albeit with different relative abundance that de- creased from 3.9 to 0.01.changes in biofilm reactor microbial community characterized by 16s rrna gene-based amplicon sequencingthe total microbial communities of the trickling biofilm reactor were characterized by 16s rrna gene-based amplicon sequencing fig.

the average relative abundance of nitrospira targeted by ntspa572 was 3.9 - 0.3 in phase a and 4.3 - 1.2 in phase b and was significantly higher p  0.05 than that detected in phases c 1.2 - 1.6 d1 and e not detected and d2 0.01 - 0.03. similarly the relative abundance of nitros- pira targeted by ntspa712 was 6.3 - 2.3 in phase a and9.6 - 3.1 in phase b and was significantly higher p  0.05 than that detected in phases c 3.7 - 4.6 d1 0.9 - 1.8 e 2.3 - 2.9 and d2 2.7 - 1.9.in contrast to nitrospira nitrobacter detected by the nit1017 primer increased in its relative abundance from4.8 - 3.2 in phase b to 8.4 - 3.6 in phase d2 table however the nit1000 primer did not perform in a similar manner as the nit1017 primer despite both primers having similar detection coverage of most nitro- bacter spp.

table the nit1000 primer consistently failed to detect any nitrobacter in the latter operational phases and in samples that were detected with nitro- bacter the relative abundance was more than 2-fold lower than that detected by the nit1017 primer.validation of hope dataset obtained for trickling biofilm reactor with 16s rrna gene-based amplicon sequencing based on the hope primer coverage shown in additional file the relative abundance of genera nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrobacter and nitrospira obtained by 16s rrna gene-based amplicon sequencing was respectively compared against the relative abundance detected by nse1472 nitrosomonas nsv443 nitrosospira nit1000 or nit1017 nitrobacter and ntsp572 or ntspa712 nitrospira hope primers.

to negligible levels during the late operational phases p  0.004. other microbial populations that significantly decreased in their relative abundances across the different operational phases included unclassified actinobacteria clostridiaceae i rhodospirillales and deltaproteobacteria t-test p  0.005. unclassified xanthomonadaceae had the highest relative abundance of 15.0 - 5.9 during phases c and d1 and av- eraged a relative abundance of 4.6 - 3.1 in the remaining phases.

phases b and c t-test p  0.001. both nitrosomonas and nitrosospira targeted by nso190 also increased from 8.1 - 5.2 in phase b to 26.4 - 8.2 in phase e and 28.8 - 8.7 in phase d2 table however the increase in the relative abundance of nso190-targets is mainly due to the increase in the relative abundance of nitrosomonas.

the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira obtained by 16s rrna gene- based amplicon sequencing was also compared against that detected by nso190 hope primer.generally the relative abundance obtained by hope differed from that detected by amplicon sequencing but both datasets exhibited good spearman's rank correlation table .

this is in contrast to the nitrobacter species which are r-strategists with a lower no- and oxygen affinity and outcompete nitrospira only at higher substrate concentrations - an additional postulation to account for the better survival of nitrobacter during shock loading events is its greater metabolic diversity under stressed conditions this genus exhibits versatile metabolism and is able to grow either mixotrophically or chemoorganotrophically although nitrobacter was able to withstand shock loading and increase in its relative abundance as quantified by hope it was observed that the increase in its relative abundance did not correlate with any decrease in nitrite content of the effluent.

special emphasis was made to collate the relative abundance of the nitrospira nitrosomonas nitrobacter and nitrosospira so as to provide validation against the relative abundances of these genera obtained by hope method.

in addition the relative abundance of all taxonom- ical assignments obtained by miseq amplicon sequencing were collated alongside the relative abundances of thebacterial targets identified by hope.

this is because nitrosospira detected by primer nsv443 remained stable in its relative abundance against the total community throughout the op- erational phases phase a not detected phase b 2.1 - 1.8 phase c 4.3 - 2.9 phase d1 4.6 - 3.0 phase e3.3 - 1.5 phase d2 5.2 - 1.5. the changes in the rela-tive abundance of nsv443-targeted nitrosospira were not42nitrate no --n concentrations in influent and effluent samples n  75 each collected every 2-3 d throughout the reactor operational period were measured using test 'n tube high range ammonia kit tntplus 839 and tntplus 835 respectively.

hence establishing an optimal ratio and abundance of aobaoa to nob is important in ensuring the functionality of the nitrification process so that treated effluent will meet the discharge limits for tn.in such instance a quantitative method capable of efficiently targeting aobaoa and nob relative abundances would be particularly useful in tracking the proportional ratio between these two groups.

aside from its multiplexing capability it was demonstrated that hope has a detection limit of 0.1 of the total pcr-amplified bacterial targets and that the entire duration required to carry out a single hope reaction and to analyze for the ex- tended primer on a dna sequencer is 1 h which would be comparable to the time needed to carry out qpcr given the advantages of hope the method is a poten- tially useful tool in tracking the relative abundance of nitrifying populations.

the relative abundance of 16s rrna gene ampli- cons targeted by primer a with respect to those targeted by primer b can then be calculated based on eq.
