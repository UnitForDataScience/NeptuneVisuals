for example in a longitudinal study that compared diarrheal samples to pre- diarrheal matched controls pcr stool analysis was shown to correlate with diarrhea due to rotavirus astrovirus and shigellaenteroinvasive escherichia coli only when the data were analyzed quantitatively 8. similarly a study of enteropathogens in diarrhea cases and non- diarrheal controls found high rates of detection even in asymptomatic controls the specificity improved when pathogen quantity was assessed 9. in these ways the calculation and interpretation of pathogen burden is of critical importance to the utility of these pcr methods.in resource-limited settings diarrhea-causing enteropathogens have most commonly been described in hospitalized children with acutepersistent severe diarrhea 10 11. in hospitalized children under 5 years in dar es salaam tanzania diarrheagenic e. coli was found by standard bacteriologic culture 12 in 22.9  of patients 13. however the etiology of more common ambulatory diarrhea in tanzania remains poorly reported.

we sought to determine the etiology of community-acquired diarrhea in tanzanian infants and young children and hypothesized that identifiable diarrheal infections would correlate with a high pathogen burden and place children at risk for suboptimal growth.

these are quantities previously associated with diarrhea in similar settings 7. there was no difference in pathogen detection in children receiving zinc n14 vs. n47 in the group with any pathogen vs. no pathogen detected respectively p0.25 or multivitamin supplementation n17 vs. n51 p0.47.one subject had two pathogens detected simultaneously epec and campylobacter.compared to children without an identified pathogen subjects with any identified enteropathogen had significantly lower wlz -0.55 - 1.10 vs. 0.03 - 1.30 p0.03 at the final clinic visit.
