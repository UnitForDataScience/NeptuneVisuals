In addition microbial participants in the macro- phyte decomposition in freshwater lakes remain little known al- though such degradation occurs widespread in aquatic ecosys- tems and stream environments.In this work we focused on the associated microbes in- volved in the decomposition of macrophyte leaf litters and their variations during the decomposition process to answer the fol- lowing questions first which types of bacteria and fungi take part in the decomposition of macrophyte leaf litters at thesurface sediment Second what are the dominant factors reg- ulating the bacterial and fungal community composition for the decomposition of certain leaf litter Third what are the primary relationships between bacteria and fungi during mi- crobial decomposition In situ experiments were set up to ad- dress these above questions and 150-day incubation of macro- phyte litters was established under universal environmental conditions to avoid heterogeneous effects on the process.

Furthermore a few studies have investigated the emergent Rejma'nkova' and Sirova'  or sub- merged macrophyte decomposition Hahn  in wetlands while fewer works have considered the decomposition of dif- ferent types of macrophytes simultaneously and related micro- bial community and activity which more accurately reflects field conditions.

In situ experiments 150 days were conducted to study the decomposition processes of macrophyte leaf litters Zizania latifolia Zl Hydrilla verticillata Hv and Nymphoides peltata Np.

The decomposition of Np leaf litter was fastest whereas Zl was slowest.
