Combining these data with the lower milk production we can conclude that REN cows do not exhibit marked negative energy status in the days immediately after calving.Moreover REN cows demonstrated the ability to maintain lowerlevels of the mastitis markers cathelicidin and SCC and therefore of mammary tissue inflammation this ability is of significant interest especially in the post-partum period and it appears to be combined with the capability of REN cows to release in colostrum a higher amount of other immune-related proteins such as lysozyme that efficiently pro- tect the mammary gland against pathogen infections.

At T1 and T2 HF cows presented a lower percentage of positive bacterial culture results 33.3 and 33.3 respectively when com- pared to REN 40.0 and 41.7 respectively while at T3 and T4 we observed the opposite with a higher percentage of samples with posi- tive bacterial culture in HF 20.8 and 29.2 respectively vs REN 12.5 and 12.5 respectively.

Interestingly HF seemed to be unable to up-regulate PTX3 during such presumed infection whereas REN significantly up-regulated PTX3 P  0.0001 B.T1 whereas the opposite was observed in suspected IMIsubclinicalmastitis samples as shown in B. Interestingly the CD45KRT5 expression ratio was always lower in REN vs HF cows at all times A.

Taken together the results presented here suggest that HF cows seem to develop a greater systemic and local in the mammary gland inflammatory condition compared to the autochthonous REN breed although our findings will require validation on larger animal cohorts to allow for final conclu- sions.Cows of both breeds showed the typical variations of in- flammometabolic profile around calving previously described in healthy periparturient dairy cows  .

With respect to HF cows REN cows showed stronger innate immune responses in the mammary gland in terms of proinflammatory cytokines PTX3 and leukocyteepithelial cell ratio shortly after calving.

The average milk yield was significantly higher in HF compared to REN HF  5366 kg vs REN  3769 p  0.0147.

The percentage of milk fat HF  3.52 vs REN  3.37 and protein HF  3.02 vs REN  3.08 content was comparable in the two breeds.This study complied with Italian laws on animal experimentation and ethics Italian Health Ministry authorization n. 6282016-PR.SamplesQuarter milk samples and venous blood were collected from each animal at the following time points dry-off T1 1 day after calving T2 7-10 days after calving T3 and 30 days after calving T4.

At the genus level REN milk showed the predominance of Streptococcus 71 followed by Lactobacillus 10 and Pediococcus 6 while HF milk was dominated by Strep- tococcus 29 followed by Lactobacillus 6 Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus 4 B and C. Among streptococci Streptococcus thermophilus was the most prevalent 48 in REN milk in comparison with only 2 in HF D and E.The protein profile of colostrum is different in the two breedsFor estimating milk protein profiles at T2 T3 and T4 the same volume of each sample 0.1 ml was subjected to SDS-PAGE and densi- tometric analysis.

SCC was determined by an automated fluorescent microscopic somatic cell counter it is expressed as 103 cellsml.Table 2Medians and interquartile ranges in parentheses of SCC and cathelicidin in milk of the two breeds.Moreover PTX3 expression level was significantly lower in suspected IMIsubclinical mastitis samples from HF compared to REN P  0.0283 B. Non-significant NS but consistently higherMilkHFRENexpression was seen for IL-1R8 in REN at all times when compared tosampling HF.

Proin- flammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNFa presented lower expression levels in REN milk cells compared to HF at all time points apart from colostrum T2 where REN samples showed higher cytokine gene ex- pression levels TNF P  0.005 A.
