Although this study was not placebo-controlled clinical response 35 and remission rates 15 were similar to a recently reported placebo-controlled trial 39 response and 24 remission at week 7.4 A recent multidonor intensive FMT strategy requiring daily enema therapy showed even higher remis- sion rates.5 FMT with 2 donor FMP in our study was well toler- ated and the frequency of grade 1 adverse events was consistent with the expected incidence in both the treatment and controls reported previously.34 These data coupled with the significant decrease in week 4 Mayo score and endoscopic subscore suggest that the 2 donor FMP is safe and effective.

909diversity correlates with response in recurrent C. difficile-asso- ciated diarrhea.1 While pilot studies of FMT in Crohn's dis- ease18 showed an increase in both diversity and donor engraftment which correlated with clinical response the corre- lation of diversity and engraftment with clinical response in UC was modest.34 Using a 2-donor FMP to provide greater micro- bial diversity our results reveal a robust increase in both diver- sity and engraftment in all subjects regardless of clinical response.

Although this real world approach allowed us to capture robust week 4 clinical responses in biologic naive patients larger placebo- controlled trials are needed to evaluate durable FMT strategies in both biological naive and refractory patients.

All the seven week 4 responders maintained improvements in clinical scores at week 12 but longer follow-up will be needed to evaluate the efficacy of less intensive therapy which may ultimately be more practical for patient care.Given the restricted microbial diversity of a UC recipient with active disease diversity and donor engraftment have been used as metrics of clinical efficacy.

Longman MD PhDBackground Recent trials suggest fecal microbiota transplantation FMT with repeated enemas and high-diversity FMT donors is a promising treatment to induce remission in ulcerative colitis.Methods We designed a prospective open-label pilot study to assess the safety clinical efficacy and microbial engraftment of single FMT delivery by colonoscopy for active ulcerative colitis using a 2-donor fecal microbiota preparation FMP.

Donor composition correlated with clinical response and further characterization of immunological parameters may provide insight into factors influencing clinical outcome.Inflamm Bowel Dis 201723903-911Key Words microbiome fecal microbiota transplantation ulcerative colitisecal microbiota transplantation FMT has emerged as an effec- tive therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and increased microbial diversity is a characteristic feature of a success- ful responder1 however the efficacy of FMT for inflammatorybowel disease IBD remains unclear.

B Alpha diversity metrics of observed OTUs left panel and Shannon index right panel are compared for recipient pretransplant pre and at week 2 W2 and 4 W4 after FMT.

These data suggest that a single colonoscopic delivery of 2-donor FMP is safe and effective in increasing microbial diversity in patients with active UC.Donor Composition Correlates with Clinical ResponseIn addition to the significantly enhanced diversity of 2 donor FMP principal coordinate analysis of Bray-Curtis dissim- ilarity matrix revealed significant differences between 2-donor FMP and pretransplant recipients Fig.

Fecal DNA and rectal biopsies were used to characterize the microbiome and mucosal CD4 T cells respectively before and after FMT.Results Of the 20 patients enrolled in this study 7 patients 35 achieved a clinical response by week 4.
