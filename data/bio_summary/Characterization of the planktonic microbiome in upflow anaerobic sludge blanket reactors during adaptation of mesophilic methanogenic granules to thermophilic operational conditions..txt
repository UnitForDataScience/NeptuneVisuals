Taxonomic groups genus and family level that changed significantly in relative abundance from L3 to L4 samples.period where the granules were disturbed by increase of opera- tional temperature but not during the operational periods where the operational temperature was kept at 55 oC.The maintenance of the granular structure during the operational periods was previ- ously reported to be attributed by the present of Anaerolinaceae members in the granules .

Therefore under such operational conditions the mi- crobial community evolving in the liquid phase of the UASB reactor would also contribute to the substrate degradation and might in- fluence the granule microbial consortium.To characterize the planktonic microbial community in UASB reactors next generation sequencing technology targeting the 16S rRNA gene was employed in the current study which is a contin- uation of our previous work .

In total 68 genera or equivalent that were in the top 90 of the community in at least one granule or liquid sample were reported.During the start-up period members of genus Clostridium 22.5 and order Thermoanaerobacterales 5.5 were present at high relative abundance in liquid.

During both operational periods theplanktonic microbiota largely influenced microbial composition of granules as the majority of highly abundant OTUs in liquid phases 74.9 of L3 and 86.0 of L4 were also found in the corresponding granular phase G3 and G4.At the current operational conditions of the UASB reactors the planktonic microbiota was mainly composed by hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria which are expected to have a faster growth rate.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study aiming to elucidate the mi- crobial diversity and dynamicity in the liquid phase of a UASB reactor during the adaptation of mesophilic methanogenic granules to thermophilic operational conditions.Materials and methodsReactor operation descriptionA lab scale UASB reactor fed with potato juice was started with mesophilic methanogenic granules G1 and operated at thermo- philic conditions.

The low degradation rate indicated that the microbial community in mes- ophilic granules was not sufficient enough to promptly start the digestion process however the production of VFA indicated that some fermentative bacteria were already present in the system which is consistent with the microbial community analysis dis- cussed in the next section.

In contrary during operational periods 1 and 2 in which the HRT was shortened to 7 days the microbes that could not adapt to the operational conditions were removed from the reactor resulting into a much simpler microbial community.A visual representation of the OTUs in the different liquid samples is illustrated in the phylogenetic tree Supplementary Fig.

The same process could also explain the presence in the liquid of the genera Meth- anobacterium 8.4 E6 6.1 Streptococcus 3.1 and HA73 1.5.During the first operational period the short HRT i.e.

In order to analyse the dynamicity of microbial consortium in the liquid phase and to draw a potential correlation with the granule microbial community PCA was performed on both liquid and granule samples see .
