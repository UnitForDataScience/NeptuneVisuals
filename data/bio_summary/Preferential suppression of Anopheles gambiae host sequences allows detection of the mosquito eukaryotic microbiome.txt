the density of unassigned eukaryotic sequences revealed by the pna blocking strategy presented here is promising for future work on the environmental ecology of eukaryotic microbial diversity in mosquito vectors.in contrast with the results observed in the larval samples blood-fed adult mosquito samples would require a second pna blocker specific for mammals to increase the amplification of the eukaryotic microbiome.

these results indicate that the reported pna blockers could be implemented in high-throughput field surveys of adult mosquito populations to simultaneously explore the presence and diversity of plasmodium and other related apicomplexan parasites in adult mosquito populations.high throughput surveys of eukaryotic microbial diversity by barcoding 18s rrna gene sequences has been carried out in natural environments  - confirming that the evolutionary and ecological importance of eukaryotic microbes is much higher than traditionally thought and suggesting that the number of eukaryotic microbial species may easily exceed one million with a large fraction of unknown eukaryotic microbial diver- sity that remains to be characterized.

here we found that amplification and sequencing of the v4 region using our pna blockers is the most informative approach for discovery of the anopheles eukaryotic microbiome.the present work opens the way towards the high-throughput characterization of the eukaryotic microbial diversity associated with the anopheles microbiome which will also facilitate study of the interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic components of mosquito microbiome in the context of vector competence for plasmodium parasite transmission.

larval samples with pna blocker exhibited efficient block- ing of mosquito host 18s rrna gene amplification increasing the amplification of the eukaryotic microbiome with the v9 region showing the maximum number of eukaryotic microbiota reads at 7.5 mm pna concentration whereas the v4 region displayed maximum eukaryotic microbiota reads at 1.5 mm pna concentration fig.

the strategy could subsequently be applied to field collected samples of different developmental stages with metadata for ecological zone mosquito species and larval pool type.the v4-region pna blocker displays the highest blocking efficiency reducing the fraction of host dna ampli- fication by 46.0x in the animal-fed adult mosquito sample from 82.8 to 1.8 of mosquito amplicons at 7.5 mm concentration of v4-pna blocker and by 4.8x in the larval sample from 99.5 to 20.8 of mosquito amplicons at 7.5 mm concentration of the pna blocker.

in human bloodmeal and animal bloodmeal samples the progressive replacement of mosquito host by mammal sequences with increasing pna concentration explains the patterns of evenness observed.rarefaction analyses of v9 and v4 amplicon datasets yields similar results showing that the eukaryotic com- munity found in larval samples amplified with pna blockers is the most phylogenetically diverse of the three sources of samples analysed figure .

of these 4137310 81.89 of the total full-length v4 amplicons were reconstructed after quality filtering and joining steps 129290.94 amplicons per sample on average and clustered into 119 operational taxonomic units otus of a minimum size of 5 reads from which the taxonomic profiles of the samples across all conditions withwithout pna blockers or pcr annealing block- ers were determined by sequence similarity against the 18s rrna gene subdivision of silva database version 119. as expected mosquito was the predominant taxonomic group in v4 amplicons from samples amplified with- out any blocker ranging from 99 of the amplicons in larval samples to 80-97 of the amplicons in human and animal fed samples fig.

in order to design pna blockers specific to anopheles but allowing efficient amplification of other eukaryotic organisms the silva eukaryotic database was queried with mosquito candidate sequences to identify those with the smallest number of non-mosquito hits.

aspositive controls the reference universal eukaryotic pcr amplification primers v9-forward and v4-reverse primers were also queried against the silva database right bar in each frame.a100b1007575505025250050100150nucleotide position of the 18s v9 region of anopheles gambiae00100200300400500nucleotide position of the 18s v4 region of anopheles gambiaefigure 2. identification of pna oligonucleotide blocker candidates for the v9 region of anopheles.

the amplicon counts of non- anopheles and mammal sequences indicates the efficiency of detection of eukaryotic microbiome lineages shown as a function of blocking strategy used as well as pna blocker concentration.concentration-dependent effect on background reduction by the v9 pna blocker was less efficient than by the v4 pna blocker.as with v4 the decrease in the fraction of mosquito reads in human and animal-bloodmeal containing adult samples is accompanied by an increase in the fraction of mammalian reads fig.

more data from field samples would be necessary to evaluate the presence of this group in natural mosquito populations but the predominance in our larval sample points to these taxa as a likely important component of the mosquito eukaryotic microbiome.

the lack of ability to use kapa proofreading polymerase is another argument against annealing blockers because use of a proofreading polymerase can increase information content by amplifying target from organisms with primer mismatches.in contrast the anopheles v4 pna blocker displayed high blocking efficiency of anopheles host 18s rrna sequences in all three samples larval human-bloodmeal containing adult and animal-bloodmeal containing adult with a pna concentration-dependent reduction of mosquito host sequences fig.

for each control sample ten individual mosquito dna samples were pooled at equal volume and a total of control samples were made representing three distinct mosquito life stages i larvae ii female adults containing human bloodmeal mosquitoes that fed in nature with blood confirmed as human derived all positive for presence of plasmodium and iii female adults containing animal bloodmeal as with ii except the bloodmeal was of animal origin and was negative for plasmodium.

however the eukaryotic members of the anopheles microbiota remain poorly described largely due to the absence of high-throughput methods for their identification.microscopic examination and insect pathology studies have identified a handful of eukaryotic microbes including microsporidia gregarines and trypanosomatids in different mosquitoes-.

finally it was proposed that a gregarine protozoan could harbour chikungunya virus and help maintain the virus in the aedes mosquito vector population.a major obstacle in high-throughput surveys of eukaryotic microbiota in eukaryotic hosts is that the host organism has its own 18s rrna gene and general amplification of this host gene overwhelms the microbial 18s rrna gene signal.
