The vaginal microbiota has also been shown to change dramatically across the menopausal period .This is theoretically very important as it is likely that just as venereal pathological organisms can be introduced into the lower male genital tract so too can otherwise commensal organisms of the lower female genital tract.HypothesisThis makes it likely that the change in the female genital micro- biota experienced in the perimenopausal period is the likely source and origin of the chronic inflammatory and chronic infective con- dition which becomes the stimulus first to chronic inflammation in the prostate which becomes manifest as BPH and secondly with chronicity and establishment of a chronic disorder malignant transformation.Formal testingThis hypothesis could be readily tested in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies with paired samples from male and female sex- ual partners over the transitional period as the woman transitions through the fifth and sixth decades of life.

Hence the major hypothesis is that prostatic cancer may arise due to chronic infection and inflammation in the prostate gland consequent upon the altered microbiome of the menopausal female genital tract.

Since prostate cancer seemed to have a chronic inflammatory and likely infective basis it was felt that anti-inflammatory andor antibacterial treatment may offer an avenue for the prevention of prostate cancer .These observations clearly establish that benign prostatic hypertrophy BPH whilst holoendemic in older males is in fact not normal and is indeed a premalignant condition.PathobiologyThere are many tissues where chronic inflammation leads to malignant transformation and in some respects it should come as no surprise that this progression is observed in the prostate gland also.

It should perhaps be noted here that BPH is rare in alcoholics and hypogonadal males likely related to the relatively hyperestrogenic milieu .Key trialRecent re-analysis of the control arm of a classical US Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial PCPT trial made three seminal and piv- otal observations in relation to prostatic disease in otherwise nor- mal prostate glands  firstly that chronic inflammation within the prostate gland was associated with prostatic carcinoma O.R.

The recent demonstration that far from being benign ''benign pro- static hypertrophy is a likely a reaction of the prostate to chronic untreated lower genital tract infection and that this chronic inflammation is likely the usual precursor to the frequent occurrence of prostatic carcinoma has far reaching implications.

Moreover the lifetime incidence of female breast cancer is much less at 12.4 .However it is extraordinary that a premalignant condition BPH suddenly appears in one decade of life as a holoendemic con-dition across the whole male population but is almost unknown in the prior decades It is also extraordinary that the condition goes from being almost unknown in the 500s to having a median age of onset at 66 years only 16 years laterThe findings from the ground-breaking Gurel study would clearly carry several major aetiopathological implicationsBPH far from being benign as its name implies is actually a premalignant conditionBPH is likely a reaction of the prostate to chronic inflammationBPH is not normal.As suggested by the authors the most likely cause of the chronic prostatic inflammation is chronic lower urinary tract infection.

The prostate is part of the male lower genital tract LGT and can become implicated in lower genital infective conditions often in combination with seminal vesiculitis or epididymitis.

Techniques which may be investi- gated and tested may include antiseptic douches for the female perimenopausal and menopausal genital tract prior to sexual con- tact or some form of genital specific antibiotic therapy for males.

The obvious source for the chronic inflammatory stimulus in the prostate is the documented dramatically altered lower female genital microbiota associated with the menopause.
