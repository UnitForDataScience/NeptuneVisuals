This identified the following modules as being significantly differ- ent Po0.1 after correction between Prevotella and Clostridium 'Pyruvate oxidation' 'Hydroxypropio- nate-hydroxybutyrate' 'Phosphate acetyltransferase- acetate kinase pathway acetyl-CoA  4 acetate' were more diverse in Prevotella whereas 'PRPP biosynthesis ribose 5P' 'Cysteine biosynthesis--ser- ine' 'Formaldehyde assimilation--ribulose monopho- sphate pathway' 'Formaldehyde assimilation--serine pathway' were found more diverse in Clostridium  Supplementary Table S4.Enzyme Commission ClassificationTwenty-one EC showed significantly divergent rates Po0.05 between Prevotella and Clostridium.The EC with significantly higher diversity in Prevotella included oxidoreductases acting on the CH-OH group of donors EC 1.1.- the aldehyde or oxo group of donors EC 1.2.-  and on the CH-NH2 group of donors EC 1.4.- Hydrolases acting on peptide bonds EC 3.4.- General lyases EC 4.99.- and the intramolecular oxidoreductase category of isomerases EC 5.3.- Supplementary Figure S2.The EC with a significantly higher pNpS distribu- tion in Clostridium included oxidoreductases acting on the CH-CH group of donors EC 1.3.- and on NADH or NAPH EC 1.6.- transferases transferring aldehyde or ketonic groups EC 2.2.- acyltrans- ferases EC 2.3.- glycosyltransferases EC 2.4.- and transferring phosphorus-containing groups EC 2.7.- hydrolases specifically glycosylases EC 3.2.- those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds EC 3.5.- and those acting on carbon-carbon bonds EC 3.7.- carbon-carbon lyases EC 4.1.-Figure 3 Genes marked in blue and red are significantly different between Prevotella and Clostridium and are part of the carbon metabolism pathway in KEGG.

Genes in red have a higher average in Clostridium.racemases and epimerases EC 5.1.- and cis-trans- isomerases EC 5.2.- from isomerases and finally ligases forming carbon-oxygen bonds EC 6.1.- carbon-sulfur bonds EC 6.2.- and nitrogen-metal bonds EC 6.6.- Supplementary Figure S3.Supporting this genes found to be significantly divergent between Prevotella and Clostridium werealso statistically overrepresented in 14 of the EC already identified.

The expected number of changes is calculated in a similar way as in dnds calculations using a neutral model to determine the proportion of either non- synonymous or synonymous SNPs that would be expected given the reference sequence for the gene LiThe MGKit package provides routines for these calculations on a per-isoform basis but they can be extended to different levels of specificity for example using genus instead of species or enzymes grouped into different EC levels such as 3.4.1.3 or EC 3.4.-.

Our results indicate that this is likely the case as Prevotella has a more diverse range of isoforms to degrade the hemicellu- lose matrix formed of pectins EC 5.3.- and peptides EC 3.4.- whereas Clostridium has a more diverse range of isoforms for degrading cellulose EC 3.2.-.

Subsequently a 20-ml aliquot was transferred using a pipette and sterilised tip into a separate labelled sterilised container immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 degC until processing 012.Sampling metagenomic library preparation and sequencingDNA was extracted from rumen fluid samples using the repeat bead beating and column purification method of .

The raw sequence data can be accessed at the European Nucleotide Archive using the study ID ERP009980.Gene and taxonomy predictionGene predictions were carried out on the assembly using HMMER version 3.0 To do this HMM profiles of known genes were generated foreach gene family from within each group of organisms from the rumen .

All P-values were cor- rected for multiple testing using the Benjamini- Hochberg method as implemented in R  using a significance threshold for the corrected value of 0.1.Enzyme Commission ClassificationFunctional diversity was also estimated for all predicted genes from the metagenomic data thatFigure 1 Gene counts from the three most abundant genera in the rumen samples.

Samples of rumen fluid were collected using a transesophageal sampling device FLORA rumen scoop Guelph ON Canada.

However our estimates of the proportion of archaeal genes in the rumen metagenome from Methanobrevibacter 76.47 and the relative proportions of genes from the major groups of bacteria are similar to those that were previously reported  suggesting no sampling bias.Diversity estimatesWe found that levels of adaptive variation pNpS vary widely between microbial genera from the rumen 6 similar to that found between human gut microbes and that this extends to functional classes of genes 2 Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 and also for the same genes from different genera.However the level of variation in these calcula- tions between samples was related to the abundanceof each genus in the rumen microbiome 6 and therefore the depth of sequencing achieved for each.

We concatenated all the genes from same second-level EC classification that is EC 1.1.- 1.2.- and so on only including a predicted gene if it had been found in both Prevotella and Clostridium in at least seven samples.
