this identified the following modules as being significantly differ- ent po0.1 after correction between prevotella and clostridium 'pyruvate oxidation' 'hydroxypropio- nate-hydroxybutyrate' 'phosphate acetyltransferase- acetate kinase pathway acetyl-coa  4 acetate' were more diverse in prevotella whereas 'prpp biosynthesis ribose 5p' 'cysteine biosynthesis--ser- ine' 'formaldehyde assimilation--ribulose monopho- sphate pathway' 'formaldehyde assimilation--serine pathway' were found more diverse in clostridium  supplementary table s4.enzyme commission classificationtwenty-one ec showed significantly divergent rates po0.05 between prevotella and clostridium.the ec with significantly higher diversity in prevotella included oxidoreductases acting on the ch-oh group of donors ec 1.1.- the aldehyde or oxo group of donors ec 1.2.-  and on the ch-nh2 group of donors ec 1.4.- hydrolases acting on peptide bonds ec 3.4.- general lyases ec 4.99.- and the intramolecular oxidoreductase category of isomerases ec 5.3.- supplementary figure s2.the ec with a significantly higher pnps distribu- tion in clostridium included oxidoreductases acting on the ch-ch group of donors ec 1.3.- and on nadh or naph ec 1.6.- transferases transferring aldehyde or ketonic groups ec 2.2.- acyltrans- ferases ec 2.3.- glycosyltransferases ec 2.4.- and transferring phosphorus-containing groups ec 2.7.- hydrolases specifically glycosylases ec 3.2.- those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds ec 3.5.- and those acting on carbon-carbon bonds ec 3.7.- carbon-carbon lyases ec 4.1.-figure 3 genes marked in blue and red are significantly different between prevotella and clostridium and are part of the carbon metabolism pathway in kegg.

genes in red have a higher average in clostridium.racemases and epimerases ec 5.1.- and cis-trans- isomerases ec 5.2.- from isomerases and finally ligases forming carbon-oxygen bonds ec 6.1.- carbon-sulfur bonds ec 6.2.- and nitrogen-metal bonds ec 6.6.- supplementary figure s3.supporting this genes found to be significantly divergent between prevotella and clostridium werealso statistically overrepresented in 14 of the ec already identified.

taxonomic assignments of the annotated regions were carried out using blast version 2.2.25 against a local copy of the nr protein database may 2013 options -outfmt 6. the best match with a bit score 460 was used as simulations indicated that when using this cut-off hits were correctly assigned at the genus level 95 of the time supplementary file 1.alignmentall 14 sample reads were individually aligned to the final assembly using bowtie2 version 2.0.5 options -n 1. possible pcr and optical duplicate reads were identified using picard tools  version 1.58. abundance of reads mapping to each annotation was calculated with htseq-count from the htseq package version 0.5.4p3 options -s no -t gene -i koidx -q.snpssnps were called from each of the alignments sepa- rately using the gatk pipeline  version 2.1.8. with the unifiedgenotyper tool options -dcov 50 for 4 x coverage alignment.

the expected number of changes is calculated in a similar way as in dnds calculations using a neutral model to determine the proportion of either non- synonymous or synonymous snps that would be expected given the reference sequence for the gene lithe mgkit package provides routines for these calculations on a per-isoform basis but they can be extended to different levels of specificity for example using genus instead of species or enzymes grouped into different ec levels such as 3.4.1.3 or ec 3.4.-. this involves concatenating isoforms belong- ing to the specific taxonomic and functional level before performing the calculation.

when calculating the rates of pnps of individual functions within taxonomic groups if multiple genes from the assembly were annotated with the same function and taxonomy they were concatenated and the rates of pnps calculated across all the concatenated sequences.statistical analysis of functional divergencepairwise comparisons of the distribution of pnps calculations for genes were carried out between taxa using a two-sample wilcoxon rank-sum test as implemented in the scipy package version 0.15.1. in this analysis pairwise statistical tests were carried out between all genes shared between methanobrevibacter clostridium and prevotella 1. all p-values were cor- rected for multiple testing using the benjamini- hochberg method as implemented in r  using a significance threshold for the corrected value of 0.1.enzyme commission classificationfunctional diversity was also estimated for all predicted genes from the metagenomic data thatfigure 1 gene counts from the three most abundant genera in the rumen samples.

scaling these numbers according to average genome sizes using sequenced organisms from these groups actually increases this trend supplementary table s3 5. however our estimates of the proportion of archaeal genes in the rumen metagenome from methanobrevibacter 76.47 and the relative proportions of genes from the major groups of bacteria are similar to those that were previously reported  suggesting no sampling bias.diversity estimateswe found that levels of adaptive variation pnps vary widely between microbial genera from the rumen 6 similar to that found between human gut microbes and that this extends to functional classes of genes 2 supplementary figures s2 and s3 and also for the same genes from different genera.however the level of variation in these calcula- tions between samples was related to the abundanceof each genus in the rumen microbiome 6 and therefore the depth of sequencing achieved for each.

our results indicate that this is likely the case as prevotella has a more diverse range of isoforms to degrade the hemicellu- lose matrix formed of pectins ec 5.3.- and peptides ec 3.4.- whereas clostridium has a more diverse range of isoforms for degrading cellulose ec 3.2.-. this coupled with their divergence for function in metabolic processes indicate that isoform diversity plays an important role in maintaining their niche specialisation.our results demonstrate the potential power of evolutionary approaches in understanding microbial communities in vivo.

subsequently a 20-ml aliquot was transferred using a pipette and sterilised tip into a separate labelled sterilised container immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 degc until processing 012.sampling metagenomic library preparation and sequencingdna was extracted from rumen fluid samples using the repeat bead beating and column purification method of .

the raw sequence data can be accessed at the european nucleotide archive using the study id erp009980.gene and taxonomy predictiongene predictions were carried out on the assembly using hmmer version 3.0 to do this hmm profiles of known genes were generated foreach gene family from within each group of organisms from the rumen .

one explanation may be that the horizontal acquisition of a single isoform of a novel gene is not enough to maintain a competitive advantage in fluctuating environmental conditions where a range of isoforms may be required to for instance maintain enzymatic activity correspondence cj creevey institute of biological environmen- tal and rural sciences ibers aberystwyth university room f.15 carwyn james building penglais campus aberystwyth sy23 3fg uk.e-mail received 20 march 2016 revised 28 july 2016 accepted21 september 2016 published online 13 january 2017the rumen microbiome of sheep and cattle is a case in point temperature and ph fluctuate daily in response to ambient conditions and the biomass consumed m. as a potential source of industrially important enzymes  antimicrobial agents and greenhouse gases   understanding how the microbiome maintains robustness to environmental fluctuations and how this may be manipulated is an important goal.identifying gene isoforms from metagenomic sequ- ence data remains a difficult challenge as assembly approaches vastly oversimplify the true microbial diversity present recently approaches that involve mapping metagenomic sequence reads which preserve the lost variability to sequenced microbial genomes have attempted to address this by identifying single- nucleotide polymorphisms snps representing varia- tion in the microbial population  using methods adapted from traditional dnds calculations of adaptive evolution between species  they calculated the genomic variation in the human gut microbiome based on the ratio of the rates of occurrence of snps that either cause a mutation in the translated amino acid sequence non-synonymous mutations pn or preserve the translated amino acid sequence synon- ymous mutations ps the population with a higher pnps ratio for any function likely reflects the possession of greater numbers of distinct functional isoforms of that gene 3. furthermore as this calculation uses the rate of synonymous substitutions as a baseline it is robust to differences in the size of the populations compared.we have adapted this approach to examine the rates of pnps for all shared functions between the two most abundant genera of bacteria in the rumen.

samples of rumen fluid were collected using a transesophageal sampling device flora rumen scoop guelph on canada.

we concatenated all the genes from same second-level ec classification that is ec 1.1.- 1.2.- and so on only including a predicted gene if it had been found in both prevotella and clostridium in at least seven samples.

a wilcoxon rank-sum test as implemented in r was used to test whether the distribution of diversity estimates for any ec number was significantly different between the two groups and the p-values were corrected as previously described.over-representation analysisthe ec classifications that were found to have significantly different pnps values between pre- votella and clostridium were used for an over- representation analysis.

the significantly different ec numbers were used as foreground for the analysis whereas the rest of the all ec numbers prevotella and clostridium had in common were used as background.

in particular the ec 1.1.- 1.2.- 1.4.- 5.3.- and 3.4.- were significantly overrepre- sented in the set of genes that were more diverse in prevotella po0.001 and the ec 1.3.- 2.3.- 2.4.-2.7.- 3.2.- 3.5.- 4.1.- 5.1. and 6.1.- were significantly overrepresented in the set of genes that were morefigure 4 variation for module of the carbon metabolism that were found to be significantly different.
