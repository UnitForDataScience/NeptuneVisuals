Letters to the EditorJPGN  Volume 65 Number 1 July 2017Apropos ''Gut Microbiota Differences in Children From Distinct Socioeconomic Levels Living in the Same Urban Area in Brazil''o the Editor The study authored by Mello et al 1 introduces a novel insight by comparing the human gut microbial composition in children living in the same geographic area stra- tified by socioeconomic status.

The intestinal microbial composition of children living in a favela near a sanitary landfill differ significantly from that of children of high socioeconomic status having adequate hygienic- sanitary conditions.

J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 201663460-5.Microbiota Environment and Dieto the Editor We are grateful for the interest in our article regarding the intestinal microbiota of children living in different environmental conditions 1.

Other studies have com- pared the intestinal microbiota among children in different countries 2 - 4.

Gut microbiota differences in children from distinct socioeconomic levels living in the same urban area in Brazil.

Impact of diet in shaping gut microbiota revealed by a comparative study in children from Europe and rural Africa.

Mello et al discussed the location of the perceived ''slum'' and presented example pictures of the area however detailed criteria to what constituted as a ''slum'' are missing and lead readers to believe slums were identified subjec- tively.
