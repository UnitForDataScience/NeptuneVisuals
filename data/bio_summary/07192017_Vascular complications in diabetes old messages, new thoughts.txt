Fotheringham14Received 19 January 2017  Accepted 12 May 2017  Published online 19 July 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017Abstract In parallel with the growing diabetes pandemic there is an increasing burden of micro- and macrovascular complications occurring in the majority of patients.

Hence the actual numbers of individuals affected by diabetes complications is still increasing.The quest for novel therapies to prevent andor treat diabe- tes complications remains paramount.

Interestingly there is also evidence that early progression to complications may be clinically 'silent' as previously de- scribed for type 1 diabetes  making temporal patterns of disease development difficult to map.Finally this review serves as a reminder that there is sig- nificant value in research time spent convincing governments and funding bodies to ensure equitable research expenditure per affected individual comparable with diseases such as AIDS and cancer.New slants on old theories 'know thine enemy'Glucose control Since the DCCT  and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study UKPDS  showed that early intensive glu- cose control reduced the risk for complications this has been amajor clinical goal in diabetic individuals.

In line with this surrogate measures of AGEs such as skin auto-fluores- cence are increasingly being evaluated as predictors of both glucose control and risk for diabetic complications .Studies have shown a clear temporal bias attached to the benefits of strict glycaemic control on complications Fig.

Interestingly although the DCCT Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Trial EDIC showed that strict glycaemic control for a short period in young adults with type 1 diabetes 13-39 years of age delayed complications by approximately 6 years other studies have shown that RAS blockade has no such effect in the same age group .Poor glycaemic control in individuals with early-onset type 2 diabetes 30 years of age confers greater risk for develop- ing complications than age-matched individuals with type 1diabetes or those with adult-onset type 2 diabetes.

It will be interesting to see how the advent of systems that provide more consistent pulsatile insu- lin infusions as well as smarter insulins affects the incidence of chronic complications potentially shedding new light on pathways leading to complications.Energy generation and metabolic flux of nutrients a newcomerEnergy generation There is increasing evidence that organs which are highly metabolic are most at risk for the develop- ment of complications  .

Other novel approaches to study heritability of diabetes complications cur- rently in their infancy include zebrafish models the Collaborative Cross gene mine   and organoid cultures from diseased tissues.Gene expression epigenetics and non-coding RNAsEpigenetic changes defined as reversible changes that are heritable affecting gene expression without altering the DNA sequence  may explain the proportion of heritable risk for vascular complications not accounted for by GWAS and candidate gene studies.

This could limit our understanding of how genes and other pathways interact at various sites stressing the need for longitudinal studies of complications in human tissues beginning much earlier in disease.Environmental interactions diet bugs and the immune systemWith obesity a major comorbidity and increased nutrient flux at sites postulated as a pathogenic mediator it is no surprise that diet has gained attention as a means to alter the develop- ment and progression of diabetes complications .

However the interplay between gut microbiota and sites vulnerable to dia- betic vascular complications remains to be experimentally untangled.Not surprisingly the immune system is dysregulated by diabetes where chronic tissue infiltration by leucocytes and sustained production of inflammatory mediators and cyto- kines are commonly seen at sites of complications .

The iden- tification of a number of synergistic accelerators of disease providing therapeutic pathways has stabilised the incidence of complications in most western nations.
