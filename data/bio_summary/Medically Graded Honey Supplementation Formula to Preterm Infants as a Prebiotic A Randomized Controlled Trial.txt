birth weight was measured just after delivery on a calibrated scale after daily zero adjustment the length of the newborn was measured with the subject in the supine position and the head in contact with a fixed board while the angles were gently held to extend the legs head circumference was determined by applying a measurement tape around the head over the glabella and supraorbital ridges anteriorly and the occiput so that the maximal circumference can be recorded randomizationusing opaque sealed envelopes subjects were randomized into 4 intervention groups group a received 5 g of bee honey suspension daily for 2 weeks group b received 10 g of bee honey suspension daily for 2 weeks group c received 15 g of bee honey suspension daily for 2 weeks and group d included control subjects who received regular feeding without any modifications.

after reaching 12 goal enteral feeds medically graded bee honey was added to milk at a dose of 5 10 15 and 0 gday for 2 weeks in groups a b c and d respectively.

this finding was similar to a recent meta-analysis that showed no effect on the linear growth when gosfos were added to preterm formula however an effect was present when fos was used alone our study also showed that the intervention groups had a greater increase in head circumference than the control group.

this effect was even more pronounced in the groups of infants who received 10 and 15 g day but was not significant in infants who received 5 gday group a. thus the increased dose of honey is more efficacious in establishing this prebiotic effect.

none of the managing team was aware of the group assignment of the infant.

pathology and micro- biology personnel were not aware of the group assignment at the time of assays.feedinginfants were fed cow's protein- based premature formula 80 cal100 ml as requested by parents.

paired t test was used to compare repeated measures within the same group.
