Head circumference increased significantly in groups B and C when compared to group D after 2 weeks P 0.0056 1.CD4 and CD8 concentrations ngdL did not differ among groups at enrollment or after 2 weeks of randomization 2.

Birth weight was measured just after delivery on a calibrated scale after daily zero adjustment The length of the newborn was measured with the subject in the supine position and the head in contact with a fixed board while the angles were gently held to extend the legs Head circumference was determined by applying a measurement tape around the head over the glabella and supraorbital ridges anteriorly and the occiput so that the maximal circumference can be recorded RandomizationUsing opaque sealed envelopes subjects were randomized into 4 intervention groups group A received 5 g of bee honey suspension daily for 2 weeks group B received 10 g of bee honey suspension daily for 2 weeks group C received 15 g of bee honey suspension daily for 2 weeks and group D included control subjects who received regular feeding without any modifications.

Compared to control group groups B and C had significant increase in weight after 1 week P  0.0001 and groups A B and C had significant weight increase by 2 weeks P  0.0001.

After 2 weeks only groups A and B continued to have less growth in colonies comparedto group D P 0.002 2.Bifidobacterium bifidum colony count by culture did not differ among the 4 groups at baseline.

After 1 week colony counts in groups A B and C did not differ from group D. After 2 weeks all 3 groups A B and C had significantly greater colony growth compared to group D P 14 0.002.

For lactobacilli there was no difference among groups at enrollment with increased growth in groups B and C when compared to group D 112.6 - 142.9 and 53.3 - 26.1 vs -4.1 - 8.5 respectively P 14 0.013 after 1 week and in group C compared to group D after 2 weeks 1718.4 - 1434 vs -6.4 - 7.6 P  0.0001.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrated the introduction of medi-1.60.80Group AGroup BGroup CGroup DGroup AGroup BGroup CGroup Dcally graded honey to cow's milk formula was associated withchanges in microbiota of stool in premature infants.

Upper panel represents changes in weight a compared to the control group groups B and C had significant increase in weight after 1 week P  0.0001 and b com- pared to the control group groups A B and C had significant weight increase after 2 weeks P  0.0001.

Upper panel represents changes in Enterobacteriaceae a after 1 week of intervention a significant decrease in colony count was recognized in the 3 intervention groups A B and C P  0.0001 and b after 2 weeks only groups A and B continued to have less growth in colonies compared to group D P 14 0.002.

Enterobacter stool colonization decreased in groups A and B P 14 0.002 whereas Bifidobacterium bifidum colony counts increased in groups A B and C P 14 0.002 and lactobacilli colony counts increased in group B P  0.0001.
