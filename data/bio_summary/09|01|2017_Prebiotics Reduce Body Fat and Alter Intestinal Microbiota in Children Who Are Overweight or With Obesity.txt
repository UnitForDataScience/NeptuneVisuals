when assessing correlations with change in bodycomposition changes in body weight rs 0.414 p .012 fat mass rs 0.358 p .032 and bmi rs 0.373 p .025 were significantly and positively correlated with changes in otu2559 representing clostridium clostridioforme and change in trunk body fat was significantly and positively correlated with change in bacteroides vulgatus otu2492 rs 0.494 p .002 and change in bacterium mpn-isolate otu1554 rs 0.394 p .017. change in otu2559 was also significantly and positively correlated with changes in il-6 rs 0.657 p .0001 whereas change in serum tri- glycerides was significantly and positively correlated withtable 3. changes in fecal bile acids assessed using hplc in children 7-12 years with overweight and obesity consuming oi prebiotic or placebo for 16 weeksprebioticsplacebooutcome mmolgwithin groupwithin group between groupsdry fecesinitialfinalp valueinitialfinalp valuep valueabbreviations oi oligofructose-enriched inulin ca cholic acid cdca chenodeoxycholic acid dca deoxycholic acid lca lithocholic acid hdca hyodeoxycholic acid udca ursodeoxycholic acid cdca proportion of cdca to total fecal bile acids.avalues are mean - sem n1416 for prebiotic and n1413 for placebo.table 4. within-group changes of microbial abundance assessed using illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing in children 7-12 years with overweight and obesity consuming oi prebiotic or placebo for 16 weeksmean  bacterial abundance - sd prebioticsplacebonote.

age and sex-specific analysis of body weight showed significant decreases in body weight z-score within the prebiotic group p .006. the interac- tion of treatment and time significantly influenced bmi p .009 whereby there was no change in bmi within the prebiotic group compared with baseline but at all 4 time points compared with baseline bmi significantly increased in the placebo group supplementary figure 2. percent total body fat was significantly lower with oi compared with placebo p .005 .

these promising outcomes in adults justify the assessment of prebiotics as a dietary intervention to modulate gut microbiota and metabolic outcomes in pedi- atric obesity.excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adult- hood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality highlighting the importance of early intervention.the potential for prebiotics to influ- ence body weight in children was suggested by the slowed rate of weight gain observed in a trial assessing combined prebiotic and calcium intake in non-obese healthy chil- dren.to date however there is no research assessing the totality of changes in gut microbiota in children with overweight and obesity with prebiotic intervention.

the normalization of absolute body weight gain with oi is important because it allowed children to meet and not exceed expected growth trends.this normalization may be attributed in part to the improved appetite control we previously demonstrated in the oi group.in the present study the reduction in percent body fat observed in the subjects consuming oi was similarly observed by abrams et alas a reduction in total fat mass in normal weight and overweight children consuming 8 g of oi with supplemental calcium for a year.

results after 16 weeks children who consumed oi had significant decreases in body weight z-score decrease of 3.1 percent body fat decrease of 2.4 and percent trunk fat decrease of 3.8 compared with children given placebo increase of 0.5 increase of 0.05 and decrease of 0.3 respectively.

however height and weight are expected to increase linearly in children 6-10 years old with little difference between the sexes in particular body weight is expected to increase 2-3 kg annually.based on our 4-month intervention data the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kg within the expected range whereasthe projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kg almost triple the expected yearly increase.

in healthy normal-weight adults there was no change in cytokines following prebiotic intake likely because base- line levels were not elevated enough to detect differ- ences.this is likely the case in our subjects as well given that il-6 was the only cytokine significantly reduced with prebiotic and greater inflammation is typically needed to see a treatment response.we did observe a trend to- ward a reduction in metabolic endotoxemia which is consistent with reduced lps seen with inulin-type fructan intake in otherwise healthy obese adults healthy normal weight adults and overweight and obese women with t2d.-microbial metabolites such as fbas are 1 potential mechanism through which changes in gut microbiota composition impact host physiology.increased primary fbas have been associated with negative clinical outcomes including diarrhea-prominent irritable bowel syndrome which was associated with a significant decrease in bifido- bacterium.of relevance to obesity increased serum levels of the primary ba cdca relative to total bas cdca was seen in obesity with t2d  obesity  overweight  healthy control.there was also a positive correlation between cdca and bmi hba1c ldl-cholesterol and tri- glycerides.in our participants no change in fecal cdca was seen in the oi group albeit a numerical but not sig- nificant decrease but there was a significant 17 increase in the placebo group over time.

regional body fat assessment showed significant decreases in percent trunk fat within the prebi- otic group p 14 .019 and significant differences between the groups p 14 .029. percent android fat tended to be reduced in prebiotic vs placebo p 14 .055.prebiotics induced marginal changes in systemic inflammationthere was little change in the serum inflammatory profile within the prebiotic and placebo groups supplementary table 1. although there was a 31 decrease in serum c-reactive protein in the prebiotic group and an 8 increase in the placebo group this was not significantly different.

this result is consistent with a cross-sectional study in india showing increased f prausnitzii abundance in children with obesity compared with non-obese children with qpcrand more recently with illumina sequencing showing 20 higher abundance of f prausnitzii in italian children with obesity compared with normal-weightincluding a posi- tive correlation of bmi z-score with faecalibacterium.

our participants were also otherwise healthy overweight and obese children and therefore future studies should also include a pediatric population with greater metabolic dysfunction to more fully understand how geno- type and environment affect the relationship between the host and the gut microbiome.lastly many children in the study did not have regular bowel movements therefore our stool collection at baseline and final test days could not be tightly controlled eg time of day 24-hour collection which could affect the concentrations of some fecal metab- olites such as fbas.in conclusion supplementation with oi improved obesity outcomes in children with overweightobesity.
