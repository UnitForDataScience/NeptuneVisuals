When assessing correlations with change in bodycomposition changes in body weight rs 0.414 P .012 fat mass rs 0.358 P .032 and BMI rs 0.373 P .025 were significantly and positively correlated with changes in OTU2559 representing Clostridium clostridioforme and change in trunk body fat was significantly and positively correlated with change in Bacteroides vulgatus OTU2492 rs 0.494 P .002 and change in bacterium mpn-isolate OTU1554 rs 0.394 P .017.

Age and sex-specific analysis of body weight showed significant decreases in body weight z-score within the prebiotic group P .006.

In healthy normal-weight adults there was no change in cytokines following prebiotic intake likely because base- line levels were not elevated enough to detect differ- ences.This is likely the case in our subjects as well given that IL-6 was the only cytokine significantly reduced with prebiotic and greater inflammation is typically needed to see a treatment response.We did observe a trend to- ward a reduction in metabolic endotoxemia which is consistent with reduced LPS seen with inulin-type fructan intake in otherwise healthy obese adults healthy normal weight adults and overweight and obese women with T2D.-Microbial metabolites such as FBAs are 1 potential mechanism through which changes in gut microbiota composition impact host physiology.Increased primary FBAs have been associated with negative clinical outcomes including diarrhea-prominent irritable bowel syndrome which was associated with a significant decrease in Bifido- bacterium.Of relevance to obesity increased serum levels of the primary BA CDCA relative to total BAs CDCA was seen in obesity with T2D  obesity  overweight  healthy control.There was also a positive correlation between CDCA and BMI HbA1c LDL-cholesterol and tri- glycerides.In our participants no change in fecal CDCA was seen in the OI group albeit a numerical but not sig- nificant decrease but there was a significant 17 increase in the placebo group over time.

However height and weight are expected to increase linearly in children 6-10 years old with little difference between the sexes in particular body weight is expected to increase 2-3 kg annually.Based on our 4-month intervention data the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kg within the expected range whereasthe projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kg almost triple the expected yearly increase.

These promising outcomes in adults justify the assessment of prebiotics as a dietary intervention to modulate gut microbiota and metabolic outcomes in pedi- atric obesity.Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adult- hood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality highlighting the importance of early intervention.The potential for prebiotics to influ- ence body weight in children was suggested by the slowed rate of weight gain observed in a trial assessing combined prebiotic and calcium intake in non-obese healthy chil- dren.To date however there is no research assessing the totality of changes in gut microbiota in children with overweight and obesity with prebiotic intervention.

Regional body fat assessment showed significant decreases in percent trunk fat within the prebi- otic group P 14 .019 and significant differences between the groups P 14 .029.

The normalization of absolute body weight gain with OI is important because it allowed children to meet and not exceed expected growth trends.This normalization may be attributed in part to the improved appetite control we previously demonstrated in the OI group.In the present study the reduction in percent body fat observed in the subjects consuming OI was similarly observed by Abrams et alas a reduction in total fat mass in normal weight and overweight children consuming 8 g of OI with supplemental calcium for a year.

Exclusion criteria included type 1 or 2 diabetes liver disease cardiovascular abnormal- ities supplement or medication use influencing appetite weight or metabolism currently following a weight loss diet 3 kg weight loss 12 weeks before the initial test day extreme changes in exercise intensity 4 weeks prior or anti- biotic use  3 months prior.This study which was powered on the primary objective of reduction in percent body fat with 80 power and a .05 required a minimum of 18 subjects per group.An additional 4 subjects were added per group to compensate for a potential 20 drop-out rate.Ethics approval was received from the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary REB13-0975.

RESULTS After 16 weeks children who consumed OI had significant decreases in body weight z-score decrease of 3.1 percent body fat decrease of 2.4 and percent trunk fat decrease of 3.8 compared with children given placebo increase of 0.5 increase of 0.05 and decrease of 0.3 respectively.
