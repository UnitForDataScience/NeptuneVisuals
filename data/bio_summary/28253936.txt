The method does not rely on a comprehensive evaluation of the metagenome and metaproteome data but rather utilizes both to simplify the discovery of proteins exhibiting a desired enzyme activity.Metaproteomics is quickly becoming a well-established high-throughput meta-omic approach to study microbial ecology as recently reviewed in and .

The sequenced raw data was assembled to recover original genome information and to predict proteins using the assembly software SPAdes v3.1.1  and annotated using PROKKA v1.10 .

To verify the biocatalytic activity of the uncharacterized hydrolase ML-005 its DNA sequence was synthetized based on the metagenome data and cloned into Escheri- chia coli in an IPTG-inducible pBR322 -based expressionvector with a tac promotor.

After separation proteins were refolded in the gel and an in-gel activity assay based on the fluorogenic lipase substrate para-methylumbelliferyl butyrate pMUBwas performed.

The obtained database contained approximately 161000 proteins of which 37.6 were annotated as hypothetical proteins with un- known function.This customized database was then used to analyze the mass spectra obtained from the 14 lipolytically active protein spots Additional file Table S1.
