animal studies may help to validate the initial reports that combined plasma citrulline i-fabp and i-babp levels can be used to evaluate cim following myeloablative chemotherapy 45.cytokines and inflammatory markers play key roles in thepathogenesis of mucositis and elevated serum levels of proin- flammatory cytokines such as tnf il-1f3 and il-6 and acute phase reactants such as crp are markers of the inflammatory response induced by various chemotherapeutic agents but can- not be considered specific for mucositis 65 111. still in- creased crp levels may correlate closely with severity of intestinal damage in both humans 19 and piglets 166 167. other cytokines such as il-1 il-17a and il-8 may also reflect the inflammatory response related to git toxicity 9 149 203. furthermore the pretreatment levels of inflamma- tory mediators may predict the later risk of cim during treatment 218. although git toxicity and the systemic in- flammatory response after chemotherapy are connected plasma cytokine and inflammatory marker levels are not effec- tive biomarkers of cim because they may be secreted by multiple tissue sites and cell types in the entire organism in a highly time-dependent manner 111. this lack of specificity of cytokine levels has been confirmed in pig studies where dif- ferent git toxicity levels did not correlate well with circulating or git tissue cytokine levels 150 166 167.increased intestinal permeability induced by chemotherapyis an essential aspect of im and it is related to the inflamma- tory and infectious complications associated with toxicity 21 99 132. different sugar permeability tests have been used to assess intestinal barrier function in clinical studies although the required fasting period and collection of blood or urine over an extended time period limit the clinical feasibility of the test 65. regardless animal studies in both pigs and rats haveg238animal models of chemotherapy-induced mucositisconfirmed that the intestinal permeability to sugars is an effective way to assess this aspect of cim 150 167 188. direct chemotherapy-related damage to the nutrient absorptive capacity is reported but the evidence is weaker than for intestinal permeability.

in adult oncology at least 20 -50 of patients receiving standard dose chemotherapy develop om with a frequency and severity of symptoms highly dependent on the type and dose of chemotherapy and the scoring system used to evaluate mucositis 164 170 171. the responses to different antineo- plastic drugs may be age dependent and both lower and higher incidences have been reported in pediatric oncology 57 133 154. higher incidences in children may be explained by the frequent use of high-dose multidrug regimens for this popu- lation 6 164. among drugs commonly associated with om in children are alkylating agents such as busulfan and cyclophos- phamide antimetabolites such as methotrexate 5-fu and capecitabine and anthracyclines such as doxorubicin 6 154 164. as in adults the risk of im has received less attention compared with om but studies indicate that im is present in 30 - 60 of children receiving chemotherapy 110 154. con- sidering the challenges in accurately assessing cim in humansanimal models of chemotherapy-induced mucositisg237especially im the use of biomarkers is critical for more accurate diagnosis or to supplement clinical assessments 111. chemotherapy generally causes shortening of the villi with continued migration and cell sloughing while mitosis is re- duced leading to marked changes in the steady state of the epithelium 93. time-dependent villous atrophy is associated with cim in both rodents and piglets and examining intestinal morphology is highly relevant in preclinical models 95 150. chemotherapy may also induce other histopathological signs of damage and several scoring systems incorporate these 44 211. furthermore the relative proportions of various brush border enzyme activities throughout the small intestine can be used to reflect mucosal digestive function 150 167. animal studies have documented chemotherapy-induced increase in tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines 76 123 148 damage to tight junction proteins and intestinal integrity 132 and impaired nutrient absorption 60. in a few human studies the lactose and sucrose breath tests have been used to assess mucosal digestive function but the tests are unlikely to be sensitive and specific enough for wide application as biomark- ers of cim in clinical practice 111. animal studies using rodents and pigs would help to further validate these biomarker tests based on disaccharide digestion 60 167. chemotherapy may directly or indirectly also affect git motility and the associated enteric nervous system both short and long term 50 131. measures of gastric emptying rate and intestinal transit time can be obtained from both patients and animal models but only animal models allow detailed analyses of the structural and functional damage to the enteric nervous system that may lead to dysmotility constipation andor diarrhea 176. this is an overlooked research area and animal models with a great similarity to humans in their git enteric nervous system and motility patterns are required to study this in moredetail.the relation between chemotherapy neutropenia cim and infections in cancer patients is well recognized and antibiotics treatment is critical for survival 160. cim severity correlates closely with infection sensitivity indicating that cim directly increases systemic infections 49 83 172. the systemic immune dysfunction induced by chemotherapy increases the risk of infections with bacteremia occurring when wbc counts are lowest and coinciding with a peak in cim 19 65 82 83 196. cim may disrupt the barrier functions of the intestine and some infectious complications appear to be related to the resident oral and gut microbiota translocating to the bloodstream 40 64 82 134. thus commensal bacteria detected in the bloodstream such as the coagulase-negative staphylococci may originate not only from skin surfaces but also from mucosal sources in the git 40. the role of the gut microbiota in these inflammatory cim responses may be most important after the initial apoptotic phase as demonstrated in doxorubicin-treated germ-free mice 156 and show the rele- vance of interventions that manipulate the gut microbiota.

toll-like receptors specifically tlr2 tlr4 and tlr9 63 95 184 207 and tight junction proteins with consequences for intestinal barrier function 18 76. in relation to cim increased release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1f3 il-1f3 tumor necrosis fac- tor tnf and interleukin-6 il-6 76 122 123 is mediated partly by early upregulation of nf-kb and possibly maintained by further nf-kb activation and activation of injury pathways 5. the matrix metallopeptidases and their regulators 2 5 28 are also important and kruppel-like factors specifically klf-4 are known to be involved in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis 180 181. the chemokines belonging to the cxc motif ligand family and their receptors 77 126 as well as bone morphogenic proteins involved in epithelial- mesenchymal signaling and intestinal stem cell activity 42 have also been implicated in cim pathophysiology.
