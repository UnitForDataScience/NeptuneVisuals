In this way also complex microbial communities can be characterized in a simple and rapid way  and the state and dynamics of these communities interpreted as marker for healthy and disturbed ecosystems  .In the following sub-chapters the general procedure of micro- bial flow cytometry and cytometric fingerprinting is described including routine laboratory as well as data analysis procedures which are also applicable to human associated microbial samples.Microbial flow cytometryMost microbial samples are suitable for cytometric character- ization and an established step-by-step protocol with several var- iants for specific sample requirements e.g.

Altogether there are no methodological limitations regarding data analysis and the result matrices can be introduced into established routines available for microbial ecology.Cell sortingSegregated microbial community data in combination with a functional interpretation can be used to identify the functional relevant subcommunities in a microbial community.

In this way the cytometric mea- surement represents a specific cytometric fingerprint of a particular microbial community structure at the time point of sampling representing the variety of cells with different optical characteris- tics as well as their abundance and being representative of the state of the microbial community.

These differences can be further visualized with multidimensional scaling to decipher general trends in the community dynamics  G. While the dissimi- larity value between two samples does not represent the source of the difference being either the result of many small differences over the complete microbial community or a drastic change in a single subcommunity this question can be answered with segre- gated analysis provided by other analyzing tools.Segregated microbial community analysis is realized with flowCyBar .

The routine procedure for microbial flow cytometry is widely applicable and comprises the following steps A Sampling of the microbial community.

Therefore microbial community cytometry may become increasingly comparable and competitive for routine diagnostics as the method can easily provide summation records on dynamic trends in community evolution while being inexpensiveand rapid in application.While a wide range of measures for the diversity of microbial communities is at hand e.g.

With the growing demand for on-time community assessment and monitoring of its dynamic behavior with high resolution alternative high-throughput methods such as microbial com- munity flow cytometry come into focus.
