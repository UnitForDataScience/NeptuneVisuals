Neither were any statistically significant differences seen between observations before and after LAB and sham runs respectively.The patients' general experience of the treatmentsLAB and sham was as follows 5 patients listed decreased nasal problems when using the nasal sprays whereof 3 were in the LAB run and 2 in the sham run 3 recorded a burning sensation in the nose after LAB sham administration 1 in the LAB run and 2 for both the LAB and the sham runs 4 reported diffuse stomach problems 3 in the sham run and 1 for both the LAB and the sham runs 3 reported coughing 1 in the LAB and 1 in the sham run and 1 for both the LAB and the sham runs 2 patients reported a minor nose-bleed 1 in the sham run and 1 in both the sham and the LAB runs.

Statistically significant differences were seen neither between LAB and sham p 5 0.082 nor between observations before and after LAB p 5 0.862 and sham p 5 0.577 respectively.For the SNOT-22 rhinology domain the median score for all observations prior to administration of LAB and sham was 18.0 IQR 12.5-24.0.

Statistically significant differences were neither seen between LAB and sham p 5 0.082 nor between observations before and after LAB p 5 0.862 and sham p 5 0.577 respectively.

The comparative analysis focused first on observation after LAB compared with sham and second on observation before and after LAB and sham respectively using the Friedman test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Statistically significant differences were seen neither between LAB and sham p 5 0.061 nor between observations before and after LAB p 5 0.471 and sham p 5 0.992 respectively.Fifty-two bacterial species were identified in the study.

Statistically sig- nificant differences were neither seen between LAB and sham p 5 0.061 nor between observations before and after LAB p 5 0.471 and sham p 5 0.992 respectively.

Statistically significant differences were neither seen between LAB and sham p 5 0.097 nor between observations before and after LAB p 5 0.219 and sham p 5 0.263 respectively.

The differ- ences in bacterial composition between observations before and after LAB treatment and sham were not sig- nificant p 5 0.219 and p 5 0.263 respectively.IL-6 IL-8 IFN-c TNF-a and MPO were measured in the nasal lavage fluid samples before and after the LAB and sham runs.

Statistically significant differences were not seen between LAB or sham p-values for the LAB versus sham calculations are indicated in Figure 3.

No differences were observed when comparing the level of these markers between LAB and sham or when com- paring levels before and after treatment with LAB and sham respectively suggesting that the treatment hadno effect on the process of inflammation that character- ises CRSCRSsNP.The strength of this study lies foremost in the cross- over design that allows for paired comparisons.
