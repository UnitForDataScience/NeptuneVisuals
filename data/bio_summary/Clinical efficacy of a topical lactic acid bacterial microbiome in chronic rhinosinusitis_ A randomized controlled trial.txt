individual data are indicated in figure 3. statistically significant differences were not seen between lab or sham p-values for the lab versus sham calculations are indicated in figure 3. neither were any statistically significant differences seen between observations before and after lab and sham runs respectively.the patients' general experience of the treatmentslab and sham was as follows 5 patients listed decreased nasal problems when using the nasal sprays whereof 3 were in the lab run and 2 in the sham run 3 recorded a burning sensation in the nose after lab sham administration 1 in the lab run and 2 for both the lab and the sham runs 4 reported diffuse stomach problems 3 in the sham run and 1 for both the lab and the sham runs 3 reported coughing 1 in the lab and 1 in the sham run and 1 for both the lab and the sham runs 2 patients reported a minor nose-bleed 1 in the sham run and 1 in both the sham and the lab runs.

individual data are indicated in figure 1. statistically significant differences were seen neither between lab and sham p 5 0.082 nor between observations before and after lab p 5 0.862 and sham p 5 0.577 respectively.for the snot-22 rhinology domain the median score for all observations prior to administration of lab and sham was 18.0 iqr 12.5-24.0. the scores after 2 weeks' administration of lab and sham were 19.0 iqr 15-285 and 17.5 iqr 9.0-23 respectively.

in addition we study if the intervention affects commensal bacteria or the inflammatory milieu in the nasal cavity as assessed by nasal lavage fluid analyses of select cytokinesmediators.materials and methodsstudy designthe study was of a randomized double-blinded crossover and sham-controlled design in which a mixture of 9 lactobacilli and 4 bifidobacteria lab was examined against sham as a topical nasal spray 2 weeks' treatment for crssnp focusing on patient-assessment snot-22 questionnaire i.e.

again am repeated the examination the nasal endoscopy and the sampling as in visit 1. finally a nasal lavage was performed.after a washout period of at least 4 weeks the patients returned to the clinic and the abovementioned procedures and interventions were repeated in the same order thereby consti- tuting visits 3-4. this time subjects who received nasal spray containing lab in the first run now were subjected to sham and vice versa.lab formulation and administrationthe formulation comprised 13 honeybee lab species lac- tobacillus apinorum fhon13n lactobacillus mellifer bin4n lactobacillus mellis hon2n lactobacillus kimbladii hma2n lactobacillus melliventris hma8n lactobacillus helsingborgen- sis bma5n lactobacillus kullabergensis biut2n lactobacillus kunkeei fhon2n lactobacillus apis hma11n bifidobacterium asteroides bin2n bifidobacterium coryneforme bma6n bifido- bacterium bin7n and bifidobacterium hma3n.10-12the initial concentration of each lab was 108 cfuml and the matrix was swedish sterilized heather honey 93 and bee-pollen in water 7. honey and bee pollen were used as nutrients and to stimulate the microbiota to produce bioactive metabolites.913 a spray solution was obtained by mixing the abovementioned solution with sterile water 5 g10 ml.

results are indicated in table i. the differ- ences in bacterial composition between observations before and after lab treatment and sham were not sig- nificant p 5 0.219 and p 5 0.263 respectively.il-6 il-8 ifn-c tnf-a and mpo were measured in the nasal lavage fluid samples before and after the lab and sham runs.

a nasal lavage was performed.the subjects were then given two bottles of nasal spray marked 1 and 2 same content in both bottles containing either lab or sham solution instructed on how to store and administer the spray and administered the first dose under supervision of study personnel.

inclusion criteria were two nasal symptoms for more than 12 weeks one of which was nasal obstruction or discoloured dis- charge in addition to disease verification by endoscopy or ct scan according to the definition determined in the 2012 epos guidelines.1 specific exclusion criteria were nasal polyposis and treatment with antibiotics within a period of 14 days prior to inclusion.

bacterial activity was found to be slightly lower than the fresh bottle yet still very high.snot-22 questionnairethe snot-22 questionnaire comprises 22 questions rele- vant to the symptomatology and morbidity of upper respiratory tract conditions.14 individual scores are produced and added to a total score range 0-110. eight specific questions make up a rhinology domain of the test range 0-40. these questions are of relevance to need to blow the nose sneezes running nose cough nasal secretion going into the throat thick nasal secre- tions difficulty to sense smellstastes and stuffed nose and are thought to relate directly to nasal symptoms.e-swab handling and microbiological analysise-swab samples from visit 1 2 3 and 4 were diluted 110 and 1100 with phosphate buffered saline ph 7.2 and cultured on blood chocolate fastidious anaerobe agar faa and supple- mented mrs. blood and chocolate agar plates were incubated aerobically for 24 hours at 378c and faa plates anaerobically for 48 hours at 378c.

statistically significant differences were neither seen between lab and sham p 5 0.082 nor between observations before and after lab p 5 0.862 and sham p 5 0.577 respectively.

the comparative analysis focused first on observation after lab compared with sham and second on observation before and after lab and sham respectively using the friedman test and the wilcoxon signed rank test.

both patients were kept in the intention to treat analysis.the median snot-22 score for all observations prior to administration of lab and sham was 45.5 iqr 23.0-58.5. the scores after two weeks' administration of lab and sham were 38.0 iqr 28.0-68.5 and 34.0 iqr 17-55 respectively.

individual data are indicated in figure 2. statistically significant differences were seen neither between lab and sham p 5 0.061 nor between observations before and after lab p 5 0.471 and sham p 5 0.992 respectively.fifty-two bacterial species were identified in the study.

statistically sig- nificant differences were neither seen between lab and sham p 5 0.061 nor between observations before and after lab p 5 0.471 and sham p 5 0.992 respectively.

statistically significant differences were neither seen between lab and sham p 5 0.097 nor between observations before and after lab p 5 0.219 and sham p 5 0.263 respectively.

no differences were observed when comparing the level of these markers between lab and sham or when com- paring levels before and after treatment with lab and sham respectively suggesting that the treatment hadno effect on the process of inflammation that character- ises crscrssnp.the strength of this study lies foremost in the cross- over design that allows for paired comparisons.
