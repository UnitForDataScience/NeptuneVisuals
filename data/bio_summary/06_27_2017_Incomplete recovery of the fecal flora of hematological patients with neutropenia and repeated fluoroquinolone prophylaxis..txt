In fact QR E. coli were detected frequently in the blood isolates after quinolone prophylaxis in the highly endemic area of these bacteria.1718 The detection rates of ESBL-producing E. coli most of which are resistant to quinolones vary across the world.19 The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli has been increasing in Japan not only in the hospitals but also in the community.2021 Therefore the emergence of QR E. coli after quinolone prophylaxis may be found more frequently in the other regions of Japan than in our region.Based on the above-mentioned consideration the emer-gence of QR Enterococci after prophylaxis may be also due to the enrichment of the QR Enterococcus subpopulation already present in the initial gut flora.

de Lastours et al demonstrated that quinolone exposure didnot induce resistant mutations on the quinolone-resistance- determining region QRDR genes eg gyrA or parC of the same E. coli clones.13 The researchers have presumed the two following possibilities based on this result first the newly emergent QR E. coli strains after quinolone exposure were present at undetectable levels and second the exogenous acquisition of QR E. coli strains occurred.

Thus in any case the most relevant factor for the detection of QR E. coli includ- ing ESBL-producing E. coli seems to be the level of the endemic spread of QR E. coli.

Of the patients receiving multiple prophylactic courses six had QR Escherichia coli including extended-spectrum b-lactamase ESBL producers at the first course and four 66.3 of the six patients had persistent detec- tion of QR E. coli at the second course.Conclusion In patients receiving multiple courses of prophylactic quinolone along with a common chemotherapy schedule newly emergent resistant bacteria could be frequently per- sistent in their fecal flora.Keywords febrile neutropenia prophylaxis fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance fecal flora chemotherapyIntroductionFebrile neutropenia is one of the most serious adverse events in patients with hemato- logical malignancies and chemotherapy.1 Bacteremia related to febrile neutropenia often increases infection-related morbidity and mortality.

Of the seven patients six had QR E. coli including QR ESBL-producing E. coli before andor after the first prophylaxis.

37 QR ESBL-producing E. coli isolated before the first prophylaxis were not detected after the first prophylaxis followed by reemergence before the second prophylaxis.DiscussionIn the previous study11 we concluded that quinolone prophy- laxis did not significantly increase QR E. coli while in the current study a significant increase in quinolone resistance was observed.

It has been reported by metagenome analysis that the composition of human gut microbiota may not completely recover even after 6 months from the initial quinolone exposure.14In the previous report of this study we showed the most frequency of 5 in the emergence of QR E. coli after quino- lone prophylaxis.11 In contrast in the studies conducted by European institutes the detection rates of QR E. coli after quinolone prophylaxis were 30.1516 Quinolone exposure in healthy volunteers also showed the new emergence of QRE.

We focused on the decrease of QS Enterobacteriaceae and the dominant emergence of QR coagulase negative staphylococci CNS and QR Enterococcus QR CNS and Enterococcus species as a characteristic of the change of bacterial com- position in feces before and after quinolone exposure.

Thus the spread of resistant bacteria particularly QR E. coli including ESBL-producers and QR Enterococci including VRE as a local factor may influence strategies toward the use of quinolone prophylaxis.
