to- gether these data suggest that microbiota in the oral cavity and not in the colon play an important role in the mono- clonal proliferation of vg6 gdt17 cells leading to systemic expansion of gdt17 cells.microbiota exchange induces gdt17 proliferation in the clns resulting in systemic expansionto examine the influence of microbiota on the periph- eral regulation of gdt17 cells without affecting thedevelopment of mucosal immunity we co-housed ani- mals together  wt mice were co-housed with il-17r-- mice for 10 weeks after weaning.

in contrast vg6 gdt17 stop developing in the thymus during embryogenesis and are maintained in the periphery as a self-replicating stem cell-like population  development and traf- ficking aside the regulation and maintenance of gdt17 cells in the periphery either through internal self- propagating mechanisms or indirect external players are still poorly understood.well-known gdt17 regulation primarily centers ondirect and indirect innate processes including cytokine stimulation pathogen-associated molecular pattern pamp recognition and complement receptor activa- tion.

gdt17 cells proliferate in response to various cyto- kines such as il-1b and il-7 gdt17 can use pamp receptors such as tlr2 for the induction of il- 17 responses further supporting innate-like characteris- tics sepsis induction of c5a secretion resulted in dc-gdt17 crosstalk resulting in il-17 production through a cytokine-dependent mechanism involving il-6 and tgf-b collectively these studies suggest that gdt17 cells can be proliferated and expanded upon cyto- kine stimulation.

these data indicate that microbiota under homeostatic conditions do in fact modulate the prolifer- ation and expansion of gdt17 cells.discussionin this study we demonstrate that gdt17 cells are regu- lated through modulation of the microbiota with drastic systemic changes in gdt17 frequency and il-17- producing capabilities.

this peripheral regulation network is initiated presumably at the mucosal sur- face and through cd103cd11cdc activation which leads to vg6 gdt17 proliferation in the draining clns and subsequently to systemic expansion in tissues such as the lungs skin and spleen but not in the colon or mlns.previous studies have shown the ability of microbiota to influence the expansion of gdt17 cells here we show that the expansion of gdt17 cells is transferred between mouse strains simply by co-housing wt andil-17r-- mice.

we also ob- served a correlating drop in the cd103cd11cdc population in the clns in the absence of microbiota supporting our hypothesis that microbiota-regulated cd103cd11cdcs play a role in the maintenance and expansion of vg6 gdt17 cells.dc cross talk with gdt17 cells using cytokines il-1band il-23 to induce proliferation and il-17 production during inflammatory settings has been well described our ex vivo depletion and co-culture studies were designed to determine what led to the proliferation of gdt17 cells in il-17r-- mice during steady-state condi- tions.

further investigation will be needed to determine through what mechanism-activated cd103 dcs induce gdt17 proliferation.one of the most confusing issues in gdt17 biology hasbeen what events are needed for gdt17 activation and cytokine secretion while some gd t cells respond- ing to ag stimulation in the periphery and undergoing ag-specific differentiation into il-17a-producing cells such as phycoerythrin pe-specific gd t cell response other gd t cells make il-17 within hours after an immune challenge.

principal coordinate analysis of unweighted unifrac distance matrix showed differential clustering for wt and il-17r-- mice.results we found drastic homeostatic expansion of gdt17 in all major tissues most prominently in cervical lymph nodes clns with monoclonal expansion of vg6 gdt17 in il-17r-- mice.

however microbiota transfer using fecal transplant through oral gavage to bypass the oral cavity showed no difference in colon or systemic gdt17 expansion.conclusions these findings reveal for the first time that gdt17 cells are regulated by microbiota dysbiosis through cell-to-cell contact with activated cd103 dcs leading to drastic systemic monoclonal expansion.

however it is unknown whether gdt17 cells in the periphery require cell-to-cell contact with other immune cells for homeostasis as well as in- duction of il-17 secretion in response to tissue damage or microbial invasion.a recently discovered and ubiquitously located antigen- presenting cell apc located at the same epithelial sur- faces as gdt17 cells are cd103 dendritic cells dcs.

during homeostasiscd103 dc endogenous activation of nearby gdt17 cells could be a major component of how our immune system maintains appropriate and healthy levels of microbiota at epithelial surfaces.in the current study we investigated how gdt17 cells are regulated during homeostasis especially in the ab- sence of il-17r signaling to and from the environment.

in antibiotic-induced microbiota-depleted aimd mice and germ-free gf mice we observed a major collapse of the gdt17 population and the quality of their il-17 responses specifically in the vg6 gdt17 cells.

clinically this new regulatory net- work could play an important role in numerous disease models that may lead to novel and effective immuno- therapies for a constantly expanding list of il-17-driven inflammatory diseases dominated by the presence of gdt17 cells.resultsgdt17 cell proliferation is peripherally regulated by the presence of il-17r signalingwe initially observed a drastic systemic expansion of total gd t cells particularly gdt17 cells in il-17r ko mice.
