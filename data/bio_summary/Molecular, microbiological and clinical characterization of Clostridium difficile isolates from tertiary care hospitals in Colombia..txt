A total of 69 92 of CDI patients recieved therapy for this dis- ease while five patients were discharged and one died before starting the specific treatment.About the laboratory data and clinical signs and symptoms CDI patients showed significant differences in white blood cell counts ileus abdominal pain nausea and vomit in comparison with those patients with negative C. difficile toxin .In addition 51 of the patients 394775 had a concomitant infection of these 143 36.3 had urinary tract and 97 24.6 bloodstream infections.

Of note a significant difference was observed between CDI patients staying in ICU before presenting the symptoms as com- pared to those negative for the C. difficile toxin in stools 29.3 versus 15 P  0.001.Furthermore analyses of comorbidities systems or organs affected risk factors death or improvement of the CDI patients as well as previous administration of antibiotics  showed significant differences on those CDI patients who have affected the musculoskeletal 21.3 versus 9.4 and genital 5.3 versus 0.7 systems or those who assisted to orthope- dic service 18.7 versus 5.6 as compared to those non-CDI patients.

Among the risk Laboratory data clinical signs and symptoms of those patients with and without stool toxin.White Blood Cell countsC-Reactive Protein CRPCDI C. difficile infectionfactors analyzed only steroid usage showed a significant difference between CDI and non- CDI patients 20 versus 35.7 P  0.006.The most frequently administered antibiotics during the six week period prior symptoms or toxin test were piperacillintazobactam administered to 440 56.7 patients followed by meropenem 245 31.6 vancomycin 190 24.5 ciprofloxacin 163 21.0 ampicillinsulbactam 150 19.3 metronidazole 135 17.4 clarithromycin 111 14.3 linezolid 91 11.7 and others at less than 10 each.

Among the different antibiotics used only third generation cephalosporin and macrolides showed a significant difference between CDI and non-CDI patients .Regarding the severity of the diseases 58 patients had mild-moderate CDI from these 30 51.7 patients received only oral metronidazole and 6 10.3 received both oral metronida- zole and vancomycin.

The frequency of CDI in each hospi- tal was 7.0 17.9 and 7.1 for hospitals A B and C respectively.Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with suspicion of CDI according to positive stool toxinSeveral clinical characteristics and laboratory data from patients with CDI or without non- CDI stool toxin were compared in a bivariade analysis Tables and .

Six patients had severe disease and two severe complicated and nine patients were not classified.

Moreover from 644 patients with diarrhea 8 1.2 had other pathogens as possible cause of diarrhea one of them had Salmonella enterica two Strongyloides stercolaris and 5 Entamoeba histolytica.The bivariate analysis to compare CDI versus non-CDI patients conduced to identify vari- ables associated with the development of CDI showed that staying in an orthopedic service OR 3.8 95 CI 2.0-7.56 or ICU OR 3.45 95 CI 1.8-6.42 administration of third-genera- tion cephalosporins OR 1.98 95 CI 1.2-3.2 and affection of the musculoskeletal system OR 2.6 95 CI 1.41-4.78 before CDI symptoms were factors associated with CDI.

Only 25 isolates were positive for the binary toxin CDTaCDTb  from these 20 80 were from patients with CDI and five 20 from non-CDI patients data not shown.

In addition from the 110 cytotoxic isolates 67 60.9 were from CDI patients while 43 39.1 were from non-CDI patients.
