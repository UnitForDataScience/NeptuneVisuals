In a small prospective study richness a measure of microbial diversity of the intestinal microbiota was inversely associated with the development of food sensitization while the EnterobacteriaceaeBacteroidaceae ratio was positively associated with the development of food sensitization at age 1 year.9 Animal models which can elucidate disease mecha- nisms highlight a protective role for members of the class Clostridia in food sensitization via induction of IL-22 production by innate lymphoid cells with subsequent reduction of allergen exposure to the circulation.10 Clostridia were also enriched in the stool of infants with milk allergy who outgrew their allergy by age 8 years com- pared to those whose allergy did not resolve by that time.11We performed a microbiome-wide association study of the infant intestinal flora and the development of food sensitization and food allergy in a prospective birth cohort of 216 children.

Both diversity of microbial exposures and specific taxa are thought to be protective against development of allergy and asthma.8 The study of the microbiome and food allergy specifically has been less fruitful in part because of the lower prevalence of food allergy and challenges with accurate phenotyping of this disease.

A child was considered to have food allergy if there was caretaker report of healthcare provider-diagnosed allergy to milk egg peanut wheat soy or other nut allergy prior to age 3 years with evidence of IgE sensitization to that food 0.1 kUL at age 3 years.Other study variables included self-reported race and ethnicity of the child categorized as African American Hispanic White and Other maternal vitamin D supplementation treatment assignment child gender mode of delivery vaginal vs C-section age of child at stool collection and whether the child was ingesting formula andor breast milk and solid food at the time of the stool collection.

Subjects with food allergy were in general similar to subjects without food allergy although more subjects with food allergy had a history of C-section delivery 57 vs 30 P.04.

Lactococ- cus of the class Bacilli is the only non-Clostridial Firmicute associ- ated with food allergy in the current study and has anti- inflammatory properties such as reduction of TNF-a.31 Similarrelationships between the Firmicutes identified in our analysis and other allergic disorders have been seen in prior studies of the human intestinal microbiome during infancy Dorea has been inversely asso- ciated with both eczema and allergic sensitization and asthma2122 Dialister has been inversely associated with eczema21 and Lactococ- cus Clostridium and Oscillospira have been inversely associated with atopy and asthma.2232 While the Firmicutes mentioned above do have biological activity suggesting that a potential role in susceptibil- ity to food sensitization or allergy is plausible further work is neces- sary in humans and animal models to understand the strength and mechanism of these associations.Although we did identify individual genera that were significantly associated with food sensitization and allergy global microbiome measures of diversity were similar between cases and controls.

Finally although we are reasonably confident in our case definitions of food sensitization and food allergy some children who did develop and then resolve food allergy may have been misclassified as controls which may have biased our results toward the null.In summary we identified a bacterial genus Dorea which is reduced in the intestinal microbiomes of infants who later develop food sensitization and food allergy.

Published by John Wiley and Sons Ltd. 145 INTRODUCTION Food allergies cause life-threatening anaphylactic reactions in affected children and adults and lead to significant morbidity quality of life impairment and healthcare costs.12 The prevalence of food allergy has markedly increased over a recent time period.3 Although the cause of food allergy is not currently known it is generally accepted that changes in microbial exposures in line with the hygiene hypothesis of allergic disease or the gut microbial depriva- tion hypothesis may in part explain the recent rise in prevalence of food allergy.4-7To date several studies have investigated the relationship between the microbiome and development of allergic disease.

Our objective was to determine whether gut microbial composition was associated with food sensitization and allergy and whether these associations might be along the causal pathway for food allergy or explained by other environmental exposures.

Egg and peanut allergy were the most common food allergies reported in nine and eight subjects respectively while allergy to the other foods occurred in two to three subjects each.
