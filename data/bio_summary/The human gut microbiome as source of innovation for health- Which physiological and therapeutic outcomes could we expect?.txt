this means that within the coming 4 to 5 years this new generation of probiotics will emerge and thereby offer tools to address and mitigate some of the parameters ofhuman gut homeostasis mentioned above for example gut permeability or low grade inflammation.it is obvious that none of these strains will benefit from an acknowledged ''long history of safe use'' as food or drug except to say that they have been in the dominant human gut microbiota for probably most of human evolution.next to these species that became candidates as they consistently emerged as differentially represented in patients compared to healthy individuals some mixed strains emerged from the simplification of complex commu- nities used in microbiota transfer.

more recently differences in composition and function of gut micro- bial communities were recently identified to contribute to interindividual variation in cytokine responses to microbial stimulations in healthy humans as part of the human func- tional genomics project hfgp moreover these functional metagenomics studies were preceded by shotgun sequencing of gut and skin microbiome and around 10 million of bacterial genes were sequenced.

the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with gut dysbiosis and shift in the metabolic function of the gut microbiota.

it was recently shown that the response to a probiotic mix may be modulated by the initial micro- biota configuration the latter driving the permissivity to fermented food lactic acid bacteria similarly work by chung et al.

it has also been documented as a relevant signature of respondersnon-responders to treatments or a biomarker of severity and potentially indicator of the rate of aggrava- tion in chronic conditions.in ibd it would be a signature of the relapse rate of acute phases such that low gene count would be associated with more frequent relapses more than once per year or in other words shorter quiescent phases guarner et al.
