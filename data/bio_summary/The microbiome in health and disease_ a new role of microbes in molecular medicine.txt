In fact nowadays microbes are not only considered as causative pathogens of infectious diseases but also as causative or con- tributing agents of noninfectious particularly chronic diseases like allergies chronic inflammatory bowel diseases colon2J Mol Med 2017 951-3Table 1Progress since the Koch eraKoch 1.0 Microbes are causative agents of disease 1884The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms.The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.Koch 2.0 Genetic and molecular principles of microbial pathogenesis Falkow 1988The phenotype or property under investigation should be associated with pathogenic members of a genus or pathogenic strains of a species.Specific inactivation of the genes associated with the suspected virulence trait should lead to a measurable loss in pathogenicity or virulence.Reversion or allelic replacement of the mutated gene should lead to restoration of pathogenicity.Koch 3.0 Metagenomic equivalents of Koch postulates applied to noninfectious pathobiont-associated diseasesA single strain species genus or phylum or various combinations thereof or genomically encoded functions are significantly correlated with the disease phenotype of a host.Microbiota transfer into an appropriate gnotobiotic defined animal model causes at least some aspects of the disease phenotype or a corresponding change of the metabolome or immune response.The qualitative or quantitative metagenome alteration should be reported in the newly diseased host.Depletion of the identified taxa or functions by intervention via e.g.

antibiotics expansion of beneficial microbes by probiotics prebiotics microbiota transfer or diet reduces progression or ameliorates the disease.Transmissibility is not essentially required as diseases are often the results of a shift of the abundance of endogenous membersfunctional capacities of the microbiota.cancer diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases .

discuss new molecular aspects of the gut-brain axis exemplified by how the microbiota af- fects the cytoplasmic ligand-induced aryl hydrocarbon re- ceptor AhR and how this in turn may affect host physi- ology and diseases including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases .

Finally Willmann and Peter address how the rapidly increasing antimicrobial re- sistance of bacterial pathogens can be tackled by exploring the resistome of the microbiome with the next generation sequencing methods and bioinformatic algorithms and how clinical diagnostics and infection control may profit from molecular microbiota analysis .Future textbooks in human physiology will likely in- clude comprehensive chapters on microbiomes in human health and future textbooks in clinical medicine will possibly deal with microbes not only in the chapter of classical infectious diseases caused by typical patho- gens but also in noninfectious diseases caused or driven by pathobionts.

Subsequently novel treatment and prevention strategies including antimicrobi- al agents vaccines and immunotherapies and the imple- mentation of antiseptic and hygiene measures were devel- oped and proved highly effective in combating infectious diseases.

To this end new postulates era Koch 3.0 based on metagenomics and new analytic tools are necessary Table  to explore and to prove the impact of single microbes or of the concerted action of microbial communities and their metabolites on chronic noninfectious diseases in the context of an individual host genome with an individual lifestyle and environment.In the present issue of the Journal of Molecular Medicine several important aspects of current research around the microbiome and its role in human health and disease are discussed Johnson and colleagues elaborate on the specific components of the microbiota the Bacteroidetes by discussing the genetic variability of this phylum the sometimes opposing effects on metabolic dis- eases such as obesity or type II diabetes and the problem of health-interpretable microbiome data .

Yiu and col- leagues extend this by reporting recent findings and ideas how host metabolism body weight and diseases like obe- sity may be affected by interactions with the immune sys- tem metabolism and the microbiota .
