in fact nowadays microbes are not only considered as causative pathogens of infectious diseases but also as causative or con- tributing agents of noninfectious particularly chronic diseases like allergies chronic inflammatory bowel diseases colon2j mol med 2017 951-3table 1progress since the koch erakoch 1.0 microbes are causative agents of disease 1884the microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms.the microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.the cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.the microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.koch 2.0 genetic and molecular principles of microbial pathogenesis falkow 1988the phenotype or property under investigation should be associated with pathogenic members of a genus or pathogenic strains of a species.specific inactivation of the genes associated with the suspected virulence trait should lead to a measurable loss in pathogenicity or virulence.reversion or allelic replacement of the mutated gene should lead to restoration of pathogenicity.koch 3.0 metagenomic equivalents of koch postulates applied to noninfectious pathobiont-associated diseasesa single strain species genus or phylum or various combinations thereof or genomically encoded functions are significantly correlated with the disease phenotype of a host.microbiota transfer into an appropriate gnotobiotic defined animal model causes at least some aspects of the disease phenotype or a corresponding change of the metabolome or immune response.the qualitative or quantitative metagenome alteration should be reported in the newly diseased host.depletion of the identified taxa or functions by intervention via e.g.

finally willmann and peter address how the rapidly increasing antimicrobial re- sistance of bacterial pathogens can be tackled by exploring the resistome of the microbiome with the next generation sequencing methods and bioinformatic algorithms and how clinical diagnostics and infection control may profit from molecular microbiota analysis .future textbooks in human physiology will likely in- clude comprehensive chapters on microbiomes in human health and future textbooks in clinical medicine will possibly deal with microbes not only in the chapter of classical infectious diseases caused by typical patho- gens but also in noninfectious diseases caused or driven by pathobionts.

experimental approaches tackling the role of microbes in disease however largely depend on the ability to cultivate according to koch's postulates and to genetically manipulate microbes ac- cording to falkow's molecular equivalents in order to test them in experimental systems.

subsequently novel treatment and prevention strategies including antimicrobi- al agents vaccines and immunotherapies and the imple- mentation of antiseptic and hygiene measures were devel- oped and proved highly effective in combating infectious diseases.

yiu and col- leagues extend this by reporting recent findings and ideas how host metabolism body weight and diseases like obe- sity may be affected by interactions with the immune sys- tem metabolism and the microbiota .

the rising field of mucosal immunology together with the development of germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse models however attracted atten- tion and provided the tools necessary to address the role of commensal microbes as putative disease-associated oppor- tunistic pathogens or bpathobionts.

pathobionts are resi- dent microbes innocuous to the host under normal condi- tions but with pathogenic potential in susceptible hosts e.g.

however the absence of appro- priate experimental methods to determine and to analyze the noncultivable microbes from the microbiota had ham- pered further elucidation of their role in etiology and path- ogenesis of diseases.a breakthrough was achieved by the implementation of the next generation sequencing and new bioinformatic algorithms for metagenomic data analysis - and provided the foun- ingo b. autenrieth 1 institute of medical and hygiene university hospital tubingen elfriede aulhorn str.
