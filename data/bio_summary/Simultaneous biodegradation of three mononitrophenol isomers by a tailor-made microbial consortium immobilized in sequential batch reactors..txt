arrows above indicate the start of each cycle where the initial concentration of onp mnp and pnp was ranging from 02 to 08 mol l-1 02-04 mol l-1 and 03- 06 mol l-1 respectively.degraded onp mmp and pnp were 28 mol l-1 15 mol l-1 and 23 mol l-1 respectively during the experiment course.

strain nyz215 was able to completely degrade up to 08 mol l-1 onp within 140 h. strain jmp134 was able to mineralize mnp of the concentration up to 15 mol l-1 with 22 h while 20 mol l-1 mnp was not mineralized for more than 30 h. strain wbc-3 was able to utilize pnp of the con- centration up to 25 mol l-1 within 30 h.the toxicity of each isomer to the strains degraded two other isomers was also assessed.

2009. it has been shown that onpa-encoded onp 2-monooxygenase in strain nyz215 mnpa-encoded mnp nitroreductase in strain jmp134 and pnpa-encoded pnp 4-monooxygenase in strain wbc-3 catalyse the initial reactions of onp mnp and pnp catabolism respectively with concomitant release of ammonium or nitrite xiao et al.

the onp concentrations mol l-1 were 02 04 06 08. b meta-nitrophenol mnp degradation by strain jmp134 v. the mnp concentrations mol l-1 were 05 10 15 20. c para-nitrophenol pnp by strain wbc-3 .

2 05 mol l-1 mnp and pnp were completely degraded in 12 h but onp in more than 60 h.the degradation of pnp is significantly faster than its two isomers onp and mnp when simultaneous degrada- tion of three isomers was conducted in a single flask fig.

1.to determine the suitable degradable concentration of substrates by individual strains different concentrations of each mononitrophenol 02 04 06 08 mol l-1 for onp 05 10 15 20 mol l-1 for mnp and 05 125 175 25 mol l-1 for pnp were used for their corre- sponding bacteria to grow fig.

in a previous report the inhibi- tion of pnp degradation was overcome by increasing the inoculum size which increased the strain's tolerance and degradation of high pnp concentrations zohar et al.

2010. meanwhile the amount of nitrite 153 - 008 mol l-1 is almost equiva- lent to the sum of onp 087 - 006 mol l-1 and pnp 059 - 004 mol l-1 since the strains nyz215 and wbc-3 degrade their corresponding nitrophenol via oxidative pathways xiao et al.

4. the target genes are onpa-encoding onp monooxygenase in strain nyz215 mnpa-encoding mnp reductase in strain jmp134 and pnpa-encoding pnp monooxygenase in strain wbc-3.

it was found that 05 mol l-1 pnp totally inhibited the degradation ability of strains nyz215 and jmp134 to degrade 05 mol l-1 onp and mnp in the flask respectively.

the pnp concentrations mol l-1 were 05 10 15 20 25 30.that pnp due to its toxicity inhibited the degradation activity of strains nyz215 and jmp134.

pilot test was conducted in flasks to demonstrate that a mixture of three mononitrophenols at 05 mol l-1 each could be mineralized by this microbial consortium within 84 h. interestingly neither onp nor mnp was degraded until pnp was almost consumed by strain wbc-3.

each strain was grown overnight in mm supplemented with 05 mol l-1 onp mnp and pnp.

pnp was used uptime hfigure 3 simultaneous degradation of three mononitrophenol iso- mers ortho-nitrophenol onp  meta-nitrophenol mnp v and para-nitrophenol pnp  by strains nyz215 jmp134 and wbc-3 in flasks.

for aerobic degradation it is generally accepted that the substrate is mineralized if dtoc is 70 professor rolf-michael wittich personal correspondence 2011. strains nyz215 jmp134 and wbc-3 were pregrown overnight in mineral medium mm plus corresponding nitrophenol onp mnp or pnp at 05 mol l-1 respectively with an induction per- iod prior to growth in the medium xiao et al.
