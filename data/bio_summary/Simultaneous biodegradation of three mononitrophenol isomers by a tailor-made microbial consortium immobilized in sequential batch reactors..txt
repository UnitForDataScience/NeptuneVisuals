Arrows above indicate the start of each cycle where the initial concentration of ONP MNP and PNP was ranging from 02 to 08 mol l-1 02-04 mol l-1 and 03- 06 mol l-1 respectively.degraded ONP MMP and PNP were 28 mol l-1 15 mol l-1 and 23 mol l-1 respectively during the experiment course.

It has been shown that onpA-encoded ONP 2-monooxygenase in strain NyZ215 mnpA-encoded MNP nitroreductase in strain JMP134 and pnpA-encoded PNP 4-monooxygenase in strain WBC-3 catalyse the initial reactions of ONP MNP and PNP catabolism respectively with concomitant release of ammonium or nitrite Xiao et al.

The ONP concentrations mol l-1 were 02 04 06 08. b meta-nitrophenol MNP degradation by strain JMP134 V. The MNP concentrations mol l-1 were 05 10 15 20. c para-nitrophenol PNP by strain WBC-3 .

Strain NyZ215 was able to completely degrade up to 08 mol l-1 ONP within 140 h. Strain JMP134 was able to mineralize MNP of the concentration up to 15 mol l-1 with 22 h while 20 mol l-1 MNP was not mineralized for more than 30 h. Strain WBC-3 was able to utilize PNP of the con- centration up to 25 mol l-1 within 30 h.The toxicity of each isomer to the strains degraded two other isomers was also assessed.

2 05 mol l-1 MNP and PNP were completely degraded in 12 h but ONP in more than 60 h.The degradation of PNP is significantly faster than its two isomers ONP and MNP when simultaneous degrada- tion of three isomers was conducted in a single flask Fig.

1.To determine the suitable degradable concentration of substrates by individual strains different concentrations of each mononitrophenol 02 04 06 08 mol l-1 for ONP 05 10 15 20 mol l-1 for MNP and 05 125 175 25 mol l-1 for PNP were used for their corre- sponding bacteria to grow Fig.

Meanwhile the amount of nitrite 153 - 008 mol l-1 is almost equiva- lent to the sum of ONP 087 - 006 mol l-1 and PNP 059 - 004 mol l-1 since the strains NyZ215 and WBC-3 degrade their corresponding nitrophenol via oxidative pathways Xiao et al.

It was found that 05 mol l-1 PNP totally inhibited the degradation ability of strains NyZ215 and JMP134 to degrade 05 mol l-1 ONP and MNP in the flask respectively.

The target genes are onpA-encoding ONP monooxygenase in strain NyZ215 mnpA-encoding MNP reductase in strain JMP134 and pnpA-encoding PNP monooxygenase in strain WBC-3.

In a previous report the inhibi- tion of PNP degradation was overcome by increasing the inoculum size which increased the strain's tolerance and degradation of high PNP concentrations Zohar et al.
