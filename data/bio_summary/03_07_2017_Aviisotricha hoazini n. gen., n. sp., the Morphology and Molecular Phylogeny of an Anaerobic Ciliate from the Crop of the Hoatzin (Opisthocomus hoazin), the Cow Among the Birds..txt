Our measurements on Chatton- Lwoff stained cells were as follows macronuclear length from 10-18.9 um in ventrally-oriented cells and from 10-18.9 um in laterally-oriented cells  macronuclear width from 5.6-12.2 um in ventrally-oriented cells and from 5.6-12.2 um in laterally-oriented cells and macronuclear depth from 7.8-12.2 um in ventrally-oriented cells and from 6.7-13.3 um in laterally-oriented cells The micronucleus which accompanies the macronucleus typically at one end B is ellipsoid ranging from 2.2-3.3 um in length by2.2 um in width Contrary to Isotricha the macronucleus in Aviisotricha is not connected to a karyophore.

This special type of dorsal brush is called a mixed brush for reasons given in the Discussion.The oral region is bounded on its right margin by 9-15 kineties whose kinetids are extremely densely packed A and can give the appearance of a membranelle-like ciliature in scanning elec- tron micrographs A. Lateral nematodesmata from these kinetids extend internally to support the right wall of the oral cavity LNd Figs C LNd A which is non-ciliated and covered by a number of oral ribs supported by microtubu- lar ribbons Figs C. The oral cavity itself is flattened laterally ranging from 12.2-16.7 um in length by 4.4-6.7 um in width as measured in our Chatton-Lwoff silver stains but these measurements especially the width may include fibrous elements of the wall of the oral cavity which cannot be resolved by the light microscope.

Viewed from the anterior pole the oral cavity is slightly concave on its right side and given this concav- ity its depth ranged from 15.5-18.9 um  C. The oral cavity is often also oriented slightly towards the anterior pole although this ori- entation varies see C. It is our interpretation that the somatic kineties that contact the oral open- ing at its right posterior margin around to the left anterior margin enter the oral cavity and line the posterior and left walls of the oral cavity Figs A C C C. Their kinetids are extremely densely packed and give rise to nematodesmata that merge with the axial nematodesmata to support the oralFigure 2.

However the approximately equatorial position of its oral apparatus the location in the crop of the hoatzin and its significant genetic divergence from other isotrichids justify the estab- lishment of the new genus Aviisotricha n. gen. with its new type species Aviisotricha hoazini n. gen. n. sp.Aviisotricha n. gen.Diagnosis.

What is missing is a morphogenetic study of how the single central kinety develops between the normal brush kineties.Phylogenetic Position of Aviisotricha hoazini n. gen. n. sp.Aviisotricha hoazini n. gen. n. sp.

Oligoisotricha or at the poste- rior end Dasytricha Isotricha In these latter genera during division morphogenesis the oral region moves anteriorly almost to the cell equator becoming the oral apparatus for the proter while the opisthe's oral apparatus develops at the posterior end  In this feature these genera recapitulatethe approximately equatorial position of the oral apparatus of A. hoazini.Finally our molecular phylogenetic analyses using partial SSUrRNA sequences strongly sup- port a relationship of A. hoazini with isolates of Dasytricha and Isotricha.

Cytological staining of this isotrichid-like ciliate with the Chatton-Lwoff and Protargol staining procedures as well as SEM and TEM justified the establishment of the new genus Aviisotricha n. gen. with its new type species Aviisotricha hoazini n. gen. n. sp.. Phylogenetic analyses of a portion of the small subunit rRNA gene supported the taxonomic placement of this new genus and species in the family Isotrichidae.
