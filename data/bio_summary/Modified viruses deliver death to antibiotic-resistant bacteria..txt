phages could also potentially transfer antibiotic-resistance genes to non- resistant bacteria she says.lu adds that bacteria may still develop resistance even to the engineered phages.paris uses a similar approach.

these viruses infect only specific speciesor strains of bacteria so they have less of an impact on the human body's natural microbial community or microbiome than antibiotics do.

bacteria can also quickly evolve resist- ance to natural phages meaning researchers would constantly have to isolate new ones capable of defeating the same bacterial2 9 j u n e 2 0 1 7  v o l 5 4 6  n a t u r e  5 8 7 strain or species.

but eventually they want to develop phages that will let them precisely engineer the human microbiome by removing natu- rally occurring bacteria associated with conditions such as obesity autism and some cancers.

'super- charged' phages created by a group at syn- thetic genomics in la jolla california could contain dozens of special features including enzymes that break down biofilms or proteins that help to hide the phages from the human immune system.but engineered phages still have to over-antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

phages could also allow researchers to manipulate the micro- biomes of experimental animals which could help them to untangle how certain bacteria influence conditions such as autism says timothy lu a synthetic biologist at the massa- chusetts institute of technology in cambridgeso researchers might have to modify their phages frequently to keep up with bacterial mutations.but as antibiotic resistance spreads kutter says there will be plenty of space for both engi- neered phages and natural phage therapies which are also growing in popularity.
