Phages could also allow researchers to manipulate the micro- biomes of experimental animals which could help them to untangle how certain bacteria influence conditions such as autism says Timothy Lu a synthetic biologist at the Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology in CambridgeSo researchers might have to modify their phages frequently to keep up with bacterial mutations.But as antibiotic resistance spreads Kutter says there will be plenty of space for both engi- neered phages and natural phage therapies which are also growing in popularity.

DRUG RESISTANCE Modified viruses deliver death to antibiotic-resistant bacteriaEngineered microbes use CRISPR to turn a bacterium's immune response against itself.BY SARA REARDON enetically modified viruses that cause bacteria to kill themselves could be the next step in combating antibiotic-resistant infections.Several companies have engineered such viruses called bacteriophages to use the CRISPR gene-editing system to kill specific bacteria according to a presentation at the CRISPR 2017 conference in Big Sky Montana this month.

Phages could also potentially transfer antibiotic-resistance genes to non- resistant bacteria she says.Lu adds that bacteria may still develop resistance even to the engineered phages.Paris uses a similar approach.

Cas3 eventually destroys all the DNA killing the bacterium.Another company Eligo Bioscience inWe think we will be able to reach into the human body in any single location and eliminate anysingle bacteria wechoose.in any single loca- tion and eliminate any single bacteria we choose says Barrangou.Both Barrangou a n d D up or t e t acknowledge that for now causal links between the human microbiome andcome some hurdles.

'Super- charged' phages created by a group at Syn- thetic Genomics in La Jolla California could contain dozens of special features including enzymes that break down biofilms or proteins that help to hide the phages from the human immune system.But engineered phages still have to over-antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

This suggests that the impact of the blasts could extend well beyond such distances Semmens says.Dead bodies in net tows don't lie says Doug Nowacek a marine ecologist at Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort North Carolina who was not involved in the study.

It could be that our focus has kind of been blinkered because it's been on whales he says.

Treating an infection might require a large volume of phages says Elizabeth Kutter a microbiologist at Evergreen State College in Olympia Washington and it's unclear whether this would trigger immune reactions some of which could interfere with the treatment.

As part of that process the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA must also evaluate permit requests from those companies because their proposed activities could affect marine mammals.

The blast might not kill them all directly but it could disorient them and make it harder for them to survive.Semmens is planning a follow-on study with a full seismic air-gun set-up similar to that used in industrial activities to determine how far the effects of the noise extend.
