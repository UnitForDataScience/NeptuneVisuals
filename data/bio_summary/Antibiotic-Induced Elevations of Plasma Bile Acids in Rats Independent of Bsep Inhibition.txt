The Ntcp transporter is mainly responsible for conjugated bile acid uptake to liver while the Oatp transporters are believed to be responsible for unconju- gated bile acid uptake Klaassen and Cui 2015.In addition to these mechanisms reports have indicated that gut bacteria are involved in bile acid metabolism including amino acid and sulfate deconjugation of conjugated bile acids and 7ab-dehydroxylation during enterohepatic recirculation EHR Klaassen and Cui 2015 Rodrigues et al.

Furthermore conjugated bile acids can be monitored in clinical serum or plasma samples when blood is taken for drug levels or serum clinical chemistry making them an attractive biomarker to inform potential BSEP inhibition.In addition to Bsep inhibition there are other potential factors that may also result in plasma bile acid increases including inhibi- tion of the hepatic uptake transporters Sodium Taurocholate Co- transporting Polypeptide Ntcp and Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides Oatps activation of bile acid synthesis pathways and inhibition of Apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter Asbt and organic solute transporters Ostab in the intestine Ballatori et al.

Exceptions were noted as fol- lows Glycodeoxycholic acid GDCA and a and b tauromuricholic acid TaMCA TbMCA were obtained from Steroid Inc. Newport RI and Taurocholic acid 220440-d4 TCA-d4 was purchased from Alsachim Inc. Wilmington DE.

To explore alternative mechanisms of bile acid increases in plasma 6 antibiotic and 2 nonantibiotic drugs unlikely to be Bsep inhibitors were evaluated in rat studies.Surprisingly all 6 antibiotics demonstrated 2- to 14-fold increases of plasma taurocholic acid TCA.

HPLC grade water with 0.1 formic acid methanol acetonitrile with 0.1 formic acid were purchased from Burdick  Jackson Muskegon MI.

Mobile phase A was 0.1 formic acid FA water and mobile phase B was acetonitrile ACN with 0.1 formic acid FA.

CDCA is a minor primary bile acid in rats and its secondary bile acid is LCA.

Therefore interpretation of these bile acid increases should be carefully examined with the temporal individual bile acid patterns severity and time course of clinical chemistry and histomorphological changes necrosis and cho- lestasis.

A decrease of unconjugated bile acids following antibiotic treatment may be useful in differ- entiating the mechanism of bile acid increases from that of hepatotoxins.Inhibition of uptake transporters Ntcp or Oatps may alsocontribute to conjugated bile acid increases in plasma because dose levels in our studies were high.
