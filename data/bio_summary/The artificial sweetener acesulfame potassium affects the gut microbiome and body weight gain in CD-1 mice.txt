There was no any statistical differ- ence in the initial body weight between the control and Ace-K group for either male or female mice males 26.8-1.1 g and 26.4-1.1 g for the control and Ace-K group females 22.8-1.6 g and 22.4-1.1 g for the control and Ace-K group.

In this study we found that CA and DCA increased and decreased respectively after Ace-K treatment  highlighting the effects of Ace-K on the homeostasis and biotransformation of bile acids important signaling molecules in inflammation and glucose metabolism -.Collectively our data evidence that Ace-K consumption can lead to adverse effects in the gut microbiome of mice.

There- fore the examination of gender-specific gut microbiome responses to Ace-K consumption would be highly informative.In this study we investigated the effects of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and the changes in the fecal metabolome using 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrom- etry GC-MS metabolomics.

For female mie the body weight gain was not significantly different between the control and treated animals as shown in .Ace-K altered the gut microbiome components in a gender-specific mannerGiven that Ace-K induced gender-dependent body weight gain in animals and considering the crucial role of gut bacteria in host energy homeostasis we further explored whether Ace-K has different effects on the gut microbiota of male and female mice.

These results indicated that Ace-K perturbed the gut microbiome composition in a gen- der-dependent manner.Effects of four weeks of Ace-K consumption on the body weight gain and gut microbiome composition of CD-1 mice.

B Ace-K consumption altered the composition of gut bacteria in female mice.The abundances of Lactobacillus Clostridium an unassigned Ruminococcaceae genus and an unassigned Oxalobacteraceae genus were significantly decreased and the abundance of Mucispirillum was increased after Ace-K consumption.

The fecal metabolomic profiling results suggested that Ace-K consumption can significantly change the gut metabolic profiles which can influ- ence the crosstalk between the host and gut microbiome.DiscussionIn this study we applied DNA sequencing and metabolomics approaches to characterize the gender-specific effects of Ace-K consumption on gut microbiota and their metabolism.

Our ongoing study using multiple human-relevant doses aims at better understanding the chronic effect of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and host.Finally the major goal of this study was to define the impact of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and fecal metabolome.

Acesulfame-potassium Ace-K a FDA-approved artificial sweet- ener is commonly used but its toxicity data reported to date are considered inadequate.

In particular the functional impact of Ace-K on the gut microbiome is largely unknown.
