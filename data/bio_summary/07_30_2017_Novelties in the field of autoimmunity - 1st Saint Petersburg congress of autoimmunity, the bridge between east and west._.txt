the authors concluded that vitamin d supplementation as safe and beneficial in autoimmune patients and therefore is advised for them .moreover the question of what are the proper medical interven-tions for patients with autoimmune diseases extends much further than the issue of vitamin d troubling doctors throughout the field of autoimmunity.

evaluated the existence of anti-hmgcr antibodies in stat- in-exposed patients with suspicion for imnm and in two control groups healthy subjects and patients with different autoimmune rheu- matic diseases.

autoimmunity reviews 16 2017 1175-11841177further addressing implications of autoimmunity on the female patients updates of the pathophysiology and developing therapies for obstetric anti phospholipid syndrome aps were presented.

in this study iif was compared to antigen-specific immunoassays for mpo- andpr3-anca based on samples of 251 of vasculitis patients and 924 sample of patients suspected of vasculitis in which aav diagnosis eventually was rejected.

a clin- ical study investigating the characteristics of the gut microbiota in lupus patients compared to healthy controls found that in medication free patients the composition of gut microbiota was similar in the sle group regardless of clinical manifestations or anti-dsdna antibodies levels .

alterations in the human gut and oral mucosa microbiota have been recognized as an important environmental factor in autoimmune diseases and specifi- cally in sle patients.

to tie up the loose ends it has been reported that higher rates of lym- phomas has been observed among patients with autoimmune dis- eases .not only lymphoma is highly associated with autoimmune diseases as was beautifully presented by michael ehrenfeld who discussed the issue of ra  malignancy and the impact of tnf inhibitors on lympho- mas and skin cancers.

indeed multiplex proteomic tech- nology is considered to be an optimal solution for the simultaneous de- tection of different autoantibodies allowing the autoantibody profiling of autoimmune patients either for diagnostic or prognostic purposes or even for prevention of autoimmune diseases.

the amazing city of saint petersburg was the perfect frame for intense and vibrant discussions with an inspiring atmosphere of medical science infused with the magical surroundings of a city designed to build bridges.autoimmune diseases - diverse clinical aspectsrarely does the scientific community dedicate adequate room for a principal discussion on the philosophy of medical research namely the significance of a holistic oriented approach in the research of human biology and specifically in deciphering autoimmune diseases .

these biomarkers are an important tool for prevention early diagnosis assessment of dis- ease activity progression rate clinical laboratory subtypes of autoim- mune diseases prediction of the efficiency of therapy and the risk of adverse events during treatment  and deciphering the key pathoge- netic mechanisms of autoimmune diseases could identify the molecular and cellular biomarkers that might be used as therapeutic targets hence improving both patient life span and quality .an important attention was also given to autoimmune thyroiditis ait showing that nowadays ait became the most prevalent autoimmune and most frequent endocrine disorder especially among females.

possible explanation for the association be- tween vitamin d deficiency and autoimmunity were discussed in- cluding steroids usage common genetic pathway sunlight avoidance behavior in sle patients and vitamin d as a negative acute phase reactant.

also the severity of periodontitis is associated with the severity of sle disease .these findings suggest that manipulation of the microbiota may bebeneficial in patients with sle.factors in autoimmunity and how to overcome themgenetic factors play an important role in the mosaic of autoimmuni- ty.

using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and chemiluminescence immunoassay cia assays they have found the presence of anti-hmgcr antibodies in samples from statin- exposed patients with suspicion for imnm current laboratory techniques used in the autoimmunity field such as high-technology automated analytical systems were the focus of a thorough review given by alexandrova et al.
