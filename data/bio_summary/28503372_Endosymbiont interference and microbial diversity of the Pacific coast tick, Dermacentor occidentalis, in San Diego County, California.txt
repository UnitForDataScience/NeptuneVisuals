We also hypothesized that differences among tick microbiomes would be associated with different geographic locations and that possible reservoirs of tick pathogens could be foundby analyzing ticks for the host origin of prior blood meals or by comparing the tick microbiomes to the skin microbiomes of potential host species.

PeerJ 5e3202 DOI INTRODUCTIONThe Pacific Coast tick Dermacentor occidentalis Marx henceforth D. occidentalis is the most widely distributed tick in California and is found in chaparral and shrubland areas from northern Baja California to California and Oregon .D.

Although discovered in 1966 and long suspected of being able to cause disease it was only recently confirmed to be associated with eschars and lymphadenopathy in people at the site of a tick bite   .Francisella-like endosymbiotic bacteria FLEs have also been detected in Dermacentor occidentalis as well as other tick species    .

are vertically transmitted have been observed within tick ovaries and Malpighian tubules and vary by tick species .

demonstrated pathogenicity of a Francisella endosymbiont derived from Dermacentor andersoni Stiles ticks previously categorized as Wolbachia persica  to guinea pigs and hamsters via injection most FLEs are not transmitted by tick bites and are considered non-pathogenic   .Interestingly the inability of different endosymbiotic Rickettsia species to co-infect the same organ in the same tick called ''interference'' has been demonstrated although the exact mechanisms are unknown.

Attention to the microbiome of ticks has been driven in part by the fact that ticks can transmit the broadest range of diseases of any arthropod and the recognition that tick co-infections can have dramatic consequences on both the tick host and human patient .

Use of SourceTracker for comparison of tick and skin microbiomes is a novel approach and interestingly generalized linear models showed that ticks with canine skin microbiome components were less likely to be infected with Ricketssia which is consistent with R. rhipicephali and R. philipii being endosymbionts without a canine host.CONCLUSIONSThe results of this study suggest that FLE and Rickettsia endosymbionts partially exclude each other in co-infections of the same D. occidentalis tick.
