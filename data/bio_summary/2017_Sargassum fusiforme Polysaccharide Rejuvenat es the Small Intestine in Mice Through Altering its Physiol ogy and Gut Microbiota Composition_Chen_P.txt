Moreover SFPS could partially rejuvenate the overall status of the small intestine microbiota.Conclusion The results suggested that dietary SFPS may promote the health condition of the small intestine consequently leading to a healthy aging.Keywords Sargassum fusiforme polysaccharides intestinal microbiota Nrf2 small intestine aging Nrf2ARE signaling pathway.INTRODUCTIONSargassum fusiforme is known as a longevity vegetable in Eastern Asia because it is a rich source of health-promoting substances 1.

Thus the enrichment of Bacteroidetes in the small intestine of mice that had been continuously fed SFPF over a long period could be related to the degradation of carbohydrate in the intestine accounting for the robust digestion despite the age of the animal.The compositional change of the small intestine microbiota in chronic aging process and the effect of SFPS treatment were further studied at the genus level.

Since long-term dietary intake of SFPS could reverse the loss of cytoprotective capacity in the small intestine of mice as they aged the effect of dietary SFPS on bacterial community in the small intestine of these animals was evaluated.Following all denoising and filtering steps a dataset consisting of 249187 262222 229041 and 264730 reads from the mus20M mus11M mus4M and mus20MP groups respectively was used for the final analysis Table 1.

Since the digestion capacity of the intestine is linked to the metabolism of the gut bacteria an enhancement in polysaccharide metabolism may be also enhance the digestive capacity of the small intestine while a reduction in polysaccharide metabolism may lead to a decline in the digestive capacity of the intestine as manifested by age.

Since phenol iso-butyric acid and iso-valeric acid are inducers of the Nrf2ARE signaling pathway we presumed that the anti-aging effect of SFPS may be linked to the abundance of Atopostipes and its metabolites.Overall the mus20MP and mus11M group mice appeared to have a similar compositional gut microbiota suggesting that long-term administration of SFPS could maintain the youthful composition of the small intestine microbiota in these animals despite their age increase.Key Phylotypes of Gut Microbiota Modulated by SFPSThe specific bacteria that are characteristic of each group of mice were analyzed by LEfSe.

However it remains unclear as to whether S. fusiforme polysaccharides can prevent the insult of oxidant and aging through modulating the physiological status and microbiota of the intestine.A R T I C L E H I S T O R YReceived March 1 2017Revised May 27 2017Accepted May 28 2017DOI 10.21741566524018666171205115516Methods To assess the cytoprotective effect of S. fusiforme polysaccharides SFPS in the small intestine of mice embarking on the aging process we compared the expressions of Nrf2 and several representative markers SOD-2 CAT NQO1 and HO-1 of the Nrf2ARE signaling pathway in the small intestine of male ICR mice fed with a control diet with those of mice fed with a SFPS-containing diet.

In addition the overall compositional changes in the small intestine microbiota were determined by 16s rDNA sequencing followed by alpha and beta diversity analyses.Results The results showed that dietary intake of SFPS could ameliorate the declined cytoprotective capacity of the small intestine by upregulating the Nrf2ARE signaling pathway.

Activators and inhibitors of Nrf2 play pivotal roles in the maintenance of health 22 however the relationship between the Nrf2ARE signaling and the gut microbiota remains unclear 25.Long-term Dietary Intake of SFPS Affects the Composition and Diversity of Gut MicrobiotaThe cytoprotective capacity of the small intestine is intimately related to healthy aging.

In order to investigate whether S. fusiforme polysaccharide could influence the physiological function and microbiota of the small intestine and thereby slow down the aging process the present study evaluated the cytoprotective capacity of the small intestine in mice by selectively investigating the changes in the Nrf2ARE signaling pathway.

Changes in the key phylotypes resulted from the SFPS treatment suggested a positive correlation existed between the anti-aging effect of SFPS and the significant changes in small intestinal microbiota.Long-term dietary intake of SFPS also dramatically increased the number of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Staphylococcus while markedly decreased the number of Lactobacillus and unidentified Ruminococcaceae at the genus level Fig.
