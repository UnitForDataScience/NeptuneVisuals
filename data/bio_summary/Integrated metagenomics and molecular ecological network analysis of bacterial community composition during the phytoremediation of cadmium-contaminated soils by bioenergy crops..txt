to our knowledge this is the first study to use time network analysis based on miseq sequencing to investigative microbial interactions in unplanted soils and soils planted with bioenergy maize and soybean crops for the phytoremediation of cadmium-contaminated soils.conclusionstwo energy crops were used to remediate cadmium-contaminated soils and the rhizosphere bacterial community composition was stu- died by miseq sequencing.

1. pca results of bacterial community diversity.effects of bioenergy cropping changes on the rhizosphere bacterial community in cadmium-contaminated soilto investigate the effects of bioenergy cropping changes on the rhizosphere bacterial community the lefse was used to identify dif- ferentially abundant taxons between bioenergy-planted samples and unplanted controls grown in 50 mg kg-1 cadmium-contaminated soils.

the average geodesic distance gd values for the unplanted soybean and maize networks were 4.638 4.122 and 2.866 respec- tively which are comparable to those of networks that display small- world behavior.

the molecular ecological network analysis constructed based on miseq sequencing indicated that the bioenergy cropping systems increased the complexity of the bacterial community network and altered the topological roles of individual otus and keystone populations.

in addition the number of nodes in the soybean-planted and maize-planted networks 485 and 502 nodes respectively was greater than that in the control network 435 nodes and the bioenergy cropping network was denser with a lower average gd.

maize presented a higher cadmium accumulation due to its higher biomass.miseq sequencing and bacterial community compositionmiseq pyrosequencing was used to research the rhizosphere bac- terial community composition of the maize and soybean crops.

the adonis statistical test further revealed significant differences in the community composition between the unplanted controls and soybean-planted treatments p  0.002 and between the unplanted controls and maize-planted treat- ments p  0.003. the taxa with a higher bacterial abundance in the maize- and soybean-planted treatments mainly belonged to eight phyla actinobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi cyano- bacteria fibrobacteres verrucomicrobia and candidatedivisionws6 and nine phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloro- flexi firmicutes armatimonadetes verrucomicrobia wchb160 and candidatedivisiontm7 respectively and the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria were more abundant in both the maize- and soy- bean-planted treatments .

maize and soybean exhibited high tis for biomass and length and these values were higher than 63.33 with the exception of the leaf biomass in soybean 55.12. the tis of the maize and soybean total biomass were85.66 and 68.65 respectively.

twenty-six and twenty- one genus-level biomarkers for maize- and soybean-planted treatments were from proteobacteria mainly from the families comamonadaceae sphingomonadaceae xanthomonadaceae rhodospirillaceae hyphomicro- biaceae burkholderiaceae and nannocystaceae and the families methy- lophilaceae phyllobacteriaceae rhizobiaceae burkholderiaceae alcali- genaceae bradyrhizobiaceae caulobacteraceae and acetobacteraceae respectively.the networks of bacterial communities and their responses to bioenergy maize and soybean croppingto identify the effects of bioenergy maize and soybean croppingfig.

the average clustering coefficient avgcc values ranged from 0.238 to 0.337 which are higher than those of random networks 0.008-0.024. the networks constructed from the unplanted soybean-planted and maize-planted samples yielded modularity values of 0.739 0.814 and 0.806 respectively.
