Thus infection with Aa affects NAFLD by altering the gut microbiota and glucose metabolism.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease.

Accumulating fatty acid in the gut might be transported to the liver via the portal vein and exacerbate liver steatosis.

NAFLD was diagnosed according to the following criteria 1 a slight diffuse increase in bright homogeneous echoes in the liver parenchyma with normal visualis- ation of the diaphragm and portal and hepatic vein borders and normal hepatorenal contrast of echogenicity 2 a diffuse increase in bright echoes in the liver parenchyma with slightly impaired visualisation of the peripheral portal and hepatic vein borders and 3 a marked increase in bright echoes at a shallow depth with deep atten- uation and impaired visualisation of the diaphragm and marked vascular blurring as previously described.

Difference between liver and spleen CT numbers in the normal adult its usefulness in predicting the presence of diffuse liver disease.

In addition Akt phosphorylation was lower in the liver of NCAaHFAa than in NCcoHFco mice.

NAFLD includes a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from non-alcoholic fatty liver NAFL to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH.

Based on the results we then investigated the influence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans infection on gut microbiota glucoselipid metabolism and liver steatosis in mice.ResultsCorrelation between IgG antibody titers against periodontal pathogens and clinicalbiochem- ical parameters in NAFLD patients.

Interestingly anti-Aa IgG antibody titer showed a negative correlation with the liver spleen LS ratio Fig.

actinomycetemcomitans administration increases liver steatosis.
