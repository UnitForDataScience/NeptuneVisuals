These changes do not seem to affect the clinical efficacy of FMT in RCDI patients over 12 months.Keywords Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection  Fecal microbiota transplantation  Gut microbiota  16s rRNA AnalysisAbbreviationsCDIClostridium difficile infection FMTFecal microbiota transplantation GIGastrointestinalRCDIRecurrent Clostridium difficile infectionIntroductionIn the last decade Clostridium difficile infection CDI has reached epidemic proportion with an estimated 453000 casesyear in United States and approximately 29300 deaths .

All the data were handled in HIPAA protective manner throughout the study period.DefinitionsClostridium difficile infection CDI was defined as unformed stools in 24 h and positive stool C. difficile toxin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA or C difficile toxin gene B by PCR .

The donors were divided into two groups according to age group with age 60 years L60 group and group with age C60 years G60 group.16S rRNA Library Preparation and Sequence AnalysisStool sample sequencing libraries were prepared using primers that represent hypervariable regions of the bacte- rial 16S rRNA gene regions.

Furthermore the long-term fol- low-up indicated that there was no recurrence of C. difficile infection in either group over 12 months.Fig.

L60 group included 20 donors 60 years of age and G60 group included 8 donors above the age 60 Table .

L60 group donated fecal sample primarily for their respective parents 1220 60 in contrast to G60 group which provided fecal samples for their respective spouses 48 50.Twenty-eight recipients with RCDI 22 females 78.5 received the FMT from their respective donors Table .

The median fol- low-up in the L60 stool recipient group and the G60 stool recipient group was 40 months and 41 months respectively Table .

p  NS.Microbiome CompositionAt the phylum level Actinobacteria were significantly less abundant in G60 group as compared to L60 group p value0.05.

Similarly at the family level the abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae was also reduced in the G60 group as compared to L60 group p value 0.05.

Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifi- dobacterium adolescentis were significantly less abundant in G60 group as compared to L60 group p  0.05.
