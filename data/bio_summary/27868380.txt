Microbial Biotechnol 10 doi 10.1111 1751-7915.124612 Dedicated to all the Olympians who win without resortingto performance enhancing drugs and to those canny microbiologists whose ideas lead to major new discoveries that change our thinking and experimenting and lead to novel applications.3 Performance enhancing drugs httpswada-main-prod.

Of course some enhancers are injected so the gut bugs do not have an impact on the actual dose given and live off tiny amounts excreted into the gut.

When this happens the toxins kill off some gut bug types but amazingly become food for other new bugs which gather round and eat them Detecting these new ones and the absence of those killed by the toxins in the gut microbiome is an even more sensitive signature of doping.

That multivalent microbial dope-sensor product they rub on our heads before the race seems to be pretty power- ful at detecting drugs in sweat.

Well it turns out that they also reflect what drugs we take5.
