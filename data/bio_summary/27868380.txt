Microbial Biotechnol 10 doi 10.1111 1751-7915.124612 Dedicated to all the Olympians who win without resortingto performance enhancing drugs and to those canny microbiologists whose ideas lead to major new discoveries that change our thinking and experimenting and lead to novel applications.3 Performance enhancing drugs httpswada-main-prod.

Of course some enhancers are injected so the gut bugs do not have an impact on the actual dose given and live off tiny amounts excreted into the gut.

When this happens the toxins kill off some gut bug types but amazingly become food for other new bugs which gather round and eat them Detecting these new ones and the absence of those killed by the toxins in the gut microbiome is an even more sensitive signature of doping.

That multivalent microbial dope-sensor product they rub on our heads before the race seems to be pretty power- ful at detecting drugs in sweat.

Well it turns out that they also reflect what drugs we take5.

The impact of the gut microbiota on drug metabolism and clinical outcome.

Terracotta plaque showing Pelops and Hippodameia Metropolitan Museum of Art.use the drugs as food to grow on She got the idea that such bugs could be present in higher quantities in the faeces of people on PEDs than of other people so by determining the numbers and proportions of these bugs in the microbiomes of athletes it might be possible to conclude whether they are taking performance enhancers.

Because gut bugs are not accustomed to PEDs they tend to make more mistakes when digesting them.

Voila the background to the current generation of microbiome PED testsJess Incredible Although I am not too thrilled having a doctor's digit poked up my rear end it is less uncom- fortable than those smart implants they tried out a cou- ple of years ago.Anna wriggling uncomfortably Ooohhh yes Jan tells me that some bugs able to degrade the drug-derived toxins have now been converted into light-emitting beacons that glow when mixed with faecal samples of a PED taker - more or less like the lit-up scalps we saw this morning - so this will probably lead to a third generation test Amazing what neat ideas microbiologists come up withJulio Ok but anyway there is still the unresolved issue of those who supposedly take such drugs as med- ication which is open to all kinds of abuse.Hank Yeah despite the WADA defining the conditions for therapeutic use exemptions7 the issue is still prob- lematic which is why there's an ongoing discussion about legalizing the use of PEDs8.
