To assess causality between the pres- ence of microbiota and contraction frequency GF polyps were recolonized with hydra commensal bacteria and their contraction frequency was measured.

GF polyps incubated in these extracts displayed a significantly higher contraction frequency than GF animals incubated only in hydra medium and these frequencies were only about 12 lower than the control contraction frequency Fig.

The contraction frequency in thus obtained GF animals decreased significantly compared to controls to an average of 4.6 - 0.1 contractions per hour cor- responding to about 60 of the control contraction frequency Fig.

b Spontaneous contractions assessment.The contractile behaviour was described in terms of contraction frequency defined as the number of full body contractions MIN occurred in one hour red arrows the time interval between two consecutive contractions Dt the stretching capacity Smax which is the maximum body elongation MAX achieved after a contraction and the contractile capacity DS the difference in a polyp's shape between MAX and MIN states.Figure 3.

GF polyps recolonized with this microbiota referred to as conventionalized showed significantly higher contraction frequency compared to GF polyps Fig.

The GF status of the polyps was tested twice per week starting at day 19-20 by plating an antibiotic-treated macerated polyp from every replicate produced on R2A agar which supports growth of hydra microbiota.

The conventionalized polyps were washed and transferred to sterile hydra medium 24 hr after colonization.

e Contraction frequency of GF polyps incubated in both microbiota extracts is higher than that ofGF animals incubated in hydra medium alone M.ext.24 h 86.6 - 3.4 rep 5 n  49 M.ext.48 h 87.4 - 3.4 rep 6 n  54 GF 58.6 - 2.6 rep 12 n  110 anova F3351 73.56 P  0.001.

These contractions appeared in a regular temporal pattern with an average interval of 7.32 - 0.14 min and 75 of con- secutive contractions occurred within 10 min-interval.To study the impact of the microbiota on spontaneous contractile behaviour we measured the contraction fre- quency in germ-free GF animals which were obtained by treating H. vulgaris polyps with an antibiotic cocktail using a regime known to completely remove associated bacteria.

We found that the majority of the contractions of both GF and control polyps took place in a similar time frame with most contractions separated by intervals of around 3 min Fig.
