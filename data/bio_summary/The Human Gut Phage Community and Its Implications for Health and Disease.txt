Interestingly risperidone-induced weight gain can be reproduced in mice through transplantation of the fecal phage fraction alone which suggests that healthy phage community transplantation might have positive effects as well .A recent pilot study has shown that the gut phage community by itself may be sufficient to eliminate CDI and promote the recovery of a healthy microbiome structure  Box  Figure .

We also revisit the early ideas of phage therapy albeit applying them at the whole community scale and explore the possible use of bacteriophages to recover the necessary structure of the microbiome and reestablish health.Outcome of Phage-Bacteria InteractionsThe fate of a bacterial cell upon infection with a phage can be either cell death lysis or temporary symbiosis lysogeny chronic infections.

Changes in the phage community associated with a shift towards an elderly-like microbial community are unknown.These analyses showed that the gut is colonized by phages quickly after birth 1-4 days that gut phages are more similar between infants than between adult individuals and that the phage community undergoes considerable changes early in life .

There is a slight decrease in double stranded DNA dsDNA phage diversity specifically of Siphoviridae phages and an increase in single stranded DNA ssDNA phage diversity in infants compared to adults .

Generally the phage community consists of a few dominant DNA phage types with a tail of less abundant phages .

The most abundant phage types can represent more than 15 of the total phage community .

For example phage genome  and phage protein-cluster analysis - or the recently developed Homologous Virus Diversity Index HVDX  reduce the data complexity and enhance virus classification of metagenomic datasets.

Because phage contigs generally represent incomplete phage genomes these numbers are only a lower bound.

The importance of a carrier state of the temperate phage as a non-integrated episome to maintain a stable coexistence of a phage and its host has recently been shown  adding complexity to the studies of lysogeny.

Upon phage infection a small fragment of the invading phage genome of approximately 30 bp known as a spacer sequence becomes incorporated into the bacterial chromosome in a CRISPR array .
