The RiPP cluster abundance analysis was modified to make it similar to the original analysis as follows  non-biosynthetic genes were excluded a cluster was considered present in a metagenome if the total length of the mapped readswas 2 500 bp for at least 50 of its genes any cluster with coverage higher than 50000 bp was assigned the value of 50000 bp and the relative abundance of a cluster was calculated as an average abundance level of its genes.

This discrepancy is likely linked to the fact that although UC is also an inflammatory bowel disease unlike CD it commonly affects certain parts of the intestinal tract is associated with a less extreme gut microbial phe- notype  and is subject to less frequent antibiotic treatment .Profiling of the genes belonging to a recently discovered major gut bacteriophage crAssphage showed that although this phage was present globally its abundance varied across populations worldwide with the highest levels in the USA and China.

The relative abundance distributions for 341 ref- erence bacterial genomes  were estimated from a published dataset of real gut meta- genomes from the Chinese population .

The relative abundance values for each gene were calculated by normalizing total length of successfully mapped reads by gene length and the total number of reads in the metagenomeGene relative abundance 14SuccessfullyXmapped readsRead lengthGene length  Total number of reads in the metagenomeFor each specific gene group of interest its sequences are aligned against the gene catalogue using BLASTn or tBLASTn in cases where the gene group is represented by nucleotide or amino acid sequences respectively with the following similarity criteria e-value  1e-5 per- cent identity  80 alignment lengthquery length  0.8 and alignment lengthsubject length  0.8.

The relative abundance of each gene in a simulated metagenome was defined as the relative abundance of the respective genome.To calculate gene abundances via direct mapping to the reference the simulated metage- nomic reads were mapped to the sequences of the target gene group using Bowtie parameters-t -f -v 3 -k 1.

The relative abundance of each gene in a simulated metagenome was defined as the total length of the mapped reads normalized by the gene length.We calculated correlations between the ground truth and each of our catalogue-based method and direct mapping method using the relative abundance data over a range of control parameter values including the percent identity threshold see .

The wall clock run time statis- tics were as followsDirect mappingConstruction of a Bowtie index for the gene group sequences 1 sMapping of all reads against the gene group reference 30400 sProcessing of all SAM files to yield abundance tables 148600 s.Our catalog-based methodConstruction of a Bowtie index for the global gene catalogue 9000 sMapping of all reads against the global gene catalogue 109200 sProcessing of all SAM files to yield abundance tables 250600 sAlignment of the gene group against the global gene catalogue 1600 s.Therefore in a typical study with 10-100 metagenomes our method becomes computa- tionally more efficient than direct mapping for a gene group of moderate size n  1000 genes due to the exploitation of pre-computed data see .

For example as a part of the MetaHIT project metagenomic reads from 124 gut metagenomes were assembled de novo to obtain a representative 3.3 mln gut microbial gene catalogue  a useful reference for the analysis of new metagenomic datasets.

Recent large-scale studies of world populations identified a rich coun- try-specific diversity of AR genes in gut metagenomes  .The list of the newly examined specific activities of the gut microbiota and the studies highlighting the genes responsible for these functions keeps growing.
