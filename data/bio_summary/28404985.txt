Using E. coli sequence data a database of 240 gnd sequence types gSTs was constructed containing representative 284 bp gnd sequences from all 184 recognised E. coli O serogroups Supplementary Table  28 gSTs from E. coli described as untypable or 'rough' and three new as yet undesig- nated O serogroups.

To provide an indication whether the isolates were E. coli or K. pneumoniae their growth on media containing citrate and urea was investigated.Thirteen isolates were unable to be positively identified as E. coli as GenBank BLAST searches of their respec- tive gSTs obtained using Sanger sequencing indicated a closest match to E. coli andor K. pneumoniae sequences Supplementary Tables and .

Peturbations of the mucin-degrading members of the gut microbiota caused by environmental or dietary factors or invading pathogeniccoli may in turn influence changes in the E. coli microbiota permitting less abundant clones to become dominant.In this work we explored the use of degenerate primers to amplify a segment of the gnd locus to provide an indication of E. coli diversity from cattle and the putative identification of low abundance E. coli types from multiple animals and samples.

Thus recombination events associated with the transfer of O-AGCmay result in novel gSTs but with no change of O-antigenicity.Although on average 30 gSTs were associated with each library some low abundance gSTs with a total count of 10 reads across our P  0.015 test dataset or present in datasets with a lower quality threshold may havebeen overlooked using culture-independent methods.

However the identification of additional low abundance gSTs considered as noise after application of the EC model only provides a minor contribution to community structure where the proportions of the most abundant gSTs remain relatively unchanged.Currently the gnd database generated in this study contains 240 separate gSTs that differ from a consensus sequence by between 3 and 62 SNPs.

The EC model however identifies gSTs by including a specified error based on the respective relative abundance of parent and daughter gSTs and removes gSTs where their relative abundance is assigned a probability of being generated in error.

'Animal' was the main determinantof E. coli diversity with limited impact of sample type or DNA extraction method on intra-host E. coli community variation from faeces and recto-anal mucosal swab samples.

Other cryptic E. coli strains phenotypically indistinguishable from E. coli and more abundant in animal faeces have been identified by multi-locus sequence typing clade-specific sin- gle nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs present in chuA and aesand genome sequencing.

More recently shotgun metagen- omic methods for distinguishing the E. coli microbiota have achieved microbial resolution at the strain-level but may be limited in their resolution in complex samples containing E. coli strains at low abundance-.E.

The O-AGC and adjacent loci are prone to genetic rearrangement with many defined and well-characterised O-antigen somatic serogroups recognised however the isolation of untypable E. coli strains that do not cross-react with available O-antigen antisera is common.The presence of certain E. coli genotypesphenotypes in low numbers in a complex sample may lead to dif- ficulties in their detection and isolation using routine culture media.
