Many gastrointestinal diseases are associated with the shifts of gut microbiota in mammals and lower vertebrates such as fish - and this stimulates the interests in understanding how gut microbial communities are assembled and how they im- pact host fitness.

Since host immunity may alter gut microbial compositions  water quality can mod- ulate the assembly of gut microbiota through its influence on fish immunity   -.

Using 16S rRNA gene Miseq sequencing we compared the gut microbiota in diseased and healthy fish to identify the key bacterialphylotypes that linked with the disease and to determine the environmental factors that may influence the composition and diversity of fish gut microbiota.Materials and MethodsSample Collection and DNA ExtractionSevere Bred-operculum disease outbreaks in cultured crucian carp ponds occurred from the May to August 2015 in Yancheng city Jiangsu province China.

In order to assess the relationship between biodiversity and thestability of fish gut microbiota linear regression analysis was carried out between observed species and alpha variability.ResultsOverall Microbial Community CompositionA total of 131 samples from 4 ponds CB CN S and W were collected from May to August 2015 including 83 gut sam- ples 36 diseased fish and 47 healthy fish 24 water samples 10 from diseased pond and 14 from normal pond and 24 sediment samples 10 from diseased pond and 14 from normal pond Table S1.

Tep and NH3-N strongly correlated the microbial community of fish while two most important factors shaping the community composition of wa- ter were Tep and DO.In addition the correlations between those abundant genera in fish gut mentioned in Table S2 and water physicochemical factors were estimated in order to understand the influence of environmental factors on the gut microbiota.

Thus less diversity and stability of gut microbiota in fish may be associated with diseases.In addition the structure of the fish gut bacterial commu- nity was primarily influenced by the disease even though the sampling location and time had significant impacts on the clustering patterns Fig.

To date few studies have focused on the interactions among environmental factors fish diseases and gut microbi- ota compositions.

We compared the gut bacterial communities of healthy crucian carps Carassius auratus with those of individuals affected by Bred-operculum disease and corre- sponding water and sediment microbiota in four fish farm ponds.

Distinct gut bacterial communities were observed in healthy and diseased fish.
