in the genus level the abundance of parasutterella allobaculum and bifidobacterium in the hso48h group was higher than that in the so48h group whereas only the increases in parasutterella and bifidobacterium were statistically significant p  0.05. after anp induction their abundances significantly increased in the hanp48h group compared with that in the nanp48h group p  0.05. the abundance of alloprevotella candidatussaccharimonas and ruminococcaceaeucg-014 significantly decreased in the hso48h group compared with that of the so48h group p  0.05. after anp induction the abundance of all these three genera decreased in the hanp48h group which was the lowest among the four groups.

compared with theso48h group the abundance of christensenellaceaer-7group rikenellaceaerc9gutgroup and ruminococcaceaeucg-005 significantly decreased in the hso48h group p  0.05. their abundance altered after anp induction and was significantly decreased in the hanp48h group compared with that in the nanp48h group p  0.05. the abundance of anaerotruncus and ruminiclostridium5 decreased after anp surgery and significantly decreased in the hanp48h group compared with that in the nanp48h group p  0.05 .taken together these data suggested that htg and anp might play a vital role in leading to the changes in structure of intestinal microbiota.antimicrobial peptides expression decreased in htg-related anpto investigate the alterations in paneth cell amps expression level during hanp real-time pcr and immunofluorescence were used to measure the mrna and protein expression levels of lysozyme and a-defensin5 in the distal ileum.

each group was then divided into 24h and 48h subgroups respectively so24h so48h nanp24h and nanp48h each group n 10. rats with htg were divided into so group and anp group with 20 rats in each group.

compared to that in the so48h group otu chao 1 and ace index reflected significantly decreased intestinal microbiota diversity in the hso48h group p  0.05. the intestinal microbiota diversity in the hanp48h group significantly decreased compared to that in the nanp48h group which was demonstrated by the estimators of otu chao 1 ace shannon and simpson index.reflected that there was an overall shift in intestinal microbiota structure.

their abundance was the lowest in the hanp48h group and significantly decreased compared with that in the nanp48h group p  0.05. the hanp48h group had the highest abundance of actinobacteria among the four groups and significantly increased compared with that in the nanp48h group p  0.05 .

rats with normal lipid were divided into sham-operated so group and anp group with 20 rats in each group.

intestinal il-1b and il-17a levels significantly increased in the hanp group at 48h compared to those in the nanp48h group and were higher than those in the hanp24h group p  0.05 .

in consistence with the difference between the normal lipid group and the htg group the hanp group also had the decreases in candidatussaccharibacteria and tenericutes in phyla level.

a-diversity estimators in the hanp group revealed decreased microbiota diversity compared with that in nanp group.

each group was then divided into 24h and 48h subgroups respectively hso24h hso48h hanp24h and hanp48h each group n 10.htg rats were fed with hfd 77 normal chow 20 saturated animal fat lard 3 cholesterol and the normal lipid rats with normal chow.

plasma il-1b and il- 17a levels in the hanp group at 48h significantly increased compared with those in the nanp at 48h and were higher than those in the hanp24h group p  0.05. we also evaluated the intestinal inflammatory cytokines expression.

principal coordinate analysis pcoa andnonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds reflected the same results supplementary data.the estimators of community a-diversity shown in  reflected that intestinal microbiota diversity decreased in the hso48h group and the hanp48h group had the lowest diversity among the four groups.

in the phyla level the hso48h group had significant lower abundance of candidatussaccharibacteria and tenericutes compared with that of the so48h group p  0.05. after induction of anp the abundance of these two phyla further reduced.

in our study we found that the microbial diversity in the hanp group decreased significantly compared with that in the nanp group and the structure of intestinal microbiota also had shifts.

similar to that study our results showed that the paneth cell amps lysozyme and a-defensin5 of the htg group were at a lower level than that of the normal lipid group.
