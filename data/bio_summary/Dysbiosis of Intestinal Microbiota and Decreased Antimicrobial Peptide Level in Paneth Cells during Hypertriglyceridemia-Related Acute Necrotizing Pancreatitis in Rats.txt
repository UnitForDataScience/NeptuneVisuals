Principal coordinate analysis PCoA andnonmetric multidimensional scaling NMDS reflected the same results Supplementary Data.The estimators of community a-diversity shown in  reflected that intestinal microbiota diversity decreased in the HSO48h group and the HANP48h group had the lowest diversity among the four groups.

The intestinal microbiota diversity in the HANP48h group significantly decreased compared to that in the NANP48h group which was demonstrated by the estimators of OTU Chao 1 ACE Shannon and Simpson index.reflected that there was an overall shift in intestinal microbiota structure.

The lysozyme staining in the HSO groups decreased compared to that in the SO groups and it further decreased in the HANP groups compared to that in the NANP groups .

Rats with normal lipid were divided into sham-operated SO group and ANP group with 20 rats in each group.

Rats with HTG were divided into SO group and ANP group with 20 rats in each group.

Intestinal IL-1b and IL-17A levels significantly increased in the HANP group at 48h compared to those in the NANP48h group and were higher than those in the HANP24h group p  0.05 .

In consistence with the difference between the normal lipid group and the HTG group the HANP group also had the decreases in CandidatusSaccharibacteria and Tenericutes in phyla level.

a-Diversity estimators in the HANP group revealed decreased microbiota diversity compared with that in NANP group.

Compared to that in the SO48h group OTU Chao 1 and ACE index reflected significantly decreased intestinal microbiota diversity in the HSO48h group p  0.05.

The HANP48h group had the highest abundance of Actinobacteria among the four groups and significantly increased compared with that in the NANP48h group p  0.05 .
