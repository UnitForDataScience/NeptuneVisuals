Understanding the underlying genetic basis and chemical interplay that drive MAPs will provide specific markers for plant breeding  guide the design of microbial consortia  cules incorporated into granules or seed coatings for inundative microbial applications to trigger the beneficial activities associated with a particular MAP .Most plant root exudates and microbial specialized metabolites however are considered as 'public goods' presenting a high potential for cross-talk that may adversely affect MAPS.

The use of recombinant inbred lines to identify microbiome quantitative trait loci microbiome QTLs will be highly instrumental in such efforts  harnessed to connect plant genotypes statistically not only to MAPs but also to the plant metabolites that effectuate them through direct or indirect roles in host selection of microbiota.A confluence of technological advances makes it more feasible than ever to disinter the phylogenetic distribu- tion of microbial and plant traits e.g.

The mathematical MAPs-first approach proposed here involving quantitative profiling of the variation in MAPs across genetically variable hosts followed by the identification of the underlying mechanisms and micro- bial consortia that confer these MAPs will provide a more solid basis to engineer microbiomes to enhance plant growth and plant tolerance to abiotic stress factors.

While throughout our review we draw primarily upon examples from plant-microbe inter- actions we note the broad applicability of our engineering principles for microbiomes of other hosts including the design of microbial consortia for the human gut.MAPs firstA seminal guiding principal to navigate plant microbiome engineering is 'going back to the roots' to re-instate microbial associations on or in plant roots that may have been lost during the domestication process  orduring breeding for disease resistance .

In other words the fitness of the holobiont Nholo may be represented as the sum of the fitness of a germ-free host Napo plus the influence the associated microbiome A has on host fitness a.To quantify the impacts of changes in holobiont fitness DNholo as a result of an altered microbiome DA Equa- tion was also introduced  cially powerful when comparing the impacts of altered microbiomes on germ-free hosts DNapo  0 .

salt and P concentrations or pathogen load to determine the effect on host in both germ-free and microbiome-associated hostment and stability represent key objectives for engineer-ing MAPs .Based on these empirical findings targeted comparative analysis may focus on the plant and microbial traits of only the most significant emergent MAP.

By understanding the functional complementarity of micro- bial consortia on roots or shoots of wild relatives of economically important food crops it should be feasible to identify compatible plant and microbial traits that are essential for plant growth development and health.

We outline strategies for developing 'modular microbiomes' -- synthetic microbial consortia that are engineered in concert with the host genotype to confer different but mutually compatible MAPs to a single host or host population.
