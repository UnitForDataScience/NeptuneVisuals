However as mice matured there was a natural decline in glucose tolerance in control mice whereas VILIRKO mice maintained good glucose tolerance such that by 12 weeks of age VILIRKO mice exhibited slightly better glucose tolerance than con- trols Fig.

Exactly how altered glucose metabolism andor reduced glucose transport in the intestines of VILIRKO mice are related to the reduction in glucose transporter activity will re- quire further investigation.The loss of insulin action and the decrease of glucose uptake in the VILIRKO mice could alter the intestinal milieu resulting in changes in the composition of the gut microbial community and this in turn could further indirectly impact host metabolism.

Despite the reduced glucose absorption we do not observe in- creased fecal caloric content in VILIRKO mice or any sig- nificant change in the community of gut microbiota.We did however find that VILIRKO mice showed a selective reduction in GIP expression by both qPCR and Affymetrix analysis and a reduced number of GIP-positive cells.

In this manner the intestinal IR plays a specific role in fine- tuning glucose homeostasis by regulating glucose uptake and glucose-dependent incretin release.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAnimals and DietsIR and IGF-IR flfl mice on a C57BL6 genetic background were bred with villin-cre mice to obtain IR flfl villin-cre VILIRKO and IGF-IR villin-cre VILIGFRKO mice and their respective flfl littermate controls.

Animal care and study protocols were approved by the Animal Care Com- mittee of Joslin Diabetes Center and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.Metabolic AnalysisTwelve-week-old male VILIRKO and control mice were individually housed and evaluated for ambulatory activity using an OPTO-M3 sensor system CLAMS Columbus Instruments.

Primer sequences are presented in Supplementary Table 1.Microarray Processing and Data AnalysisTotal RNA extracted from jejunal epithelial cells from 6-month-old CD-fed control and VILIRKO mice was analyzed using Affymetrix mouse gene 2.0 chips.

Results are shown as the fold change between control and VILIRKO cells.

All differences except the Affymetrix chip analysis for which the statistical analysis is described above were analyzed by ANOVA or Student t test and were considered significant at P  0.05.RESULTSIntestinal Epithelial InsulinIGF-I Signaling Is Dispensable for Intestinal Growth and DevelopmentTo determine the roles of the intestinal epithelial IR and IGF-IR in intestinal development growth and metabolic function we created mice with an intestinal epithelial- specific deletion of the IR or IGF-IR using Cre recombi- nase under the control of the murine villin promoter hereafter referred to as VILIRKO and VILIGFRKO mice respectively.

To assess the efficiency of the knockout IR mRNA was assessed in isolated epithelial cells from the duode- num jejunum and ileum of control flfl littermates and VILIRKO mice Fig.
