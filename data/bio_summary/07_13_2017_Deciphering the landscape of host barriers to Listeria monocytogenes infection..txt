This discrepancy suggests that MMCs do not play a major role in modulating L. monocytogenes' initial access to and establishment within hepatocytes but that these cells restrict the subsequent expansion of the L. monocytogenes population per- haps by killing L. monocytogenes released from lysed hepatocytes during the later stage of L. monocytogenes proliferation 21 23.Mice were also treated with antibody to TNF-a a cytokine that promotes the activity of macrophages including Kupffer cells in the liver monocytes and neutrophils 27-29.

Even though there was Nb'  9 in the GB samples mean Nb'  3 Nb' range 1-9 the numbers of L. monocytogenes CFUs recovered from these samples were comparable to the numbers found in other tissues Fig.

However none of thesestudies measured Nb sizes in these organs.Here we used STAMP to map L. monocytogenes dissemina- tion routes and quantify Nb sizes following orogastric OG andi.v.

For both infection protocols we found that Nb size was highest for the liver and spleen suggesting that a subset of the OG inoculum escapes from the GI tract before constriction of the L. monocytogenes Nb there.

monocytogenes to establish infection in this model the different Nb sizes in the tested host tissues reveal that additional tissue- specific bottlenecks constrain the capacity of L. monocytogenes to access different host organs.The lowest Nb' values were found in the GB.

The number of CFUs recovered from brain samples was highly correlated with CFU numbers from blood samples R2  0.81 consistent with the model that blood-borne organisms seed the brain.We enumerated CFUs recovered from each of these sites and estimated the size of the Nb by comparing the frequencies of tags in the inoculum with the frequencies in organisms recovered from the different samples yielding Nb and adjusting it with the cali- bration curve yielding Nb' 8.

Notably despite the relatively large Nb' value observed in the colon mean  46 the Nb' value in the feces was very low and similar to the Nb' value in the GB sug- gesting that fecal organisms are not principally derived from intracellular organisms replicating within colonic tissue.Historically many studies have used i.v.

10 studied orogastrically infected guinea pigs to identify routes by which L. monocytogenes disseminates from the intestine to the liver mesenteric lymph nodes MLNs and spleen and they have characterized how L. monocytogenes traffics between ma- ternal organs and the placenta 7 10.

Most 80 ofthe L. monocytogenes cells that reach the liver are thought to be captured and subsequently inactivated by Kupffer cells during the lag phase whereas the remaining L. monocytogenes cells enter hepatocytes where they can replicate 23-25.Mice were treated with an antibody to Gr-1 which is expressed on myelomonocytic cells MMCs including neutrophils and monocytes at doses known to deplete cells bearing this marker 26.

Indeeddeeper understanding of the L. monocytogenes factors that facili- tate its replication in the GB could contribute to the creation of safer live-attenuated L. monocytogenes strains for use as vaccine vectors and in cancer therapeutics 38.Materials and MethodsThe STAMP protocol used here was similar to the STAMP protocol described by Abel et al.
