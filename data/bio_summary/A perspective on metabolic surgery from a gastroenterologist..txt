This observation supports the hypothesis that the proximal small bowel of patients with T2D may produce diabeto- genic factors which is consistent with the anti-incretin theory.Appetite regulationPatients undergoing metabolic surgery have an anorectic status that facilitates weight loss and improves glucose homeostasis.

Different types of metabolic surgeries have different glucose-lowering effects ac- cording to several studies e. A meta-analysis showed different efficacies of T2D remission in patients who underwent BPD 95.1 RYGB 80.3 and gastric banding 56.7 .

In addition it has been hypothesized that jejunal nutrient sensing can be newly estab- lished after metabolic surgery by correcting duodenal nutrient sensing defects in patients with obesity and T2D .

Our ran- domized controlled trial also demonstrated that patients with T2D after either GB or SG exhibit distinct nutrient-induced consumption behaviors and appetite sensations post-operatively in which ABCD score plays some role .ConclusionsThe International Diabetes Federation estimates that the num- ber of patients with diabetes will increase to more than 642 million worldwide by 2040 .

The roles of metabolic surgery such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy gastric banding and biliopancreatic diversion are focused.

Between these treatment options metabolic surgery is the only effective and long-lasting way to remit T2D and lose excessive body weight .

Journal of Pharmacological Sciences 133 2017 61e64Roles of metabolic surgeryMetabolic surgery and other interventional diabetology in- cludes several types such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB A sleeve gastrectomy SG B gastric banding C biliopancreatic diversion BPD D intra-gastric balloon IGB E and duodenal-jejunal bypass liner DJBL F. The types of surgery are divided into malabsorptive procedures restrictive volume procedures and mixed procedures.

It may serve as an adjunct for managing overweight patients with poorly controlled T2D but weight regain is commonly observed during the long-term follow-up after IGB removal .

demonstrated that weight loss induced by IGB was associated with a decrease in the plasma leptin level and a transient increase in the plasma ghrelin level in patients with morbid obesity .Immunometabolism and unidentified factorsEmerging evidence has shown that GB and SG can reduce pro- inflammatory biomarkers and increase the anti-inflammatory mediators of obesity.

The area under the curve AUC for patients' hunger sensation AUC0e180 decreased and the fullness sensation of AUC0e180 increased after RYGB surgery .
