modeled the dewetting mechanisms of hexagonally arranged PDMS micropillar arrays and showed that the alignment of DNA nanowires on top of micropillars ishighly dependent on the direction of dewetting as well as the arrangement of the micropillars.Additionally increasing either the incubation time  A or the initial concentration of S. aureus cells in the saline solution before plating cells B allowed the control of the number of S. aureus cells attached to the top surfaces of micropillars and embedded within biostrings suspended between micropillars as shown in .

S. aureus cells were fixed using 2.5 glutaraldehyde for 2 h and air-dried in a fume hood for 12 h. The PDMS samples were then coated with a 10 nm layer of gold and inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope Zeiss LEO 1550.ASSOCIATED CONTENTS Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the at DOI .Optical images of PDMS platforms of varying micropillar surface coverage SEM image of platforms where bacteria were fixed in solution before plating on PDMS microposts and adhesion patterns of bacteria plated onto PDMS microposts after 1 or 4 h incubation AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding AuthorE-mail .ORCIDFrank X.

During the 1 h incubation of bacterial solution on PDMS micropillars S. aureus cells adhere to the solid surfaces that are available to them specifically the flat PDMS surface and the top surfaces of micropillars.

These studies used wetting dewetting characteristics of PDMS micropillars to deposit and suspend highly ordered arrays of DNA nanowires on top of micropillars.- To test this we fixed S. aureus cells in solution and plated these dead cells onto PDMS micropillar platforms and aspirated the samples after 1 h incubation.

S. aureus cells in a saline solution were plated on the PDMS platform as shown in A and incubated for 1 4 or 24 h. As predicted by wetting studies adhered bacterial cells only remained on the top surface of micropillars when the sample was aspirated after a 1-4 h incubation time B as the saline solution likely did not penetrate between micropillars during this time frame.

Due to their exceptional wetting properties micropatterned hydrophobic surfaces have been used for a variety of applications including macroscopic fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures such as aligned DNA or micellar nanowire arrays.- Our method takes advantage of the wetting properties of PDMS micropillars as well as the adhesion and biofilm formation of S. aureus cells on surfaces to produce nanostrings and rods of S. aureus cells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWetting Properties of PDMS Micropillars by Bacteria Culture Media.

In this study we propose a simple and low-cost physiochemical method pertaining to both physiology and chemistry for patterning S. aureus cells and controlling the architecture ofmicrocolonies of S. aureus cells on polydimethyl siloxane PDMS hydrophobic micropillars.

Furthermore such biostrings were observed on PDMS micropillar arrays of various surface coverages 27- 33 however a higher number of biostrings were obtainable on platforms with higher surface area coverage of micropillars .Next we examined whether the formation of biostrings of S. aureus was due to active adhesion and activity of S. aureus cells or purely a physicochemical phenomenon resulting in a mere deposition of cells during the dewetting process by mechanisms similar to some previous studies.

Cracking of the bacteria film and clustering of micropillars seen for 24 h incubation times are likely caused while drying thesamples for imaging.storage the shape and contact angles of droplets of saline and nutrient broth were measured on a control flat PDMS as well as micropatterned PDMS samples as shown in D. The contact angle of broth on the flat PDMS sample 107deg - 4deg was considerably lower than that of saline 115deg - 3deg  D indicating more repellence between the saline solution and the flat PDMS surface.

E Optical image of PDMS micropillars submerged in saline solution top and nutrient broth solution bottom after 1 h of incubation the solution is pinned at the interface between the micropillars and the flat PDMS surface in saline which indicates the presence of air-gaps formed between the micropillars top.
