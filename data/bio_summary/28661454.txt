The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of ChA on DSS-induced experimental colitis mainly focusing on the composition of the fecal microbiota and colonic inflammation in mice with DSS-induced colitis.In this study 1 mM ChA was ministered to DSS-colitis mice.

A Comparison of the relative abundance of Akkermansia in fecal samples of DSS colitis mice analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing B A comparison of the relative abundance of Akkermansia in fecal samples of normal mice that were treated with ChA.

Thus ChA had an anti-inflammatory effect in the colonic mucosa in colitis mice possibly through suppressing the proinflammatory cytokine secretion.The accumulating data showed that the composition and diversity of the microbiota are altered in IBD patients or in DSS-treated mice .

Thus it will be helpful to explore the effect of ChA on fecal microbiota in DSS-induced colitis to elucidate its anti-inflammatory activity.The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effect of ChA on DSS-induced acute colitis induced by DSS in C57BL6 mice by macroscopic and histological methods.

The anti-inflammatory effect of ChA on DSS-induced colitis symptoms such as body weight loss diarrhea fecal blood and shortening of colon were observed in C57BL6 mice .

The effects of Chlorogenic acid ChA on the disease activity index DAI in dextran sulfate sodium DSS colitis mice.

ChA acted as the intestine-modifying gut microbial community structure resulting in a lower intestinal and systemic inflammation and also improving the course of the DSS-induced colitis which is associated with a proportional increase in Akkermansia.Keywords chlorogenic acid colitis inflammation gut microbiota AkkermansiaIntroductionUlcerative colitis UC is one of the most common chronic inflammatory bowel diseases IBD of unknown etiology .

Our study further suggested that the ability of the ChA administration to raise the relative proportion of Akkermansia which may be in association with this protective effect leading us to propose that polyphenols may prevent colitis through a prebiotic effect on the gut microbiota.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at  Figure S1 Schematic diagram of the experimental study design Figure S2 The effects of ChA on the richness of fecal microbiota in DSS-treated mice.Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China 81473020 and 81502801 a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions the Collegiate Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 16KJB330005.Author Contributions Zhan Zhang developed the study design analyzed data and wrote the manuscript XinYue Wu and Shuyuan Cao contributed to the study concept and design and performed animal testing Hui Yang and Yiming Feng contributed to the study design and were involved in animal testing Yonghua Shen contributed to study design and data analysis Meghan Cromie contributed to manuscript editing Lei Li contributed to study design data analysis and manuscript editing.

Moreover the effect of ChA on gut microbiota of mice that were treated with DSS was also studied.Materials and MethodsAnimal TreatmentFemale C57BL6 mice 18-20 Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. Shanghai China.

Taxonomic bins at the phylum level showed that the DSS-treated mice treated with DSS showed a trend to harbor higher proportions of Firmicutes and lower proportion of Bacteroidetes Figure B. ChA significantly decreased the proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and increased the proportions of Verrucomicrobia in DSS-treated mice Figure BC.Figure 4.
