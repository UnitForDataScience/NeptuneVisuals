show that the intestinal microbiota is required for normal expansion of the pancreatic b-cellpopulation in zebrafish during early larval development.in the first few days after hatching the number of insulin-producingb-cells in zebrafish larvae increases steadily by contrast the authors found that germ-free zebrafishthe intestinal microbiota is required for normal expansion of the pancreatic b-cell populationmaintained the same number of b-cells as they had before hatching.

that induced b-cell expansion which they termed b-cell expansion factor a befa.

moreover the data suggest that befa causes b-cell expansionby increased cell proliferation but it remains to be determined whether this proliferation occurs in progeni- tor cells mature b-cells or both.finally homologues of befa produced by members of the human gut microbiota also induced b-cell proliferation in germ-free zebrafish which suggests that this factor has a conserved role in early development.

research highlights nature reviews microbiology  published online 3 jan 2017 doithe role of the host-associated microbiota in promoting the development of the animal gastro- intestinal tract is well established however the influence of resident microorganisms on the develop- ment of other digestive organs has remained elusive.

isolated from the zebrafish gut restored their b-cell populations whereas other species such as vibrio spp.
