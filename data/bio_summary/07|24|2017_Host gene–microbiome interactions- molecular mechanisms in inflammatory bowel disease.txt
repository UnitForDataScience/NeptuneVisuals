a large body of evidence has revealed a role for nod2 in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota in ibd patients as well as in animal models  with a recent report showing that the gut microbiota is altered in nod2-- mice specifically with an expansion of bacteroides vulgatus a pathobiont .

recently progress has been made in the iden- tification of novel genetic variants associated with ibd and in understanding their relationship with the gut microbiome revealing that the maintenance of bidirec- tional communication at the mucosal interface is critical for sustaining intestinal homeostasis.the role of host genetics in shaping the microbiotathe relationship between host genetics and the compos- ition of the gut microbiota has been explored extensively the heritability of the microbiome and its subse- quent contribution to host health is governed both by extrinsic factors for example mode of delivery breast- feeding diet and by host genetics.

these and other findings clearly show that innate immune sensors and response regulators such as nod2 and card9 respectively limit the expansion of disease-promoting microorganisms in the gut allowing beneficial microbes to thrive and thus contribute to host health.understanding how genetic variants are involved in microbial sensing in ibdthe close interaction between the host and the micro- biota involves the shaping of the microbiota by the host and concurrent signaling from commensal microbes through immune-mediated recognition receptors to pro- mote host tissue and immune development main- taining this bidirectional communication is critical for supporting intestinal homeostasis.

among the susceptibility genes are those involved in intestinal barrier function innate immune recognition of microbial ligands antigen presentation t-cell immunity autophagy and other immune-mediated pathways .the interplay between the gut epithelium and the microbiota has also been implicated as a contributing fac- tor in disease pathogenesis whereby aberrant interactions may result in inflammatory responses to commensal microbes .

the gene encoding caspase recruitment domain 9 card9 another cd susceptibility gene whose product interacts with nod2 was recently found to impact the gut microbiota whereby card9-- mice harbor a more pro-inflammatory population of microbes with impaired tryptophan metabolism .

our work suggests that patients carrying risk alleles of ibd susceptibility genes may be cumulatively affected first in sensing and clearance of intracellular microbes and second in the rec- ognition of immunomodulatory bacterial molecules from the gut microbiota to promote immune tolerance.

it has become understood that the compos- ition of the microbiota is important in directing both thecorrespondence california institute of technology pasadena ca 91125 usalocal and systemic immune responses through which spe- cific beneficial microbes can promote immune homeosta- sis and mucosal tolerance to dampen inflammation .

nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 nod2 a cytosolic innate immune pattern recognition receptor and the first cd susceptibility gene identified has been reported to play key roles in maintain- ing intestinal homeostasis through its detection of pep- tidoglycan from the microbiota.

while the gut microbiome is acquired from birth and stabilizes in the first years of life  it also serves as an environmental sensor that interacts with the host to influence immune phenotypes.

collect- ively dysbiosis of the microbiome and the loss of beneficial commensal microbes along with impairments in these ibd susceptibility genes may lead to chronic sustained mucosal inflammation contributing to ibd pathogenesis.conclusionswhile host genetics and the gut microbiome have separ- ately been considered to be contributing factors to host health and disease in various immune-mediated patholo- gies it is now clear that the synergism between these two players is key to our understanding of the pathogenesis of ibd.

ibd patients harboring risk variants for nod2 are believed to be impaired in bacterial recognition and clearance resultingin sustained intestinal inflammation--a notion supported by studies of nod2-- mice in response to bacterial infections furthermore nod2 stimulation has been shown to activate autophagy a conserved cellular path- way involved in the clearance of intracellular microbes .

card9 impacts colitis by altering gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan into aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands.

a recent study exam- ined the fecal microbiota of over 400 twin pairs and revealed that monozygotic twins harbored more similar microbiomes than dizygotic twins suggesting heritability of specific taxa within the microbiome .

tryptophan metabolites gen- erated by the microbiota have been shown to be important in the mucosal immune response and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr by tryptophan metabo- lites can direct the production of il-22 a cytokine import- ant in intestinal homeostasis.
