Recently progress has been made in the iden- tification of novel genetic variants associated with IBD and in understanding their relationship with the gut microbiome revealing that the maintenance of bidirec- tional communication at the mucosal interface is critical for sustaining intestinal homeostasis.The role of host genetics in shaping the microbiotaThe relationship between host genetics and the compos- ition of the gut microbiota has been explored extensively The heritability of the microbiome and its subse- quent contribution to host health is governed both by extrinsic factors for example mode of delivery breast- feeding diet and by host genetics.

These and other findings clearly show that innate immune sensors and response regulators such as NOD2 and CARD9 respectively limit the expansion of disease-promoting microorganisms in the gut allowing beneficial microbes to thrive and thus contribute to host health.Understanding how genetic variants are involved in microbial sensing in IBDThe close interaction between the host and the micro- biota involves the shaping of the microbiota by the host and concurrent signaling from commensal microbes through immune-mediated recognition receptors to pro- mote host tissue and immune development Main- taining this bidirectional communication is critical for supporting intestinal homeostasis.

Collect- ively dysbiosis of the microbiome and the loss of beneficial commensal microbes along with impairments in these IBD susceptibility genes may lead to chronic sustained mucosal inflammation contributing to IBD pathogenesis.ConclusionsWhile host genetics and the gut microbiome have separ- ately been considered to be contributing factors to host health and disease in various immune-mediated patholo- gies it is now clear that the synergism between these two players is key to our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD.

A large body of evidence has revealed a role for NOD2 in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota in IBD patients as well as in animal models  with a recent report showing that the gut microbiota is altered in Nod2-- mice specifically with an expansion of Bacteroides vulgatus a pathobiont .

While the gut microbiome is acquired from birth and stabilizes in the first years of life  it also serves as an environmental sensor that interacts with the host to influence immune phenotypes.

As probiotics and fecal microbiota transplant therapies become increasingly prevalent for IBD treatment there is also a need to understand the mechanisms by which host immune pathways integrate microbiome- derived signals to promote intestinal homeostasis.

Among the susceptibility genes are those involved in intestinal barrier function innate immune recognition of microbial ligands antigen presentation T-cell immunity autophagy and other immune-mediated pathways .The interplay between the gut epithelium and the microbiota has also been implicated as a contributing fac- tor in disease pathogenesis whereby aberrant interactions may result in inflammatory responses to commensal microbes .

Our work suggests that patients carrying risk alleles of IBD susceptibility genes may be cumulatively affected first in sensing and clearance of intracellular microbes and second in the rec- ognition of immunomodulatory bacterial molecules from the gut microbiota to promote immune tolerance.

It has become understood that the compos- ition of the microbiota is important in directing both theCorrespondence California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA 91125 USAlocal and systemic immune responses through which spe- cific beneficial microbes can promote immune homeosta- sis and mucosal tolerance to dampen inflammation .

A personalized medicine approach that takes into consideration both host genetics and the gut microbiome could serve to predict therapeutic responses in the treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases.
