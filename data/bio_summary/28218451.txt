3B.ITFl modulates colonic T-cell responses and modulatory cytokine releaseAs ITFl are fermented in the colon 21 and influence immu- nity by either direct interaction with intestinal cells 22 or by modulating the immune active fermentation products of mi- crobiota 21 we next studied the colonic immunity colonic integrity microbiota and their SCFAs fermentation products in ITFl-treated animals with reduced diabetes frequency.In the colon we observed that ITFl supplementation enhanced Treg cell and downregulated Th17 cells compared with control NOD mice Fig.

Lastly ITFl-fed mice show enhanced SCFA production as well as a more diverse and balanced gut microbiome.The finding that ITFl but not ITFs dampens the in- cidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice leads to the postulation that only specific dietary fibers promote immu- nity and intestinal homeostasis in autoimmune-prone NOD mice.

5D.ITFl promotes SCFA production and modifies gut microbiota compositionShifts in gut microbiota and SCFA production have been associated with development of autoimmune diabetes 17.Consequently we studied the effect of ITFs on SCFA pro- duction and gut microbiota composition.

ITFl supplementation strengthens gut integrity and barrier function in NOD mice.Representative sections of colon tissues from six independent mice in NOD and ITFl- fed groups were shown.

In addition ITFs have different ef- fects on the gut microbiota as long chains are predominantly fermented in the colon while short chains are already fer- mented in the small intestine 6 10.Dietary fibers may influence the diabetogenic process via effects on gut immunity barrier and microbiota that modu- late T cells involved in autoimmunity 11 12.

Some gut mi- crobiota can support generation of Foxp3 CD4 regulatory T Treg cells and correct the imbalance between Treg and Th17 cells and closely related autoreactive T cells 11 12.

1 in the Supporting Information.ITFl improves gut integrity and barrier functionA healthier colon with a longer length thicker colon mu- cosa and deeper crypts were observed in ITFl-fed NOD mice compared to controls Fig.

ITFl-induced SCFA pro- duction and especially that of butyrate as we observed may have been a causative factor in the enhanced TJ expression and beneficial immunomodulatory effects in the NOD mice.Composition of the gut microbiome and the abundanceof certain bacteria are important factors to influence the progress of T1D in NOD mice 38.

Based onthese findings we hypothesized that dietary fibers that bene- ficially influence the gut microbiota involved in maintaining T cell balances might be instrumental in slowing down or preventing progression of autoimmune diabetes.Here we compared the effects of long-chain ITF ITFl and the more readily fermentable short-chain ITF ITFs on the frequency of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice.

Next-generation sequenc- ing analysis revealed that ITFl enhanced FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio to an antidiabetogenic balance and enriched modulatory Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacilli.Conclusion Our data demonstrate that ITFl but not ITFs delays the development of T1D via modulation of gut-pancreatic immunity barrier function and microbiota homeostasis.KeywordsBarrier integrity  Dietary fibers  Gastroentero pancreatic regulation  Gut micro- biota homeostasis  Immunomodulation  Nutritional intervention  Pancreatic-gut immunity  Type 1 diabetes pathophysiologyAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived November 17 2016Revised January 7 2017Accepted February 2 2017Correspondence Dr. Jia SunE-mail Abbreviations DP degree of polymerization ITF inulin-type fructans ITFl long-chain ITFs ITFs short-chain ITFs NODnonobese diabetic NLRP3 NOD like receptor protein 3 SCFA short-chain fatty acid T1D type 1 diabetes ThT helper TJ tight junction Treg regulatory TThese authors are co-senior authors.Colour online See the article online to view Figs.
