removal data was modeled according to a single exponential decay model in sigmaplot 11.0 systat software inc.results and discussioninfluence of ksg and otcgtm on the respiration of the biomixturebiomixture respiration was monitored after punctual applications of the antibiotics at doses ranging from 0.1 mg kg-1 to 1000 mg kg-1.

as described by  bacteriostatic antibiotics decelerate cellular respiration while on the contrary the effect of bactericidal agents is potentiated during processes of accelerated respiration.

these authors stated that in combination of bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics suppression of respiration by the bacteriostatic agent blocks the bactericidal effect supposedly enhanced by an accelerated respiration.

the composition of this biomixture was previously optimized by in order to maximize the removal of carbofuran and the decrease of residual toxicity in the matrix.experimental proceduresmicrobial respiration in a biomixture in the presence of antibioticsmicrobial respiration was determined using the oxitop control oc 110r system wtw merck and an adapted manometric procedure bywhere mr microbial respiration mm o2 molar mass of oxygen 32000 mg mol-1 rgeneral gas constant 83.14 l  mbar  t tem-perature k v free gas volume in the system l m mol  kbiomixture kg and dp reduction in pressure mbar.o2 consumption was modeled according to a first order model to determine o2 consumption rate constants which were analyzed by means of anova tests to compare regression lines analyses were performed in the statgraphics centurion software version xvii statpoint technologies inc. va usa.mineralization of chlorpyrifos during co-application of antibioticsthe mineralization of 14c-chlorpyrifos was determined through 14co2 production in biometer flasks containing 14co2 traps with 10 ml koh 0.1 m. the biomixture 50 g was weighed into each biometer flask and spiked with commercial chlorpyrifos 50 mg kg-1 and 14c-chlorpyrifos 5000 dpm g-1 and either the commercial for- mulation of ksg or otcgtm to obtain each of the following concentrations of antibiotic 0.1 1 10 100 500 and 1000 mg kg-1.

inhibition in the degradation of pesticides in soils has been observed during the application of chloramphenicol   however this is not an antibiotic of agricultural use.according to our results despite the deceleration in the mineraliza-tion process the disposal of wastewater containing the antibiotics combined in the agry-gent plus r formulation could proceed in this biomixture without jeopardizing the elimination of chlorpyrifos.removal of fungicides in the biomixture during co-application of antibioticsthe effect of the antibiotics was evaluated on the simultaneous removal of four fungicides at a relevant dose of 10 mg kg-1 that could be found in a biomixture used for the disposal of antibiotic-rich wastewater.

as for carbendazim the antibiotics did not affect the net effect of the degrading microbial communities adapted after the first application of metalaxyl.in the cases of the triazoles tebuconazole and triadimenol noevidence of removal was achieved in the biomixture even in the absence of the antibiotics c d. these compounds exhibit long half-lives in soil ranging from 47 d in the field to 365 d under laboratory conditions for tebuconazole and 65 d to 137 d for triadimenol .

on the contrary otcgtm depressed the respiration of the biomixture and the initial mineralization rate of 14c-chlorpyrifos nonetheless the antibiotics did not decrease overall mineralization values.

in a previous study otc alone produced mostly a stimulation of the biomixture respiration in the same doses assayed  which indicates that either gtm alone or the interaction between both antibiotics produces a negative effect on this parameter.

ksg produced two different patterns according to the dose a low doses resulted in lower final respiration values than the control 1 to 25 lower on the contrary the highest doses 500 mg kg-1 and 1000 mg kg-1 significantly increased the final oxygen consumption around 50. this trend was also observed considering the dose-effect curve plotting the oxygen consumption rate constants k b.in the case of otcgtm  a decrease in the biomixture respiration was observed for every single antibiotic dose according to the final oxygen consumption values 19 to 43 lower than the control nonetheless the degree of such decrease did not follow a clear dose-pattern.

the dose-response plot of the consumption rate constants revealed that some doses produced higher respiration rates than the control despite the apparent inhibition in final consumption due tofaster initial respiration that eventually slowed.

nonetheless the effect reported by regarding individual application of the bacteriostatic otc contradicts the findings by these authors.there are no studies on biomixture respiration in the presence ofantibiotics nevertheless their effect on soil respiration has revealed mixed findings reason why every case should be individually analyzed.

given that respiration does not correlate directly with degrading capacity and that respiration alterations may respond only to anti- biotic-sensitive but not degrading populations the fate of the pesticides in the matrix was directly assayed to determine the alteration in the biomixture performance.effects of ksg and otcgtm on the mineralization of 14c- chlorpyrifosin the case of ksg  the sigmoidal curves fitted to the gompertz model revealed a marked stimulation of 14c-chlorpyrifos mineralization particularly at low antibiotic doses only the dose of 1000 mg kg-1 produced a lower rate than the control.

we assayed the effect of two commercial formulations of antibiotics used in agriculture one containing kasugamycin ksg and the other oxytetracycline plus gentamicin otcgtm on the biomixture performance.

these findings reveal that wastewater containing these antibiotics do not affect the performance of bps.
