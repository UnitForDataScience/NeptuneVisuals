The relative distribution is similar to that previously observed in the feces of post-weaning piglets 40-day-old using 16SrRNA genes sequencing Pajarillo et al.

The incidence of diarrhea  was calculated as the total number of diarrheal piglets during the period divided by the total number of piglets multiplies duration of feeding trial.Sample collectionsAt the end of the feeding trial eight pigs from each dietary treatment were randomly selected based on the similar body weight and humanely euthanized.

The impor- tance of these genera for piglets gut health after receiving fresh FSM contained diets should be investigated further.In the current study Escherichia Streptococcus andStenotrophomonas were in lower abundance in fresh FSM fed piglets.

The concentration of SCFA is showed as ng per gram of digesta.Data analysisThe MOTHUR software package was used to process and analyze the sequences Schloss et al.

The pyrosequencing errors and noises were removed by pre-cluster command in the MOTHUR package v1.14.0 Huse et al.

The clas- sification of sequences was analyzed using software RDP Ribosomal Database Project Multi Classifier at 50 confidence Wang et al.

The ratio of the light gray color area to the dark colorarea in each pie represents the ratio of the relative abundance of the corresponding genus in the control to that of in the treatmentTable 7 Diversity estimates for colon contents from control and treat- mentChao 1 estimator of species402471OTUs operational taxonomic unitsTable 8 Diversity estimates for cecum contents from control and treatmentChao 1 estimator of species429497OTUs operational taxonomic unitsthat pigs fed dried fermented soybean meal have improved growth performance feed efficiency energy and nutrient digestibility Jones et al.

The reduction can be considered beneficial because increased Proteobacteria have been asso- ciated with intestinal inflammation Mukhopadhya et al.

The higher rela- tive abundance of genus Prevotella could be a result of the higher enzyme contents of the fresh FSM because Prevo- tella are known to be involved in fiber fermentation in the intestine Castillo et al.

In this study high-throughput sequencing-based compositional analysis of the cecal and colonic microbiota showed appar- ent differences in relative abundance of bacterial phyla and genus between the control and fresh FSM fed piglets indi- cating that fresh FSM had an effect on the gut microbiota.The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing approach detected seven different bacterial phyla in the cecum and colon in 42-day- old piglets with Firmicutes dominating followed by Bac- teroidetes and Proteobacteria or Actinobacteria in colon of treatment piglets.
