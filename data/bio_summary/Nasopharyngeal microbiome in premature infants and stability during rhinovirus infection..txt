In this context it is noteworthy that recent longitudinal studies6-8 have demonstrated that by 2 months of age most humans develop a stable NP microbiota with low intrasubject variability and dominance of specific genera.8 Interestingly the individual NP microbiome predominance reflects environmental exposures eg antibiotics daycare siblings etc6-8 and predicts subsequent risk to develop respiratory conditions including viral respiratory infections pneumonia and asthma.3-8 Specifically while NP microbiota dominated by Corynebacterium or Alloiococcus clusters is linked to less respiratory morbidity7 8 early NP colonization with Streptococcus Moraxella or Haemophilus is associated with an increased risk for pneumonia or bronchiolitis in earlyPerez et al.Page 7childhood.3-8 We speculate that the presence of multiple environmental challenges may prevent or delay the establishment of a stable NP microbiome in PM infants which may play a pivotal role in the generation of prematurity-related acute and long-term respiratory complications.

This notion has led to the emergent and potentially powerful idea of assessing the NP microbiota of newborns and infants to underpin early-life exposures and host immune responses that determine the initiation and progression of respiratory disorders in humans.3-8 Indeed recent studies have established that the early NP microbial composition correlates with individual nasal cytokine signatures3 frequency and severity of upper and lower respiratory infections4-8 as well as subsequent asthma risk.5-8 In turn the infant NP microbiota is a reflection of early exposures eg breastfeeding antibiotics viral infections daycare etc which critically shape bacterial composition and airway responses against respiratory viruses.8The NP airway of infants born severely premature PM undergoes dramatically different early-life exposures in the neonatal intensive care unit NICU.

The impact of this work is that it presents for the firstPerez et al.Page 3time to the best of our knowledge a potentially modifiable environmental factor prematurity-related NP microbiome that may contribute to the previously described abnormal nasal airway immune responses and high risk for severe viral respiratory infections in PM infants during their first 2 years of life.910 This new knowledge may ultimately lead to novel approaches to predict and prevent potentially life-threatening respiratory complications in this vulnerable population.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy population and nasal samplingTwo nasal washes W1 and W2 were collected from children aged 6 months to 2 years enrolled in the Viral Immuno-genetic Responses of the Airways and the Lungs VIRAL cohort at Children's National Medical System.9-12 The VIRAL cohort is a longitudinal study of children admitted to the hospital with suspected viral respiratory infections.

Nonetheless FT showed overall greater mean diversity than PT for all four indexes compared while RV and non-virus comparison showed more similar estimates for the same indexes data not shown.DISCUSSIONThe NP microbiota of newborns and infants plays a key role in modulating airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms during viral infections.8 We have shown that severely PM infants 32 weeks GA have abnormal nasal airway immune responses against viruses9 10 but it is unknown if the NP microbiota of PM infants differs from that seen in FT individuals and if this difference is maintained during viral infections.

However it is currently unknown if the NP microbiota of PM infants is altered relative to full-term FT individuals.Objectives--To characterize the NP microbiota differences in preterm and FT infants during rhinovirus RV infection.Methods--We determined the NP microbiota of infants 6 months to 2 years of age born FT n6 or severely PM32 weeks gestation n7.

Prior studies have established that RV and respiratory syncytial virus increase the abundance of Streptococcus Moraxella and Haemophilus.7 8 33 Teo et al8 have shown that Haemophilus is rarely found in healthy NP samples of infants but is common during and shortly after acute viral respiratory infections.

Given that viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of hospitalization and death in PM infants3536 these studies may have a significant impact leading to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve respiratory outcomes in this vulnerable population.AcknowledgmentsWork partially supported by Parsons Foundation Grant grant numbers NHLBIHL090020 K12 Genomics of Lung NICHCHD001399 K12 Child Health Research Career Development Award UL1TR000075 KL2TR000076.

Early respiratory microbiota composition determines bacterial succession patterns and respiratory health in children.

We have shown that beyond the NICU stage severely PM infants born 32 weeks gestational age GA have persistent abnormal nasal airway immune responses against respiratory viruses during the first 2 years of life910 however it is unknown if the NP microbiota of PM infants is also persistently different during early childhood relative to infants born at term.In this study we contrasted the NP microbiota of infants 6 months to 2 years of age born full term FT or severely PM.

We did not identify children with NP dominance of Corynebacterium or Alloiococcus likely because these two clusters are associated with healthy children without a history of respiratory infections78 in our sample all FT subjects had a history of RV infection.
