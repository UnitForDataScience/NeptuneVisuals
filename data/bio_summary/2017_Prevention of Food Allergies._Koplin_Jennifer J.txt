The HealthNuts study in Australia provided the first evidence that a directly measured vitamin D level is associated with the risk of food allergy infants with vitamin D levels less than 50 nmolL at 1 year of age had an increased risk of challenge-confirmed peanut allergy at 1 year of age by 11-fold adjusted odds ratio aOR 11.51 95 CI 2.01-65.79 and egg allergy nearly 4-fold aOR 3.79 95 CI 1.19-12.08.However a smaller n 5 274 case-control study also in Australia did not find an association between vitamin D insufficiency at birth or 6 months of age and food allergy at 1 year of age.A cross-sectional study in New Zealand reported a 2-fold increased risk of parent-reported doctor-diagnosed food allergy in children aged 2 to 5 years with vitamin D levels greater than 75 nmol L compared with those with vitamin D levels of 50 to 74 nmolL although measure- ment of vitamin D levels occurred after 2 years of age rather than in infancy when food allergy is likely to have developed.There may be a U-shaped association that is an increased risk in individuals with both low and high levels of vitamin D as has been suggested for high IgE levels.Well-designed randomized controlled trials RCTs are needed to assess the role of vitamin D supplementation as a preventative strategy for food allergy and to establish whether vitamin D has a causal role in the development of food allergy.

Several studies have shown higher rates of food allergy adrenaline-autoinjector prescriptions and hospital admissions for food-related anaphylaxis in children living further from the equator and those born in winterautumn compared with summerspring both proxies of low vitamin D levels.Vitamin D is associated with immune functioning and it has been shown to suppress the T-helper type 2 Th2 response which is associated with B-cell production of IgE antibodies and food allergy however the exact immunologic mechanisms driving the role of vitamin D in the development of food allergy have not been established.Direct evidence assessing vitamin D levels in infants and the risk of food allergy has only recently become available.

The VITALITY study an RCT investigating the use of vitamin D supple- mentation in infancy to prevent food allergy is currently underway.ProbioticsObservational studies have shown that factors associated with increased microbial exposure such as exposure to pet dogs living on a farm childcare attendance and the presence of older siblings may have a protective effect against developing food allergy.The role that microbial exposure may play in the development of food allergy is described by the hygiene hypothesis which postulates that a lack of exposure to microbes and infections in early childhood increases susceptibility to allergic disease by modulating the development of the immune system.The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development and healthy functioning of the immune system and its role in the development of food allergy has been a subject of interest in the scientific community.

They found no evidence to support that probiotic supplementation reduced the risk of food allergy although probiotic use in pregnancy breastfeeding and infancy reduced the risk of eczema in infants with low-certainty evidence requiring caution in interpretation of these findings.In 2016 another meta-analysis found that pro- biotic supplementation when administered both prenatally and postnatally reduced the risk of food sensitization RR 0.77 95 CI 0.61-0.98 although there was no pro- tective effect demonstrated when probiotics were administered only prenatally RR 1.01 95 CI 0.66-1.55 or only postnatally RR 1.43 95 CI 0.94-2.18.Further studies on the use of probiotics as a prevention strategy for food allergy using challenge-proven outcomes are needed.Eczema PreventionA history of eczema is one of the strongest known risk factors for food allergy.

One in 5 infants with eczema had challenge-confirmed allergy to egg white peanut or sesame by 12 months of age compared with only 1 in 25 infants without eczema.The risk of food allergy increased with an earlier age at onset and increasing severity of eczema with approximately 50 of infants whose eczema started in thefirst 3 months of life and required treatment with topical corticosteroids developing a food allergy.Skin barrier dysfunction is a feature of eczema and is thought to play an important role in the initiation of allergic sensitization and subsequent progression to food allergy and other allergic disease.Therefore prevention of eczema in early life may have a follow-on effect of preventing food allergy and other allergic diseases later in childhood.

Per protocol analysis showed a significant reduction in food sensitization at 12 months of age in the inter- vention group 0 vs 19.4 P 5 .04 although this was not significant on intention-to-treat analysis.The results of this pilot study are promising further larger trials are needed incorporating challenge-proven food allergy outcomes to assessthe potential of eczema prevention as a preventive strategy for food allergy.SUMMARYNew food allergy prevention strategies focused on promoting timely introduction of allergenic foods predominantly peanut into the infant diet have been introduced in several countries.

There are differences in allergic responses to different food allergens and differences in the natural history of food allergy with individuals more likely to outgrow their milk and egg allergy early in life compared with peanut allergy.There is also some evidence of a variation in risk factors for different food allergy phenotypes.In addition the usual timing and amount of allergen given in the infant diet differs for different foods with foods such as tree nuts and shellfish often not given until later in childhood.

Of the 5300 participating infants 3.0 were peanut allergic 9.0 egg allergic and 0.8 sesameallergic.Recently there have been new publications reporting the prevalence of food allergy in infants in South Africa and China both countries where food allergy was previously considered to be rare.

In an egg allergy trial giving high doses of egg powder at 4 to 6 months of age to high-risk children with eczema seemed to be associated with some reduction in egg allergy risk compared with egg avoidance until 8 months of age however the difference be- tween groups did not reach statistical significance and 31 of infants in the early egg introduction group had a reaction when the egg powder was first given suggesting that egg allergy was already present at this early age in a significant proportion of infants with eczema.A large trial of multiple allergenic food introductions from 3 to 6 months of age compared with standard introduction from 6 months of age did not find a significant difference in food allergy risk between the two groups in the primary intention-to-treat analysis.There are several possible explanations for this finding including low compliance with the intervention protocol because a per- protocol analysis showed a possible protective effect of earlier introduction of both egg and peanut in those who were compliant with the intervention.

Observational studies also suggest potentially different windows of opportunity for optimal introduction of different foods with cow's milk introduction potentially needing to be earlier than egg or peanut.There may not be a one-size-fits-all approach to preventing all food allergy and the definition of timely introduction may be allergen specific.Tree nuts are some of the most common foods to cause IgE-mediated allergic re- actions and account for around 18 to 40 of all fatal food reactions.Despitethis there have been far fewer studies of tree nut allergy prevalence and risk factors compared with peanut allergy.
