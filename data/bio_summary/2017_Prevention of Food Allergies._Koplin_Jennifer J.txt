to test the hypothesis that earlier introduction of peanut could prevent peanut allergy in high-risk children the group then mounted an intervention trial the learning early about peanut allergy leap study whereby children with severe eczema andor egg allergy were randomly assigned to either start eating peanut from 4 to 11 months of age or completely avoid peanut until 5 years of age.infants were first screened for possible peanut allergy by skin prick testing and 11 of the screened infants were excluded from the study because they were already likely to be peanut allergic at 4 to 11 months of age skin prick test wheal size 4 mm.

the healthnuts study in australia provided the first evidence that a directly measured vitamin d level is associated with the risk of food allergy infants with vitamin d levels less than 50 nmoll at 1 year of age had an increased risk of challenge-confirmed peanut allergy at 1 year of age by 11-fold adjusted odds ratio aor 11.51 95 ci 2.01-65.79 and egg allergy nearly 4-fold aor 3.79 95 ci 1.19-12.08.however a smaller n 5 274 case-control study also in australia did not find an association between vitamin d insufficiency at birth or 6 months of age and food allergy at 1 year of age.a cross-sectional study in new zealand reported a 2-fold increased risk of parent-reported doctor-diagnosed food allergy in children aged 2 to 5 years with vitamin d levels greater than 75 nmol l compared with those with vitamin d levels of 50 to 74 nmoll although measure- ment of vitamin d levels occurred after 2 years of age rather than in infancy when food allergy is likely to have developed.there may be a u-shaped association that is an increased risk in individuals with both low and high levels of vitamin d as has been suggested for high ige levels.well-designed randomized controlled trials rcts are needed to assess the role of vitamin d supplementation as a preventative strategy for food allergy and to establish whether vitamin d has a causal role in the development of food allergy.

it is not clear what to recommend for coun- tries with a low prevalence of peanut allergy and low peanut consumption in infancy which seems to be the case in singapore.other areas of asia also report low rates of peanut allergy although data on infant peanut consumption have not yet been re- ported.although changes to infant feeding practices in these countries currently seem unnecessary it may be advisable to continue to monitor any changes in peanut allergy prevalence with increases in industrialization.barriers to achieving optimal timing of introduction of allergenic foodsin order for infant feeding guidelines to be effective in reducing the population preva- lence of peanut allergy these guidelines need to result in changes in behavior.

to date there have also been no prevention trials for tree nut allergy with exist- ing research focusing on peanut egg and cow's milk allergies.how relevant is early peanut introduction in countries with low peanut allergy prevalencein countries with a low prevalence of peanut allergy where peanut is already intro- duced early such as israel changes are unlikely to be required because the current practice seems to be safe and effective.

however it will be important to monitor both awareness and uptake of these recom- mendations to ensure high compliance with earlier peanut introduction particularly among infants with eczema or egg allergy.the issue of whether high-risk infants should undergo screening for peanut sensiti- zation before the first introduction of peanut into the diet remains the subject of debate.currently some countries such as australia recommend early introduction of peanut for all infants without screening in a setting where infants at highest risk particularly those with other food allergies are often already under the care of an aller- gist.

the relative efficacy of these different strategies for both promoting timely peanut introduction and prevent- ing peanut allergy remains to be seen.is there a role for other prevention strategies apart from timing of introduction of allergenic foodschanging the age at which infants are exposed to individual allergenic foods such as peanut has been shown to have an allergen-specific protective effect for peanut al- lergy but is unlikely to have a broader protective effect for all food allergies.

this advice was removed from most of these guidelines around 2008. the authors pre- viously documented an evolving significant shift toward earlier introduction of peanut and egg 1 year after the removal of advice to delay peanut introduction in 2008. overall however less than 10 of the population changed their practices between 2007 and 2011 there was no significant change in the group with a family history of allergy who might benefit the most from early allergen introduction because of their increased food allergy risk.there may now have been a larger shift toward earlier introduction of allergenic foods because updated guidelines specifically recommend early introduction including for those at high risk of food allergy and because of widespread media reporting of the trial results showing early introduction of peanut is protective.

finally there is as yet no evidence as to whether early introduction of peanut is equally effective in infants without eczema or egg allergy in infancy a pop- ulation in which approximately one-quarter of all peanut allergy cases occur.preventing food allergy through timely introduction of allergenic foods are all food allergies the sameit is not clear that timely introduction of allergens into the diet will be equally effective for preventing all food allergies.

per protocol analysis showed a significant reduction in food sensitization at 12 months of age in the inter- vention group 0 vs 19.4 p 5 .04 although this was not significant on intention-to-treat analysis.the results of this pilot study are promising further larger trials are needed incorporating challenge-proven food allergy outcomes to assessthe potential of eczema prevention as a preventive strategy for food allergy.summarynew food allergy prevention strategies focused on promoting timely introduction of allergenic foods predominantly peanut into the infant diet have been introduced in several countries.

one in 5 infants with eczema had challenge-confirmed allergy to egg white peanut or sesame by 12 months of age compared with only 1 in 25 infants without eczema.the risk of food allergy increased with an earlier age at onset and increasing severity of eczema with approximately 50 of infants whose eczema started in thefirst 3 months of life and required treatment with topical corticosteroids developing a food allergy.skin barrier dysfunction is a feature of eczema and is thought to play an important role in the initiation of allergic sensitization and subsequent progression to food allergy and other allergic disease.therefore prevention of eczema in early life may have a follow-on effect of preventing food allergy and other allergic diseases later in childhood.

other studies of earlier egg introduction have also mostly reported a nonsignificant reduction in egg al- lergy with earlier egg consumption.a recent systematic review and meta-analysis combined data from all of these studies and reported a reduction in egg allergy withintroduction at 4 to 6 months of age compared with later introduction risk ratio rr 0.56 95 ci 0.36-0.87 p 5 .009. the same meta-analysis showed a potentially greater reduction in peanut allergy with early introduction rr 0.29 95 ci 0.11-0.74 with early introduction defined as 4 to 11 months of age.how much food allergy can we prevent through timely introduction of allergenic fooddespite the great success of the early peanut introduction trial likely peanut allergy defined as a skin prick test wheal size 4 mm was already present in around 11 of high-risk infants screened at 4 to 11 months of age.

the authors recently reported that tree nuts were the second most common cause of food allergy in the adolescent age group after peanut affecting 2.3 of the population.there have been no studies of tree nut allergy in infants or young children thus it is not known whether tree nut allergy like peanut al- lergy also develops during infancy and whether it shares similar risk factors to peanut allergy.

prevention of food allergies jennifer j. koplin phd rachel l. peters phd katrina j. allen mbbs fracp phdintroductiona population-level approach to food allergy prevention moved one step closer in 2015 to 2016 with a successful trial of early peanut introduction for preventing peanut al- lergy.

importantly these baseline data will allow us to measure the extent to which new interventions including a shift toward earlier intro- duction of dietary peanut alter the prevalence of food allergy.prevention of food allergy through timely introduction of allergenic foodsin the late 1990s most expert guidelines for prevention of allergic disease internation- ally recommended delayed introduction of allergenic solids such as egg and peanut until after 2 to 4 years of age based on theoretic concerns regarding immaturity of the infant immune system.

there are differences in allergic responses to different food allergens and differences in the natural history of food allergy with individuals more likely to outgrow their milk and egg allergy early in life compared with peanut allergy.there is also some evidence of a variation in risk factors for different food allergy phenotypes.in addition the usual timing and amount of allergen given in the infant diet differs for different foods with foods such as tree nuts and shellfish often not given until later in childhood.
