A third group of isolates Art4 Koc9 Mcc5 Mcc9 Mic8 Ste1 Str Pse3 Pse5 Pse6 Pse8 and Pse9 in Supplementary Table S2 corresponded to those characterized by a production of siderophores along with lytic enzymes or auxins Group C. The last andmajor group of isolates in the PCA analysis corresponded to a tax- onomically heterogeneous set of bacteria 33 genera that presented various moderately expressed plant-growth-promoting activities either individually or in combination Group D. Thus isolates from Group D that were able to produce indoleacetic acid 79 isolates were tax- onomically well distributed--with 19 genera presenting at least one auxin-producing isolate--and with most belonging to Microbacterium 1679 Arthrobacter 1379 Kocuria 1279 Micrococcus 1379 Bacillus 679 and Rhizobium 679.

The taxonomic typification of the isolates recovered from the 6 different alfalfa varieties detected the presence of bacteria that be- longed to fifteen of the genera that we recognized in the alfalfa-seed endophytes together with bacteria included in 6 new genera Corynebacterium Flavobacterium Georgenia Sphingobium Novosphingobium and Stenotrophomonas that had not been detected in our previous assays with seed exudates.

The bacteria from the several genera with remarkable activities of siderophore production in combination with lytic-enzyme activities or auxin synthesis were sequestered as a separate group in the PCA analysis Group C. In contrast to the isolates from Group A bacteria from Group B Group C Group D and Group E were found to be both seed and plant endophytes.

demonstrates that the more prevalent activities varied depending on the specific genera under consideration with the Bacillus isolates having a remarkable presence of hydrolytic enzymes and fungal-in- hibitory activities and members of the Pantoea genus exhibiting notable phosphate-solubilization activity as well as siderophore plus in- doleacetic-acid production and cellulase activity.A PCA based on the set of activities present in each individual iso-late  indicated that the endophytes located at the rightmost position of the plot corresponded to seed isolates from the genus Ba- cillus i. e. the isolates Bac2 Bac3 Bac4 Bac6 Bac12 Bac22 Bac23 and Bac24 in Table S2 that combined several hydrolytic activities proteases amylases pectinases and cellulases together with fungal- inhibitory activity Group A.

Other sources of heterogeneity may arise from dif- ferences in the seed genotypes themselves and also from differences in the plant and soil microbiomes associated to the production of each seed batch.Colonization by seed endophytes of alfalfa plants derived from surface- sterilized seeds and grown under axenic conditionsIn order to evaluate whether seed-borne endophytes were able to colonize alfalfa plants surface-sterilized seeds were grown axenically in plastic tubes and one month after germination the plant seedlings were analyzed to test for the presence of culturable bacteria cf.

The endophytes from Bacillus for one which genus is a frequent seed en- dophyte in several plant species   --together with the isolates from 19 other genera that were found here exclusively in seeds  Table S1--constitute useful germplasm to investigate the phenotypic char- acteristics of these endophytes underlying their preference to colonize seeds.

The upper-left region of the PCA corre- sponded to mostly isolates of the Pantoea genus together with two isolates from the Enterobacter and Exiguobacterium genera Pan1 Pan2 Pan3 Pan4 Pan5 Pan8 Pan10 Pan11 Pan12 Ent2 and Exi4.

With respect to siderophore production 57 isolates from 50 of the genera included in Group D proved to be positive for that trait with most of those isolates pertaining to the genera Arthrobacter 1057 Bacillus 4 57 Pseudomonas 357 Kocuria 957 Rhizobium 457 and Mi- crococcus 457.

The broad diversity of seed endophytes identified and characterized in this work demonstrated that the bacteria carried by alfalfa seeds represent a wide spectrum of taxa which strains in many instances were able to colonize the plant at an early time after germination.
