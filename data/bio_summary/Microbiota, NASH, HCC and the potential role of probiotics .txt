recently failed to detect any metabolic or inflammatory changes resulting from the antibiotic-dependent gut microbiota shrinkage in obese subjects.Intestinal microbiota and liver diseasesA general agreement on the role of intestinal microbiota in colo- rectal cancer genesis has been reached  but only sporadic data exist on the linkage with other tumors.

Beyond the known risk factors for NAFLD the intestinal microbiota in particular dysbiosis defined as any change in the composition of the microbiota commonly found in healthy conditions is emerging as a new factor promoting the development of chronic liver diseases and HCC.

In particular the relationship between liver and gut may also play a crucial role in this complex network of multiple interac- tions .The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the potential role of the intestinal microbiota in the patho- genesis and development of chronic liver diseases in particular NAFLD and the subsequent development of HCC.Intestinal microbiota a new 'organ'General assessmentIn recent times the neglected and amorphous mass of intestinal bacteria has been promoted to the dignity of an actual organ interacting with other organs of the body both in physiology and pathology.The human colon harbors bacteria that reside within and colonize the gastrointestinal tract i.e.

More recently changes in the composition of the microbiota may also occur in humans only one day after changes in diet .The role of dysbiosisRecent studies have shown the emerging role of dysbiosis defined as any change in the composition of the microbiota than that commonly found in healthy conditions in the pathogenesis of several diseases including inflammatory bowel disease aller- gies and metabolic disorders .

The ob-ob mice homozygous for the obese mutation have an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota compared to the respective wild- type with an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease of Bacteroides so called 'obese microbiota' hence the increased capacity to harvest energy from diet .

Alterations in intestinal microbiota seem to play an important role in the development of NAFLD and multiple molecular path- ways have been postulated to explain the relationship between NAFLD and dysbiosis  .As stated above  several changes in the composition of intestinal microbiota occur in the course of obesity including an increase in the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio and a reduction of gut bacterial richness.

Alternatively the whole microbiota can be reconstructed by fecal microbial transplan- tation FMT  representing the process of transplant- ing the fecal bacteria community from a healthy individual to a recipient whose microbiota has been altered.

Currently unsettled issues include the relative role of a 'negative microbiota' in addition to the other known risk factors for NASH and the putative prevention of NAFLD through modulation of the gut microbiota.IntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma HCC is the third cause of cancer death worldwide .

A member of the intestinal microbiota has to fulfill several requirements a metabolic apparatus fit for available nutri- ents the ability to escape the host immune response and to replicate quickly enough to avoid expulsion through the anal canal.

The intestinal microbiota is also involved in inflammationmechanisms redox stress damage motility angiogenesis pro- liferation differentiation fat storage regulation carcinogenesis cancer-response to chemotherapy and even cognitive function .A significant inter-individual variability of intestinal micro- biota exists and the host genotype is probably a key factor in this variability .
