markedly the body weight weight gain food intake body fat percentage and epididymal fat in the gml group were significantly increased p  0.001 p  0.001 p  0.001 p 0.037 and p 0.047 respectively compared to those of the con group figure 1a.

interestingly the anti-inflammatory genus akkermansia and lupinus in the gml group was signifi- cantly decreased p 0.009 while the pathogenic genus turi- cibacter bradyrhizobium and escherichia in the gml group were significantly increased p 0.016 p 0.004 and p 0.047 re- spectively compared to those of the con group figure 4a.

interestingly he histopathology demonstrated that the size of stained fat droplets of epididymal adipose tissue in the gml group were significantly larger p  0.001 than that of the con group but not for the stained fat droplets of liver figure 1b c. meanwhile the frequency of 500-1000 mm2 of stained fat droplets of epididymal adipose tissue in the gml group were sig- nificantly decreased p  0.01 and the frequency of more than 1500 mm2 of fat droplets in the gml group tended to increase compared to the con group figure 1b.

importantly akkerman- sia muciniphila and lupinus luteus in the gml group were sig- nificantly decreased by 29.9 times p 0.009 and 3.6 times p 0.013 respectively whereas bacteroides acidifaciens and es- cherichia coli in the gml group were significantly increased by1.5 times p 0.036 and 4.3 times p 0.046 respectively com- pared to those in the con group.the predictive functions of the microbiota genes are shown in figure 5. the different metabolism pathways belonged to the carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism and lipidfigure 3. gml altered the diversity and communities of gut microbiota.

however the relative abundance of lps-suppressing phyla verrucomicrobia in the gml group showed a significant decrease compared to the con group p 0.009. furthermore the con group consisted of an obviously higher relative abun- dance of sequences belonging to the lps-producing phyla pro- teobacteria 5.86 than the gml group 4.46 p 0.075 but no significant difference was observed figure 3c.

moreover the body muscle percentage and liver weight were significantly decreased in the gml group p  0.001 and p 0.045 respectively compared to the con group.

our study revealed that gml significantly reduced the b-diversity pa- rameter of gut microbiota at the week 8 compared to the con group figure 3a b. interestingly pcoa plot demonstrated the samples between the gml and con groups is not rather dif- ferent but significant p 0.033 at the week 8 meanwhile the samples in the gml group were clustering intensively and grad- ually away from the con group suggesting that gml altered the communities of gut microbiota in a characteristic direction figure 3b.
