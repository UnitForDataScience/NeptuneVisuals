Studies on the bioavailability of C-QA compared to CA showed that the absorption of the metabolites of C-QA mainly takes place in the colon after C-QA is degraded by the microbiota whereas CA is to some extent already absorbed in the upper intestinal tract  .

Metabolite formation of chlorogenic acid C-QA for three independent in vitro fermentations with different donors A B and C. Each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of triplicates.increased within the first 7 h C. Between 7 h and 48 h a further slight increase in the formation of 3-HPPA was detected while the concentration of 34-DHPPA fell to a certain extent and remained es- sentially constant.As already presented for the fermentation of C-QA the concentra- tion of 3-PPA in the fermentations with C-IA was nearly constant data not shown.

For fermentation B the same metabolites at the same time points were also present in the fermentation of C-QA and C-IA but the concentration of 3-HPPA was already higher at 7 h in the C-QA fermentation than the concentration of 34-DHPPA.

With regard to amaranth it is of interest to determine whether or not the nutritive potential of amaranth arises from those exotic phenolic acid esters such as C-IA andor their biotransformation.The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro de- gradation of C-IA and C-QA with fecal microbiota from three different donors to investigate the biotransformation by the human gut micro- biota.

Metabolite formation of caffeoylisocitric acid C-IA for three independent in vitro fermentations with different donors A B and C. Each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of triplicates.the 'control samples II' data not shown.In vitro fermentation of caffeoylisocitric acidAs well as in the fermentations with C-QA the fecal microbiota from of all three donors was able to metabolize C-IA.

The in vitro fer- mentation of C-IA with the fecal slurry from donor C showed very si- milar behavior in metabolite formation as in the one of C-QA.The determination of 3-PPA in every fermentation and control samples at the same concentration level leads to the conclusion that 3- PPA is not a microbial product resulting from the degradation of C-QA or C-IA.

Due to the similar chemical structures of C-QA to C-IA it was assumed that C-IA has also a very low absorption rate in the small intestine and fermentation in the colon is much more relevant than absorption of the initial intact compound.

By comparing the degradation of C-QA with C-IA very similar metabolite formations and time courses were determined.With regard to the consumption of amaranth C-IA can be metabo- lized by the human gut microbiota.

The amount of C-IA was estimated from the LC-UV signal at 320 nm based on the assumption that C-IA has a similar molecular extinction due to the fact that CA is the only UV-active part of the molecule C-IA.

While free phenolic acids such as caffeic acid CA chemical structure see  are nearly completely absorbed in the small in- testine measurements of the recovery of C-QA in ileostomy effluents showed that only 30 of C-QA is taken up by passive diffusion  .
