tlr toll-like receptor.sustain immunosuppression to promote organ trans- plantation were thought to be applicable to pregnancy complications.the idea that constant immunosuppression is crucial for a successful pregnancy has been proven incorrect by several studies which demonstrate that the deletion of immune cells at the implantation site8-9 and the inhibition of key signalling pathways such as the pathway medi- ated by fas also known as tnfrsf6 and fas ligand fasl also known as tnfsf61011 are actually detri- mental to pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy loss10.

it should be noted that in addition to the maternal immune sys- tem the fetal-placental unit has an actively developing immune system that can further modify the maternal immune response and how the maternal immune sys- tem reacts to the environment.

2. taken together these findings support the requirement for immune infiltrates in the implantation site and fur- ther suggest that their presence is not associated with an anti-fetus immune response but instead is an active process that promotes tolerance to the fetus.these findings also suggest that whereas a suc- cessful organ transplant requires constant immuno- suppression a successful pregnancy requires a robust470  august 2017  volume 17dynamic and responsive immune system.

immune modulation and tolerance induction at the beginning of the pregnancy are required to allow implantation but a successful pregnancy also depends on a respon- sive immune system that can protect both the mother and the fetus against environmental insults when nec- essary.

the success of pregnancy thus highly depends on the ability of the immune system to maintain the status quo of each particular stage.the process of immune regulation during pregnancy is complex and involves epigenetic modifications53 micrornas54 autophagy and histocompatibility anti-lumen of the uterusendometrial epithelial celldeciduank cellgens55 unfortunately due to space limitations we do not discuss these aspects here.figure 5  the role of dendritic cells in blastocyst implantation.

the presence of these various immune cell types in the decidua early on in pregnancy has supported the theory which was first proposed by sir peter medawar7 that the implanting blastocyst is a semi-allograft and is capable of trigger- ing a maternal immune response that is devoted to its rejection.

thus the presence of immune infiltrates is required for a successful pregnancy and this suggests the possibility that immune cells are not recruited to the decidua as a response to a 'foreign' or 'non-self ' fetus but instead are actively recruited to facilitate proper implantation and promote a successful pregnancy.in support of this idea collins et al.14 demonstrated that decidual dc and t cell responses to the fetal 'allo- graft' are very distinct from the responses of dcs and t cells to organ transplantation.

although immune infiltrates arealready present after decidualization it has been shownthat this increased immune cell trafficking is crucial for a successful pregnancy.

as such the disruption of any of these chemokine signalling axes leads to reduced immune cell infiltration and has deleterious effects on pregnancy outcomes57.trophoblast cells also secrete cytokines that can act on immune cells after their recruitment fig.

the contribution of decidual cells to immune reg- ulation during pregnancy has recently been reviewed elsewhere406667.in addition to constitutively secreting chemokines and cytokines which can attract and educate immune cells trophoblast cells have been shown in numerous studies to have the ability to sense and respond to their microenvironment fig.

interestingly all of these effects were observed in the absence of a detectable virus infec- tion in the fetus151 suggesting that maternal immune activation is sufficient to induce these effects.using a different model of maternal immune acti- vation we found that the infection of pregnant mice with herpesvirus does not lead to preterm labour or any readily apparent pregnancy complication130.

furthermore it has been shown that exposure to the maternal microbiota during pregnancy can markedly affect the early development of the postnatal immune system in the offspring104-107.the maternal microbiota is also thought to contrib- ute to the tolerogenic anti-inflammatory stage that is observed during the second trimester of the pregnancy.

viral infections that are known to affect pregnancy and their clinical outcomes have recently been reviewed elsewhere124 and are summarized in table 1.conclusionan increasing number of studies support the con- cept that a modulated but dynamic and responsive immune system and definitely not a suppressive systemic one is required for a successful pregnancy.

it is thought that the presence of immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface represents an immune response that is directedagainst the semi-allogeneic fetus.
