These results suggested that DUOX could trigger ROS production to guard against pathogen invasion.AMPs expression involved in intestinal innate immunity against pathogenAMPs are essentially small molecular weight peptides with wideTable 1Bacterial taxonomic composition of the different samples at the class level.Taxonomy g-proteobacteria b-proteobacteria Fusobacteria Actinobacteria a-proteobacteria d-proteobacteria Sphingobacteriia Cytophagia Chlorobia BacteroidiaAbbreviations CNW Control group of Normal Water CAhW Control group of Water containing A. hydrophila CA Control group of Artemia CNI Control group of Normal zebrafish Intestine IAh Intestine of zebrafish immersed in water containing A. hydrophila.Fig.

However studies that involve challenging the composition of the intestinal microbiota and subsequent compar- isons with normal intestinal microbiota have rarely been reported in zebrafish.The host uses effective mechanisms to maintain microbiota homeostasis which is essential to maintaining good health.

Bacteria were filtered from the infection water Control group of Water containing A. hydrophila CAhW the control group water Control group of Normal Water CNW.

In this study we aimed to delineated the zebrafish intestinal microbiota composi- tion and found that a pathogen challenge influenced the abundance of intestinal microbiota and innate immunity.

It was shown that microbiota in control group of normal zebrafish intestine CNI and that in zebrafish intestine challenged by A. hydrophila IAh were distributed in different regions.
