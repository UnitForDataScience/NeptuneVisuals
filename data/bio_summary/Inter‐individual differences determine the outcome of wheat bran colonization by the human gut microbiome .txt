the microbial community derived from 10 subjects was used taking into account the large inter-individual variabil- ity in the human microbiome.resultsthe wheat bran residue harbours a specific wheat bran associated microbiomein the introduction it was hypothesized that wheat bran particles consisting of a unique combination of insoluble fermentable and non-fermentable fibres might represent an interesting niche for gut micro-organisms to colonize and might therefore harbour a specific microbial commu- nity.

bacteroides ovatus was present in all donors but was only enriched in the bran environment in donors 3 0.17-5.4 5 25-63.4 7 0.7-1.3 and8 1.5-10 although the abundances were also high inthe faecal samples of donor 1 4 and 10. these results indicate that i not all bacteroides species have the same potential to colonize the bran and that ii even within a bacterial species the capacity to colonize the bran can be variable.

large increases on the bran were seen in donor 1 0.8-35 donor 4 8-40 donor 7 1.3-10 and donor 8 0.9-4.otu 4 with the highest sequence similarity to clostridium xylanolyticum was more efficiently colonizing the bran compared with the luminal environment for all donors p 5 0.002 most notably for donor 1 0.1-21 donor2 1.9-17 donor 3 0.4-39 donor 5 0.02-17 donor 8 0.7-17 and donor 9 0.6-13. indonor 2 1.8-15 donor 6 4-21 and donor 7 2-20 otu 9 belonging to clostridium cluster xiva with sequence similarity to hungatella hathewayi formerly known as clostridium hathewayi was enriched on the bran.

the megamonas genus was represented by only one otu otu 15 most similar to megamonas funiformis in only one donor donor 8 but with a profound preference for colonizing the bran 6.1-32.2. cluster iv member faecalibacterium prausnitzii otu 7 was not well established on the bran 0.4-3 although present in all donors at high abundance ranging from 0.3 to 8 p 5 0.037.inter-individual differences in donor gut microbiota dictate the functional and community composition response toward inulin and wheat brana specific subset of the microbial community with the capacity to degrade wheat bran derived carbohydrates possibly by attaching to it may be stimulated thereby affecting the luminal microbiota.

this hypothesis was addressed by separately incubating wheat bran with the faecal inoculum derived from 10 different human donors for 48 h. the chemical composition of the wheat bran residue was analyzed and starch was efficiently removed reduced from 14.7 to 1.2 dw from the substrate upon in vitro digestion and subsequent fermentation by faecal bacteria.

the remaining bran particles mainly consisted of dietary fibre comprising cellulose 16.5 dw and arabinoxylans 31.6 dw with increasing degree of substitution ax ratio of 1.1 com- pared with before ax 0.6. the microbiota attached to the wheat bran residue after a washing procedure to remove loosely attached bacteria further termed bran-attached microbiota was compared with the microbial community in the liquid phase further termed luminal microbiota.
