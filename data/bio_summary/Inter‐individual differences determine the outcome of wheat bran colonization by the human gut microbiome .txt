The microbial community derived from 10 subjects was used taking into account the large inter-individual variabil- ity in the human microbiome.ResultsThe wheat bran residue harbours a specific wheat bran associated microbiomeIn the introduction it was hypothesized that wheat bran particles consisting of a unique combination of insoluble fermentable and non-fermentable fibres might represent an interesting niche for gut micro-organisms to colonize and might therefore harbour a specific microbial commu- nity.

This hypothesis was addressed by separately incubating wheat bran with the faecal inoculum derived from 10 different human donors for 48 h. The chemical composition of the wheat bran residue was analyzed and starch was efficiently removed reduced from 14.7 to 1.2 DW from the substrate upon in vitro digestion and subsequent fermentation by faecal bacteria.

At species level however these two bran samples collo- cated with the bran samples from the other donors Supporting Information Fig.

These results indicate that i not all Bacteroides species have the same potential to colonize the bran and that ii even within a bacterial species the capacity to colonize the bran can be variable.
