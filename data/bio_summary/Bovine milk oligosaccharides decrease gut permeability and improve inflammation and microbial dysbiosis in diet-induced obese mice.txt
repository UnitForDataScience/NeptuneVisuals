On the other hand at the gut level the WD diet had a profound effect on gut barrier function and gut microbiota as already described Cani et al.

QIIME allows analysis of high-throughput community sequencing data.

The gut microbiota and barrier function are highly responsive to gut environment Kashyap et al.

There was a significant increase in levels of tnf-a mRNA in WD versus C mice in the colonic mucosa addition of BMO to the WD normalized the levels of this inflammatory marker Figure 4G.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated that whey-extracted BMO ameliorates WD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier function in mice.

In particular BMO increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and reduced the overabundance of Allobaculum and Ruminococcus which had bloomed with the WD diet.The main effect on gut microbiota induced by addition of BMO to the WD diet in our model was the increased abundance of Lactobacillus from an average 6-10 to 30-39.Lactobacillus is not known to be the best bacteria to metabolize milk oligosaccharides as opposed to Bifidobacterium species which harbor distinctive gene clusters that are specifically induced during growth on HMO Barile and Rastall 2013.

Transfer of the gut microbiota from obese mice into lean germ-free mice recapitulates the obese phenotype Turnbaugh et al.

Moreover dietary components and timing of intervention alter gut microbiota differently Clarke et al.

Body weight A plasma leptin levels B fasted glycemia C and plasma LPS-binding protein LBP levels D were measured in mice fed a control chow C diet or Western diet WD for 7 wk or WD for 5 wk followed by WD supplemented with bovine milk oligosaccharides WDBMO for 2 wk.

Cecal ex vivo permeability to FITC-4000 FD-4 Sigma Aldrich St. Louis MO A and horseradish peroxidase HRP Sigma Aldrich B cecal conductance C colonic ex vivo permeability to FD-4 D and HRP E colonic conductance F and colonic tumor necrosis factor TNF-a mRNA levels G were evaluated in mice fed a control chow C diet or Western diet WD for 7 wk or WD for 5 wk followed by WD supplemented with bovine milk oligosaccharides WDBMO for 2 wk.
