it is crucial to understand the genetic and environ- mental factors of foxtail millet 2540 foxtail millet cultivars with the phenotypic traits and genomes were deposited in the china national gene bank-shenzhen 13-15.these collections facili- tate a deep understanding of how the genotypes and root micro- biota affect the foxtail millet growth development and yield.in this study we sequenced the rhizosphere and rhizoplane bacterial microbiota in 1219 foxtail millet cultivars which were grown in 2 far-separated fields in china yangling and zhangji- akou.

the roots of plants excrete 10-44 photo- synthetically fixed carbon which may serve as an energy source signaling molecules or antimicrobials for soil microorganisms  fitting the hypothesis that plants actively shape their root microbiome by root exudates and other rhizodeposits stimulat- ing andor inhibiting various microbes.8jin et al.taken together our work has systematically characterized the root bacterial microbiota of foxtail millet and identified po- tential beneficial root bacterial and genomic pathways which will provide a basis for the application of beneficial root bacteria for agricultural improvement.

our work provides a basis for potential agricultural improvement of foxtail millet by root microbiota modification.data descriptionthe root microbiota of foxtail millet remains largely unknown.

our results demonstrated that potentially beneficial bacteria tended to co-occur in the root zone of foxtail millet while non-beneficial bacteria did not form a close correlation.functional prediction and comparison between rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbiomewe predicted the functional profiling of the foxtail millet root microbiome with the picrust package .

host plants influence bacteria by root exudates with a variety of organic molecules in return root bacteria may benefit plant health and productivity in multiple ways such as producing important plant hormones or degrading harmful chemicals.discussionwe defined the taxonomic structure of the foxtail millet root microbiota mainly comprising acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria.

the previous studies also revealed that acidobacteria was widespread in different types of soils but was not present in the plant root   .root bacteria correlated to foxtail millet growth and productivitywe first evaluated the correlation between rhizoplane micro- biota and foxtail millet traits using the yangling dataset because of its large sample size.

it will help further our un- derstanding of this microecosystem in the root zone.potential implicationsin this work we characterized bacterial otus' composition in the root zone using more than 1000 foxtail millet cultivars from 2 well-separated geographic locations.

our result indicated that the foxtail millet was the major factor that drove the assembly of the root-associated microbiome.we analyzed the association between grain weight of foxtail millet and the corresponding rhizoplane bacterial microbiota using methods similar to those applied in human-associated studies  .

the b-diversity analysis revealed that microhabitat was the major factor shaping foxtail millet root bacterial community followed by geographic locations.

we systematically described the root bacterial community structure of foxtail millet and found its core rhizoplane bacterial members.

s1c and d.we evaluated the influence of geographical locations and microhabitat on foxtail millet root microbiota structure us- ing unifrac distance.

according to the 3-step enrichment model  our results demonstrated that the influence of the host to the rhizosphere microbiota was different in these 2 sampling sites which may be due to the correspond- ing soil characteristics.table 1 summary of samples and otus assigned to different taxonomic levels of otus assigned toyl yangling zjk zhangjiakou bs bulk soil rs rhizosphere rp rhizoplane.figure 1 dominant bacterial phyla detected in foxtail millet root compartments and bulk soils.
