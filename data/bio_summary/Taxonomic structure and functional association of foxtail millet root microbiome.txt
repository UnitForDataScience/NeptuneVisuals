It is crucial to understand the genetic and environ- mental factors of foxtail millet 2540 foxtail millet cultivars with the phenotypic traits and genomes were deposited in the China National Gene Bank-Shenzhen 13-15.These collections facili- tate a deep understanding of how the genotypes and root micro- biota affect the foxtail millet growth development and yield.In this study we sequenced the rhizosphere and rhizoplane bacterial microbiota in 1219 foxtail millet cultivars which were grown in 2 far-separated fields in China Yangling and Zhangji- akou.

The roots of plants excrete 10-44 photo- synthetically fixed carbon which may serve as an energy source signaling molecules or antimicrobials for soil microorganisms  fitting the hypothesis that plants actively shape their root microbiome by root exudates and other rhizodeposits stimulat- ing andor inhibiting various microbes.8Jin et al.Taken together our work has systematically characterized the root bacterial microbiota of foxtail millet and identified po- tential beneficial root bacterial and genomic pathways which will provide a basis for the application of beneficial root bacteria for agricultural improvement.

Our work provides a basis for potential agricultural improvement of foxtail millet by root microbiota modification.Data descriptionThe root microbiota of foxtail millet remains largely unknown.

Our results demonstrated that potentially beneficial bacteria tended to co-occur in the root zone of foxtail millet while non-beneficial bacteria did not form a close correlation.Functional prediction and comparison between rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbiomeWe predicted the functional profiling of the foxtail millet root microbiome with the PICRUSt package .

The previous studies also revealed that Acidobacteria was widespread in different types of soils but was not present in the plant root   .Root bacteria correlated to foxtail millet growth and productivityWe first evaluated the correlation between rhizoplane micro- biota and foxtail millet traits using the Yangling dataset because of its large sample size.

The Sorensen-Dice index is a statistic used for comparing the similarity of 2 samples only considering the presence or absence of taxa which could be calculatedC2s12 s1  s2where s1 is the number of OTU species in rhizoplane sample s2 is the number of OTU species in rhizosphere sample and s12 is the shared OTU species of each pair of rhizoplane and rhizosphere samples.The Morisita-Horn's index of overlap emphasizes differences in the most prevalent taxa between samples which could be cal- culatedprofiling in rhizoplane of foxtail millet against their grain weight using modified parameters ntree  1000 and nodesize  15 as was done previously by Subramanian et al.

Host plants influence bacteria by root exudates with a variety of organic molecules in return root bacteria may benefit plant health and productivity in multiple ways such as producing important plant hormones or degrading harmful chemicals.DiscussionWe defined the taxonomic structure of the foxtail millet root microbiota mainly comprising Acidobacteria Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.

It will help further our un- derstanding of this microecosystem in the root zone.Potential implicationsIn this work we characterized bacterial OTUs' composition in the root zone using more than 1000 foxtail millet cultivars from 2 well-separated geographic locations.

In both Yangling and Zhangji- akou 12 specific KO pathways were significantly enriched inFoxtail millet root microbiome5aFigure 4 Bacterial marker OTUs correlated with foxtail millet general health in Yangling.

Our result indicated that the foxtail millet was the major factor that drove the assembly of the root-associated microbiome.We analyzed the association between grain weight of foxtail millet and the corresponding rhizoplane bacterial microbiota using methods similar to those applied in human-associated studies  .
