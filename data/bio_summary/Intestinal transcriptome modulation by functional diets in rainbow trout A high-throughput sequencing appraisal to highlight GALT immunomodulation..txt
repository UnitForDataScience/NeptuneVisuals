The KEGG pathways in stressed fish were evaluated based on the transcripts with absolute fold change of 3 of CTRL group at high density in comparison to CTRL group at low density and is shown in black bars CTRL.Table 4Gene transcription levels for the seleted KEGG pathways related to immune response in intestines of rainbow trout kept at low and high density for 30 days and fed functional diets.fish have been systematically investigated since Bonga re- ported a thorough appraisal of how stress response is orchestrated and it is known that stressors jeopardize fish's health under culture .

Nevertheless under high stocking density amongst the most upregulated transcript there were perforin precursor 6 times more expressed than in PRO group FBPL4 and MHC class I alpha chain what indicates that PRE fish group also plays a role in immune stimulation in fish under deleterious conditions.ConclusionsFunctional diets based on S. cerevisiae MOS or the mix of both modulate intestinal transcriptome after 30 days but in a dynamic manner according to stocking density which is summarized in .

When fish were kept at high density exclusive transcripts increased from 4.8 to 9.3 in fish from PRO group and from 7.8 to 19.2 in MIX group whereas the PRE group decreased from 11.2 to 4.1.

While fish from PRE HD group present very few regulated path- ways fish from MIX HD group present a diverse set of pathways between them immune system and metabolism are up-regulated showing a pattern opposing the effect of density.Intestine immunomodulation by functional diets at low and high densityThe first screen of each diet exclusively DEGs from the selected immune related pathways according to KAAS annotation resulted in 204 transcripts 155 of which were down-regulated after 4 weeks of feeding fish with a probiotic supplemented diet PRO LD compared to CTRL LD and 153 were found down-regulated in CTRLTable 3Top 10 regulated transcripts in comparison to control in each group at high density.HD group when compared to CTRL LD comprising about 75 of the dataset in both groups.

When fish are held at high density but are fed with probiotics there is a shift on the pattern seen at low density and there are more transcripts being up-regulatedTable 2Top 10 regulated transcripts in comparison to control in each group at low density.participating in immune related pathways such as lysosome endocytosis TNF signaling T cell receptor signaling and others.

On the other hand several genes were found to be strongly down-regulated by high density but their expression in the fish from PRO HD group was reverse reflecting an active mitigatory action and in some cases nulling high density effects.

Proportion based statistical analysis was applied to each group in comparison to the control group of the respective density LD or HD and to select the dif- ferential expressed transcripts among diets Kal's statistical test was applied to TPM values of each transcriptome to evaluate the fold change.

However under high density the intestinal transcriptome from MIX group presented the higher transcriptomic regulation with 4650 transcripts with fold change  3 exclusively in this group.

Dashed line represents the average fold change of the im- mune related genes in the group fed normal diet and kept at low density CTRL LD and is represented by NORMAL for comparison purposes.study by the presence of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha HIF-1 alpha and MHC class II beta chain precursor among the most up- regulated transcripts in PRE group.

Fish fed functional diets presented better condition regardless density and that functional diets modulate intestinal transcriptome in different manner depending on the stocking density.
