in contrast other groups have demonstrated that the administration of prophylactic antibiot-ics ceftriaxone and metronidazole 48 h prior to oocyte retrieval for ivf-embryo transfer was associated with significantly increased im- plantation p  0.01 and clinical pregnancy rates p  0.01. in one such study women were subjected to mock embryo transfer prior to antibiotic administration and were classified into three groups based on the presence of bacterial colonization on the embryo transfer cath- eter tip at both mock and actual embryo transfer group 1 were negative for bacterial culture at both procedures group 2 tested posi- tive for bacterial presence on catheter tip at mock embryo transfer but following antibiotic administration tested negative and group 3 tested positive for bacteria on the embryo transfer catheter tip both at mock and actual embryo transfer .

egbase and colleagues first demonstrated this link in a study of 110 women un- dergoing ivf-embryo transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection icsi in which the endocervical swabs at time of embryo transfer and embryo transfer catheter tips were analysed for microbial colo- nization .

microbes may gain access to the amniotic cavity via several mecha- nisms - by ascending from the vagina and cervix haematogenous transfer through the placenta accidental inoculation and coloniza- tion through invasive procedures or via retrograde transfer from the fallopian tubes .

further correlations between bacterial transfer via embryo transfer catheter tip and pregnancy outcomes have been reported by .

in their prospective clinical trial in 91 women an increase in live-birth rate was associated with the recovery of h2o2- producing lactobacilli from the vagina p  0.01 and the embryo transfer catheter p  0.01 while a reduction in live-birth rate was associated with recovery of streptococcus viridans from the embryo transfer catheter tip p  0.04 .

in clinics great care is taken to reduce the risk of microbial transfer into the cervix during embryo transfer by cleaning the external os of the cervix with culture medium and by avoiding touching the vaginal walls and ex- ternal cervix with the catheter tip.

after consecutive single embryo transfer of euploid embryos the most distal 5 mm portion of the transfer catheter was placed in a dna-free tube under sterile conditions.

in addition while prophylactic antibiotics are commonly used as part of ivf-embryo transfer protocols to prevent infections after invasive pelvic procedures their effect on implantation in the setting of ivf-embryo transfer still remains to be determined.

several studies have supported the hypothesis that the reproductive tract microbiome on the day of embryo transfer affects pregnancy outcome.

this further emphasizes the importance of vaginal microbial profil- ing in the context of ivf-embryo transfer treatments as endometriosis is associated with infertility and this study provides evidence that treat- ment for endometriosis may affect the vmb.altering the vmbantibioticsif we accept the proposition that an altered vmb may have an influ- ence on fertility and assisted reproductive technology outcomes it is necessary to investigate possible therapeutic alternatives.

we will investigate the impact of vaginal microbiome composition on reproductive outcomes within the context of infertility treatments and the implications this has been shown to have on assisted reproductive technology procedures.c 2017 the authors.

indeed this transformation is shown by the exponential increase in the number of publications describing the influence of the composition and structure of the inhabiting microbial communities on reproductive health and fertility outcomes  .the objective of this review is to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the terminology used in this field which is some- times unknown to reproductive health and ivf specialists.

this review will also examine the impact of a dynamic adaptable microbiota on assisted reproductive technology procedures and reproductive out- comes and the impact of such procedures on the composition of the microbiota itself.the vmb of healthy womenthe vmb has been recognized as an important factor involved in the protection of the host from various bacterial fungal and viral patho- gens.

the authors concluded that the negative effect of non-lactobacillus- dominated endometrial microbiota should be considered as one of the causes of poor reproductive outcomes implantation failure and loss of pregnancy.by better understanding the vmb and its dynamics throughout pregnancy researchers hope to promote reproductive health and reduce the risk of infertility spontaneous abortion and preterm birth.

the vaginal microbiome in turn may be altered by exogenous factors that may lead to improved pregnancy outcomes however much research is still needed to elucidate the balance of bacterial species that result in optimal reproductive health outcomes for each woman.a r t i c l ei n f o article historyreceived 28 september 2016 received in revised form 5 april 2017 accepted 6 april 2017declaration the authors report no financial or commercial conflicts of interest.keywordsassisted reproductive technology dysbiosisivfpregnancy outcome probioticsvaginal microbiomer e f e r e n c e s we learned after a decade of molecular characterization plos one
