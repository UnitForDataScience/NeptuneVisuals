furthermore studying the effects of diarrhea per se on the gut microbiota is relevant for our understanding of infectious diarrheal disease which remains a major cause of mortality worldwide .several previous studies have investigated the effects of induced diarrhea on the human gut microbiota using 16s rrna gene surveys that provide a more complete representation of the community than the older culture-based techniques .

we designed our sampling regime both to compare the effect of iiod to the routine temporal variability of the gut microbiota in the same subject and to assess the timecourse of community recovery after iiod.some recent studies of the human gut microbiota have continued to rely on 16s rrna gene surveys alone   but it is increasingly common to combine such surveys with additional high throughput culture independent methods such as metagenomic 'shotgun' sequencing   or metabolomics  .

specifically we pursued the fol- lowing study aims 1 determine whether and how quickly the gut microbiota demonstrates resilience after an iiod perturbation 2 elucidate patterns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process across individuals and 3 innovate and apply statistical methods for high-dimensional longitudinal multidomain data that pro- vide greater interpretability than existing methods.materials and methodsethics statementthe research was approved by an administrative panel for the protection of human subjects institutional review board of stanford university protocol 25268. all subjects were prop- erly informed of the risks and benefits of this study and then signed an approved written con- sent form.experimental designan unequally spaced time point design for longitudinal data with perturbations was created according to recommendations in the statistical design literature  .demographic and life history factors such as gender race and bmi often used to stratify human populations in epidemiological studies generally have only small effects on the gut microbiota .

specifically we pursued the following study aims 1 determine whether and how quickly the gut microbiota demonstrates resilience after iiod perturbation 2 elucidate pat- terns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process and 3 develop statistical methods for the examination of multidomain data that provide greater biological interpretability than existing methods.immediate response to iiod is a transient community shift followed by recovery of pre-perturbation statethe present study constitutes an investigation of unprecedented rigor--with regard to length of sampling time period temporal resolution of sampling and generation of multiple data types--of the effects on the gut microbial community of a disturbance type intestinal cleanout relevant to clinical practice and ecological theory.as controls for comparison to the perturbed samples of each subject we used unperturbed samples of the same subject rather than making a comparison between distinct groups of sub- jects which did or did not experience iiod.

species capable of growth on the host- derived resources that would be available during and immediately after cleanout could begin to repopulate the colon earlier than specialist species that rely on specific diet components.prominent gut firmicutes tend to be nutritional specialists whereas gut bacteroidetes and members of the bacteroides genus in particular are versatile foragers capable of growth on host-derived mucin  .a related but distinct potential explanatory mechanism for the compositional changes seen immediately post-cleanout is variation in intrinsic growth rates.

in the unperturbed gut reduced resource competition means that microorganism growth need only keep pace with the flow rate of the gut so rapid growth is not as important for specialist fitness.

the provisioning of these and many other compounds are recognized as ecosystem services of the gut microbiota with health effects both locally in the gut and sys- temically throughout the host  .the new tools and insight described in this work provide guidance and a framework for a more comprehensive assessments of stability and resilience in complex ecosystems such as the human microbiome.

this experiment has enabled a careful multidomain analysis of a controlled perturbation of the human gut micro- biota with a new level of resolution.

this form of regularization is used in both our tree-regularized supervised lda and unsupervised sparse canonical correlation analysis scca.by implementing an intensive longitudinal sampling scheme that extended well before and after iiod we sought to place this perturbation to the human gut microbiota in the context of routine temporal variability.

the published literature may be biased by the relatively recent recognition of widespread microaerophily a systematic investigation into the respiratory reductases encoded by 254 complete and partial genomes of human gut microbes found evidence for microaerophily in all 43 bacteroides genomes that were examined but only 4 of 9 genomes from ruminococcus .perturbation-associated go functional terms include both directly- relevant and genomically-linked termsin addition to the 16s rrna analyses employed by previous studies of iiod we collected metagenomic data and integrated analysis of the two data types using multitable methods.
