TLR4 knock out mice and mice that had gut decontamination showed significant decrease in tyrosine nitration and inflammatory mediators IL1b andMCP-1 in both the small intestine and frontal cortex.

Microbiome analysis was done by Sec- ond Genome the microbiome company San Francisco CA.AnimalsAdult wild type male C57BL6J mice and adult mice that contained the disrupted TLR4 gene TLR4 KOB6.B10ScN-Tlr4lpsdelJthJ were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor ME.

The treated mice group GW-T and TLR4 KO GW-TLR4 KO mice group were dosed tri-weekly for one week with PB 2mgkg and Permethrin.200 mgkg via oral route.

The control group GW-Con of mice was received saline injections and vehicle for oral gavage in the same paradigm.Lipopolysaccharides LPS exposureIn order to generate TLR4 activated positive control wild type male C57BL6J mice were exposed to LPS as published earlier.

Briefly mice received single bolus infusion of LPS 12 mgkg and mice were euthanized after 24 h for tissue and serum.

Results showed that there was a significant increase almost 2.0 fold in sys- temic endotoxin levels in GW-T group as compared to GW-Con mice P0.05 while decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract with antibiotics in mice treated with antibioticsDifferentially abundant features in GW-T vs. GW-Con Each point represents an OTU belonging to each Genus.

This research that uses an established GWI rodent model antibiotic treatment regimen to nullify the effect of gut bacteria and transgenic TLR4 knockout mice show a distinct role of the altered gut microbiome in causing inflammatory intestinal injury and neuronal inflammation.Materials and methodsMaterialsNeomycin trisulfate salt Neomycin Enrofloxacin Pyridostigmine bromide PB Permithrin lipopolysaccharides LPS and Corticosterone were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich St. Louis MO.

All mice were sacrificed after animal experiments had been completed.

Right after anesthesia blood from the mice was drawn using cardiac puncture in order to preserve serum for the experiments.

The mice brain was removed immediately after terminal surgery.
