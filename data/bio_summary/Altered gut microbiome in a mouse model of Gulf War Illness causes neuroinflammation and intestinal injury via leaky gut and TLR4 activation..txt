the results suggested that the altered gut micro- biome and the leaky gut caused increased oxidative stress through a tlr4 dependent pathway.tlr4 activation following gulf war chemical exposure-induced gut microbial changes cause neuronal and intestinal inflammationgulf war chemical exposure and rodent models of gulf war illness have shown increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain  .

current address department of medicine gastroenterology university of massachusetts medical school worcester massachusetts united states of americaabstractmany of the symptoms of gulf war illness gwi that include neurological abnormalities neuroinflammation chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbances have been traced to gulf war chemical exposure.

the present study also throws light on possible microbiome- brain axis or vice versa for disease development in war veterans.the present study showed a direct relationship of gulf war chemical exposure and altered gut microbiota diversity with changes in the phylum and family levels.

2017 altered gut microbiome in a mouse model of gulf war illness causes neuroinflammation and intestinal injury via leaky gut and tlr4 activation.

using an established rodent model of gulf war illness we show that chemical exposure caused significant dysbiosis in the gut that included increased abundance of phy- lum firmicutes and tenericutes and decreased abundance of bacteroidetes.

these events signified that gut dysbio- sis with simultaneous leaky gut and systemic endotoxemia-induced tlr4 activation contrib- utes to gw chemical-induced neuroinflammation and gastrointestinal disturbances.decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.competing interests the inclusion of researchers from second genome inc. cnr and lsc does not alter our adherence to plos one policies on sharing data and materials  .introductionprior research shows that shortly after the first persian gulf war gw a series of unique symptoms plagued many of the deployed veterans  .

many of these symptoms are difficult to categorize as they have no known cause no objective findings on clinical examina- tion no diagnostic biomarkers no known tissue pathology and no curative therapy.well-conducted clinical studies and nationwide federal surveys provide documented evi- dence that exposure to gw agents such as pesticides and insect repellents along with the con- sumption of nerve agent pre-treatment sets containing pyridostigmine bromide pb are among the major causative factors implicated in the etiopathogenesis of gulf war illness gwi  -.

with evidence of the exposure of these chemicals in the war theater through oral nasal and dermal routes it is reasonable to predict that the above-listed exposures either in unison or individually can cause severe organ-spe- cific or systemic oxidative stress and inflammation effects that may depend on the route of exposure.chemical exposures through an oral or systemic route have been shown to cause significant inflammation and intestinal oxidative stress-.

with sufficient evidence from gw veteran studies about the existence of chronic fatigue and gi disturbances coupled with neuro- nal inflammation it is all the more important that we explore newer and novel mechanistic pathways especially the role of the gut microbiome in modulating adverse outcomes in gwi such as neuroinflammation and intestinal injury.the present study examines the effect of exposure of gulf war chemicals pb and permethrin and their resultant alteration of the gut microbiome as a key pathway to neuroinflammation and gi disturbances via systemic endotoxemia and toll like receptor pathway activation.

we used standard procedures for evaluating immunohis- tochemistry and relative mrna expression data as described in our previous publications.resultsgulf war chemical exposure and chronic corticosterone administration causes gut dysbiosischemical exposures and chronic drug use cause significant oxidative stress in the liver intes- tine and the kidneys signifying that the drugs and their intermediates might also have a cyto- toxic effect on the normal gut microbial flora -.
