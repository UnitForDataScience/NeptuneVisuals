In ad- dition essential sporulation genes such as ssgA 53 were highly expressed in S. tropica and S. pacifica but silent in both S. arenicola strains providing further support that these latter two strains were not sporulating and that the PKS4A component of the BGC is critical for spore pigment biosynthesis.The fourth example of differential expression was observed in the sta BGC and provides a different paradigm in which it was not possible to infer meaningful correlations between BGC gene content and expression patterns.

Of the 23 shared BGCs identified in the four Salinispora strains 13 were expressed in at least one of the strains and five of these 38 were differentially expressed among strains Fig.

While it remains unknown if malT is associated with the lack of expres- sion in CNT-150 these results illustrate the challenges associ- ated with predicting which BGCs will be expressed under a given set of growth conditions.The final example of a shared but differentially expressed BGC is NRPS4 which was expressed in S. arenicola andS.

While this BGC was expressed in all four strains different portions of the BGC were expressed in different strains Fig.

While these interpretations remain speculative BGC inactivation has been reported in fungi 69 and warrants further consideration in the strains studied here.While many orphan BGCs were expressed the observationthat some are differentially expressed among strains helps ex- plain the historical importance of strain selection.

A comparison of the BGCs associ- ated with these two expression patterns revealed that the fully expressed BGCs maintain either one S. pacifica or two S. trop- ica luxR homologs while the partially expressed versions maintain only small genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknownB DFig.

While the gene content and organization of the sta BGC is largely the same in all three strains the sequence identity of the malT regulatory gene shared 99 amino acid identity between the two S. arenicola strains yet only 82 with S. pacifica strain CNT-150 Fig.

CNB-440 S. tropica CNT-150 S. pacifica CNS-991 S. arenicola CNS-205 S. arenicola.

Here we show that bio- synthetic potential is more complicated than the simple presence or absence of a BGC as more than one-third 38 of the BGCs expressed in at least one strain were differentially expressed between strains.

However in both S. arenicola strains CNS-205 and CNS-991 only the left half of the BGC PKS4A was expressed while the right half PKS4B was silent.
