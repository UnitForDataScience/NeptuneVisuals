Concerning smooth-surface enamel caries there was no difference in the preventive effects of the experimental varnish versus the GS.Further studies are now needed to establish an efficacious protocol to sustain long-term antimicrobial activity of the propolis varnish particularly to prevent advanced dentinal carious lesions under a high cariogenic challenge.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development CNPq for the scholarship and wish to thank Andre Augusto Gomes Faraco and Jucara Ribeiro Franca for manufacturing the propolis varnish and Eliane Franco and Jose Carlos for their technical support as well as Bruna Benso Carina Denny Laila Facin Livia Galvao Camila Batista Luiz Eduardo Ferreira and Cleiton P.

The carbohydrate fermentation process createslow-pHmicroenvironments that favor enamel and dentin demineralization.6Natural products are major sources of bioactive moleculesandpharmaceuticalleads andhavetherefore contributed significantly todrugdevelopment.7Among these propolis is one such product that stands out for its biological properties mainly as an antimicrobial with direct application in dentistry.89 Its anti-caries mechanism of action is associated with inhibition of glucosyltransferases and downregulation of specific genes associated with stress survival and tolerance in S. mutans.10 Moreover some flavonoids terpenoids isoflavones and other phenolic acids contained in propolis were found to diminish S. mutans acid production and tolerance.101112Overall a large number of biological activities have been attributed to different types of propolis including antimicrobial antifungal antitumor and others.9 Propolis type 12 from southeastern Brazil13 demonstrated strong antibacterial effects and prevented caries development in rats.14 In addition topical application of the ethanolic extract of other types of propolis was also found to effectively reduce the incidence andseverity of carious lesions in vivo.141516 However the biological effects of propolis may vary according to the geographical origin and chemical composition of the collected sample.16Varnishes are materials widely used in dentistry for the prevention of dental caries.17 Some active principles can be incorporated into these formulations to promote and prolong their anti-caries effects including fluoride with remineralizing action18 and chlorhexidine with antimicrobial action.19An experimental propolis-containing varnish was developed by our research group as reported elsewhere.20 Our previous findings demonstrated that the experimental varnish has in vitro antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and showed a very satisfactory sustained release of propolis in vitro.20 These data have encouraged us to investigate the anti-caries activity of this experimental formulation using an animal model under a high cariogenicchallenge.

This suggests that application of propolis varnish in intimate contact with the oral tissues is not potentially harmful to host cells.Chitosan is a biocompatible and biodegradable poly meric material 3 3 with non- tox ic a nd antimicrobial properties.34 Chitosan of medium molecular weight was used as a vehicle during preparation of the experimental varnish.
