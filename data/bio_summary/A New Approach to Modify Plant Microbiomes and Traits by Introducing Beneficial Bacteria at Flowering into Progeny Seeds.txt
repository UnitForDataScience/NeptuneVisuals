Flavobacteria constituted less than 0.4 in control seeds but were enriched to 6 in PsJN- seeds and the a-Proteobacteria share was reduced from 67 of the bacteria in control seeds to 39 in PsJN-colonized seeds .DISCUSSIONOur data show that plant beneficial bacteria can be selectively introduced into plant seeds and replicated to a relatively high cell number and so provided to the next generation of plants.

Passage of strain PsJN from colonized seeds to the next generation of seeds was tested for pepper soy and wheat but PsJN was not found in any of the seeds.Changes in the Seed MicrobiomeFor a comprehensive assessment of the effects of incorporating selected bacteria into wheat seed on the bacterial seed microbiome we performed a culture-independent community analysis of single seeds by Illumina 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing.

Similar results were obtained with FISH microscopy of pepper seeds and PsJN was detected within the embryo together with other bacteria that were also detected on the seed coat  .Field ApplicationThe next step in our study was to test whether we can introduce bacteria and thereby modulate the seed microbiome during seed production in the field.

The internal seed microbiome is inherited from the previous generation via the seed and so presumably consists of microbes that can survive desiccation and the conditions of seed storage  .

The appearance of the first spike on each plant was documented through day 73.Field testing of spring wheat seeds the performance of seeds internally colonized by strain PsJN under field conditions was tested with T. aestivum L. cultivar Trappe.

The NONEUB probe negative probe not targeting bacterial sequences was used to validate FISH on these samples and to exclude false positives  only few natural greenblue-cyan- autofluorescent microbes could be seen inside the embryo of seeds colonized by PsJN and in control seeds .

After 12 months of storage of PsJN-colonized seeds we still recovered about 100 viable cells per g maize seeds illustrating the stability of the bacterium in seeds.Bacterial Cells Are Located in the Seed EmbryoWe next evaluated whether the application of PsJN to flowers of dicotyledonous plants would result in colonization of their seed microbiomes and performed greenhouse experiments with soy G. max L. cvs.

At seed maturity we found strain PsJN to be effectively introduced into the seeds - 21 out of 24 seeds tested positive in PsJN-specific qPCR assays.

The number of PsJN bacteria detected in soy seeds tested by strain-specific qPCR ranged from about 360 to about 4500 genome equivalents per seed.

The seed bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria which made up 92 and 90 of the OTUs in the control seeds and PsJN-seeds respectively.
