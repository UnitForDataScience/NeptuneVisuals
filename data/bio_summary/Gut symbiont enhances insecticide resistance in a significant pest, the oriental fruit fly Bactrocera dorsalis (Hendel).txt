Then cohorts of 15 RS flies each were fed with a trichlorphon solution and the number of dead flies was counted after 24 h. The trichlor- phon concentrations were 0 mgL 25 x 10-3 mgL50 x 10-3 mgL 100 x 10-3 mgL and 200 x 10-3 mgL.As control newly emerged RS flies were fed pure water and after 3 days provided trichlorphon in cohorts of 15 flies each.

We determined that CF-BD isolated from fruit flies was able to degrade trichlorphon and enhance the resistance of the flies to trichlorphon.

Moreover the RS flies that were fed the streptomycin solution were more sensitive to trichlorphon than the RS flies two-way ANOVA F  66.905 df  1 p  0.0001 LC50 89.78 mgL for RS streptomycin LC50  133.31 mgL for RS Fig.

As control newly emerged SS flies were fed pure water and after 3 days provided trichlorphon solu- tions in cohorts of 15 flies each.

For each trichlorphon concentration three replicates were performed.Resistance of flies cleared of CF-BDMore than 300 newly emerged RS flies were fed a streptomycin solution for 2 days to clear them of bacteria.

The diameters of colonies were measured after 24 h.Resistance of flies inoculated with CF-BDThe bacterial inoculum for flies was prepared by select- ing and incubating a colony of CF-BD in BHI medium at 30 degC until an OD600 of 0.8.

According to CLSI standards the cultures were classified as sensitive S medium I or resistant R. Plates containing 1 x 10-3 mgL trichlorphon were also prepared to test the sensitivity of the bacteria to trichlorphon with a 10-mL inoculum and an incubation period of 24 h. As a control plates without trichlorphon were prepared and incubated with inocula.

The functional proteins involved in the re- sistance response to trichlorphon were identified based on proteomic analyses of B. dorsalis treated with trichlorphon .

indicating that CF-BD was required for enhanced resistance to trichlorphon.The insecticide resistance of SS flies is increased after CF-BD supplementationWe also attempted to increase the abundance of CF-BD in the guts of SS flies by feeding them with CF-BD in- oculum.

After feeding SS flies CF-BD the amount of gut CF-BD was significantly higher than in the control flies that were given water independent-sample t test t  7.67 df  8 p  0.01 Fig.
