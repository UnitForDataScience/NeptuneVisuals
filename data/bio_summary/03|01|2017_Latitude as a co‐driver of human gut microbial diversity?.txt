Recent years have thus seen anexplosion of gut microbiome studies in so-called traditional rural non-industrialized societies children from Burkina Faso 8 people from Malawi and Venezuela 9 children from Bangladesh 10 hunter- gatherers from Tanzania 11 12 herders from Mongolia13 hunter-gatherers and farmers from Peru 14 Amerindians from Venezuela 15 adults from PapuaThe gut microbial diversity is reduced in industrialized countriesThe human gut microbiota i.e.

Given this correlation between species richness and latitude we ask whether the human gut microbiome diversity could also be influenced by such a climatic variable.However because the human gut microbiome is not directly exposed to external abiotic factors and tempera- ture humidity light exposure and oxygen concentration are similar between the gut of northern and southern individuals the influence of latitude on this ecosystem is not necessarily obvious.

For example our study in south-west Cameroon revealed that the gut microbial diversity is significantly increased when individu- als carry a non-pathogenic intestinal protozoa Entamoeaba 17 a result also observed in a different context for another intestinal protozoa Blasto- cystis 48 allowing to highlight the specific role of gut eukaryotes in increas- ing the gut microbial diversity.In order to further identify the ecological mechanisms underlying the difference in diversity between non- industrialized and industrialized popu- lations multiple approaches can be undertaken.

In- deed there would be limited differences in the amount of dietary fiber between rural and urban populations from such areas iv the sampling of environmental andor other human-associated micro- biomes in addition to the gut microbiome will help distinguishing patterns that are specific to the gut versus general ones that are more likely to be associated with broad ecological features.Finally what could be even more resourceful is the emergence of a consortium of researchers working on traditional gut microbiomes sharing common practices with the aim to compare studies to one another and merge datasets that are individually hard to collect.

It is thus possible that the diversity of environ- mental bacteria is correlated to that of gut bacteria.Latitude as a co-driver of the human gut microbial diversityIn order to test whether in humans part of the observed difference in diversity between industrialized andnon-industrialized countries could be attributed to a confounding effect of latitude we reanalyzed data from Nakayama et al.

Insights  PerspectivesLatitude as a co-driver of human gut microbial diversityEmma Dikongue and Laure SegurelThe human gut microbial diversity has been reported to be lower in industrialized populations as compared to non-industrialized ones.

To put into perspective the variation of the gut microbiome observed across the disproportionally studied individuals from Europe or the United States there has thus been an increased interest in characterizing the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in geographically diverse populations.

Indeed different predic- tions can be made depending on whether the decrease in diversity is observed solely for the gut or also for other microbiomes.Interestingly Clemente et al.
