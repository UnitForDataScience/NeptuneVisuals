OPENReceived 15 November 2016Accepted 26 April 2017 Published xx xx xxxxDiet-induced reconstruction of mucosal microbiota associated with alterations of epithelium lectin expression and regulation in themaintenance of rumen homeostasisHong Shen12 Zhongyan Lu3 Zhihui Xu12  Zanming Shen3It is unknown whether lectins of the rumen epithelium contribute to the recognition of mucosal microbes and activation of tolerogenic cytokines in ruminant animals.

These findings provide new insights into the interactions between the rumen epithelium and mucosal microbiota in the maintenance of rumen homeostasis.The mucosal microbiota is a group of gastrointestinal GI microbiota that inhabits the mucus layer of the GI tract.

Such alterations in the compositions of the mucosal microbiota induced upregulated expression of five membrane-bound lectins on the rumen epithelium.

This study expands our fundamental knowledge concerning the roles of evolutionarily conserved lectins in the maintenance of rumen homeostasis and provides new insight into the interactions between the mucosal microbiota and rumen epithelium.Table 2.

However its expression was not synchro- nized with the expansion of the mucosal microbiota suggesting a loose relationship between galectin-7 and the activities of the microbes.To date most C-type lectins CLRs and all known sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins siglecs have been shown to be membrane-bound proteins that are found on the cell surface and that contain one or more carbohydrate-recognition domains CRDs that are responsible for glycan binding.

Previous studies have shown that the dietary concentrate facilitates rumen fermentation and consequently affects the structure of the mucosal microbiota in the rumen.

Mao et al.reported that a 65 dietary concentrate diet decreased the diversity of the mucosal microbiota in the goat rumen compared with a 0 concentrate diet.

However Wetzels et al.observed a positive relationship between dietary energy substrates and the diversity and richness of the mucosal microbiota in the goat rumen by using 0 30 and 60 concentrate diets.

Besides the decrease of 9 microbial clades in the mucus layer was indicated to be correlated to upregulated expression of these functional lectins in the rumen epithelium.

In the present study an LC diet promoted diversification and expansion of the mucosal microbiota indicating that the amount of energy substrates in the rumen fluid also has an impact on the composition of the mucosal micro- biota.
