additional studies measuring changes in the bioactive factors in human milk of mothers with sick infants or who are sick them- selves for various specific infections should provide more insight into the essential bioactive factors in human milk for protection against specific infections.the human milk stem cells hmscs likely play an important role in the regeneration of the breast in preparation for lactation and theoretically in the infant's tolerance of maternal cell antigensas these cells from human milk do establish a microchimeric state in the infant.

although research into the spe- cific factors in human breast milk which lead to the remarkable health benefits of exclusive breastfeeding has been ongoing for decades there are still intriguing mysteries of how human milk contributes to the development and regulation of both the infant's innate  and adaptive immune function -.elucidating the relationship between the innate immune sys- tem and human milk as well as their individual and interactive transition over time remains challenging.

nevertheless it will be essential to understand the specific roles of the various bioactive components of human milk and how the change in milk composition over time influences the evolving effects of human milk on the intestine and innate immunity.differences in preterm and term human milkpreterm babies require additional nutrition and immune protec- tion compared to term infants.

8584. doi human milk is a dynamic source of nutrients and bioactive factors unique in providing for the human infant's optimal growth and development.

human milk microbiome directly shapes the infant's intestinal microbiome while the human milk oligosaccharides drive the growth of these microbes within the gut.

each of these new findings opens the door to future studies of human milk and its effect on the innate immune system and the developing infant.keywords human milk breast milk innate immunity colostrum pretermintroductionthe innate immune system is the first line of defense against infection and is activated within minutes reacting in a nonspecific preprogrammed and patterned manner to various infectious or foreign non-self stimuli .

there is a large body of evi- dence documenting the benefits of human breast milk for human infants in diminishing morbidity and mortality and protecting against specific infections during the period of breastfeeding -.

the multifunctionality of individual human milk factors adds another layer of complexity to the innate protection effected within the intestinal mucus layers.human milk oligosaccharides hmos are the predominant glycans and important nutrients in human milk.

the human milk glycoproteins hmgps vary in size structure and amount in human milk and can be classified based on their location relative to the cell secreted or attached to the cell membrane and the different mucus layers.

beyond that the hmscs in human milk may provide a ready source of patient-specific stem cells with a true multilineage potential for the study of such stem cells and variables related to breast cancer tissue regeneration and even bioengineering.microbiotain the past human milk was considered sterile but that is far from the truth.

how that symbiotic interaction influences the infant's health in the future as it relates to immune protection and immune reactivity allergy or autoimmune disease will require careful research involving not only genomics metabolomics proteomics and glycomics but also epigenetics and techniques still need to be developed.innate mechanisms of pathogenrecognitionthere are specific tlrs present in human milk including tlr2 tlr3 tlr5 as well as soluble cd14 scd14 and human b-defensin-1 hbd-1 which function as pattern recognition receptors prrs and amps .

other proteins lysozyme lf and peptide derivatives of it--lactoferricin and lactoferrampin a-lactalbumin transferring and osteopontin opn within human milk are recognized as important amps functioning via various mechanisms some of which enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of human milk   .

they postulated that the effect was due to effects on the intestinal integrity and repair as an example of an anti-inflammatory effect.evolution of bioactive factors in human milk over lactationthe composition of human milk is dynamic with significant change from colostrum transitional to mature milk between preterm and term milk and with interindividual and intraindi- vidual variation.

more recent published studies using proteomic analysis of human milk    continue to facilitate our understanding of the complex nature of human milk and its role related to immune function and intestinal development.
