As we better characterize this rela- tionship and transition from our singular focus of pathology to physiology our approach to manipulation of the endome- trial microbiome in an effort to improve reproductive out- comes will evolve and improve.REFERENCES.fi..... fl.fifl......fi.Diaz ..uEUR ....nan ..........fi.fififi .........fi....o .. ..........fl.........fi.......flfl .........oflfl ........

Of note the upper genital tract microbiome is quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of the lower genital tract however the qPCR data targeted only a limited number of bacteria .A study using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has compared the vaginal and endometrial micro- biota of asymptomatic and fertile nonpregnant women .

In approximately one fifth of the women analyzed the bacteria community identified in the endometrium varied greatly from that in the vagina suggest- ing that the endometrial and vaginal microbiota are not identical .ENDOMETRIAL MICROBIOTA IN HEALTH AND DISEASEPhysiological Endometrial Microbiome in Reproductive-Age WomenSeveral studies have now reported that the endometrium pos- sesses a functional microbiome in physiological conditions .

With advances in the detection of bacteria through cultivation-independent tech- niques that enable the characterization of low biomass micro- biota the endometrial microbiome has been studied more carefully.Like the normal vaginal microbiota the endometrium of healthy and asymptomatic women is often dominated by Lac- tobacilli .

There was enrichment of several taxa such as Anaerostipes Dialister Peptoniphilus Ruminococcus Anaerotruncus Atopobium Bacteroides and Porphyromonas in the reproductive tract of patients with endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared with those with benign conditions suggesting an infectious inflammatory role of bacteria in the onset on endometrial cancer .IMPACT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT MICROBIOME ON FERTILITYThe Microbiome in ReproductionWe have discussed the importance of the role of the micro- biome in the physiology and pathophysiology of human health and disease.

To investigate the contribution of the microbiome to gynecological cancers vaginal cervical fallopian ovarian peritoneal and urine samples from 31 women undergoing hysteroscopy for endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia or other benign conditions were subjected to sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene .

In fact commensal colonization of the fetus by commensal bacteria may be involved in the inductionof endotoxin tolerance for future exposure to bacteria the prevention of subsequent pathogen access to the host cells and the preparation of the neonatal gut for nutrition .Preterm BirthPreterm birth PTB constitutes the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns worldwide .

A possible explanation for this observation is that antibiotics can produce a deleterious effect not only on pathogenic bacteria but also on beneficial bacteria of the reproductive tract.ChorioamnionitisChorioamnionitis is an obstetrical complication caused by the inflammation of the fetal membranes produced by bacterial infection.

The fact that these biofilms exist from the vagina to the fallopian tubes allows complex and dynamic interactionsbetween the gametes and embryo as well as the maternal tissue interface .Characterization of the Microbiome in the Reproductive TractHistorically the uterus was assumed to be free of bacteria and most of the data on the reproductive tract are based on vaginal samples.

More than 70 of women demonstrated vaginal microbiota dominated by L. crispatus L. gasseri L. iners or L. jensenii corresponding to CST-I -II -III and -V. A smaller proportion of women exhibit CST-IV characterized by lower percentage of Lactobacilli and dominance of anaerobic bacteria including Aerococcus Atopobium Dialister Gardnerella Megasphaera Prevotella and Sneathia .Data on the normal upper genital tract microbiome are not as prevalent .
