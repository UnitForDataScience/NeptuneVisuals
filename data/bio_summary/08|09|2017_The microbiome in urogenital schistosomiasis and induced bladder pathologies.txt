It is also possible the pathology cases with no infection determined by urine microscopy only could be due to a chronic uro- genital schistosomiasis infection in which egg shedding reduces progressively with occurrence of pathologies.To summarize while the current study substantially reports differences in the urinary tract microbiome between persons infected with urogenital schistosomiasis and healthy persons and between persons having bladder pathologies due to urogenital schistosomiasis and per- sons with urogenital schistosomiasis infection alone there are a few possible limitations.

There was a non-significant reduction in diversity in female samples.Using only control samples unclassified Enterobacteriaceae and unclassified Pseudomonada- ceae were significantly abundant in females p  0.035 p  0.021 respectively.Several taxa distinguish urogenital schistosomiasis infected cases from non-infected cases as well as advanced cases from infection aloneThere was a significant difference in the microbial community between infected and non- infected at all levels tested genus level p  6.55E-10 and OTU levels p  2.06E-16 .

The occurrence and different forms of bladder tumors and bladder pathologies have been associated with urogenital schistosomiasis in Nigeriaand in other parts of Africa .Research on molecular pathology influencing the outcomes of bladder infection by Schisto- soma haematobium is urgently needed to develop new diagnostics therapeutics and infection prevention strategies.Earlier studies have suggested that the mechanism of formation of bladder tumours will be due to formation of nitrosamines polyaromatic hydrocarbons free radicals and presence of microbes .

The objectives of the study were to 1 determine the microbiome changes in urine samples during urogenital schistosomiasis and induced pathologies and 2 identify functional biological processes that could be altered by such changes.MethodsOverview of methodsThe approach of the research study consisted of recruiting study participants screening for schistosomiasis infection and bladder pathologies microbiome sequencing pre-processing of microbiome sequences and data analytics of microbiome sequence data collection.Ethics and study participantsStudy participants were adults recruited from Eggua in Ogun State southwestern Nigeria 0701.592 N 002 55.083 E in a cross-sectional study.

We identified four major groups of participants based on the status of infection and bladder pathology  comprising a the Advanced group having infection and bladder pathol- ogies b Bladder pathology-only group c infection-only detected by microscopy or PCR and d controls no infection or pathology.

The objective of the research study was to determine the microbiome features and changes in urine during urogenital schistoso- miasis and induced bladder pathologies.MethodologySeventy participants from Eggua southwestern Nigeria provided morning urine samples and were screened for urogenital schistosomiasis infection and bladder pathologies in a cross-sectional study.

We found a non-significant reduction in mean diversity in infected cases compared to non-infected in pathology cases compared to no- pathology cases and in advanced cases compared to others p  0.1 .
