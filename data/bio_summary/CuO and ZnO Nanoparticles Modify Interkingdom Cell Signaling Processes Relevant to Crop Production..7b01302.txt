The physical mechanisms to limit toxicity differ between the metals excess Cu is held largely within plant cell walls whereas Zn is contained within vacuoles.Studies with CuO NPs indicate that the capture of Cu by root cell walls is important to limit Cu flux into the shoots of the rice plant.Both CuO and ZnO NPs increase lignification in roots of several plant species through processes that involve altered peroxidase activities.These changes may be a generalized response to increased ROS in the plant tissue due to enhanced metal levels.The NPs also manipulate the plasticity of root morphology with outcomes that differ between the ZnO and CuO NPs .

In contrast to the increase by ZnO NPs in siderophore production by PcO6 CuO NPs decrease the pyoverdine levels .Analysis of gene expression in the PcO6 cells finds lower transcript abundance from genes encoding the cytoplasmic transporter and proteins involved in periplasmic maturation of the pyoverdine precursor with CuO NPs.Thus the chemistries of these two metal oxide NPs elicit different cellular responses in the microbe.Opposing regulation in PcO6 in response to the two NPs also is observed with the production of a plant growth regulator IAA .

The work illustrates the need for the development of nanoproducts for agriculture to consider not only plant responses to NPs but also the essential role played by the plant's microbiome in plant productivity.Potential Uses of Metal Oxide NPs in Agriculture.

The findings highlight anotherconsequence for the plant to exposure to NPs the induction of a higher level of plant tolerance to drought could be valuable under field conditions.SUMMARY OF RHIZOSPHERE EFFECTS OF CuO AND ZnO NPsCuO and ZnO NPs alter processes important in the rhizosphere that are involved in plant health in addition to the nutritional effect of increased tissue levels of Cu and Zn .

Translocation of NPs into shoots also occurs in rice grown with CuO NPs although the Casparian strip acts as a physical barrier.Although magnetite NPs are not transported into wheat shootsuptake and transport of iron oxide NPs occur in pumpkin.Intracellular trafficking is reported.

ZnO NPs are internalized by root cells of a wetland plantand TiO2 NPs enter maize root cells.The degree of bioaccumulation of metal from CuO NPs is influenced by other factors such as weathering of the NPs.

Wheat seedling growth with ZnO NPs results in increased lateral root formation.genes involved in pyoverdine synthesis in pseudomonads is highly regulated with suppression occurring when Fe is adequate.Although these biochemical changes were demon- strated in broth cultures ZnO NPs also had an impact on siderophore production in PcO6 cells colonizing the roots of beans growing in a solid matrix.Increased pyoverdine levels were detected in bean rhizosphere solutions with the presence of ZnO NPs in the plant growth matrix.The mechanism underpinning altered expression from the siderophore genes is not clear.
