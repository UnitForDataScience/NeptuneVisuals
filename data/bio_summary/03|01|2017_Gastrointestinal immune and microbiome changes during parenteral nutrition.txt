Around 90 of intestinal cells are enterocytes with the remaining 10 comprising specialized endocrine cells called enteroendocrine cells mucus-secreting goblet cells and the specialized microfold cells M cells that cover the Peyer's patch 60.

In response to ingested nutrients and bulk GRP normally stimulates enteroendocrine cell EEC hormone cas- cades that orchestrate intestinal motility digestive enzyme production bile and bicarbonate release splanchnic bed blood flow and electrolyte section which collectively influence the microbial community 16.ENS fibers are found in close approximation with epithelial cells and immune cells providing the ENS with the ability to innervate up to 70 or 80 of the total active immune cells in the body 98.

Specialized epithelial cells M cells cover the luminal surface of Peyer's patches and sample luminal antigen for dendritic cells and naive cxl3 T and B lymphocytes within the germinal centers 60.

Spe- cifically the ratio of CD4 to CD8 as well as the relative percent of memory cells activated cells and naive cells within both the T and B lymphocyte populations remain stable in the Peyer's patch 36.MAdCAM-1 expression on the Peyer's patch high endothe- lial venules is regulated by activation of at least two pathways including lymphotoxin l3 receptor LTl3R and noncanonical NFKB signaling 13.

At the base of the small intestinal crypts Lgr5 stem cells rapidly divide and proliferate feeding cells upward toward the villus tips that result in epithelial replacement every 3-5 days 2.

Tight- junction proteins including zonulins occludins and claudins bind epithelial cells while allowing transient movement of water electrolytes and some macromolecules between cells 46.

PN impacts the gut-associated lymphoid tissue functions especially adaptive immune cells changes the intestinal epithe- lium and chemical secretions and significantly alters the intestinal microbiome.

This review closes by describing recent advances in using enteric nervous system neuropeptides or microbially derived products during PN which may improve GI parameters by maintaining immunity and physiology.parenteral nutrition enteral nutrition gastrointestinal immunity GALT sIgA Paneth cells microbiome mucosal immunityPARENTERAL NUTRITION PN provides essential caloric and mi- cronutrient support intravenously in individuals with contrain- dications to enteral feeding following trauma elective surgery or the need for bowel rest due to inflammatory conditions.

Together these cells defend an enormous interface approaching 400 m2 in humans between the host and external gut environment.

Beneath the epithelial surface a stag- gering number of adaptive and innate immune cells reside in the GI termed the gut-associated lymphoid tissues GALT.
