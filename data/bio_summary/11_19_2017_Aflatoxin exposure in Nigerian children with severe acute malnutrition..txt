AFB1- lysine concentrations were significantly higher in stunted children median  4.6 pgmg compared to non- stunted 1.2 pgmg as well as in children with severe acute malnutrition 4.3 pgmg compared to controls 0.8 pgmg.

Some 21 of the children were suffering from marasmus caloric deficiency and 26 of the children were suffering from kwashiorkor protein deficiency.

Age did not differ significantly between children with kwashiorkor marasmus or controls Kruskal Wallace test P  0.079 while age was marginally significant between stunted and non-stunted children Wilcoxon Rank Sum P  0.05.

The concentration of AFB1-Lys was significantly higher in children with SAM P  0.0083 and in stunted children P  0.032 as compared to controls A C. AFB1-Lys concentrations differed significantlyFig.

AFB1-Lys concentrations did not differ between children with marasmus and controls but were significantly higher in children with kwashiorkor again consistent with previous findings .

Aflatoxin exposure in Nigerian children with severe acute malnutritionAmy McMillan Justin B. Renaud Kevin M.N.

In this report we have used high resolution LC-MSMS with IDMS to quantitate AFB1-lysine in an extremely vulnerable population of Nigerian children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

The median concentrations were also higher in children with kwashiorkor 6.3 pgmg compared to those suffering from marasmus 0.9 pgmg.

Symptoms include vomiting and abdominal pain typically re- sulting in death especially in children  .

Although the general mechanism of growth faltering is unknown poor digestive and barrier functions caused by chronic inflammatory enteropathy of the mucosa of the small intestine is believed to contribute to growth re- tardation in children .
