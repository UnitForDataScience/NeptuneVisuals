Remarkably we found that TNF-a blockade fully protected Ripk1LPC-KO mice from LPS-induced liver injury as demonstratedby the dramatic reduction of serum transaminase levels A the absence of necrotic areas and the reduction of TUNEL and Cl- caspase 3 positive cells in the livers of Ripk1LPC-KO mice B.Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of TNF-a releaseand caspase 3 activation in the livers of Ripk1flfl and Ripk1LPC-KO mice after LPS injection which were prevented by the etanercept pretreatment C.DiscussionHepatocyte death is a key trigger of liver disease progression .

C Pictures of liver tissue sections analyzed by immunohistochemistry for myeloperoxidase MPO issued from Ripk1flfl or Ripk1LPC-KO mice 8.5 h after LPS challenge.we investigated the role of TNF-a in our model by pre-treating Ripk1LPC-KO mice for 1 h with etanercept a TNF-a decoy receptor widely used clinically in humans before LPS injection.

Thus to better understand the protective role of RIPK1 during hepatitis induced by PAMPs administration we continued experiments with the LPS model.Depletion of Kupffer cells reduces LPS-mediated hepatitis inLPC-KOp 0.05 p 0.01 p 0.001 mice treated with LPS or CpG-DNA vs. mice treated with PBS.Ripk1miceResultsDeficiency of RIPK1 in liver parenchymal cells sensitizes the liver to damage induced by PAMPsTo investigate the role of RIPK1 in the liver we used the Ripk1LPC-KO mouse strain which present with a specific deletion of RIPK1 in liver parenchymal cells .

Next first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScriptTM II Reverse Transcriptase Applied Biosystems 4368813 and real-time quantita- tive PCR was performed using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green with the double- strand specific SYBRr Green system Applied Biosystems 4367659 TNF-a Fwd 50-TAG CTC CCA GAA AAG CAA GC-30 Rev 50-TTT TCT GGA GGG AGAJOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGYRipk1flfl mice did not exhibit an increase in serum transaminase levels sera from Ripk1LPC-KO mice revealed a significant increasein ALT and AST after administration of CpG-DNA and severe hep- atolysis after low dose of LPS 0.4 lg20 g of body weight injec- tion A.

Inorder to evaluate their contribution to the severe liver damage induced by LPS in Ripk1LPC-KO mice we specifically depleted mice from their macrophages by treating them for two days with liposome-encapsulated Cl2MBP Lip-Cl2MBP .

In accordance with others we found an important reduc-tion of serum TNF-a level after LPS challenge in mice previouslydepleted from their macrophages  suggesting a deleteri- ous role of TNF-a in Ripk1LPC-KO mice.

These were even more significant in Ripk1LPC-KO mice subjected to LPS administration C.In order to evaluate whether RIPK1 deficiency had any impact on the systemic inflammatory response we measured the levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in CpG-DNA or LPS injectedmice.

Moreover HE coloration and MPO labelling of liver sections showed higher infiltrations of inflammatory cells in Ripk1LPC-KO mice after LPS administration B C and C. Thus whereas CpG-DNA triggered a moderate hepatolysis associated with low inflammation LPS administration induced severe acute hepatocyte death which was associated with more extended pro- inflammatory cytokine expression and more important recruit- ment of inflammatory cells when RIPK1 were absent in liver parenchymal cells.

While abundant F480 pos- itive cells were detected in the liver of sham Ripk1LPC-KO mice LPS challenged controls pretreated with vehicle PBS in place of Lip- Cl2MBP the labelling was dramatically reduced in the liver of LPS challenged animals pretreated with Lip-Cl2MBP .
