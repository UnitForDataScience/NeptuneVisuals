In conclusion our results indicated that L-S60 treatment improved the availability of essential minerals including nitrogen phosphorus and potassium during the seedling process.TABLE 2  A list of the top 50 abundant genera in L-S60 treatment group and the control group.TaxonL-S60 GroupControl Groupp-valueDISCUSSIONBacillus species are well-studied plant growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria likely or primarily due to their capacitiesto produce antibiotics or plant hormones and to form biofilms on the root surface of the plants Idris et al.

Although proteobacteria and actinobacteria were among the most abundant phyla found in all substrate samples L-S60 treatment showed no significant impact on the abundance of these two phyla when compared to the control group Figure 3A.One observed impact by L-S60 inoculation was that the ratio of acidobacteria decreased dramatically from 10.1 - 0.94 in the initial inoculation to 2.1 - 0.25 at 25 days after spout in the treatment group while in the control group the decrease was relatively modest from 12.6 - 0.56 to 6.2 - 0.50 Figure 3A.

The number 60 represents samples collected from L-S60 treatment group ck represents the samples collected from the control group without L-S60 treatment.

Again the higher percentage of Bacillus in the treatment group might be caused by the treatment of L-S60 at the beginning of the experiment.

Thus the changes observed in this study could alsobe due to that application of L-S60 impacted the secretion and composition of the cucumber root exudates at early stages of the seedling development while minimal changes of the bacterial community from day 5 to day 25 in both the treatment and the control groups might indicate relatively stable quantity and composition of the cucumber root exudates during this period of time.On the genus level differences in the rhizosphere microbiome structure were also observed between the L-S60 treatment and the control groups.
