Current research investigating the role the gut microbiome plays in childhood cancer is still in the early stage in terms of either the small sample size or the confounding effects of different types of cancer including type of cancer cancer stages treatment protocols environmental factors and nutritional status on the gut microbiome in chil- dren with cancer.Current science and literature have confirmed the signifi- cant effects of high-dose Methotrexate  Cytarabine Daunorubicine Etoposide  or antibiotic treatments  on the gut microbiome in childhood cancer.

Most studies collected and analyzed fecal samples to address at least one of the following research pur- poses 1 study the effect of cancer diagnosis on the gut microbiome    2 study the effect of cancer treat- ment on the gut microbiome throughout the trajectories of cancer treatment  - 3 study the associations be- tween the gut microbiome and GI symptoms and PNS  and 4 examine the intervention effects of prebiotics probiotics or synbiotics on the gut microbiome in childhood cancer -.Study quality assessmentThe overall quality of the four quantitative non-randomized studies is good all quality scores  75 all use clear sam- pling strategies that decrease the selection bias as well as appropriate study measurements and have acceptable re- sponse rates  -.

FOS did not experience additional GI symp- toms or discomfort when compared with cancer children not receiving FOS .DiscussionHuman gut microbiome is playing a critical role in altering cancer susceptibility and progression by various biological mechanisms such as inflammation DNA damage and bacte- rial metabolites involved in carcinogenesis or tumor suppres- sion  dysbiotic gut microbiome can specifically influence the cancer treatment efficacy and lead to treatment-related toxicities and poor outcomes -.

These factors should be considered when explaining dysbiosis in the gut microbesamong children treated for cancer .Studies proposed that the gut microbiome may play a crit- ical role in cancer diagnosis and treatment  .

Specifically dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is a potential biomarker of GI toxicity in cancer patients  and may be correlated with frequent GI symptoms such as diarrhea and constipation    which has been investigated among adult cancer populations receiving chemotherapy and radio- therapy  .

To be eligible for this review reports had to 1 study the gut microbiome as the primary or secondary outcome of cancer2 focus on children aged 0-21 years with cancer 3 focus on cancer diagnosis treatment or prevention and 4 be pub- lished in English.
