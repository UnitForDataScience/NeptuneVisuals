However long-term use of antibi- otics can induce bacterial resistance  and both the use of antibiotics and dilute bleach baths can cause unneces- sary harm to the commensal flora that is hypothesized to have anti-staphylococcal properties .In the context of the increasing incidence of bacterial resistance the interest in bacteriophages and their endo- lysins as antibacterial therapy has been renewed Staphefekt SA.100 is an engineered chimeric endolysin that specifically lyses the cell membrane of S. aureus via endopeptidase and putative amidase activities - Long-term application of Staphefekt on the skin target- ing only S. aureus and leaving skin commensals unharmed may improve long-term AD outcomes suchas the number of disease flares and may reduce the use of topical corticosteroids.

Taking into consideration the current literature on anti-staphylococcal therapy a study design using a long- term anti-staphylococcal intervention measuring long- term outcomes was chosen.Evidence for the clinical efficacy of Staphefekt registered as a class 1 medical device in Europe is based on in vitro studies and a case series - These in vitro studies showed that Staphefekt kills different strains of S. aureus also methicillin-resistant strains without harming the commensal flora or inducing bacterial resistance  A case series describes clinical improvement in S. aureus re- lated symptoms such as folliculitis and superinfected dermatitis and no development of resistance during long- term daily treatment with Staphefekt based on the min- imal inhibitory concentrations of the cultured S. aureus strains over time .

During the treatment period Staphefekt or placebo cream will be applied on the total skin surface twice daily to reach optimal reduction of S. aureus as both lesional and non-lesional skin are often colonised The Staphefekt endolysin is made available in a cetomacrogol-based cream.

Bacterial resistance to Staphefekt or other endolysins has not been observed and could not be induced which enables us to study the effect of long- term anti-staphylococcal treatment in non-infected AD using this endolysin-based agent   .The aim of this randomized controlled trial the MAAS trial is to evaluate the effect of 3-month anti- staphylococcal therapy with Staphefekt on the frequency and quantity of topical corticosteroid use clinical symp- toms and QoL in patients with moderate to severe AD.

Assuming 10 drop out and 90 of the patients being positive for S. aureus on the skin lesions 50 patients will be assigned to each of the two treatment arms.Randomization and blindingThe participants are randomly assigned in a 11 fashion to either treatment with Staphefekt or placebo.

However Staphefekt is a large protein molecule 50 kDa making penetration through the skin and mucosa and subsequent antibody reactions unlikely Calculation of the sample size for this study was ham- pered as no information was available about the effect of Staphefekt on corticosteroid use and clinical efficacy in AD.

Secondary outcomes include the difference in use of corticosteroid cream measured in grams differences in clinical efficacy quality of life QoL microbial composition includi23ng S. aureus between the Staphefekt and the placebo group and the safety and tolerability.Discussion The results of this trial will provide data about the effect of long-term anti-staphylococcal therapy with Staphefekt on corticosteroid use clinical symptoms and QoL in patients with moderate to severe AD.

propylene glycol clinically infected AD or the existence of other skin conditions that could interfere with the assessment of the AD severity.Recruitment inclusion and consentParticipants with AD will be recruited from the dermatology outpatient clinic of the Erasmus MC and the Havenziekenhuis Rotterdam.

Staphefekt an engineered bacteriophage endolysin specifically kills S. aureus leaving other skin commensals unharmed.
