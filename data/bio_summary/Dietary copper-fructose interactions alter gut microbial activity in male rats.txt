one proposed mechanism by which fructose may cause hepatic lipid accumulation is that fructose is converted to fatty acids at a greater rate than glucose 52. however even with increased de novo lipogenesis it remains largely unknown how 10 of calorie intake from fructose for a typical american or even excessive dietary fructose con- sumption of up to 18 of caloric intake for a nafld patient causes fatty liver 38 52. in fact the intestinal absorptive capacity of fructose is much lower than for glucose 16 17 22 42. in contrast fructose leads to a significantly higher hepatic lipid accumulation than glucose even though the total caloric intake from fructose is less than glucose 8 suggesting that the lipogenic effect of fructose may not merely depend on metab- olism in the liver.a growing body of evidence has shown that gut microbiota play a critical role in the pathogenesis of obesity diabetes and the metabolic syndrome as well as nafld 10 23. interac- tions among diet gut microbiota and host genetics are thought to be critical in the development of obesity and nafld 32 54. in fact the role of fructose in the induction of intestinal bacteria overgrowth gut permeability and endotoxemia is well documented 8 50. several lines of evidence indicate that copper might be involved in the regulation of gut microbiota and gut barrier function.

lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae are two dominant fam- ilies of butyrate-generating bacteria 56. however the oppo- site trend of alterations of these two families in our experimen- tal groups in the current study together with the decreased fecal short-chain fatty acids in cumf and cusf rats in our previous study 58 indicates that future studies on segmentalaclaudin-1 b-actincopper-fructose interactions and nafldcuacuafcumcumfcuscusfg125claudin-1b-actin ratio 1.00 0.441.31 0.22 0.65 0.22 0.26 0.13 0.67 0.12 0.42 0.05cu p0.0001 cuxf p0.0172occludin b-actinoccludinb-actin ratio 1.00 0.280.77 0.320.64 0.11 0.41 0.08 0.43 0.15 0.35 0.04cu p0.0002 f p0.0341reg3b b-actinreg3bb-actin ratio 1.00 0.321.04 0.351.50 0.41 1.81 0.11 2.62 0.75 2.25 0.38cu p0.0001ileum pas x 100cuacumcus versus cua fructose - versus cua fructose  versus cum fructose - versus cum fructose fructose -fructose 50fructose-403020100cuacumcusfructose versus cua fructose -fig.

further study is needed to examine whether copper homeostasis directly acts on the integrity of the gut barrier andor acts via inducing gut microbiome dysbiosis.another interesting finding is that endotoxemia is present in only cumf rats but not in cusf rats.
