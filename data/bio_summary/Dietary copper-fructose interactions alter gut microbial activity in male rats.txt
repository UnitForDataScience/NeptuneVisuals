Third the alterations of gut microbiome induced by dietary low and high copper with or without fructose differ mainly within the phylum Firmicutes.copper fructose gut microbiome gut barrier function NAFLDINTRODUCTIONNonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is now the most common liver disease in the United States with an increasing prevalence worldwide.

At the phylum level while Firmicutes was significantly increased in CuMF CuS and CuSF rats Bacteroidetes was decreased in CuMF rats which led to a robustly increased FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio in CuMF rats compared with CuA rats 19.87 Vs. 6.46 CuMF vs. CuA.

In contrast fructose leads to a significantly higher hepatic lipid accumulation than glucose even though the total caloric intake from fructose is less than glucose 8 suggesting that the lipogenic effect of fructose may not merely depend on metab- olism in the liver.A growing body of evidence has shown that gut microbiota play a critical role in the pathogenesis of obesity diabetes and the metabolic syndrome as well as NAFLD 10 23.

Further study is needed to examine whether copper homeostasis directly acts on the integrity of the gut barrier andor acts via inducing gut microbiome dysbiosis.Another interesting finding is that endotoxemia is present in only CuMF rats but not in CuSF rats.

In this study we fed rats with different levels of copper with or without fructose to evaluate the role of dietary copper-fructose interactions in the etiology of hepatic steatosis from the per- spective of gut microbiota and gut barrier function.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal experiments.
