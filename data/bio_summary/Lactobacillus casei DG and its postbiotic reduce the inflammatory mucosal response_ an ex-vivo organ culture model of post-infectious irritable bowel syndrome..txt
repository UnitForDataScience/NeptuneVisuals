However strengths of our study are the rigorous selection of the patients the ex vivo organ culture model we used the sampling of both ileal and left colon mucosa and the analysis of the effect of both the probiotic strain LC-DG and its PB on the inflamma- tory response of the intestinal mucosa.ConclusionsLC-DG and its PB attenuate the inflammatory mucosal response in an ex-vivo organ culture model of PI-IBS D. These findings provide biological plausibility to the therapeutically usefulness of this probiotic strain in the clinical setting of PI-IBS D. Well designed and powered clinical trials are advisable to confirm the therapeutic efficacy in the real life management of these patients.AbbreviationsFBS Fetal bovine serum HC Healthy controls IBS Irritable bowel syndrome IBS-C Irritable bowel syndrome IBS with constipation IBS-D Irritable bowel syndrome IBS with diarrhea IBS-M Mixed irritable bowel syndrome IBS-U Unsubtyped irritable bowel syndrome IL Interleukin LC-DG Lactobacillus casei DG LPS Lipopolysaccharides LPS Postbiotic PI-IBS D Post infectious irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea predominant subtype PI-IBS Post- infectious irritable bowel syndrome Irritable bowel syndrome SIBO Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth TLRs Toll like receptorsAcknowledgmentsNot applicable.FundingSOFAR S.p.A.Availability of data and materialsThe dataset generated during the present study is available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author Prof. G.

Similarly PB treatment was effective in reducing IL-1a IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels in both colonic p  0.0001 p  0.0001 and p  0.0001 respectively and ileal mucosa p  0.0001 p  0.0006 and p  0.0001 respectively.

Incontrast the magnitude of the anti-inflammatory response did not significantly differ between HC and IBS-D irre- spective of mucosal site.In PI-IBS D the treatment of colonic biopsies with LC-DG significantly reduced the levels of all pro- inflammatory cytokines Il-1 a p  0.002 IL-6 p  0.0001 and IL-8 p  0.0001 in respect to baseline.

DiscussionIn our study the baseline expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines namely IL-1a Il-6 and Il-8 was significantly higher and that of IL-10 significantly lower in the intes- tinal mucosa of PI-IBS D patients in respect to HC.An increased number of lamina propria lymphocytes and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines with a parallel decrease of mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines have been described in colonic mucosa of PI-IBS as compared to non-PI-IBS and control subjects 14 Moreover PI-IBS patients had an increased expression of IL-1a mRNA in terminal ileum and recto-sigmoidal mucosa These data support the hypothesis that the immune dysfunction and the dysregulated neuroimmune interactions may predispose individuals to IBS Based on this pathophysiological model an event such asinfection would generate permanent disturbances of the gut microbiota with overgrowth of pathogens and a marked reduction in bacterial diversity.

In details TLR-4 protein expression was 7.4-folds higher in ileal mucosa p  0.0001 and 3-folds higher in colonic mucosa p  0.001 of PI-IBS D patients as compared with HC.

and However the magni- tude of the inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa that is the difference between LPS-induced mRNA levels and baseline values was greater in patients than in HC in both ileal and colonic mucosa Il-1a p  0.0001 IL-6 p  0.0001 and IL-8 p  0.0001.

Moreover growing data mainly obtained by the analysis of Lactobacilli strains support the evidence that these beneficial effects may depend on secreted probiotic-derived factors recently identified as postbiotic PB mediators .MethodsAim of this study was to evaluate the role of Lactobacillus casei DG LC-DG and its PB in modulating the inflam- matory immune-response in an ex-vivo organ culture model of PI-IBS D. Patients with a diagnosis of PI-IBS who met Rome III criteria for IBS-D were consecutively recruited among 92 patients with IBS referred to the Gastroenterology Unit of the University Federico II of Naples from December 2014 to June 2015.

The patients confirmed IBS onset after an episode of acute gastroenteritis with diarrhea andor vomiting occurred at least one year before the enrollment thus fulfilling the definition of PI-IBS .

The stimulation of intestinal mucosa with 100 mgml LPS significantly increased mRNA levels of all cytokines in respect to baseline in both HC and PI-IBS D patients Figs.
