The probiotic characterization was based upon the assessment of some classical traits survival at pH 2.5 and with bile salts added antibiotic resistance as well as on some screening protocols for the evaluation of the ability to adhere to the mucosa of the gut hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation indices and the antimicrobial activity towards pathogens.Regarding the survival of the isolates to gastric pH and their tolerance to bile salts at pH 2.0 viability loss was not significant after 3 h data not shown otherwise it varied from 0.2 to 1 log cfu ml isolates 20 45 62 and 68 to 3e4 log cfuml isolates 2 7 10 40 and 64 after 24 h. At pH 2.5 viability loss was less significant.

15 oC Growth index at 15 oC 5 and 7.5 NaCl Growth Index in MRS supplemented with salt pH 4 and pH 10 Growth Index in MRS adjusted to pH 4 and 10 acidification pH decrease in MRS.validation is a kind of riskbenefit analysis as it is not possible to find a super-microorganism.

For the group 1 A factor 1 and factor 2 accounted 60 of the total variability moreover the variables acidification pH 4 pH 10 5 NaCl and 7.5 NaClwere related to factor 1 whereas the variable 15 oC was related tofactor 2.As a function of the factor 1 the factorial space could be divided in two regions the first at left quadrants II and III for the isolates with the highest acidification and able to grow at pH 4.0 and the second at the right quadrants I and IV for the isolates able to grow in presence of salt or at pH 10.0.

The pH was evaluated by immersing the probe approxi- mately 1e2 cm below the casings.The analyses were performed on two independent batches per each batch two replicates were analyzed 80 different samples were analyzed 5 measurements of pH for two batches and each batch in duplicate for 4 series.The results were modelled as pH decrease and fitted through a lag-exponential model   cast in the following formodor b slime production or discoloration color c after the application of finger pressure muscle returns more than half way texture.The outlier test was preliminary done on the sensory scores to highlight and eliminate the outliers then the scores were analyzed through the Krustal-Wallis to assess the basic requisite of the normal distribution and finally by one-way ANOVA using Tukey's test as the post-hoc comparison test P  0.05.

The in vitro low pH tolerance study revealed that 7 isolates at pH 2.5 showed equal percent of viability as compared to pH 7 control.

The numbers on the bars indicate the isolates per each class while the curves are the normal distri- butions fitted to the data.conditions at pH 2 no isolate was able to grow whereas at pH 3 most of the targets showed a moderate-to-strong inhibition with a GI in the range 25.96e50.51 mean value of 40.05 - 4.22 .

Lactic Acid Bacteria LAB are the dominant microorganisms in many fer- mented fish products where their primary role is to ferment car- bohydrates and reduce pH the combination of low pH below 4.5 and organic acids mainly lactic acid is the main preservation factor in this kind of products .

This assay involves the use of a laboratory medium containing amino acids as pre- cursors of amines and a pH indicator bromocresol purple when pH increases for the decarboxylation of amino acids the color turns from green to purple.

Then the variables were used to carry out a Principal Component Analysis to choose the most promising isolates for probiotic characterization section .Probiotic characterizationSurvival at pH 2.0 2.5 and with 0.3 of bile salt addedAfter bacteria growth at 30 oC in MRS broth for 24 h cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 g for 10 min suspended in sterile distilled water adjusted to pH 2.0 or 2.5 or supplemented with bile salt 0.3 wv Oxoid and incubated at 37 oC.

After mixing through a sterile glass rod samples were mechanically stuffed into collagen casings 28 mm diameter andleft to ferment at 30 oC for 7 days.The fermentation was monitored by measuring the pH througha pH electrode 5050T CRISON Crison Instruments Barcelona Spain.
