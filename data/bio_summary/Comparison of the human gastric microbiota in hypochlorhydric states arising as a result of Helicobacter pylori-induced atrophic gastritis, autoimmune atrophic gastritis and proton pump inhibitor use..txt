pylori colonisation was associated with a decrease in gastric bacterial diversity and domi- nance of this organism which is highly adapted to the gastric environment has also been reported previously.The majority of changes observed in H. pylori gastritis and H. pylori-induced atrophic gas- tritis samples were due to reductions in non-H. pylori bacteria.

pylori carriage since technical controls were included in each sequencing run and these con- trols showed lower diversity and levels of H. pylori than the samples Figs .

The H. pylori gastritis and H. pylori atrophic gastritis samples were dominated by Proteobacteria as Helicobacter itself is a member of this phylum whilst biopsies from patients with autoimmune atrophic gastritis contained the largest proportion of Firmicutes compared to all other patient groups.Alpha diversity.

When H. pylori was removed from the analysis however H. pylori gastritis patients no longer clustered separately by abundance from subjects with normal stomachs .

Despite this following removal of H. pylori there was a significant difference in abundance for H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis patients compared to normal stomachs suggesting strongly that there are dif- ferences in the proportions of non-H. pylori bacteria in these subjects compared with others .

pylori did not skew the proportions of the other bacteria in a misrepresentational way H. pylori OTUs were removed from the abundance table followed by differential expression analysis on the remaining raw abundances.
