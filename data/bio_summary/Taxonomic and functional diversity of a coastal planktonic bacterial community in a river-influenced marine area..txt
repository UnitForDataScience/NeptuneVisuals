hsp70 protein transcripts were significantly 2-fold increased at all stations but distributed among different taxonomic groups at the different stations at s1 to enterobacteriaceae 0.2 ppm relative abundance at s2 to candidatus pelagibacter 1 ppm relative abun- dance and to oceanobacter 0.4 ppm relative abundance at s3 to rhodobacterales 4.9 ppm to gammaproteobacteria 0.5 ppm and to oceanibaculum 0.2 ppm at s4 to alphaproteobacteria 0.7 ppm rela- tive abundance - .predicted amidohydrolase - cog0388 transcripts were found inmany different taxonomic groups but never exceeded 1 ppm relative abundance .

in addition asmall but steep decrease from s4 to s1 was observed for the candidate division od1 which increased from undetectable to 1.1. other abun- dant otus showed similar abundances at all stations in particular with- in gammaproteobacteria pseudoalteromonadales 3.1 - 0.6 alteromonadales 1.3 - 0.3 and other gammaproteobacteria 2.0 - 0.3 b. this analysis showed that marine groups such as euryarchaea oceanospirillales deferribacterales verrucomicrobia in- cluding the marine mb11c04 rhodospirillales and flavobacteriales pro- vide an increasing contribution towards the marine station s1 while the opposite was true for campylobacterales and several other minor fresh- water-associated groups suggesting their marine and river origin re- spectively .

at s3 glaciecola gammaproteobacteria and balneatrix related transcripts were found with 0.3 ppm 0.3 ppm and 0.2 ppm relative abundance while roseobacter and glaciecola-related transcripts were found with0.2 ppm relative abundance each at s4 .the low abundance of transcripts related to stress-related genes might be due to the low residence time of the bacterial communities in the river plume and consequently only short exposure time to the stressor.

the highest bacterial transcript abundance was attributed to gammaproteobacteria dominated by oceanospirillales ranging from 3.9 at s4 to 8.6 at s1 b. similar- ly alphaproteobacteria dominated by rhodospirillales rhodobacterals rickettsiales and pelagibacterales increased from 11.5 s4 to 16.7 s1 and verrucomicrobia dominated by the mb11c04 marine group increased from 5.6 s4 to 9.7 s1.

overall this is consistent with the detection of only minor influences of the river on the community composition suggesting a generally low impact of the sarno river on the marine planktonic bacterial and ar- chaeal community.a comparison with 179 other metagenomes available in the img mer database showed that our samples clustered always with coastal and pure marine samples e.g.

marinochromatium is known to thrive in anoxic sediments stag- nant water pools or micro- or anoxic cores of detrital aggregates and therefore its presence can be considered as a trace of the sarno river re-suspended sediments.psii-related transcripts were mainly attributed to prochlorococcusand synechococcus and were higher at s1 with 22.7 ppm for prochlorococcus and 20.2 ppm for synechococcus c. prochlorococcus-affiliated transcripts dominated at s1 s2 and s3 while were almost absent at s4.

this supports the hypothesis of the higher importance of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa such as nitrosopumilus over ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob  .relative transcript abundance of the aprb gene was highest at s2 6.1 ppm and relatively lower at s1 s3 and s4 with 3.7 ppm4.1 ppm and 4.5 ppm respectively b. these transcripts were mainly attributed to candidatus pelagibacter.

transcripts of the dsrab genes mainly attributed to thioalkalivibrio and other gammaproteobacteria were highest at s2 2.6 ppm and decreased to- wards s3  0.5 ppm and s4 0.6 ppm.

bacteroidetes and archaea were also found in rel- atively high abundance similar to other marine communities of the mediterranean sea or the atlantic ocean  .the gammaproteobacterial oceanospirillales showed the highest se- quence abundance at all stations with 16.0 - 0.3 followed by the alphaproteobacterial rhodospirillales ranging between 10.8 s4 and 14.6 s3 and dominated by the aegean-169 marine group.

.based on this hypothesis we have investigated the residential mi- crobial community using high throughput sequencing illumina and combined with flow cytometry and a wide array of environmental data so to assess how the river waters affect the residential marine mi- crobes and their metabolic functioning.materials and methodssamplingsurface samples were taken by a rosette sampler equipped with niskin bottles on board the rv vettoria on november 28th 2013 at four stations s1 40.7245degn 14.3775dege s2 40.7250degn 14.3998dege s3 40.7255degn 14.4477dege s4 40.7268degn 14.4613dege .samples for dissolved inorganic nutrient din analyses 20 ml were frozen on board while those for chlorophyll 1 l were immediate- ly filtered onto gff filters whatman ge heathcare lifesciences milan italy and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

hence their presence in the sampled area could be due to upwelling of deeper oligo- trophic waters induced by the general circulation of the tyrrhenian sea as already reported in the area .even though the bacterial and archaeal community were widely dominated by marine representatives some indicators of river influence were detected at stations with lower salinity s3 and s4.

this in turn may have detri- mental effects on the whole ecosystem functioning and also on human health .the present study represents a snapshot of the marine bacterialcommunity at a marine site where salinity indicates a little residual di- lution of freshwater from the sarno river.

a functional com- parison between stations was realized with the imgmer platform using z-lor values of pfam families  .results and discussionsalinity temperature ph nutrients and chlorophyll asalinity decreased from 35.943 at s4 to 37.956 at s1 marking the freshwater inputs as progressively diluting into the marine waters even though all stations were outside of the river plume itself.
