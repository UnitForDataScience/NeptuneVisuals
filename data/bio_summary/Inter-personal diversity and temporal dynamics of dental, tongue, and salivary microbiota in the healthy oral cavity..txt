For example Bulleidia moorei was found in 95 of tongue plaque and saliva samples but 95 of supragingival plaque samples while Rothia dentocariosa was found in 95 of the samples from all three sites.

Also notably in contrast to saliva and supragingival samples that showed significant differ- ences in PD between subjects no significant differences were observed between subjects across tongue samples Fig.

All three sites pooled together had a prediction accuracy of 83.3 supragingival plaque had an accuracy of 75 one misclassification whereas tongue plaque and saliva samples achieved 100 accuracy.Twenty-six core OTUs persist across sites individuals and time In order to highlight the most consistent members of the oral microbiota we identified coreOTUs that were present in95 of all collected samples.

In particular bacterial biomarkers in saliva are being investigated for their use in treatment monitoring during oral diseases such as periodontitis and caries-and researchers are investigating the correlation between the salivary microbiota and diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseaseand pancreatic cancer.The higher OTU count and wider inter-subject variation in PD seen in saliva can be attributed to the saliva bathing other oral sites such as the supragingival tooth surface and picking up additional microbial taxa.

We trained an additional random-forest classifier against all of the samples collected in the first 90 days and predicted the source subject of the 12 samples taken at 365 days.

For the classification of the 1-year samples only the samples from that time-point were held out of the training set.

Community diversity was variable between individuals but remained consistent within an individual over time.RESULTSTo investigate the longitudinal stability and characterize intra-- and inter-individual variability of the plaque and salivary micro- biota 286 samples containing supragingival plaque tongue dorsum plaque and saliva were obtained from ten healthy volunteers over a period of 90 days sampled on days 1 2 3 4 714 21 28 60 and 90.

When supragin- gival plaque samples are excluded from the analysis tongue plaque and saliva communities show clear differences but with a much smaller effect size Fig.
