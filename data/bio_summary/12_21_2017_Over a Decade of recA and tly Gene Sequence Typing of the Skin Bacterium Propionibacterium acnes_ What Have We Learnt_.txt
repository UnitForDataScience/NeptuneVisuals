these high-resolution mlst and whole genome sequencing wgs methods have however also revealed caveats with reca and tly sequencing since the combination of reca and tly allele sequences originally used to identify the type ib phylogroup have now also been found in a subset of clearly defined type ia1 strains from cc4 mlst8 nomenclature all strains from the ia2 lineage and the aberrant type ia1 singleton strain sk187 which displays a mosaic of genes found in other type i lineages including type ib .this is illustrated in figure a which demonstrates phylogenetic clustering of strains crossing these different genetic distances based on concatenated reca and tly gene sequences 1824 bp the same clustering of strains is seen with single reca and tly trees figure s1 yet clear non-overlapping clustering of these phylogroups when high resolution mlst8 analysis is applied figure b. these results help to explain why a sub-set of strains presumptively identified as type ib based on reca and tly analysis displayed reaction with the type ia mab qubpa1 .p.

against this background it is interesting that only type ii strains have an active crisprcas system making type i and iii strains potentially more susceptible to horizontal gene transfer hgt of fitness and virulence traits .bnctc737 cc1 266 cc1 hl007pa1 cc3 sk137 cc372hl110pa2 cc4hl002pa1 cc2kpa171202 cc5 p.acn31 cc2type ia1type ia1 type ia2 type ibtype ia2100cc1cc3 cc4st102 cc486type ia1100hl082pa1 cc4type ia1cc2 type ia2p.acn17 snt p6 cc56609 cc5prp-38 cc107type ia2 type ib8710072st94 cc4type ia1100cc107type ic100hl097pa1 cc107 pmh5pmh7hl201pa1type ictype iiicc599type ib100type iii0.002atcc11828 100 hl0001pa1j139type ii0.002100type iifigure 2. minimum evolution phylogenetic trees of concatenated reca and tly sequences 1824 bp from isolates selected to represent all known phylogroups a and concatenated gene sequences 4235 bp from all current sts in the mlst8 database b the latter is updated from  with sts.

collectively such studies started to reveal differences in pathogenic potential between phylogroups and their association with human disease.reca and tly gene sequencing to characterise p. acnes type zappe strainsreca and tly gene sequence analysis has even been used to characterize strains of the grapevine-associated p. acnes lineage known as p. acnes type zappe .

interestingly although p. acnes type zappe forms a distinctphylogenetic cluster from p. acnes upon 16s rdna analysis it groups with p. acnes type i strains based on reca and tly sequences.

furthermore unlike p. acnes the reca gene in p. acnes type zappe appears to have lost its function during this unusual host switching event possibly reflecting endosymbiosis leading to the accumulation of a large number of non-synonymous mutations in comparison the tly and 16s rrna genes of p. acnes type zappe are much more conserved.

no evidence of statistically significant recombination was identified in either genes using the phi test p  0.135 for reca p  0.735 for tly although some interconnected pathways were present.newer molecular typing methodologies for propionibacterium acnesas the reca and tly loci cannot reliably identify type ib strains from those related to the type ia1 sub-clade corresponding to cc4 or strains of type ia2 their application as a typing tool has limitations the methods are still valid however for the identification of almost all other type ia1 strains as well as those from the type ic ii and iii phylogroups.

in this review we will look back at the introduction of dna sequence typing of p. acnes based on reca and tly loci and then describe how these methods provided a basic understanding of the population genetic structure of the bacterium and even helped characterize the grapevine-associated lineage of p. acnes known as p. acnes type zappe which appears to have undergone a host switch from humans-to-plants.

both antibodies which target antigenically variable cell surface adhesins that bind dermatan sulphate dsa1 dsa2 qubpa1 and a glycolipid-containing antigen qubpa2 show no significant reaction with the type ib lineage but do react with type ic strains  other type i strains designated type ia react with qubpa1 but not qubpa2.

we now know these pulsogroups actually correspond to the reca and tly types ia ib and ii  in the same study sequencing of the transcarboxylase 12s gene could differentiate pulsogroups i type ia and ii type ib from group iii type ii but could not further subtype the type i clade.

despite this the limited number of snps available can differentiate the main type i ii and iii phylogroups from one another as well as type ia1 from ia2 strains which have unique rts in keeping with their distinct phylogenies table .table 1. correlation between ribotypes phylogroups and mlst ccs.within the type ia1 clade strains corresponding to cc4 by mlst8 analysis equivalent to cc31 by mlst9 can also be resolved but a limitation of the method is that strains from cc1 and cc3 by mlst8 analysis equivalent to cc18 and cc3 respectively by mlst9 as well as type ib and ic strains cannot be separated as they share rt1 and rt5 table .

specific issues or caveats with reca and tly sequence typing will then be highlighted alongside a detailed description of newer high resolution molecular typing methods that have been developed to characterize the bacterium and better detail its phylogeny.bfigure 1. moderate inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions on the forehead a and shoulderof a 14-year-old adolescent boy.introduction of reca and tly gene sequencing for phylogenetic analysis of p. acnesgene sequence analysis of p. acnes based on the non-ribosomal housekeeping hk gene reca 1047 bp ppa1012 and the putative haemolysinftsj-like methyltransferase gene tly 777 bp ppa1396 was first described in 2005 as part of a larger study investigating the phylogenetic relationship between the two serotypes of p. acnes known as types i and ii .
