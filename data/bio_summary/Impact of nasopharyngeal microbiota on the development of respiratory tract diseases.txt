However a switch to the Moraxella - and Corynebacterium - Dolosigranulum-dominated profiles already cited as potential beneficial bacterial strains was demonstrated in a significantly earlier stage in children born by vaginal delivery compared to the children born by C-section suggesting that the increased risk of short- and long-term respiratory morbidity frequently reported in children born by C-section might be due at least in part to the impact of this mode of delivery on the URT microbiota composition  .Regarding the type of feeding it has been evidenced that breastfeeding can be significantly more effective in condition- ing the development of a protective nasopharyngeal microbiota than formula feeding.

found that Moraxella was the most common genus dom- inating 21 and 38 of all nasopharyngeal microbiota collect- ed in healthy children and in children with respiratory disease respectively .

The same authors evidenced that increased presence of Haemophilus could be detected during summer months whereas Moraxella-dominated microbiota were more com- mon during winter.Nasopharyngeal microbiota in otherwise healthy children with respiratory infectionUpper respiratory infections URIs and lower respiratory in- fections LRIs are extremely frequent in children particularly in the first years of life.

monitored a group of children between 6 weeks and 6 months of age and reported that Dolosigranulum abundance was negatively associated with the number of URIs from which the children suffered in that period .

reported a strict association between Streptococcus- Haemophilus- and Moraxella-dominated mi- crobiota and the risk of URI whereas the opposite was evi- denced in subjects with Corynebacterium- and Alloiococcus- dominated microbiota .Similar findings were reported when respiratory microbiota was studied in children with AOM the most common bacte- rial disease in infants and young children .
