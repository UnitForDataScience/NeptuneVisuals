The obtained data also suggest that Eucalyptus may benefit from biological nitrogen fixation with many abundant genera being closely related to nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

Nitrogen fixing bacteriaIntroductionThe planted forest in Brazil forms a cultivated area of 7.8 million hectares of which the genus Eucalyptus makes upElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article doiy contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

The soil is classified as a Haplic Solonetz according to the FAOUNESCO system of soil classification Planosolo haplico according to the Brazilian Soil Taxonomy characterized by sandy topsoil 90 sand low cation exchange capacity CEC and low organic matter 0.65 total carbon and nutrient contents.

The climate of the study area is classified as Aw tropical with a dry winter.

The average annual precipitation is 1250 mm the air temper- ature ranges from 16 degC June and July to 32 degC January to March and the mean relative air humidity is 73.

The relief is smooth the soil has low fertility and the natural vegetation is composed of rainforest.Experimental Design and SamplingIn December of 2011 the sampling was performed at an ex- perimental site where Eucalyptus is cultivated with different management practices.

The treatments were installed in four blocks distributed in the experimental field.

The same density of Eucalyptus 0.11 trees m-2 was maintained and the Acacia were introduced between Eucalyptus in the plant- ing row resulting in 0.22 trees m-2.

The roots were collected at the depth of 10-30 cm no more than 1 m from the tree.

The root fragments were basically fine ramifications from second- ary roots.
