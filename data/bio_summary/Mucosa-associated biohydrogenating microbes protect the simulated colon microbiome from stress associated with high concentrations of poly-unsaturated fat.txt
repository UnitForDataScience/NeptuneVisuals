the interplay of the colon microbiota with the human host is the result of a long synchronised co- evolution blaser and kirschner 2007. consumption of high fatlow fibre diets has been increasingly associated with dis- ruption of this host-microbe cooperation de filippo et al.

however small losses to the colon can occur vonk et al.

2005.among the different types of dietary fat that may impact colon microbiome homeostasis polyunsaturated fatty acidspufas are of particular interest because of their antimicro- bial potential desbois and smith 2010. the major pufa present in the western diet is linoleic acid la cis-9cis- 12 c182 faowho 2008 blasbalg et al.

lactobacillus species were demonstrated to be highly sensitive to la as opposed to opportunistic patho- gens such as escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae de weirdt et al.

2013. however survival of lactobacillus reuteri upon la exposure was improved when a mucosal environment was present m-shime de weirdt et al.

2013. this protective effect may be partially attributed to mucins which lowered the contact between la and the bac- terial membrane de weirdt et al.

these species either isomerize la to a variety of conjugated la cla andor gradually saturate la to less antimicrobial products such as vaccenic acid va trans-11 c181 and stearic acid sa c180 devillard et al.
