In order to determine to what degree the individual metabolites vary between tissue types it is necessary to begin grouping individual metabolites identifying those that can be dereplicated and observing families of unknown metabolites.LC-MS features are the first level of mass spectrometric data but molecular fragmentation MSMS spectra were also collected.

Therefore the data was filtered by removing all MSMS peaks within a 17 Da window of the precursor mz and MSMS spectra were filtered by choosing only the top 6 peaks in 50 Da windows.

Of those 92 consensus spectra matched thereby to spectra from the libraries within a mass error of 20 ppm yielding a 1.6 annotation rate.

Together with MSMS spectra library matching and spectral networking this non-targeted workflow provides the highest sensitivity and selectivity for the molecular annotations and imaging of plants laying the foundation for studies of plant metabolism and plant-environment interactions.Keywords plant metabolomics imaging mass spectrometry 3D-imaging tomato pepperINTRODUCTIONPhototrophs form the foundational layer of energy and nutrient capture in essentially all terrestrial and marine ecosystems  .

Experimental spectra were compared to different reference libraries including the ReSpect library of phytochemical MSMS spectra  .
