This result was unexpected because it has been reported that chronic administration of PPIs caused a moderate alteration in fecal microbiome when groups with and without PPI administration were compared.32-34 In the present study different from prior investigations a PPI was administered at a standard dose for 4 weeks to healthy individuals then the microbiome in the obtained samples was compared before and after that administration in the same subjects.

However a number of possible side effects have recently been suggested including nutritional deficiencies increased risk of bone fracture and risks of enteric and other infections.13-15 Notably reports of increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and community acquired pneumonia indicate that PPI administration may carry a risk equivalent to that related to oral antibiotics use16-20 while another study reported a significant increase in salivary pH after PPI administration for con- trol of GERD.21 Therefore acid inhibition in the upper gastroin- testinal tract may have an effect on the oral microbiome leading to microbiota alteration.18-20In the present study we investigated the influence of PPI usage on oral and gut microbiota using 16S rRNA profiling of saliva periodontal pocket fluid and fecal samples obtained from healthy volunteers who were not taking antibiotics or other medications.

Furthermore Streptococcus abundance in both salivary and periodontal pocket microbiota also showed a trend to be higher after PPI usage as compared with the baseline values al- though the difference was not statistically significant P  0.106 0.188 while Fusobacterium and Leptotrichia organisms were also detected more frequently following PPI administration in peri- odontal pocket fluid P  0.030 q  NS and P  0.002 q  0.05.

Therefore following a 4-week administration of esomeprazole at a standard dose gut microbiota alteration caused by PPI administration was considered to be limited with only some bacteria such as Streptococcus showing changes.

We obtained fecal saliva and periodontal pocket fluid samples from 10 healthy adult volunteers before and after administration of esomeprazole at 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks.

Periodontal pocket fluid samples without saliva or blood contamination were collected by a single dental surgeon K. T.. Two periodontal pockets were sampled at the two collection time points before and 4 weeks after start of esomeprazole administration.

Comparisons of alpha diversity microbiota diversity within each sample revealed no significant differences between with and without PPI administration in any of the sali- vary periodontal pocket fluid and fecal samples according to the estimated OTU numbers obtained using the Chao 1 index Fig.

NS q  0.05.Recent accumulating evidence indicates that frequent adminis- tration of PPIs has raised the ratio of Streptococcus organisms which are predominantly found in the upper gastrointestinal tract in the fecal microbiome leading to increased risks for gas- tric and intestinal microbiota alteration.17 In this study the ge- nus Streptococcus was also increased after PPI administration in all three types of samples although the difference in saliva and periodontal pocket fluid did not reach a statistically signifi- cant level.
