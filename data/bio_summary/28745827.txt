The stability of purified catPL12 at different pH levels was estimated by measuring the enzyme activity after incubating the enzyme solution in the buffers at 30 degC for 1 h with the untreated enzyme defining 100 activity.

The effects of different Fe3 concentrations on purified catPL12 activity were studied under standard conditions with FeCl3 at a final concentration of 0.1 0.5 1.0 5.0 and 10.0 mM.The substrate specificity of catPL12 was evaluated by incubating the enzyme with 0.5 mM 3-methylcatechol 4-methylcatechol 4-chlorocatechol hydroquinone and protocatechuate for assaying the activity under optimal temperature and pH conditions.

Metal ions and othersThe inhibitory or stimulatory effects on catPL12 of metal ions and chemical reagents were determined Table The catechol 12-dioxygenase activity of catPL12 was up-regulated byapproximately 1.4-fold when the enzyme reaction was conducted in the presence Pb2 1 mM.

Substrate specificityThe relative activities of catPL12 to various substrates are presented in Table catPL12 was able to cleave 3-methylcatechol 4-methylcatechol and 4-chlorocatechol at lower rates than catechol but neither enzyme showed activity with hydroquinone and protocatechuate.

Enzyme thermostability was determined after pre-incubating the enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 at 37 40 and 45 degC without substrate during 1 h or at 25 degC and 35 degC for 0-26 h with the untreated enzyme defining 100 activity.The effect of metal ions and chemicals on purified catPL12 activity was measured in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 at 25 degC with different metal salts and chemical agents at a final concentration of 1 mM.

The extinction coefficients of the product of 3-methylcatechol 4-methylcatechol 4- chlorocatechol hydroquinone and protocatechuate were 18000M cm at 260 nm 14300M cm at 255 nm 12500M cm at 259 nm 11000M cm at 320 nm and 3890M cm at 290 nm .The kinetic parameters were calculated by a non-linear regression analysis using Origin 8.5 software Reactions were performed in 50 mM Tris- HCl buffer pH 8.0 at 25 degC with catechol at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 0.5 mM.The impact of inhibitors on enzyme activity of purified catPL12 was evaluated by incubating the enzyme with various phenols for 5 min at room temperature and then assaying the residual activity under optimal temperature and pH conditions.

Conversely Hg2 Co2 Zn2 and SDS at a concentration of 1 mM dramatically reduced the enzymatic activity.Previous studies reported that many C12O were ferric- dependent enzyme which ferric ion were used as the sole cofactors for C12O However some studies have shown that C12O activity was completely inhibited by different concentrations of Fe3 Thus effects of different Fe3 concentrations on recombinant enzyme catPL12 were studied Table When the Fe3 concentration was 0.5 mM the promoting effect was most obvious.

Most of the phenolic com- pounds studied affected enzyme activity of catPL12 at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mM but the effects were not obvious Table  DISCUSSIONCatechol 12-dioxygenase is the key enzyme for catalyzing the cleavage of the aromatic ring of catechol to ccMA.

For CatA 1 h of pre- incubation at 25 and 37 degC resulted in 35 and 100 loss of enzyme activity respectively However 100 of the catPL12 enzyme activity was retained after 1 h of incubation at 25 and 37 degC.

None of the enzymes coded by these C12O genes has been biochemically characterized.As reported previously C12O catalyze the intradiol cleavage by molecular oxygen of their respective catecholic substrates using a nonheme ferric ion Fe3 as a cofactor that was ligated by conserved two histidine residues and two tyrosine residues Amino acid sequence alignment of catPL12 with different catechol 12-dioxygenase showed that lipid-binding sites Fe-ligands and the active sites of the C12O were identified in catPL12 Fig.
