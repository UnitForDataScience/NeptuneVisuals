For each disease the potential associated microbes can be ranked according to the prediction probability scores.The top ranked microbes indicate the most relevant associations potentially providing valu- able information for further microbe-disease association research.CBGs in the microbe-disease association network.

It is a global strategy that explores the missing microbe-disease associations simultaneously and can predict novel related microbes for diseases without any known associated microbe information.More specifically we present a novel computational approach that executes a bi-random walk algorithm on the heterogeneous network to predict potential microbe-disease associa- tions BiRWHMDA.

Accordingly a potential microbe-disease association is evaluated by its distance to other associations in the microbe similarity network and the disease similarity network .Bi-random walk explores the CBG patterns by iteratively performing random walk on the microbe similarity network and the disease similarity network simultaneously to infer novel microbe-disease associations .

The top 10 candidate microbes for IBD obtained from PBHMDA are also listed in  of these eight microbes have been previ- ously validated   -.In summary these case studies further demonstrate that the approach we proposed is pow- erful in predicting novel microbe-disease associations.

built the Human Microbe-Disease Association Database HMDAD by collecting microbe-disease association data from 61 previous published studies providing a valuable informational resource for investigating microbe-disease associations.

The microbe interaction profile mi is a binary vector encoding the presence or absence of the associations with each disease in the known microbe-disease association network defined as the ith column of the adjacency matrix A of the microbe-disease association network con- structed above.

These methods are similar in that they are all accomplished based on a heterogeneous network which is constructed by connecting the microbe similarity network and the disease similarity net- work via the known microbe-disease associations.Our method BiRWHMDA aims to predict novel microbe-disease associations by capturing CBG patterns on the global heterogeneous network.

Nevertheless due to the limited research on existing microbe-disease association data only a few methods have been developed to address the gap.In the present study we proposed a novel approach based on bi-random walk on the het- erogeneous network to predict novel microbe-disease associations.

In considering important differences RWRHMDA is based on a stochastic process that aims to predict candidate microbes for a disease by calculating the probability of the random walker reaching them  KATZHMDA is based on the KATZ measure that calculates nodes' similarity in the heterogeneous network to solve the problem of link prediction  PBHMDA is a path- based method that utilizes a special depth-first search algorithm in the heterogeneous interlinked network to infer potential microbe-disease associations .

In addition microbe and disease similarity are cal- culated based solely on known microbe-disease associations which could cause bias for microbes and diseases already extant in the database.
