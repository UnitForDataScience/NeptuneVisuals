the restriction of high-fiber food resistant starch fresh fruit coffee tea alcohol fizzy drinks and sorbitol as recommended by the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE guidelines .Indeed studies comparing the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet vs. proper dietary advice for IBS did not show a clear-cut advantage of the low-FODMAP diet a in a US trial 40-50 of patients reported adequate relief of their IBS with diarrhea symptoms with the low-FODMAP diet or a diet based on modified NICE guidelines even though the low-FODMAP diet led to significantly greater improvement in individual IBS symptoms particularly pain and bloating compared with the NICE diet  b in a Swedish study the severity of IBS symptoms was reduced in both the low-FODMAP and the conventional IBS diet groups at the end of a four-week period of treatment .Due to the lack of a biomarker of FODMAP intolerance the gold standard for proving the causal role of FODMAP as well as other food intolerancesallergies remains the double-blind placebo-controlled DBPC challenge.

The nutritional risk of the low-FODMAP diet may be higher in persons with limited access to the expensive alternative dietary items included in the low-FODMAP diet.Keywords low-FODMAP diet irritable bowel syndrome non-celiac gluten sensitivity fermentable sugars polyols nutritional riskIntroductionFODMAP Fermentable Oligo- Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols is a heterogeneous group of highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols.

Finally the exclusion of dairy products in a low-FODMAP diet may favor a vitamin D deficiency .We speculate that the nutritional risk of the low-FODMAP diet in the long term may follow an inverse socio-economic gradient since persons with economical restraints may have limited access to many of the expensive alternative dietary items included in the low-FODMAP diet e.g.

the low-FODMAP diet  there are still several open questions regarding the physiology the efficacy and the safety of this dietary treatment.In this paper the physiological clinical and nutritional issues suggesting caution in the prolonged use of the low-FODMAP diet will be summarized on the basis of the existing literature.

All of the above positive effects are obviously lost with the low-FODMAP diet.The boundaries of a low-FODMAP diet are not perfectly known.

Patients with IBSn  20a single dose of high- or low-FODMAP drinkAfter three weeks of low-FODMAP patients were randomized and double-blindly assigned to receive a supplement of either FOS FODMAP or maltodextrin placebo for the next 10 days followed by a three-week washout period before crossover1 day10 daysfructose than glucose.

Finally the long-term effects of the microbiota changes induced by the low-FODMAP diet if any remain to be determined.A low-FODMAP diet imposes an important restriction of dietary choices due to the elimination of some staple foods such as wheat derivatives lactose-containing dairy products many vegetables and pulses and several types of fruits Table .Table 2.

In recent years the low-FODMAP diet for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome IBS has gained increasing popularity.

Although the low-FODMAP diet can have a positive impact on the symptoms of IBS particularly bloating and diarrhea the quality of the evidence is lower than optimal due to frequent methodological flaws particularly lack of a proper control group andor lack of blinding.
