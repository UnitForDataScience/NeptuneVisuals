Articles reporting the therapeutic or prophylactic effect of fermented products containing probiotics on cancertumor progression or probiotics on other diseasesinfections were not considered as well as data from books theses reviews and poster abstracts from workshops or congresses.Data collectionThe following information was extracted from each study cancer type probiotic strain cellanimal model treatment and duration and results.Inhibition of gastrointestinal cancer by probioticsFew clinical studies have reported the effect of pro- biotics on alleviating symptoms and complications in patients receiving intestinal cancer treatment 20212223 and the improved immune system and intestinal mucosal barrier resulted from probiotics could be the reasons of such effects 2324.

Therefore probiotics have been suggested and reported to be effective in prevention and inhibition of colon cancer development.Effect of probiotics against gastrointestinal cancer in vitroIn the previous year different strains of probiotics were reported to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of gastric and colon cancer cells as sum- marized in Table 1 2829303132-343536 373839-424344.

With more evidence supporting the effective- ness of probiotics on cancer suppression further investigation on different cancer types and the underlying mechanisms is clearly needed.Mechanisms through which probiotics exert their anticancer functionsThere are many different mechanisms by which probiotics may suppress tumor growthcancer pro- gression for example through modulation ofintestinal microbiota degradation of carcinogenic compounds antioxidant effects as well as modu- lation of gut-associated and systemic immune responses for reviews see 34.

It has also been suggested that synbiotics combination of probiotics and prebiot- ics and combination of two or more probiotics might be more active than a single probiotic strain 4.

Hence to optimize strain selection for specific interventions and to maximize the efficacy of probiotics it is essential to understand the precise molecular mechanisms of each functional strain.Although the number of review articles on the potential role of probiotics against colon cancer has been escalated in the past 5 years 6- 111213- 18 only few of them include the probiotic effect onaSchool of Biological Sciences Faculty of Science Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building The University of Hong Kong Pokfulam Hong Kong and bInstitute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition University of Eastern Finland Kuopio FinlandCorrespondence to Hani El-Nezami 5S-13 School of Biological Scien- ces Faculty of Science Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building The University of Hong Kong Pokfulam Road Hong Kong.

The review concludes with an outlook on the exciting future possibilities and scientific chal- lenges for the use of probiotics in cancer preven- tiontreatment.METHODSSearch strategy and study selectionA comprehensive literature search in Pubmed Science direct and Google scholar databases was conducted using the following key terms 'Probiotics' AND 'Cancer' OR 'Tumor' OR 'Carcinoma' OR 'Neoplasm' to locate all relevant articles published between January 2015 and August 2016 which investigated the effect of probiotics on preventiontreatment of both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal cancers.
