most of the heat-killed bacteria cell wall extract and genomic dna of the selected strains showed inhibition toward leukemia cells 63.other cancersapart from the above-mentioned cancer types other cancer types such as cervical and lung cancer were also shown to be inhibited by probiotics treatment both in vitro and in vivo 28293031375968- 70. with more evidence supporting the effective- ness of probiotics on cancer suppression further investigation on different cancer types and the underlying mechanisms is clearly needed.mechanisms through which probiotics exert their anticancer functionsthere are many different mechanisms by which probiotics may suppress tumor growthcancer pro- gression for example through modulation ofintestinal microbiota degradation of carcinogenic compounds antioxidant effects as well as modu- lation of gut-associated and systemic immune responses for reviews see 34. among the studies that focused on protective effects of probiotics against extraintestinal cancers many of them focused on the immunomodulatory effects of pro- biotics in relation to the inhibitory effect against extraintestinal cancers.cancer-immunity cycleantitumor responses involve different components of the immune system such as natural killer cells dendritic cells macrophages and t cells 78. chen and mellman 79 reviewed how immune system can combat cancer mainly as a cancer-immunity cycle.

it has also been suggested that synbiotics combination of probiotics and prebiot- ics and combination of two or more probiotics might be more active than a single probiotic strain 4. hence to optimize strain selection for specific interventions and to maximize the efficacy of probiotics it is essential to understand the precise molecular mechanisms of each functional strain.although the number of review articles on the potential role of probiotics against colon cancer has been escalated in the past 5 years 6- 111213- 18 only few of them include the probiotic effect onaschool of biological sciences faculty of science kadoorie biological sciences building the university of hong kong pokfulam hong kong and binstitute of public health and clinical nutrition university of eastern finland kuopio finlandcorrespondence to hani el-nezami 5s-13 school of biological scien- ces faculty of science kadoorie biological sciences building the university of hong kong pokfulam road hong kong.

articles reporting the therapeutic or prophylactic effect of fermented products containing probiotics on cancertumor progression or probiotics on other diseasesinfections were not considered as well as data from books theses reviews and poster abstracts from workshops or congresses.data collectionthe following information was extracted from each study cancer type probiotic strain cellanimal model treatment and duration and results.inhibition of gastrointestinal cancer by probioticsfew clinical studies have reported the effect of pro- biotics on alleviating symptoms and complications in patients receiving intestinal cancer treatment 20212223 and the improved immune system and intestinal mucosal barrier resulted from probiotics could be the reasons of such effects 2324. yet the benefits of probiotics are not only limited to the prevention of complications of cancer therapy but they can also include the prevention and inhibition of intestinal carcinogenesis as shown in in-vitro and in-vivo studies.because of the abundance of intestinal micro- biota in colon the association between gut micro- biota and colon cancer is especially of interest.

therefore probiotics have been suggested and reported to be effective in prevention and inhibition of colon cancer development.effect of probiotics against gastrointestinal cancer in vitroin the previous year different strains of probiotics were reported to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of gastric and colon cancer cells as sum- marized in table 1 2829303132-343536 373839-424344. concerning the mechanism of action some studies reportedthatsuch suppressive effect was dependent on short chain fatty acids scfas production of probiotics 32-34. apart from scfa tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induc- ing ligand trail that induced apoptosis of tumors was also found to be upregulated by lactobacillus casei atcc 393 and the increased protein expression of trail intumors was associated withdecreasedtumor incidence in mice 35. furthermore huang et al.

wana and hani el-nezamiabintroductionprobiotics are 'live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host' 1. the popularity of probiotics has expanded exponentially recently because of their health-promoting effects and their abilities to prevent or treat different diseases including some types of cancers 23. strains of lactic acid bacteria especially lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species are frequently employed as probiotics in fermented dairy products.

the review concludes with an outlook on the exciting future possibilities and scientific chal- lenges for the use of probiotics in cancer preven- tiontreatment.methodssearch strategy and study selectiona comprehensive literature search in pubmed science direct and google scholar databases was conducted using the following key terms 'probiotics' and 'cancer' or 'tumor' or 'carcinoma' or 'neoplasm' to locate all relevant articles published between january 2015 and august 2016 which investigated the effect of probiotics on preventiontreatment of both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal cancers.

previous in-vitro studies have shown that proliferation of breast cancer cells michigan cancer foundation-7 was inhibited by different isolated probiotics strainsupernatant from probiotic cul- tures 2829303158. it was also reported that live enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus hominisisolated from breast milk as well as heat-killed cells and cytoplasmic fractions caused cytotoxicity through the induction of apoptosis and g0g1 phase cell cycle arrest 58. in addition it was reported that probiotics inhibiting growth of breast cancer cells also exhibit anti-inflammatory properties 3031 suggesting their anticancer effect through immunomodulation.
