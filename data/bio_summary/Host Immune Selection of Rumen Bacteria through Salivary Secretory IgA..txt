SIgA can inhibit pathogenic bacteria colonization by interfering with epithelial binding targeting them for removal through T-dependent mechanisms    .Secretory-IgA has been shown to coat 40-80 of small intestinal commensal bacteria in mice   24-74 of anaerobic bacteria in human feces and 20 of commensal bacteria within the rumen of calves   potentially indicating SIgA-coating of bacteria may also be fundamental to governing commensal microbiota composition    .

We hypothesized that SIgA-tagged bacteria would differ from total bacteria thus supporting a potential host-derived mechanism in commensal bacterial selection.

Rumen transplant has demonstrated that the mature rumen microbiome is resilient to exogenous bacteria   indicating strong host mechanisms work to retain specific bacteria while eliminating others.

We expected that SIgA-tagged bacteria would differ from total bacteria.

Quench buffer was then removed and beads were re-suspended in 100 uL sterile 1 PBS pH 7.4 and stored at 4C.Isolating SIgA Tagged BacteriaTo isolate SIgA-tagged bacteria from non-tagged bacteria the prepared anti-secretory IgA conjugated beads were used.

One limitation of the study is that not all samples were successfully amplified leaving n 5 for rumen sIgA-tagged bacteria and n 6 for saliva sIgA-tagged bacteria however it is expected that this challenge could be overcome with further optimization.Oral Secretion vs.

After discarding samples with below threshold quality scores and low reads per sample resulted in n 5 for rumen sIgA-tagged bacteria and n 6 for oral secretion sIgA-tagged bacteria.

When mice lacking a functional adaptive immune system are colonized with single species of bacteria they display an increased innate immune response in comparison to mice with functional IgA  .This suggests the role of IgA is to mediate immune tolerance and homeostasis allowing the host to detect new bacteria while ignoring the presence of those previously encountered  .

The fact that SIgA binds many native rumen bacteria and these 'tagged' bacteria remain detectable within the rumen may indicate salivary SIgA is acting as a selection tool for commensal colonization in a healthy state.Whole Rumen vs. Saliva SIgA-Tagged Microbial CompositionInterestingly the SIgA-tagged oral secretion microbiota more closely resembled whole rumen microbial composition vs. whole oral secretion due to enrichment and depletion of specificbacteria.

However the role salivary SIgA plays in commensal bacteria selection in ruminants remains elusive.
