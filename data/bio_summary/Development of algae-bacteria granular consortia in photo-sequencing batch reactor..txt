Chlorella and Sce- nedesmus which have been successfully and extensively used for wastewater treatment and biofuel production were selected as target algae  and mature aerobic granules were used as biological carrier material of the target algae.

Principal Coordinate Analysis PCoA was displayed by WGCNA package stat packages and ggplot2 package in R software Version 2.15.3.ResultsDevelopment process of the granular consortiaDue to the application of mature granular sludge and slow set- tling capacity of dispersed algae the volume exchange ratio of the PSBRs was set as effective control parameter in this experiment to select for algae growing attached the granules.

It indicated the lipid accumulation was more important for the biomass utiliza- tion compared with the algae abundance in the granular consortia and this result was in agreement with the review of algae for bio- diesel production .

Although the assimilation of nitrate and nitrite by the algae was usually observed in the wastewater treatment the membrane barrier and reductive power consumption existed in this process causing the ammonia nitro- gen to be the preferable as nitrogen source for the algae .

Thereby according to the algae distribu- tion in the granules in this experiment more carbon concentration would occur in the core of the granules from the PSBRs with higher algal biomass and prolonged starvation time and carbon was also the key growing factor for the denitrifying bacteria.ConclusionAerobic granules can be used as the immobilized material of algae and EPS bridge function was dominant development mech- anism of granular consortia.

The seed algae can remain dominant in the phototroph commu- nity yet the photoheterotrophs and algae would compete with the aerobic bacteria for the surface space aerobic zone of the granules.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by National Natural Science Founda- tion of China 51308523 Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Fujian 2014J01214 Science and Technology Planning Project of Xiamen City 3502Z20162001 and State Environmental Protec- tion Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control SMARC2013D010.Appendix A.

The seed algae maintained dominance in the phototroph community whereas the cyanobacteria only occupied a small proportion 5.2-6.5.

Although the bacterial communities with different operational strategies showed significant difference the dominated bacteria Comamonadaceae 18.79-36.25 in the mature granular consortia were similar.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
