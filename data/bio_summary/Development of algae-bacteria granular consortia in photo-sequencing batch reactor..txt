chlorella and sce- nedesmus which have been successfully and extensively used for wastewater treatment and biofuel production were selected as target algae  and mature aerobic granules were used as biological carrier material of the target algae.

this result indicated that except for the algae the photoheterotrophs would also com- pete with the typical aerobic bacteria in the wastewater treatment system for the surface space aerobic zone of the granular consor- tia and the higher aeration intensity could improve the competi- tion in the psbrs.the psbrs with higher hd ratio would cause more illuminated space and also showed a higher shear force under the same aera- tion rate.

comparative 16s rrna sequence analyses revealed that the two former families comprise mainly aerobic photoheterotrophs and plant-associated nitrogen- fixing aerobes  and the latter was defined as aerobic chemoautotroph which would mainly be located at the surface of aerobic granules .

rhodocyclaceae comprise mainly aerobic photo- heterotrophs and nitrogen-fixing aerobes  and flavobacteriaceae was found to be the dominant bacteria at the aerobic heterotrophic zone of the aerobic granules  .

the seed algae maintained dominance in the phototroph community whereas the cyanobacteria only occupied a small proportion 5.2-6.5. although the bacterial communities with different operational strategies showed significant difference the dominated bacteria comamonadaceae 18.79-36.25 in the mature granular consortia were similar.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionin aquatic environments algae and bacteria play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and contaminants removal by biosynthesis and corresponding author at key laboratory of urban pollutant conversion institute of urban environment chinese academy of sciences xiamen 361021 china.e-mail addresses  l. liu.biological metabolic processes.

to compare the characteristics of the algae-bacteria granular consortia in the six psbrs and the comparisons were consideredto have a statistically significant difference for p  0.05 and the cal- culation of pearson correlation coefficient r were used to test for the positive or negative correlation n  9. principal coordinate analysis pcoa was displayed by wgcna package stat packages and ggplot2 package in r software version 2.15.3.resultsdevelopment process of the granular consortiadue to the application of mature granular sludge and slow set- tling capacity of dispersed algae the volume exchange ratio of the psbrs was set as effective control parameter in this experiment to select for algae growing attached the granules.

it indicated the lipid accumulation was more important for the biomass utiliza- tion compared with the algae abundance in the granular consortia and this result was in agreement with the review of algae for bio- diesel production .

although the assimilation of nitrate and nitrite by the algae was usually observed in the wastewater treatment the membrane barrier and reductive power consumption existed in this process causing the ammonia nitro- gen to be the preferable as nitrogen source for the algae .

thereby according to the algae distribu- tion in the granules in this experiment more carbon concentration would occur in the core of the granules from the psbrs with higher algal biomass and prolonged starvation time and carbon was also the key growing factor for the denitrifying bacteria.conclusionaerobic granules can be used as the immobilized material of algae and eps bridge function was dominant development mech- anism of granular consortia.

in some recent research without inoculum addition the algae growth was also observed on the surface of aerobic granules in the photo-bioreactor by natural sunlight exposure  .

however to date there is no research aimed at culturing the granular consortia using aerobic granules and the selected algae.

on the 5th day the symbiotic growth of algae in the aerobic granules was clearly detected according to the change of total chl concen- tration and therefore the volume exchange ratio of all psbrs was subsequently increased to 60. from then on the total chl concen- tration in the granules gradually increased and the volume exchange ratio of all psbrs was set to 80 on the 20th day to fur- ther enhance the symbiotic process.

in addition an interesting inference in accordance with the nitrate assimilated mechanism by the algae was proposed by  who concluded nitrite could be generated in the process of nitrate being reduced to ammonium during chlorella cultivation in wastewater.effect of operating parametersin the aerobic granular reactor aeration rate would affect the intensity of shear force do concentration and the diffusion of the substrate thereby causing the different properties of the gran- ules.
