Assessment using questions 1-27 listed.Effects of aerobic resistance and combined training on inflammatory biomarkersFour out of the seven studies that investigated the effect of aer- obic training on resting levels of CRP reported a significant re- duction in CRP levels following a period of aerobic training.-Sensitivity analysis examining differences in the effect of aerobic training on CRP in male n 14 180 participants and female participants n 14 350 participants suggested a more consistent reduction in CRP levels in older females performing regular aerobic training for 24 weeks or more.

Five studies exam- ined the influence of aerobic training on levels of IL-6 with in- consistent results .- Three studies examined the effect of aerobic exercise AE on TNF-aand a single study examined effects on IL-1b demonstrating no significant changes after either exercise intervention small-sided games or station- ary cycling .No included studies measured the im- pact of aerobic training on resting IL-8 levels .Three articles included in this review studied the effect of RT on CRP levels with inconsistent results .In all three of these studies the intervention comprised progressive weight lifting exercise.

No studies demonstrated a significant alter- ation in IL-6 levels following RT at 8 12 or 16 weeks.Thegeneralizability of our findings in relation to RT is questionable in female populations as only a single small trial examined the effect of RT RT in women.Despite the relatively small num- ber of studies measuring changes in resting levels of TNF-a n 14 6 the review findings were consistent suggesting circulat- ing levels in healthy physically inactive populations are not subject to alteration following initiation of resistance aerobic or combined training.In the present systematic review the greatest changes in biomarkers following aerobic or RT exercises were evident in studies investigating effects in older physically inactive adultsin contrast to those addressing younger or middle- aged volunteers.We propose that the reason for these findings relates to the comparatively high levels of inflamma- tory biomarkers associated with ageing and the potential for this to be reversed with physical activity.Key findings from a recent meta-analysis suggest that a greater reduction in circu- lating pro-inflammatory biomarkers in disease populations is witnessed in those with significant weight and adipose tissue reduction post-exercise intervention.

For example resistance training RT provides differential immunological and metabolic effects compared with traditional cardiorespiratory aerobic ex- ercise.-The intent here is a systematic review of the impact of aerobic resistance and combined aerobic plus resistance exercise training on resting inflammatory biomarkers in non- disease physically inactive individuals.

Furthermore compliance with the randomized interventions is also variable and in many instances was not described in the included studies.Results outlining the effects of aerobic training on baselineresting-state IL-6 levels were also inconsistent with some but not all studies indicating a reduction in baseline IL-6 levels post-aerobic training.The investigation by Mendham et al.

To date systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not investigated the effects of exercise on pro-inflammatory biomarker levels in 'healthy' physically inactive subjects and have predominantly focused on disease populations in which levels of these biomarkers are known to be elevated.Similarly the impact of alternative modes of exercise training on inflammatory biomarker levels has received relatively little attention.

The effects of aerobic and resistance training RT on inflammatory bio- marker profiles in non-disease physically inactive individuals are unknown.Methods A systematic review of randomized controlled trials measuring the effect of aerobic and resistance exercise on pro-inflammatory biomarkers in healthy inactive adult populations was conducted.

Levels of TNF-a did not differ following 8 or 12 weeks of progressive RT.Likewise there was no effect on IL-1b levels following 12 weeks of progressive RT.A single study examining the effects of combined aerobic and RT did notdemonstrate any reduction in CRP IL-6 or TNF-a after 16-weeks .DiscussionExercise offers a therapeutic option for the treatment and pre- vention of many conditions including the metabolic degenera- tive and inflammatory disorders type 2 diabetes mellitus non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseand mild cognitive impair- ment.Whether initiation of exercise in non-disease inactive populations can ameliorate circulating inflammatory profiles as it can in disease populations remains unclear.

indicates that progressive aerobic training of moderate intensity can reduce IL-6 levels although it may require a longer duration of training 24 weeks.

did not demonstrate a significant re- duction in IL-6 levels after 6 or 12 months of aerobic training.
