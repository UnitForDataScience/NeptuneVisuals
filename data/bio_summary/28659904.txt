V. alginolyticus Bu1537 was isolated starting with sponge material.An interesting outcome of this study is that a large portion of bacteria with antimicrobial activity was isolated from egg masses.

Investigation of the interrelation between associated bacteria and desired protection of egg masses opens up a topic for future research.To tackle the threat by antibiotic-resistant bacteria new treatment options and new bioactive compounds must be identified.

To test the potential of the associated bacteria the latter were isolated from their hosts brought into culture and extracts were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activities.

The isolated bacteria were tested for the presence of polyketide synthases PKSs and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases NRPSs coding genes since a majority of pharmaceutical interesting compounds is produced by these biosynthetic pathways.

However the strain showing activity against the Gram-negative EHEC strain was a Marinomonas species.Phylogenetic AnalysisFor all isolated axenic bacteria the 16S rDNA gene was amplified using rD1 and fD1 primers designed for the specific and long range amplification of eubacterial 16S rDNA.

Bu1544 yielded 3 distinct KS fragments.DISCUSSIONThe isolation of Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas strains from marine sea slugs seemed likely since these bacteria are known as abundant species in the marine habitat and many strains were already isolated by using commercially available complex media with a concentration of ions mimicking seawater.

Many natural products originally isolated from sponges can be attributed to bacteria as the real producers .

In this context the presence of PKS- and NRPS-coding sequences in the isolated strains provides further evidence that biosynthesis of specialized metabolites with interesting biological activities is encoded in these bacteria.

The highest proportion of strains 20 each was isolated from the egg masses Hesa15Bu1 and Hesa15Bu2 of H. sanguineus whereby only 2 equates to 1 strain were isolated from the processed sponge sample.

Thereby the original source of these natural products varies it might be the food source de novo synthesis from the sea slug or biosynthesis by associated bacteria.
