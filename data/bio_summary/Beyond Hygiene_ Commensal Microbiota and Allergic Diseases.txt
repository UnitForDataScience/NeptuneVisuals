upon the re-exposure of allergen allergen-bound iges result in degranulation of mast cells and basophils to release many mediators such as histamine and platelet-activating factor paf that induce symptoms of allergic diseases 9. the prevalence of allergic diseases is relatively low in developing or undeveloped country and allergic patients tend to have low th1 but elevated th2 immune response 10. hence 'hygiene hypothesis' has been introduced to propose that the imbalance towards th2 responses due to reduced infectious burdens and subsequent reduction of th1 responses causes allergic diseases 11.however many allergic diseases occur in the mucosal tissues harboring numerous species of the commensal microbiota and are closely associated with the compo- sitional changes of the commensal microbiota at affected mucosal tissues or in the intestine suggesting that commensal microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases.

such colonic peripheral treg ptreg cells were proposed tosuppress allergen-specific ige responses and subsequently prevent allergen-induced diarrhea 7071. clostridium species can contribute to the generation of colonic ptreg cells by inducing transforming growth factor-b tgf-b from intestinal epithelial cells iecs 70 or dendritic cells 72.more importantly clostridium species can induce the production of scfas such as acetate butyrate and propionate by degrading dietary fibers such as starch and cellulose 73. scfas produced by intestinal microbes can enhance the generation of colonic ptreg cells and stabilize post-translational acetylation of foxp3 through the inhibition of histone deacetylase by butyrate resulting in increased stability and suppressive functions of treg cells 7475. although it is unclear whether clostridium- induced ptregs in the colon directly prevent allergic responses to dietary antigens a subset of ptreg cells induced by intestinal microbiota is also present in the small intestine.

than healthy control 68. a recent study based on metagenomic analysis of 16s rrna sequences reported that cma infants had more diverse microbiota than control group and had a significant reduction in bifidobacterium whereas butyrate-producing microbes such as ruminococcus and faecalibacterium were enri- ched 69. such butyrate-producing microbes might be beneficial to achieve tolerance to food allergens or amelio- rate the symptoms of food allergy since outgrowing infants from cma by the treatment of hydrolyzed casein formula supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had higher fecal butyrate concentrations than allergic infants.despite the ill-defined relationships between the intestinal microbiota and food allergy in human studies experimental ige-mediated food allergy animal models could help to elucidate the role of intestinal microbiota on the pathogenesis of food allergy and reveal several mechanistic insights.induction of intestinal peripheral treg cellscolonization of gf mice with clostridium species can induce de novo differentiation of treg cells in the laminar propria lp of colon but not in the small intestine.

here we review current findings on the relationship between commensal microbiota and allergic diseases and discuss the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of allergic responses by commensal microbiota.immune network 201717148-59keywords commensal microbiota food allergy asthma atopic dermatitisintroductionmetazoans have co-evolved with microorganisms by establishing a trans-kingdom symbiotic relationship that influences many physiological functions of the host including nutrient absorption resistance to pathogenic infection immune defense and tissue repair 1. microbial inhabitants collectively called as commensal microbiota see box 1 2 are estimated to outnumber our host cells3 and colonize nearly all the mucosal surfaces including respiratory tracts skin vagina and gastrointestinal tracts 4. although the importance of commensal microbiota in the development of host immune system had long been predicted 5 and germ-free gf mice an experimental model critical for studying host-microbiota interaction had been developed in 1959 6 the details of how commensal microbiota influences many of the host's physiological functions is beginning to be realized onlybox 1. classification of bacterial inhabitantsreceived on november 27 2016. revised on january 23 2017. accepted on january 31 2017.this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license i orglicensesby-nc4.0 which permits unrestricted non-commercial use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.corresponding author.

a recent prospectivestudy showed that infants with lower abundance of bifidobacterium akkermansia and faecalibacterium incurred a higher relative risk of asthma by promoting adaptive immune dysfunctions featured by increased proportion of il-4 t 2 cells and reduced percentage of cd25 foxp3 regulatory cd4 t treg cells 57. another study also showed that a higher risk of asthma is associated with the lower abundance of genera such as faecalibacterium lachnospira veillonella and rothia in infants despite of similar abundance of dominant bifidobacterium 58. furthermore supplementing with microbes abundant in healthy controls into gf mice previously colonized with fecal microbiota from infants of high risk for asthma reduced severity of allergic airway inflammation 58. it was also reported that abundance of bifidobacterium is decreased in adult asthma patients 59. it seems that faecalibacterium especially subspecies producing scfas and bifidobacterium provides benefi- cial effect for preventing asthma.in line with human studies animal model deficient of intestinal microbiota like gf mice 60 or mice with altered intestinal microbiota by feeding diet containing less dietary fiber contents 6162 could exacerbate allergic airway inflammation.food allergy and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiotafood allergies hypersensitivity responses to dietary antigens have been increased especially in developed or westernized countries over recent decades 63 and have become major health issues.

accordingly alteration of commensal microbiota by genetic and environmental factors such as the mode of delivery natural vs. surgical dietary intervention during ontogeny breast- vs. formula- feeding westernized diet high in fat and low in fiber antibiotics and indoor environment are all associated with the incidence of allergic diseases 12-15. in this review we summarize current understanding of the relationship between commensal microbiota and allergy and revise 'hygiene hypothesis' by incorporating commensal microbiota as a pivotal contributing factor for allergic diseases.skin and airway allergic diseases and dysbiosis of microbiotawith recent advances in next generation sequencing tech- nologies metagenomic analyses including a milestone study by the human microbiome project consortium have revealed that distinct communities of commensal microbiota exist at different mucosal tissues or even at different sites of same tissue depending on the environ- mental features 416 fig.

furthermore individual species of intestinal microbiota differs its capacity to generate rorgt ptreg cells 91 which can possibly control mucosal th2 responses 76. under normal conditions small intestinal th2 cells are much lower than th1 cells expressing tbet and ifn-g even in gf condition 87. however the role of dietary antigens- or intestinal microbiota-induced ptreg cells on the control of intestinal th2 cells against food antigens still remains elusive.epithelial barrier functions are important for preventing allergic diseases.

certain species of intestinal microbiota such as bifidobacterium can induce apoptosis of mast cells thus preventing food allergy.regulation of intestinal permeability to food allergensin addition to the capacity of intestinal microbiota to pro- mote intestinal ptreg cells clostridium species can lead to the production of il-22 from rorgt type 3 innate lymphoid cells ilc3s and cd4 t cells in colonic lp.

additionally comparative metagenomics during the onset of allergic disease can reveal inter-relationships among microbiota at different anatomic sites.as intestinal microbiota influences the pathogenesis ofmost allergic diseases studies on mutualistic interactions between host immune system and intestinal microbiota could reveal important regulatory mechanisms such as scfas which are an important links between host immune system diet and intestinal microbiota.

s. aureus is a part of normal microbiota as a pathobiont in nasal passages 20 of individuals are estimated to be long-term carriers and 60 are intermittent carriers 20. metagenomic analyses of skin microbiota in ad patients have revealed that s. aureus become predominant in about 90 of ad patients resulting in a dramatic decrease of skin microbiota diversity 21. it was shown that staphylococcal products such as staphylococcal a-hemolysin 22 and extracellular vesicles form s. aureus can modulate skin barrier functions and induce atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation in animal models 22-27. staphylococcal enterotoxins acting as super-antigens can induce allergic skin inflammation by inducing strong t cell activation 28. staphlylococcal d-toxin can also induce allergic skin disease by activating mast cells 29.these studies suggest that dysbiosis caused by predomi- nant colonization of s. aureus are important exacerbatingfactor for the pathogenesis of ad.

2 83.due to the absence of commensal microbiota gf mice or antibiotics-treated mice are skewed towards th2 cells and possess high level of igg1 and ige in serum 84. oral sensitization of peanut allergen with cholera toxin can lead to increased peanut-specific ige responses in gf mice relative to specific pathogen-free spf mice 79. underlying mechanisms leading to skewed th2 responses and hyper-ige syndrome in gf mice remain elusive however the involvement of intestinal microbiota is evident since colonization of diverse intestinal microbiota specifically at early life has been demonstrated to prevent the generation of ige responses 85. role of dietary antigens on the generation of ige responses in gf mice isstill controversial but dietary antigens appear to contribute to hyper-ige syndrome in gf mice since antigen-free mice gf mice raised in a condition devoid of dietary antigens possess much reduced level of ige relative to gf mice unpublished data.intestinal immune system keeping allergic responses under controlso far we discussed evidence suggesting that intestinal microbial dysbiosis is tightly associated with various types of allergic diseases.

both dietary antigens- and intestinal microbiota-induced ptreg cells nrp-1lo rorgt- and nrp- 1lo rorgt respectively are present in the small intestine 7687. prodigious mucosal immunity against newly administrated oral antigens could be generated in antigen- free mice depleted of both dietary antigens- and intestinal microbiota-induced ptreg cells suggesting that mucosal ptreg cells can further condition mucosal environment to be more tolerogenic and promote oral tolerance 87.incidence of food allergy as well as other allergic diseases is higher in infants than adults despite of the dominance of beneficial bifidobacterium species 88. intestinal microbiota in infants are less diverse due to the limited energy source in breast- and formula-milk 89 and vulnerable to exogenous perturbations such as exposure to antibiotics.

while it is controversial whether other allergic diseases can be outgrown most children suffering from food allergy can outgrow their allergies by the unknown mechanisms 90. it is possible that the exposure to diverse dietary antigens and the surge of intestinal micro- biota caused by the change of diets can induce ptreg cells in the small intestine that can subsequently promote tolerogenic intestinal environment and facilitate tolerance to food allergens.interestingly intestinal microbiota-induced nrp-1lororgt ptreg cells in the small intestine can express suppressive mediators such as il-10 and ctla4 at higher levels compared to nrp-1hi ttreg cells or dietary antigens- induced nrp-1lo rorgt- ptreg cells unpublished data.
