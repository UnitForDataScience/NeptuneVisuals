Age matched mice were randomly divided into the following eight experimental groups n  8 i control Ctrl group fed with a normal diet ND ii high-fat diet fed group HFD iii HFD  10 KM WG HFD-10WG iv HFD  10 KM BR HFD-10BR v HFD  20 KM WG HFD-20WG vi HFD  20 KM BRHFD-20BR vii a per se group fed with ND  20 WG ND-20WG and viii a per se group fed ND  20 BR ND-20BR.

IL-6 and LPS levels were low in the mice fed with KM-WG and BR at both the doses relative to HFD fed mice suggesting physiological improvement through an enhanced gut barrier function as a result of the beneficial modulation of gut bacteria.252930 The higher IL-6 level has been reported in obese subjects relative to their lean counterparts.31 The role of IL-6 in obesity is ambiguous as some studies suggest elevated IL-6 imparts anti-inflammatory activity while others reported that a low IL-6 level is beneficial in counteracting obesity.32 Overall this study shows that kodo millet supplementation could counteract HFD induced pro- inflammatory stress.HFD feeding caused a reduction in beneficial gut bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and A. muciniphila as reported by others.10 As a result LPS might have translocated from the intestine due to the dampened intestinal barrier function.

ND-WG and ND-BR fed mice showed a reduction in LDL-c while showing an increase in HDL-c relative to ND fed mice whereas TAG TC VLDL-c and NEFA remained the same as that of ND fed mice.

However in OGTT HFD fed mice showed higher AUC than ND fed mice.

HFD-BR fed mice at 10 and 20 doses and HFD-20WG showed decreased AUC in OGTT relative to HFD fed mice Fig.

3b c and e.SCFA analysisThe total SCFA acetate propionate and butyrate levels in the cecal content were reduced in HFD fed mice relative to ND fed mice Fig.

As a result a lower accumulation of triglycerols in the liver was observed in mice fed with a high dose of KM-WG and both doses of KM-BR relative to HFD alone fed mice.

HFD 4.66 kcal g-1 HFD  10 WG 4.65 kcal g-1 HFD  20 WG 4.63 kcal g-1 HFD-10 BR 4.64 kcal g-1 and HFD-20 BR4.63 kcal g-1.

The total energy content of whole grain and bran per 100 g was similar as shown in Table 1.Table 1 Proximate nutritional composition of kodo milletBody weight gain and OGTTHFD fed mice showed a higher body weight gain at the end of16 weeks relative to ND fed mice Table 2.

The TAG levels of ND-20WG and BR fed mice were similar to ND fed mice Fig.
