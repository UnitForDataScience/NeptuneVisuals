age matched mice were randomly divided into the following eight experimental groups n  8 i control ctrl group fed with a normal diet nd ii high-fat diet fed group hfd iii hfd  10 km wg hfd-10wg iv hfd  10 km br hfd-10br v hfd  20 km wg hfd-20wg vi hfd  20 km brhfd-20br vii a per se group fed with nd  20 wg nd-20wg and viii a per se group fed nd  20 br nd-20br.

the total energy content of whole grain and bran per 100 g was similar as shown in table 1.table 1 proximate nutritional composition of kodo milletbody weight gain and ogtthfd fed mice showed a higher body weight gain at the end of16 weeks relative to nd fed mice table 2. hfd-wg and hfd-br supplementation at 10 and 20 doses did not prevent body weight gain table 2. the average food intake was the same among all the experimental groups table 2. fasting blood glucose levels were similar in all the diet groups table 2. however in ogtt hfd fed mice showed higher auc than nd fed mice.

il-6 and lps levels were low in the mice fed with km-wg and br at both the doses relative to hfd fed mice suggesting physiological improvement through an enhanced gut barrier function as a result of the beneficial modulation of gut bacteria.252930 the higher il-6 level has been reported in obese subjects relative to their lean counterparts.31 the role of il-6 in obesity is ambiguous as some studies suggest elevated il-6 imparts anti-inflammatory activity while others reported that a low il-6 level is beneficial in counteracting obesity.32 overall this study shows that kodo millet supplementation could counteract hfd induced pro- inflammatory stress.hfd feeding caused a reduction in beneficial gut bacteria such as bifidobacteria and a. muciniphila as reported by others.10 as a result lps might have translocated from the intestine due to the dampened intestinal barrier function.

nd-wg and nd-br fed mice showed a reduction in ldl-c while showing an increase in hdl-c relative to nd fed mice whereas tag tc vldl-c and nefa remained the same as that of nd fed mice.

hfd-br fed mice at 10 and 20 doses and hfd-20wg showed decreased auc in ogtt relative to hfd fed mice fig.

3b c and e.scfa analysisthe total scfa acetate propionate and butyrate levels in the cecal content were reduced in hfd fed mice relative to nd fed mice fig.

as a result a lower accumulation of triglycerols in the liver was observed in mice fed with a high dose of km-wg and both doses of km-br relative to hfd alone fed mice.

hfd 4.66 kcal g-1 hfd  10 wg 4.65 kcal g-1 hfd  20 wg 4.63 kcal g-1 hfd-10 br 4.64 kcal g-1 and hfd-20 br4.63 kcal g-1.

the tag levels of nd-20wg and br fed mice were similar to nd fed mice fig.

glucose clearance was remarkably quick at the 15 min time point for hfd-10wg and overall auc wasmuch reduced in hfd-10br  hfd-20br relative to hfd fed mice fig.

hepatic triacylglycerols tags were increased in hfd mice while their levels were decreased in hfd-wg and hfd-br fed mice at both doses with a better normalization of tags at a higher 20 dose fig.

1c.serum lipid parameters insulin resistin and leptin levelshfd-fed mice had higher serum tag tc hdl-c ldl-c vldl-c and nefa levels than nd-fed mice table 2. hfd-wg and hfd-br at 10 and 20 doses decreased their levels rela- tive to hfd fed mice.

hfd-br at 10 and 20 doses reduced il-6 to 35.5 28.2 pg ml-1 and lps to 1.3  0.65 ng ml-1 relative to hfd alone fed mice.

2c and d. there was no change in tnfa levels among the experimental groups data not shown.gene expression analysis in liver and vwatthe hepatic acc gene expression decreased upon hfd sup- plementation relative to nd fed mice fig.

supplementation with hfd-wg at 10 and 20 levels pro- moted its expression whereas hfd-br feeding did not show an increase relative to hfd alone fed mice fig.
