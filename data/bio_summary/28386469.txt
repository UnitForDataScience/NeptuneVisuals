Recently we cultured P. acnes isolates belonging to the otherwise uncommon type III from lesions of PMH patients and sequenced their genomes 23 and a very recent study revealed an abundance of P. acnes type III in bacterial cultures from lesional skin in 14 of 34 PMH patients 24.In the present study the type distribution of the entire population of P. acnes in affected and unaffected skin ar- eas of PMH patients including samples after treatment and matching control samples was determined using a culture-independent next-generation sequencing NGS- based SLST approach.

5b.Existence of a specific type III linage associated with PMH lesionsSince type III strains were also detected albeit fewer in healthy samples in particular on the lower back skin we wanted to investigate if PMH-associated type III strains belong to a specific lineage that is different from health- associated type III strains.

Strikingly successful PMH treatment is able to alter the composition of the P. acnes population by substantially diminish- ing the proportion of P. acnes type III.Our study suggests that P. acnes type III may play a role in the formation of PMH.

Comprehensive comparison of type III genomes to P. acnes genomes of other subtypes has identified several genomic regions specific to type III genomes encoding functions such as type II secretion system ABC transporter inosi- tol transportmodification gyrase integrase transposase oligopeptide transport and processing of sugarsamino ac- ids 24 33 34.

The analyses showed that PMH-associated type III P. acnes belong pre- dominantly to the STs L1 56 and L6 25 the latter ST was detected at lower rates among health-associated type III P. acnes 9 Fig.

The dominating type of the upper back and the abdomen was type IA1 44.7 and 40.6 respectively.PMH treatment alters the P. acnes population and diminishes the proportion of type III strainsNext we wanted to investigate how the treatment of PMH with a combination of lymecycline and BPO might alterFig.

As in other studies no Malassezia fungus was detected and only few bacteria of other species mainly Staphylo- coccus epidermidis were found.Our study revealed a high proportion 74 of P. acnes type III in lesional skin and also a relatively high propor- tion 53 of type III isolates in adjacent nonlesional skin of the patients.

Moreover an indication that subtype III is involved in the PMH disease pathogenesis was re- vealed by the comparison of patient samples before and after treatment therapy with lymecycline and BPO both highly active against P. acnes led to a diminished propor- tion of type III which was paralleled by the disappearance of clinical PMH lesions.The applied NGS-based SLST approach gave an aver- age of 7911 reads per sample with 97 of reads assigned to known P. acnes STs.

Instead control samples containeda higher proportion of type IA1 STs A to E strains 56.8 and type II ST K strains 22.3 while these were found in much lower proportions in PMH lesions type IA1 12.8 and type II 5.6.

Thedominant P. acnes type on the lower back skin of healthy controls was type II 33.5 a type that was rarely de- tected on the upper back 4.0.
