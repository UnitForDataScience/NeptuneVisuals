Although sensitization has a positive correlation with asthma development studies from European birth cohorts have established that exposure to HDM alone is not sufficient to incur an increased risk of asthmaindicating that IgE sensitization is the bridge between allergen exposure and asthma development however innate immune responses triggered by HDM have also been implicated in allergic disease pathogenesis.Tovey et al suggest a nonlinear dose-response relationship between HDM exposure and development of allergic disease with exposure to both very low and very high levels of allergen correlating with decreased risk of sensitization and asthma and exposure to intermediate levels of allergen correlating with increased risk.

Similarly in a case-control study of infants hospitalized with RSV versus healthy control subjects followed to age 18 years a significantly higher prevalence of current asthma was seen in the RSV group compared with the control group RSV was the major risk factor in subsequent asthma development odds ratio 7.2 95 CI 2.1-23.9.Others have found that HRV infection might be equally or more important for development of asthma than RSV.

No associations between asthma and early exposures to cat and dog allergens were found in 17 and 13 birth cohorts included in a systematic review respectively.Finally pooled analysis of data from 11 European birth cohorts found no effect of early pet ownership on asthma development or allergic rhinitis when examining mutually exclusive pet ownership categories cat only dog only cat and dog only bird only or rodent only.Overall the cumulative evidence suggests no increase in risk of allergic disease from pet allergen exposure with a possible decreased risk of asthma associated with cat allergen exposure in one study.

In North American cohorts diesel exhaust particle exposure in the first year of life was associ- ated with greater aeroallergen sensitization in early childhood than in children with low exposure.Children who were aeroallergen sensitized and had high exposure to TRAP dur- ing the first year of life had an almost 3-fold higher risk of asthma development compared with children who were not sensitized to allergensnor did sensitization alone increase the risk of asthma in children exposed to low levels of TRAP suggesting that the combination of early-life pollutant exposure and allergic sensitization contributes to asthma development.Exposure to increased levels of TRAP during infancy has also been associated with atopy to foods and perennial aeroallergens at age 1 year.These effects might extend to the prenatal period.

Asthma development by school age was 4 times greater in wheezing infants with HRV infection compared with the incidence in infants with other viruses in one study.In the Childhood Origins of Asthma COAST birth cohort a group at high risk for devel- opment of asthma HRV-induced wheezing in infancy was the strongest predictor of persistent wheezing at age 3 years and diag- nosis of asthma at age 6 years.Prevention of viral infection in early life has been proposed as a strategy for primary prevention of asthma but thus far this has not been possible given the difficulties with synthesizing an effective vaccine against HRV.

Increased forkhead box P3 methylation from salivary DNA was associated with increased pollutant exposure during childhood affecting both increased risk of asthma diagnosis at age 7 yearsand asthma severity.Although pollutant-induced epigenetic modifications are not restricted to Treg cell development and function their dysregulation has potential to affect the development of allergic disease over the lifespan.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe effect of microbial allergen and air pollutant expo- sures has been artificially subdivided in this review in reality these exposures and many others interact simultaneously withFIG 2.

Additionally high exposure to NO2 during the first year of life was associated with increased odds of having significantly decreased FEV1 and forced vital capacity values.Although many studies have demonstrated an association between early-life exposure to pollutants and asthma or persistent wheezingconflicting evidence recently emerged from a cross-sectional examination of 5 European birth cohorts in which no associations were found between air pollutant exposure and asthma prevalence.To further examine these discrepancies a recent longitudinal examination using birth cohort data from more than 14000 children from The Netherlands Germany and Sweden evaluated the relationship of annual air pollution concentrations from birth through age 14-16 years with asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis incidence and prevalence.This study using both meta-analyses and pooled analyses found that increasing exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 at the birth address was associated with increased asthma incidence through adolescence.

Evidence for cockroach exposure as a risk factor for persistent wheeze and asthma was provided by an evaluation of 222 siblings of the above infants with those exposed to higher concentrationsof allergen having the greatest risk.Data from the same Boston cohort also illustrated an association between early mouse allergen exposure and early wheeze and a nonstatistically significant trend toward predicting asthma allergic rhinitis and AD at 7 years of age.In a similar prospective study of infants followed for 3 years Donohue et alnot only found a significant effect of mouse and cockroach sensitization on the prevalence of AD allergic rhinitis and asthma but also demonstrated a dose-response relationship between higher cockroach or mouse-specific IgE levels and increased prevalence of allergic disease.

In samples taken from 831 homes across the United States at least 6 detectable allergens were found in more than 50 of homes.Allergens from house dust mite HDM furred pets cats and dogs mice cockroaches and fungi comprise the most common indoor allergens implicated in patients with atopic disease.The strong relationship between allergic sensitization and development of allergic rhinitis and asthma has been well documented.Recently Rubner et al demonstrated that aeroallergen sensitization before the age of 5 years significantly increased the risk of asthma with persistence into adolescence.

The Asthma Coalition on Community Environment and Social Stress project an urban pregnancy cohort found that prenatal exposures to black carbon and PM were associated with a significant risk of wheezing by age 2 years.Moreover exposure to increased PM2.5 levels during the second trimester of pregnancy was significantly associated with asthma at age 6 years particularly in boys.Postnatal exposure to TRAP particularly during the first years of life is also an important determinant of lung function and asthma development.
