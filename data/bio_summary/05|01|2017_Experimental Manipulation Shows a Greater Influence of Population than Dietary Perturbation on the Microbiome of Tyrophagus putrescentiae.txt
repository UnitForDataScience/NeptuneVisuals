Lab laboratory population Phil Phillips population Kop Koppert population P1 perturbation 1 P2 perturbation 2.were exceptions in the dog population perturbation 1 dry dog food kernel diet switched to oilseed rape diet DDFdOSRd and Phillips population perturbation 1 SPMdDDFd.

In contrast Cardinium and Solitalea-like bacteria were not influenced by perturba- tion in the above populations apart from Solitalea-like bacteria in the Koppert population .Based on the Illumina data set the laboratory population contained 13 core OTUs and perturbation resulted in the addition of three OTUs an OTU of Lactobacillus amylovorus OTU 37 for perturbation 1 and two OTUs of Virgibacillus OTUs 21 and 34 for perturbation 2.

Therefore triplots were constructed with these variables population perturbation and lipids for the Illumina data set and population perturbation and glycogen status for the qPCR data set  and .

Additionally the analysis of variance ANOVA-like permutation test applied to the terms in the RDA model confirmed the significant effects of population lipid status and perturbation and the interaction between population and perturbation all with P  0.01 on the OTU distribution.

The combination of the forward selection of the environmental variables with the VIF computation and the ANOVA-like permutation tests applied to the individual terms confirmed the inclusion of all populations glycogen content perturbation 2 and the interaction between population and perturbation in general for all cases P  0.001.

We observed that diet perturbation was associated with a rapid change in T. putrescentiae population growth as previously reported  and we confirmed the strong effect of perturbation on both population growth and nutrient status.

Four T. putrescentiae populations referred to as dog Koppert laboratory and Phillips underwent a perturbation i.e.

The effect of diet perturbation on the variability of the microbiome composition and population growth was lower than the effect induced by mite population.

In contrast the diet perturbation showed a greater effect on nutritional status of mites than the mite population.

The T. putrescentiae microbiome is dynamic and varies based on both the mite population and perturbation however the mites remain characterized by robust bacterial communities.
