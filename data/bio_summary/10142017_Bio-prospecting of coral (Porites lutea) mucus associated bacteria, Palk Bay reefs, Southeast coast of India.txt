A detailed understanding of a healthy coral associated bacterial community is imperative if we need to understand their roles in the coral hol- obiont and coral disease ecology.Antagonistic activity of CMAB against bacterial pathogensRecently it has been proved by many studies that the bacterial- host symbiotic association was responsible for the production ofFig.

However they are expected to be important for the coral host's physiology in aiding biogeo- chemical cycling and pathogen resistance .0882-4010c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.To date coral reef researchers are probing on the wonders of why corals are feeding these hordes.

.Sample collectionThe mucus sample was collected using sterile syringe from the predominant massive solitary scleractinian coral P. lutea from Mandapam 9o 170 28.300 N 79o 090 72.100 E 9o 170 28.300 N 79o 09072.100 E Palk Bay coral reefs  Southeast coast of India into asterile falcon tube according to the method of Ravindran et al.

Studies focusing on the influence spatial and temporal variations of physicochemical parameters in the coral reef environment are progressing all over the world to understand the functioning of coral environment e. In the present study area the physi-cochemical parameters such as pH salinity AT and SST were 8.2 330 31 and 27 oC respectively during the sampling time.

In general the density of microbial populations in the coral surface mucus layer was approximately 10 times higher than those in the overlying water column  since coral surface mucus layer is more nutritious than the surrounding seawater.

The bacterial density in coral mucus and seawater samples were in congruence with the earlier reports from coral species of Indian waters and Porites sp.

Bio-prospecting the coral mucus revealed the existence of 10.42 antagonistic bacteria against the tested bacterial pathogens.

The privileged coral mucus associated bacterial CMAB sol-vent extracts inhibited the bacterial pathogens at 100 mgml MIC and ceased the growth at 200 mgmlMBC.
