We also validated our results in a French population.RESULTSThe CRC prediction performance based on fecal microbiome varied among different classifiers in the Chinese populationTo systematically assess the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms in the realm of CRC detection based on fecal microbiome we first imported the OTUs dataset in the species rank on the study population A Table 1 for patient data into the WEKA software.

A The testperformance of different classifiers using fecal microbiome combined with FOBT on study population A was displayed with AUC.B The test performance of different models using fecal microbiome combined with FOBT on study population B was displayed using AUC.

Hence Bayes Net algorithm outperformed all other classifiers and should be prioritized.It is worth noting that Simple Logistic and LMT algorithm two algorithms reached the highest test performance in population A only displayed limited performance of 0.714 AUC and 0.762 AUC in population B respectively Figure 1D indicating the performance of different prediction models may varyTable 1 Summary of study population A and Bconsiderably between populationsraces.

B The test performance of different models using fecal microbiome on study population B was displayed using AUC.C ROC curves show the prediction ability of the Bayes Net and Random Forest models on study population A and B respectively.

We also listed the overall summary of performance included TPR FPR Precision Recall F measure and MCC for these four algorithms to better evaluate them Table 2.Figure 1 The CRC prediction performance based on fecal microbiome varied among different classifiers and populations.

To assess whether FOBT could help improve the test performance of fecal microbiome we combined FOBT and fecal microbiome information.

As the Bayes Net and Random Forest model also maintained high performance of 0.93 AUC and 0.94 AUC on study population A we speculated these two models were better models using fecal microbiome to predict CRC regardless of geographical or cultural disparity or technical variations.

A The test performance of different models using fecal microbiome on study population A was displayed using area under roc curve AUC.

C and D ROC curves show the test performance of the Bayes Net and Random Forest models using fecal microbiome in combination with FOBT on study population A and B respectively.

An independent data and safety committee monitored the trial and reviewed the results.Acquisition of published fecal microbiome dataIn parallel another fecal microbiome dataset 20 was used as study population B to validate our results Table 1.
