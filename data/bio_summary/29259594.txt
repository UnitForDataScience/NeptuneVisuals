the average microbial reductions on red bayberry were 0.68 log cfug for aerobicbacteria 0.13 log cfug for e. coli 0.39 log cfug for mold and0.30 log cfug for yeast .

moreover la produced the largest reductions in e. coli o157h7 on red bayberry 4.31 log cfug and s. typhimurium on strawberry 6.95 log cfug among all the sanitizing treatments in this study .

the average microbial reductions on strawberry were 2.14 log cfug for aerobic bacteria 0.40 log cfug for e. coli 1.33 log cfug for mold and 1.27 log cfug for yeast .

the average microbial reductions on cherry tomato were 2.63 log cfug for aerobic bacteria 1.53 log cfug for e. coli 1.55 log cfug for mold and 2.04 log cfug for yeast .

however yeast on strawberry along with yeast and mold on red bayberry were not significantly removed by sanitizing with sh p  0.05.sanitizing with sc resulted in significant reductions in aerobic bacteria e. coli o157h7 yeast and s. typhimurium on strawberry  significant reductions in all microbiota and pathogens on cherry tomato  and significant reductions in e. coli o157h7 on red bayberry .

moreover asc also produced the greatest reductions in aerobic bacteria 4.01 log cfug on strawberry and yeast 3.04 log cfug and mold 1.52 log cfug on cherry tomato .

the reductions in microbiota and pathogens resulting from tw-10 treatment were lower than 1.5 0.15-1.44 log cfug consistent with the results of  0.7 log cfug  0.77 log cfug and others    .

for example 0.02 sh reduced microbiota and pathogens by 1.0-1.3 log cfug on fresh- cut cilantro reduced pathogens by 1.0-1.5 log cfug on fresh spinach leaves and reduced pathogens by approximately 0.5-1.0 log cfug on fresh-cut apple      .

previous studies reported that treatment with 2 la reduced e. coli o157h7 by 1.74 log cfug and s. typhimurium by 1.73 log cfug on fresh organic lettuce  .

la was the only organic acid effective at reducing yeast and no tested organic acid effectively reduced mold on red bayberry .with the exceptions of mold on red bayberry and e. coli o157h7 on strawberry la produced the largest reductions in microbiota and pathogens among the three organic acids.

asc was the only sanitizer that significantly reduced mold on red bayberry and lactic acid was the only organic acid sanitizer that effectively reduced yeast on red bayberry.

the sanitization of red bayberry with asc solution is made difficult by the rough surface of red bayberry fruit.

in this study the ability of asc to reduce aerobic bacteria e. coli o157h7 and yeast on red bayberry was similar to that of la however only asc significantly reduced the mold population.

in general 0.1 asc and 2 la were the most effective treatments for the three types of produce in this study and treatment with 0.1 asc was optimal because of the shorter sanitizing time and lower sc content.table 2  the largest reductions log cfug and corresponding sanitizing methods for different microbespathogens on fresh strawberry cherry tomato and red bayberry.sanitizer typefresh produceaerobic bacteriae.

for fresh-cut cilantro treatment with 0.025 and 0.05asc reduced microbial populations by approximately 2 log cfug while the reduction achieved by 0.1 asc was more than 3 log cfug  .
