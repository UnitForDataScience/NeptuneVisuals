The average microbial reductions on red bayberry were 0.68 log cfug for aerobicbacteria 0.13 log cfug for E. coli 0.39 log cfug for mold and0.30 log cfug for yeast .

However yeast on strawberry along with yeast and mold on red bayberry were not significantly removed by sanitizing with SH p  0.05.Sanitizing with SC resulted in significant reductions in aerobic bacteria E. coli O157H7 yeast and S. Typhimurium on strawberry  significant reductions in all microbiota and pathogens on cherry tomato  and significant reductions in E. coli O157H7 on red bayberry .

Moreover LA produced the largest reductions in E. coli O157H7 on red bayberry 4.31 log cfug and S. Typhimurium on strawberry 6.95 log cfug among all the sanitizing treatments in this study .

The average microbial reductions on strawberry were 2.14 log cfug for aerobic bacteria 0.40 log cfug for E. coli 1.33 log cfug for mold and 1.27 log cfug for yeast .

The average microbial reductions on cherry tomato were 2.63 log cfug for aerobic bacteria 1.53 log cfug for E. coli 1.55 log cfug for mold and 2.04 log cfug for yeast .

In general 0.1 ASC and 2 LA were the most effective treatments for the three types of produce in this study and treatment with 0.1 ASC was optimal because of the shorter sanitizing time and lower SC content.TABLE 2  The largest reductions log cfug and corresponding sanitizing methods for different microbespathogens on fresh strawberry cherry tomato and red bayberry.Sanitizer typeFresh produceAerobic bacteriaE.

Previous studies reported that treatment with 2 LA reduced E. coli O157H7 by 1.74 log cfug and S. Typhimurium by 1.73 log cfug on fresh organic lettuce  .

Moreover ASC also produced the greatest reductions in aerobic bacteria 4.01 log cfug on strawberry and yeast 3.04 log cfug and mold 1.52 log cfug on cherry tomato .

Typhimurium were efficiently removed 2.39-6.95 log cfug on the three fresh fruits by sanitizing with 2 LA and the results were more efficient than those of on other previous investigations     .Treatment with SH SC and ASCCompared to TW-2 sanitizing with SH resulted in significant reductions in aerobic bacteria E. coli O157H7 mold andS.

found that treatment with 2 LA reduced E. coli O157H7 S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes by approximately 3.0 log cfug on minimally processed lotus sprouts and the sanitizing efficiency of different treatments followed the approximate order of 2 LA  1 LA  0.5 LA  SH.
