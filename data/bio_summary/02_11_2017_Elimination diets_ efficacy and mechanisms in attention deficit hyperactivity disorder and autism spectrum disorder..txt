despite the lack of clear serological markers indicat- ing food allergy in adhd future studies should further investigate this open question and examine whether food allergy or hypersensitivity could play a role in adhd and mediate elimination diets' effects particularly given the previous findings suggesting a link between adhd and allergies   .microbiome-gut-brain axisdiet and the role of the microbiome in health and diseasethe intestinal microbial flora is involved in appetite regula- tion energy utilization digestion and absorption of nutri- ents  .

although the etiology of asd and adhd remains largely unknown a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors is thought to contribute to the development of asd and adhd   .one of the potential environmental risk factors for neu- rodevelopmental disorders is diet .

more knowledge about the mechanisms underlying elimi- nation diets' effects in adhd and asd is needed.clinical implications and future researchthe gfcf diet might be beneficial for children with asd and food intoleranceallergy or underlying gastrointesti- nal disease.

thus an elimination diet can be regarded as a 'diagnostic' tool for determining whether specific foods cause adverse physical andor behavioral reactions.evidence for elimination diets' effects on adhd and asd symptomsgluten-freecasein-free diet in children with asdthere is increasing research into the effectiveness of the gfcf diet in children diagnosed with asd.

therefore a dietary treatment that is able to restore the gut permeability can be effective as a treatment for children with asd -.the role of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in adhdalthough direct evidence for a role of changed microbi- ome-gut-brain interaction is currently lacking in adhd converging evidence suggests that similar alterations in microbiome-gut-brain interaction can contribute to adhd symptoms as well  .

we conclude with practical implications and future directions into the investigation of an elimination diet's efficacy in the treatment of attention deficit hyperac- tivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder.keywords elimination diet  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  autism spectrum disorder  food sensitivity  gut-brain interactionintroductionautism spectrum disorder asd and attention deficit hyper- activity disorder adhd are early onset neurodevelopmen- tal disorders that may persist into adulthood.

in asd the gluten-free andor casein-free gfcf diet has been mainly investigated whereas in adhd clinical tri- als examined the effects of food additives exclusion diets and the oligoantigentic diets.

hence until there is conclusive evidence for the benefits of gfcf diets for children with asd it is the task of health professionals and researchers to commu- nicate with caregivers and inform them about the costs and potential adverse consequences.benefits of food additives exclusion diets have been suggested in children diagnosed with adhd.

it has been suggested that the effect of food color elimination on behavior is probably not limited to children with a diagno- sis of adhd but rather also applies to hyperactive behav- ior in children more generally .with regard to oligoantigenic diets the effectivenessof the elimination phase has been demonstrated in sev- eral randomized clinical trials with patients with adhd.

the observed effects for food additives exclu- sion diets in children with adhd are small and may not be specific for children with adhd.
