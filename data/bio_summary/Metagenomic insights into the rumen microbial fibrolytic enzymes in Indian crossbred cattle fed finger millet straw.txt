the rumen has evolved into an efficient and effec- tive fermentation vat for fiber degradation and the rumen is inhabited by a consortium of microorganisms con- sisting of bacteria archaea fungi protozoa and viruses miron et al.

pope et al.

among the various domains of microorganisms residentin the rumen bacteria are predominant representing about 95 of the total microbes mackie et al.

the rumen fermentation process mediated by microbial communities affects the quality and compo- sition of milk and meat and the productive performance of the host welkie et al.

numerous metagenomic studies have reported on the diversity of fibrolytic enzymes from the rumen of yak dai et al.

the library was then loaded onto the illumina miseq plat- form for cluster generation and subjected to paired-end sequencing.metagenome assembly and bioinformatic analysisde novo assembly of high quality data was accomplished using the clc genomics workbench 6.0 qiagen usa at default parameters minimum contig length 200 auto- matic word size yes perform scaffolding yes mismatch cost 2 insertion cost 3 deletion cost 3 length fraction 0.5 similarity fraction 0.8. bioinformatic analysis of the metadata was performed with metagenome rapid anno- tation using subsystem technology mg-rast meyer et al.

the metadata were functionally categorized via an rps-blast comparison with the subsystem data- base overbeek et al.

and kegg databases kane- hisa and goto .carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation and taxonomic profilingthe fibrolytic gene encoding contigs from the metadata were identified and classified based on the carbohydrate- active enzymes database cantarel et al.
