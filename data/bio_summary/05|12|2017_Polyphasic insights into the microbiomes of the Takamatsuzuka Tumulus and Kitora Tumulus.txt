The number of samples were as follows 4 sam- ples collected in 2006 before the dismantling work from the stone chamber interior 36 samples from the jointspace of the wall stone 10 samples from the adjacent room 45 samples from the stone chamber exterior and 14 burial mound samples.The bands derived from Ochrobactrum were detected in samples from both the stone chamber interior and exte- rior.

P. paneum was isolated from various samples collected from the stone chamber interior and neighboring environment including the mural paintings and plaster surface of the stone walls the joint space between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior.

Thus another possi- ble route of invasion of K. phycomyces into the stone cham- ber is via plant roots.Further possible major invasion routes into the TT stone chamber are considered to be the big hole on the south wall made by thieves during the Kamakura period in AD 1185-1333 the adjacent spaceroom the jointspace of the stone walls and cracks in the stone walls Figs.

The characteristics of TT including the stone chamber and mural paintings and related environ- mental data have been fully described in the 2004-2005 excavation survey reports Agency for Cultural Affairs Japan 1987 Nara National Research Institute of Cultural Properties 2006.The stone chamber was constructed within the tumulus using cut slabs of tuff stone.

A total of 716 sam- ples including mold spots viscous gels biofilms and mixtures of plaster fragments and soil were collected from the TT stone chamber interior spaces between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior between May 2004 and February 2009 Fig.

These TT samples were clas- sified according to the sampling area into the following categories stone chamber interior adjacent space joint space of the stone walls stone chamber exterior andmound Fig.

S1 were collected from the stone chamber interior spaces between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior of TT between May 2004 and February 2009 Fig.

These were 90 samples gathered from the stone chamber interior during May 2004 to December 2006 19 from the adjacent space during May 2004 to July 2006 50 from the joint space of the stone walls during April 2007 to August 2007 66 from the stone chamber exterior during November 2006 to August 2007 and 11 from the mound during February 2008 to February 2009.4-1-1.

During the dismantling and relocation of the stone chamber between April and August 2007 Cylindrocarpon taxonomically and ecologically similar to Fusarium was isolated from samples recovered from the joint spaces between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior.

The stone cham- ber interior contained 90 samples collected from May 2004 to December 2006 the adjacent space contained 19 sam- ples collected from May 2004 to July 2006 the joint space of the stone walls contained 50 samples gathered fromApril to August 2007 the stone chamber exterior contained 66 samples gathered from November 2006 to August 2007 and the mound contained 11 samples gathered from Feb- ruary 2008 to 2009.From the total of 236 samples 1410 fungal isolates in- cluding unidentified groups were isolated and identified at the genusspecies level Fig.
