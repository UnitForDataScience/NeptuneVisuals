2. these were 90 samples gathered from the stone chamber interior during may 2004 to december 2006 19 from the adjacent space during may 2004 to july 2006 50 from the joint space of the stone walls during april 2007 to august 2007 66 from the stone chamber exterior during november 2006 to august 2007 and 11 from the mound during february 2008 to february 2009.4-1-1. changes in mycobiota of the stone chamber inte- rior between may 2004 and december 2006. a total of 426 isolates were obtained from the stone chamber inte- rior between may 2004 and december 2006. the succes- sion of mycobiota of the stone chamber interior mainly based on the major fungal genera is summarized in fig.from may to september 2004 fusarium fssc clade trichoderma and penicillium mainly penicillium sp.

penicillium paneum was consistently iso- lated from the stone chamber interior before and after cool- ing of the stone chamber since may 2004. p. paneum was isolated from various samples collected from the stone chamber interior and neighboring environment including the mural paintings and plaster surface of the stone walls the joint space between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior.

the number of samples were as follows 4 sam- ples collected in 2006 before the dismantling work from the stone chamber interior 36 samples from the jointspace of the wall stone 10 samples from the adjacent room 45 samples from the stone chamber exterior and 14 burial mound samples.the bands derived from ochrobactrum were detected in samples from both the stone chamber interior and exte- rior.

various fungi were isolated from the joint space of the stone walls in addition to other areas of tt table 4. the joint spaces of the stone walls are located between the stone chamber interior and exterior in both the stone chamber exterior and the burial mound.

2016 stackebrandt and embley 2000 even within a tumulus stone chamber which has a volume of only 3.13 m3 as in the case of the tt stone chamber interior.accurate species identification descriptions and records of species with complete bioprofiling or biologi- cal characterization are essential for monitoring anything from global climate change systematics agenda 2000 1994 to a small tumulus stone chamber this review.

thus another possi- ble route of invasion of k. phycomyces into the stone cham- ber is via plant roots.further possible major invasion routes into the tt stone chamber are considered to be the big hole on the south wall made by thieves during the kamakura period in ad 1185-1333 the adjacent spaceroom the jointspace of the stone walls and cracks in the stone walls figs.

the characteristics of tt including the stone chamber and mural paintings and related environ- mental data have been fully described in the 2004-2005 excavation survey reports agency for cultural affairs japan 1987 nara national research institute of cultural properties 2006.the stone chamber was constructed within the tumulus using cut slabs of tuff stone.

a total of 716 sam- ples including mold spots viscous gels biofilms and mixtures of plaster fragments and soil were collected from the tt stone chamber interior spaces between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior between may 2004 and february 2009 fig.

these tt samples were clas- sified according to the sampling area into the following categories stone chamber interior adjacent space joint space of the stone walls stone chamber exterior andmound fig.

s1 were collected from the stone chamber interior spaces between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior of tt between may 2004 and february 2009 fig.

during the dismantling and relocation of the stone chamber between april and august 2007 cylindrocarpon taxonomically and ecologically similar to fusarium was isolated from samples recovered from the joint spaces between the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior.

s3 table 4 including 426 from the stone chamber interior 72 from the adjacent space 337 from the joint space of the stone walls 451 from the stone chamber exterior and 124 from the mound.

p. paneum the predominant colonizer of the stone chamber interior wereisolated from the adjacent space the joint space of the stone walls and the stone chamber exterior but not from the mound.

isolates of the fscc clade were mainly isolated from the stone chamber interior and the joint space of the stone walls and a few were found on the stone chamber exterior and within the mound.

2011. none of the species isolated from mound samples were found in any other area namely the stone chamber interior adja- cent space jointspace of stone walls and stone chamber interior.fig.
