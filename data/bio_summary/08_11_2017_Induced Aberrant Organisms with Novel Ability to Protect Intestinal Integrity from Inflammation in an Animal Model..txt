in addition aberrant organisms contained 2 masses of rudimentary organelles as residuum of sporocysts figure c. however normal and aberrant organisms both had an equal number of 8 banana-shape-sporozoites.

all animals were challenged with a high pathogenic dose of normal form 24000. those animals immunized with aberrant organisms gained weight more and developed lower cecal pathological lesions than those immunized with normal organisms.

methods cyclophosphamide-immunodeficient and immune-intact-chicks were inoculated with induced aberrant or normal coccidal-organisms.

the aberrant organisms proved to be less pathogenic than the normal form in inbred leghorn-chicks but similarly immunogenic.

in addition immunogenicity of these aberrant forms is examined and compared to normal organisms utilizing two diverse inbred chicks rhode island red and new hampshire strains.materials and methodsethical guidelines for the use of animalsthis investigation was conducted according to the guidelines of the national institute of health and the international and the american pain associations.

weight gainloss was calculated by subtracting the initial weight before inoculation from the weight obtained following challenge and before termination.cyclophosphamide immunosuppressed birdsimmunodeficient birds were utilized in order to investigate fine pathological differences between the normal or aberrant organisms.
