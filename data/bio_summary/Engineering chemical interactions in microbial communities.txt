these experiments suggest that by engineering rhizobium strains to use ferrichrome-bound iron the population of these organisms in the rhizosphere can be increased leading to enhanced plant growth promotion.microbes have not yet been engineered to use host plant phytosiderophores but it is possible this would facilitate atighter association of the engineered microbe to its host in a manner that would not depend on the identities of its microbial neighbors.

drivers of the microbial diversity within the root micro- biota include the genotype age and health of the host plant the nutrient composition ph and moisture of the surrounding soil and the other microbes present in the community.36-38recent studies have examined microbial communities associated with many different plant species ranging from the model plant arabidopsis thaliana to merlot grapevines and citrus trees with each plant possessing a different core microbiota.39-41 one mechanism by which plants are able to preferentially enrich for specific microbes in the rhizosphere-associated microbiota is through the production and excretion of small molecules from their roots.42 this collection of secreted molecules termed the root exudate comprises up to 21 of total carbon fixed by plants3642 and includes carbohydrates amino acids hormones secondary metabolites and other molecules that can act as chemoattractants or nutrient sources for beneficial soil microbes.37some of the small molecule interactions known to affect community composition of the root microbiota have beenfig.

investigated whether gut microbes could be engineered to produce napes in the small intestine to supple- ment the host's biosynthesis and affect similar changes to host physiology as direct feeding of napes.124 they engineered the probiotic strain e. coli nissle 1917 ecn to produce napes by expressing at1g78690p an n-acetyl transferase from a. thaliana that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine and acyl-coas to n-acylphosphatidylethanolamine.125 the engineered strain of e. coli pnape-ecn was administered in drinking water over the course of 8 weeks to mice fed a high fat diet.

for instance bacterial and plant genes involved in the biosynthesis of vitamin k and folate have been described and could potentially be expressed in a genetically tractable and safe heterologous host for administration.120-122in addition to providing dietary compounds not produced by the host microbes can also be engineered to synthesize host-derived molecules.

the plant growth-promoting effects of rhizosphere microbes have been well studied and can occur through a variety of mechanisms.3638 these microbes provide plant hosts with important nutrients modulate critical phytohormone levels increase drought resistance and help to exclude pathogens by producing antibiotics and modulating the host's immune response.the most well-studied mechanism of plant growth promotion by the root microbiota is through microbial-assisted nutrient acquisition via the process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation snf that occurs in the root nodules of legumes fig.

while the exact mechanism for these plant growth- and drought tolerance-promoting effects is unknown it is believed that recognition of trehalose by the plant results in changes in gene expression that both promote plant growth and protect the plant from environmental stressors.

in this section we will discuss the general strategies used to accomplish three main goals engineering bacteria to 1 colonize the host and stably integrate into an existing microbial community through utilization of previously inaccessible trophic interactions 2 provide growth advantages to the host through modulation of small molecule interactions and 3 prevent pathogens from infecting the host through the production of small molecules.

a phylogenetic analysis comparing acc deaminase activity in a variety of mesorhizobiumspecies with different host plants showed that the acc deaminase expressed in a particular mesorhizobium species could not be predicted by the phylogeny of the strain but rather by which host plant the strain occupied.

pnape-ecn persisted in the mouse gut for at least 4 weeks after administration had stopped with significant differences in body weight between vehicle and pnape-ecn treated mice lasting even after 12 weeks since last administration.from these experiments it appears that it is possible to use an engineered organism to augment production of host meta- bolites and benefit host health.

this strategy may be generalized to promote other aspects of plant health.as it is still challenging to engineer many plant species andnot yet feasible to genetically engineer humans the engineering of host-associated microbes may provide a more tractable way of introducing beneficial functions into a host.

''35 along with rhizosphere microbes the plant root microbiota also includes endophytes symbiotic bacteria archaea and fungi that live inside plant tissues.35 while endophytes have been found in all plant species studied to date in many cases their precise function isunknown.

amino acids are then exported from the nodule back to the plant root providing a useable source of nitrogen for the plant host.aside from providing critical nutrients the root microbiota also promotes plant health through the suppression of pathogens.

in a particularly striking example gut microbes found in a japanese population acquired genes from marine bacteria involved in metabolizing polysaccharides found in seaweed an important component of the traditional japanese diet.109 in cheese rind communities roughly 23 of horizontally transferred genes were involved in nutrient acquisition including genes encoding siderophore biosynthetic enzymes and receptors.110 by using these experiments of nature to identify pathways that are important in particular habitats we may be able to develop engineered microbes well suited for target host-associated microbial communities.chemical interactions that promote host healthmicrobes have been engineered to produce small molecules for industrial medical and agricultural purposes.

in a recent study the pnape-ecn was further engineered to express the murine nape-pld enzyme creating a strain of e. coli pnae-ecn capable of synthesizing naes without host involvement.126 in nape-pld-- mice incapable of converting napes to naes pnae-ecn is able to increase nae levels in adipose tissue and decrease both food intake and weight gain in a similar manner to pnape-ecn administered to wild-type mice.126in addition to providing host-derived molecules microbes can be engineered to supply molecules produced by other microbes within a community.
