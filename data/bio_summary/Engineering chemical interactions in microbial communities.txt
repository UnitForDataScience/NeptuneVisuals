In this final section we aim to discuss some caveats associated with engineering single microbes to participate in chemical interactions and highlight future directions the field could take to expand the utility of these approaches.Benefits and drawbacks of using engineered microbes to modulate chemical interactions in microbial communitiesIntroducing engineered microbes into host-associated microbial communities to modulate small molecule interactions has some advantages over administration of either the compounds them- selves or pre-assembled microbial communities.32 In contrast to the direct administration of small molecules engineered microbes may eventually provide a cheap and reproducible means of administration avoiding the need for formulation and purification of the active compounds as well as the issue of patient compliance.

These experiments suggest that by engineering Rhizobium strains to use ferrichrome-bound iron the population of these organisms in the rhizosphere can be increased leading to enhanced plant growth promotion.Microbes have not yet been engineered to use host plant phytosiderophores but it is possible this would facilitate atighter association of the engineered microbe to its host in a manner that would not depend on the identities of its microbial neighbors.

investigated whether gut microbes could be engineered to produce NAPEs in the small intestine to supple- ment the host's biosynthesis and affect similar changes to host physiology as direct feeding of NAPEs.124 They engineered the probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 EcN to produce NAPEs by expressing At1g78690p an N-acetyl transferase from A. thaliana that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine and acyl-CoAs to N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine.125 The engineered strain of E. coli pNAPE-EcN was administered in drinking water over the course of 8 weeks to mice fed a high fat diet.

As progress advances in both of these research areas it may become possible to engineer specific chemical interactions to promote a variety of desired outcomes including shifting the composition of a microbial community increasing resistance to pathogens and supplying the host with nutrients.In this review we highlight recent progress in engineering individual microbial strains to participate in chemical interactions in the context of host-associated microbial communities.

Advances in CRISPRCas technology have led to the ability to make precise mutations in the genomes of a variety of different host-associated microorganisms including difficult to engineer anaerobic spore-forming Clostridia from the soil and human microbiota.169170 Novel approaches using bacteriophage to engineer microbes within a community have also seen success.171 Furthermore multiple labs studying the abundant human commensal B. thetaiotaomicron have developed systems to express proteins with great specificity to allow for more precise engineering of this host organism.172173Linking small molecules and metabolic processes in microbial communities to microbial genesRecently our understanding of chemical interactions within host-associated microbial communities has been greatly enhanced by the integration of different molecular approaches.

In this section we will discuss the general strategies used to accomplish three main goals engineering bacteria to 1 colonize the host and stably integrate into an existing microbial community through utilization of previously inaccessible trophic interactions 2 provide growth advantages to the host through modulation of small molecule interactions and 3 prevent pathogens from infecting the host through the production of small molecules.

difficile patients also showed a similar effect suggesting that secreted molecules and not the intact microbial community could be mediators of recovery.30 In an analogous example transplanting microbes from a healthy soil to a dysbiotic soil has been shown to restore plant biodiversity and ecosystem health to the recipient soil over the course of 6 years.31 Overall the recentappreciation of the role of beneficial microbes in human health and agriculture along with the recognition of host-associated microbial dysbiosis in many different settings has underscored the need for methods that can change the structures and functions of host-associated microbial communities.The development of modern tools for genetically manipulating organisms has raised the exciting possibility of modulating chemical interactions in communities using engineered microbes.

In a particularly striking example gut microbes found in a Japanese population acquired genes from marine bacteria involved in metabolizing polysaccharides found in seaweed an important component of the traditional Japanese diet.109 In cheese rind communities roughly 23 of horizontally transferred genes were involved in nutrient acquisition including genes encoding siderophore biosynthetic enzymes and receptors.110 By using these experiments of nature to identify pathways that are important in particular habitats we may be able to develop engineered microbes well suited for target host-associated microbial communities.Chemical interactions that promote host healthMicrobes have been engineered to produce small molecules for industrial medical and agricultural purposes.

Drivers of the microbial diversity within the root micro- biota include the genotype age and health of the host plant the nutrient composition pH and moisture of the surrounding soil and the other microbes present in the community.36-38Recent studies have examined microbial communities associated with many different plant species ranging from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to Merlot grapevines and citrus trees with each plant possessing a different core microbiota.39-41 One mechanism by which plants are able to preferentially enrich for specific microbes in the rhizosphere-associated microbiota is through the production and excretion of small molecules from their roots.42 This collection of secreted molecules termed the root exudate comprises up to 21 of total carbon fixed by plants3642 and includes carbohydrates amino acids hormones secondary metabolites and other molecules that can act as chemoattractants or nutrient sources for beneficial soil microbes.37Some of the small molecule interactions known to affect community composition of the root microbiota have beenFig.

To address this problem unbiased 'multi-omics' methods such as untargeted metabolomics metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics can be used to identify prevalent small molecule signals and signal- ing pathways within these communities.153154 Once appropriate signals are identified characterizing the effects of these molecules on both the host and surrounding microbes will enable researchers to assess how modifying these pathways will affect the biology of these host-associated microbial communities.Another limitation is the scope of molecules that are accessible via microbial metabolism in comparison to the diversity of molecules that can be chemically synthesized.
