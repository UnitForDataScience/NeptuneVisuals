38-40 42-48 and figure 1. herein we will focus on damp alarmins and their role in gi gvhd.atp is released from damaged cells and binds to the p2x fam- ily of purinergic receptors including p2x7 and p2y2 49-51. atp engagement of p2x7 on host hematopoietic apcs enhanced their activation amplified stimulation of the alloreactive donor cd4 t cells and enhanced th1 responses 50 whereas interruption of this pathway decreased gi tract gvhd 50. systemic admin- istration of broad-spectrum p2x7 antagonists attenuated gvhd 50 52. likewise gvhdwasmitigatedbytheabsenceofanother atp purinergic receptor p2y2 on the host hematopoietic- derived apcs 51. increased extracellular atp is regulated by ectonucleotidases such as cd73 ecto-5-nucleotidase which converts amp to adenosine 53. treatment of recipient mice with adenosine a2a receptor agonists decreased gvhd whereasthe absence of cd73 on either donor t cells or host apcs exacer- bated gvhd 54-56.ua a purine metabolite released from damaged cells is an endogenous damp that stimulates dcs and activates cd8 t cell cytotoxic functions 45 57. recent data show that ua contributes to gvhd severity by stimulating the nlrp3 inflammasome 57 58. hmgb1 is a ubiquitous dna-binding nuclear protein found in all eukaryotic cells that binds to nucleosomes and regulates gene transcription 46. it is released from damaged tissues and binds to prrs such as tlr2 tlr4 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products rage 46 59-62. increased hmgb1 is observed in recipient mice after experimental allo-hct 60 and treatment of hosts with indole-derived antioxidant mitigates the release of ros- dependent hmgb1 and reduces severity of gi tract gvhd 63. con- sistent with murine data an increase in serum levels of hmgb1 has been observed in patients with agvhd 64 but these levels have not yet been correlated directly with the severity of gi tract gvhd.alarmins can both induce and suppress immune responses in the gi tract.

soluble st2 levels are elevated in the blood early after allo-hct and an algorithm using both st2 and reg3 concentrations has been validated to predict lethal gvhd 7 days after transplant in a very large 1287 patients multicenter data set 141. reg3 emerged from an unbiased proteomic screen to identify plasma biomarkers specific for gi gvhd and in a multicenter data set of more than 1000 patients blood lev- els of reg3 increased fourfold in patients with lower gi tract gvhd but not in patients with enteritis from other causes 142.table 1. clinical approaches to enhancing homeostatic mechanisms in the gi tract during gvhddecreases proinflammatory t cellsmdsc myeloid-derived suppressor cell msc mesenchymal stem cell.the degree of reg3 elevation also predicted clinical response to gvhd therapy and correlated with increased paneth cell loss suggesting that increased levels reflected damage in the gi tract 142. a further analysis of bmt patients demonstrated that the loss of paneth cells in biopsies was positively correlated with the clinical severity of gi tract gvhd 143. the number of paneth cells inversely correlated with eventual response to treatment for gvhd and with nonrelapse mortality which was primarily from gi tract gvhd.therapeutic approaches.

the transfer of bm cells lacking smad3 a criti- cal signaling component of the tgf-b axis greatly increased gvhd lethality which correlated with enhanced th1 polarization of donor t cells and neutrophil recruitment to the gi tract mesenteric lns and spleen 89. depleting myeloid cells using anti-gr-1 mab therapy greatly improved the outcome of mice receiving smad-deficient bm 89.in intestinal epithelial cells iecs and regulates epithelial homeo- stasis and the gut microbiome 69 76. nlrp6 deficiency improved gvhd but exacerbated experimental inflammatory bowel disease 76 77. further bm chimera experiments have suggested a role for nonhematopoietic expression of nlpr6 in gi tract gvhd 48.apcs and gi tract gvhdhost apcs are key to the induction of gvhd 78 79. earlier stud- ies that primarily used adoptive transfer approaches demonstratedmicrobiome and gi gvhdforty years ago van bekkum and knaan reported that germ-free mice had minimal gvhd 90. this observation led to widespread use of antibiotics to decontaminate the gi tract before and dur- ing allo-hct.

the intestinal metabolome therefore consists of products from discrete host metabolism microbial metabolism and mam- malianmicrobial cometabolism 101. the impact of microbiota- derived metabolites is increasingly appreciated in intestinal homeostasis 101. short-chain fatty acids scfas are the most thoroughly studied microbial metabolites and are absorbed by the intestinal epithelium following the fermentation of complex poly- saccharides in the gut 100 101. the scfa butyrate is the major energy source for iecs 100 101. in one study the concentration of butyrate was significantly decreased in intestinal tissue after allo-hct although the concentrations of other scfas were not significantly changed in either serum or tissues 102. reduced butyrate in cd326 iecs after allo-hct contributed to decreased histone acetylation which was restored after local administra- tion of exogenous butyrate resulting in improved iec junctional integrity increased antiapoptotic proteins decreased gvhd and improved survival 102. additionally alteration of the indigenous microbiota with 17 rationally selected strains of high-butyrate- producing clostridia species also decreased gi tract gvhd and increased survival after allo-hct 102-104.theexpressionofindoleaminedioxygenaseido isincreased in intestinal cells and apcs after allo-hct 105 106. high ido expression depletes tryptophan resulting in apoptosis of alloreac- tive donor t effectors and generation of itregs 107 108. aside from these direct immune regulatory activities ido-generated tryptophan by-products may also suppress gvhd directly 89. clinical studies showed that lower levels of urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate an indole metabolite influenced by commensal bacteria correlated with decreased patient survival after allo-hct 109. a recent clinical study showed an association between gvhd the need for parenteral nutrition the loss of microbial diversity and reduced levels of blautia 98. in mouse models antibiotic treat- ment worsened gvhd increased gut damage and was associ- ated with increased akkermansia a mucus-devouring microbe93.

a1-antitrypsin aat a serine protease inhibi-tor predominantly generated in the liver possesses antiinflamma- tory properties that enhance the generation of il-10 and tgf-b and reduce the generation of il-6 by apcs 71. an initial role for aat in the biology of gvhd came from studies indicating that it decreased il-32 production in mixed lymphocyte responses 72. aat treat- ment of recipient mice in a minor-mismatched gvhd model diminished gi tract inflammation decreased generation of proin- flammatory cytokines and effector cells increased generation of tregs and host apc il-10 production and improved survival 73.inflammasomes and gi tract gvhdinflammasomes such as nlrp2 nlrp3 and nlrp6 are large cyto- solic complexes that sense damps and activate caspase-1 and -11 resulting in the production of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1b and il-18 74. nlrp3 activation enhanced gvhd 57 58 and donor nlrp3 polymorphisms have been associated with outcomes after allo-hct 75. two genetic variants in donor nlrp3 were asso- ciated with an increased risk of disease relapse 75. an increased risk for grades iii-iv agvhd was found in recipients with the nlrp2 cc genotype compared with caaa 75. additionally 2 genetic variants in nlrp2 in both donor and patient were associated with inferior nonrelapse mortality and survival 75. nlrp6 is expressedfigure 2. late gastrointestinal gvhd pathophysiology.

reg3 stored in the mucus and in paneth cells enters the bloodstream as the epithelial barrier is lost.a critical role for host bm dcs or plasma- cytoid dcs pdcs when transferred into mhc-deficient recipients 80-82. by con- trast studies with host b cell transfer did not induce gvhd 80. loss-of-function studies demonstrated that recipient cd11c dcs are not required to initiate cd4 t cell- mediated gi gvhd 83 84. furthermore neither recipient macrophages pdcs b cells basophils nor langerhans cells were required to initiate gvhd when other apcs were competent suggesting considerable redundancy among professional hemato- poietic apcs 83-85. importantly recent studies show that recipient nonhematopoi- etic apcs can also initiate gvhd as sche- matized in figure 2 and ref.

in contrast cefepime and aztreonam which have very limited anaerobic activity were not associated with gvhd-related mortality 93. interestingly pro- phylaxis with rifaximin a nonabsorbed broad-spectrum oral antibi- otic was associated with a decrease in enterococcus species higher levels of urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate which is associated with the presence of clostridiales and improved survival compared with ciprofloxacin and the antianaerobic antibiotic metronidazole 94. experimental models have shown a persistent loss of gi microbial diversity in animals with gvhd 95 96 and the mag- nitude of the loss correlated with treatment-related mortality after allo-hct 97. loss of commensals such as blautia and lactoba- cillus is associated with the overgrowth of pathogens such as pro- teobacteria and enterococcus which correlates with gi gvhd 93 97-99. it is not yet clear whether antibiotic dysbiosis is a primary or secondary phenomenon in gvhd.

mice lacking il-17a il-17f or their receptors developed significant gi tract gvhd which correlated with microbial dysbiosis 124. il-23 generated by donor apcs has been shown to play a critical role in the induc- tion of gvhd in the lower gi tract 125. recently a population of cd4 t cells that coexpresses the il-23 receptor cd11c and innate cell tlr and nlr proteins was shown to be critical to the induction of gi gvhd by il-23.
