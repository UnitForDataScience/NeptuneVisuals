no differentially abun- dant otus were identified between disease status in the upper respiratory tract.effects of dexamethasone on the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiotadexamethasone had an effect on the lower respiratory tract microbiota of both healthy and iad horses fig.

testing for a difference between the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota revealed a change in the relative abundance of 2 otus with moraxella increased in the upper re- spiratory tract and cupriavidus increased in the lower respiratory tract additional file figure s3.

dexametha- sone corticosteroids are effective at controlling air- way inflammation and inhibiting airway hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity thus improving pulmonary function however as corticosteroids can cause immunosup- pression within the respiratory tract treating iad with dexamethasone could potentially influence the lower respiratory tract bacterial communities promoting the overgrowth of specific bacteria which may in turn contribute to recrudescence of disease upon cessation of treatment.

perhaps control of bacterial over- growth in iad horses treated with dexamethasone could be part of the treatment strategy.additional filesabbreviationsbal bronchoalveolar lavage control healthy control group no dexamethasone n  3 dex healthy dexamethasone group n  3 iad inflammatory airway disease mild equine asthma lrt lower respiratory tract nmds nonmetric multidimensional scalingnps nasopharyngeal swab otu operational taxonomic unit ttw transtracheal wash urt upper respiratory tractacknowledgementsthe authors would like to acknowledge persephone greco-otto for help with sample collection long jin for assistance with dna extraction and shelly wegener for performing the library preparation and 16s sequencing.fundinginternal eyes high funding from the university of calgary faculty of veterinary medicine.availability of data and materialsthe datasets used andor analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

currently the impact of dexamethasone on the equine respiratory microbiota is unknown.the objectives of the current study were therefore i to characterize the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota associated with health and mild iad mild asthma and ii to investigate the effects of dexa- methasone on these bacterial communities using high throughput sequencing.methodsethics statementthis study was conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations of the canadian council of animal care.

this overgrowth of certain bacteria in the lower respiratory tract could be secondary to the immunomodu- lation induced by the dexamethasone treatment with the reduction in candidatussaccaribacteria otu providing supportive evidence that dexamethasone treatment also de- creased evenness in the lower airways of both healthyand iad horses.

there was a clear sep- aration between the bacterial community in the lower respiratory tract of healthy and iad horses with 6 otus in the tracheal community having different abun- dance with disease status including an increase in streptococcus in horses with iad.

indicating that while there was an overall decrease in species richness even- ness remained unchanged.differences between healthy and iad horsesdifferences in bacterial communities at the upper and lower respiratory tract level between disease status were visualized using nmds fig.

after 10 days of dexamethasone administration the lower respiratory tract of both healthy and iad horses experienced a significant change in the abun- dance of 11 otus additional file figure s4 with 9 otus responding similarly between disease status fig.

using high throughput sequencing we showed a difference in the lower respiratory tract be- tween healthy and iad horses with 6 otus having dif- ferent abundances.

dexamethasone induced a distinct shift in the community structure of the lower respiratory tract in both healthy horses and those with iad with a sig- nificant change in the abundance of 11 otus with 9 otus responding similarly to treatment.
