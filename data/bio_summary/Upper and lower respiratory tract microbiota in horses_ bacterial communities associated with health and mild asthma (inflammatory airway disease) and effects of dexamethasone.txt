Bond1 Edouard Timsit1 Matthew Workentine1 Trevor Alexander2 and Renaud Leguillette1BackgroundHorses can suffer from airway inflammation resulting in severe or mild asthma Severe equine asthma Recurrent Airway Obstruction is less common than mild asthma in North America and manifest by in- creased respiratory effort at rest  Mild equine asthma also known as Inflammatory Airway Disease IAD affects up to 66 of the equine population Correspondence  1Faculty of Veterinary Medicine University of Calgary Calgary AB Canada Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleand results in a mild increased resistance to airflow during exercise within the lower airways - Clinical signs of IAD are typically subtle at rest with horses exhibiting normal respiratory effort and occasional coughing at work increased nasal discharge cough and poor performance are observed Although IAD is primarily an inflammatory process an infectious component is highly suspected -.

No differentially abun- dant OTUs were identified between disease status in the upper respiratory tract.Effects of dexamethasone on the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiotaDexamethasone had an effect on the lower respiratory tract microbiota of both healthy and IAD horses Fig.

Testing for a difference between the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota revealed a change in the relative abundance of 2 OTUs with Moraxella increased in the upper re- spiratory tract and Cupriavidus increased in the lower respiratory tract Additional file Figure S3.

CONTROL horses were kept in the same environment as both IAD and DEX groups and were sampled at the same time-points but were given no dexamethasoneTable 2 Relative abundance of the 6 dominant phyla observed in the upper and lower respiratory tract of healthy horsesn  6 at day 0 and relative abundance of genus within each phylumPhylum mean relative abundance  Genus mean relative abundanceper phylum Proteobacteria 43.85Sphingomonas 35.69Pantoea 26.65Pseudomonas 14.57Massilia 5.59Rhizobium 3.35Mesorhizobium 2.20Naxibacter 1.60Serratia 1.39Devosia 1.32Actinobacteria 21.63Agrococcus 15.67Knoellia 12.98Arthrobacter 12.1Microbacterium 8.56Corynebacterium 7.27Brachybacterium 5.93Ornithinimicrobium 5.06Brevibacterium 4.06Rhodococcus 4.03Kocuria 3.88Dietzia 3.71Rothia 2.5Clavibacter 1.87Rathayibacter 1.65Marmoricola 1.55Streptomyces 1.29Nocardioides 1.24Firmicutes 16.82Jeotgalicoccus 30.8Planomicrobium 19.52Gemella 16.63Atopostipes 5.91Bacillus 4.68Staphylococcus 3.6Sporosarcina 2.55Facklamia 2.23Trichococcus 1.85Streptococcus 1.79Carnobacterium 1.72Aerococcus 1.23Bacteroidetes 13.24Hymenobacter 42.65Pedobacter 17.93Prevotella 17.42Table 2 Relative abundance of the 6 dominant phyla observed in the upper and lower respiratory tract of healthy horsesn  6 at day 0 and relative abundance of genus within each phylum ContinuedFlavisolibacter 12.19Gillisia 3.1Chryseobacterium 2.69Cloacibacterium 1.66Ferruginibacter 1.51Verrucomicrobia 0.79Luteolibacter 20.93Akkermansia 8.79Chloroflexi 0.51Sphaerobacter 97.84Litorilinea 2.16appropriately controls for over-dispersed data and variable library sizes .

dexametha- sone Corticosteroids are effective at controlling air- way inflammation and inhibiting airway hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity thus improving pulmonary function However as corticosteroids can cause immunosup- pression within the respiratory tract treating IAD with dexamethasone could potentially influence the lower respiratory tract bacterial communities promoting the overgrowth of specific bacteria which may in turn contribute to recrudescence of disease upon cessation of treatment.

Using de-novo clustering 2209 OTUs were identified and 963 OTUs remained after filtering low abundance and rare OTUs.Upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota in healthy horsesNineteen phyla were identified in the respiratory tract of healthy horses at day 0 n  6 with six phyla showing a relative abundance  0.1 Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Chloroflexi Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Verrucomi- crobia Table Fig.

Currently the impact of dexamethasone on the equine respiratory microbiota is unknown.The objectives of the current study were therefore i to characterize the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota associated with health and mild IAD mild asthma and ii to investigate the effects of dexa- methasone on these bacterial communities using high throughput sequencing.MethodsEthics statementThis study was conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council of Animal Care.

This overgrowth of certain bacteria in the lower respiratory tract could be secondary to the immunomodu- lation induced by the dexamethasone treatment with the reduction in CandidatusSaccaribacteria OTU providing supportive evidence that dexamethasone treatment also de- creased evenness in the lower airways of both healthyand IAD horses.

There was a clear sep- aration between the bacterial community in the lower respiratory tract of healthy and IAD horses with 6 OTUs in the tracheal community having different abun- dance with disease status including an increase in Streptococcus in horses with IAD.
