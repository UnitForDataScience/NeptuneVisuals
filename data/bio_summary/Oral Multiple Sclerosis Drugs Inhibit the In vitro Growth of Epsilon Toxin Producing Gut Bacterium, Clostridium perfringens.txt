Therefore we tested if oral DMDs affected the growth of C. perfringens toxinotypes A-E. We compared the growth inhibitory effects of Fingolimod DMF and Teriflunomide to that of oral symptom management drugs SMDs Baclofen Bupropion and Gabapentin drugs not thought to alter the disease course of MS. We exposed C. perfringens cultures to 500 ugml of each compound allowed for overnight anaerobic growth and determined the optical density OD600 the following day.

aureus and B. anthracis growth and to suppress S. aureus43Therefore depleting C. perfringens of thiols may contribute toMichael acceptor mediated growth inhibition.Although Teriflunomide is an a b unsaturated carbonyl we have shown that glutathione has no effect on its ability to inhibit C. perfringens growth.

Because during log-phase growth C. perfringens secretes ETX a toxin that specifically targets the BBB and the myelin sheath we chose to investigate the effect of these oral MS therapies on C. perfringens growth in vitro.METHODSDrugs and CompoundsAll drugs and compounds used in this study were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.Bacterial Strains and Growth ConditionsC.

Local release of DMF may increase its concentration in the small intestine where C. perfringens resides.Second our experimental growth conditions are likely to be more favorable to C. perfringens growth than the intestinal milieu.

MIC-values were plotted for each compound revealing Gambogic acid as the most potent with an MIC95 of 1 ugml when compared to Parthenolide and Curcumin which each inhibit C. perfringens at 64 ugml.striking that nucleophilic thiols not only play an important role in mammalian cell homeostasis but are also necessary substrates for C. perfringens growth.

Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student t-test GraphPad Software San Diego CA USA.RESULTSWith renewed interest in gut bacteria and their potential involvement in the pathogenesis of MS Bhargava and Mowry 2014 we wished to determine if oral disease-modifying drugs DMDs have the ability to modulate growth of C. perfringens since type B and D strains secrete ETX during log-phase growth.

Fingolimod inhibited C. perfringens growth in a bactericidal fashion similar to what was observed with the known bactericidal antibiotic mixture penstrep aspost-treatment dilution and repeat culture failed to restore bacterial growth.Conversely DMF and Teriflunomide were shown to be bacteriostatic aspost-treatment dilution and culture successfully restored bacterial growth.

Prediction of michael-type acceptor reactivity Strader C. R. Pearce C. J. and Oberlies N. H. 2011.

Here we show that Fingolimod Teriflunomide and DMF indeed inhibit C. perfringens growth.

Moreover inhibition of C. perfringens growth and resulting blockade of epsilon toxin production may contribute to the clinical efficacy of these disease-modifying drugs.Keywords multiple sclerosis oral therapies anti-bacterial agents Clostridium perfringens microbiomeINTRODUCTIONMultiple sclerosis MS is the most common non-traumatic neurological disease of young adults in Western Europe and North America Conway and Cohen 2010.
