In this review we summarize the current literature regard- ing the role of the gut microbiota the association between the gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of IBD and the potential therapeutic options for targeting the gut microbiota.Physiological role of the gut microbiotaThe benefits of the gut microbiota to the host's physiology can be grouped into three categories--nutrition immune development and host defense Fig.

Collectively these data strongly indicate that the alteration of gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of IBD.The effects of medication for IBD on gut microbiotaMedication for IBD also affects the composition of gut microbiota.

This review is focused on the physiological function of the gut microbiota and the associa- tion between the gut microbiota and pathogenesis in IBD.

This has evoked the possibility that gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD  .The human gut harbors 100 trillion different microbial organisms including bacteria viruses fungi and proto- zoa which constitute the microbiota also referred to as the microbial flora .

Another study using healthy dogs has reported that no significant change was observed in the gut microbiota due to the administration of glucocorticoids .Collectively medication for IBD could change or modu- late the gut microbiota.

Therefore the gut virome as well as the gut microbiota should be taken into consideration when evaluating the efficacy of FMT for IBD.

This may be caused by the increased number of mucolytic bacteria such as Runinococcus gnavas and Ruminococcus torques in IBD patients .The production of metabolites affected by the disruptionof gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of IBD.

The human gut harbors a complex and abundant aggregation of microbes collectively referred to as the gut microbiota.

We review these three major functions of the gut microbiota.NutritionThe gut microbiota supplies energy and nutrients to the host .

The gut microbiota contributes to host defense nutrition and the devel- opment of the immune systemsystem becomes underdeveloped in germ-free mice colo- nized with human microbiota .The gut microbiota also modulates T-cell repertoires and regulates the T helper Th cell profile  .
