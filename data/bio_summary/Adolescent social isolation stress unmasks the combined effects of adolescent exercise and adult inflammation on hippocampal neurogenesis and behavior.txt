A trend for a reduction of weight gain was observed in pair housed mice with access to a running wheel F 1 28  10.39 p  0.065 while there was no effect of IL-1b F 1 28  1.50 p  0.05 nor an interaction effectF 1 28  0.01 p  0.05 C.

Interestingly singly housed mice gained less weight than pair housed mice t 70  5.81 p  0.001 E.Spontaneous alternation testNo effect of exercise F 1 32  3.67 p  0.05 IL-1bF 1 32  0.29 p  0.05 or an interaction between the two F 1 32  0.38 p  0.05 was found in the number of spontaneous alternations completed by pair- housed mice A.

However when a priori t-tests were performed they indicated that IL-1b induced a deficit in novel object recognition in sedentary singly housed mice when compared to sedentary controls p  0.05 which was reversed in IL-1b-injected mice who had exercised p  0.05 E. Isolation housing stress alone did not impact on novel object performance as a t-test between the sedentary control animals from both pair and singly housed conditions revealed no significant difference t 18  0.81 p  0.43 F.Survival of new cells and neuronsIn pair-housed mice no change in cell survival measured by the number of BrdU cells was observed in response to exercise F 1 14  0.43 p  0.05 IL-1b F 1 14 0.47 p  0.05 or interaction between the two F 1 14  0.58 p  0.05 B.

When group performance was compared using ANOVA pair-housed mice showed no effect of exercise F 1 32  0.77 p  0.05 IL-1b F 1 32  1.28 p  0.05 or aninteraction effect between the two F 1 32  2.05 p  0.05 in the object recognition test D. In singly housed mice there were significant effects of IL-1b F 1 35  6.04 p  0.05 and exerciseF 1 35  4.26 p  0.05 on performance in this test.Posthoc analysis revealed that the discrimination ratio of mice injected with IL-1b was significantly decreased compared to controls while it was significantly increased in the mice with access to a running wheel.

Likewise in singly housed mice there was no effect of exercise F 1 18  0.20 p  0.05 IL-1b F 1 18  1.57p  0.05 nor the interaction between the two F 1 18  0.08 p  0.05 on the percentage of surviving new neurons data not shown.

Interestingly when the effect of isolation housing was directly examined a significant effect of housing was evident with singly- housed sedentary control mice having a reduced percentage of surviving new neurons compared to pair- housed sedentary control mice t 8  3.79 p  0.01 F.Newly born neuronsThe number of newly born neurons DCX cells was not altered by exercise F 1 13  0.00 p  0.05IL-1b F 1 13  0.32 p  0.05 or interaction between the two in the hippocampus of pair-housed mice F 1 13  0.02 p  0.05 B.

However while there was no effect of exercise F 1 35  0.77 p  0.05 or an interaction between exercise and IL-1b F 1 35 0.06 p  0.05 in singly housed mice an effect of IL-1b was unmasked F 1 35  7.69 p  0.01 with IL-1b treated animals performing fewer alternations than controls B.

In singly housed mice no change in BrdU cell number was seen in response to exercise F 1 18  0.48 p  0.05 or IL-1b F 1 18  0.03 p  0.05 while a trend for an interaction effect was observed F 1 18  3.17 p  0.09.

In addition this period of the lifespan represents a transitional phase where the programing of adult behav- iors occurs  and as such lifestyle modifications such as exercise during this time may also have a long-lasting impact on cognitive function .Based on these studies we hypothesized that isolation housing stress during adolescence would impair hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognitive behaviors that inflammation caused by increased hippocampal IL-1b would have a detrimental impact on both hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive performance under both housing conditions and that exercise would have a beneficial effect on these negative regulators of neurogenesis and behavior.
