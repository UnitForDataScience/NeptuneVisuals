in addition this period of the lifespan represents a transitional phase where the programing of adult behav- iors occurs  and as such lifestyle modifications such as exercise during this time may also have a long-lasting impact on cognitive function .based on these studies we hypothesized that isolation housing stress during adolescence would impair hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognitive behaviors that inflammation caused by increased hippocampal il-1b would have a detrimental impact on both hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive performance under both housing conditions and that exercise would have a beneficial effect on these negative regulators of neurogenesis and behavior.

additionally il-1b has been shown to medi- ate the stress-induced impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial and contextual memory  .in contrast to stress and il-1b aerobic exercise promotes both adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function  .

studies examining var- ious other cognitive and affective behavioral tasks will inform the role of neurogenesis during stress and other environmental influences such as exercise and inflammation.no negative effects of intra-hippocampal il-1boverexpression on hippocampal neurogenesis were observed in the pair-housed mice which is in contrast to a previous study that demonstrated that chronic overexpression of il-1b is sufficient to decrease the number of new neurons albeit in adult mice  .

adolescent social isolation stress unmasks the combined effects of adolescent exercise and adult inflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviorcara m. hueston john f. cryan and yvonne m. nolan a department of anatomy and neuroscience university college cork irelandb apc microbiome institute university college cork irelandabstract--hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cog- nitive behaviors are regulated by a number of factors includ- ing stress inflammation and exercise.

although it has been demonstrated that exercise can reverse the negative impact of stress on adult hippocam- pal neurogenesis and memory   it is unclear if such effects generalize to the counteraction of the negative effects of il-1b .adolescence is a critical period for maturation of the hippocampal circuitry  and heightened neu- rogenesis  as well as a key period for susceptibility to stress and the emergence of psychiatric disorders 0306-4522c 2017 ibro.

exercise reversed the combined effects of stress and il-1b overexpression only in certain cases such as object recognition and both the number of surviving neurons and number of newly born neurons.the finding that isolation housing stress during adolescence resulted in a reduction in the percentage of newly born cells becoming neurons in adulthood supports previous findings that the effects of stressor exposure during adolescence on hippocampal neurogenesis can be long-lasting for even up to 12 months .
