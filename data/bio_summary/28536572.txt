The changes that had been observed in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were reversed  and phage treatment reduced the level of the genus Enterococcus and family Enterococcaceae that were observed in the challenge mice to a level similar to that in the normal mice  and Supplementary Figure S5.

At predetermined intervals bacterial counts were determined in 10 ul of peripheral blood obtained from the caudal veins of mice that were treated with either EF-P29 or buffer.1 To verify the effect of phage therapy on the health of the mice body weight was measured initially weekly and at the end of the experiment in all of the mice    .

The ability of EF-P29 to protect the bacteremic mice was investigated using colony counting.

The mice were scored for their state of health on a scale of 5 to 0 based on disease progression at 24 h after treatment with a specific therapy.

The investigator was blinded to the group allocation during the experiment and when assessing the outcome.Gut Microbiota AnalysisFemale Balbc mice aged 6-8 weeks old were used in the experiments.

The mice in the EF group were challenged i.p.

The mice in the EF P group were challenged with 002 as in the EF group and then injectedi.p.

with 4 105 PFU of EF-P29 after 1 h. The mice in the Pgroup were injected i.p.

The mice that were treated with EF-P29 4 105 PFUmouse at 1 h after inoculation exhibited a drop in blood bacterial counts that reached approximately 3.8 log units at 24 h after treatment with EF-P29 .

The composition of the gut microbiota in the feces of challenged and normal mice that were treated with or without phage EF-P29 was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing n  6 for each group.
