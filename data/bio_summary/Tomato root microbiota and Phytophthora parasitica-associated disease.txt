A total of 322 OTUs exhibited significant differences p  0.05 in relative abundance between M1 and M2 Additional file Figure S3 with 49 OTUs defined by an average of at least 10 sequences in M1 or M2 data not shown.Our results suggest that the presence of oomycete on root surfaces led to an enrichment of sequences assigned belonging to Bacteroidetes 33 - 10.8 45 - 5.2 for M1 and M2 respectively and a reduction in the proportion of sequences assigned to the phylum Proteobacteria 63 - 10.1 52 -3.9 for M1 and M2 respectively.

At wound sites  the oomycete material would constitute a boarding gate for bacteria of this family to gain access to nutrients.ConclusionsSignificant changes in microbiota composition during the oomycete plant infection were identified.

Phytophthora parasitica has been shown to exploit intraspecific zoo- spore communication to improve adhesion to host cells and to express a set of effector and mucin-like genes by means of biofilm formation  .A first analysis of the microbiota dynamics in relation tooomycete infections has been carried out in fish A meta-taxonomic analysis of Saprolegnia-associated fish egg diseases indicated a correlation between a low incidence of saprolegniasis on salmon eggs having an immature adap- tive immune system and a high richness and abundance of specific commensal Actinobacteria with species from the Frondihabitans genus inhibiting attachment of Saprolegnia to eggs In the case of plant infections the oomycete- microbiota interactions interfacing with the disease cycle are scarcely documented  In this report we sought to explore changes in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota following infection of tomato roots by P. para- sitica.

To test whether there is a subset of the rhizosphere microbiota able to interact with oomycete and affect plant disease onset a first aim was to characterize composition and specificity of the rhizopheric microbiota having the ability to colonize biofilms.

The present study further illustrates an aspect of cooperationbetween an oomycete and opportunistic bacteria by demonstrating that oomycete infection extends the habi- tat availability for Pseudomonas spp.

As a matter of fact all these phyla are known to characterize a number of rhizosphere microbiota  indicating that the microbiota we stud- ied have the same overall content as that of other rhizo- sphere microbiota.

Nevertheless our results suggest that oomycete infection may facilitate op- portunistic infection by Pseudomonas spp.

The first as- sumption has been evaluated at the transcriptomic level through the analysis of gene expression of targeted genes recruited for structural functions or by brute force and stealth modes of infection No influ- ence of the bacteria-oomycete interaction was observed on the mRNA abundance of genes during the oomycete infection process.

Screening of root-biofilm complex M2 led us to characterize members of Pseudomo- nadaceae one of the ten most abundant families of the microbiota OTU affiliation rate of 3.7 and isolates of Enterobacteriaceae a family representing a low part of M2 microbial diversity OTU affiliation rate of 0.009 data not shown.

However different microorganisms growing in the rhizosphere may exhibit anti-germinative properties against plant-pathogenic oomycetes - while some inter-specific interactions may promote plant infection - or may contribute to oomycete propagule dissemination .
