Overall the bacterial communities were mostly dominated by Firmicutes 42.5 of the total sequences and 72 of different OTUs followed by Bacteroidetes 21.5 sequences and 13.9 OTUs Proteobacteria 11.5 of total sequences and 2.6 of OTUs Candidate Division TM7 7.7 of sequences and 3.4 of OTUs Actinobacteria 2.5 of total sequences and 2.8 of OTUs and Planctomycetes 6 of sequences and 1.5 of OTUs.

Of the several hundred breeds of sheep identified by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization three breeds of sheep are commonly kept as livestock in Saudi Arabia namely Najdi Noaimi Awassi and Harrei Harri sheep Supplementary Figure 1.

In consequence we argue that ruminant feces which are often analyzed for the search of microbial genes involved in plant cell wall degradation are probably a poor proxy for the lignocellulolytic potential of the host.Keywords sheep intestinal microbiota taxonomic diversity carbohydrate-active enzymes CAZymes shotgun metagenomics small intestine large intestine rectumINTRODUCTIONThe digestive tract of humans and animals is home to a diverse ecosystem of trillions of microbial cells Qin et al.

Lactobacillus genus Firmicutes was also highly represented in small intestine of Najdi sheep with 29 of total sequences Supplementary Table 3.Samples derived from the large intestine and rectum of the Noaimi sheep had very similar taxonomic profiles at both phylum and order level.
