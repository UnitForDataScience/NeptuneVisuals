Little change in the common environ- ment C was observed between the full and cohabit- ation sample analyses Additional file Figure S11.We compared phenotypes deemed to be heritable in our study 44 traits with Benjamin-Hochberg corrected P values of less than 1 with phenotypes seen to be herit- able in 5 studies of gut - and 1 in dental plaque We found that 14 of the 44 traits were mentioned with heritability estimates of at least 1 in one or an- other study though none showed high statistical signifi- cance Additional file Table S16 Additional file Supplemental Methods.

Descriptions of all traits can be found in Additional file Tables S11-14.Intraclass correlation coefficientThe MZ and DZ ICC values were calculated using the R package 'irr' icc command  and were compared using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum test function in the R package 'stats' wilcox.test The ICC values were cal- culated for all taxonomic groups that were categorized to be treated as continuous traits 24 taxonomic groups Additional file Tables S4 and S11.

A power ana- lysis shows that our sample is well powered to model continuous traits but is underpowered for categorical traits Additional file Figure S9.

In addition the ICC values for the remaining 17 continuous traits were de- termined Additional file Tables S4 and S11.ACE twin modelingThe ACEADE univariate twin modeling used the OpenMx package as implemented in R   see Additional file Supplemental Methods.

We conclude that cohabitation does not play a significant role in the observed microbiome heritability.To quantify the differences between groups the Cohen's D effect size was calculated for all b-diversity measurements Additional file Tables S1 and S2 for both the full sample and the sample limited to twin pairs who were cohabitating Cohen 1992.

The variation in estimates may reflect environmental ef- fects or loss of power between the full sample n  752 twin pairs and the cohabitating sample n  588 twin pairs Additional file Figure S9.

The unique envir- onment E accounted for most of the variation of the traits tested in both the full and cohabitation sample Additional file Figure S11.

Using these phe- notypes we identify promising host gene candidates in a genome wide association study of an separate sample that may play a role in establishing the oral microbiome.MethodsSample selection and DNA extractionTwin samples were obtained from the Colorado Twin Registry Rhea et al.

Cohen's D effect size for b-diversity measure- ments was calculated using the R package 'effectsize' command 'cohen.d' .Categorization of microbial traitsMicrobial traits included taxonomic groups OTUs a-diversity measurements and principal coordinates from b-diversity measurements Additional file Tables S11-14 collapsing all perfectly correlated traits.

For the 6 highly heritable continuous traits that were analyzed both with and without substance use covariates results appear to be consistent with and without substance Additional file Figures S15 and S16.DiscussionWe have shown that microbe abundance and some as- pects of the microbial population structure are influ- enced by heritable traits in saliva.
