The exact cause of HAEC is not fully understood but distur- bances of intestinal microbiota have recently been reported in patients with HAEC.

However the exact mechanism of action of probiotics therapy for HAEC is yet to be fully understood and the benefits of probiotics for HAEC are not clear.

reported markedly decreased Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in HAEC patients and speculated that this may result in a decrease in epithelial barrier function and be a predisposing factor in the development of HAEC.

HAEC is reported to occur in 6-50 of patients preoperatively and in 2-35 postoperatively.

In recent years the administration of probiotics has been proposed to reduce the incidence of HAEC.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of probiotics on postoperative HAEC.

The incidence of HAEC withwithout probiotics was22.6 and 30.5 respectively but this was not statistically different OR 0.72 95 CI 0.37-1.39 P  0.33.

ConclusionThis study shows that the administration of probiotics was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of HAEC.
