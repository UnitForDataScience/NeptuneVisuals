results were also compared to modern amazonians and modern europeans.putative gut resistomes of pre-incainca and italian nobility mummiesthe putative gut resistomes of the pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies were compared to those of modern amazonians and europeans to understand putative antibiotic-resistance patterns that could potentially provide insights of a gut resistome prior the antibiotic therapy era.

quinoa- and sweet potato-associated sequences were exclusively present in the pre-incainca culture whereas sequences associated with wheat were exclusively present in the italian nobility mummies figure a. when sequences were classified as a plant- or animal-based diet the pre-incainca culture was characterized by having a higher number of sequences associated with a plant-based diet whereas the italian nobility was characterized by having a higher number of sequences associated with an animal-based diet when compared to the pre-incainca consistent with the archeological evidence figure b.figure 2. relative proportions of plant and animal sequences identified in the guts of pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies.

sequences associated with alpaca and llama were found to be exclusively present in the pre-incainca culture whereas sequences associated with goat pig and sheep were primarily present in the italian nobility mummies.sequences associated with crops such as corn potato and tomato were present in both the pre-incainca and italian nobility with the exception of ferrante i of aragon mummy nasd22 mummified guts with a higher number of hits present in the pre-incainca mummies.

all of the measures indicate a higher alpha diversity within the italian nobility mummies compared to the pre-incainca mummies nonparametric two sample t-test bonferroni adjusted p  0.01.the gut microbiota of the pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies are significantly different anosim p  0.014 with data clustering according to culture as shown with both the heatmap figure a and the procrustes plot supplementary figure s3.

the italian nobility mummies exhibited a higher bacterial diversity as compared to the inca mummies when using 16s ribosomal rrna gene amplicon sequencing but both groups showed bacterial and fungal taxa when using shotgun metagenomic sequencing that may resemble both the thanatomicrobiome and extant human gut microbiomes.

contigs were uploaded to metagenomic rapid annotations using subsystems technology mg-rast and annotated using the kegg database with a minimum identity of 80 and an e-value of 10 x 10-5.in the context of enzymes that are associated with diet and metabolism genes encoding for cazymes involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates  identified in the pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies were further compared to those of modern amazonians and european gut metagenomes.

the proteobacteria accounted for 19.5 58.8 22.6 and 8.5 of the gt in the pre-incainca italian nobility modern amazonians and modern italians respectively figure .figure 4. carbohydrate-active enzymes cazyme gene diversity in the pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies guts.

the pre-incainca 3.29 had a higher proportion of the contigs that were assigned to putative antibiotic-resistance genes when compared to the italian nobility 1.58 yet this proportion was less compared to modern amazonian 4.96 and modern europeans 3.65. only the percentage of putative antibiotic-resistance genes identified in the italian nobility mummies and modern amazonians met statistical significance anova p  0.015. sequences that were associated with putative vancomycin-resistance and multidrug transporters were the most abundant in both the ancient and modern cultures figure a. other putative antibiotic-resistance genes that are present in the ancient and modern cultures included fosfomycin- chloramphenicol- aminoglycoside- macrolide- sulfa- quinolone- and tetracycline-resistance figure a. statistically significant differences were noted between several of the groups depending on the putative antibiotic-resistance category.

pairwise statistically significant correlations p  0.001 of chloramphenicol-resistance with taxonomic assignments are shown with asterisks  figure b. no other significant correlations were noted in the italian nobility mummies.figure 5. putative resistome profiles of the pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies.

alpha diversity between the pre-incainca and italian nobility mummies was as compared using the comparealphadiversity.py script with default parameters including a nonparametric two sample t-test and using bonferroni correction.
