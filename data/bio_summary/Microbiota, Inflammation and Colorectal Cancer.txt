These studies show a major role of the microbiota in protecting the gut integrity.Modulation of Immune SystemThe gut microbiota contributes to the maturation and modulation of both mucosal and systemic immune systems via innate immune components not much specific such as the pattern recognition receptors PRRs expressed on the different cell types in the mucosa enterocytes polynuclear cells mast cells macrophages and dendritic cells and adaptive immune components which are highly specific receptors expressed on the surface of T cells and B cells.

These two sites are enriched in microfold cells M cells which allow the translocation of bacteria that can be captured by dendritic cells and presented to naive T cells leading to the activation of B cells and therefore the secretion of IgA .

During inflammation the recruitment of innate immune cells such as macrophages neutrophils and dendritic cells and adaptive immune cells such as T and B cells leads to the secretion of oxygennitrogen reactive species which are highly genotoxic  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin IL-6 IL-8 IL-1b and tumor necrosis factor-a TNF-a as well as growth factors .

Experiments using human epithelial cells have shown that pks-harboring E. coli strains are able to induce senescence of infected cells which is accompanied with ROS production release of pro-inflammatory mediators and also production of growth factors such as the hepatocyte growth factor which have the ability to promote the proliferation of neighboring uninfected cells .
