These metabolites are chemically and in many instances functionally distinct from the dietary form and such features highlight their bioactivity .Maximum levels of phenolic metabolites in plasma are reached 1-2 h after consumption in the case of conjugated metabolites derived from the absorption in the small intestine and between 6 and 24 h for metabolites produced by the gut microbiota.

At the systemic level potential cardio- and neuro-protective effects of polyphenols have been described as well as a beneficial role in the prevention of some types of cancer diabetes inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders -.It is accepted that a two-way interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota exists so that not only is the gut microbiome involved in the metabolism of wine polyphenols but also the phenolic compounds and their microbial metabolites may impact on gut microbiota and induce prebiotic-like effects on bacteria.

The advent of promising dietary approaches linked to wine polyphenols beyond the gut microbiota community and metabolism are also discussed.Keywords wine polyphenols flavonoids gut microbiota microbial phenolic metabolites inter-individual variabilityIntroductionAmong polyphenol-rich food wine--and in particular red wine--has attracted great interest from the scientific community especially since different epidemiological and randomized clinical intervention trials such as the International MONICA MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease study  and more recently the PREDIMED PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterrenea Project  revealed that moderate wine consumption as part of a healthy diet and a lifestyle is associated with protective effects against relevant chronic diseases.
