By contrast the root communities of non-angiosperms are poorly characterized to our knowledge only a few studies describe the root communitycomposition of non-seed and non-flowering plants-.Here we extend the scope of plant host lineages to non-seed lycopods and ferns and seed plant phyla gymnosperms and angiosperms through investigation of the root microbiomes of 31 plant species in 25 families and 19 orders.

With evidence that plant age can affect root microbial communities all sampled plants were mature individuals of perennial or biannual species.We collected 470 samples 235 root and 235 associated bulk soil from 31 plant species across six plant communities Fig.

From these comparisons we predict that a global core set of plant root microbiota will be considerably more restricted than the list provided in the present study Table and Supplementary Table 3.ConclusionWe identified significant correlation between root community composition and host phylogeny in a survey encompassing plant species from multiple plant phyla growing in close proximity.

ARTICLE DOI 10.1038s41467-017-00262-8OPENEvolutionary conservation of a core root microbiome across plant phyla along a tropical soil chronosequenceYun Kit Yeoh1 Paul G. Dennis2 Chanyarat Paungfoo-Lonhienne2 Lui Weber3 Richard Brackin2 Mark A. Ragan4 Susanne Schmidt2  Philip Hugenholtz1Culture-independent molecular surveys of plant root microbiomes indicate that soil type generally has a stronger influence on microbial communities than host phylogeny.

The chosen chronosequence has a phylogenetically diverse flora composed of ancient and modern plant lineages and a con- siderable overlap of plant species between communities facilitat- ing the goal of distinguishing host and soil determinants of root microbial communities.

Relationships among the major plant phyla are indicated by a cladogram to the left of the figurewere also largely comparable between plant orders except for the eudicot Dilleniales Hibbertia scandens with consistently lower scores relative to other eudicots Supplementary Fig.

The significant correlation found in the present study between root-associated bacterial communities and hostphylogeny across a wide range of plant species suggests that root microbiomes have evolved with their plant hosts at least since the divergence of lycopods 400 million years ago.

These findings suggest that a core root bacterial community was established before the evolution of modern plant lineages and root-associated bacterial communities have evolved with their plant hosts.

The chronosequence exhibits progressive and retrogressive vegetation succession from which we selected multiple plant species representing diverse lineages of the plant kingdom.

The rainforest plant community receives similar rainfall but differs in rarity orabsence of fire compared to the other fire-prone sclerophyll plant communities.Sample collection.
