The overwhelming majority of studies support the view that probiotics prevent inflammation and carcinogenesis.181921 In contrast a recent study reported that concurrent treatment with VSL3 enhanced tumorigenesis in an AOMIl10-- mouse model.22 Furthermore the specific mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of probiotics on CAC have not been fully investigated.Bifico capsules were approved as an over-the-counter drug by the Chinese regulatory authority the State Food and Drug Adminis- tration in 2002.23 Previous research has shown that Bifico could relieve gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori and ameliorate experi- mental colitis caused by DSS in mice.2425 However the effect of Bifico on CAC has not been studied yet.The goal of the present study is to evaluate the protective efficacy of Bifico capsules against AOMDSS-induced CAC in mice.
