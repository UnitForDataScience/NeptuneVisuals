An exception was the amount of CA which was highest with SW high level of b- glucans Pb.05.The highest amounts of the group II secondary BAs LCA DCA and HDCA were exhibited by the group fed SW 191 547 and 256 mg respectively while the group fed Hadm revealed the lowest amounts of LCA and DCA compared with the other test groups and the control.Comparison between low- and high-fat dietsThere were significant interactions between the low- and high-fat diets in most groups especially concerning those fed SW and cellulose  .The total amount of BAs in the cecum of rats was higher with low- fat diets than with corresponding high-fat diets.

The design of the study resulted in eight groups of rats four fed low-fat and four fed high-fat diets of which six were test diets and two control diets.

The amount of the secondary BAs lithocholic- deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets Pb.05.

The colored marks represent all investigated parameters for each rat where triangles show low-fat diets   low-fat control LF-control  LF- 50Hadm  LF-Hadm  LF-SW and circles show high-fat diets   high-fat control HF-control  HF-50Hadm  HF-Hadm  HF-SW.

Concerning the group II secondary BAs LCA DCA and HDCA these were similar or lower with low-fat diets compared with high-fat diets.The levels of specific BA in groups fed low- and high-fat diets are shown in .

In contrast most of the primary and the secondary BAs ursodeoxycholic acid and b- and o-muricholic acids were two to five times higher Pb.05 in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets.

Rats fed low-fat diets containing barley were located on the left side of the plot and rats fed high-fat diets and the low-fat cellulose diet were on the right.

The levels of these BAs were higher in high-fat groups and correlated positively with Bacteroides fragilis and nega- tively with Clostridium leptum.DiscussionThe aim of this study was to determine which barley variety and DF levels such as b-glucan affect the cecal BA composition in low- and high-fat diets by using a rat model.

The total cecum amounts of a- b- and o-MCAs were higher when rats were fed diets with a low-fat content than high-fat.

Hadm diet contained a higher amount of barley flour 481 gkg dwb than SW 299 gkg dwb but the same amount of DF which means that this diet contains the highest amount of non-b-glucan DF.In the high-fat diets the primary BAs CA CDCA and a-MCA and the group I secondary BAs UDCA b-MCA and o-MCA were also as in the low-fat groups considerably higher in groups fed 80 g DFkg dwb of Hadm and SW compared with the group fed 50 g DFkg dwb 50 Hadm and the control .
