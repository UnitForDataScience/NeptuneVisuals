whereas severe neutropenia and gut mucosal damage are more or less experienced by all cancer and sct patients there is emerging evidence that those patients with profound disturbances in gut microbiota populations are at higher risk for developing blood- stream infections .what role does the gut microbiota play in the development of these enteric-derived infectionsone beneficial function of the gut microbiota is promoting colonization resistance to patho- gens a process by which the host's commensal gut bacteria prevent pathogenic bacteria from colonizing the intestine .

tlr toll- like receptor myd88 myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88.should we be monitoring gut microbiota populations in cancer and sct patientswith the widespread use of advanced gut microbiota profiling tools such as 16s rrna sequencing or metagenomic shotgun sequencing mss the question is whether clinicians should be using real-time monitoring of gut microbiota populations in these patients.

perhaps in the future active monitoring of gi microbiota populations followed by a more targeted manipulation of the gut immune system and gut microbiota populations to either prevent or treat infections or gvhd could become standard of care for cancer and sct patients .schema of potential novel approaches to reducing bacterial and fungal infections in cancer and stem cell transplant sct patients.fmt fecal microbiota transplantation gi gastrointestinal.referencesmiranda ln van der heijden im costa sf sousa ap sienra ra gobara s et al.

an increase in gut microbiota relative abundance does not necessarily correlate with an increase in total microbiota levels.

in preclinical models emulating the development of gut-derived bacter- emia and fungemia all 3 host defense mechanisms need to be impaired to promote microbial dissemination from the gut antibiotics to deplete gut commensal microbiota allowing high levels of pathogenic microbial colonization i.e.

furthermore recent studies have now shown that cancer and sct patients with significant disruptions in gut microbiota com- munities are at increased risk for developing invasive infections  and the posttransplant complication known as graft-versus-host disease gvhd -.

these data suggest that the primary variable that determines which cancer or sct patients will develop gut-derived microbial bloodstream infections may be those who have significant gut microbiota perturbations resulting in increased levels or bur- den of pathogenic bacteria or fungi.

these data suggest that complete eradication or absence of coloniza- tion is not needed to achieve a significant decrease in dissemination.overview of commensal gut microbiota modulation of colonization resistance to pathogenic bacteria and fungi.

a commensal gut microbiota induces the intestinal antimicrobial peptide regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma regiiig which has activity against gram-positive bacteria including enterococcus via a tlrmyd88-dependent mechanism .

antibiotic therapy can deplete commensal gut microbiota thereby resulting in decreased levels of regiiig and a concomitant increase in enterococcus colonization .

b commensal gut microbiota particularly the bacteroidetes and clostridial firmicutes induce intestinal production of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1a hif-1a which in turn regulates production of the antimicrobial peptide ll-37cramp which has activity against candida albicans .

bacterial qpcr however will not provide a snapshot of the entire gut microbiota population and thus the clinician will be limited to following levels of the specific bacterial qpcr tests offered by the clinical micro- biology laboratory.

these data suggest that new antibiotic-independent approaches to prevent or treat invasive microbial infections in these patients are needed.what are the host factors that prevent bacteria and fungi from disseminating from the gutthe major host immune deficits that promote bacterial and fungal translocation from the gi tract include deficiencies in cellular immunity particularly neutropenia impaired intestinal barriers an adverse consequence of cytotoxic chemotherapy also referred to as mucositis and gi microbiota imbalance often driven by use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

when antibiotics are given that deplete commensal microbiota particularly commensal anaerobes gi amp production decreases pathogenic microbial colonization increases and the risk of dissemination increases .

not surprisingly fecal microbiota transplantation or more precise probiotic therapy can restore colonization resistance and thus decrease the risk of infection  .
