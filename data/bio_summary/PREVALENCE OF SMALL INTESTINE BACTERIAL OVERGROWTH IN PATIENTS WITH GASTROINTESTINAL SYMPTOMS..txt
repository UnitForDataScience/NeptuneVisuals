For greater uniformity in the interpretation of the results we included only the results of patients who underwent the test using glucose as a substrate excluding the results of those who took the test with lactulose as substrate.The results were reviewed and analyzed by the interpretation of the figures obtained from the excretion of H2 andor H2 and CH4 during the 2 hours that the test was performed.

Gender distribution and symptoms occurrence for test result of H2 exhale test employing glucose as a substrateTable 2 shows the distribution of gender and occurrence of symptoms resulting from the H2 and CH4 test.

Results - The results indicated a significant prevalence of small intestine bacterial overgrowth in the H2 test and in the test of exhaled H2 and CH4 56 and 64 respectively in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and higher prevalence in females.

A convenience sample which included all the results of the exhaled H2 and CH4 test held since the implementation of this breath test at the clinic for a year and a half 100 patients was used.

Similarly the same number of patient test results that only performed the exhaled H2 test during that same period selected consecutively and randomly 100 patients was also evaluated.

We selected 100 results of patient tests who only performed the exhaled H2 test and 100 patient results who underwent the exhaled H2 and CH4 test in the same period.We found that the H2 and the H2 and CH4 exhalation tests were performed predominantly in women accounting for 66 and 72 of samples respectively.It was observed that 56 results 56 of exhaled H2 breath tests were positive for SIBO.

We also observed the difference of the baseline value and the maximum peak of exhaled H2 which ranged between 12-85 ppm in these analyzed results.The analysis of the test results from patients who underwent the exhaled H2 and CH4 test showed that 64 patients 64 tested positive for SIBO.

The occurrence of symptoms during the test was significantly associated with the test result P- value 0.000 indicating that among patients with a positive result the proportion of those with symptoms 80.4 was significantly higher than among patients with negative results 40.9TABLE 1.

Due to the increased cost and complexity for carrying out the jejunal aspirate the gold standard for diag- nosis of the syndrome routinely the hydrogen H2 breath test has been used utilizing glucose or lactulose as substrate which is able to determine in the exhaled air the H2 concentration produced from the intestinal bacterial metabolism.
