The mechanisms by which the microbiota influence Uhrf1 HDACs and other epigenomic modifiers in T cells are only starting to be uncovered and represent an exciting new area of research.Epigenomic pathways directed by the microbiota maintain intestinal epithelial barrier functionIn addition to immune cells increasing data is emerging that support epigenomics as a potent mechanism by which the microbiota impacts intestinal epithelial cells IECs.

Microbiota-dependent regulation of epigenomic pathways in intestinal epithelial cells The microbiota provide signals to the intestinal epithelium that contribute to effective intestinal barrier function.

Given that the most critical period for microbiota colonization and establishment occurs during the first few years of life this data provokes the idea that early exposure to the microbiota may mediate essential epigenomic regulation in immune cells that could prevent or predispose to disease later in life.Microbiota-derived signals epigenetically regulate T cell differentiationPeripheral Tregs are generated from naive CD4 cells programmed to express the lineage- defining transcription factor forkhead box P3 Foxp3 58.

Although further studies are needed to test how epigenomic pathways mediate crosstalk between the microbiota the CNS and ENS these recent findings suggest that intersection of the microbiota and host epigenomics represents a potentially profound level of regulation in the nervous system.Conclusion and PerspectivesCollectively recent work has revealed substantial ties between the microbiota and epigenomic regulation in mammalian cells.

Close association between the microbiota and the single layer of intestinal epithelial cells IECs that line the intestine are also necessary to regulate essential biological processes such as metabolism nutrient uptake neuronal development and angiogenesis 6- 8 Epigenomic modifications are central mechanisms involved in directing transcriptional response to environmental cues and thus represent a potentially significant interface by which the microbiota can dynamically interact with the host genome.

1.Similar to ILCs invariant natural killer T cells iNKTs respond to signals from the microbiota produce effector cytokines and activate adaptive immune cells 56.

1 Neonatal exposure to a complex microbiota establishes CpG methylation patterning in intestinal stem cells that are linked to stem cell renewal and IECdifferentiation 76.

When exposed to butyrate intestinal stem cells exhibited increased levels of histone acetylation along with impaired epithelial proliferation and repair 79.Within the host IECs initial studies have supported that expression of HDAC epigenomic- modifying enzymes mediate microbiota-dependent intestinal homeostasis.

The authors demonstrated a microbiota- dependent DNA methylation patterning in intestinal epithelial cells at genes associated with intestinal development.
