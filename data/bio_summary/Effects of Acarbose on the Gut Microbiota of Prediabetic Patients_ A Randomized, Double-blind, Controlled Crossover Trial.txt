These carbohydrates will be fermented by microbiota which will change the composition of the intestinal microbiota significantly as was shown in the present study.Indeed many of the OTUs that greatly increased in response to acarbose belong to short chain fatty acid SCFA-producing taxa such as Faecalibacterium Prevotella and Lactobacillus.Compared with baseline levels the abundance of Lactobacillus increased significantly with acarbose which may be due to its high tolerance to the low pH environment that is maintained by the enhanced fermentation of gut microbiota .

We have previously shown that FINS concentration was negatively correlated with the diversity of gut microbiota suggesting that insulin resistance may affect the composition of gut microbiota.

However the response of gut microbiota to acarbose is important as the microbiota may have a critical role in the development of metabolic diseases andX.

We explored the changes in the proportion and diversity of gut microbiota before and after treatment with acarbose in patients with prediabetes.Methods We designed a randomized double-blind controlled crossover trial in which 52 Chinese patients with prediabetes by an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT with a BMI of 18-35 kgm2 were randomly allocated to treatment with acarbose or placebo.

However the reason why acarbose confers additional benefits besides its antidiabetic effect remains unknown.The composition and activity of the gut microbiota codevelop with the host from birth and is subject to a complex interplay that depends on the host genome nutrition and lifestyle.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is involved in host metabolism by increasing energy extraction immune system modulation and altering lipid metabolism which play an intricate role in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes  .

We even observed changes in the proportion and diversity of gut microbiota in the early prediabetes period .

As acarbose is metabolized exclusively within the gastrointestinal tract principally by intestinal bacteria and digestive enzymes we hypothesize that modulation of gut microbiota may contribute to one of the mechanisms mediating its antidiabetic effect and confer additional benefits.

To test this hypothesis we designed a randomized double-blind controlled crossover trial in which the clinical effects and the changes of gut microbiota before and after treatment with acarbose and placebo were compared.METHODSSubjectsIn this study we screened men and women aged between 30 and 60 years who had a body mass index BMI of between 18 and 35 kgm2 by a baseline 75-g oral glucose tolerance test OGTT in Beijing China and enrolled 52 participants 21 male and 31 female with prediabetes according to WHO criteria 1998 .

Trial Registration Chinese Clinical Trial Register number ChiCTR-TTRCC-13004112.DesignThe study was a randomized double-blind controlled crossover trial in which the clinical effects and changes of gut microbiota in response to acarbose and placebo were compared.
