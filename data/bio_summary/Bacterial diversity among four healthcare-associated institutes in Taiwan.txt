However a more comprehensive measure of diversity and the factors that determine the diversity and composition of the environmental microbiomes in HCIs are poorly understood.Recently the development of culture-independent high-throughput molecular sequencing approaches has transformed the study of microbial diversity in different hospital locations as demonstrated by the recent explo- sion of research in the microbial ecology of neonatal intensive care units ICUs respiratory care centers and medical ICUs .

To evaluate the amount of diversity contained within communities alpha diversity analysis was performed through phyloseq R package version 1.19.1to generate the Observed Chao1 and Ace richness and Shannon diversity indices.

This approach readily determines several orders of magnitude more microbial diversity than culture-based methods and has dramatically altered our understanding of microbial diversity.

Even though the diversity and composition of the surface microbiome in an individual HCI has been determined there have been few attempts to comprehensively survey the factors that determine the HCI microbiome.Currently the composition and diversity of microbiomes in a built environment are contributed to by two ecological processes dispersal resources and the selection of certain microbial taxa by environmental condi- tions.

Table shows alpha diversity in workplaces high-touch areas and envi- ronments in the four HCIs and the areas with the highest diversity are the workplace and environment for SC.To further explore the relationships among the different bacterial communities in the four HCIs a PCoA analysis using a weighted Unifrac distance matrix was performed and the result is shown in Figure .

Fourth multiple factors including ventilation type might contribute to the differences in diversity among the four HCIs based on our findings.Our results indicate a much higher diversity of communities in the four HCIs using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

To determine the amount of diversity shared between two communities beta diversity Unifrac distances were calculated between all pairs of samples.

The factors that determine the diversity and composition of microbiomes in a built environment remain unclear.

The observed relationship between environmental parameters such as core microbiota and surface bacterial diversity suggests that we might manage indoor environments by creating new sanitation protocols adjusting the ventilation design and further understanding the transmission routes of HAPs.Humans live in health-care institutes HCIs during periods of hospitalization.
