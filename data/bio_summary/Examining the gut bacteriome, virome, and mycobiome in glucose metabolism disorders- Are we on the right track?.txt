It was suggested that the microbiome of the meconium of infants born to mothers with GD was enriched with the same bacterial taxa reported in the fecal microbiome profile of GD patients such as the Bacteroides Parabacteroides and Lachnospiraceae which have been repeatedly reported as predominant in T2D patients .When overweight insulin-resistant women who had demon- strated in the past GD were evaluated at eight months postpartum a decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Prevotella spp.

Depending on the host age physiology environment and genome gut bacterial depletion may lead to either a temporary pro-inflammatory gut microbiome profile that starts the athero- sclerotic process or a more stable prolonged gut microbiome profile that leads to metabolomic abnormalities of the gut ecology maintaining the vicious circle of obesity and T2D.

The human microbiome project strategy for comprehensive sampling of the human microbiome and why it matters.

Metagenomics contributed to the characterization of the microbiome taxonomy leading to the understanding of transorganismal behaviors .

To do so a systematic research was performed by employing the terms 'Type 1 Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes gesta- tional diabetes and prediabetes' and 'gut microbiome bacteriome mycobiome virome' in humans accordingly in PubMed EBSCO Google Scholar databases and the ResearchGate site.complement of the gut community measured via laboratory metagenomic techniques .

Human gut microbiome includes the bacteriome and the virome assemblages of the bacteria and viruses respectively that reside in the human gut and the mycobiome a term used to describe the fungal genome in the human gut .

The human gut microbiome is usually characterized by its species richness qualitative classification of gut microorganisms and its species evenness quantitative evaluation of each species.

The combined species richness and evenness in ecological terms is expressed as gut microbiome diversity .During the past decade human gut microbiota has been implicated as a causal or contributing factor in the pathogenesis of many clinical entities such as inflammatory bowel disease cancer cardiovascular diseases sepsis asthma obesity insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus .

Consequently a substan- tial amount of studies regarding gut microbiome rapidly ensued.Diabetes encompasses all the hyperglycemic states.
