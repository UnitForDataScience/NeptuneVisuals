Kashyap Purna and Eamonn Quigley provide a timely and informative review covering clinically relevant aspects of the gut microbiome.

tight junction proteins and their regulators to produce gut pathologies -- indeed the review covers an area that has not received much attention till now.

His research interests are in enteric neurobiology and motility -- his focus is to better understand the role of gut purines in health and disease and explore the potential of 'purinergic drugs' for GI diseases and disorders such as IBD IBS and postoperative ileus.

Emerging areas include pharmacogenomics the interaction between pharmacotherapy and gut microbiome special diets i.e.

low FODMAPs purinergic drugs opioid mechanisms of drug tolerance and constipation and microRNA's.Review in Gastroenterology of costsmorbidity associated with gut disorders and diseases provide a sobering reality of the magnitude of the problem and underscore the need for more options for treatment.

The next generation of small molecules with potential for oral administration and intestinal drug delivery may have advantages over biolo- gics and these are being considered for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.. highlight the role of purinergic signaling in the normal gut enteric neuropathies and GI diseases.

Purines regulate all levels of gut motor reflexes.

Work from Gulbrensan's lab provides evidence that glia release ATP which contrib- utes to neuron death and gut motor dysfunction in colitis via a P2X7-dependent neural-glial pathway and a glial purinergic-connexin-43 pathway.

An interesting new development is that the gut microbiome may be a contributing factor in opioid tolerance to analgesia.

The concept is forwarded that chronic morphine administra- tion alters the gut microbiome and disrupts the epithelial barrier by causing intestinal inflammation.
