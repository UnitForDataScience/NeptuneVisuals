Activation of GPBAR1 in the L cells induces the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 which may decrease appetiteand stimulate pancreatic insulin production.Gut microbiota convert primary bile acids to secondary bile acids and therefore has a potent impact on bile acid signal- ling.In humans the primary bile acids are cholic acid CA and chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA which are converted to secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid DCA lithocholic acid LCA and ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA by the gut micro- biota.

Deconjugated cholic acid CA is converted to deoxycholic acid DCA by 7-alpha-dehydroxylase chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA is converted to lithocholic acid LCA by 7-alpha-dehydroxylase CDCA is converted to ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA by 7-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSDH.

Primary bile acids such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid cDca are produced in the liver and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid Dca and lithocholic acid by gut microbiota.

Despite different trends in per cent bile acid distribution between the groups the absolute concentrations of all bile acid species were increased in NASH serum .Hepatic expression of genes related to bile acidsAltered serum bile acid levels prompted us to examine the differ- ential hepatic expression of genes related to bile acid metabo- lism  using a thoroughly characterised and validated microarray data set from NASH and control livers.

CA cholic acid CDCA chenodeoxycholic acid DCA deoxycholic acid NASH non-alcoholic steatohepatitis UDCA ursodeoxycholic acid.with the elevated expression of genes required for bile acid synthesis and transportation increased HNF4A expression was observed by both microarray  and qRT-PCR .

Elevated serum total bile acids in NASH were first reported by Ferslew et al.Using approaches that are complementary to ours Mouzaki et alconcluded that bile acid production is elevated in NAFLD livers based on the findings that faecal total bile acid and faecal primary bile acid levels are elevated in patients with NAFLD and that serum marker of bile acid synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten- 3-one is elevated in NAFLD.

It was shown that ileal bile acid malabsorption caused by deficiency in ASBT gene leads to repressed FXR activity in enterocytes and through reduced FGF15 expression influ- ences hepatic bile acid metabolism.Similar effect is observed when bile acid availability is reduced by enhanced bile acid HepatologyFigure 5 Altered microbiome composition in the gut of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH.

In contrast mouse gut micro- biome favours FXR signalling by reducing muricholic acid one major primary bile acid that is FXR antagonistic.Conversely secondary bile acids DCA and LCA are more potent agonists for GPBAR1 than CDCA and CA.The multifaceted impacts of bile acid signalling on liver metab- olism suggest that the gut microbiome may be a target for the therapeutic intervention of NAFLD.

Since NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome our observation of elevated bile acid production in NASH is in harmony with the elevated bile acid production in patients with obesity diabetes and metabolic syndrome.Previous studies arrived at contradictory conclusions regarding bile acid production in NAFLD.

Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease naFlD pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile acid signalling in naFlD.Design Serum bile acid levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 FgF19 liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with naFlD high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Results Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with naFlD.
