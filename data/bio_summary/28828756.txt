To understand the complex interactions of the microbiota of bacterial wilt-diseased banana plants we first determined the bacterial communities residing in the pseudostems of infected symptomatic and diseased-free non-symptomatic banana plants.

Several characteristics of plants ben- eficial microbes in controlling the phytopathogens are high competency for ecological niches or substrates ability to synthesize bacterial allelochemicals and ability to induce systemic resistance in their host plants to a broad spectrum of pathogens Compant et al.

Taxonomic classifications revealed 17 and nine known bacterial phyla in the tissues of non-symptomatic and symptomatic plants respectively.

Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria accounted for more than 99 of the 16S rRNA gene fragments were the two most abundant phyla in both plants.

In Malaysia major diseases of banana plants are bac- terial wilt Fusarium wilt Yellow and Black Sigatoka and Cordana leaf spot Mokhtarud-din and William .

.Based on the symptoms observed on banana plants inMalaysia this disease is very similar to the Moko diseasewhich originated in Central America.

Studies and surveys conducted by the Department of Agriculture Malaysia in 2014 indicated that R. solanacearum phylotype IV and BDB caused BW disease of banana plants in Malaysia Timin et al.

The current concept in microbial plant dis- eases suggested synergistic interactions of microbiomes in plants can occur leading to disease complexes.

Thus as a first step towards understanding the microbe-plant interaction ofthe BW-diseased banana the objective of this study was to determine the diverse bacterial populations in banana Musa paradisiaca cultivar Nipah plants with sympto- matic and without non-symptomatic diseased symp- toms by employing a 16S rRNA metagenomics approach.
