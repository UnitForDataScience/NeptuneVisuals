if antihypertensive drugs such as ace inhibitors were prescribed to an individual with gm already producing ace inhibitors would these be less effec- tive to treat htn than in an individual without these gm do inter-individual antihypertensive responses vary depending upon the background gm can the gm metabolize drugs differently depending upon the composition of the gm  is resistance to development of htn in some individ- uals due to a particularly beneficial combination of gm and raas could ace2's antimicrobial peptide activity be exploited to correct dysbiotic colonic gm populations answers to these questions could greatly potentiate the ability to prescribe effective antihypertensive agents.genetic models of ace2 expression in micemice with global overexpression of ace2 ace2 ki are re- sistant to anxiety .

for exam- ple could bacteria viruses or fungi escape into the systemic circulation to trigger immune responses to precipitate htn might there be a htn signature of bacterial fungal or viral dna expressed in the serum of hypertensive patients that could be used to predict and treat hypertension could the dysbiosis of htn create a unique profile of metabolites in the blood that could be similarly used can gm diversity between individuals result in different metabolism of antihy- pertensive drugs such that effective or resistant drug re- sponses are driven by differences in gm composition .

this review aims to summarize recent advances in the field illustrate the connections between the gut and hypertension and establish that the gut microbiota gm-gut interaction is centrally posi- tioned for consideration as an innovative approach for htn therapeutics.recent findings animal models of htn have shown that gut pathology occurs in htn and provides some clues to mech- anisms linking the dysbiosis gut pathology and htn.

finally dysbiosis of the gm has recently been linked to met- abolic htn  htn during obese pregnancies  life- time risk of developing htn  and found in pre- hypertensive as well as hypertensive populations of asian descent .

taken together these studies indi- cate that chronic systemic inflammation resulting from im- mune activation is associated with htn dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the consequent immune responses likely con- tribute to this inflammation.the gm is remarkably stable in the adult   but is malleable in early childhood  so environmental or life- style changes in adulthood are unlikely to manipulate the gm to cause a long-term outcome like htn.

could for example an undernourished mother pass epigenet- ic markers to her offspring that predispose to a gut-gm- immune-brain interaction favoring htn development is the gut microbiome truly as stable over the lifespan as it appears from the limited studies reported or could htn modify or be modified by changes over the lifespan therefore perinatal and early life conditions influence the risk of developing htn and this may occur through modulation of the establishment of the gut-immune brain axis.

cortisol binds two receptors to have pro-hypertensive actions the mineralocorti- coid receptor and in the absence of 11hsd2 to the glucocor- ticoid receptor .the htn resulting from gm-mediated synthesis of aldo- sterone was prevented by antibiotic knockdown of the gut microbiota in rodents  illustrating the important role of the gm in htn.

nonetheless these data suggest that gut ace2 is involved in regulation of the gm in a way that could interact with htn as obesity and insulin resistance are risk factors for metabolic htn.

gm dysbiosis accompanies htn in rodents    and alterations in the human gm occur in the prehypertensive state .

ace2 acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by increasing ang1-7 and decreasing ang ii content of the colon and has important beneficial effects in some diseases of the gut such as colitis .interactions between the gm and the gut raas that relate to htnproduction of raas activators and inhibitors by the gmsome symbiotic bacteria produce ace inhibitors renin inhib- itors and antioxidant molecules during the digestion of mu- cin thus gm dysbiosis could trigger htn as reviewed in .

essentially the gut raas and gm interact and dysbiosis affects htn by modulating the gut raas.some interesting questions arise when considering interac- tions of gm and raas.

however we are far from understanding whether this is a cause or conse- quence of htn and how to best translate this fundamental knowledge to advance the management of htn.

effective treatment paradigms are urgently needed for htn especially for rhtn and the causes of htn are poorly un- derstood in many particularly those with rhtn.

connections between the gut and htn are further suggested by the important inter- actions of the gut and its contents with the immune system the afferent and efferent portions of the autonomic nervous sys- tem pre-autonomic brain areas and the enteric nervous system ens and the renal axis  all of which become dysregu- lated in htn.

systemic immune system dysregulation is a hallmark of htn in animal models and humans  and neuroinflammation in blood pressure-relevant brain areas has been demonstrated in animal models of htn .
