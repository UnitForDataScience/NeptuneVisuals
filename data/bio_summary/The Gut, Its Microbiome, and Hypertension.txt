If antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors were prescribed to an individual with GM already producing ACE inhibitors would these be less effec- tive to treat HTN than in an individual without these GM Do inter-individual antihypertensive responses vary depending upon the background GM Can the GM metabolize drugs differently depending upon the composition of the GM  Is resistance to development of HTN in some individ- uals due to a particularly beneficial combination of GM and RAAS Could ACE2's antimicrobial peptide activity be exploited to correct dysbiotic colonic GM populations Answers to these questions could greatly potentiate the ability to prescribe effective antihypertensive agents.Genetic Models of ACE2 Expression in MiceMice with global overexpression of ACE2 ACE2 KI are re- sistant to anxiety .

There are circadian and seasonal rhythms to the GM but in general the GM is considered imperturbable.

GM dysbiosis accompanies HTN in rodents    and alterations in the human GM occur in the prehypertensive state .

Taken together these studies indi- cate that chronic systemic inflammation resulting from im- mune activation is associated with HTN dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the consequent immune responses likely con- tribute to this inflammation.The GM is remarkably stable in the adult   but is malleable in early childhood  so environmental or life- style changes in adulthood are unlikely to manipulate the GM to cause a long-term outcome like HTN.

The GM is an importantcomponent depleting the GM of mice with antibiotics induced changes in host serotonin biosynthesis and intestinal motility .

ACE2 acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by increasing Ang1-7 and decreasing Ang II content of the colon and has important beneficial effects in some diseases of the gut such as colitis .Interactions between the GM and the gut RAAS that Relate to HTNProduction of RAAS Activators and Inhibitors by the GMSome symbiotic bacteria produce ACE inhibitors renin inhib- itors and antioxidant molecules during the digestion of mu- cin thus GM dysbiosis could trigger HTN as reviewed in .

Further metabolic activity of the GM may explain the pro- hypertensive actions of stress in some of the population if we hypothesize that they have a GM dysbiosis that inhibits the breakdown of cortisol by 11HSD2.

Essentially the gut RAAS and GM interact and dysbiosis affects HTN by modulating the gut RAAS.Some interesting questions arise when considering interac- tions of GM and RAAS.

For exam- ple could bacteria viruses or fungi escape into the systemic circulation to trigger immune responses to precipitate HTN Might there be a HTN signature of bacterial fungal or viral DNA expressed in the serum of hypertensive patients that could be used to predict and treat hypertension Could the dysbiosis of HTN create a unique profile of metabolites in the blood that could be similarly used Can GM diversity between individuals result in different metabolism of antihy- pertensive drugs such that effective or resistant drug re- sponses are driven by differences in GM composition .

The gut microbiome GM interacts with the immune system of the host to educate it as germ-free mice have a defective immune system .
