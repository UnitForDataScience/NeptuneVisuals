The program was as follows denatur- ation at 95C for 3 min followed by 49 amplification cycles of 95C for 15 s 58.5C for 20 s and 72C for 15 s. A melt curve was generated to verify the specificity of amplification from 65C to 95C with an increment of 0.5C per cycle with each cycle held for 5 s. The primer sequences are provided in .

The plant microbiome is important for growth promotion and disease suppression.

The results showed that the microbial population and its relative abundance in the asymptomatic roots was far higher than that in the symptomatic roots and that many microorganisms in asymptomatic roots have biological control and plant growth promotion functions that may be related to clubroot symptoms.

Compared to the rhizosphere and the rhizoplane the endosphere is highly specific in terms of the microbial communities that it con- tains .The plant microbiome has been identified as an important determinant of plant health .In its capacity to do harm the microbiome contains many plant pathogens such asCompeting interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.Magnaporthe oryzae Sclerotinia scleroterum Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium sp.

The frequency of bacterial isolates possessing various plant-beneficial properties was higher in asymptomatic citrus plants affected by Huanglongbing than that in symptomatic citrus plants .
