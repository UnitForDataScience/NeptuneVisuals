The overall objectives of this review are to 1 define the significance of the microbiome and the gut microbiome-liver hypothesis 2 discuss the microbial products that may significantly impact hepatic metabolism and 3 pro- vide evidence of how different lifestyle modifications includ- ing diet exercise and aerobic fitness change the microbiome with discussion on the implications to NAFLDNASH.Microbiome Differences between Preclinical Models and HumansThroughout this review we will reference rodent pig and human microbiome studies and therefore deem it necessary to discuss the compositional and functional similarities.

Future studies such as microbiota transplant studies from HCR rats into LCR rats and vice versa or humanized transplant studies are warranted and will provide much needed proof of concept for the potential causative role of the microbiome in suscepti- bilityprotection of NAFLD related to changes witnessed with differences in aerobic fitness.Microbiome and Liver CancerThe incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC is in- creased with the progression of NAFLD to advanced cirrhosis and may be mediated through changes in the microbiome 116.

Interestingly NAFLD patients exhibit increased TLR-4 ex- pression in hepatic progenitor cells bile ducts and interlobular bile ducts 181 and hepatic inflammatory and fibrogenic signals appear to be TLR-4-mediated in Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells 150.

Interestingly calori- cally controlled fructose consumption in nonhuman primates caused signs of endotoxemia and liver injury without apparent changes in the microbiome 83 suggesting that fructose- induced gut dysbiosis may only happen in the presence of excess energy intake and may cause liver injury independently of the microbiome.

Overall this area provides future perspectives on targeting the microbiome throughout all stages of the disease including steatosis through cirrhosis and HCC.SummaryFigure 3 depicts the overarching principle of how progress- ing from a normal microbiome to dysbiosis may have a direct impact on the progression and severity of NAFLD.Fig.

In terms of microbiota composition HFD- induced changes on the microbiome in Ossabaw swine are similar to what is observed in humans 137.

Diet- induced obesityWestern style diet feeding causes severe microbial dysbiosis initiating a microbiome signature that promotes metabolite production that directly impacts hepatic metabolism.

Understanding the reshaping of the microbiome and the metabolites produced and their subsequent actions on hepatic metabolism are vital in understanding the gut-liver axis.

The microbiome changes in the pathological state of obesity and NAFLD suggest that overproduction of SCFA may contribute to hepatic steatosis by being a significant source of energy for the host however fermentation of certain dietary fibers yields SCFA at less metabolically taxing concentrations and therefore elicits benefits to host metabolism potentially through their actions on GPCRs and maintenance of epithelial immune homeostasis.

More recently dietary soy vs. milk protein has shown protective effects on Western diet-induced hepatic ste- atosis potentially linked through the microbiome.
