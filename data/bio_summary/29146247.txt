Among fungal and bacterial microorganisms we identified both potentially beneficial Cryptococcus Hanseniaspora Massilia Rhodotorula Sphingomonas and phytopathogenic microorganisms Cladosporium Pantoea Phoma Pseudomonas Septoria Taphrina indicating their important roles in ecological and evolutionary processes.IntroductionPlants host many microorganisms that colonize the surface of fruits leaves flowers and stems as well as within their tissues  .

The communities of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms on blackcurrants sampled in Lithuania and the Czech Republic were clearly separated in PCoA plots from each other and from apples .Composition of apple bacterial and fungal microbiotaThe populations of fungal and bacterial microbiota at the phylum level were similar on both apples AppleLT and AppleCZ collected from the geographically distinct regions of Lithuania and the Czech Republic.

The analysis of distribution of fungal microorganisms on blackcurrants harvested in Lithuania revealed that the most dominant genera were Cladosporium 45.4 and Cryptococcus 15.2 while the berries collected from the Czech Republic were dominated by Hanseniaspora 48.5 followed by Cladosporium 5.2 and Rhodotorula 1.5 B see Supplementary Table S2 in the online version at DOI .DiscussionThe distribution of microorganisms depends on plant species and may be affected by growing ripening and storage conditions  .

but were detected after isolation from both apple samples by applying enrichment and cultivation techniques see Supplementary Table S3 in the online version at DOI .Composition of blackcurrant bacterial and fungal microbiotaThe distribution of fungal microorganisms at the phylum level was similar on blackcurrant berries located in both Lithuania and the Czech Republic.

However on the blackcurrant berries harvested in the Czech Republic the most abun- dant bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria 71.8.The broad diversity and variation of bacterial and fungal micro- organisms among the blackcurrant samples harvested in Lithuania and the Czech Republic were evident at the family and genus level .Among the dominant bacterial OTUs Staphylococcaceae 27.1 Flavobacteriaceae 7.2 and Moraxellaceae 5.7 were the mostabundant families in BlackcurrantLT while the BlackcurrantCZ sample was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae 20.4 followed by Oxalobacteraceae 8.4 Pseudomonadaceae 7.8 Sphingomona-daceae 7.4 Comamonadaceae 7.0 Cytophagaceae 7.0 Acetobacteraceae 6.1 and Sphingobacteriaceae 5.4 A.

The current study evaluated the distribution of bac- terial and fungal microorganisms found on apple fruits and black-currant berries grown in distinct regions in Lithuania and the Czech Republic.

Eukaryotic I and prokaryotic II microbial community distribution at the phylum A and class B level.AppLT - apples sampled in Lithuania AppCZ - apples collected in the Czech Republic B. currLT - blackcurrant berries sampled in Lithuania B. currCZ - blackcurrant berries collected in the Czech Republic.and were analyzed immediately after sampling thus minimizing ex- ternal impact on the composition of microbiota.We found that the bacterial communities from the apple surface were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria mostly represented by the family Enterobacteriaceae.

The microorganisms on black- currants located in Lithuania differed at the lower taxonomic level family genus or species from berries harvested in the Czech Republic.

Taking into account that human pathogenic bacteria can adapt to plant hosts  there is a chance that such kind of bacteria were also present on the berries tested in our study.By focusing on the communities of fungal microorganisms weidentified Saccharomycetes to be the major class associated with apples in both locations and blackcurrants collected in the Czech Republic.
