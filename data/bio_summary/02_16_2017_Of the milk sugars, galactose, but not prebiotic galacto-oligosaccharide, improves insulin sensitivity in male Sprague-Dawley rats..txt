Approximately 100 ml blood was collected into heparin-con- taining tubes for future quantification of tracer and insulin.The clamp period 0 to 120 minutes began with an insulin bolus of 20 mU kg-1 min-1 for 2 minutes porcine insulin Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co. Oakville ON Canada followed by a continuous jugular infusion of 4 mU kg-1 min-1 insulin and 0.8 mCi kg-1 min-1 of 3-3Hglu- cose.

Stimulation of PGU by insulin was not affected by GAL  which means that all of the whole-body response to GAL can be attributed to an improved hepatic insulin sensitivity.

Vehicle- and insu- lin-stimulated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase did not differ  but insulin's abil- ity to suppress inhibitory phosphorylation of GS was significantly greater with GAL compared to GLC and FRC .DiscussionThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of milk sugars on insulin sensitivity when given at 15 of dry matter intake.

Although inefficient hepatic uptake of galactose from diets containing  30 galactose leads to hypergalactosemia that is used to mimic symptoms of diabetes  whether the preferential diversion of galactose intohepatic glycogen influences the sensitivity of glucose flux to insulin has not been investi- gated previously.Here we report that isocaloric substitution of galactose for glucose or fructose at 15 of dietary dry matter improved hepatic insulin sensitivity with no alteration in plasma glucose concentration.

found no difference between glucose fructose or lactose con- sumed at 15 of dry matter intake by young cattle in the QUICKI index of hepatic insulin sen- sitivity estimated from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.

The tendency for GAL to increase colonic proglucagon expression may provide a link between intestinal microbiome effects and improved insulin sensitivity although basal plasma insulin was not affected.In contrast to galactose galacto-oligosaccharides from milk are indigestible but exert prebi- otic effects which can increase colonic short-chain fatty acid production  and ameliorate high-fat diet induced endotoxemia thereby improving inflammatory status and glucose toler- ance .

Supplementing diets containing 72 of calories from fat with 10 oli- gofructose improved hepatic insulin sensitivity via increased insulin-stimulated phosphoryla- tion of IRS1 and Akt  along with increased intestinal proglucagon expression and noeffect on peripheral insulin sensitivity.

These results indicate that milk sugars particularly the galactose moiety of lactose has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity while the more com- monly consumed glucose and fructose had negatively affected insulin sensitivity.
