At the end of the rearing period Lachanospiraceae was significantly higher in LA birds in comparison to CON 17.07 vs 14.39 P  0.036 and the same trend was observed for Clostridiaceae 14.30 vs 11.89 P  0.074 .Overall among the first 30 bacterial species identified in one-day old chicks the most represented species were Lactobacillus johnsonii Lactobacillus crispatus Escherichia coli Rumi- nococcus torques Lactobacillus helveticus Lactobacillus gasseri Ruminococcus obeum Rumino- coccaceae bacterium D16 Clostrifium hylemonae and Eubacterium limosum .

At 41 days the most represented species in CON were Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Lactobacillus crispatus Ruminococcus torques Subdoligranulum variabile Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16 Lactobacillus johnsonii Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus Ruminococcus obeum Clostridium diffi- cile and Blautia hydrogenotrophica whereas in LA they were Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Lac- tobacillus johnsonii Ruminococcus obeum Subdoligranulum variabile Ruminococcus torques Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16 Lactobacillus reuteri Lactobacillus crispatus Blautia hydroge- notrophica and Clostrium leptum .

In relation to the bacterial species significantly dif- ferent among the tested groups  the relative frequency of abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus was significantly higher in one-day old chicks in comparison to LA whereas Mean relative frequency of abundance  of the 30 most representative species MRS of caecum bacteria in one-day old and 41-day old chickens untreated CON and treated with L. acidophilus LA.1MRS most represented speciesRuminococcus lactaris was significantly higher in one-day old chicks in comparison to CON.

Indeed it is well documented that the mode of action of Lac- tobacillus consists in competitive exclusion against harmful bacteria in the gut in favor ofMean relative frequency of abundance  abundance of the KEGG in caeca of day 1 chickens Day 1 and in ceca of chickens treated with L. acidophilus Treated in comparison to the untreated birds Control at 41 days.beneficial microbial populations leading to improvement in nutrients utilization of feed  .

The distribution of the top 20 metabolic functions among the 14 tested chickens showed slight differences only in one-day old chicks .DiscussionThe administration of probiotic Lactobacillus has been demonstrated to stimulate immune responses   and improve digestive health  as well as growth performance - in poultry.

After studying the effect of Lactobacillus species supplementation in chickens Award et al.attributed the improvement of growth performance of broiler chickens to the greater development of small intestinal villi particularly villus heightcrypt depth ratio in both duode- num and ileum.

The relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus was comparable between LA and CON groups.

Oxygen consumption by those bacteria drives the lower gut environment to more reducing conditions facilitating subsequent growth and colonization by extremely oxygen-sensitive obligate anaerobes -.The relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the caeca of LA chickens was compa- rable with that of CON group.
