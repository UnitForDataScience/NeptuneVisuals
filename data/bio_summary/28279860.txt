the toxin activity of r20291 and cd196 red bar was significantly greater than the toxin activity of all other strains m68 p  0.0001 cf5 p  0.001 bi9 p  0.0001 and m120 p  0.0001. interest-ingly the toxin activity of m120 red bar was significantly less than all other c. difficile strains r20291 p  0.0001 cd196 p  0.0001 m68 p  0.001 cf5 p  0.0001 and 630 p  0.0001.secondary bile acids alter tca mediated spore germination and outgrowth growth kinetics and toxin activity of clinically relevantc.

all c. difficile strains exhibit more than 70 spore germination and outgrowth with the addition of 0.1 tca except for strain 630 which exhibited less than 20 germination and was significantly different from all other strains r20291 p  0.001 cd196 p  0.001 m68 p  0.001 cf5 p  0.001 bi9 p  0.0001 and m120 p  0.001 in a. a potent inhibitor of tca mediated spore germination cdca significantly inhibited germination of all strains in a  tca 0.04 cdca gray bar.

however there are fewer studies showing how sbas alter all stages of the c. difficile life cycle spore germination growth and toxin activity of clini- cally relevant epidemic non-epidemic historic and more recent strains.past studies have shown that spore germination rates of clini- cally relevant c. difficile isolates varied when exposed to primary bile acid tca and cdca a known inhibitor of spore germination in vitro .

for strain m120 toxin activity was significantly increased at both concentrations of idca compared to its ethanol control.lithocholatespore germination and outgrowth of two cd196 and m68 out of the seven strains were significantly inhibited at 0.001 lca a. spore germination of r20291 decreased with both con- centrations of lca although it did not reach statistical significance.in the remaining strains cd196 m68 cf5 bi9 m120 and 630 spore germination was significantly inhibited with the addition of a higher concentration of lca 0.01. altered and diminished growth kinetics were present for all strains exposed to 0.001 lca except in strain 630 b. the growth kinetics of the higher concentration of lca 0.01 is not presented due to interference with od.

significance between positive controls and treatment groups for each strain in spore germination and toxin activity assays were calculated by student's parametric t-test with welch's correction e. statistical significance was set at a ptable 3growth rate and doubling times for c. difficile strains.value of 0.05 for all analyses  p  0.05  p  0.01  p  0.001 p  0.0001. spearman's rank correlation coefficients r were calculated for all pairs of terminal od and toxin activity at 24 h for each strain .resultsdiverse c. difficile clinical strains vary in tca mediated spore germination and outgrowth growth kinetics and toxin activityin this study all bile acids were dissolved in 100 ethanol so positive controls include the addition of ethanol without the addition of sbas to ensure that ethanol alone does not inhibitc.

although 0.02 dca diminishedgrowth kinetics the toxin activity was not reduced for m68 and m120 toxin activity was significantly increased c.isodeoxycholater20291 and m120 were resistant to both concentrations of idca0.01 and 0.1 and therefore did not exhibit any differences in spore germination and outgrowth when compared to the ethanol controls a. spore germination for cd196 m68 cf5 bi9 and 630 were significantly inhibited by 0.1 idca.

toxin activity for r20291 and m120 was unaffected by either concentration of umca evaluated.hyodeoxycholatehyodeoxycholate at 0.002 significantly inhibited spore germination and outgrowth for cd196 and all other strains were resistant a. when the concentration of hdca was increased to 0.02 cf5 and m120 were still resistant however spore germination was significantly inhibited in all other strains.

for strain m120 the toxin activity was unaffected by either concentration of hdca.discussionconclusionseven different gut microbial derived secondary bile acids dca idca lca ilca udca umca and hdca were tested at physio- logically relevant concentrations in vitro for their ability to differ- entially impact spore germination and outgrowth growth kinetics and toxin activity of seven clinically relevant and diverse c. difficile strains r20291 cd196 m68 cf5 bi9 m120 and 630. compari-sons of the effects of individual sbas between strains was not presented due to substantial differences in the baseline physiology of each strain tested .

difficile strains used in this study.spore germination and outgrowth assaythe spore germination and outgrowth assay protocol is modi- fied from carlson et al.

growth kinetics were not evaluated at 0.01 lca due to interference with optical density although the toxin is still active.isolithocholateisolithocholate at 0.01 did not inhibit spore germination and outgrowth of cf5 and m120 but it significantly inhibited at thehigher concentration 0.1 ilca a. spore germination in all other strains was sensitive to both concentrations of ilca.

however the higher concentration of udca 0.04 significantly inhibited spore germination of five strains r20291 cd196 m68 cf5 and 630. spore germination of strains m120 and bi9 were resistant to both concentrations of udca.

for instance all seven sbas significantly decreased spore germination and outgrowth of cd196 but only five of the seven sbas inhibited r20291 spore germination.

it is unknown how sbas inhibit tca mediated spore germination however the primary bile acid cdca inhibits germination via the germinant receptor cspc .
