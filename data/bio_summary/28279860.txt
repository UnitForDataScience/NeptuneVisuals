Toxin titers for all strains ranged be- tween 4 and 7 log10 reciprocal dilution toxin per 100 ml of C. difficile culture supernatant C. The addition of ethanol to growth media only affected the toxin activity of CD196 which showed significantly higher toxin activity compared to no ethanol.

When M68 was exposed to higher concentrations of DCA iDCA and UDCA its growth kinetics were diminished however the toxin activity in M68 was unaffected and paralleled its control C. These results support that toxin activity is not solely dependent on growth of C. difficile.C.

In general inhibition of toxin activity by SBAs significantly correlated with SBA induced alteration in C. difficile growth meaning that if the SBAs diminished C. difficile growth measured as terminal OD at 24 h then toxin activity was subsequently reduced .

Interest-ingly the toxin activity of M120 red bar was significantly less than all other C. difficile strains R20291 p  0.0001 CD196 p  0.0001 M68 p  0.001 CF5 p  0.0001 and 630 p  0.0001.Secondary bile acids alter TCA mediated spore germination and outgrowth growth kinetics and toxin activity of clinically relevantC.

For strain M120 the toxin activity was unaffected by either concentration of HDCA.DiscussionconclusionSeven different gut microbial derived secondary bile acids DCA iDCA LCA iLCA UDCA uMCA and HDCA were tested at physio- logically relevant concentrations in vitro for their ability to differ- entially impact spore germination and outgrowth growth kinetics and toxin activity of seven clinically relevant and diverse C. difficile strains R20291 CD196 M68 CF5 BI9 M120 and 630.

Although 0.02 DCA diminishedgrowth kinetics the toxin activity was not reduced for M68 and M120 toxin activity was significantly increased C.IsodeoxycholateR20291 and M120 were resistant to both concentrations of iDCA0.01 and 0.1 and therefore did not exhibit any differences in spore germination and outgrowth when compared to the ethanol controls A. Spore germination for CD196 M68 CF5 BI9 and 630 were significantly inhibited by 0.1 iDCA.

However there are fewer studies showing how SBAs alter all stages of the C. difficile life cycle spore germination growth and toxin activity of clini- cally relevant epidemic non-epidemic historic and more recent strains.Past studies have shown that spore germination rates of clini- cally relevant C. difficile isolates varied when exposed to primary bile acid TCA and CDCA a known inhibitor of spore germination in vitro .

Spearman's rank correlation coefficients r were calculated for all pairs of terminal OD and toxin activity at 24 h for each strain .ResultsDiverse C. difficile clinical strains vary in TCA mediated spore germination and outgrowth growth kinetics and toxin activityIn this study all bile acids were dissolved in 100 ethanol so positive controls include the addition of ethanol without the addition of SBAs to ensure that ethanol alone does not inhibitC.

The higher concentration of uMCA 0.04 minimally altered the growth ki- netics of all strains tested B. Additionally uMCA did not diminish toxin activity in any strain except strains CF5 and 630 which displayed a significant decrease in toxin activity when exposed to the lower 0.004 and higher 0.04 concentration of uMCA respectively C. Interestingly for strains M68 and 630 0.004 uMCA resulted in a significant increase in cultureFig.

Positive correlation of C. difficile growth with toxin activity measured at 24 h. Using Spearman's correlation r the terminal OD and toxin activity at 24 h were correlated for C. difficile strains in the presence and absence of SBAs.
