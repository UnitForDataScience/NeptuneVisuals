Moisander Department of Biology University of Massachusetts Dartmouth 285 Old Westport Road North Dartmouth MA 02747 USA.SummaryCharacterisation of marine copepod gut microbiome composition and its variability provides information on function of marine food webs biogeochemical cycles and copepod health.

If bacteria associate with copepod food seasonal shifts in copepod diet could also correspond with changes in the copepod gut bacterial microbiome.Variability in food sources may influence not only the passing but also the more stable gut bacteria Tang et al.

Persistent bacterial groups belonging to Firmicutes Bacteroi- detes and Actinobacteria were present in the copepod guts throughout the year and showed syn- chronous changes suggesting a link to variability in copepod nutritional content.

Studying seasonal changes in the copepod gut microbiome could reveal stable representatives important for copepod health.

The key objective was to identify transient and more permanent members of the copepod gut microbiome and to start identifying and examining potential variability of bacterial components originating both from copepod food and other sources.

Due to the high abundance of copepods in the marine environment the bacterial community com- position and activity in the copepod gut could have a significant impact on food webs and biogeochemical cycling of elements in the marine environment.ResultsThe study resulted in bacterial community data based on the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region for 42 copepod gut and 7 sea- water samples Fig.

can only be specu- lated Bernard and Funke 2012.Unlike the core members found in the copepod gut throughout the year 16S rRNA sequences indicated that there was only periodically a very high proportion up to 65 of Synechococcus or related picocyanobacteria in the copepod gut microbiome this was seen particularly in May and December samples.

2007.DiscussionPrevious studies on copepod associated bacteria from both coastal and open ocean waters have primarily focused on characterisation of the copepod exoskeleton or entire animal Huq et al.

The differences between the gut and the surrounding seawater could indicate that conditions are present inside of the animal that promote growth of these specific bacterial groups or could originate from consistent bacterial load in the copepod prey particles.The detection of bacterial groups in this study cannot speak to their relative activities however the presence of certain groups year-round in the gut samples indicates they are an important part of the copepod gut microbiome.

One of the most notable differences between the gut community and previous studies is the lower relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the copepod gut compared to the whole copepod.
