in addition to the gt genes exclusively present in the genomes of strains of b. uniformis the strains the b. uniformis cect 7771 and 3978-t3i strains exhibited the largest number of gt enzyme encoded genes 30 when compared with counterparts 25 genes per strain on average.

thus in species like b. vulgatus and b. fragilis which are considered as pathobionts wexler 2007 the number of these genes are abnormally lower than in other species this is particularly notable for b. fragilis which has almost half of genes found in b. uniformis strains.finally a searching for potential antibiotic resistance and virulence genes was completed by comparing the full set of orfs predicted to be encoded in the b. uniformis cect 7771 genome according to the proteins annotated in the ardb mvirdb and vfdb databases.

among the set of genes specifically associated with wbe see figure 5a n  10 we found an over-expression pattern for those encoding abc transporter proteins k02003 k02004 k2005 outer membrane protein k012538 and evidently genes encoding enzymes for xylan metabolism as beta-glucosidase k05349 xylose isomerase k01805 and beta-d-xylosidase k15920.inulinsimilarly to wbe inulin induced differential expression in a low number of genes.

functional categorization of genes with a trend to be over- expressed includes genes involved in glycolysis and galactose degradation as well as other genes involved in keratan sulfate chondroitin sulfate heparan sulfate dermatan sulfate d- galacturone and d-glucuronate degradation.

2009.bacteroides tethaiotaomicron is considered as the archetype for studies of sus genes and puls given the large number of genes encoded in its genome circumscribed to oligo and polysaccharide degradation function a trait that confers to this species a high versatility to degrade a wide variety of glycan compounds xu et al.

hierarchical clustering of genes differentially expressed in different culture conditions was achieved by using euclidean distance and average linkage methods metsalu and vilo 2015.quantitative pcrthe genes bunif77710387 bunif77710544 bunif77710548 bunif77711668 bunif77711883 bunif77713473 bunif77713732 and bunif77714131were selected from the exploratory rnaseq analysis to assess specific changes in expression by qpcr.

an additional kegg based functional analysis of orfs predicted to be encoded by the b. uniformis cect7771 genome has revealed the presence of a total of 24 genes corresponding to 11 different multidrug efflux pumps one d- alanyl-d-alanine dipeptidase vanx k08641 associated with vancomycin resistance and a couple of genes associated with cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance.b.

interestingly the gum arabic and mucin seem to induce and attenuate the expression of a larger set of genes in b. uniformis cect 7771. moreover both carbon sources similarly modify the expression of 152 out of 633 24 genes differentially expressed in all conditions inducing a similar response.

the functional annotation of the respective set of genes using the kegg modules indicates that gum arabic triggers a higher expression of genes involved in central metabolic functions such as reductive pentose phosphate and citrate cycles m00167 and m00173 respectively.

notably when the specific set of genes differentially expressed in gum arabic cultures see figure 5a n  13 was analyzed from the functional point ofview we disclosed genes encoding proteins and enzymes highly related with rhamnose metabolism such as l-rhamnose-h transport protein k02856 l-rhamnose isomerase k01813 and rhamnulokinase k00848.

interestingly inulin also trends to limit the expression of genes related to glutamate k00266 glutamine k01915 and asparagine k01953 biosynthesis as previously seen with wbe.pectinopposite to wbe and inulin the use of pectin as carbon source significantly induced the transcription of several genes across the b. uniformis cect 7771 genome.

other genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism whose expression was induced by pectin include the abc permeases and transporters k01990 k02003 k02004 glycogen phosphorylase k00688 alpha-n-arabinofuranosidase k01209 udp-n-acetylglucosamine 46-dehydratase k15894 glycosyltransferase epsj k19427 and the genes encoding enzymes involving in polysaccharide biosynthesis as the heptose iii glucuronosyltransferase k019354 and fuc2nac and glcnac transferase k13007.

2016 mazzoli and pessione 2016. the over-expression pattern observed for the glutamategaba antiporter k20265 could be another indication that pectin does induce production and release of gaba to the extracellular media by b. uniformis cect 7771. the genes encoding the glycosyltransferase epsj fuc2nac and glcnac transferase and the glutamate decarboxylase and glutamategaba antiporter appear to be specifically involved in the response to pectin fermentation by b. uniformis cect 7771. on the other hand signals for gene expression attenuation seem to affect predominantly the alanine aspartate and glutamate ko00250 and nitrogen ko00910 metabolism as well as arginine ko00220 and lysine ko00300 biosynthesis by down-regulation of the glutamate synthase nadphnadh large chain k00265 glutamate synthase nadphnadh small chain k00266 aspartate-ammonia ligase k01914 glutamine synthetase k01915 asparagine synthase k01953 diaminopimelate epimerase k01778 and ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase k10206 genes.mucinthe expression patterns of the b. uniformis cect 7771 genome as a consequence of mucin utilization comprised up-regulation and down-regulation of 423 and 115 genes respectively.

when we compared the respective and relative gene expression to that found in the presence of glucose we confirmed almost all the gene expression patterns inferred from the transcriptome analysis figure s2.gaba production by b. uniformis cect 7771once we corroborated the expression pattern observed for b. uniformis cect 7771 genes probably involved in gaba production by qpcr we further analyzed the gaba concentration in supernatants of cultures supplemented with mucin and pectin that showed a clear over-expression of glutamate decarboxylase bunif77710544 and glutamategaba antiporter bunif77710544 genes figure s2.
