Chassard et al.41 found increased Enterobacter concentrations in IBS patients and this finding was similar to that detected by Rigsbee et al.50 and Carroll et al.42 while Tana et al.40 found decreased Enterobacter in IBS patients.

All the included studies analyzed gut microbiota from fecal sample.Most of the included studies were age-matched and sex- matched and all of these studies detected gut microbiota in adult patients with IBS.

When it comes to the 10 Chinese studies two of the included studies confirmed microbiota alterations with qPCR3032 and the other eight included studies adopted culture- dependent approaches to characterize the bacteria counts of patients with IBS and healthy controls.

However the species-specific alterations of gut microbiota were different between IBS patients from China and other regions.IntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome IBS is one of the most common func- tional gastrointestinal diseases without any structural or meta- bolic abnormalities that sufficiently explain the symptoms which include recurrent abdominal pain discomfort and bowel habit changes such as diarrhea and constipation.1 However it doesn't exclude that there are microscopic changes such as gut microbiota alterations in IBS.

Preliminary study on intestinal flora in diarrhea type irritable bowel syndrome with pi-wei dampness-heat syndrome.

For example increased numbers of coliform bacteria have been detected by Matto et al.38 but Malinen et al.37 and Carroll et al.42 reported reduced numbers of E. Coli in IBS patients.

The standardized mean difference SMD with 95 confidence interval CI of bacterial counts was calculated.Results Ten studies from China and seven studies from other regions around the world were included in our study.

The inclu- sion criteria for the meta-analysis in our study were as follows i studies about patients with IBS ii adult participants iii studies about intestinal microbiota including luminal and mucosal typesiv healthy controls recruited v IBS and control groups being similar in age sex and geographical regions vi bacterial counts being expressed as log10 values per gram feces and vii data being sufficient to calculate the standardized mean difference SMD with 95 confidence interval CI in these two groups.

Any disagreement between investigators was resolved through discussion until consensus.The exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis were as follows i not case-control study ii child participants iii secondary analysis and iv studies with insufficient data unless the authors of these studies were able to provide adequate data.
