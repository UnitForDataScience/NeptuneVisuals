various levels of heterogeneity could be explained by differences in studyfigure 3 forest plots of alterations of gut microbiota in ibs patients versus healthy controls from other regions around the world a bifidobacteriab lactobacillus c escherichia coli d enterobacter e enterococcus and f bacteroides.figure 4 funnel plots of the included studies analyzing gut microbiota in ibs patients versus healthy controls from china a bifidobacteriab lactobacillus c escherichia coli d enterobacter e enterococcus and f bacteroides.figure 5 funnel plots of the included studies analyzing gut microbiota in ibs patients versus healthy controls from other regions around the world a bifidobacteria b lactobacillus c escherichia coli d enterobacter e enterococcus and f bacteroides.methodology sample size and criteria of ibs.

all the included studies analyzed gut microbiota from fecal sample.most of the included studies were age-matched and sex- matched and all of these studies detected gut microbiota in adult patients with ibs.

however the species-specific alterations of gut microbiota were different between ibs patients from china and other regions.introductionirritable bowel syndrome ibs is one of the most common func- tional gastrointestinal diseases without any structural or meta- bolic abnormalities that sufficiently explain the symptoms which include recurrent abdominal pain discomfort and bowel habit changes such as diarrhea and constipation.1 however it doesn't exclude that there are microscopic changes such as gut microbiota alterations in ibs.

in the context of ibs gut microbiota could produce variety of beneficial compounds such as short-chain fatty acids which might act as a barrier against pathogens by adhering to the mucosa.14 however gut bacteria fermentation may generate large amounts of gas and thus lead to ibs symptoms of bloating flatulence and abdomi- nal distension.1516the composition and metabolic activity of gut microbiota vary within individuals because of various factors including mode of delivery infant feeding dietary habits sanitation medicine illness and age.17 moreover the compositions of gut microbiota might vary across geographical regions.

however the credibility of funnel plots for publication bias was limited because the numbers of included studies for analyzing publication bias were less than 10.discussionboth experimental and observational studies around the world- wide had provided good evidences that gut microbiota alterations and lower biodiversity exist in patients with ibs and these changes potentially drive or perpetuate gastrointestinal symp- toms.4445 however there is no systematic review with meta- analysis exploring the alterations of gut microbiota in patients with ibs all over the world.

chassard et al.41 found increased enterobacter concentrations in ibs patients and this finding was similar to that detected by rigsbee et al.50 and carroll et al.42 while tana et al.40 found decreased enterobacter in ibs patients.

recently alterations of gut microbiota were proposed as possible causal factor for ibs.56 moreover it had been widely accepted that aberrations along the microbe-gut- brain axis are involved in ibs.7 in addition the frequency of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth by glucose hydrogen breathtest was found to be substantially higher in ibs patients 14-78 than in healthy controls 1-40 which might provide a unifying hypothesis that gut microbiota plays a role in the pathogenesis of ibs.89 moreover the incidence of new onset symptoms following acute infectious gastroenteritis might also suggest a microbiological cause for ibs.10gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem which may include over 1000 microbial species and 1014 cell about 10 times more than the number of human cells in the body containing 150-fold more genes than the human genome.1112 the microbi- ota can be defined as luminal and mucosal types and it was previously thought to comprise three predominant enterotypes bacteroides prevotella ruminococcus.13 gut microbiota might play an essential role in maintaining individual health.

we performed a mate-analysis to explore and compare the alterations of gut microbiota in ibs patients from china and other regions around the world.methods case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in ibs patients were identified through english and chinese databases.

studies were included if they were case- control studies detecting gut microbiota in ibs patients.

of the seven studies from other regions around the world three studies detected gut microbiota with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and other three stud- ies adopted culture method.

seven studies only analyzed gut microbiota in patients with diarrhea-predominant or constipation-dominant irritable bowel syndrome.20-26 of the 2154 english citations 1745 were irrelevant and 374 were duplicated.

when it comes to the 10 chinese studies two of the included studies confirmed microbiota alterations with qpcr3032 and the other eight included studies adopted culture- dependent approaches to characterize the bacteria counts of patients with ibs and healthy controls.
