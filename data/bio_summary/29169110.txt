The time of removing the left 23 part of kidney was recorded as the first week of modeling the next week ligaturing the right kidney was recorded as the second week of modeling.Table 119 kinds of aminoacids which have been tested in feces.No.NamesAbbreviationleucineleuphenylalaninephetryptophantrygamma aminobutyric acidgabamethioninemetvalinevaltyrosinetyrcysteinecysalpha-phenylalaninealathreoninethrglutamategluglutamineglnlysinelysserineseraspartic acidaspasparagineasncitrullinecitargininearghistidinehitSample collectionUrine samplesAt the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week rats were individually transferred to cleaned metabolic cages with free access to water but without any food to prevent con- tamination with proteins from food particles.

The urinary proteincreatinine ratio at the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week has shown in B.

The abundance of microbial strains which related to the degradation of proteins and the production of amino acids have been changed compared with sham which explains why there is a difference in the concentration of amino acids in the feces of the two groups of rats.56Nx rats' feces collected in 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week were tested by 16S rDNA sequencing.

Those signifi- cantly elevated genes may be responsible for the amino acid related indolep-cresol formation and accumulation further accelerate the development of CKD and form a vicious circle.In order to present the gradual change of the abundance of gut microbiota in 56Nx rats after modeling rat feces collected in 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week were tested by 16S rDNA sequencing.

16S rDNA sequencing and heatmap analysis for gut microbiota of the 56 nephrectomized rats' feces in 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week.

IS and PCS in plasma samples were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.Fecal samplesAt the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week feces were collected from the anus of the rat by means of oppres- sion.

24 h urinary protein excretion of sham operation group and the 56 nephrectomized rats at the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week.

B. Urinary proteincreatinine ratio at the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week.

The change of the abundance of gut microbiota was a gradual process the abundance of gut micro- biota in different week had different changes feces in 2 nd and 10 th week showed the most obvious difference.DiscussionCKD is a progressive pathological condition characterized by the progressive destruction of renal parenchyma and the loss of functional nephrons over time Various pathophysiological conditions including diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia obe- sity smoking and aging are risk factors for the progression of CKD Although the progression of CKD may depend upon the capacity of residual nephrons to overcome stress the mechanisms underlying the progression of CKD remain poorly understood Table 2Amino acid metabolism related genes which are significantly regulated in metagenomes.Although various animal CKD models have been reported rodent models tend to be more commonly employed in experi- mental CKD studies 56Nx rats model is a common model for studying the pathology of CKD which can reflect some physiological and pathological characteristics of CKD such as the accumulation of various metabolites.

Indole and p-cresol concentration in feces of sham operation rats and 56 nephrectomized rats at the end of the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week.Fig.
