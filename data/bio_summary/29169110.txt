those signifi- cantly elevated genes may be responsible for the amino acid related indolep-cresol formation and accumulation further accelerate the development of ckd and form a vicious circle.in order to present the gradual change of the abundance of gut microbiota in 56nx rats after modeling rat feces collected in 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week were tested by 16s rdna sequencing.

the abundance of microbial strains which related to the degradation of proteins and the production of amino acids have been changed compared with sham which explains why there is a difference in the concentration of amino acids in the feces of the two groups of rats.56nx rats' feces collected in 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week were tested by 16s rdna sequencing.

16s rdna sequencing and heatmap analysis for gut microbiota of the 56 nephrectomized rats' feces in 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week.

is and pcs in plasma samples were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.fecal samplesat the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week feces were collected from the anus of the rat by means of oppres- sion.

d. the disease score of sham operation group and the 56 nephrectomized rats' glomerular matrix.after four weeks 24 h urinary protein of two groups tended to be stable which indicate that the ckd model was successfully repro- duced a. the urinary proteincreatinine ratio at the 2 nd week 4 th week 6 th week 8 th week and 10 th week has shown in b. four weeks after nephrectomy there was a significant difference between sham and 56 nx groupp  0.05. the urinary proteincreatinine ratio tended to be stable after four weeks of modeling.the degree of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosisin order to evaluate the putative effects of nephrectomy on renal function histopathological changes in the renal sections of 56 nephrectomized rats were examined.

although exper- imental evidences suggest that the intestinal microbiota is able to incorporate and degrade some of the available amino acids it appears that the microbiota is also able to synthesize amino acids raising the view that amino acid exchange between the micro- biota and host can proceed in both directions whether the amino acid concentration increases or decreases all of these changes may be related to the progression of ckd besides trypto- phan and tyrosine phenylalanine is also an amino acid which can be used to produced is and the concentration of phenylala- nine was increased in the gut of 56 nx rats.

the above results showed that amino acids metabolism profile in 56nx rats appeared to be more and more disorder with the progression of ckd more amino acids have significant differ- ence between the two groups e which implied that gut microbiota producing these amino acids changed in 56nx rats.16s rdna sequencing in gut microbiota analysis and metagenome analysisusing r software clustering analysis on the abundance of top 50 genus and draw the heat map.

the change of the abundance of gut microbiota was a gradual process the abundance of gut micro- biota in different week had different changes feces in 2 nd and 10 th week showed the most obvious difference.discussionckd is a progressive pathological condition characterized by the progressive destruction of renal parenchyma and the loss of functional nephrons over time various pathophysiological conditions including diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia obe- sity smoking and aging are risk factors for the progression of ckd although the progression of ckd may depend upon the capacity of residual nephrons to overcome stress the mechanisms underlying the progression of ckd remain poorly understood table 2amino acid metabolism related genes which are significantly regulated in metagenomes.although various animal ckd models have been reported rodent models tend to be more commonly employed in experi- mental ckd studies 56nx rats model is a common model for studying the pathology of ckd which can reflect some physiological and pathological characteristics of ckd such as the accumulation of various metabolites.

there are more than 1000 types of gut microbiota in the level of genus so in order to study the dynamic changes of gut microbiota on the whole and to show the change of the gut microbiota intuitively the order level of gut microbiota were chosen and analyzed.

for example as reported in recent eppic trail although is and pcs was decreased by a kind of gut absorbant ast-120 no change in ckd progression has been observed is and pcs are prototypic protein-bound uremic toxin molecules which are not only biomarkers for renal function but0731-7085c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.also actively participate in the development of ckd progression they share some similarities including their production by gut bacteria strong albumin binding at sudlow ii site significant renal metabolism low dialytic clearance and an emerging role in cardiovascular disease and mortality in renal patients most of uremic retention solutes are derived from gut pro- tein and amino acid metabolism.
