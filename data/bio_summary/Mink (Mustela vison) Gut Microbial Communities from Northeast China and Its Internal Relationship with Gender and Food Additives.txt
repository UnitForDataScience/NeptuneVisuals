Comprehensive analyses of gut microbiota can contribute to understanding microbial interactions and biodiversity which is important in implementing strategies to improve gut health.Cultivation method was used as the major approach for microbial characterization for a long time.

Despite the extensive use of NGS in unraveling the function andimportance of the human gut microbiome there is cur- rently a lack of detail in biodiversity assessment using NGS to understand the topological differences and development of gut microbiota in mink intestines .

Further research will explore the relationship between other host genotypes and the gut microbiota community further revealing interaction mechanisms between gut microbiota and the host.Gut microbiota is crucial for breaking complex polysaccharides in mammalian digestion  and a detailed study of microbiota communities could identify a number of species that can degrade polysaccharides as novel discovery.

Almost all the bacterial species in gut microbiota can be quantified through 16S rRNAsequencing which has made this method into the main- stream -.Minks a kind of furbearing animals are commercially farmed to make colorful mink coats jackets and capes.

Furthermore they imply that a resident and stable micro- biota is hosted in the gut of mink after the findings of bacterial composition of male mink farmed in Denmark .

The major bacterial genus was Escherichia-Shigella while the low amount of Lactobacillus present was likely due to the relatively few dairy products included during feeding .The richness and structure of the gut microbiota were associated with gender and diet .
