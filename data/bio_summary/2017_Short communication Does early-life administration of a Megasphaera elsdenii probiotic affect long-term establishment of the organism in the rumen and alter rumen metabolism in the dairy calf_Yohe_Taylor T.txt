on d 14 calves in the m. elsdenii group orally received 25 ml of a commercially available m. elsdenii suspension whereas calves in the control group received 25 ml of the same product that had been autoclaved.

recent research involving m. elsdenii administration to calves has shown promise as m. elsdenii-dosed calves had larger and a greater number of rumen papillae muya et al.

calves were dosed on d 14 of the trial.port the narrative that lactipro administration leads to increased ruminal butyrate production.administration of m. elsdenii had little effect on the overall rumen microbiome composition as illustrated by principal coordinates analysis figure 2 but the ru- men microbiome composition showed temporal succes- sions as the calves grew.

the generation of m. elsdenii varies depending on the strain substrate and media but probably ranges from 170 to 400 min forsberg 1978. however the growth rate is probably much lower in the rumen than in the laboratory media which likely affected m. elsdenii es- tablishment in the rumen.in conclusion a single oral administration of lac- tipro a commercial m. elsdenii probiotic to 14-d-oldfigure 2. principal coordinates pc analysis of rumen microbiome.

lactate is not limiting in the rumen of very young dairy calves and it primarily contributes to the low rumen ph 5.0-6.0 reported for periruminant calves gentile et al.

because lactate is abundant in the rumen of young calves administration of m. elsdenii to increase butyrate production and thus promote calf ru- men development is an appealing possibility.

the main objective of this study was to determine whether m. elsdenii administration to calves via oral drench at 14 d of age affected its long-term establishment at 70 d post- administration.

six neonatal holstein heifer calves were blocked on d 1 by body weight 41.3- 1.8 kg and total serum protein 5.23 - 0.16 gdland assigned to either the m. elsdenii n  3 or control n  3 treatment groups.

the main objective of this pilot study was to determine whether oral m. elsdenii administration to dairy calves at 14 d of age would help establish a persistent population of the organism after dosing.
