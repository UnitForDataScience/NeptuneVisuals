On d 14 calves in the M. elsdenii group orally received 25 mL of a commercially available M. elsdenii suspension whereas calves in the control group received 25 mL of the same product that had been autoclaved.

Recent research involving M. elsdenii administration to calves has shown promise as M. elsdenii-dosed calves had larger and a greater number of rumen papillae Muya et al.

On d 14 calves assigned to PRO received 25 mL of a commercially available M. elsdenii suspension Lactipro MS Biotec Wamego KS and calves assigned to CON received 25 mL of the same product that had been autoclaved.

Control  calves received 25 mL of autoclaved Lactipro MS Biotec Wamego KS Lactipro  calves received 25 mL of nonautoclaved Lactipro a commercially available probiotic product of Megasphaera elsdenii.

Control gray shapes calves received 25 mL of autoclaved Lactipro Lactipro black shapes calves received 25 mL of nonautoclaved Lactipro a commercially available probiotic product of Megasphaera elsdenii.

The oral administration of M. elsdenii at 14 d did not increase the abundance of M. elsdenii 70 d postdosing alter rumen fermentation or change blood metabolites associated with butyrate.

However the growth rate is probably much lower in the rumen than in the laboratory media which likely affected M. elsdenii es- tablishment in the rumen.In conclusion a single oral administration of Lac- tipro a commercial M. elsdenii probiotic to 14-d-oldFigure 2.

Because lactate is abundant in the rumen of young calves administration of M. elsdenii to increase butyrate production and thus promote calf ru- men development is an appealing possibility.
