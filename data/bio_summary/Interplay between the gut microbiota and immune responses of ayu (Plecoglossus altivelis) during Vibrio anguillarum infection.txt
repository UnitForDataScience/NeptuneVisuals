The succession of V. anguillarum infection was evidenced by increased expression of immune genes and bacterial loads in ayu tissues which in turn altered the composition and predicted functions of gut bacterial community.

S1 the logarithm of the bacterial number 6.2 5.9 and 5.2 also known as bacterial load in liver was more than 105 CFU from 24 hpbc to 72 hpbc.

Thus the ayu gut bacterial assemblages were relatively stable at the coarse phylum level in response to infection.Responses of the gut bacterial community duringV.

Notably the gutbacterial communities were significantly associated with the expression levels of TNF-a Mantel test r 14 0.304 P 14 0.019 and IL- 1 b r 14 0.363 P 14 0.013.Identification of sensitive bacterial taxa for characterizing infectionGiven that gut bacterial communities were altered by sampling time and infection we determined whether sensitive taxa responded to infection in a similar pattern over sampling time.Fig.

This study investigated the gut bacterial communities and immune responses of ayu Plecoglossus altivelis upon exposure to Vibrio anguillarum.

The dynamics of gut bacterial diversity and evenness were temporally stable in control ayu but were reduced in infected subjects particularly at the late stages of infection.

The profiles of certain gut bacterial taxa were indicative ofV.

Compared with healthy controls the ayu infected with V. anguillarum possessed less complex fewer connected and lower cooperative gut bacterial interspecies interaction coinciding with significant shifts in keystone species.

These findings imply that V. anguillarum infection substan- tially disrupted the compositions and interspecies interaction of ayu gut bacterial community thereby altering gut microbial-mediated functions and inducing host immune responses.

In the present study we tracked the dynamics of ayu gut bacterial assembly in response to pathogen infection under a spe- cific time course.
