In conclusion caloric restriction induced uniform and consistent changes towards decreased gut permeability.To be able to distinguish between caloric restriction and weight loss we studied the participants after return- ing to a balanced weight-maintaining diet for two consecutive weeks.

Also sucralose used as colonic permeability marker significantly decreased during VLCD P 0.018 and increased again after caloric restriction P 0.019.In addition to sugar translocation we used PEGs translocation as an additional measure of gut permeabil-ity.

Then participants underwent a caloric restriction using a defined formula diet of 800 kcalday for 28 days.

Sucrose used as a proxy for gas- troduodenal permeability significantly decreased after caloric restriction P 0.012.

In contrast mannitol a marker for intestinal permeability did not change significantly during the 28 days of caloric restriction P  0.162.

All larger homologues of different chain lengths PEG25 PEG30 PEG35 and PEG40 significantly decreased after caloric restriction P  0.01 for each measurement but remained stable during the subsequent two weeks.

Adipocyte size before VLCD was 70.5 - 7.7 mm n 8 and decreased to 67.3 - 7.1 mm n  8 after caloric restriction without reaching significance P  0.38.

The relative abundance of members of the phylum Proteobacteria was significantly decreased after caloric restriction.

As expected the VLCD resulted in a significant decrease in body weight and fat mass as well as improvement of fasting blood glucose insulin HOMA-IR and lipid parameters.The primary objective was to study whether gut permeability which is reported to be impaired in obesity can be positively affected by caloric restriction.

Our findings based on a variety of methods indicate that a stand- ardised caloric restriction resulting in moderate weight loss significantly reduced gut permeability in particular paracellular translocation.
