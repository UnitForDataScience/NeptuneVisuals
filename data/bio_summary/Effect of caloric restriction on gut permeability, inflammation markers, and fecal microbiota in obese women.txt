Also sucralose used as colonic permeability marker significantly decreased during VLCD P 0.018 and increased again after caloric restriction P 0.019.In addition to sugar translocation we used PEGs translocation as an additional measure of gut permeabil-ity.

During the last two weeks of the study after returning to the habitual diet blood glucose significantly increased P  0.04 whereas insulin levels P  0.11 and HOMA-IR did not change significantly P 0.16.

However lean mass P  0.01 significantly increased and fat mass P  0.02 significantly decreased during the last two weeks.Caloric restriction improved metabolic and inflammatory markers transiently.

Sucrose used as a proxy for gas- troduodenal permeability significantly decreased after caloric restriction P 0.012.

In contrast mannitol a marker for intestinal permeability did not change significantly during the 28 days of caloric restriction P  0.162.

All larger homologues of different chain lengths PEG25 PEG30 PEG35 and PEG40 significantly decreased after caloric restriction P  0.01 for each measurement but remained stable during the subsequent two weeks.

Adipocyte size before VLCD was 70.5 - 7.7 mm n 8 and decreased to 67.3 - 7.1 mm n  8 after caloric restriction without reaching significance P  0.38.

In conclusion caloric restriction induced uniform and consistent changes towards decreased gut permeability.To be able to distinguish between caloric restriction and weight loss we studied the participants after return- ing to a balanced weight-maintaining diet for two consecutive weeks.

Fecal calprotectin did not decrease significantly after VLCD P 0.79.Markers of paracellular gut permeability decreased during VLCD.

P 0.001 P 0.01 P 0.5.Despite the significant weight reduction no significant decline in fat cell size of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was observed.
