assuming that placebo group would not experience any reduction in p-cresol level a difference of 2.4 mgml between the two groups corre- sponds to a 55 relative reduction in plasma p-cresol concentration after sev treatment.variables were synthesized as mean and standard devi- ation sd for numerical variables and using absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative data.linear mixed models were employed to assess the effect of sev on p-cresol and on the other evaluated laboratory parameters.

the primary end-point was to evaluate the effect of sev on p-cresol levels.results compared to baseline t0 7.4 - 2.7 mgml p- cresol mean concentration was significantly reduced in sev patients after one - 2.06 mgml 95 ci - 2.62 to- 1.50 mgml p  0.001 and 3 months of treatment - 3.97 mgml 95 ci - 4.53 to - 3.41 mgml p  0.001 no change of plasma p-cresol concentration was recorded in placebo-treated patients.

moreover p and ldl values were reduced after 3 months of treatment by sev but not placebo.conclusions in conclusion our study represents the first evidence that sev is effective in reducing p-cresol levels in ckd patients in conservative treatment and confirms its beneficial effects on inflammation and lipid pattern.keywords chronic kidney disease  p-cresol  sevelamer  cardiovascular riskintroductiondespite the significant advances in chronic kidney disease ckd treatment ckd-associated cardiovascular cv morbidity and mortality continue to rise this makes renal insufficiency a major public health problem .

once absorbed from the intestinal mucosa p-cresol is almost completely converted in its main metabolites p-cresylsul- fate pcs and p-cresylglucuronide two small molecules significantly bound to plasma proteins which are effi- ciently removed by the healthy kidney  unlikely they tend to accumulate in ckd patients either because of the well known modifications of gut microbiome of ckd that enhance p-cresol production  and the inability of the failing kidney to excrete it.

however whether sev lowers p-cresol in vivo too remains controversial since the only two studies performed in dialysis patients showed conflicting results   and the impact of the drug in non-dialysis ckd patients has been poorly investigated  .therefore the present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of sev in reducing p-cresol levels in ckd patients on conservative treatment.methodsstudy populationthis single-center prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the ckd clinic of the university federico ii of naples italy where 154 consecutive patients stage 3-5 were screened from march 2012 to may 2014 fig.

therefore what is measured by this method is mainly pcs.statisticssample size was calculated using total p-cresol as the main variable and assuming a power of 80 and a two sided alpha of 5. considering that plasma total p-cresol con- centration is about 5.3 mgml in stages 3-4 of ckd  and assuming a common standard deviation of 3 mgml we estimated that a minimum of 26 patients per group had to be enrolled to detect a 2.4 mgml difference in the concentration of this uremic toxin.

once absorbed from the gut p-cresol is transformed to p-cresyl-glucuronide and is further modified in the liver to p-cresyl-glucuronate which finally cumulates in the blood of uremic subjects where it exerts its proinflammatory effects on endothelial cells monocytes and lymphocytes .different studies have convincingly proven that sev directly absorbs both indoxyl-sulphate and urate  but the possibility that also p-cresol and pcs may bind to this drug remains controversial so far.

the only studies performed in human patients then showed con- flicting results in a series of 57 patients on maintenance hemodialysis 8-weeks treatment with sev paradoxically determined an increase in p-cresol levels compared to con- ventional phosphate binding regimens  whereas a cross- sectional observation in patients on peritoneal dialysis showed that treatment with sev was associated with lower p-cresol values than in lanthanum-treated patients or in untreated patients .

this probably does not occur in peritoneal dialysis patients in whom sev significantly lowers p-cresol and our present data strongly confirm the ability of sev to reduce this toxin also in ckd patients.our statistical analysis ancova excluded a possible association between p-cresol decrease and changes in hscrp ldl-cholesterol phosphate or pth during the study period.

moreover all the patients showed a remarkable stability over time in protein intake renal function and albumin concentration three variables potentially able to influence p-cresol metabolism in factan adequate protein intake is a limiting factor for produc- tion by gut bacteria of p-cresol   that circulates in plasma bound to albumin and is mainly removed from the blood by the kidney moreover we did not find any sig- nificant association between plasma concentrations of p- cresol and diabetes data not shown as suggested in pre- vious studies  .

this effect is due to the binding of bile acids to sev and their excretion in the gastrointestinal tract which leads to increased cholesterol catabolism and to the decrease in blood ldl-cholesterol without influencing hdl-choles- terol .these significant effects of sev were not associated with major adverse effects confirming the favorable safety profile of the drug  .we acknowledge that a limit of the present study is represented by the short follow-up period so we do not know whether in the long term the ability of sev in decreasing p-cresol is maintained moreover the patients of the present study had normal phosphate concentrations so it is not clear whether in presence of hyperphosphatemia the effects of sev on p-cresol still persist or are reduced by the increased binding of phosphate and consequently it is not clear whether doses of sev must be augmented to obtain similar results.

therefore therapeutic strategies to reduce plasma p-cresol levels are highly demanded.

it has been reported that the phosphate binder sevelamer sev sequesters p-cresol in vitro while in vivo studies on dialysis patients showed controversial results.
