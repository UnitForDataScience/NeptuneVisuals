Pathological examination showed that the amount of MNC mononuclear cells in the spinal cord of mice was lower than those in the control group which was not treated.Riccio and Rossano reported that diet can influence the severity of MS in both relapsing-remitting MS and pri- mary progressive MS.

These observations suggest that populations of effector cells and regulatory T Treg cells are involved in the pathogenesis of MS 53.Pantazou et al.

Although Chlamydia pneumoniae may be a pathogenic factor of MS it may simply be a secondary infection of damaged tissues of the CNS.CD40-CD154 interactions in the CNS are key determinants for the development and progression of the disease.Becher et al.

Gut microbiota may be of a great importance in the pathogenesis of MS since recent findings suggest that substitutions of certain microbial population in the gut can lead to proinflammatory state which can lead to MS in humans.
