biopsies of women with bv have also found that g. vaginalis and other bacteria asso ciated with bv form biofilms on vaginal wallss 1 2  n a t u r e  v o l 5 5 0  5 o c t o b e r 2 0 1 7 that resist breakdown perhaps explaining why bv is so persistent in some women.links between the vaginal microbiome and health outcomes should become clearer as more prospective studies follow women over time.

other antibiotics are being developed includ ing a product currently in clinical trials that would be a onedose treatment for bv.in the clinic the most common way of diagnosing bv is to use the amsel criteria in which three of four conditions must be met a vaginal ph above 4.5 less acidic than nor mal the presence of inflammatory cells called clue cells in the vaginal fluid a milky homo geneous vaginal discharge and a 'whiff test' based on the detection of a fishy odour when potassium hydroxide is added to fluid sam ples.

early results indicate that about 25 of the women have bv and low levels of lactobacillus.research on the vaginal microbiome islater she says should scientists isolate the most important components to make a manufactured product.ensign is currently working on the protocols for screening donors and for collecting freez ing and delivering samples of vaginal mucus to women who have bv.

the study will analyse blood and samples from the oral gut and vaginal microbiomes and will also survey women about their experience of chronic stress rac ism violence and abuse as well as their healthhealthy women to women with bv rather like the faecalmicrobiota transplants used to treat clostridium difficile infections.it's such a complex situation and there are things about the vaginal environment that we don't really understand ensign says.

fredricks says that the anaerobicgest that beyond being embarrassing bv and other forms of dysbiosis could compromise a woman's reproductive health.the improved understanding of the vaginal microbiome is also causing scientists to ponder the consequences of symptomless bv.

the dogma is that a lactobacillusdominated microbiome is more healthy than a complex microbiome says gregory buck principal investigator of the vaginal microbiome consortium at virginia commonwealth university in richmond.but as studies over the past decade or so have characterized the vaginal microbiome in greater detail they have complicated this simple view of what's healthy and what's not.

the depletion of lactobacillus is known as vaginal dysbiosisthese symptomless women healthy or does their vaginal microbiota put them at greater risk of health problemsrestoring a beneficial balance of microbes could be an important strategy for protecting women's reproductive health.

but to achieve that researchers will need to go beyond sim ply cataloguing which bacteria are present in the vagina and gain a fuller understanding of the connections between vaginal bacterial communities and women's health.the acid teststudies of the vaginal microbiota are showing how specific bacterial communities species and strains might influence reproductive health.

we need to be a lot more functional and look at the microbiota not just as the bacteria but what the bacteria are doing he says including their interactions with a woman's vaginal cells.chemical profiles of vaginal samples offersome clues.

the most common type of vaginal dysbiosis is a disorder called bacterial vagi nosis bv which can cause an unpleasant fishy odour and a watery discharge and this is more common in women of african ancestry.

we think there's a good chance it's caused by combinations of bacteria says buck.there are racial and demographic differences in terms of what is actually healthy.by fredricks analysed metabolites from 40 women with bv and 20 without to understand how the bacteria are changing the vaginal environment chemi cally.

the researchers will use a combina tion of dna sequencing and chemical analysis to identify factors that are potentially involved in premature deliveries including bacteria associated with bv.rebalancing actstudies are under way to improve the treat ment of bv by exploiting the growing under standing of the relationship between the vaginal microbiota and health.

researchers sometimes use a laboratory test called a nugent score in which a stain is added to vaginal fluid to make bacteria vis ible under a microscope because lactobacilli are a different shape from most bacteria that cause bv.

and sexual activity is a risk factor for bv suggesting that it can be transmitted from person to person although bv sometimes occurs in women who are not sexually active.jacques ravel a microbiologist at the uni versity of maryland school of medicine in baltimore led the 2011 study1 on ethnic dif ferences.

doctors already have protocols for diagnosing and treating bv but the treatments leave much to be desired.hilary reno an infectiousdisease physician at washington university school of medicine in st louis missouri sees many people with bv at her clinic for sexually transmitted diseases.
