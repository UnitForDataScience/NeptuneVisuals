All rights reserved.IntroductionEnzymatic transglycosylation involves the transfer of glycosyl units to the hydroxyl groups of aglycone or other glycosides by glycosyltransferase GTase EC 2.4 or glycoside hydrolase GHase EC 3.2.1 and is often used to improve the water solubility and stability of functional compounds .

Instead the kinetic parameters for sucrose as the sole substrate were divided at a critical sucrose concentra- tion 20 mM due to the presence of a second sucrose binding site .

Thus we concluded that this fluorescence-based transglycosylation assay using MU may have the potential to screen novel ASase var- iants with improved transglycosylation activities.ConclusionThis study presents the simple and easy fluorescence-based assay for the measurement of the transglycosylation activity of ASase using MU as an acceptor.

For determination of the Km of sucrose MU was held constant at 1 mM and sucrose was varied between 0.4 and 200 mM.

Hence kinetic studies of NPAS DGAS and DGAS-B were performed to determine the kinetic parameters with sucrose as a donor molecule and MU as an acceptor molecule.Reactions catalyzed by NPAS with MU and sucrose were moni- tored by HPLC.

The kinetic parameters for sucrose as a donor and MU as an acceptor were also separated at a sucrose concentration of 21 mM.

The overall performance kcatKm for sucrose concentrations lower than 21 mM was higher than that for sucrose concentrations higher than 21 mM.

The catalytic constant values of DGAS-B for MU 29.09 min-1 and sucrose 9.54 min-1 were higher than those of DGAS for MU 19.56 min-1 and sucrose 5.17 min-1.
