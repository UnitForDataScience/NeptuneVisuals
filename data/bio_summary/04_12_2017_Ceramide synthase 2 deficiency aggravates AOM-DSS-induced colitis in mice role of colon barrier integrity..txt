Colons from CerS2-- mice are bloody in comparison to CerS2 miceTable 1 RNA levels of CerS1-6 and glycosylceramide synthase GCS in colons of CerS2 and CerS2-- mice with and without treatment of AOM and two cycles of DSS data are the mean - SD and mice in each group nmRNACerS2 controlCerS2 DSSCerS2-- controlCerS2-- DSSMeanSDnMeanSDnMeanSDnMeanSDnSignificance of means was examined by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Turkey's correction and revealed no significant changes therefore trends are indicated in different fonts ''bold'' indicates that the level is upregulated in comparison to CerS2 control mice ''italics'' indicates that the level is downregulated in comparison to CerS2 control miceCerS2 mice which did not occur or was reduced in CerS2-- mice.

CerS2-- mice showed a loss of expression of zonula occludens-1 ZO-1 and occludin expression in the colon tissue afterTable 2 Sphingolipid levels determined by LC-MSMS in colon and bloodngml plasmaCerS2 controlCerS2 DSSCerS2-- ControlCerS2-- DSSMeanSDnMeanSDnMeanSDnMeanSDnSphingolipids plasmaData are mean - SD.

e Pictures of whole colon and swiss rolls of CerS2 and CerS2-- mice after 12 weeks and three cycles of DSSimaging of living mice confirmed the stronger bowel inflammation in CerS2-- mice Fig.

To circumvent this problem we used the ex vivo permeabilityDapianti-ZO-1mergezoom inCerS2 controlCerS2 DSSCerS2-- controlCerS2-- DSSFig.

CD11b Ly6C and F480 positive cells were more abundant in CerS2-- mice compared with CerS2 mice Supplement 3 A-D.DiscussionThe present study shows that CerS2-- mice are much more sensitive towards AOMDSS evoked colitis than CerS2 mice owing to a disruption of intestinal epithelial barrierAMo n o c y te s B lo o dC D 1 1 b   L y6 C   L y6G -20 15 10 50Mo n o c y te s L PCD 1 1 b   L y 6 C   L y 6 G -50 40 30 20 10 0Mo n o c y te s IE LC D 11 b  L y 6 C   L y 6 G -50 40 30 20 10 0T- re gs B loo dC D 3  C D 4   G IT R   C D 25 6T- re gs L PC D 3   CD4   G IT R   C D 2 5 60 T-re g s IE LC D 3   C D 4  G IT R  C D 2 5 640442022000-2 0-2 C D 4 T - ce llsCD3   CD4  NK1 .

Consequently connexin 32 was dislocated and increasingly degraded in CerS2-- mice  likely contributing to the loss of intestinal barrier function.CerS and GCS in the colon were upregulated in CerS2 but not in CerS-- mice after AOMDSS treatment.

Here we used a loss-of-function model CerS2 and CerS2-- mice to investigate the impact of ceramide synthase 2 a key enzyme in the gen- eration of very long-chain ceramides in the dextran sodium salt DSS evoked model of UC.

CerS2-- mice developed more severe disease than CerS2 mice in acute DSS and chronic AOMDSS colitis.
