e pictures of whole colon and swiss rolls of cers2 and cers2-- mice after 12 weeks and three cycles of dssimaging of living mice confirmed the stronger bowel inflammation in cers2-- mice fig.

immunohistochemistry of cers2 in colon tissue revealed that cers2 is expressed mainly in colon epithelial cells in cers2 mice but undetectable in cers2-- supplement 1. the localization agrees with thehumantissueatlas .as expected the levels of c240- and c241-cer which are mainly produced by cers2 were strongly reduced in colon and plasma of cers2-- mice in comparison tofig.

to circumvent this problem we used the ex vivo permeabilitydapianti-zo-1mergezoom incers2 controlcers2 dsscers2-- controlcers2-- dssfig.

cd11b ly6c and f480 positive cells were more abundant in cers2-- mice compared with cers2 mice supplement 3 a-d.discussionthe present study shows that cers2-- mice are much more sensitive towards aomdss evoked colitis than cers2 mice owing to a disruption of intestinal epithelial barrieramo n o c y te s b lo o dc d 1 1 b   l y6 c   l y6g -20 15 10 50mo n o c y te s l pcd 1 1 b   l y 6 c   l y 6 g -50 40 30 20 10 0mo n o c y te s ie lc d 11 b  l y 6 c   l y 6 g -50 40 30 20 10 0t- re gs b loo dc d 3  c d 4   g it r   c d 25 6t- re gs l pc d 3   cd4   g it r   c d 2 5 60 t-re g s ie lc d 3   c d 4  g it r  c d 2 5 640442022000-2 0-2 c d 4 t - ce llscd3   cd4  nk1 .

consequently connexin 32 was dislocated and increasingly degraded in cers2-- mice  likely contributing to the loss of intestinal barrier function.cers and gcs in the colon were upregulated in cers2 but not in cers-- mice after aomdss treatment.

here we used a loss-of-function model cers2 and cers2-- mice to investigate the impact of ceramide synthase 2 a key enzyme in the gen- eration of very long-chain ceramides in the dextran sodium salt dss evoked model of uc.

cers2-- mice developed more severe disease than cers2 mice in acute dss and chronic aomdss colitis.

in naive cers2-- mice the expression of tight junction proteins including zo-1 was almost completely lost in the colon epithelium leading to increased membrane permeability.

the increase in membrane permeability in cers2-- mice did not manifest with apparent clinical symptoms in naive mice but with slight inflammatory signs such as an increase in monocytes and il-10.

this was associated with stronger upregulation of cytoki- nes in cers2-- mice and increased infiltration of the colon wall by immune cells particularly monocytes cd4 and th17 t-cells and an increase in tumor burden.

on the other hand cers2-- mice are partially protected from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis a model of multiple scle- rosis because cers2-deficient neutrophils lack normal migratory properties thus limiting their infiltration into the cns .
