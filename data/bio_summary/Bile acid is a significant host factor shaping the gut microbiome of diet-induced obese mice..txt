the response of gut microbiota alteration lagged behind that of ba increase implying that bas might regulate the composition of gut microbiota.bas alone induce the obesity-associated gut microbial compositionto confirm that the hfd-induced gut microbial alter- ations were correlated with bas bas were adminis- tered to mice under normal diet conditions.

thus utilization of an fxr agonist may pre- vent or reverse hfd-induced gut microbiome alterations and impair the development of obese phenotypes.discussiondiet can affect the intestinal microbiota composition and activity in various ways including providing pre- biotic substrates and other fermentable constituents regulating transit time ph and host secretions as well as influencing gene expression in both the host and microbiome based on the global metabolome ana- lysis and multivariate statistics performed herein bas showed a predominant role in host-microbiota co- metabolism confirming that bas are a significant dietary factor influencing the composition of gut microbiota.previous reports have shown that a hfd changes the relative composition of gut microbiota by increasing firmicutes and decreasing bacteroidetes at phylum levels along with alterations of the microbes at species levels such as bilophila and bacteroides   our re- sults confirmed a similar shift in population between bilophila spp.

of these bile acids bas represent a highly abundant pool of host-derived and microbial- modified metabolites that are major regulators of the gut microbiome hfd-induced ba secretion as a driving force in shaping the obesity-associated gut microbial composition was first proposed in 2011 by islam et al.

identification of specific micro- biota alterations in response to bas may suggest new therapeutic strategies that target ba metabolism for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases.resultscorrelation of metabolome with gut microbiome in response to hfd treatment revealed that bas were an important dietary factor impacting gut microbiota compositionmale c57bl6 mice 3 weeks old were fed normal chow control group and a hfd hfd group for 8 weeks prior to sacrifice.

thus bas were identified as significant metabolic factors correlated with the gut microbiota providing the rationale for further studies of the interaction of bas with gut microbiota.to assess the interaction of bas with caecal micro-biota we quantified the concentration of bas in the cae- cal content of mice fed with control chow and hfd and found that caecal ba levels were dramatically increased in response to hfd fig.

most microbes in bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia phyla were negatively correlated with ba changes while those in firumicutes and proteobacteria phyla were positively correlated with ba changes.how bas alter the gut microbial compositionin order to determine the temporal relationship between ba exposure and alterations in intestinal microbial composition in response to hfd we performed time- dependent studies on bas and gut microbiome com- position with hfd intervention.

the inter- action of bas and the gut microbiome is well-known however herein the link between exposure to spe- cific types of bas and specific changes in gut microbiota was revealed in a time course experiment that clearly demonstrated that the hfd-induced secretion of bas into the intestine maximized at 12 h post-hfd and pre- ceded the changes in microbiota which maximized at 72 h. these results thus demonstrate that bas are re- sponsible for microbiota composition changes.

con- sidering the sex-based differences in ba patterns and gut microbial composition future studies on both sexes are required.conclusionsour study provided a correlative relationship between bas and the hfd-induced alteration of gut micro- biota.

the gut microbiota composition is partially modulated by the extracellular metabolites that are derived from host and modifiedc jia et al.

who observed that rats fed cholic acid ca experienced increases in firmicutes accompanied by decreases in bacteroidetes phyla the resulting altered microbial signature was similar to that of obesity-associated gut microbiome.

the impact of bas on gut microbial composition has also been highlighted in murine colitis models feeding mice a diet rich in milk-derived fat induced elevated levels of the ba taurocholic acid tca facilitating the outgrowth of bilophila wads- worthia a bacteria species linked to the induction of colitis.

unfortunately it remains unclear how the mam- malian gut microbiome responds to short or long-term diet-induced changes in the ba pool.

a systems-level understanding of microbe-microbe and microbe-me- tabolite interactions in the human gut is critical for un- derstanding the potential limitations and opportunities of probiotic treatments.
