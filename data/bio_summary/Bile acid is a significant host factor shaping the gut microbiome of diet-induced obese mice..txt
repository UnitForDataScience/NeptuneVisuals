Thus BAs were identified as significant metabolic factors correlated with the gut microbiota providing the rationale for further studies of the interaction of BAs with gut microbiota.To assess the interaction of BAs with caecal micro-biota we quantified the concentration of BAs in the cae- cal content of mice fed with control chow and HFD and found that caecal BA levels were dramatically increased in response to HFD Fig.

The inter- action of BAs and the gut microbiome is well-known however herein the link between exposure to spe- cific types of BAs and specific changes in gut microbiota was revealed in a time course experiment that clearly demonstrated that the HFD-induced secretion of BAs into the intestine maximized at 12 h post-HFD and pre- ceded the changes in microbiota which maximized at 72 h. These results thus demonstrate that BAs are re- sponsible for microbiota composition changes.

The unconjugated BAs could be sorted into two distinct groups conformed of most primary BAs which had an increased concentration and most secondary BAs which had a decreased concentration.

The response of gut microbiota alteration lagged behind that of BA increase implying that BAs might regulate the composition of gut microbiota.BAs alone induce the obesity-associated gut microbial compositionTo confirm that the HFD-induced gut microbial alter- ations were correlated with BAs BAs were adminis- tered to mice under normal diet conditions.

were found to be capable of 7a-dehydroxylation to pro- duce the more anti-microbial secondary BAs from pri- mary BAs  Secondary BAs are known to be high affinity ligands for FXR BA activation of FXR downregulates BA synthesis and stimulates the synthesis of BA-detoxifying enzymes.

Identification of specific micro- biota alterations in response to BAs may suggest new therapeutic strategies that target BA metabolism for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases.ResultsCorrelation of metabolome with gut microbiome in response to HFD treatment revealed that BAs were an important dietary factor impacting gut microbiota compositionMale C57BL6 mice 3 weeks old were fed normal chow control group and a HFD HFD group for 8 weeks prior to sacrifice.

Significance is established at adjusted P  0.05 with FDR  0.05CA-derived BAs including CA TCA and GCA were significantly increased implying that CA-derived BAs might be the important BA species in the response to dietary fat.Dietary fat-induced gut microbiome alteration and its correlation with BAsThe impact of a HFD on caecal microbiota composition was revealed by sequencing of the respective 16S rRNA genes.

under the phylum Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia muciniphila under the phylum Verrucomicrobia were significantly lower.To visualize the correlation of BAs and gut microbiota a Spearman correlation was performed between the rela- tive abundance of the 10 differential microbial species and the concentrations of all BAs across the samples in the control and HFD groups Fig.

Most microbes in Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia phyla were negatively correlated with BA changes while those in Firumicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were positively correlated with BA changes.How BAs alter the gut microbial compositionIn order to determine the temporal relationship between BA exposure and alterations in intestinal microbial composition in response to HFD we performed time- dependent studies on BAs and gut microbiome com- position with HFD intervention.
