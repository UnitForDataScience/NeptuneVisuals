Moreover post-hoc pairwise comparisons focusing on specific differences between the flying squirrel's cecum and the other four groups Supplementary Table 6 indicated that despite several significant pairs the flying squirrel's cecum had clear differences from all other groups in one particular category namely defense mechanisms V. Specifically compared to other mammalian gut metagenomes the flying squirrel's cecal metagenome containeda significantly higher percentage of gene function involved in defense mechanisms Supplementary Table 5 especially for those COG gene families assigned to multidrug efflux pumps Supplementary Table 7.In addition in a comparison of glycoside hydrolase GH groups among all 5 metagenome groups the flying squirrel's cecal metagenome contained relatively high levels of GH3 GH43 and GH53 Supplementary Table 8 those GH groups were specific for degradation of oligosaccharides and were actually enriched in cecal metatranscriptions Figure 7.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrated specialized digestive strategies of the white-faced flying squirrel Petaurista alborufus lena including powerful molars to facilitate mastication of tree leaves and an extended cecum to store ingesta for microbial activities Figure 1.

More importantly those GH sequences contained a high nucleotide variation and in fact were assigned to various bacterial taxa mostly belonging to Firmicutes as listed in Figure 4 suggesting the importance of those enzymatic activities for microbes living in the flying squirrel's cecum.In addition to carbohydrate-degrading ability Figure 8 several genes involved in ABC-type sugar importers Supplementary Figure 9 were detected in the flying squirrel's cecal microbiota with many up-regulated at the RNA level Figures 5 6.

Regarding feed particle sizes Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 2 feedparticles in the stomach were already fine on average 1.5 mm.Nevertheless compared to dry and coarse fibers present in the stomach feed contents in the cecum were even finer on average 0.6 mm with a sludge-like texture Supplementary Figure 3.

Among these abundant genera Clostridium Ruminococcus and Eubacterium all belonging to Firmicutes were the top three in all libraries contributing to the majority up to 50 of annotated protein-coding genes in the cecal metagenome and metatranscriptome.According to the COG annotation Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 5 functional gene families had distinct abundance patterns at DNA and RNA levels.

Functional gene compositions based on the COG annotation Figure 8 demonstrated that 1 functional profiles of cecal metagenomes and ruminal metagenomes were distinct from those based on fecal samples and 2 functional profiles of cecal metagenomes were also distinct from those of ruminal metagenomes.

For example there were relatively high abundances of GH3 GH43 and GH53 in the flying squirrel's cecal metagenome with even enriched levels in the cecal metatranscriptome Figure 8.

In the cecal metagenome and metatranscriptome pathways regarding pentose and glucuronate interconversions Supplementary Figure 10 energy generating from sugar fermentation Supplementary Figures 11 12 and biosynthesis of various macromolecules Supplementary Figures 13-16 were well-represented indicating that plant-sourced sugars could be efficiently transformed into bacterial biomass in the flying squirrel's cecum with adequate fermentation end-products to meet host requirements Bergman 1990 Stevens and Hume 1998.Our interpretation about functional characteristics of the cecal microbiota was based on the consistent patterns of two flying squirrel individuals which may not be enough to robustly demonstrate how symbiotic microbes respond to unique environmental conditions in the cecum.

Future research focusing on more individuals from leaf-eating flying squirrels and other small mammalian herbivores is demanded to capture the functionaluniqueness of the cecal microbiota considering different feeding adaptations and gut structures of large vs. small mammalian herbivores Stevens and Hume 1995 Mackie 2002.In the present study we delineated anatomicalphysiological characteristics of the flying squirrel's digestive system Figure 1 and demonstrated functional characteristics of cecal microbiota based on multiple meta-omic data including metabolomic profiles Figures 2 3 and parallel metagenome- metatranscriptome profiles Figures 4-8.

COG0747 involved in amino acid transport and metabolism also had relatively high abundances at the RNA level.Contrasting functional gene profiles in the metatranscriptome vs. metagenome were also revealed by KEGG annotation Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 6 with distinct types of membrane transport components dominant at RNA--vs. DNA- levels similar to COG results Figures 5 6.

Notably size distribution of feed particles in the large intestine was more similar to that in the stomach than in the cecum Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 2 indicating that some large feed particles might go directly to the large intestine bypassing the cecum corresponding to the description of specialized sorting at the ileal-cecal-colic junction in small herbivores Sakaguchi 2003.
