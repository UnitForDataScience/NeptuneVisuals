Moreover post-hoc pairwise comparisons focusing on specific differences between the flying squirrel's cecum and the other four groups Supplementary Table 6 indicated that despite several significant pairs the flying squirrel's cecum had clear differences from all other groups in one particular category namely defense mechanisms V. Specifically compared to other mammalian gut metagenomes the flying squirrel's cecal metagenome containeda significantly higher percentage of gene function involved in defense mechanisms Supplementary Table 5 especially for those COG gene families assigned to multidrug efflux pumps Supplementary Table 7.In addition in a comparison of glycoside hydrolase GH groups among all 5 metagenome groups the flying squirrel's cecal metagenome contained relatively high levels of GH3 GH43 and GH53 Supplementary Table 8 those GH groups were specific for degradation of oligosaccharides and were actually enriched in cecal metatranscriptions Figure 7.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrated specialized digestive strategies of the white-faced flying squirrel Petaurista alborufus lena including powerful molars to facilitate mastication of tree leaves and an extended cecum to store ingesta for microbial activities Figure 1.

Thus the flying squirrel's cecal microbiota should be an ideal model to investigate microbial functional characteristics with regard to a high-fiber toxin-rich diet.Objectives were to elucidate anatomicalphysiological characteristics of the flying squirrel's digestive system and functional characteristics of its cecal microbiota under a high- fiber and toxin-rich diet.

Functional gene compositions based on the COG annotation Figure 8 demonstrated that 1 functional profiles of cecal metagenomes and ruminal metagenomes were distinct from those based on fecal samples and 2 functional profiles of cecal metagenomes were also distinct from those of ruminal metagenomes.

For example there were relatively high abundances of GH3 GH43 and GH53 in the flying squirrel's cecal metagenome with even enriched levels in the cecal metatranscriptome Figure 8.

In the cecal metagenome and metatranscriptome pathways regarding pentose and glucuronate interconversions Supplementary Figure 10 energy generating from sugar fermentation Supplementary Figures 11 12 and biosynthesis of various macromolecules Supplementary Figures 13-16 were well-represented indicating that plant-sourced sugars could be efficiently transformed into bacterial biomass in the flying squirrel's cecum with adequate fermentation end-products to meet host requirements Bergman 1990 Stevens and Hume 1998.Our interpretation about functional characteristics of the cecal microbiota was based on the consistent patterns of two flying squirrel individuals which may not be enough to robustly demonstrate how symbiotic microbes respond to unique environmental conditions in the cecum.

Future research focusing on more individuals from leaf-eating flying squirrels and other small mammalian herbivores is demanded to capture the functionaluniqueness of the cecal microbiota considering different feeding adaptations and gut structures of large vs. small mammalian herbivores Stevens and Hume 1995 Mackie 2002.In the present study we delineated anatomicalphysiological characteristics of the flying squirrel's digestive system Figure 1 and demonstrated functional characteristics of cecal microbiota based on multiple meta-omic data including metabolomic profiles Figures 2 3 and parallel metagenome- metatranscriptome profiles Figures 4-8.

Here we used leaf-eating flying squirrels as a model to explore functional characteristics of the cecal microbiota adapted to a high-fiber toxin-rich diet.

Then parallel metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were used to detect microbial functions corresponding to the cecal environment.

Based on metagenomic DNA and metatranscriptomic RNA profiles taxonomic compositions of the cecal microbiota were dominated by bacteria of the Firmicutes taxa they contained major gene functions related to degradation and fermentation of leaf-derived compounds.

2017 much less is known about co-adaptation characteristics between small mammalian herbivores and their cecal microbiota.In this study the white-faced flying squirrel Petauristaalborufus lena inhabiting montane areas of Taiwan Oshida et al.
