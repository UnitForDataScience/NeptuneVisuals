4 The percentage of the fat tissue content upon termination of the experiment of the mice fed with SD SD  WP HFD and HFD  WP.

7 The gene expression in the intestine of mice fed with SD HFD SD  WP and HFD  WP.

6 The SCFA from caecal contents upon termination of the experi- ment of the mice fed with SD SD  WP HFD and HFD  WP.

The biodiversity of bacteria within the tested groups of animals fed with SD HFD SD  WP and HFD  WP demon- strated no statistical differences Table 1.

2 Body weight within the following weeks for the mice fed with SD SD  WP HFD HFD  WP.

Legend SD - standard diet HFD - high fat diet SD  WP - standard diet supplemented with whey proteins HFD  WP - high fat diet supplemented with WP.

3 Calorie intake in the following weeks for the mice fed with SD SD  WP HFD HFD  WP.

Diet's supplementation with WPI had no impact on the total number of bacteria in caecum Table 1.The type of diet SD or HFD influenced the number of bifidobacteria with their higher number in the group on SD diet and C. leptum more abundant in the group fed with HFD Table 1.Fig.

5 Blood markers of terminated animals fed with SD HFD SD WP and HFD  WP.

Samples with an asterisk differ statistically  p  0.05.WP supplementation had a statistically relevant influence on the microbiota of mice fed with HFD increasing the number of bifidobacteria and the Eubacterium rectale group incomparison to mice fed with HFD without WPI Table 1.WP supplementation of SD had no effect on the number of analyzed bacterial groups Table 1.There was no statistically significant influence of diet nor diet supplemented with WP on the microbial diversity ana- lyzed with Shannon's index Table 1.WP triggered the increase of total SCFA estimated in the group of animals fed with SD and the decrease in the group of animals fed with HFD Fig.
