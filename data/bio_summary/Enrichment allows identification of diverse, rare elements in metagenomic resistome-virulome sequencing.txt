Resistome-UMI libraries contained an average of 495 and 486 more unique gene accessions than the Metagenome-UMI and Metagenome libraries respectively while the Resistome libraries contained an average of 621 and 612 more unique gene accessions Tukey P  0.001 for all comparisons Table There were no differences in gene richness when comparing the Resistome versus Resistome-UMI and the Metagen- ome versus Metagenome-UMI libraries Tukey P  0.05.

Specifically the Resistome dataset yielded an average of 1497 range 259-3157 read-pair haplotypes per gene iden- tified while the Resistome-UMI Metagenome and Metagenome-UMI datasets averaged 720 range 44-2290 57 range 9-168 and 63 range 11-143 respectively Tukey P  0.001 for all pairwise compar- isons except between Metagenome and Metagenome- UMI which was not significant.Only one gene was identified in all 64 sequencing li- braries namely an ermG gene that mediates resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin class of an- timicrobials We used this gene to illustrate the util- ity of comparing SNP patterns of AMR genes found in different samples focusing only on SNPs that were found in all 4 samples from each sample type and each library assay.

Therefore another aim of this work was to incorporate the use of unique molecular indices UMIs into the workflow These randomly generated 12-mer oligonucleotide sequences are affixed to individual DNA molecules prior to bait-capture and enrichment and thus can be used to correct for PCR bias and to count rare individual DNA se- quences in post-sequencing analysis 3 To test the accuracy and efficiency of a combined bait- capture enrichment and UMI system which we term MEGaRICH 4 aliquots of whole-sample DNA from each of 16 samples were subjected to the following li- brary preparation assays 1 non-enriched metagenomic DNA libraries Metagenome 2 resistome-enriched metagenomic DNA libraries Resistome 3 non- enriched metagenomic DNA libraries with UMIs Metagenome-UMI and 4 resistome-enriched meta- genomic DNA libraries with UMIs Resistome-UMI for a total of 64 sequencing libraries.

The Metagenome-UMI libraries had higher equitability than both the Resistome-UMI and Resistome libraries Tukey P  0.001 and 0.02 re- spectively and the Metagenome libraries had higher equitability than the Resistome-UMI libraries Tukey P  0.008.

The Resistome- UMI and Metagenome-UMI libraries were created using a protocol that incorporated dual-indexed UMI adapters see Additional file  into sequence libraries with modifications to allow for integration with Agilent Sure- Select protocols see Additional file Supplementary Methods for details.SequencingAll 64 sequencing libraries were sequenced at a depth of four libraries per lane i.e.

Our overall objective was to characterize the low-abundance portion of the resistome and selected virulence factors heretofore simply termed the resistome as compared to the high-abundance portion and to determine whether this low-abundance portion could provide additional insight into resis- tome dynamics.ResultsBait-capture and enrichment enabled access to  1000 additional low-abundance gene sequencesAcross all 64 sequenced libraries we identified 2490 unique antimicrobial resistance AR metal resistance MR biocide resistance BR and virulence factor VF gene accessions across 48 unique classes of resistance and virulence.

Cumulatively reads aligning to these 1441 unique gene accessions accounted for just 1.8 of all reads that aligned to the resistance- virulence database across all 64 sequence sequencing libraries indicating that these genes were part of the low-abundance or rare portion of the resistome.These descriptive trends were reflected in statistical comparisons of gene richness between library prepar- ation assays.

the 1441 gene accessions identified only via bait-capture and enrichmentBait-capture and enrichment increased on-target sequencing without deficits in gene coverageThe proportion of on-target sequencing across all 64 sequencing libraries ranged from 0.002 to 61.8 with statistically significant differences between all assays except Metagenome and Metagenome-UMI Fig.

Medians without letters were not subjected to pairwise comparison because the omnibus ANOVA test was not significant P  0.05This suggests that the decreased equitability in the enriched samples compensated for the increased rich- ness resulting in no statistically significant differences in diversity.The low-abundance portion of the resistome differed sig- nificantly from the abundant portionImportantly the additional 1441 identified gene acces- sions were not simply additional variants of resistance mechanisms that had already been identified in the non- enriched libraries.
