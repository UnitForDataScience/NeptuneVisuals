a minor- ity of the additional 1441 accessions were vf genes related to enteric pathogens 2861441 or 19.8. at the read level the vast majority of the additional reads align- ing to these 1441 genes originated from ar genes 87.3 while 10.7 originated from vf genes and 2.0 originated from br or mr genes.

our overall objective was to characterize the low-abundance portion of the resistome and selected virulence factors heretofore simply termed the resistome as compared to the high-abundance portion and to determine whether this low-abundance portion could provide additional insight into resis- tome dynamics.resultsbait-capture and enrichment enabled access to  1000 additional low-abundance gene sequencesacross all 64 sequenced libraries we identified 2490 unique antimicrobial resistance ar metal resistance mr biocide resistance br and virulence factor vf gene accessions across 48 unique classes of resistance and virulence.

although live- stock resistomes have not been heavily studied available data corroborate the sparsity of these resistance genes within livestock-associated samples sequenced using non-enriched metagenomic methods - with the exception of bla-tem genes detected in livestock fecal samples collected in china increased sensitiv- ity for rare yet clinically important sequences is espe- cially important given interest from the scientific and regulatory communities in metagenomic sequencing for pathogen detection and amr surveillance - however it should be noted that the risk of low- abundance amr genes within metagenomic samples is not yet well understood genomic context i.e.

the singleton rate for each sequencing library seemed to dictate the singleton rate for all genes identified within the library as rank-abundance curves showed a lack of positive or nega- tive relationship additional file figure s3.discussionthe limits of sequencing technology to detect low- abundance members of ecosystems have been recog- nized for many years here we demonstrated the existence extent and importance of this detection limit for resistome analyses by the use of shotgun metage- nomic sequencing of non-enriched and enriched dna from the same samples using the same analytical methods.

amplification rates varied widely between sequencing libraries ranging from 7.6- 84.1. the rates did not vary systematically with sequencing library diversity richness yield or 260280 ratio additional file figure s1 but did exhibit a loga- rithmic relationship with post-capture amplification dna yield and proportion of post-capture dna library used in sequencing additional file figure s2.

these results highlight the insensitivity of non-enriched metagenomic sequencing for detecting high-importance high-prevalence but low-abundance genes that may be present in samples.the low-abundance resistome contained a higher diversity of resistance genes with highly informative snpsuse of megarich enabled identification of more read-pair haplotypes per gene anova p  0.001 indicating that the low-abundance portion of the resistome contained more within-gene genetic diver- sity than the high-abundance resistome.

the majority of these additional 1441 genes originated from ar br and mr genes 11551441 or 80.2 and the majority of these were specific to ar 9991155 or 86.5 additional file file s1.

non- enriched shotgun metagenomic sequencing failed to detect the low-abundance members of the resistome which comprised 247 additional gene groups specific to antimicrobial resistance represented by 1155 additional resistance-related gene accessions.

genes identified in all 64 sequencing libraries were subjected to further snp analysis to assess variant stratification by sample type and library assay see additional file supplementary method for details.descriptive and statistical analysesa number of metrics were used to evaluate potential differences between library preparation assays see additional file supplementary methods for details.

total raw reads per sequencing library were higher in the resistome-umi and metagenome- umi datasets compared to the metagenome dataset tukey p  0.05 table for complete sequencing statis- tics see additional file file s4 and therefore were in- cluded as a potential confounder in all analyses of capture efficiency see additional file supplementary methods.

this approach enables characterization of all amr genes within a microbial community the resistome which can be useful in un- derstanding evolutionary shifts in amr as well as for detecting transfer of diverse amr genes betweenhosts environments or uncultivable organisms amr is an inherently ecological phenomenon with processes including transfer of genetic elements between divergent bacteria increased promiscuity and mutation in the face of bacterial stress and inflammation and co-selection and co-mobility of multiple genes - shotgun metagenomics represents a tool for advancing our understanding of these interactions by enabling ac- cess to the genetic material of the microbial population correspondence equal contributors3department of clinical sciences colorado state university fort collins co usafull list of author information is available at the end of the articleas a whole in addition metagenomic sampling could augment epidemiological surveillance and outbreak in- vestigations of amr c the authors.

specifically the resistome dataset yielded an average of 1497 range 259-3157 read-pair haplotypes per gene iden- tified while the resistome-umi metagenome and metagenome-umi datasets averaged 720 range 44-2290 57 range 9-168 and 63 range 11-143 respectively tukey p  0.001 for all pairwise compar- isons except between metagenome and metagenome- umi which was not significant.only one gene was identified in all 64 sequencing li- braries namely an ermg gene that mediates resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin class of an- timicrobials we used this gene to illustrate the util- ity of comparing snp patterns of amr genes found in different samples focusing only on snps that were found in all 4 samples from each sample type and each library assay.

currently metagenomic data are not conducive to genomic localization as the assem- blies tend to be highly fragmented therefore until the risk of these low-abundance genes is better under- stood large-scale surveillance efforts that utilize baitenrichment andor metagenomic sequencing should include follow-up isolation andor pcr of identified genes to better assess their clinical andor public health significance.
