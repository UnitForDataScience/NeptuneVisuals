although the specific mechanisms involved in the origin of colostrum and mature milk microbiota are still under investigation two main hypotheses exist i the ex- istence of an entero-mammary pathway which could lead intestinal bacteria directly to the mammary ducts by means of dendritic cells and cd18 cells ii a retro- grade flow during nursing whereby the oral bacteria of infants could influence the colostrum microbiota interestingly a recent study also highlighted the po- tential role that the mode of delivery can have in modu- lating the bacterial composition of human mature milk as the concentration of various bacterial genera was higher in the breast milk of mothers who underwent vaginal delivery as opposed to mothers who underwent cesarean section c-section  recently the effectsof c-section versus vaginal delivery on the compos- ition of infant microbiota and on infant health have been the object of numerous studies and yet the spe- cific effects they have on human life have not been fully clarified -.the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of delivery mode on the microbiota composition of col- ostrum samples.

specifically we evaluated both bacterial abundance and interactions microbiota network within colostrum samples associated with either c-section or vaginal delivery by a next generation sequencing ngs approach applied to auto-contractive map autocm.resultsbacterial diversity in the colostrum microbiota in relation to the mode of deliveryto evaluate any differences in the bacterial diversity between the colostrum belonging to mothers who underwent natural delivery and mothers who delivered by c-section we calculated the shannon simpson and chao's indices fig.

diet is one of the main factors which can influence the composition of colostrum micro- biota and for this reason all mothers enrolled in the present study had the same dietary intake namely a large amount of animal proteins fat and sugar in their diet.in the present study the colostrum microbiota com- position was strongly influenced by the mode of delivery as significant differences in terms of biodiversity bacter- ial abundance and microbial interactions were observed comparing c-section colostrum microbiota with that of vaginal delivery.

in both c-section and vaginal delivery colostrum networks the staphylococcus hub was directly linked to propionibac- terium while ruminococcus interacted with faecalibacter- ium and sutterella outlining a potential common role of these microorganisms in colostrum independent of the mode of delivery.

the central nodes of this network were represented by ruminococcus and peptostreptococcus.the vaginal delivery colostrum instead showed a dif- ferent microbiota network in which the main hubs were represented by achromobacter aeromonas bacillus blautia clostridium coprococcus eubacterium faecali- bacterium granulicatella kocuria micrococcus oscilli- bacter rhodanobacter raoultella ruminococcus serratia and staphylococcus fig.

haemophilus is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen with a negative role on the host'shealth although we observed that haemophilus was more abundant in vaginal delivery colostrum it was of crucial importance only in c-section colostrum where it acted as one of the main bacterial hubs detected in the microbiota network.

interestingly breast milk contains high levels of oxygen similar to those detected in venous plasma that can justify the greater abundance of aerobic bacteria considering bacterial interactions within the colostrum we observed a different microbiota distribution in c- section relative to vaginal delivery colostrum.

enhancing at the same time the beneficial activity of faecalibacterium.conclusionsthe present study demonstrates that the mode of delivery plays a pivotal role in modulating the microbiota of the col- ostrum.

not only the abundance of different bacterial genera but also microorganismal interactions microbiota network were significantly different between c-section and vaginal delivery colostrum.

obviously numerous factors can influence the colostrum microbiota composition life- style dietary habits and the physical characteristics of the mother are all important features that can potentially im- pact on the composition of the colostrum and mature milk.methodsstudy populationthis study involved 29 mothers 15 who underwent vaginal delivery and 14 who delivered by c-section who were recruited from the postnatal wards policlinico gb rossi verona italy.participants were selected and included in the study according to the following criteria i compliance with the study protocol ii healthy infants iii collection of colostrum within 3 days after birth.
