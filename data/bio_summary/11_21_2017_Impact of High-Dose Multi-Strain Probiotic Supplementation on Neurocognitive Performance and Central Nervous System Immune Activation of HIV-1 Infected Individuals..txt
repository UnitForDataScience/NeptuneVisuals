no statistically significant difference in csf neopterin levels were found between the two groups p  0.05 at t0 higher levels were found in patients with the impairment of at least two neurocognitive domains than in those with a single neurocognitive domain impairment.table 2. baseline neurocognitive tests results expressed as median values interquartile range is reported between brackets.neurocognitive testsprobiotics supplementationcontrol group t0p-valuemore is better more is better more is better more is bettermore is better more is bettermore is better less is better less is betterat the end of supplementation t6 in the intervention group we observed that the results of viral replication in csf remained stably suppressed hiv-rna in csf resulted 37 copiesml in all subjects at t6 and the neopterin concentration in csf significantly decreased at t6 when compared to t0 values t6 24.11 nmoll vs. t0 34.14 nmoll p  0.011. the results of the neuropsychological tests at t0 and t6 among participants who underwent probiotics supplementation are shown in table  an improvement in overall neurocognitive performance was observed in the majority of our population with a significant improvement revealed in multiple tests--immediate copy of the rey-osterrieth complex figure p  0.0089 delayed copy of the rey-osterrieth complex figure p  0.0039 immediate recall during the rey auditory verbal learning test p  0.027 delayed recall during the rey auditory verbal learning test p  0.042 time estimation during the test of time and weights estimation p  0.043 weight estimation during the test of time and weights estimation p  0.035 phonological verbal fluency test p  0.027 trail making test a p  0.0502 and forward corsi block tapping test p  0.057. a direct correlation with neopterin concentration in csf was observed at t6 with the results for the trail making test b r  0.741 p  0.022 in contrast an inverse correlation was observed between neopterin and the forward corsi block tapping test r  -0.793 p  0.011. a slight inverse correlation was also observed between raven's standard progressive matrices test and neopterin in csf r  -0.644 p  0.061. cpe scores did not show any correlation with neopterin or any of the provided neurocognitive tests at t6.

moreover a possible limitation is the role of ani that is at present being debated.despite these limitations justified by the complexity of the procedures and ethical issues our findings suggest that supplementation with probiotics could represent a novel strategy to manage neurocognitive impairment in cart treated hiv-1 infected patients but larger studies are needed prior to introducing this intervention into everyday clinical practice.acknowledgments we thank all the participants for the study.author contributions giancarlo ceccarelli study concept and design interpretation of data and critical revision of manuscript for intellectual content eugenio nelson cavallari study concept and design acquisition analysis and interpretation of data ivan schietroma study concept and design acquisition analysis and interpretation of data giuseppe corano scheri study concept and design acquisition analysis and interpretation of data saeid najafi fard study concept acquisition of data claudia pinacchio study design acquisition of datamariangela fratino study concept acquisition analysis and interpretation of data carolina scagnolari study design critical revision of manuscript for intellectual content ivano mezzaroma study design interpretation of data critical revision of manuscript for intellectual content vincenzo vullo and jason m. brenchley study supervision critical revision of manuscript for intellectual content gabriella d'ettorre study concept and design interpretation of data study supervision critical revision of manuscript for intellectual content.conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest and no founding sponsors.referencesheaton r.k. franklin d.r.

on the other hand to investigate the role of dysbiosis on neuroinflammation and cognitive performance we assigned nine participants with highest levels of neuroinflammation shown by their levels of neopterin in csf which were higher than the control group from our study population to start supplementation with oral probiotics for 6 months interventional group.at the end of the supplementation period we observed a reduction in cns immune activation and an improvement in cognitive performance in the intervention group thus suggesting a possible role of probiotics in the treatment of the intrathecal immune activation and cognitive impairment of hiv infected individuals.

in this study we evaluated the impact of a 6 month course of high dose multi-strain probiotic supplementation on csf immune activation and neurocognitive impairment of hiv-1 positive patients.materials and methodsstudy design recruitment study eligibility criteria and ethics statementthe present study included 35 hiv infected individuals enrolled at the hiv outpatient clinic of the department of public health and infectious diseases of university of rome sapienza.

all subjects enrolled in the study showed an hiv-rna in csf 37 copiesml and the median concentration of neopterin in csf was 23.4 nmoll 10.5-65.2. participants also showed negative polimerase-chain reaction pcr tests on csf for cmv ebv hsv-1 hsv-2 vzv hhv-8 bkv and jcv.

at baseline t0 all participants underwent i a lumbar puncture to assess hiv-rna pcr for cmv ebv hsv-1 hsv-2 vzv hhv-8 bkv jcv and neopterin concentration in csf ii an array of neuropsychological tests.subsequently we divided the enrolled patients into two groups on the basis of their neuroinflammation levels interventional group with higher level of csf neopterin and controlgroup with lower levels of csf neopterin.

no correlation was observed between the cns penetration effectiveness cpe score and the neopterin concentration in csf nor between the cpe score and neurocognitive performance suggesting a possible low impact of cart on the treatment of neuroinflammation and neurocognitive impairment.when we divided the enrolled patients into two groups intervention group and control group on the basis of their neuroinflammation levels we observed that at t0 both groups showed similarresults in neurocognitive performances table  despite their different neopterin concentrations observed in csf taken together these data suggest that the levels of neuroinflammation are not the only determinant of the neurocognitive impairment in hiv-1 infected patients.

in fact at t6 the intervention group showed improved results in comparison to controls in the following tests immediate recall of rocf delayed recall of rocf immediate recall of ravlt delayed recall of ravlt recognition of ravlt fab step weight and step total improvements were also observed within the intervention group between t0 and t6 while on the other hand controls showed no advances table .also the neopterin concentration decreased after supplementation with probiotics but the reduction in the neopterin concentration cannot be explained by better suppression of hiv replication in csf given the fact that hiv-rna results were undetectable in all participants at t0 and t6.

nine participants with higher levels of csf neopterin interventional group underwent a six month course of supplementation with oral probiotics 2 sachets each containing 450 x 109 billion bacteria twice a day the selected probiotic was a commercially available product with the following composition lactobacillus plantarum dsm 24730 streptococcus thermophilus dsm 24731 bifidobacterium breve dsm 24732 lactobacillus paracasei dsm 24733 lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.

no difference was observed in the cd4 count between t0 and t6 among these individuals 674 cellul vs. 682 cellul p  0.959.neurocognitive performance was also evaluated among the 26 individuals who did not undergo supplementation with probiotics this was assessed by a second administration of the assay of neuropsychological tests at t6 results are shown in table .

conclusions multi-strain probiotic supplementation seems to exert a positive effect on neuroinflammation and neurocognitive impairment in hiv-1 infected subjects but large trials are needed to support the concept that modulation of the gut microbiota can provide specific neurological benefits in these patients.nutrients 2017 9 1269 doikeywords hiv asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment immune activation central nervous system neopterin probiotic supplementation multi-strain dysbiosis gut-brain axisintroductionfollowing the widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy cart the prevalence of severe neurocognitive impairments among hiv-1 infected individuals considerably decreased while the prevalence of milder extents of hiv-1 associated neurocognitive disorders such as asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment persisted at a stable rate among this population .

this study evaluated the impact of a probiotic supplementation strategy on intrathecal immune activation and cognitive performance in combined antiretroviral therapy cart treated hiv-1 infected subjects.
