The results of the neuropsychological tests at T0 and T6 among participants who underwent probiotics supplementation are shown in Table  an improvement in overall neurocognitive performance was observed in the majority of our population with a significant improvement revealed in multiple tests--immediate copy of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure p  0.0089 delayed copy of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure p  0.0039 immediate recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test p  0.027 delayed recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test p  0.042 time estimation during the Test of Time and Weights Estimation p  0.043 weight estimation during the Test of Time and Weights Estimation p  0.035 Phonological Verbal Fluency Test p  0.027 Trail Making Test A p  0.0502 and forward Corsi Block Tapping Test p  0.057.

No difference was observed in the CD4 count between T0 and T6 among these individuals 674 celluL vs. 682 celluL p  0.959.Neurocognitive performance was also evaluated among the 26 individuals who did not undergo supplementation with probiotics this was assessed by a second administration of the assay of neuropsychological tests at T6 results are shown in Table .

In fact at T6 the intervention group showed improved results in comparison to controls in the following tests immediate recall of ROCF delayed recall of ROCF immediate recall of RAVLT delayed recall of RAVLT recognition of RAVLT FAB STEP weight and STEP total improvements were also observed within the intervention group between T0 and T6 while on the other hand controls showed no advances Table .Also the neopterin concentration decreased after supplementation with probiotics but the reduction in the neopterin concentration cannot be explained by better suppression of HIV replication in CSF given the fact that HIV-RNA results were undetectable in all participants at T0 and T6.

On the contrary at T0 neopterin was inversely correlated with the results for the following tests forward Corsi Block Tapping Test r  -0.474 p  0.004 backward Corsi Block Tapping Test r  -0.468 p  0.005 forward Digit test r  -0.480 p  0.004 and Verbal Fluency test r  -0.361 p  0.033.

HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus.At the end of the supplementation period T6 participants from the intervention group underwent a second lumbar puncture and a second neurocognitive assessment battery while controls the remaining 26 subjects were assessed with a second assay of neurocognitive tests a parallel version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test RAVLT was administered at T6 parallel versions with Italian validation for the other tests are not available.Neuropsychological Test BatteryNeuropsychological tests administered by a trained neuropsychologist explored verbal areas language attention working memory abstraction executive learning memory processing speed of information sensory-perceptual and motor skills.
