Unlike traditional NSAIDs selective COX-2 NSAIDs results in lower adverse gastrointestinal effects19 even if this beneficial effect may be lost with long-term use14.Utzeri E et al .

The topical effects are by definition independent from the impact of NSAIDs on COX21.From a pharmacokinetic point of view NSAIDs are weak acids pKa 3-6 which are protonated and then absorbed in the stomach according to their lipophilicity2223.

According to some animal models the NSAIDs especially indomethacin are rapidly excreted via the bile and then enter the enterohepatic circulationThe intestinal micro-organisms and their degradation products are necessary for the development of NSAIDs enteropathy as ''germ-free'' animals were found to be resistant to indomethacin injuries1459.

This mechanism of unbalanced increase of Gram- negative bacteria in NSAID users has not as yet been elucidated however it seems that the bacteria might easily penetrate into the mucosa when mucosal permeability is enhanced by NSAIDs65.Recently more importance has been placed on the co-administration of NSAIDs and the inhibitors of gastric acid secretion such as proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor antagonists in determining a significant alteration of intestinal microbiota composition and exacerbating NSAIDs enteropathy2166.

NSAIDs enteropathy is due to enterohepatic recycling of the drugs resulting in a prolonged and repeated exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the compound and its metabolites.

World J Gastroenterol 2017 2322 3954-3963 Available from URL DOI INTRODUCTIONNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs are among the most consumed drugs in the world thanks to their benefits as analgesic anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agents1.

However these benefits are in part overshadowed by the recurrence of digestive system complications which may arise during the course of therapy and can at times be severe.Nevertheless NSAIDs can cause a variety of functional and structural abnormalities even in the small and large intestine for patients who make long-term use of the said drugs.
