Unlike traditional NSAIDs selective COX-2 NSAIDs results in lower adverse gastrointestinal effects19 even if this beneficial effect may be lost with long-term use14.Utzeri E et al .

The topical effects are by definition independent from the impact of NSAIDs on COX21.From a pharmacokinetic point of view NSAIDs are weak acids pKa 3-6 which are protonated and then absorbed in the stomach according to their lipophilicity2223.

According to some animal models the NSAIDs especially indomethacin are rapidly excreted via the bile and then enter the enterohepatic circulationThe intestinal micro-organisms and their degradation products are necessary for the development of NSAIDs enteropathy as ''germ-free'' animals were found to be resistant to indomethacin injuries1459.

This mechanism of unbalanced increase of Gram- negative bacteria in NSAID users has not as yet been elucidated however it seems that the bacteria might easily penetrate into the mucosa when mucosal permeability is enhanced by NSAIDs65.Recently more importance has been placed on the co-administration of NSAIDs and the inhibitors of gastric acid secretion such as proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor antagonists in determining a significant alteration of intestinal microbiota composition and exacerbating NSAIDs enteropathy2166.
