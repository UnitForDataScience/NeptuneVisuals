second the neutrophil chemotaxin and activator c5a have been reported to in- duce neutrophil-derived phosphatidylserine-positive microvesicles early in the course of inflammation in- cluding peritonitis induced by urate crystals in mice such microvesicles suppress c5a priming of the nlrp3 inflammasome and induction of il-1b release and neutrophil influx via mer receptor tyrosine kinase signaling  these effects are shared by synthetic phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes and by neutrophil- derived microvesicles isolated from joint fluids of patients with gouty arthritis third annexin a1 promotes acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis and can combine with acetate transglutaminase 2 and the inhibitory c-type lectin receptor 12a to promote associated efferocytosis and resolution of the acute phase of experimental gouty inflam- mation 6  6.epigenetic effects via mir-146aincreased mir-146a suppresses multiple urate crystal- induced inflammatory responses in vitro including il- 1b expression in a study of patients with gout mir-146a has been reported to be significantly increased in pbmcs between flares compared to controls with normal serum urate hyperuricemia and gout patients during acute flares moreover mir-146a expression is broadly detected in tophi urate crystals induce mir-146a in cultured mononuclear phagocytic cells however tissue levels of this epigenetic transcriptional suppressor of gouty inflammation decrease early in experi- mental urate crystal-induced inflammation in mice .intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammationthe mechanisms of action of the primary treatment op- tions for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation- mediating pathways cited above.

another provocative study suggested the formation of urate crystals studied ex vivo in circulating phagocytes of markedly hyperuri- cemic human blood volumetric analysis of articular urate crystal deposits by dect has suggested that there may be 'threshold ef- fects' for expression of the gouty arthritis phenotype with greater urate crystal deposit volume detectable in gouty joints compared to asymptomatic hyperuricemia however in patients with gout both exogenous and host factors are arrayed in opposition to promote'auto-inflammation' no clear protective immunity to urate crystals and cytokine-stimulated neutrophil-rich inflam- mation -.

dect ana- lyses demonstrate that tendon urate crystal deposits which resolve relatively slowly with aggressive urate-lowering therapy ult are a marker for symptomatic gout however 'early gout' defined as  3 years disease duration and well-established 'late gout' both with mean serum 7-7.5 mgdl have similar crystal volumes in joints novel findings using dect have further indicated thatin the absence of gout urate crystals deposit in costal cartilages and intervertebral disks in middle-aged men and at several sites of axial and peripheral joint in- volvement in spondyloarthropathy and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis patients nevertheless the mechanism and tissue effects of deposited urate crystals in these conditions are unknown.

urate crystals induce mir-155 in phagocytes and in turn elevated mir-155 levels increase the capacity of urate crystals to induce il-1b and tnf-a decreased sh2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase-1 has been shown to be implicated in this mechanism .effects of urate levels and crystal morphologyit is well-recognized that ult can precipitate more acute gout flares.

moreover hyperuricemia markedly increases the inflammatory po- tential of exogenous urate crystals in experimental gout in mice in vivo .a high level of soluble urate apart from promoting urate crystal deposition appears to exert a variety of prim- ing effects on inflammation -.

activated ampk markedly suppresses mononuclear phagocyte responses to urate crystals in vitro including nlrp3 inflammasome ac- tivation and il-1b and chemokine release ampk also promotes anti-inflammatory m2 macrophage polarization and autophagy  genetic ampk a1 chain deficiency markedly increases mouse inflammatory responses to urate crystals in vivo conversely a pharmacologic ampk activator suppresses experimental gout-like inflammation in vivo .caloric deprivation and exercise are among the factors that elevate tissue ampk activity levels by increasing the cellular ampatp ratio conversely ampk activity at the tissue level is inhibited by dietary intake of palmitate fructose and alcohol excess as well as by ex- posure of cells to il-1b tnf-a and urate crystals in vitro the impact of nutritional biosensing by ampk on gout is likely substantial in a disease marked by common metabolic co-morbidities and dietary excesses.

a striking ob- servation in several studies with each of these imaging modalities is that many of those with asymptomatic hyper- uricemia and not simply with very high levels of serum urate have evidence for urate crystal deposition in articu- lar as well as in certain periarticular tissue loci  .

for example in a recent study  first metatarsophalan- geal joint ultrasound was positive for urate crystal depos- ition in 36 of patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia defined as serum urate  6.9 mgdl but without sub- stantial evidence of synovitis and bone erosion.

individ- ual mediators and their effects on the gouty inflammation process are cited in table and discussed below.first signal nlrp3 inflammasome activatorsrecent discoveries illuminate the complex alignments of opposing endogenous and exogenous factors at several steps in the gouty inflammation process table the canonical nlrp3 inflammasome response to the 'second signal' provided by urate crystals requires 'first signal' priming events including increases in activation of nadph oxidase and nf-kb expression of pro-caspase-1 pro-il-1b and nlrp3 mrna and particle phagocytic capacity -certain first signal nlrp3 inflammasome acti- vators can promote and sustain chronic low-grade in- flammation clinically evident chronic synovitis in gout and acute inflammatory flares in response to deposited urate crystals.

this may be mediated by inflammatory effects through ult-induced changes in tissue urate equilibrium and remodeling of articular urate crystal deposits leading to greater accessibility of crystals to inflammatory cells.

urate crystals at sites of initial nucleation on templates of collagen and proteoglycan-rich connective tissues and urate crystals with a dense protein coating may have a dis- tinct inflammatory potential from crystals at sites of sec- ondary nucleation .

moreover elevated soluble urate suppresses mononuclear phagocyte autophagy and il-1ra expression and conversely activates multiple inflammatory pathways in mononuclear phagocytes including nf-kb activity and via the akt protein kinase b pathway and the proline- rich akt substrate 40 kda pras 40 activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin  soluble urate may also activate the nlrp3 inflammasome under hyp- oxic conditions .

circulating il-8cxcl8 has potential as a unique cytokine biomarker for gout in the period between flares in contrast neither routine acute phase reactants nor serum urate level have a clear role in assessing the inflammatory state in gout exemplified by increased early flares in ult and continuing chronic flares in many despite a sustained urate at the desired levels.

blood-borne phagocytes internalize urate microaggregates and prevent intravascular netosis by urate crystals.

the capacity of chronic gouty arthritis to cause joint damage and functional impairment further adds to the societal and financial impact of the disease.the pathogenesis of gouty inflammation is relatively well understood - it is known that urate crystals promote cleavage of c5 on their surface catalyzing the generation of c5a and c5b-9 involved in gouty inflamma- tion .
