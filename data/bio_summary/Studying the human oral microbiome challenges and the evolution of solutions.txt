The number of species residing in the human oral cavity ranges from 700 to over 1000.25CONTEMPORARY MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES TO PROFILE THE ORAL MICROBIOTACulture independent nucleic acid-based molecular analysis techniques are used for detecting and identify- ing individual or multiple bacteria bacterial commu- nity diversity and bacterial typing.20 Essentially molecular techniques need a macromolecule of inter- est DNA RNA or protein method-specific reagents automated sample handling such as those handled by robots and ideally a bioinformatics platform which allows computer-aided analyses of large molecular datasets to be carried out.29 The molecular techniques routinely used in oral microbiology are largely DNA- based and can be divided fundamentally into three broad categories namely i DNA hybridization ii PCR and iii DNA sequencing.

These niches include the teeth the gingival sulcus the tongue the floor of the mouth the cheek the hard and soft palates the ton- sils the throat and the saliva.25728 The most com- monly-used molecular research techniques used in oral molecular microbiological research include DNA hybridization polymerase chain reaction PCR and DNA sequencing.

In the past they were conducted as stand-alone techniques but at the present time PCRand DNA sequencing are invariably intertwined.A consequence of research using culture-independent approaches was the generation of thousands of sequences of cloned human oral bacterial 16S rRNA genes which were deposited into DNA sequence databases such as GenBank without any taxonomic reference points.

The probes used in the annealing process are either whole-genome DNA probes or short 15-30-base oligonucleotide probes with DNA sequences which complement their target sequence.2030Whole-genome probes are more likely to cross-react with non-target bacteria than the more specific oligonucleotide probes such as those binding to regions of the 16S rRNA gene.

The 16S rRNA gene enables precise taxonomic positioning of bacteria because in species with 70 or more genomic simi- larity the 16S rRNA gene is usually a more than 97 gene sequence match this is the universally- accepted cut-off for species assignment.203031 Hybridization techniques used in oral microbiological research include whole-genome checkerboard DNA- DNA hybridization reverse-capture oligonucleotide hybridization modification of the checkerboard method fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH and DNA microarray technology.

Table 1 presents a sum- mary of the principles applications advantages and limitations of these methods.Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was first described in 1994 by Socransky et al.32 In this tech- nique DNA standards representing the target species are immobilised on a nylon membrane in an array format then simultaneously cross-hybridized with usually radioactively-labelled genomic DNA probes.
