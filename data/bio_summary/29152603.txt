Of particular interest is the hindgut which contains cellulolytic bacteria 293031 as well as sequences similar to C. macrocephala which has been associated with waterlogged wood 6364 any relationship between these bacteria and fungi and their role in the fish GI tract remains to be determined.Combined with previous studies 29-32 our results indicate that bacteria and fungi co- inhabit the GI tract of P. nigrolineatus with the potential of degrading dietary wood.Ongoing studies 30 McDonald Watts and Schreier manuscript in preparation suggest that the enteric bacterial community may lack selected enzymatic activities essential for lignocellulolytic digestion which may be provided by the fungal community andor host.ITS1ITS2 sequences for several cellulase-producing fungi have been found in the present study including those having similarity with F. oxysporum A. pullulans Botrytis caroliniana Metschnikowia Alternaria and Debaryomyces.

Other sequences present throughout the GI tracts of both dietary regimens included Aureobasidium pullulans and Debaryomyces prosopidis both more abundant in wood-fed fish and Malassezia restricta.Relative distribution and diversity of fungi based on dietary regimenOTUs were binned into taxonomic groupings allowing comparison of fungal diversity within the GI tract of wood-fed fish and mixed-fed fish irrespective of GI tract region.

While we recognise that a rigorous analysis of the GI tract communities requires the utilisation of several fish we found that each GI tract region possessed a distinct fungal community and this is the first report of the presence of fungi throughout a fish GI tract.P.

It is likely that fungi play an important role in the fish microbiome yeasts have been identified as part of the normal microbiota of fish GI tract 43-47 and have been studied with specific relevance for fish health and yields in aquaculture.The GI tract of P. nigrolineatus is enriched with lignocellulose and provides a unique microenvironment.

Marden1 Ryan McDonald2 Harold J. Schreier23 and Joy E.M. Watts11School of Biological Sciences University of Portsmouth Portsmouth Hampshire UK2Department of Biological Sciences University of Maryland Baltimore County Baltimore MD USA3Department of Marine Biotechnology University of Maryland Baltimore County Baltimore MD USAAbstractThe Amazonian catfish Panaque nigrolineatus have several physiological adaptions enabling the scraping and consumption of wood xylivory facilitating a detritivorous dietary strategy.Composed of lignocellulose wood is a difficult substrate to degrade and as yet it is unclear whether the fish obtains any direct nutritional benefits from wood ingestion and degradation.

An OTU network was generated using the makeOTUnetwork.py script.The resulting network was visualized in Cytoscape 3.5.1 using a spring-embedded layout.ResultsDistribution and diversity of fungi in the GI tractFungal sequences corresponding to the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were PCR amplified from all GI tract regions of both diets.

An active nitrogen-fixing community has been identified in the GI tract of P. nigrolioneatus 32 suggesting that a mutualistic symbiosis between fungi and bacteria is possible within the fish GI tract.Confirmation of such a relationship will require further studies.Fungi are commercially important and play a critical role in global environmental health.

They may also provide nutritional benefits to wood degrading fungi via nitrogen fixation allowing fungi to decompose nitrogen-sparse wood 15.

Understanding the role of the fungal communities in lignocellulose degradation and their interaction with GI tract bacteria in this process is the focus of future studies.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Marden et al.Page 8AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation award 0801830 to JEMW and HJS.

This study is the first to examine the fungal community in a xylivorous fish and results support the hypothesis that diet influences fungal distribution and diversity within the gastrointestinal tract of P. nigrolineatus.Keywordsfungi microbiome symbiosis fish Panaque nigrolineatus gastrointestinal tract wood lignocelluloseLicensee AIMS Press.
