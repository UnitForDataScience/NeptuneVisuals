Here we studied the CVM in women exposed to Chlamydia trachomatis Ct. We included 98 women who were notified by Ct-positive sex partners via con- tact-tracing at the STI outpatient clinic in Amsterdam the Netherlands.

Although the bulk of the breakpoints yielded through the three different topologies did overlap to some degree a great deal of breakpoints varied greatly between the approaches.The cervico-vaginale microbiota in chlamydia trachomtais notified women a case-control study at the sexually transmitted infection outpatient clinic in AmsterdamCharlotte van der Veer1 S.M.

Cervico-vaginal samples and clinical data were collected for all women.

The CVM was characterized for 93 women of whom 52 were Ct positive and 41 Ct negative.

Women who tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis infection after having been contact- traced by a chlamydia positive partner were more likely to have CVM dominated by L. iners or by diverse anaerobic bacteria than by L. crispatus.Automated profiling of the human virome from raw metagenomic dataYumna Moosa12 Michael Vilsker3 Ewout Vanden Eyden4 Vagner Fonseca5 Sam Nooij6 Koen Deforche3 Tulio de Oliveira121Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine College of Health Sciences University of KwaZulu-Natal UKZN South Africa 2Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa CAPRISA UKZN South Africa 3Emweb Herent Belgium 4Rega Instituut KU Leuven Belgium 5Universidade do Estado da Bahia UNEB Brazil and 6Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu RIVM The NetherlandsViruses influence human health as conventional pathogens as modulators of gene expression and through their involvement in complex host-microbiome interactions.
