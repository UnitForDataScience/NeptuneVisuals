in addition pressure-overloaded heart failure can directly alter fecal flora in a guinea pig model without overt congestion indicating that heart failure could alone disrupt gut flora in absence of obesity genetics and other common risk factors .curr treat options cardio med 2017 19 27page 5 of 12 27of note studies have also found tmao levels higher in subjects with heart failure compared to subjects without heart failure with these higher levels portending increased risk of heart failure hospitalization and mortality   .

yet the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome as well as theiruniqueness within their individual hosts has made it difficult to study.in this review we will discuss current evidence relat- ing the gut microbiome to heart failure and the potential that lies in targeting the microbiome in order to lower these potential markers and thereby lower the risk for heart failure hf through several potential interven- tion strategies aimed at altering mechanistic pathways.characterizing the gut microbiome compositionmicrobiome analysis is an ever-growing evolving field that is working towards finding a more comprehensive explanation for the composition and function of the gut microbiome.

tmao presence can predict future development of chron- ic kidney disease and has been seen to be elevated in patients with established chronic kidney disease or in end-stage renal disease -.alterations in gut microbiome composition and function in heart failure early associations between gut microbiome and heart failurean association between systemic inflammation in heart failure and bacterial translocation has long been observed over the decades in which erythrocyte sedimentation rates and c-reactive proteins were some of the earliest biomarkers in heart failure.

since little is still known about the microbiome in relation to heart failure more investigation into the mechanism of microbiota and how this can affect andor lead to heart failure is necessary.27 page 10 of 12curr treat options cardio med 2017 19 27the current research has shown that there are three possible ways that microbiome and heart failure could be intertwined.

although no defined dysbiosis--change in microbiota composition--has been related to heart failure literature and studies worked towards further defining the relationship between the gut and heart failure.

gut microbiomes from 399 individuals of eight nationalities and of various age groups observed a core group of 267 genera across more than 50 of the gut microbiomes showing that there are some inherent similarities regardless of age ethnicity and diet .dietary-induced gut microbiota-derived metabolitesbecause the microbiome is expansive in nature focusing on certain aspects makes the task less daunting and can lead to understand certain roles of the microbiome.

since heart failure is closely linked to renal disease looking into interventional therapies with kidney patients could yield ways to clear tmao and lower heart failure risks.

by working for strong renal clearance tmao levels can be decreased and by association heart failure progression and risk could be monitored.along with kidney disease diabetes mellitus is also a comorbidity associated with heart failure.

one potential idea is using an oral binder to target the gut microbiota mechanism and possibly remove tmao and its precursors like tma from the gut.

as stated before lowering andor eliminating fmo3 expres- sion is unfavorable due to its side effects so looking into an alternative way to combat the diabetes and tmao relationship is warranted.conclusionunderstanding the contributions of the gut microbiome has proven to be challenging in part because this strategy does not account for host-microbial interactions within the various anatomic positions along the gut microbial ecosystem.

inaddition l-carnitine and cholinebetaine have also been found in association with higher cardiac risk but their values were in relation to concomitant- elevated tmao levels making tmao a primary target to better understand the relationship of metabolite to heart failure.

the thought is that a community of good microorganisms administered to a diseased intestine can restore balance and function by transplanting low- producing tmao fecal microbiota a patient at risk for or with heart failure could have a way to lower or eliminate their excess tmao.

furthermore levels of lps in the hepatic vein of patients with heart failure were higher versus other circulatory regions like pulmonary artery and left ventricle  suggesting that heart failure exacerbation may be precipitated by endotoxin translocation from the bowel to the blood- stream.

further heart failure has such a high comorbidity with other conditions like renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus that by working and improving these underlying conditions the risk or progression of heart failure could also be positively affected.
