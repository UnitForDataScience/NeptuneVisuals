Yet the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome as well as theiruniqueness within their individual hosts has made it difficult to study.In this review we will discuss current evidence relat- ing the gut microbiome to heart failure and the potential that lies in targeting the microbiome in order to lower these potential markers and thereby lower the risk for heart failure HF through several potential interven- tion strategies aimed at altering mechanistic pathways.Characterizing the gut microbiome compositionMicrobiome analysis is an ever-growing evolving field that is working towards finding a more comprehensive explanation for the composition and function of the gut microbiome.

TMAO presence can predict future development of chron- ic kidney disease and has been seen to be elevated in patients with established chronic kidney disease or in end-stage renal disease -.Alterations in gut microbiome composition and function in heart failure Early associations between gut microbiome and heart failureAn association between systemic inflammation in heart failure and bacterial translocation has long been observed over the decades in which erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive proteins were some of the earliest biomarkers in heart failure.

One potential idea is using an oral binder to target the gut microbiota mechanism and possibly remove TMAO and its precursors like TMA from the gut.

As stated before lowering andor eliminating FMO3 expres- sion is unfavorable due to its side effects so looking into an alternative way to combat the diabetes and TMAO relationship is warranted.ConclusionUnderstanding the contributions of the gut microbiome has proven to be challenging in part because this strategy does not account for host-microbial interactions within the various anatomic positions along the gut microbial ecosystem.

The healthy human gut microbiomeWe have learned that the majority of bacteria in most human's gut microbiota are from two phyla Firmicutes and Bacterioidetes   the other less abundant come from phyla such as Actinobacteria Proteobacteria Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia.

Gut microbiomes from 399 individuals of eight nationalities and of various age groups observed a core group of 267 genera across more than 50 of the gut microbiomes showing that there are some inherent similarities regardless of age ethnicity and diet .Dietary-induced gut microbiota-derived metabolitesBecause the microbiome is expansive in nature focusing on certain aspects makes the task less daunting and can lead to understand certain roles of the microbiome.

The gut microbiota converts dietary nutrients such as phosphatidylcholine choline or L-carnitine as part of their own nutrient sources into trimethylamine TMA which is then excreted or absorbed by the host and converted to TMAO via hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases FMOs .

Inaddition L-carnitine and cholinebetaine have also been found in association with higher cardiac risk but their values were in relation to concomitant- elevated TMAO levels making TMAO a primary target to better understand the relationship of metabolite to heart failure.

In addition pressure-overloaded heart failure can directly alter fecal flora in a guinea pig model without overt congestion indicating that heart failure could alone disrupt gut flora in absence of obesity genetics and other common risk factors .Curr Treat Options Cardio Med 2017 19 27Page 5 of 12 27Of note studies have also found TMAO levels higher in subjects with heart failure compared to subjects without heart failure with these higher levels portending increased risk of heart failure hospitalization and mortality   .

One of the greatest environmental exposures to the gut is what we eat making our diet a prime example of a way the composition of the gut can be altered.
