Although the effects of gut microbiota on the host are complex this pattern of gut microbiota differences indicates that the Sebago population has advantageous gut microbiota relative to the LaHave population across the competition treatments and may thus reflect a higher interspecific competition tolerance in the Sebago population  .The Sebago population exhibited significantly higher spe- cies richness in gut microbiota than the LaHave population across all treatments.

There were six treatments for each Atlantic salmon pop- ulation Table  Atlantic salmon reared alone 32 Atlantic salmon Atlantic salmon reared in a 11 ratio with one of the four non-native species 16 Atlantic salmon and 16 one of the non-native species and Atlantic salmon reared with all the four species combined 16 Atlantic salmon four Chinook salmon four coho salmon four rainbow trout and four brown trout.

Gut microbiota were assessed in the Atlantic salmon onlyTherefore we expected that the interspecific competition treatments should result in a range of competitive effects on the Atlantic salmon gut microbiota when they competed for food and microhabitats.At the end of July 2013 after 10 months in the artificial stream tanks six to nine Atlantic salmon from each tank were randomly collected and humanely euthanized by an overdose of buffered MS-222.

The likely mechanism for this loss of probiotic bacteria in the LaHave Atlantic salmon is competition-related stress as previous studies showed that stress decreases the abundance of Lactobacillus in human and monkey gut microbiota  .Given the impact of interspecific competition on the gut microbiota in the LaHave Atlantic salmon it was surprising that we did not detect any significant increase in the genera which includes pathogenic bacteria e.g.

This difference may thus represent locally adaptive host- microbiota relationships given the role of the gut microbiota in fish health.The gut microbiota plays an important role in the health of their host and the gut contains both beneficial bacteria and opportunistic pathogens .

However the effect of interspecific competition on the gut microbiota has not been explored in any species.To explore the role of interspecific competition in deter- mining gut microbial community composition and to test for evidence for competition response differences between source populations for Atlantic salmon reintroduction we conducted interspecific competition experiments using two Atlantic salmon populations.

Clearly changes in the composition and diversity of gut microbiota can affect the health of the host and the intestinal environment provided by the host can in turn affect the com- position and dynamics of the gut microbial community as well.Although the community structure of the fish gut microbi- ota is the result of complex interactions between the bacteria and their host  many external factors also can affect theElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article doi contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.
