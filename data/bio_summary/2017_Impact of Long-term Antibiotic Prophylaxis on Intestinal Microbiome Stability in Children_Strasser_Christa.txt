If important confounders are identified the study will be extended to more patients.To date 19 out of the planned 20 patients have been included and six complete sets of stool samples are avail- able for preliminary analysis 9 patients in group 1 who have received antibiotic prophylaxis and 10 patients in group 2 who serve as the control group.This study will help in gaining a better understanding of the implications of early-life antibiotic use in children receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in their first year of life or until definitive therapy for certain congenital pathologies of the urinary tract including VUR and megaureters.Conflicts of interest The authors have nothing to disclose.

We are prospectively including term-born vaginally delivered children aged 1 yr. Possible influencing factors such as duration of breastfeeding complementary food and first solid food intake as well as the delivery mode and patient characteristics such as age sex weight underlying urological malformations circumcision status in boys and dietary variations will be recorded.Those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis second-genera- tion cephalosporin cefaclor for at least 3 months because of a urological malformations vesicoureteral reflux VUR andor megaureters are included in group 1.

Children with urogenital malformations who do not receive antibiotic prophylaxis serve as control group group 2.Baseline stool samples will be collected before antibiotic treatment.

Our aim is to analyze possible differences in the composition and functionality of the developing micro- biome in children with urogenital malformations who do or do not receive long-term antibiotic prophylaxis as part oftheir treatment in the first year of life.

During the first year of life stool samples will be prospectively collected by parents and will be stored in the household freezer until the next urological appointment .Final 16s RNA sequencing and analysis of short-chain fatty acids as an indicator of bacterial functionality will be performed at the Department of Pathology at Medical Uni- versity Graz.Owing to the prospective design of this study and the lack of data it is not feasible to estimate group size by means of a statistical power calculation.

The dynamic inter- play between the host and the gut microbial community stabilizes during the first 3 yr of life before reaching an adult-like state .

Changes in the intestinal microbiome are linked to metabolic and immune-related diseases such as allergic asthma and obesity and are there- fore of great interest .To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first to investigate the specific effects of long-term antibi- otic treatment.

A Cox analysis is planned to evaluate the influence of prophylaxis with reference to gender and age.
