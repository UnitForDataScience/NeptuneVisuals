if important confounders are identified the study will be extended to more patients.to date 19 out of the planned 20 patients have been included and six complete sets of stool samples are avail- able for preliminary analysis 9 patients in group 1 who have received antibiotic prophylaxis and 10 patients in group 2 who serve as the control group.this study will help in gaining a better understanding of the implications of early-life antibiotic use in children receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in their first year of life or until definitive therapy for certain congenital pathologies of the urinary tract including vur and megaureters.conflicts of interest the authors have nothing to disclose.
