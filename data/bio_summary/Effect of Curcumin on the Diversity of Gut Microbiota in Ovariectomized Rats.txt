we speculated that the increased firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio plays an important role in overweight ovx rats.at the genus level compared to ovx group rats the abundance of incertaesedis anaerovorax anaerotruncus and helicobacter in the gut of the sham group rats and the abundance of serratia anaerotruncus shewanella pseudomonas papillibacter exiguobacterium and helicobacter in the gut of the cur group rats changed significantly.

at the phyla level compared to sham rats model rats had a higher ratio of phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes in the gut which may lead to overweight rats at the genus level curcumin could lower the increasing abundance of the genera anaerotruncus and helicobacter in the gut of model rats.acknowledgments this study was supported by beijing natural science foundation no.

the ovx group had a lower richness index chao 746 and ace 825.70 and higher evenness index shannon 7.16 and simpson 0.980 than the sham group chao 776 ace 878.71 shannon 7.00and simpson 0.972 and cur group chao 762 ace 847.71 shannon 7.00 and simpson 0.975. these results suggested that the ovx group had lower level of biodiversity and higher evenness than the sham group and cur group table .table 1. estimation of diversity within fecal samples from the three groups.analysis of differential gut microbiotatwelve phyla and 56 genera in total were found between the three groups.

in conclusion estrogen deficiency induced by ovariectomy caused changes in the distribution and structure of intestinal microflora in rats and curcumin could partially reverse changes in the diversity of gut microbiota.keywords menopause ovariectomy rat curcumin gut microbiotaintroductionmenopause is a natural process that all women will go through usually accompanied by some physiological and psychological changes including bone loss weight gain depression nervousness etc.

further research on the relationship between menopause curcumin and helicobacter in the gut is necessary.conclusionsthis study is the first to reveal the effect of curcumin on the diversity of gut microbiota in a menopausal rat model using high-throughput sequencing technology.

the percentage of shared otus was 86.1603. gut microbiota of rats from the sham or cur group had higher levels of biodiversity and unevenness estimations than those from the ovx group.

in the present study compared to sham rats the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes in the gut of the ovx group were significantly increased and decreased respectively.

female wistar rats were subjected to either ovariectomy or a sham operation sham group.

the protocol involving animals in this study was authorized by the institutional ethics committee of china academy of chinese medical sciences approval number 2016-017. the sham operation n  6 sham group or bilateral ovx n  12 using a dorsal incision as we reported previously  was performed on the rats after acclimatization.

however the effects of curcumin on gut microfloral communities of ovariectomized ovx rats remains unclear.
