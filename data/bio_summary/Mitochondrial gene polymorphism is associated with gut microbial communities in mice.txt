Since common inbred mouse strains demonstrate unique mitochondrial genomes-and the mitochondria are strictly maternally inherited we systematically generated conplastic strains carrying mostly single mutations in mtDNA with a C57BL6J nuclear background by repeatedly back- crossing female mitochondrial-donor strains with male C57BL6J mice over 12 generations.

Given the marked dif- ferences of microbiota between C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ and the two other mouse strains we next characterized C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ mice which carry a mutation in the mitochondrially-encoded ATP synthase 8 gene mt-Atp8 with respect to their general and cellular metabolic phenotypes.Using a separate cohort of mice than those included in the gut microbiota analysis we first weighed C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ and C57BL6J mice at 3 6 12 18 and 24 months of age.

C57BL6J and C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ mice also significantly differed in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes P  0.0230 Kruskal-Wallis test Dunn test Padj 0.0111 which was higher in C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ mice than in C57BL6J mice Fig.

However significant strain-dependent differences were also apparent characterized by C57BL6J mice differing from C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ mice in the abundance of Bacteroidetes Deferribacteres Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Tenericutes Mann-Whitney U test Padj 0.05 and from C57BL6J-mtNZBBlnJ mice in the abundance of Deferribacteres and Tenericutes Padj  0.05.

C57BL6J mice significantly differed from C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ mice in the abundance of Anaeroplasmataceae Bacteroidales S24-7 group Deferribacteraceae Desulfovibrionaceae and Helicobacteraceae MWU-test Padj 0.05 and from C57BL6J-mtNZBBlnJ mice in Anaeroplasmataceae Padj 0.0468 Supplementary Table S1.

Conplastic strains were maintained by repeated backcrossing female conplastic offspring with male C57BL6J mice which were randomly selected from the C57BL6J colony maintained in the same breeding facility room.

The mitochondrial Atp8 mutation induces mitochondrial ROS generation secretory dysfunction and b-cell mass adaptation in conplastic B6-mtFVB mice.

None of the three strains significantly differ in alpha diversity Padj 0.05 Mann-Whitney U tests.Next to characterize diversity between strains beta diversity was analyzed using the unweighted UniFracdistance metric revealing significant differences between strains Kruskal-Wallis test P  0.0252.

For each individual 12500 contigs were randomly selected and clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units OTUs yielded 4853 OTUs after excluding singletons see Material and methods.At the level of phylum abundances the gut microbiota of conplastic mouse strains was similar to previ- ously described studies of C57BL6J mice with Bacteroidetes being most abundant followed by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria Table .

To test for differences between all three strains Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed and Dunn tests were applied as post-hoc tests with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing.Phenotyping of C57BL6J and C57BL6J-mtFVBNJ mice.
