The pgdb sub-directory contains a osampleID.pwy.txt file describing metabolic pathways predicted in the ePGDB specifically each predicted pathway the ORF identities involved in each pathway the enzyme abundance and the pathway coverage in a tabular format navigable via the METAPATHWAYS GUI.genbankThis directory contains a file named osampleID.annotated.gff a GFF file containing all quality-controlled sequences with their annotations.ptoolsThis directory contains the three files necessary to build a ePGDB using PATHWAY TOOLS 1 genetic- elements.dat 2 organism-params.dat and 3 0.pf which contains all functional annotations to be processed by PATHWAY TOOLS.

While there is no guarantee that in a complex milieu such as the gut microbiome the syntrophic flux will necessarily follow a short and minimal energy path these criteria allow us to narrow down a multiplicity of possible paths to a single parsimonious candidate path.In a study by Koeth et al.

Using this biotransformation as a motivating case we queried an arbitrarily selected ePGDB from the GUTCYC COLLECTION SRS015217CYC for the biochemical reaction path from L-carnitine to TMA which is not provided explicitly by Koeth et al.Utilizing the PATHWAY TOOLS Metabolic Route Search feature we found an optimal path between L-carnitine to TMA for this ePGDB using the METACYC carnitine degradation II pathway PWY-3602 expected in Proteobacteria along with a betaine reductase reaction EC 1.21.4.4 found in Clostridium sticklandii and Eubacterium acidaminophilum both species affiliated with the order Clostridiales minimizing the number of enzymes involved and chemical bond rearrangements.
