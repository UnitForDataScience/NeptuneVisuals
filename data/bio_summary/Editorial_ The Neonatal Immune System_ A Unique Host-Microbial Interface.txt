in this section the microbiome and the influence of feeding early in life are reviewed with an emphasis on its influence in developing mucosal immunity.early life host-microbiome interphase the key frontier for immune developmentsummarize the interaction of the immune system with the microbiome in early life as a critical window of susceptibility for life long disease as well as an opportunity to protect and promote life-long health.starter feeding supplementation alters colonic mucosal bacterial communities and modulates mucosal immune homeostasis in newborn lambsan original study performed by shows that starter feeding altered colonic mucosal bacterial composition and modulated mucosal immune homeostasis including tlr4 transcript as well as tnf-a and ifn-g during the milk-feeding period in lambs.innate immunity and breast milkthe ability of human milk to provide optimal growth and devel- opment to the newborn in ways that formula cannot has become increasingly apparent.

in this review focus on bioactive components of human milk that contribute to the developing innate immune system through unique and fascinat- ing mechanisms including shaping the intestinal microbiome diminishing inflammation and providing pluripotent human milk stem cells that may have a role in tissue regeneration in the breastfed infant.the role of mucosal immunity in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitisin this review describe the cellular components of the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune system as well as their relationship to nec.

this research topic focuses on the immune system of the newborn as one such organ system.

the articles herein are original research or review articles that discuss some aspect of the neonatal immune system andor the pathogens against which the system has evolved to defend.

2 characteristics of specific immune cell subsets that differ in the neonatal period relative to other life stages.

they also discuss the relationship between the gut microbiota and cell signaling that underpins disease pathogenesis and highlight notable therapeutic advance- ments in nec that target intestinal mucosal immunity.section 2 neonatal innate and adaptive immunityalthough historically considered immature deficient or dys- functional more recent study of individual cellular components of the innate and adaptive immune system suggest that the altera- tions in function that are characteristic of neonatal cells reflect an evolutionarily adaptive phenotype rather than an immature one.

this section combines reviews and some original research into these phenomena.age-appropriate functions and dysfunctions of the neonatal neutrophilreview that neutrophils are no longer viewed as short-lived indiscriminate phagocytes of the immune system but instead as essential components necessary for proper b and t cell function antigen presentation and tissue repair and regeneration.

however using knockout mice they show cd8 cells were not necessary for the development of protectivememory in neonates since they were dispensable for survival of secondary infection.comparison of the functional microrna expression in immune cell subsets of neonates and adultspresent novel systematic and functional mirna profiles of neonate cord blood and adult leukocyte subsets.

these stud- ies serve as a basis to further understand the altered immune response observed in neonates and advance the development of therapeutic strategies.section 3 neonatal sepsis meningitis and vaccinesneonatal sepsis and meningitis continue to carry a high burden of mortality and morbidity among those affected.

the findings further define unique aspects of the murine antigen response in the early postnatal period that may be more accurately described as adapted to early life rather than immature.section 4 neonatal fungal infectionsantifungal immunological defenses in newbornspresent a review of the developing innate and adaptive immune responses of newborns specifically as they may relate to susceptibility to fungal infections.

although much has been learned about the developing immune system in neonates and its relation to risk for infections much less has been devoted to fungi as targets of host-defense.
