Finally we were unable to iden- tify any taxa that correlate with blood nitrate or nitrite levels or bone status including cancellous BVTV in proximal tibia metaphysis cortical volume in tibia diaphysis or total tibia BMD.Figure 3. a Principal coordinates analysis using weighted UniFrac distance on 16S sequences from fecal microbiota of sham blue and OVX red rats showing there are distinct phylogenetic differences in the gut microbiome between sham and OVX rats Adonis R2  0.17 p  0.017 b Principal coordinates analysis using weighted UniFrac distance on 16S sequences from fecal microbiota of OVX red low purple and high green dose nitrate treated rats shows no distinct phylogenetic differences in the gut microbiome between OVX controls and OVX rats supplemented with nitrate.

Total daily nitrate intakes were not significantly dif- ferent between OVX and sham while LDN and HDN groups had significantly higher total nitrate intake compared to OVX vehicle.Figure 1. a OVX had no effect on blood nitrate levels and increasing dietary nitrate resulted in increased blood nitrate levels and b OVX had no effect on blood nitrite levels compared to sham while significantly increased blood nitrite levels were observed in the OVX-HDN treatment group.

Dietary nitrate had no effects on BMC and BMD in total tibia on cancellous bone in the proximal tibial metaphysis or proximal tibial epiphysis and on cortical bone in the tibial diaphysis in ovariectomized Sprague Dawley ratsBMC g20.364 - 0.0090.373 - 0.0150.361 - 0.0080.366 - 0.0101.000BMD gcm 0.1520.0050.1420.0030.1420.0020.1430.0031.000 microComputed TomographyProximal Tibia Epiphysis cancellous boneBone VolumeTissue Volume 43.521.4737.141.12a38.421.12a37.501.15a0.041Trabecular Number 1mm5.130.194.540.114.690.124.690.180.540Trabecular Thickness um9839529529421.000Trabecular Spacing um18262126202520870.088Proximal Tibia Metaphysis cancellous boneBone VolumeTissue Volume 28.953.2214.141.09a14.771.72a14.311.24a0.003Trabecular Number 1mm5.440.263.930.22a3.970.15a3.780.2a0.003Trabecular Thickness um7136426326310.446Trabecular Spacing um1681025216a24410a26115a0.003Midshaft Tibia cortical boneCross-Sectional Volume mm35.96 - 0.196.43 - 0.266.05 - 0.156.19 - 0.141.000Cortical Volume mm34.56 - 0.144.93 - 0.174.73 - 0.124.78 - 0.111.000Marrow Volume mm31.40 - 0.071.50 - 0.101.32 - 0.041.41 - 0.061.000Cortical Thickness um654 - 13676 - 10677 - 14673 - 111.000Ipolar mm45.96 - 0.377.06 - 0.556.20 - 0.296.44 - 0.291.000Data are mean SEDifferent than sham p  0.05Different than OVX control p  0.05Different than low NO3 p  0.05The Benjamini-Hochberg method for maintaining the family-wise error rate at 5 was used to adjust for multiple comparisons BMC bone mineral content BMD bone mineral densityRats were ovariectomized at 6 months of age and treated with one of two doses of nitrate for three weeks.cortical area marrow area or cortical thickness were not detected between OVX LDN and HDN groups.Effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on serum biochemical markers of bone turnoverThe effects of OVX and dietary nitrate supplementation on serum biochemical markers of bone resorption CTx and bone formation osteocalcin are show in Fig.

3E and F. There were no significant differences in osteocalcin or CTx levels between OVX vehicle group LDN or HDN.Effects of ovariectomy and dietary nitrate supplementation on fecal microbiota compositionIn order to identify possible gut microbiota signatures with OVX or dietary nitrate we compared the fecal microbiota composition of sham rats to OVX rats treated with vehicle LDN or HDN.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the ability of dietary nitrate to improve NO bioavailability reduce bone turnover and loss as well as alter the fecal microbiome composition using an OVX rat model.Materials and methodsExperimental designA total of 40 six-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats 30 ovariectomized OVX and 10 sham-operated sham at 5.5 month of age were purchased from Charles River Labora- tory Hollister California.

All OVX groups had significantly increased body weight and decreased uterine weight compared to sham controls with no differences ob- served between OVX LDN and HDN groups.

There were no significant differences in food intake between OVX and sham or OVX vehicle LDN and HDN groups.

In the proximal tibia epiphysis OVX resulted in significantly lower BVTV and no significant differences in OVX on trabecular number trabecular separation or trabec- ular thickness compared to sham.

Significant differences in cortical endpoints cross-sectional area cortical area marrow area or cortical thickness were not detected between OVX and sham.Histological analyses of proximal tibia metaphysis re- vealed the OVX vehicle group had significantly higher min- eral apposition rate mineralizing perimeter bone formation rate and osteoclast perimeter compared to sham controls Fig.

We found a trend of increases in Proteobacteria abundance in the OVX rats Bon- ferroni adjusted p  0.052 whereas Firmicutes were more abundant in the sham rats Bonferroni adjusted p  0.015.We also observed a non-significant increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes in OVX animals Bonferroni adjusted p  0.12.
