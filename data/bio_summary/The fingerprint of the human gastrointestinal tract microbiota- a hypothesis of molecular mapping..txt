the intestinal microbiota of each individual have a specific complement of hundreds of genera and thousands of bacterial species 1. conventional microbiological techniques fail to give a detailed inventory of the normal microbiota but the development of recent high-throughput sequencing and high level molecular taxonomic methodologies have greatly increased our understanding of the microbiota population composition dynamics and ecology 2.the composition of intestinal flora is remarkably stable at different anatomic locations along the gut but absolute numbers vary greatly ranging from 1011 cellsg in the ascending colon to 107-108 in the distal ileum and 102 to 103 in the proximal ileum and jejunum 1 3.it is also well documented that intestinal microbiota play a critical role in the maintenance of host intestinal barrier homeostasis by exerting beneficial effects on diverse physiological intestinal functions while dysbiosis can lead to progression of inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease ibd and colorectal cancer crc 4 5.a well balanced gut microbiota promotes the health of colocytes through the production of a variety of important compounds and the correct modulation of the immune system 2.along this line probiotics pbs have been used and some studies have suggested three mechanisms for their action in ibd therapy they may i block the pathogenic bacterial effect and compete withpathogenic toxins for adherence to the intestinal epithelium ii enhance innate immunity and modulate inflammation through their regulated signaling pathways via their interaction with toll-like receptors and iii enhance intestinal barrier function and thus regulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis.

intestinal microbiota play a critical role in the maintenance of the host intestinal barrier homeostasis while dysbiosis which involves reduction in the microbiome diversity can lead to progression of inflammatory disorders such as ibd and colorectal cancer.

human intestinal microbiota are extensive with at least 15000-36000 bacterial species.

these techniques provide individual data and profiles using fast and sensitive tools for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota and provide estimation of the relative presence of the microbial target groups within each individual.

the human intestinal tract hosts about 100 trillion microorganisms with at least 15000-36000 bacterial species.

moreover pbs modulate different host cell signaling pathways such as akt mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear-kappa b that could potentially mediate intestinal epithelial functions 6.some bacteria such as lactobacillus delbruekii and lactobacillus fermentum have been documented to ameliorate the inflammatory background.

in fact thecomposition of the adult intestinal microbiota has been determined in 3 large scale 16srrna sequence surveys.

the htf microbi-array enables specific detection and approximate relative quantification of 16s rrna from 30 phylogenetically-related groups of human intestinal microbiota.

rflp is culture independent rapid sensitive and reproducible without theneed for any genomic sequence information.real time polymerase chain reaction pcr is a powerful method for amplyfing particular segments of dna distinct from cloning and propagation within the host cell this technique uses the oligonucleotide as a primer and elongates its 3' end to generate an extended region of double stranded dna.human intestinal tract chip hit chip is a 16srrna gene-based diversity microarray which was developed and validated for the characterisation of human gut microbiota.

it is an oligonucleotide microarray commonly used for phylogenetic profiling 13 14.resultsthanks to such advances of the 16s ribosomal rna genomic sequencing a decrease in bacteroides and firmicutes numbers in the colon and an increase in enterobacteriaceae such as adherent-invasive e. coli and other proteobacteria have been detected in crohn's disease 5 12.moreover the hit chip technology which is a 16srrna gene based diversity for phylogenetic profiling of human intestinal tract communities 15 and the pyrosequencing have been developed to serve as a more economic sequencing approach than high-coverage amplicon sequencing to study many complex bacterial ecosystems.the data emanating from many techniques intersect and could sometimes be complementary in determining microbial community profiling.

in this context could a molecular mapping or fingerprinting of intestinal microbiota provide convincing evidence regarding its role in causing maintaining andor determining the severity of ibdsearlier studies whether experimental in animals or clinical in patients are in support of such an approach.
