In our hands the learning index of wild-type C. elegans N2 when exposed for 4 hr to wild-type PA14 and subsequent avoidance of PA14 were similar to what was previously reported   B learning index train test for PA14- PA14  0.4624.Then we utilized the learning assay to determine whether virulence factors of PA14 that affect the ability of PA14 to pro- liferate in the intestine of C. elegans  areCell Reports 20 2501-2512 September 5 2017 a 2017 The Authors.

Worms trained with PA14 or virulence-compromised PA14 were tested with OP50 and PA14 or virulence-compromised PA14.Choice indexes of worms exposed to OP50 naive were not significantly different.

Learning indexes of worms trained on virulence-compromised PA14 showed no aversive learning behavior upon the test plate with PA14 or virulence-compromised PA14 gacA-PA14 gac-A-gacA lasR-PA14 and lasR-lasR unpaired two-tailed t test.p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 and p  0.0001 n.s non-significant.

The fat content of both wild-type N2 and ins-11 mutant animals decreased at a similar rate on plates with small PA14 lawns Tukey's multiple comparisons test.When we compared the reduced amount of fat on OP50 to PA14 fat content decreased faster in ins-11 mutant animals than in wild-type N2 worms two-tailed unpaired t test.After a 12-hr incubation on PA14 small lawns ins-11 mutant animals laid fewer hatched eggs than wild-type N2 worms.

Worms were put on OP50 or PA14 or non-virulent PA14 mutant strains and then washed and put on the testing plates.

Instead worms that were trained with PA14 had significantly different choice indexes than worms trained with virulence-compromised PA14.

p values are for each condition compared to OP50-PA14 naive or PA14-PA14 trained Dunnett's test.Learning indexes of worms trained on PA14 had a learning index on the test plate similar to that of worms on virulence-compromised PA14 PA14-PA14 PA14- gacA or PA14-lasR.

In this series of experiments when we trained C. elegans on the PA14 mutant strains DgacA or DlasR which have been shown to have compromised virulence on C. elegans   we could reproduce a previous report   with PA14 DgacA mutant and found that both non-virulent mutant strains could not induce aversive learning behavior  B DgacA-DgacA  0.1312 DgacA-PA14  0.1392 DlasR- DlasR  -0.1081 and DlasR-PA14  -0.0353.

Interestingly nematodes trained on wild-type PA14 also avoided the non- virulent PA14 mutant strains DgacA B PA14-DgacA  0.3509 and DlasR B PA14-DlasR  0.3221.

Moreover without being trained on pathogenic PA14 worms failed to avoid path- ogenic PA14.
