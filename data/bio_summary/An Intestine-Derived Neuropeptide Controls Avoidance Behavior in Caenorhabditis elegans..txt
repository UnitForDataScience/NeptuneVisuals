in our hands the learning index of wild-type c. elegans n2 when exposed for 4 hr to wild-type pa14 and subsequent avoidance of pa14 were similar to what was previously reported   b learning index train test for pa14- pa14  0.4624.then we utilized the learning assay to determine whether virulence factors of pa14 that affect the ability of pa14 to pro- liferate in the intestine of c. elegans  arecell reports 20 2501-2512 september 5 2017 a 2017 the authors.

in this series of experiments when we trained c. elegans on the pa14 mutant strains dgaca or dlasr which have been shown to have compromised virulence on c. elegans   we could reproduce a previous report   with pa14 dgaca mutant and found that both non-virulent mutant strains could not induce aversive learning behavior  b dgaca-dgaca  0.1312 dgaca-pa14  0.1392 dlasr- dlasr  -0.1081 and dlasr-pa14  -0.0353. interestingly nematodes trained on wild-type pa14 also avoided the non- virulent pa14 mutant strains dgaca b pa14-dgaca  0.3509 and dlasr b pa14-dlasr  0.3221. these results indicate that once nematodes were ''trained'' by wild- type pathogenic bacteria even non-pathogenic mutant strains dgaca and dlasr evoked avoidance suggesting that nema- todes are responding to an olfactory signal.

learning indexes of worms trained on virulence-compromised pa14 showed no aversive learning behavior upon the test plate with pa14 or virulence-compromised pa14 gaca-pa14 gac-a-gaca lasr-pa14 and lasr-lasr unpaired two-tailed t test.p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 and p  0.0001 n.s non-significant.

because aversive learning behavior in this organ- ism is triggered by prolonged r4 hr exposure to pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa  and the intestine is the organ where pathogenic microbes typi- cally accumulate we hypothesized that a signal from the in- testine influences neuronal cells that regulate aversive learning behavior.resultsvirulent factors are critical for aversive learning behaviorin order to study communication between the intestine and neurons and identify potential relaying molecules in c. elegans we implemented a two-choice preference assay to evaluate aversive olfactory learning behavior based on the approach detailed in .

worms trained with pa14 or virulence-compromised pa14 were tested with op50 and pa14 or virulence-compromised pa14.choice indexes of worms exposed to op50 naive were not significantly different.

ins-11 promoter gfp intensity analysis showed that the gfp in- tensity was significantly decreased by pmk-1 rnai upon expo- sure to pa14 than the gfp intensity of rnai control upon op50  unpaired two-tailed t test p  0.0001. although this is unlikely to happen within the 4 hr of exposure to pa14 we were not able to exclude the possibility that pronounced sick- ness which is associated with compromised immunity by pmk-1 rnai  and widening of the intestinal lumen caused by enhanced proliferation of pa14 in the gut  might have affected the size of nematodes as well as the gfp signal.

the fat content of both wild-type n2 and ins-11 mutant animals decreased at a similar rate on plates with small pa14 lawns tukey's multiple comparisons test.when we compared the reduced amount of fat on op50 to pa14 fat content decreased faster in ins-11 mutant animals than in wild-type n2 worms two-tailed unpaired t test.after a 12-hr incubation on pa14 small lawns ins-11 mutant animals laid fewer hatched eggs than wild-type n2 worms.

p values are for each condition compared to op50-pa14 naive or pa14-pa14 trained dunnett's test.learning indexes of worms trained on pa14 had a learning index on the test plate similar to that of worms on virulence-compromised pa14 pa14-pa14 pa14- gaca or pa14-lasr.

these results indicate that pa14 virulence traitsare essential to nematodes in order to develop aversive learning behavior.aversive learning behavior can be modified by a signal that is mediated by a neuropeptidesince virulence traits are expressed from microbes in the intes- tinal lumen  it is reasonable to assume that in- testinal cells might be able to sense these signals first during the interaction between c. elegans and p. aeruginosa and inform other tissues.

in confirmatory experiments knockdown of ins-11 in the intestine-specific rnai strain mgh167 as well as a deletion mutant of ins-11tm1053 resulted in increased learning indexes c. these results demonstrate that ins-11 of the intestine negatively regulates aversive learning behavior.expression of ins-11 is increased in the intestine by exposure to pa14 and regulated by hlh-30 and the p38 mapk pathwayto further study how the expression of ins-11 in the intestine changes during exposure to p. aeruginosa we tested the levels of ins-11 rna transcript using qpcr and by studying thec.

in addition our finding that viru- lence-attenuated pa14 gaca or lasr mutant strains could not induce aversive learning behavior along with previous studies showing that these strains are unable to colonize the intestine of c. elegans  indicates that coloniza- tion of a pathogen in the intestinal lumen constitutes the two axes of aversive learning behavior with toxins of the pathogen.we also showed that the jnk-like mapk pathway did not stimulate the transcription of ins-11.

we found that inhibiting the expression of the neuropeptide-converting enzyme egl-3 which is also expressed in the intestine  resulted in an increased learning index learningfigure 2. intestinal ins-11 controls aversive learning behaviorchoice index and learning index of animals after intestine-restricted knockdown of potential intestine-neuronal signal transmitters are shown.

the finding that aversive learning behavior can be increased by the inhibition of neuropeptide- modifying enzymes in the intestine suggests that remem- brance of a noxious environment can be modified by neuro- peptides and further supported the hypothesis that intestinal neuropeptides play a suppressive role in the aversive learning behavior.ins-11 in the intestine negatively controls aversive learning behaviorin c. elegans 113 genes encode potential neuropeptides  and play a critical role in worm physiology and immune activ- ity .

when we evalu- ated the learning index after knockdownof neuropeptides figure s1 we found that only knockdown of ins-11 significantly increased the learning index c control rnai in n2 learning index  0.4040 ins-11 rnai  0.7506 in wild- type n2 nematodes.

worms were put on op50 or pa14 or non-virulent pa14 mutant strains and then washed and put on the testing plates.
