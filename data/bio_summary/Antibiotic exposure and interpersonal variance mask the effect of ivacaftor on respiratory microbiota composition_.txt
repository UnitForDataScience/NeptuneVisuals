We were able to detect no differences between ivacaftor and placebo treatment in terms of either change in microbiota composition or in change in total or pseudomonal load.While the airway microbiota of individuals with CF has been shown to be relatively stable over long periods of time  substantial differences in composition exist between patients .

Sputum microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR at five key time points along with regular clinical review respiratory function assessment and peripheral blood testing.Results No significant difference in microbiota composition was observed in subjects following ivacaftor treatment or placebo PERMANOVA P  0.95 square root ECV  - 4.94 9479 permutations.

We did not observe a discernible change in microbiota com- position in this subgroup and this is likely due to the very small number of subjects relative to the high degree of dissimilarity in the starting microbiota composition.

Conclusions The short-term impact of ivacaftor therapy on sputum microbiota composition in patients with G551D mutations are modest compared to those resulting from antibiotic exposure and may be masked by changes in antibiotic treatment regimen.c 2017 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

To address this we performed a four month placebo controlled crossover study to investigate the impact of ivacaftor therapy on the airway microbiota in adult patients with G551D mutations.

In addition antibiotic treatment regimens which are likely to exert a substantial selective pressure on microbiota composition are variable both within and between patients.

While it remains important to assess the impact of ivacaftor on airway microbiology in the context of routine care the extent of variability in airway microbiota composi- tion between patients and the substantial impact of periodic antibiotic treatment suggests that studies based on very large patient populations are required.

Impact of the CFTR-potentiator ivacaftor on airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis patients carrying a G551D mutation.

Ivacaftor a CFTR-potentiating agent improves sweat chloride weight lung function and pulmonary exacerbation rate in CF patients with G551D mutations but its effect on the airway microbiome remains poorly characterised.Methods Twenty CF patients with at least one G551D mutation from a single centre were recruited to a 4 month double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of ivacaftor with 28 days of active treatment.
