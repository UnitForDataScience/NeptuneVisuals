30.8 p 0.693 and other antibiotics 21.7 vs. 7.7 p 0.633. we compared the antibiotic susceptibility between the relapse and reinfection strains first isolate and observed no dif- ferences between the two groups.because relapse infection is a concern for clinicians we sought to identify the risk factors for relapse cdi by univariate analysis.

in a multivariable logistic regression analysis previous antibiotic exposure was found to be a risk factor for r- cdi or 2.23 95 ci 1.0e4.9 p 14 0.04. patients with relapse had previous antibiotic exposure more frequently than did patients with reinfection p 14 0.03 and patients with reinfection suffered more frequently from chronic liver disease p 14 0.02 than did relapse patients.

antibiotic exposure was associated with relapse cdi 91.3 vs. 61.5 or 0.1 95 ci 0.0e0.9 p 0.03 and chronic liver disease was associated with reinfection 4.3 vs. 30.8 or 9.8 95 ci 1.0e99.9p 0.03. the classes of antibiotics that relapse and reinfection-cdi patients were exposed more frequently were beta-lactams and carbapenems 47.8 vs. 23.1 p 0.175 fluoroquinolones 21.7vs.

despite these limitations we performed an exhaustive analysis of epidemiological clinical and microbiological factors between recurrent and non-recurrent cdi as well as between relapse and reinfection.in conclusion our study detected a moderate rate of recurrence of cdi compared to other studies mainly due to relapse 23 of them.

recurrent cdi r-cdi may be produced by the persistence of spores relapse or by the acquisition of a new strain reinfection.

in this study we analyze epidemiological clinical microbiological and laboratory data from patients with r-cdi relapse and reinfection-cdi over 5 years and compared with a control group non r-cdi.

based on ribotyping 63.9 of the samples were relapse and 36.1 reinfection.

relapse patients compared with the control group had a higher percentage of previous antibiotic exposure although the difference was statistically no significant 73.9 vs. 91.3 p 14 0.06. no significant differences for the selected var- iables were observed between the reinfection and control groups although we observed a higher per- centage of patients with chronic liver disease 30.8 vs 13.3 p 14 0.08. all isolates were sensitive to metronidazole and vancomycin.

nevertheless there were statistically not significant differences between the relapse and reinfection groups.

both frequencies were compared between the first and second episode of cdi for the relapse and reinfection groups but differences were not observed to be statistically significant.

in conclusion our study showed that the recurrence of cdi was associated with antibiotic use and sporulationgermination frequency regardless of relapse or reinfection.

the use of antibiotics would produce a dysbiosis and favor the persistence of the c. difficile spores and relapse.

there is interest in document- ing if r-cdi is due to reinfection or relapse.
