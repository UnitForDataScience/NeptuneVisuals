When comparing microbial communities of HFD-fed gonad-endowed and anorchid mutant mice intermediate levels of microbial variation 35 deregu- lated OTUs were recorded correlating with the atten- uation of the tumorigenic phenotype by castration .Fecal microbial communities from HCC-bearing Trim28hep-- mice displayed significant increases in the Prevotellaceae family which are considered as hallmarks of dysbiosis and frequently altered in patients with cir- rhosis.

Finally lipopolysaccharide LPS systemic levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed no endotoxemia in obese Trim28hep-- mice .HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS IS SUPPRESSED BY AXENIC CONDITIONSDysbiosis can contribute to liver disease and com- pelling evidence links the enteric microbiome with inflammation- and obesity-associated hepatocarcino- genesis.835 Based on this premise we repeated the HFD challenge in mice raised in GF conditions.

In Trim28hep-- mice with HCC taxonomic species previously related to metabolic dysfunction and inflammation such as Prevotella Akkermansia mucini- phila and Bacteroides uniformis343549 were promi- nently deregulated as were some other species not previously associated with any pathologies such as Clostridiaceae SMB53.Demonstrating the critical role of the gut microbiota in the genesis of HCC in our model the pathological phenotype of Trim28hep-- mice was completely abro- gated when they were raised in axenic conditions.

Trim28hep-- mice display sex-specific transcriptional deregulation of a wide range of bile and ste- roid metabolism genes and development of liver adenomas in males.

Trim28hep-- mice exhibit altera- tions of transcriptional dynamics exacerbated by envi- ronmental insults such as obesity and ageing which lead to altered sex hormone signaling perturbations of bile acids metabolism intestinal dysbiosis and a state of metabolic infection that precipitate the development of HCC.Materials and MethodsMOUSE AND NUTRITIONAL CHALLENGEMice were fed with standard mouse chow Kliba Nafag 3242 diet Kilba Nafag Kaiseraugst Switzer- land irradiated 25 kGy 3.85 kcalg and 10 kcal from fat or high-fat diet HFD Open Source Diets Research Diets Inc.

Germ-free GF mice were bred and maintained in flexible film isolators at the Clean Mouse Facility University of Bern Bern Switzerland.

GF mice were routinely monitored by culture-dependent and culture- independent methods and were additionally confirmed to be pathogen free.CHROMATIN IMMUNOPRECIPITATION SEQUENCING ANALYSISTrim28 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ChIP-seq was produced in our lab11 whereas andro- gen receptor AR and Foxa1 ChIP-seq comes from.7 Reads were mapped to the murine genome assembly mm9 using Bowtie212 the exact parameters are bowtie2 -t --sensitive-local -x index -U reads.

Contingency testing was performed using Fisher's exact test.ResultsAGING AND OBESITY LEAD TO MALE-RESTRICTED LIVER CANCER IN Trim28hep-- MICETrim28hep-- animals were generated as reported on a pure C57BL6 background.11 Deep-sequencing- based transcriptome profiling of chow diet CD-fed young animals revealed a dysregulation of 862 and 703 genes in male and female mice respectively   with male-specific over-representation of transcripts encoding for proteins involved in xenobi- otic bile acid BA and steroid metabolism as assessed by Gene Ontology GO and GSEA  .WefirstassessedtheimpactofagingonTrim28hep-- animals by keeping them on a CD for73 weeks Fig.

Still 7 of 9 of these mice all male bore malignant lesions at the outset of the experiment Fig.

1C and .To determine whether the known contribution of obesity to hepatic inflammation may set the stage for HCC development in our model we subjected mice to a 27-week-long metabolic challenge of HFD enriched in medium-chain fatty acids MCFAs derived from hydrogenated coconut oil 58 calories from fat calo- ric density 5.56 Kcalg starting at 8 weeks of age Fig.
