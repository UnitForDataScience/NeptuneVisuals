The establishment of these sulphate-reducing species which correlated with the deple- tion of sulphate Pearson's r  -0.96 p  0.04 is convincing of the potential for subglacially sourced microbes to reduce sulphate within delta sediments consistent with previous studies from subglacial environments   although the incubation bottle effect cannot be excluded.The relative abundance of methane cycling organisms se- quenced was low 0.10 - 0.17 Online Resource 2 contrary to previous studies of subglacial discharge samples  .

Between days 147 and 252 there was a significant decrease in methane to 12.60 x 10-4 - 2.19 x 10-4 mmol two-tailed t test t  4.81 p  0.01 followed by another increase to 23.23 x 10-4 - 3.00 x 10-4 mmol by day 371 two-tailed t test t  4.97 p  0.01 Fig.

Sulphate was found to decrease significantly between days 115 and 251 within the control set-up LRR2  0.93 p  0.01.Bacterial and archaeal cell abundance decreased three- fold during the CO2H2-amended incubations from2.61 x 105 - 0.96 x 105 cells per gram at day 0 to7.67 x 104 - 1.20 x 104 cells per gram at day 371.

The greatest dissimilarities were found between the day 0 communities and the other communities R  0.82 while days 60 147 and 371 communities were found to be moderately similar to each other R  0.44 how- ever due to a low number of samples the results of these analyses were not statistically significant.

In total 17 OTU that were closely related to D. meridiei were found within the day 371 sampled communities accounting for 4.00 x 104 - 0.31 x 104 cells per gram or 52 of the population.

Within CO2H2-amended incubations sulphate depletion and a shift in the microbial community to a 52 predominance of Desulfosporosinus meridiei by day 371 provides evidence for sulphate reduction.

Later a reduction in methane was observed to be paired with the depletion of sulphate and we hypothesise that sulphate reduction out competed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.
