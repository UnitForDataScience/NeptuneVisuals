b. we calculate that between days 147 and 252 methane oxidation occurred at rates of 4.22 pmol g-1 d-1 and sulphate reduction oc- curred at rates 1000-fold greater at 3.54 nmol g-1 d-1 as- suming that sulphate was not depleted before day 252. within control incubations methane increased minimally between days 60 and 251 2.2 x 10-4 mmol increase linear regression r2 coefficient lrr2  0.83 p  0.01. methaneabundance measurements from control and co2h2- amended incubations were statistically different on days 60 251252 and 371 two-tailed t test t  3.64 p  0.01. there was no significant difference between methane mea- sured on day 0 under the two incubation conditions two- tailed t test t  0.87 p  0.48. sulphate was found to decrease significantly between days 115 and 251 within the control set-up lrr2  0.93 p  0.01.bacterial and archaeal cell abundance decreased three- fold during the co2h2-amended incubations from2.61 x 105 - 0.96 x 105 cells per gram at day 0 to7.67 x 104 - 1.20 x 104 cells per gram at day 371. catchall-calculated alpha diversity of 16s rrna gene amplicons was notably and significantly reduced during the co2h2-amended experiment from 1307 - 65 at the start of the experiment to 268 - 77 a t the end lrr2  0.78 p  0.01. no significant change in diversity was observed within the control incubations lrr2  0.27 p  0.09. the co2h2-amended communities were found to be highly dissimilar to the control incubation communi- ties when a two-way analysis of similarity anosim was performed accounting for differences in sampling time r  0.83 p  0.01. due to the reduction in cell abundance and diversity and their anosim-calculated uniqueness we focus on the co2h2-amended communities herein.co2h2-amended communities sampled at different time points were found to be dissimilar globalr  0.71 p  0.01. the greatest dissimilarities were found between the day 0 communities and the other communities r  0.82 while days 60 147 and 371 communities were found to be moderately similar to each other r  0.44 how- ever due to a low number of samples the results of these analyses were not statistically significant.

the establishment of these sulphate-reducing species which correlated with the deple- tion of sulphate pearson's r  -0.96 p  0.04 is convincing of the potential for subglacially sourced microbes to reduce sulphate within delta sediments consistent with previous studies from subglacial environments   although the incubation bottle effect cannot be excluded.the relative abundance of methane cycling organisms se- quenced was low 0.10 - 0.17 online resource 2 contrary to previous studies of subglacial discharge samples  .

in total 17 otu that were closely related to d. meridiei were found within the day 371 sampled communities accounting for 4.00 x 104 - 0.31 x 104 cells per gram or 52 of the population.

within co2h2-amended incubations sulphate depletion and a shift in the microbial community to a 52 predominance of desulfosporosinus meridiei by day 371 provides evidence for sulphate reduction.

later a reduction in methane was observed to be paired with the depletion of sulphate and we hypothesise that sulphate reduction out competed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.

these results highlight the need for further investigations into the fate of subglacial microbiota within downstream environments.keywords subglacial environment .

under the assump- tion that cells are deposited alongside glacial sediments in the river delta at the fjord head which likely amass at rates of 9- 16 mm yr-1  and assuming that once buried under subsequent depositions the environment becomes waterlogged and anoxic this study sought to consider the potential activity of transported subglacial communities especially methanogens whose poten- tial activity and greenhouse gas production has been reported previously -.

methanogen-related amplicons that were closely related to methanomicrobiales two otu and methanosarcinales five otu including three otu that were most closely related to anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme organisms known also to be involved in sulphate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane aom  were identified in the day 0 and day 60 communities which were consistent with previous studies of subglacial environments     online resource 2. aerobic methylotrophs belonging to methylobacteriaceae four otu and methylocystaceae one otu were additionally identified online resource 2. no methane cycling-related amplicons were detected within the final day 371 incubation.the results of our methane cycling analysis are inconclu- sive however they inspire several hypotheses that warrant further investigation.

sulphate reduction .

we measured changes in methane and sulphate concentrations and assessed the temporal variability of bacterial and archaeal abundance and community structure in order to gain insight into anaerobic microbial activ- ity.

a. the decrease between days 147 and 252 was coincident with a significant depletion in sulphate from 1.49 - 1.29 mmol to 0 - 0 mmol two-tailed t test t  25.99 p  0.01 fig.
