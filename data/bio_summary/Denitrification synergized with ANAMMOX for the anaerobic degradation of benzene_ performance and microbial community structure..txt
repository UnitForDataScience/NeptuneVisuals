The previous results showed that additions of NO - more than 5 mg N L-1 inhibited benzene degradation in the denitrification- ANAMMOX synergistic system once NO - was depletedthe rate of benzene degradation recovered in the synergistic22of benzene degradation decreased to 2.61 - 0.06 mg gsystem.

Furthermore the mechanism of denitrification synergized with ANAMMOX for benzene degradation needs to be elucidated.A sequencing batch reactor SBR of denitrification synergized with ANAMMOX for benzene degradation was established by inoculating ANAMMOX sludge into an SBR of denitrification for improving the performance of anaerobic benzene degradation in this study.

This finding indicated that there was almost no activity of ANAMMOX in SBR-Den during the stable operation which is in agreement with the result that the externally added NH  was not con- sumed along with benzene degradation during the long- running operation of the reactor.Benzene degradation in the denitrification-ANAMMOX synergistic reactorThe rate of benzene degradation in SBR-DenAna gradu- ally increased after the inoculation of AnAOB and the operation of the reactor was divided into three phases Fig.

The average rate of benzene degradation and the maximum first-order kinetic constant in SBR-DenAna were 2.34- and 1.41-fold those in SBR-Den respectively indicating that ANAMMOX improved the degradation of benzene under de- nitrification synergized with ANAMMOX.

The averaged results are reported here.The first-order degradation constantsThe first-order degradation constants were calculated accord- ing to Eq.

Therefore anaerobic ben- zene degradation under denitrification is promising.Anaerobic benzene degradation dependent on nitrate as electron acceptor was first demonstrated by Major and col- leagues in 1988.

Therefore nitrite often accumulated in this process leading to intermittent inhibition of benzene degradation and thus reducing the rate of benzene degradation Gitiafroz .

In phase III 281-289 days the degradation of benzene ceased without adding NO - as electron acceptor however the pro- cess was immediately restored after the addition of NO3- indicating that benzene degradation depended on nitrate re- duction.

.Effect of nitrite on anaerobic benzene degradation in denitrification synergized with ANAMMOXThe effects of NO - on the rate of benzene degradation in the denitrification-ANAMMOX synergistic system are presented in Fig.
