In contrast to germfree controls mice monocolonized with the L. murinus isolate exhibited significantly higher fecal ILA IAA and IAld which indicates that L. murinus is capable of producing these indoles and .5 8 6  n A T U r e  v o L 5 5 1  3 0 n o v e m b e r 2 0 1 7 a800600400b15001000c105104 TH17 conditions Vehicle  ILA 200 uM 1284a160140NSDHSDHSD  L. murinus b130120Systolic Diastolic95 90852000NSD HSD5000HSDHSD 1030-1030 T 17 conditions120100110801007570L.

To corroborate the modulatory effects of L. murinus we used segmented filamentous bacteria SFB as known inducers of intestinal TH17 cellsand compared MOG35-55 immunization in gnotobiotic mice that had either only SFB germfree with SFB or SFB and L. murinus germfree with SFB and L. murinus.
