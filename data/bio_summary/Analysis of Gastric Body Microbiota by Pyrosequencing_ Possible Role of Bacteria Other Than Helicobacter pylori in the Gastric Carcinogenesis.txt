On the contrary to the usual concept HP is neutralophiles.15 That it in the case of subjects with high acid-secretion HP escapes from body and settles in the antrum leading to antrum-predominant gastritis.16 However when HP succeeds in the colonization it begins to dominant in the stomach resulting in decrease of microbiota diversity.

Additionally the grades of neutrophils and monocytes infiltration were significantly different between HP  cancer group and the others antrum P  0.046 P  0.184 body P  0.013 P  0.162 respectively.Gastric antrum versus body mucosaThe means of reads and OTUs were lower in gastric antral mucosa samples than gastric body mucosa samples Fig.

HP Helicobacter pylori NB nitrosating or nitrate-reducing bacteria UB urease-producing bacteria con control P  0.05 compared to HP- control P  0.05 compared to HP- cancer.The proportion of non-HP-UB and non-HP-NB was higher in the HP- cancer group than in that of the HP cancer group especially body mucosa antrum P  0.053 P  0.121 body P  0.053 P  0.051 respectively Fig.

Analysis of overlap of non-HP UB and non-HP NB revealed the higher composition of Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae S. parasanguinis and S. oralis in HP- cancer groups than the others only in the body P  0.030 but not in the antrum P  0.123.Conclusions Higher diversity and higher composition of S. pseudopneumoniae S. parasanguinis and S. oralis in HP- cancer group than the other groups in the body suggest that analysis of microbiota from body mucosa could be beneficial to identify a role of non-HP bacteria in the gastric carcinogenesis.J Cancer Prev 201722115-125Key Words Microbiota Helicobacter pylori Antrum mucosa Body mucosaINTRODUCTIONHuman is constantly exposed to pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and fungi.

However Helicobacter pylori HP was found to be colonized in the gastric epitheliumof more than half of the world's human population.1 HP generateslarge quantities of urease an enzyme capable of transiently buffering the acidic environment by the break-down of urea to generate ammonia and carbon dioxide.2 These two products could serve as substrates for other microbes and change the gastric microbiome.3 Additionally HP urease is a major inducer of innate immune response in monocytes macrophages and neutrophils.

In order to distinguish if the infection is an existing one the following two methods were used Serum HP immunoglobulin G Genedia HP ELISA Green Cross Medical Science Co. Eumseong Korea and a history of HP infection eradication treatment.

Bacterial infection has been linked to cancer through two mechanisms 1 chronic inflammation and 2 production of carcinogenic metabolites such as HP infection.23Gastric acidity is a barrier to bacterial overgrowth.2425 The bacterial colonization in stomach increases under the condition such as acid-reducing drug atrophic gastritis and gastric surgery.1025 In addition decreased gastric acid secretion is responsible for an increased risk of infection.20 The antrum and body of stomach are distinct niches for microbial colonization owing to differential ability to secrete gastric acid.26 Thus comparison of gastric microbiota between gastric antrum and body will be useful.

The aim of our study is to investigate the difference of human gastric microbiota between antrum and body according to disease control vs. gastric cancer and HP status.

Our previous studies revealed that gastric microbiota were different according to HP infection status and presence or absence of gastric cancer in gastric mucosa by using a pyrosequencing method.11-13 We also conducted a research which suggested that gastric mucosa could be more effective than gastric fluid in the detection of meaningful gastric microbiome.11On the other hand gastric antrum and body are different in terms of acid secretion.
