In this sense almost all the samples assessed were digested by 80-90 except of peanuts which are hardly digested-fermented.Antioxidant capacityAntioxidant capacity obtained with the GAR methodGAR  measures the global antioxidant capacity of three differ- ent food fractions the supernatant obtained after digestion poten- tially bioaccessible the supernatant obtained after fermentation potentially bioaccessible and the solid residue remaining after fermentation antioxidant activity lost with Global antioxidant capacity of each food would be the sum of these three values.

This difference could be related to the large amount ofTable 3Antioxidant capacity of foods lmol Trolox per g of fresh sample obtained with four different extraction methods.ABTSFRAP  Data not available.a Data obtained from .b Data obtained from .c Data obtained from .d Data obtained from .compounds that are released by the gut microbiota during fermen- tation which is a step not included in the GAR method.

This CV represents the variability of fermenting food several times the same day using inoculum from the same person.Intraday and interindividual variability we performed a CV among the antioxidant capacity values obtained with each inoculum and thereafter a mean of these CVs was calculated expressing variability among individuals.Interday and intraindividual variability we performed a mean of the CVs obtained each day during five days for each inoculumindividual obtaining a CV that says the variation of using faecal material from the same person during several days.-Interday and interindividual variability a CV of the antioxi- dant capacity values obtained with each inoculum along the five days was performed obtaining a CV that indicates the variability of using faecal material from different people in different days.Effect of freezing storage of faecal samples The effect of freezing and storing on microbial activity during fermentation was also assessed.

After that antioxidant capacity was measured by the FRAP method.Antioxidant capacityThe antioxidant capacity of three fractions was assessed the supernatant obtained after gastrointestinal digestion the super- natant derived from fermentation and the solid residue remaining after fermentation.

In all three cases the antioxidant capacity was assessed by ABTS and FRAP.The results obtained with GAR for the TEACABTS method were very similar to those obtained by GAR .

How- ever in the cases of chicken and peanuts the antioxidant capacity obtained with GAR was 2-3 times higher than that obtained by the GAR method.

Thus the GAR method pro- vides reliable values of the antioxidant capacity of foods that are closer to their in vivo activity by includ- ing the effects of gut microbiota over non-digested nutrients.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionAntioxidant capacity has drawn a great deal of research atten- tion due to the vital importance of protecting biological tissues from oxidation which has a negative impact on human health through chronic disorders such as cancer cardiovascular diseases neurological diseases and aging .

Antioxidant capacity of each assay was measured through FRAP method.Intraday variability seven different foods were fermented seven times with four different inoculum three from healthy donors and the fourth consisting of a mix of equal weight of the three individual different faeces and the antioxidant capacity was measured by the FRAP method.

The calibration curve was performed with Tro- lox ranging from 1.00 mgmL to 0.01 mgmL and the resultsobtained are expressed as lmol Trolox equivalents per mL ofsample.GEACRED reducing capacity method This method was developed to analyse the global reducing capacity of the samples using car- min indigo as the redox indicator.
