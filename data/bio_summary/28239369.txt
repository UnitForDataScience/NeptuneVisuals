Due to its association with an extensive deposit of iron ore and since it is one of the least studied ecosystems in Brazil IQ has a seriously threatened biodiversity due to the intense mining activity associated with its iron outcrops.Among the plant species threatened by this anthropic activity in IQ there have been few studies particularly on holoparasitic plants as in the case of Langsdorffia hypogaea MART the model of this study being Asteraceae Guatteria genus Fabaceae Dalbergia genus Melastomataceae Miconia genus and Myrsinaceae Myrsine genus the most representative families of potential host plants from L. hypogaea  .

The potential of some of these isolates is indicated in  ranging from 28 in isolates from L. hypogaea to above 95 in the isolates R50 R51 R52 H55 and H58 from rizhosphere and host respectively.DISCUSSIONIdentification of Microbiota Associated with L. hypogaea and Its InteractionsThe importance and complexity of the rhizosphere in the interaction with plants and other organisms in which they live have been reported in many studies      .

This allows us to infer that there may be a direct association of soil bacteria with the holoparasitic plant and that a possible relation of complementarity makes the parasitic plant not only dependent on the plant host for survival but also dependent on specific soil bacteria.

The communication between the plant roots and organisms present in the rhizosphere is based on the production and secretion of chemicals that can cause different responses depending on the sensitivity or responsiveness of microorganisms present in this highly dynamic environment      .Some microorganisms present in this plant rhizosphere- interface have the ability to solubilize mineral phosphates among other soil nutrients  .

Although need the host plant for aquisition of carbohydrates since it does not have the capacity of producing them itself by the chlorophyll absence L. hypogaea could also depend closely on PGPB to assist in the development of its roots aquisition of ions from the rhizosphere or even in the interaction with its host plant through their haustoria.

The results demonstrate for the first time the biological importance of Brazilian IQ species as reservoirs of specific microbiotas that might be used as PGPB on agricultural land or antropized soils that needs to be reforested.Keywords Langsdorffia hypongaea bioprospecting biotechnological potential plant growth-promoting bacteria Brazilian Iron Quadrangle IAA and siderophoresINTRODUCTIONThroughout evolution plants have developed adaptive mechanisms related to interactions with microorganisms   .

The geomorphological peculiarities of IQ soil rich in iron ore as well as the model of interaction between L. hypogaea its hosts and the soil provide a unique niche that acts as selective pressure to the evolution of plant growth-promoting bacteria PGPB.

The isolates from L. hypogaea L3 L16 L22 and L8 the isolates from the plant host H55 H60 H64 H67 H71 H75 H76 and H80 and the isolates from the rhizosphere R38 and R51 were grouped in a different clade .For the biochemical tests 66 isolates were analyzed since nine of these isolates showed reduced growth rate prevented an accurate analysis of the results in the proposed biochemical assays.

This microbial community is essential for the development of plants since it facilitates the absortion of nutrients and at the same time provides protection against phytopathogens Fungi oomycetes bacteria viroses protozoa and nematodes and herbivores  .The rhizosphere or portion of soil that has close contact with the plant roots represents a highly dynamic environment that enables the interaction of roots with beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms invertebrates and even root systems of other plants    .
