Such strate- gies have already identified patients with eosinophilic or type 2-driven inflammation as more likely to respond to corticosteroids or recently approved biologics and have prompted research on phenotypes unresponsive to such treatments such as those with noneosinophilic inflammation or eosinophilic inflammation that persists despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

Compared with patients with eosinophilic inflammation who actually comprised the greatest proportion 50 of subjects in the study those with neutrophilic inflammation harbored a less diverse bacterial community.

This highlights the heterogeneity of the airway microbiome at least compositionally even within this severe asthma subgroup as is evident from Fig 2 of the study.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 141 NUMBER 1DURACK BOUSHEY AND HUANG 83An important strength of the study is the relatively large number of patients with severe asthma studied representing one of the largest investigations to date that corroborates previous findings of airway bacterial microbiota associations with diminished or absent eosinophilic inflammation in asthmatic patients.

For example it is clear that current therapies directed largely at ameliorating bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids do not work for all patients.

A promising approach to this clinical dilemma lies in stratifying patients by markers of underlying airway inflammation in particular neutrophilic and eosinophilic phenotypes.

Moreover immune responses related to neutrophilic inflammation eg TH17-associated epithelial gene expression have been associated with Gammaproteobacteria abundance.These biological features might explain the ineffectiveness of corticosteroids in certain subsets of patients with steroid- refractory asthma among whom it has been shown that the presence of Haemophilus but not Prevotella species can attenuate the macrophage response to dexamethasone.However just as intriguing is the finding by Taylor et al of essentially no relationship between airway bacterial community composition and sputum eosinophil percentages.

Longitudinal studies will be necessary to understand the dynamics of the airway microbiome in asthmatic patients and the extent to which changes are accompanied by shifts in patterns of airway inflammation.

Although many mechanisms underlying eosinophilic asthma have been delineated the mechanisms driving neutrophilic or persistent eosinophilic inflammation remain poorly understood.Severe asthma itself is heterogeneous based on differences in clinical demographic and inflammatory features.

Thus one might have expected associations to have been found between eosinophilic inflammation and the profiled sputum bacterial community.

Moreover paucigranulocytic inflammation was the second most common phenotype 36 observed and the absence of relation- ships to the bacterial microbiome implies that other mechanisms are involved in this subgroup.
