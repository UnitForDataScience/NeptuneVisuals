If we are able to identify and synthesize these signal molecules this will significantly advance our ability to harness this approach for restoration of degraded drylands because this will not only improve colonization and survival of bio- crust communities but will also foster nutrient cycling and make conditions more suitable for the establishment and development of vascular plants.While numerous scientific social and political chal- lenges still need to be overcome before approaches based on microbial biotechnology and synthetic biology can be implemented under natural conditions they hold an enormous potential to improve the restoration of degraded dry lands.

While there have been successful restoration experiences using these biocrust constituents in dry lands from the USA Israel and China the use of biocrusts in dryland restoration is far from being wide- spread Weber et al.

This number will substantially increase in the coming decades given the forecasted increases in aridity due to climate change and to the high population growth of most developing countries.Here we focus on the contributions of microbial biotechnology to improve the restoration of degraded drylands and to combat desertification which are an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goal SDG 15 of the 2030 Agenda which aims to 'protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests combat deser- tification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.'

Hence researchers are now exploring restoration actions usingnotable promise to improve restoration actions based on the use of biocrust-forming cyanobacteria.

1E pushing the community far from dangerous tipping points leading to degraded ecosystem states.Other advances in microbial biotechnology could also be used to enhance the outcome of dryland restoration activities and thus the achievement of SDG 15.

Biocrust-forming cyanobacteria can be engineered to foster the restoration of degraded drylands and thus the achievement of SDG 15 through the establishment of cooperative interactions E.The basis of this approach is the design or modification of ecological interactions by engineering a mutualistic relation between vascular plantsH and engineered cyanobacteria SYN.

The failure of restoration actions can enhance erosion rates and further reduce plant cover processes that can trigger accelerated changes leading to ecosystem collapse Reynolds et al.

Once a given external parameter such as increasing aridity andor grazing pressure is slowly increased an irreversible transition from a vegetated and functional to a degraded desertified ecosystem can occur Reynolds et al.

Current restoration efforts using bio- crusts have focused on the growth in the laboratory greenhouse and subsequent inoculation in the field of biocrust constituents such as mosses and cyanobacteria Weber et al.
