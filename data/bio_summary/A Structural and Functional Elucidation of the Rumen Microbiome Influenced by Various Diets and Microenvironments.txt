Glycoside hydrolases  GH 91 proteins glycosyltransferases  GT 38 proteins carbohydrate esterases  CE 16 proteins carbohydrate-binding modules  CBM 2 proteins and S-layer homology domains  SLH 19 proteins A. Pie charts depict the phylogenetic origin of CAZymes of the respective categories in diets and sample fractions at phyla level blue Bacteroidetes green Firmicutes red Proteobacteria yellow environmental samples gray others B. RF rumen fluid LP liquid phase SP solid phase.CBM32 family was most abundant in the SP fraction of the grass silage-based diet Figure 4A.

However the abundance of Elusimicrobia proteins was lower when compared to the respective OTUs whereas the abundance of Verrucomicrobia proteins was higher when compared to the corresponding OTUs Table S2.

Furthermore the increased abundance levels of the Succinivibrionaceae family Figure 2 the higher amount of succinate Table 3 and the increased abundance of six propionate-producing Phascolarctobacterium proteins in the fractions of the corn silage-based diet may indicate a consistency with the above-mentioned investigations.No OTUs were assigned to the Firmicutes order of Bacillales or the family of Selenomonadaceae with its typical members of the rumen ecosystem Selenomonas ruminantium and Anaerovibrio lipolytica.

The present data may confirm a high metabolic activity of the Verrucomicrobia phylum due to the higher abundance of proteins when compared to the respective OTUs.The Prevotellaceae family comprises common rumen bacteria such as Prevotella ruminicola P. brevis P. bryantii and P. albensis and was shown to increase in abundance upon inclusion of concentrate in diets Henderson et al.

Thus the lower abundance of the Selenomonadaceae family in the grass silage-based diet might be linked to a similarly decreased abundance of the Butyrivibrio proteins in the respective samples.The family of Erysipelotrichaceae of the Clostridium subphylum cluster XVII as well belonging to the phylum of Firmicutes exhibited the highest abundance of LFQs and particularly OTUs in the sample fractions of the hay- based diet Figure 2.

Proteins involved in the citric acid cycle showed a remarkably low abundance in the SP fractions of the grass silage- and hay-based diets Figure 6C pointing toward a low abundance of substrates like succinate which is in accordance with the abundance values of proteins of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway.

Details about the proteins assigned to the different CAZy-categories including the phylogenetic origin and the respective functions are listed in Table S3.ABC TransportersWebMGA assigned 7745 and 336 KO identifiers to 8163 bacterial and 358 archaeal proteins respectively Table S4 revealing a total of 170 bacterial proteins with sequencesimilarity to ABC transporters Table S5 as defined by the KO database.

Contrarily theLFQ-values of proteins of the Selenomonadaceae family assessed in the present study revealed a lower abundance throughout the grass silage-based diet when compared to the corn silage- and the hay-based samples Figure 2 including proteins involved in propionate formation Table S7 and with sequence similarity to SLH Table S3.

The metaproteomic approach identified the alpha beta and gamma subunits of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase based on 15 proteins Table S7 that constituted 23 of the total abundance of 55 proteins that belonged to the methane metabolism as defined by the KEGG database.
