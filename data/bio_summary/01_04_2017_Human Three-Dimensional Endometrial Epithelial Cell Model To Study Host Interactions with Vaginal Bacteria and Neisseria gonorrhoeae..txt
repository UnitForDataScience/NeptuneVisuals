Overall these data illustrate that selected bacterial species that reside in the lower FRT can adhere to cells in the human 3-D EEC model suggesting that our 3-D model could be used to study host-microbe interactions and potentially the steps in biofilm formation.Cells in the human 3-D endometrial epithelial cell model produce proinflam- matory cytokines and chemokines following infection with pathogenic gonococci but not following infection with vaginal bacterial species.

Nevertheless these data demonstrate that MAMs are expressed in the human endometrial cells in the 3-D cell culture.Cells in the human 3-D endometrial epithelial cell model produce proinflam- matory cytokines and chemokines following exposure to microbial products.

To summarize we have shown that polyIC a viral product and flagellin a bacterial product but not FSL-1 or LPS are able to significantly induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the 3-D human EEC model in a dose-dependent manner.Vaginal bacterial species and N. gonorrhoeae colonize cells in the human 3-D endometrial epithelial cell model.

Importantly this TLR expression profile was consistent with the TLR expression profile in primary endometrial tissue  and in primary human endometrial epithelial cells  reported by others.To study the functionality of TLRs in our model we treated 3-D EEC aggregates with selected microbial products for 24 h after which expression of proinflammatorycytokine and chemokine mRNAs was quantified by qRT-PCR.

These features recapitulate the morphological characteristics of the tissue in vivo suggesting that the 3-D culture system allows a high degree of cell differentiation toward an endometrial cell phenotype.Cells in the human 3-D endometrial epithelial cell model express membrane- associated mucins.

Two other immortalized normal epithelial cell lines human endometrial surface epithelial cells HES and human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized EECs were recently shown to be HeLa cervical carcinoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells respectively .

In contrast to our results with polyIC and flagellin exposure of human endometrial cells in the 3-D cell culture to FSL-1 a synthetic bacterial lipoprotein or LPS did not result in any detectable increase in the level of expression of any of the proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines tested .To confirm these results we also assayed cell supernatants using multiplex cyto- metric bead arrays to quantify the levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

To construct the human 3-D endometrial epithelial cell EEC model we used the rotating wall vessel RWV bioreactor technology  and the previously established endometrial epithelial cell line HEC-1A.

Our results from HEC-1A cells grown in 3-D cell culture are in agreement with those of all three studies of biopsy specimens or primary endometrial epithelium demonstrating expression of all tested TLRs TLR1 to TLR9  with the level of expression of TLR7 being the lowest .Beyond monitoring their expression we also determined the ability of the TLRs expressed in our 3-D EEC aggregates to respond to their cognate agonists.

The lack of TLR4 signaling in our model is not surprising as it has been shown that HEC-1A cells do not respond to LPS  and we have previously shown that epithelial cells lining the lower FRT generally do not respond to LPS   .We also examined the expression of mucins given that the mucus layer that coats the human FRT plays a crucial role in host defense against microbial pathogens.
