This sample was placed in the Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectrophotometer Shimadzu IR spectrophotometer 8400S Japan and the spectra were measured against reference LDPE and HDPE strips which were not exposed to bacterial consortia to obtain a spectrum of percentage of transmittance versus wave number.Scanning electron microscopy analysisThe LDPE and HDPE test strips the polymers exposed to bacterial consortia for 120 days were inspected by high- resolution scanning electron microscope Model Geminr specifications w-filament low vacuum and humidity ca- pability secondary E-T and solid-state back-scattered electron detector ultrathin window energy-dispersive spectroscopy EDS system EDAX and resolution at 20 kV3 nm in high vacuum to inspect the modifications in the surface of the plastic films.

DOI 10.1007s11356-017-8537-0Enhanced biodegradation of low and high-density polyethylene by novel bacterial consortia formulatedfrom plastic-contaminated cow dung under thermophilic conditionsSinosh Skariyachan12  Anagha Shamsundar Setlur12  Sujay Yashwant Naik12 Ashwini Amaresh Naik12  Makam Usharani 12  Kiran S Vasist12Received 9 September 2016  Accepted 31 January 2017  Published online 10 February 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017Abstract The current study aimed to devise eco-friendly safe and cost-effective strategies for enhanced degradation of low- and high-density polyethylene LDPE and HDPE using newly formu- lated thermophilic microbial consortia from cow dung and to assess the biodegradation end products.

Therefore the current study focuses on the biodegradation of two forms of plastics LDPE and HDPE by means of novel thermophilic bacteria isolated from cow dung gathered from plastic-contaminated environments and formulating novel consortia constituting different thermophiles for obtaining an effective degradation of plastic.

The NMR spectra were recorded and the peaks attained for the test samples were compared with the control to gauge the formation of end products during plastic degradation.Molecular characterization of the best isolates by 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequencingThe four bacterial isolates IS1-IS4 that demonstrated the best degradation of LDPE and HDPE strips and pellets when com- bined in consortia were sequenced by 16S ribosomal DNA rDNA gene sequencing.

This study identified 75 - 2 55 - 2 60 - 3 and 43 - 3 degradation for LDPE strips pellets HDPE strips and pellets re- spectively for a period of 120 days p  0.05 at 55 degC by the formulated consortia of IS1-IS4 and the degradation efficiency was found to be better in comparison with other formulations.

and catalase Taylor and Achanzar  tests.Study of growth parametersThe isolates which demonstrated maximum LDPE and HDPE degradation were selected and plastic degradation studies were performed under varying temperature and pH condi- tions.

.Formulating a microbial consortia for LDPE and HDPE degradationThe isolates that produced a zone of clearance after the appli- cation of coomassie brilliant blue were selected to form bac- terial consortia.

Likewise the HDPE strips degraded by 60.0 - 3 while the pellets by 43.0 - 3 by the microbial consortia that contained all the four isolates IS1-IS4 in com- parison with other formulated consortia using various combi- nations Table .

d IR spectrum of HDPE test sample with incubation with consortia which showed presence of additional peaks at 1500 cm-1 and between 2000 and 2500 cm-1observed in HDPE was relatively higher than LDPE.
