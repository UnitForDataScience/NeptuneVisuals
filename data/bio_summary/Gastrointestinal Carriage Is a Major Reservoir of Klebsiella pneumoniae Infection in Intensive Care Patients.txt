this suggests that although measures to reduce cross-contamination between patients are necessary they are not sufficient to eliminate k. pneumoniae infections in hospitalized patients and measures to minimize the risk of infection with the patients' own microbiome deserves significant attention 21-23.klebsiella pneumoniae infections in icu  cid 201765 15 july  213key strengths of this study are the prospective cohort design and the use of wgs to confirm species identification and strain relatedness for all k. pneumoniae isolated from icu patients regardless of antimicrobial susceptibility.
