Of all ICU patients who developed K. pneumoniae infections and contributed baseline screening swabs 48 n  1327 tested positive for K. pneu- moniae GI carriage at baseline including 8 who were screened2 days prior to developing the infection.To determine whether infections were caused by patients' own colonizing bacteria and to identify transmission between ICU patients we sequenced the genomes of all K. pneumo- niae isolated from patients who had spent any time in the ICU during their hospital stays.

This suggests that although measures to reduce cross-contamination between patients are necessary they are not sufficient to eliminate K. pneumoniae infections in hospitalized patients and measures to minimize the risk of infection with the patients' own microbiome deserves significant attention 21-23.Klebsiella pneumoniae Infections in ICU  CID 201765 15 July  213Key strengths of this study are the prospective cohort design and the use of WGS to confirm species identification and strain relatedness for all K. pneumoniae isolated from ICU patients regardless of antimicrobial susceptibility.

For 57 patients the resistance profiles for the follow-up isolate remained the same as the baseline isolate and for 27 patients the follow-up isolate was more resistant see Supplementary Tables 1 and 3.GI Colonization Is a Source of Klebsiella InfectionA total of 49 patients 1.8 of all adult ICU admissions who spent time in the ICU during their hospital stay were identified as having K. pneumoniae infections 11 ESBL of which 3 were also CP.

In sum 49 of K. pneumoniae infections were caused by the patients' own unique strain and 48 of screened patients with infections were positive for prior colonization.Conclusions.

pneumoniae infection among ICU patients and the relative contribution of patients' own gut microbiota and intra-hospital transmission to the burden of K. pneumoniae carriage and infection in the ICU.METHODSEthicsEthical approvals for these studies were granted by the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee project numbers 55012 and 52613.Recruitment and Specimen and Data CollectionThe Klebsiella Acquisition Surveillance Project at Alfred Health KASPAH was conducted from April 1 2013 to March 31 2014.

GI carriage of MDR strains was detected at similar rates among HA baseline isolates 18 including 4 ESBL and 2 CP isolates all in patients who had received antibiotics in the last 7 days and follow-up screening isolates 16 of patients including 4 with ESBL and 1 with CP isolates.

Fifteen patients had both GI carriage and infection isolates available for genome comparison 12 of these pairs matched at the lineage level including 6 patients whose car- riage isolate was collected 2 days prior to the infection.Klebsiella Transmission in the ICUSixteen Klebsiella lineages were detected in more than 1 patient dark shading Figure 2.

Using 25 and 10 SNPs per 5 Mbp as cut-offs to indicate likely and very likely strain sharing between patients we identified 5 groups of ICU patients that likely shared Klebsiella strains.

HA carriage among ICU patients was estimated to be much higher at 19 with 12 of patients converting from culture-negative at base- line to culture-positive on follow-up.
