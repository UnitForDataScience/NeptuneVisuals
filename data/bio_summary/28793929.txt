The additional experiment conducted during May 2014 showed similar results re- garding Sulfurimonas- and Sulfurovum-like OTUs when exposed to oxygen or maintained anoxic Additional file Figure S3.Extracted 16S rRNA gene sequences from the metage- nomic dataset at the end of the incubation showed aOxic control day 0 Oxic control day 20 Oxic to anoxic day 0 Oxic to anoxic day 20 Anoxic control day 0 Anoxic control day 20 Anoxic to oxic day 0 Anoxic to oxic day 20Oxic field Oxic control day 21 Oxic to anoxic day 21Anoxic field Anoxic control day 21 Anoxic to oxic day 21Intermediate field Intermediate to anoxic day 21Intermediate to oxic day 21Oxic control day 21 Oxic to anoxic day 21 Anoxic control day 21 Anoxic to oxic day 21Intermediate to anoxic day 21Intermediate to oxic day 21020406080100Archaea Acidithiobacilla Acidobacteria Actinobacteria Aquificae Armatimonadetes Bacteroidetes Candidate divisions Chlamydiae ChlorobiChloroflexi Chrysiogenetes Cyanobacteria Deferribacteres Deinococcus-Thermus Dictyoglomi Elusimicrobia Fibrobacteres Firmicutes FusobacteriaGemmatimonadetes Lentisphaerae Nitrospirae Planctomycetes Alphaproteobacteria Betaproteobacteria DeltaproteobacteriaEpsilonproteobacteriaSulfurimonas EpsilonproteobacteriaSulfurovum EpsilonproteobacteriaOtherGammaproteobacteria ProteobacteriaOther Spirochaetes Synergistetes Tenericutes Thaumarchaeota Thermotogae Verrucomicrobia Unclassified OTUs Unclassified bacteriaFig.

In the sediment cores from the anoxic site the relative abun- dance of Sulfurimonas-like OTUs increased from 4.5 in the anoxic field sample to 18.4 in the anoxic control and 13.8 in the anoxic-to-oxic cores Fig.

Chemical 16S rRNA gene metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate changes in chemistry fluxes microbial communitystructure and metabolic functions in the sediment surface.Results Compared to anoxic controls oxygenation of anoxic sediment resulted in a proliferation of bacterialpopulations in the facultative anaerobic genus Sulfurovum that are capable of oxidizing toxic sulfide.

To verify the mi- crobial community composition responses to oxygenation complementary samples for 16S rRNA gene operational taxonomic unit OTU analysis were collected during an experiment in May 2014 by sampling sediment cores from the anoxic field site out of which five cores were main- tained anoxic and five cores were turned oxic full details of sampling and incubation procedure in .penetration depth in the sediment surface was not measured in this experiment but was confirmed to be 1.5 mm in an additional experiment conducted in April 2016 15 days of incubation with a similar setup at 8 degC in darkness determined with the optical oxy- gen meter attached to the motorized micromanipulator.Sub-samples taken for analysis were 1 4.5 mL sedi- ment mixed with 0.5 mL 5 water-saturated phenol in absolute ethanol flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and later used to extract RNA 2 10 mL sediment was stored on ice and used for DNA extraction 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics 3 5 mL sediment used for total pore-water iron 4 1 mL sediment transferred intoa pre-weighed 2 mL polypropylene tube used to estimate sediment organic matter  wt and 5 the remainingsediment was retained for measurement of SO 2- PO 3-concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 and a Qubit 2.0.The 16S rRNA Illumina library was prepared using44NO-  NO- reduced sulfur compounds pH and redoxPCR primers 341f and 805r and a modified PCR23potential.

The thiosulfate concentration was zero in all samples except in the sediment pore-water from the anoxic cores sliced in the field that had 48 - 15 mm n  2 Additional file Table S2.The organic matter content in the oxic field sample was 11.7 - 1.0 n  3 which was lower than the anoxic 18.4 - 0.5 n  3 and intermediate 18.5 - 0.6 n  2 field sediments Table The oxic and intermediate organic matter content remained stable over the experi- ment while the anoxic-to-oxic organic matter significantly decreased to 15 - 1.4 one-way ANOVA F  28.41 p  0.01 n  3.

Alpha diversity cal- culations on all OTUs using Shannon's H index showed a significantly higher diversity in the oxic samples 9.56 - 0.11 n  7 compared to intermediate8.97 - 0.28 n  8 and anoxic 8.75 - 0.32 n  7 sam- ples one-way ANOVA oxic and intermediate F  22.63 p  0.01 and oxic and anoxic samples F  26.72 p  0.01 also significantly different with non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests p  0.01.

The anoxic sediment samples had a B value of 7.88 - 0.31 n  7 and the differences were non-significant with the other groups.The dominant taxa in the microbial communities from the oxic intermediate and anoxic sediments were affili- ated with the Delta- Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria plus Bacteroidetes Fig.

RNA transcripts annotated for aerobic sulfide oxidation to sul- fate were higher in the anoxic-to-oxic and intermediate- to-oxic cores compared to the anoxic controls or intermediate cores turned anoxic.

On the species level fccB and dsrA were ascribed to the sulfide oxidizer Allochromatium vinosum the Chromatiaceae family was present in the 16S rRNA gene data.In the anoxic control RNA transcripts annotated as sulfite reductase dsvA acting in anaerobic dissimilatory sulfate reduction were higher FPKM 128 and 192 FPKM for each anoxic control replicate compared to all other treatments that had FPKM values below 80.

Finally tetrathionate reductase RNA transcript ttrB en- coding anaerobic reduction of tetrathionate S4O2- to thiosulfate S2O2-  was higher in anoxic-to-oxic 156 to 198 FPKM and intermediate-to-oxic 217 to382 FPKM compared to the anoxic control and intermediate-to-anoxic that had FPKM values below 60 and 110 respectively.RNA transcripts coding for organic sulfur compound cycling by anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO reduc- tase dmsA that converts DMSO to dimethyl sulfide DMS were higher in the anoxic-to-oxic 1640 to1993 FPKM and intermediate-to-oxic treatments 2060 to 2795 FPKM compared to the anoxic control and intermediate-to-anoxic with FPKM values below 400 and 1250 FPKM respectively.
