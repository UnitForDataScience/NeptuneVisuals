viruses are also abundant in the gut  and may also impact asd symptoms by modulating the abundance evolutionary trajectories and metabolic outputs of gut microbiota like they do in other environments .interest in rebalancing human gut microbiota to treat disease is growing diet antibiotics probiotics pre- biotics and fecal microbiota transplants are treatments with reported potential -for asd however only temporary symptom improvements have been reported from vancomycin treatment and probiotics have had mixed clinical results with minimal microbiota ana- lysis or long-term follow-up .

in children with asd a small open-label study found that 8 weeks of treatment with oral vancomycin a non-absorbable anti- biotic which acts only in the gut led to major improve- ments in both gi symptoms and asd symptoms although the benefits were lost within a few weeks after treatment was stopped 2. thus gut microbiota appearsstrongly associated with asd.

briefly a modified fmt protocol termed microbiota transfer therapy mtt involved 14 days of oral vancomycin treatment followed by 12-24 h fasting with bowel cleansing then re- populating gut microbiota by administering a high initial dose of standardized human gut microbiota shgm either orally or rectally followed by daily lowermaintenance oral doses with a stomach acid suppressant for 7-8 weeks.

this report focuses on the safety and tolerability of mtt and its effects on microbiota gi symptoms and other asd-related symptoms.methodsgoalthe goals of the study were to follow gut microbiota in healthy and treated children with asd longitudinally as well as to evaluate an investigational new treatment mtt for its effectiveness in children with asd in treating both gi symptoms primary outcome and asd-related symptoms secondary outcomes and to determine the ef- fect of mtt on the gut microbiome.study designthe general study design was an open-label clinical trial involving 18 children with asd ages 7-16 years who were diagnosed by the autism diagnostic interview- revised adi-r and had moderate to severe gastro- intestinal problems.

the lower maintenance shgm doses were self-administered orally every day up to the end of week 10. after treatment was stopped participants were monitored for another 8 weeks.standardized human gut microbiotainstead of pure stool this study involved the use of stan- dardized human gut microbiota that is  99 bacteria and prepared as previously described using stool from healthy individuals as starting material briefly do- nors underwent rigorous screening that involved regular questionnaires review of medical history and physical examinations to rule out infectious disease metabolic syndrome gastrointestinal disorders and neurologic or neurodevelopmental problems.

c unweighted unifrac distances between asd gut microbiota and most relevant donor sample initial donor sample at weeks 0 and 3 most recent maintenance dose sample at weeks 10 and 18. green line indicates the median interpersonal variation between neurotypical controls and illustrates that prior to treatment the difference in gut microbiota composition between mtt recipients and donors was on the order of normal interpersonal variation.

specifically overall bacterial diversity and the abundance of bifidobacterium prevotella and desulfovibrio among other taxa increased following mtt and these changes persisted after treatment stopped followed for 8 weeks.conclusions this exploratory extended-duration treatment protocol thus appears to be a promising approach to alter the gut microbiome and virome and improve gi and behavioral symptoms of asd.

consistent with this ex- periments done in an asd mouse model demonstrated that augmentation with bacteroides fragilis alone could alter gut microbiota and blood metabolite profiles correct increased gut permeability gaps in cell-to-cell junctions and improve asd-associated behaviors .

therefore asd's gi and behavioral symptoms may derive at least in part from gut microbiota dysbiosis and fmt may ef- fectively rebalance the gut microbiota and alleviate some gi and asd symptoms.fmt therapy usually involves only a single dose for re- current c. difficile infection  and other gi conditions although there is a growing interest in the use of several doses .

higher gut bacterial diversity and richness are commonly associated with healthy status presumably due to resilience afforded by higher functional redundancy .importantly the donor bacterial community was atleast partially engrafted in the recipient gut consistent with earlier work and a recent study of the efficacy of fmt specifically the unweighted unifrac dis- tance i.e.

.while the role of phages in the gut is largely under- studied in comparison to the role of bacteria this study and recent research has begun to uncover the potential role of phages in the gut.

this shift in viral community structure is hypothesized to allow potentially harmful bacteria andviruses to proliferate through phage-mediated dysbiosis whereby perturbations to the healthy gut phage commu- nity leads to increased abundances of phages and se- lected reduction in bacterial species -studies looking at the effects of perturbations in the gut from crohn's disease in humans  and from diet in mice show this response with increased diversity of phage communities paired with decreased diversity of the bacterial community.

this shifted gut microbiota of children with asd toward that of neurotypical children is consistent with the hypothesis that gut microbiota may be at least partially responsible for gi and asd symptoms.

here a small open-label clinical trial evaluated the impact of microbiota transfer therapy mtt on gut microbiota composition and gi and asd symptoms of 18 asd-diagnosed children.results mtt involved a 2-week antibiotic treatment a bowel cleanse and then an extended fecal microbiota transplant fmt using a high initial dose followed by daily and lower maintenance doses for 7-8 weeks.

many chil- dren with asd often undergo increased oral antibiotic treatment during the first 3 years of life  which is thought to destabilize their gut microbiota  and open opportunities for competitive potential pathogens to con- tribute to asd severity  .
