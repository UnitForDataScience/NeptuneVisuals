This report focuses on the safety and tolerability of MTT and its effects on microbiota GI symptoms and other ASD-related symptoms.MethodsGoalThe goals of the study were to follow gut microbiota in healthy and treated children with ASD longitudinally as well as to evaluate an investigational new treatment MTT for its effectiveness in children with ASD in treating both GI symptoms primary outcome and ASD-related symptoms secondary outcomes and to determine the ef- fect of MTT on the gut microbiome.Study designThe general study design was an open-label clinical trial involving 18 children with ASD ages 7-16 years who were diagnosed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised ADI-R and had moderate to severe gastro- intestinal problems.

g. Initially the relative abundance of Prevotella was comparable be- tween neurotypical children and children with ASD at baseline which was not consistent with our previous co- hort study with 20 neurotypical children and 19 children with ASD .

A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study is the next step to investigate the value of MTT in treating children with ASD and GI problems.Additional filesAbbreviationsABC Aberrant Behavior Checklist ADHD Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADI-R Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ASD Autism spectrum disorder BMI Body mass index CARS Childhood Autism Rating ScaleDSR Daily stool records FDA Food and Drug Administration FMT Fecal microbiota transplant GI Gastrointestinal GMP Good manufacturing processes GSRS Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale MTT Microbiota transfer therapy NMDS Nonmetric multidimensional scaling OTUs Operational taxonomic units PGI-III Parent Global Impressions-III QIIME Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology SHGM Standardized human gut microbiota SRS Social Responsiveness Scale VABS-II Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale IIAcknowledgementsWe gratefully thank all the children with ASD neurotypical children and their families for participating in the study.

This shifted gut microbiota of children with ASD toward that of neurotypical children is consistent with the hypothesis that gut microbiota may be at least partially responsible for GI and ASD symptoms.

In children with ASD a small open-label study found that 8 weeks of treatment with oral vancomycin a non-absorbable anti- biotic which acts only in the gut led to major improve- ments in both GI symptoms and ASD symptoms although the benefits were lost within a few weeks after treatment was stopped 2.

Viruses are also abundant in the gut  and may also impact ASD symptoms by modulating the abundance evolutionary trajectories and metabolic outputs of gut microbiota like they do in other environments .Interest in rebalancing human gut microbiota to treat disease is growing Diet antibiotics probiotics pre- biotics and fecal microbiota transplants are treatments with reported potential -For ASD however only temporary symptom improvements have been reported from vancomycin treatment and probiotics have had mixed clinical results with minimal microbiota ana- lysis or long-term follow-up .

A number of studies re- ported that children with ASD have altered gut bacteria profiles compared with neurotypcial children - al- though in certain cohorts no significant difference has been reported  .

After treatment was stopped participants were monitored for another 8 weeks.Standardized human gut microbiotaInstead of pure stool this study involved the use of stan- dardized human gut microbiota that is  99 bacteria and prepared as previously described using stool from healthy individuals as starting material Briefly do- nors underwent rigorous screening that involved regular questionnaires review of medical history and physical examinations to rule out infectious disease metabolic syndrome gastrointestinal disorders and neurologic or neurodevelopmental problems.

Specifically overall bacterial diversity and the abundance of Bifidobacterium Prevotella and Desulfovibrio among other taxa increased following MTT and these changes persisted after treatment stopped followed for 8 weeks.Conclusions This exploratory extended-duration treatment protocol thus appears to be a promising approach to alter the gut microbiome and virome and improve GI and behavioral symptoms of ASD.

FDA limited our pilot study to older children ages 7-17 years since most FMT studies have been conducted on adults and there was very limited data and knowledge of the impact and usage of FMT for younger children.
