The aim of this study was to characterize probiotics SM1 and SM2 which were isolated from the intestine of rainbow trout and have health benefits in aquaculture  .Materials and MethodsBacteriaCultures SM1 and SM2 which were confirmed previously as probiotics - were isolated from the gut of juvenile average weight  10-15 g rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum.

As a result Kocuria SM1 and Rhodococcus SM2 were recovered from the digestive tract of rainbow trout after 14 days feeding with diets supplemented with these probiotics .The anti-adhesion activity of probiotics against pathogens may be explained by the secretion of antimicrobial substances such as antibiotics or siderophores by these bacteria  .Table 4 Effect of pepsin and pancreatin on the growth of SM1 and SM2Growth was recorded as positive  No growth was recorded as negative -Table 5 Results of the API-ZYMtest for SM1 and SM2Enzyme assayedSubstrateaEnzyme activity of strainba Substrate 6-Br-2-naphthyl-aD-galactopyranoside a 2-naphthyl-bD-galactopyranoside b Naphthol-AS-BI- bD-glucuronide c 2-naphthyl-aD-glucopyranoside d 6-Br-2-naphthyl-bD-glucopyranoside e 1-naphthyl- N-acetyl-bD-glucosamide f 6-Br-2-naphthyl-aD-mannopyranoside g 2-naphthyl-aL-fucopyranoside h L- leucyl-2-naphthylamide i L-valyl-2-naphthylamide j L-cystyl-2-naphthylamide k N-benzoyl-DL-arginine- 2-naphthylamide l N-glutaryl-phenylalanine-2-naphthylamide m 2-naphthyl butyrate n 2-naphthyl caprylate o 2-naphthyl myristate p 2-naphthyl phosphate q 2-naphthyl phosphate r Naphthol-AS-BI- phosphate sb Numbers indicate the relative magnitude of enzyme activityIn this respect bacterial siderophores are high-affinity FeIII chelators for the acquisition of iron under iron-limitingTable 6Antibacterial activity of secondary metabolites of SM1 and SM2conditions which could limit iron for potential pathogens to proliferate  .

Neither SM1 nor SM2 was siderophoreTable 7Antibiotic sensitivity profile of SM1 and SM2 S sensitive MS moderately sensitive  4-6 mm zone of clearing R resistantpositive although some bacteria of the genera Kocuria and Rhodococcus not regarded as probiotics have been reported to produce siderophores  .The presence of antimicrobial resistance traits among probiotics could be problematic in terms of food and public health safety issues.

Conversely probiotics with intrinsic antibiotic resis- tance factors could be desirable during and after periods of chemotherapy by allowing the re-colonization of the digestive tract .ConclusionKocuria SM1 and Rhodococcus SM2 which have been pre- viously demonstrated to be effective probiotics for use in rain- bow trout displayed characteristics which may explain why they are so effective for use in aquaculture.

The secondary metabolites of both probiotics were inhibitory to Acinetobacter baumannii Vibrio anguillarum and V. ordalii SM2 inhibited Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
