Pg was similar in peri- odontitis and peri-implantitis in three of four stud- ies.94346 However Pi Cr and Tf were more frequent in periodontitis than peri-implantitis.93843 Only one of four studies did not find differences in frequencies of periodontopathic microorganisms between teeth and implants.46 Enteric rods were recovered more frequently and at higher levels in peri-implantitis compared with periodontitis38 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sa and Candida albicans were frequent in peri- implantitis suggesting they may be associated with implant failure.46Comparison of Peri-Implantitis With Healthy Implants and Periodontitis Using Sequencing MethodsIn studies19444751 that used sequencing techniquesresults differed from those obtained using other techniques to compare healthy implants and peri- implantitis.172739-4349 Most bacterial species found in healthy implants were also detected in peri- implantitis.19 However Pm Pi and Fn were found in higher proportions in peri-implantitis consortia compared with healthy implants in the same in- dividuals.4447 Pg only was observed to be in higher proportions in peri-implantitis consortia in one study.44 Other non-cultivable microorganisms were associated with peri-implantitis when the entire microbiome was evaluated by sequence techniques including asaccharolytic anaerobic Gram-positive rod AAGPR associated species such as Eubacte- rium nodatum Eubacterium brachy Eubacterium saphenum Filifactor alocis Slackia exigua and Parascardovia denticolens.44 Dialister invisus Eu- bacterium infirmum Actinomyces cardiffensis Eu- bacterium minutum and Gemella sanguinis as well as anaerobic Gram-negative rods OGNRs such as Mitsuokella sp.

Teeth with periodontitis healthy implants or implants with peri-implantitis were colonized by periodontal microorganisms.

Likewise the bacterial profile differences of healthy and diseased dental implants have also been studied.1112 Biofilm profiles of peri-implantitis and healthy implants have shown controversial results.

Despite the presence of periodontopathic microorganisms in peri-implantitis sites some studies did not find differences in frequencies between healthy sites and peri-implant disease.91314 Observational studies914-17 assessing colonization of microorganisms around dental implants have suggested that these microorganisms could colonize the peri- implant sulcus of healthy implants in patients with periodontal disease.

Recently data on the entire microbiome of peri-implantitis with comparisons to periodontitis and healthy implants were published10 but these were not included in previously published reviews.Therefore the aim of this SR is to describe mi- crobiologic profiles of peri-implantitis periodontitis and healthy implants based on studies that evaluated microbial biofilms and entire microbiomes to estab- lish similarities and differences.

cross-sectional case-control and cohort were considered eligible for inclusion.ParticipantsPopulationParticipants included adult patients treated with dental implants who were diagnosed with peri-implantitis and those with healthy implants or periodontitis.

In total 1145 patients with 2134 implants were assessed in the 26 cross-sectional studies studies7910131416-192736-4648-52 that were included in this review.Differences in Microbial Biofilms of Peri- Implantitis and Healthy ImplantsA total of 21 studies comparing microbial profiles of peri-implantitis and healthy implants were evaluatedTable 1.Characteristics of Included StudiesTable 1. continuedCharacteristics of Included StudiesNR  not reported.using different microbiologic methods two used methods of cultivation3740 two conventional polymerase chain reaction PCR3843 three quantitative PCR161750 one nested-PCR14 eight DNA hybridization913273639414249 and five DNA sequencing methods.1819444751 The major periodontopathic microorganisms red complex Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg Tannerella for- sythia Tf and Treponema denticola Td orange complex Prevotella intermedia Pi and Fuso- bacterium nucleatum Fn and other microorgan- isms Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Aa Eikenella corrodens Ec Parvimonas micra Pm and Campylobacter rectus Cr were identified in 11 of 21 studies 52.3.914161737394043495052Three studies also evaluated opportunistic microor- ganisms.374052 Five studies using DNA hybridization evaluated between 36 and 40 species including the major periodontopathic microorganisms.1327364142 Table 2.
