Differential multiclass fold change analysis revealed 64 OTUs that differentiated treatment time points across HC-G and CRC-G groups C. These included the enrich- ment of B fragilis OTU LEfSe OTU488 adjusted P  .05 in the CRC-G group at 32 weeks and depletions of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii OTUs LEfSe OTU23 adjusted P  .001 OTU578 adjusted P  .001 Clostridium cluster OTUs LEfSe OTU116 adjusted P  .001 OTU150 adjusted P  .001 and numerous Lachnospiraceae OTUs LEfSe OTU161 adjusted P  .001 OTU190 adjusted P  .001 OTU295 adjusted P  .001 OTU170 adjusted P  .001 OTU334 adjusted P  .001 OTU434 adjusted P  .05 in the CRC-G group at 8 and 32 weeks after stool gavage.CRC Stool Increases Expression of Proinflammatory Genes in AOM and Germ-free MiceTo gain insights into the molecular basis underlying the pro-tumorigenic effect of the stool from patientswith CRC we studied the gene expression profile of colonic cells at 8 weeks after gavage in the AOM model and at 20 weeks after gavage in the germ-free model.

Although the difference in Ki-67 protein expression did not reach statistical significance P  .05 C we observed increased PCNA immunostaining P  .01 D and protein expression in Western blot P  .05 E as well as a higher active b-catenin protein expression in Western blot P  .05 F in the CRC-GFigure 1.

P  .05 P  .01 P  .001We fed human stool to AOM-treated mice to study the effect of gut microbiota on intestinal tumorigenesis.

RESULTS Significantly higher proportions of conventional mice fed with stool from in- dividuals with CRC than control stool developed high-grade dysplasia P  .05 and macroscopic polyps P  .01.

Three mice harbored high-grade dysplasia in the colon in the CRC-A group 311 27.3 C and D compared with none in the HC-A or NC-A groups P  .05  C and D. Nine mice were observed to have histological inflammation in the CRC-A group 911 81.8 significantly more than the 2 other groups 822 36.4 P  .05 .

Nevertheless we observed increased epithelial cell proliferation in the colons of the CRC-G group compared with the HC-G group at 20 weeks 50.2 vs 47.2 P  .05 and 32 weeks 48.6 vs 40.0 P  .05 after stool gavage as indicated by a higher proportion of Ki-67-positive cells B.

Reanalyzing sequence data from our pre- vious metagenome-wide association studyPERMANOVA showed that the case-control status was a significant factor affecting the microbial profile AOM group P  .05 germ- free group P  .05.

We observed a signif- icantly lower bacterial richness in the CRC-A group sobs P  .01 Chao1 P  .001 B.
