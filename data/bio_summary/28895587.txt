For instance in the USA Western society's archetypal country  70 of adults are overweight or obese according to the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.The relevance of obesity worldwide has fostered a continualsearch for improved models for studying obesity and among these one of the most frequently used is the diet-induced obesityDIO model.In the DIO models which provide highly human-like models numerous obesity-inducing diets are used including high-fat diets HFDs and cafeteria diets CAFs.In HFDs various fat sources are used in different proportions but no consensus exists regarding which HFD is the most appropriate thus the phenotypes observed as well as the physiological and biochem- ical parameters might vary between different studies and thereby make comparisons between them challenging.In turn because CAFs are composed of diverse highly palatable energy-dense foods for example cheese cake salami and cookies that contain substantial amounts of salt sugar and fat CAFs simulate relatively more closely the human Western diet WD.Furthermore CAFs induce obesity and related disorders more efficiently than the traditional HFDs.However CAFs have been criticized for being even less standardized than the predefined HFDs.Because each1Centro de Estudos em Estresse Oxidativo--Departamento de Bioquimica - Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude--Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS Porto Alegre RS Brasil 2Departamento de Ingenieria Civil y Ambiental--Universidad de la Costa Barranquilla Atlantico Colombia and 3Departamento de Educacao em Saude-- Campus Universitario Professor Antonio Garcia Filho--Universidade Federal de Sergipe UFS Lagarto SE Brasil.

For instance Sampey and colleagues obtained distinct results when they compared obesogenic diets with a commercial standard chow or a matched low-fat diet.Lastly because CAFs are more prone to breaking and crumbling than other diets the diet can be easily lost among wood shavings as we observed here and this prevents accurate measurement of food consumption.The microbiota plays a critical role in the development of obesity and obesity-associated dysfunctions and transplantation of the microbiota from obese mice into lean mice is sufficient to make the lean mice obese.However our data revealed that certain obesogenic diets for example our WD might induce obesity and obesity-related comorbidities in the absence of marked gut microbiota alterations in this study the WD effect was different only when compared with control diet 5 corroborating previous findings.Although mild compared to gut microbiota changes in rats fed CAF these gut microbiota changes may still be involved in the development of obesity and obesity- related disorders.

The gut microbiota data are of particular interest since there is an accumulation of evidence that suggests that gut microbiota composition might be associated with the development of obesity and obesity-associated disorders.To establish which diet model is the most robust and reproducible for studying obesity we compared the prototypic WD developed by us with the two traditional obesogenic diets namely HFD and CAF.

Among Archaea the abundance of VadinCA11 a genus included in the phylum Euryarchaeota was diminished in CAF-fed rats Supplementary Figure S4h which agrees with the decrease seen in Euryarchaeota 4h.The abundance of five genera was altered in gut microbiota from WD-fed ratsThe aforementioned findings showed that WD induced more obesity hallmarks than HFD and CAF suggesting that WD induces an obesity phenotype more closely related to humans.

An elevated body mass index is a major risk factor for several complications including diabetes cardiovascular disease cancer and gastrointestinal diseases and thus it contributes to the overall disease burden worldwide.Moreover obesity prevalence has increased worldwide at an alarming rate primarily due to reduced physical activity and Westernization of dietary habits.

We hypothesized that our prototypic WD as compared to HFD or CAF would provide a more adequate model of human obesity and we confirmed thisthrough appropriate metabolic characterization.

Western diet WD was the most effective in promoting obesity.

Results were statistically evaluated using SPSS 20 SPSS Inc. Chicago IL USA and graphics were generated using GraphPad Prism 7 GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego CA USA and STAMP 2.1.3 software.RESULTSWD most effectively promoted obesityExcessive fat accumulation is a hallmark of obesity and hyperphagia is a common characteristic among rats fed palatable dietstherefore we first measured food intake and animal weight.

Significant differences are indicated by P o0.05 P o0.01 or P o0.001 for obesogenic diets vs control and P o0.05  P o0.01 or  P o0.001 for comparison between obesogenic diets ANOVA followed by Tukey except hepatic steatosis for which a Chi-square test was applied.commonly used to induce obesity in rodent models did not cause a significantly greater amount of fat accumulation compared to the control diet.
