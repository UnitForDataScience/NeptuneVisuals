A cocktail of probiotics has been shown to alter brain activity as monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging and Bifidobacterium longum was reported to alter brain electrical activity.Conclusions It has yet to be convincingly demonstrated that the exciting findings of psychobiotic efficacy demonstrated in preclinical models of psychiatric illness will translate to patients.Key words brain-gut-microbiota axis psychobiotics depression autism anxiety schizophrenia.INTRODUCTIONhe complexity of psychiatric illnesses cannot be underesti- mated and despite major advances in molecular neurobiology and neuroimaging there have been no major advances in therapeu- tics.

The mechanisms of signal transmission in the brain-gut-microbiota axis are complex and involve bidirectional communications that enable gut microbes to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with the microbes.

1 is a bidirectional communi- cation system that enables gut microbes to communicate with the brain and the brain in turn to communicate with the gut 15.
