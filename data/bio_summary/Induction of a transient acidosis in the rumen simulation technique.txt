dairy cattle are particularly susceptible in early to mid-lactation when dmi and concentrate proportion are increased to fulfil the higher energy requirements of milk production krause and oetzel 2006 dohme et al.

the number of fibrolytic bacteria decreases while amylolytic bacte- ria proliferate which may produce lactate mackie and gilchrist 1979 russell and hino 1980fernando et al.

2010. if the extent of scfa pro- duction exceeds the resorption capacity of the una- dapted rumen epithelium and buffering by saliva rumen ph declines and subacute or acute rumen acidosis might occur.the definition of subacute rumen acidosis sara is inconsistent for single assessment commonly used ph thresholds are ph 5.0-5.5 enemark et al.

2002 or ph  5.6 owens et al.

1998 with the establish- ment of indwelling ph probes cows are often classi- fied based on the time or area under the curve for ph5.6 or 5.8 krause et al.

2009 penner et al.

2009. lactate concentrations rarely exceed 10 mm in suba- cute acidosis krause and oetzel 2005 khafipour et al.

2009b whereas large amounts of lactate are produced in acute rumen acidosis and ph declines below 5.0 or 5.2 owens et al.

1998 enemark et al.

2002. while acute acidosis can result in anorexiadiarrhoea systemic symptoms and death of the animal brown et al.

2000 minuti et al.

2014 subacute acidosis is less obvious but occurs at a high frequency kleen et al.

2013. varying feed intake reduced fae- ces texture and reduced milk yield are discussed as symptoms enemark et al.

a com- mon strategy to induce short-term acidosis is feed restriction followed by a highly digestible meal which might be introduced directly into the rumen of the cattle dohme et al.

2008 petri et al.
