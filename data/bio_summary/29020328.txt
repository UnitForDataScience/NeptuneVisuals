clostridium difficile fecal microbiota transplantation mortality survival treatment.clostridium difficile infection cdi is an emerging worldwide public health concern associated with substantial mortality and recurrence 1-3. the mortality rate dramatically increased from 1.5 before 2000 to 4-6 and 7-17 in recent endemic and epidemic periods respectively in the united states 2. the mor- tality rate for severe infection is much higher reaching 36-58 without surgery and 32-57 with surgery 4-7 with no signif- icant difference in the largest meta-analysis to date 8. moreover only 30 of patients with severe cdi underwent surgery in rela- tion to a selection bias 8. the emerging epidemic hypervirulent o27 ribotype has been associated with high mortality 9 64 in our unit in 2013-2014 10. the binary toxin is also considered as a virulence factor associated with cdi severity 11. other pre- dictive factors of mortality include age usual comorbidities sever- ity and specifically inflammatory bowel disease 12 13. among antimicrobial agents to treat cdi vancomycin was shown to bereceived 18 may 2017 editorial decision 27 july 2017 accepted 22 august 2017 publishedonline august 24 2017.correspondence m. million institut hospitalo-universitaire mediterranee infection 19-21 boulevard jean moulin 13005 marseille france matthieumilliongmail.com.clinical infectious diseasesr 2018665645-50c the authors 2017. published by oxford university press for the infectious diseases society of america.

the efficacy of fmt on recurrence has been reported to range from 70 to 100 in several studies in the literature supplementary table 1. the dramatic efficacy of fmt vs van- comycin was demonstrated on the absence of relapse 23 24. we first showed that early fmt improved survival in patients with cdi caused by the hypervirulent o27 ribotype 10. in severe cdi the efficacy of fmt in preventing recurrences and decreasing the duration of symptoms has been demonstrated though not the efficacy against mortality 25 26. subsequently we successfully treated 2 patients with non-o27 ribotype cdi but with severe colitis including 1 patient in the intensive care unit 27. based on the continuing ongoing epidemic the demon- strated efficacy of fmt in the cdi context the demonstrated biological mechanism disruption of the gut microbiota during cdi restored by fmt 28 29 and the relatively good safety and long-term tolerance 30-32 we subsequently proposed earlyfmt to all cdi patients hospitalized in our unit regardless of comorbidities ribotype recurrence or severity.

regarding our study 1 patients with severe cdi withoutfmt had a very severe prognosis with very high mortality 30-60 2 fmt has a good safety profile compared with cdi and surgery 3 the potential benefit was sufficiently high or 0.2 41 to be unambiguous 4 the scientific ration- ale including all available clinical studies taking recurrence as outcome and basic research studies on microbiota restoration was sufficiently strong for the result to be generally acceptedsurgery usually proposed as salvage therapy in severe cases was not an appropriate treatment to serve as a control because it could be proposed only in selected patients 30 the benefit was not demonstrated mortality remained very high in oper- ated patients 32-57 4-8 and the quality of life in survi- vors is strongly altered 6 directness seemed optimal as our study conducted in the epicenter and period of a c. difficile epi- demic 9 included a population that would benefit the most from first-line fmt including the oldest mean age 82 years the most sick severe patients were not excluded in contrast to many published studies and those with the most comorbiditiesbased on a high charlson score and high prevalence rates of bedridden and dementia in our population 7 the outcome was critical mortality from any cause and not questionable no surrogate 8 the risk-benefit ratio was high and 9 the cost use of resources for society was quite reasonable as the procedure was already routinely performed in the frequent indications currently accepted recurrence.

this issue illustrates the parachute paradigm 42 43. alternatively we advocate confirming this benefit in nonrand- omized studies taking as controls those who refuse treatment in our experience a very small minority of patients with severe disease in view of the suffering and anxiety associated with severe cdi or with controlled before-and-after studies.additional studies are needed to clarify the short- and long- term complications and the few contraindications of fmt via any route colonic fmt could be used in patients with ileus or occlusive syndrome.
