Addi- tionally prebiotic administration during chronic stress normal- ized the effects of stress on behavior neurochemistry and the stress axis.

SCFAs produced by gut bacteria influence other commensals and are important to gut physiology but they are also part of microbiota-host signaling systems that extend beyond the gut .

Evidence is accumulating to show that microbiota influence brain function and behavior particularly brain systems related to mood and emotions .

Together studies to date clearly have demonstrated that the complex interplay among our commensal bacteria our body and our brain are critical to normal healthy brain function and understanding these interactions may provide new ave- nues for interventions to improve outcomes in psychiatric disorders.The potential of psychobiotics as interventions in psy- chiatry is of great interest.

To identify the molecular mechanisms that mediate beneficial effects of prebiotics the authors examined SCFAs a byproduct of prebiotic administration and suggest that changes in SCFAs may mediate the impact of prebiotics on brain systems and behavior.

In the study 10 weeks of prebiotic administration FOS alone GOS alone or a combi- nation of FOS 1 GOS in healthy male adult mice resulted in changes in the composition of gut microbiota and related changes in SCFAs .

It is important to note that there is specificity in the nature of bacterial production of SCFAs  and although the evidence suggests that these metabolites may mediate some of the beneficial effects of diet interven- tions additional approaches are needed to directly asses the source and action of SCFAs in animal and human studies.As noted above probiotics on the market and showing beneficial effects on mental health and brain function are limited in number.

provides convincing evidence for beneficial effects of prebiotics on microbiota- brain systems in healthy mice and in stress conditions.

In this fast-moving field of research the key questions remain is the growing attention to microbes and mood hype--or is there hope and opportunity for identifying novel approaches to improve mental healthMicrobiota cover all surfaces of our body and include bacteria viruses fungi parasites and protozoa however neuroscience and psychiatry research has focused predomi- nantly on gut microbiota.

Psychobiotics are live bacteria probiotics or other products prebiotics that when ingested confer mental health benefits through interactions with com- mensal gut bacteria .
