Our animal model of intestinal fibrosis may have its own limitations.The observed increase in neutrophils in the heterotopic transplantation model may be affected by immune response to intestinal grafts rejection ischemia or hypoxia which contributes to fibrosis in the animal model but not necessarily to fibrosis in IBD patients.Differences in the microbiome are likely to influence development of intestinal fibrosis.

To determine the relevance of MyD88 in the development of fibrosis MyD88-- and GFP-Tg mice were used as both donors and recipients for isogeneic transplantation in our heterotopic animal model of intestinal fibrosis.

Therefore MyD88 deficiency reduces intestinal inflammation at least with respect to Mmp9 expression and neutrophil infiltration whereas development of fibro- sis is similar in grafts of both MyD88 deficient and wildtype mice.DiscussionIn this study we investigated the role of MyD88 in the development and progression of fibrosis in an animal model of intestinal fibrosis.

This suggests that intestinal fibrosis does not require persistent microbal stimula- tion and could be independent from the MyD88 pathways from a certain time point onwards.There are also conflicting reports on the importance of the MyD88-dependent signalling in the developmentof fibrosis in other organs.

In contrast in other stud- ies using different models of fibrosis MyD88 signalling is less relevant for the development and progression of fibrosis.

Excessive tissue repair promotes fibrosis and impairs gastrointestinal function and is a common clinical problem in patients with IBD.The data presented here suggest that although inflammation is reduced by MyD88 deficiency the develop- ment of intestinal fibrosis is uncoupled from MyD88 signalling.

Intestinal fibrosis is reduced by early elimination of inflammation in a mouse model of IBD impact of a Top- Down approach to intestinal fibrosis in mice.

B. Rossel4 G. Rogler1 B. Misselwitz1  M. Hausmann1Dysregulation of the immune response to microbiota is associated with inflammatory bowel disease IBD which can trigger intestinal fibrosis.

MyD88 is a key component of microbiota signalling but its influence on intestinal fibrosis has not been clarified.
