The first would certainly come from the fact that the results pre- sented in the article are not those from a double-blind multicenter controlled pro- spective trial that would meet all the cri- teria usually requested for a pivotal study that would lead an agency--say the USprocess has been completed according to the highly respected standards of Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Clostridium difficile treatment transplantation fecal outcome.In this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases Marie Hocquart from the group of Matthieu Million from a single group of researchers from Marseilles University Hospitals France present results sug- gesting that early use of fecal microbiota transplantation FMT might be high- ly beneficial for patients with severe Clostridium difficile infection CDI 1.

So my very strong suggestion would be that at minimum a sample from all transplantations should be kept frozen and that all patients who receive a fecal transplant under the circumstancesdescribed here enter a national register and benefit from long-term follow-up.Another concern is that the idea that the cure of a disease as deadly as severe CDI is at hand would sterilize further research in the field.

Alterations of the microbiota may be associated with long-term metabolic or immunologic disorders which must make us cautious before claiming that replacing the patient's own microbiota by that of another person is without con- sequence.

That is around an 80 re- duction Moreover the number of patients with severe disease who would need to be treated to save one life at 3 months was as low as 2.

These markers are thoseproposed by experts from the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases a group the authors of the current article were not part of which certainly increases the strength of their results.

Given the high number of deaths current- ly attributed to CDI worldwide the public health benefit could be huge.So what now Is there room for contro- versy Will doctors who do not propose FMT for severe CDI be sued by attorneys defending families that suffer the loss of a patient who died in these circum- stances Can we imagine what would be the arguments of the defenders Indeed there are some.

A first reason is that the dramatic effect of FMT that is shown here proves by itself how important is the role of the microbiota in our homeostasis.

The problem is that the fecal microbiota is a highly complex material and we do Food and Drug Administration or thenot know exactly what is beneficial in itsReceived 9 August 2017 editorial decision 14 August 2017accepted 23 August 2017 published online August 24 2017.

That the com- position of the gut microbiota in health and diseases is currently the matter of so many researchers searching Google for these terms bring neatly half a million hits enlightens the complexity to fully define what safety means in the mat- ter.
