metabolomics vs. metabolomics cross-sectional and delta correlations are reported in supplementary table 2 supplementary table 3 supplementary table 4 and supplementary table 5 and visualized in figure 2 and supplementary figure 1. we assessed reproducibility of duplicate measurements across two clinical laboratories supplementary figure 8. as correlations between repeat measurements do not represent physiologically relevant information they are not included in our network or subsequent analysis.we performed community analysis using the method of girvan and newman 11. this method involves iteratively calculating edge betweenness centrality on a network the number of weighted shortest paths from all vertices to all other vertices that pass over that edge.

at every iteration of the community analysis we computed the modularity and analyzed the communities at the iteration which maximized this quantity supplementary figure 2.ols regression on the dependent variable homa-ir with regressors including sex ggt gamma-glutamyltyrosine age and body mass index was performed supplementary table 7. to test for heteroscedasticity in our homa-ir regression model we fit the model using white's heteroscedasticity-consistent estimator hce testing for the effects of outliers using a robust regression model and testing for multicollinearity by calculating the variance inflation factors vif for each predictor.generalized estimating equations gee were used to estimate the average change in each clinical analyte by round while controlling for the effects of age sex and self-reported ancestry table 1 and supplementary table 10. an independence working correlation structure was used in the gee.software packagesnygc used bwa v0.7.8-r455 to align sequences.
