Authors generally agreed on the concept of bioaccessibility of phenolics during gastrointestinal digestion or large intestine fermentation as the ratio between phenolics in the small or large intestine respectively and the total phenolic com- pound content of a given food.In the present study gluten-free pasta residues obtained after a sim- ulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were subjected to colonic fer- mentation using pig faeces inocula with the aim to study the portion of phenolic compounds that could reach the large intestine through un- digested food matrices to become available for colonic microbiota.

Residues from different incubations of the same GF pasta samples were pooled.The large intestine fermentation of the resulting pooled post-hydro- lysis GF pasta residues was conducted according to the in vitro approachTable 1Ingredients along with the label indications on chemical composition g of six different gluten-free GF pasta samples are reported.

those at the bottom of the fold-change- based matrix increased their content from the 0 h to 8 h time point dur- ing the fermentation process.Bioaccessibility and stability of different phenolic classes during the in vitro large intestine fermentation stepTo evaluate and compare the stability of different phenolic classes in the in vitro large intestine fermentation model fold-change analysis FC was performed.

The GF pasta samples 2 g were cooked to optimum in 60 ml of boiling water drained for 1 min cut into small pieces in a mortar to simulate mastication and then analysed.Simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion modelThe adopted procedure included two distinct phases a pre-incuba- tion with digestive enzymes followed by an in vitro large intestine fer- mentation process.

Therefore they are not expected to have such a long residence time in the large intestine and the results from 24 h of in vitro fermentation are better intended as a condition to understand the long-term fate of phenolics in this trait of the intestine.In general the production of these large intestine catabolites arising from phenolics could be evidenced regardless the phenolic source considered.

Considering the total SCFAs and butyrate production during the in vitro fermentation different fermentation kinetics were observed among GF pasta post-hydrolysis residues.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This may be a concern since indications suggest that a GF diet in itself may change the composition immune function and ac- tivity of the gut microbiota .Therefore the aim of this study was to apply an in vitro faecal fer- mentation model to investigate the fate of phenolic compounds along with SCFAs fermentation kinetics following the consumption of com- mercially available GF pasta with different ingredient compositions.MaterialsandmethodsGluten-free pasta and preparationsA set of six commercially available GF pasta samples respectively black rice chickpea red lentil sorghum amaranth and quinoa enriched was used.

According to the intrinsic degradability of each GF pasta the pre-incubation step was repeated 6 to 18 times to obtain enough hydro- lysed residues for the subsequent in vitro large intestine fermentation step.

To bet- ter understand the fate of various phenolics within the gut after the in vitro large intestine fermentation model the entire phenolic profile of raw GF pasta was first investigated.
