however it is nonetheless non-redun- dant for the secretion of il-22 by th17 cells a cytokine vital for the anti-microbial properties of th17 cells -.il-23 is an important cytokine for th17 cell biology.

this review will summarize the current knowledge regarding the th17 cell-enterocyte crosstalk and give an overview of its clinical implications.keywords th17 cells inflammatory bowel diseases colorectal cancer enterocytes inflammatory bowel disease ibd and carcinogenesisthe gastrointestinal tract is essential for the absorption of nutrition and serves as a crucial barrier to protect the host against pathogens.

il-6 signaling leads to the activation of stat3 and subsequent induction ofrorgt one of the key transcription factors of th17 cells and of other th17 cell-related factors such as il-17af and il-23r -.

th17 cells and th17 cell-associated cytokines are also involved during crc in humans.

th17 cells were found elevated in tumors of crc patients and an increased th17 cell immune response correlates with advanced stages of crc -.in summary four main components lead to the pathology of ibd genetic predisposition environmental factors intestinal microbiome and a dysregulated immune system.

however tgf-b can negatively regulate th1 and th2 while promoting th17 cell differentiation and thereforefavors the contribution of th17 cells .

accordingly research led to the discovery that il-23 is essential for the effector proper- ties of th17 cells rather than their induction  .in the following sections we want to outline the effects of th17 cell-associated cytokines such as il-17a il-22 and tnf- a on epithelial cells during ibd and carcinogenesis.il-17a during inflammation andcarcinogenesisil-17a is a member of the il-17 family consisting of il-17a il-17-b il-17-c il-17-d il-17e and il-17f .

first clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines related to th17 cells such as il-17a show similar results to those obtained in murine ibd models and highlight the need to make a clear distinction between the biological functions of il-17a and th17 cells in general.

it can be hypothesized that ilc-derived il-22 is crucial in the initial phases of inflammatory responses whereas in chronically inflamed tissue t cell become the major producers as suggested by basu et al.
