longer amplicon sizes were preferred because of their suitability for sequencing to determine virus lineages.to determine the assay specificity in the presence of mosquito rna the four different primer pairs zikv- f  r3 f  r4 f2  r3 and f3  r4 were first tested with rna extracted from mosquito pools spiked with zikv table and pools that were not spiked with zikv rna additional file table s2.

the amount of mosquito- derived rna varied based on the species as well as tis- sues used whole mosquitoes versus head and thorax only and reached levels similar to rna extracted from virus cultures  1000 ngml.

the results summa- rized in table showed that the sybr green assay was 100 specific and produced either an equal or better sensitivity profile as compared to the probe-based assay.

even though the assay was opti- mized by using two zikv strains of both asian and african genotypes the primers flank relatively conserved re- gions of zikv genome indicating the universal ap- plicability of our assay for the detection of genetically diverse zikv strains.
