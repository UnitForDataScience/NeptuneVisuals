quinquefasciatus RNA was 10 1 and 100 PFUml re- spectively indicating at least one log drop of sensitivity in the presence of mosquito RNA Table Of two ref- erence strains tested the assay generated better detec- tion sensitivity for the Asian genotype of ZIKV PLCalZV Table which is attributable to the recent emergence of ZIKV in the Americas and Asia Over- all the detection sensitivity of the newly developed assay for ZIKV in mosquitoes was comparable to that of a probe-based assay described previously Table Evaluation of the assay in ZIKV infected field caught mosquitoesTo determine the applicability of the SYBR Green rRT- PCR assay for ZIKV surveillance in field-caught mosqui- toes during disease outbreaks we screened a panel of Ae.

Forty units of RNaseOUTfor ZIKV by using a probe-base rRT-PCR assay as de- scribed elsewhere The head and thorax samples of mosquitoes in positive abdomen pools were screened in- dividually by using the same rRT-PCR assay to deter- mine the extact location of virus transmission.SYBR green-based real time RT-PCR assayOne-step rRT-PCR assay was carried out using Quanti- Tect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit Qiagen Hilden Germany in a 20 ml reaction consisting of 5 ml of ex- tracted ZIKV RNA and 1 ml of each primer mix Table in a LightCyclerr 2.0 Roche Diagnostics GmbH Mann- heim Germany machine.

Longer amplicon sizes were preferred because of their suitability for sequencing to determine virus lineages.To determine the assay specificity in the presence of mosquito RNA the four different primer pairs ZIKV- F  R3 F  R4 F2  R3 and F3  R4 were first tested with RNA extracted from mosquito pools spiked with ZIKV Table and pools that were not spiked with ZIKV RNA Additional file Table S2.

The amplification efficiency and coefficient of determination R2 were calculated using Microsoft Excel Microsoft Redmond WA USA.Performance parameters of the assayThe specificity of the assay for ZIKV was determined by using RNA extracted from a panel of flaviviruses DENV-1 GenBank KM403575 DENV-2 GenBank KR779784 DENV-3 GenBank KR779787 DENV-4Table 2 Primer combinations evaluated during the assay developmentLife Technologies Carlsbad CA USA were added toeach elute to minimize RNA degradation.

days of propagation viral titres were quantified by using the plaque assay performed on BHK-21 cells as de- scribed elsewhere .Extraction of viral RNA and mosquito-derived RNAViral RNA was extracted from known titres of viral stocks by using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit Qiagen Hilden Germany according to manufacturer's instruc- tions.

These ZIKV-positive mosquitoes were collected as part of the vector surveillance activitiesTable 3 Comparison of the sensitivity of ZIKV detection between a probe-based rRT-PCR assay and the SYBR Green-based assay uti- lising the primer combination F2  R3aThe assay protocol has previously been described by Lanciotti et al.

Many of them generated non- specific background noise that was difficult to be differen- tiated from a true signal in the SYBR Green assay format.Table 4 Evaluation of SYBR Green-based rRT-PCR assay performance in ZIKV infected field caught mosquitoes confirmed by a probe-based rRT-PCR assayAbbreviations Cq quantification cycle Tm melting temperatureaThe assay protocol has previously been described by Lanciotti et al.

The whole genome sequence of the chikungunya virus isolate used in the assay evaluation was deposited in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information NCBI database under the accession number KY883764.Authors' contributionsHCH conceptualised and coordinated the assay design.

Our findings therefore support the potential use of newly-developed assay for the screening of field-caught mosquitoes as part of ZIKV surveillance programmes in endemic regions.AbbreviationsDENV Dengue virus PFU Plaque forming units rRT-PCR real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ZIKV Zika virusAcknowledgementsWe thank colleagues at Environmental Health Institute especially Dr. Li-Kiang Tan for providing virus stocks and Applied Entomology team for coordinat- ing the field collection of mosquitoes and laboratory investigations.FundingThis study was supported by the National Environmental Agency Singapore.
