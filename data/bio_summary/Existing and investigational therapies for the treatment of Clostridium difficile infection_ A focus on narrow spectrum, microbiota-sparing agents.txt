in a long-term care facility or other healthcare setting.several post hoc analyses of subgroups using the combined phase iii study data as well as newly acquired data from separate populations have been performed.a meta-analysis of combined data for 1164 patients in an intention-to-treat analysis showed that fidaxomicin reduced persistent diarrhea recurrence or death by 40  95 ci 26 -51  p  0.0001 during up to 40 days of follow-uppatients who received concomitant antibiotics 27.5  of patients enrolled in the two studies had a lower cure rate 84.4  vs. 92.6  p  0.001 and an extended time to resolution of diarrhea 97 vs. 54 hours p  0.001 than those who did not furthermore amongst patients receiving at least one con- comitant antibiotic the cure rate was 90.0  for fidaxomicin and 79.4  for vancomycin p  0.04 and the recurrence rate was 16.9  vs. 29.2  p  0.048 respectively treatment of first recurrence with fidaxomicin has also been assessed amongst 128 patients who had an episode of cdi in the preceding three-month period patients treated with fidaxomicin were significantly less likely to experience a fur- ther recurrence than those treated with vancomycin 19.7  vs.35.5  respectively p  0.045 analysis of a patient sub-population presenting with cancer demonstrated superior cure rate sustained response and a faster time to resolution of diarrhea in patients treated with fidaxomicin compared with those treated with vancomycin a sub-population of patients treated in one of the phase iii randomized controlled trials of fidaxomicin was found to have less risk of acquiring vancomycin-resistant entero- cocci vre than those treated with vancomycin 7  vs. 31  p  0.001 which may have important infection control implications alternative dosing schedulesa recent multicenter randomized open label study compared vancomycin 125 mg four times daily with an extended-pulsed regimen of fidaxomicin this consisted of 'normal dos- ing' of 200 mg twice a day for five days followed by alternate day dosing on days 7-25. this results in the same cumula- tive dose of fidaxomicin being administered over an elongated period of time.

the overall incidence and type of treatment-related adverse effects reported are similar to those seen with oral vancomycin rarely hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in the literature with facial tongue or throat swelling as the most com- monly reported symptoms which resolved after discontinuation clinical efficacytwo identical phase iii multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials of fidaxomicin vs. oral vancomycin were reported in 2011 and 2012 the first multicenter double-blind trial of a 10-day course of fidaxomicin vs. vancomycin 125 mg four times daily was conducted in north america and enrolled a total of 629 adult patients presenting with initial cdi or those with a first recurrence the modified intention-to-treat mitt population com- prised 596 patients receiving at least one dose of fidaxomicin.

however in the severe infection group the cure rates were 76  for metronidazole and 97  for vancomycin p  0.02 this finding has led to the recommendation to use van- comycin in patients presenting with severe infection in a number of international guidelines however there is additional and often overlooked evi- dence from a large phase iii multicenter randomized controlled trial of tolevamer a toxin-binding agent metronidazole and vancomycin which showed vancomycin to be superior to metronidazole for clinical success defined as resolution of diar- rhea and absence of severe abdominal discomfort due to cdi for more than two consecutive days including day 10 table 1relative characteristics of currently available drugs used to treat clostridium difficile infection.caracteristiques des traitements actuellement disponibles dans la prise en charge des infections a clostridium difficile.systemic absorptionachievable intraluminal concentrationsability to preserve normal microfloraefficacy clinical cureefficacy prevention of recurrencepotential for development of mutational resistancetolerability and safetycostideal druglowhighhighhighhighlowhighlow metronidazolehighlowmediummediummediumlowmediumamediumhighlow vancomycinlowhighmediumhighmediumlowhighmedium fidaxomicinlowhighhighhighhighlowhighhigha reports of increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations.this study included patients presenting with non-severe cdi and reported rates of clinical success of 72.7  and 81.1  for metronidazole and vancomycin respectively p  0.02 additional advantages of vancomycin compared with metronidazole include the ability to achieve high intraluminal concentrations with low levels of systemic absorption and sys- temic adverse effects following oral administration.

its mode of action is by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by blocking rna polymerase.fidaxomicin is inactive against gram-negative bacteria including bacteroides and enterobacteriaceae due to this narrow spectrum of activity and sparing of many of the predomi- nant bacteria comprising the normal fecal microflora it appears to limit intestinal dysbiosis when compared with vancomycin fidaxomicin exerts bactericidal activity against c. difficile and has a prolonged post antibiotic effect after removal of the drug compared with vancomycin it inhibits spore pro- duction and toxin production both in vitro and in vivo like vancomycin it is very poorly absorbed from the gastroin- testinal tract with negligible detectable plasma levels less than the lowest limit of detection of 5 ngml and is almost entirely excreted in feces intracolonic levels reach approximately 5000 times above the mic90 safety and tolerabilityas fidaxomicin is minimally absorbed from the intestinal tract there is generally limited opportunity for adverse effects in humans.

clinical cure rates were similar fidaxomicin being non- inferior to vancomycin with rates of approximately 88  and 86  for fidaxomicin and vancomycin respectively.

this also found fidaxomicin to be non-inferior to vancomycin for clinical cure but recurrence was significantly reduced in fidaxomicin- treated patients compared with vancomycin 12.7  vs. 26.9  p  0.0002 in the mitt group whole genome sequencing studies of the isolates obtained from patients entered into these two studies have shown that fidaxomicin protects against cdi recurrence both by reducing relapse of infection by the same strain and reinfection with a different strain this suggests additional benefits in those patients who might be at increased risk of re-exposure e.g.

clinical cure was significantly higher for patients receiving fidaxomicin monotherapy compared with fidaxomicin combination therapy 2529 86.2  patients vs. 1932 59.4  patients p  0.04. overall recurrence occurred in 6 13.6  of the 44 patients who achieved clinical cure another single center study performed in the united states involved patients who were eligible to receive fidaxomicin if they had a recurrent episode were aged 65 years or older required concomitant antibiotics were immunosuppressed or had labo- ratory markers of severity a total of 49 patients received fidaxomicin compared with 46 patients who received oral van- comycin.

significantly fewer patients were readmitted with cdi within 90 days in those receiving fidaxomicin compared with those receiving vancomycin 1049 20.4  vs. 1946 41.3  respectively p  0.027. this finding was observed even if those receiving fidaxomicin had more prior cdi episodes and were more likely to have moderate or severe cdi the largest multicenter real-world data study was conducted in seven nhs hospitals in england this study assessed outcomes associated with fidaxomicin use in 239 patients.

patients treated with fidaxomicin were less likely to contaminate their environment 2568 36.8  than patients treated with metronidazole andor vancomycin 3866 57.6  p  0.02. widespread use of fidaxomicin could help to limit both the over- all burden of cdi and colonization pressure in the healthcare environment.role in prophylaxisneither metronidazole nor vancomycin are recommended as prophylactic agents.

a small randomized placebo-controlled trial reported that prophylaxis with metronidazole was not effec- tive and that in patients who were administered oral vancomycin it resulted in a higher rate of carriage at two months a more recent retrospective cohort study using vancomycin as a prophylactic agent to prevent recurrent cdi in patients requir- ing systemic antimicrobials has been reported use of oral vancomycin prophylaxis resulted in a recurrence rate of 4.2  compared with 26.2  in the control group who did not receive any prophylaxis or 0.12 95 ci 0.04-0.4 p  0.001. afurther study of 551 cdi episodes treated with concomitant antibiotics reported a decreased risk of recurrence in patients receiving vancomycin prophylaxis compared with those who did not the concept of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recur- rence or even initial infection in very high-risk patients is an attractive one.

however a recent randomized clinical trial comparing fidaxomicin n  301 with placebo n  299 for prevention of initial cdi in patients under- going hematopoietic stem cell transplant and who required fluoroquinolone prophylaxis found no evidence of a protective effect with 28.6  of patients given fidaxomicin developing cdi vs. 30.8  of patients given the placebo health and pharmacoeconomicsthe high acquisition cost of fidaxomicin when compared with metronidazole and vancomycin has led to reluctance to pre- scribe this agent widely despite the clinical evidence to support its effectiveness.

it works by inhibiting protein synthesis and is bactericidal it also inhibits sporulation and toxin production its spectrum of activity is directed against gram-positive bacteria with limited impact on the gut flora other than bifidobacteria there is a very low propensity for development of resistance to cadazolid and mechanisms of resistance appear to be different from that of linezolid similar to fidaxomicin and vancomycin cadazolid is mini- mally absorbed and appears to be well tolerated with low plasma concentrations in a phase ii randomized double-bind trial a total of 84 patients presenting with a first episode or first recurrence were randomized to receive oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily or one of three dosing regimens of cadazolid 250 500 or 1000 mg twice daily for 10 days all three dosing regimens resulted in lower recurrence rates than vancomycin 18.2  25  22.2  and 50  respectively.

rates of recurrence measured at days 40 55 and 90 following the end of therapy were also lower for this novel dosing regimen 19  for vancomycin compared with 6.2  forextended-pulsed fidaxomicin at 90 days after the end of therapyp  0.001 real-world dataa number of post-marketing observational studies have described the use of fidaxomicin in clinical practice in a variety of settings.vargo et al.

this is in agreement with the views of other authors who have reported that fidaxomicin is less effec- tive for multiply relapsed patients presumably those with themost severely deranged microflora and should therefore be used early in the course of cdi rather than in late recurrent disease others have reported positive real-world data from a number of patient sub-populations such as those in the intensive care unit icu and solid organ transplant patients role in environmental contamination and spreadprobably related to its bactericidal and sporicidal properties an additional benefit to using fidaxomicin appears to be its asso- ciation with a reduced contamination rate into the healthcare environment a before and after study in a hospital that introduced fidaxomicin for first-line treatment of all cdis was conducted to assess rates of environmental contamination with spores of c. difficile.
