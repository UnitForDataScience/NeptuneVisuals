Sporadic CRC develops through the CIS chromosomal instability pathway while HNPCC hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer and CRC in FAP familial adenomatous polyposis develop along the MIS microsatellite instability pathway and from a germline mutation in the APC adenomatous polyposis coli gene respectively - both leading to invasive cancer at younger ages.12 More recently an additional pathway- the serrated pathway - displaying both MIS and non-MIS tumors has been defined.3 4The molecular biology of colorectal carcinogenesis is mapped in great detail with the majority of CRC demonstrating accumulation of mutations and epigenetic changes according to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence with loss of function of tumour suppressor genes and gain of function inoncogenes.5However pathways used by pathogens to establish infections quorum sensing invasion biofilm formation are able to derail mechanisms controlling cellular proliferation and pre-clinical and clinical research are producing mounting evidence that the gut microbiota is strongly associated with CRC carcinogenesis.

New biofilm inhibitors may change the course for CRC the same way antibiotics did for Helicobacter Pylori and gastric cancer.Probiotics and their SCFA seem to be a safe tool in conjunction with conventional treatment of CRC and already one clinical trial has demonstrated beneficial effects of probiotics for CRC patients including shorter hospital stay and lower infection rate.89A fecal or microbiota transplant MT to restore a healthy microbiota is an interesting concept in CRC but has still not been elucidated in CRC.

In addition prebiotics probiotics and microbiota transplantation may restore microbial homeostasis reduce the toxic effects of certain microbes inflammation mitogenic and antiapoptotic pathways and even antibiotics may contribute to the efficacy of chemotherapeutics in cancer patients.Lastly new classes of antibiotics like quorum sensing inhibitors and biofilm inhibitors may also become prominent tools in terms of changing the virulence and resistance of certain bacterial drivers and the course of bacterial driven carcinogenesis.AbbreviationsAOM azoxymethane APC adenomatous polyposis coli AREG amphiregulin BA bile acids BF bacteroides fragilis CDT cytolethal distending toxin CIS chromosomal instability CRC colorectal cancer DOC deoxycholic acid DSS dextran sodium sulphate EREG epiregulin ETBF Enterotoxic bacteroides fragilis ETBFT Enterotoxic bacteroides fragilis toxin FAP familial adenomatous polyposis FISH fluorescence in situ hybridization FOBT fecal occult blood test FN fusobacterium nucleatum HNPCC Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer IBD inflammatory bowel disease IBS irritable bowel syndromeILinterleukinMAMP microorganism-associated molecular pattern MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase MIS microsatellite instability MMR mismatch repair NF-kB nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells NLR NOD-like receptor NOC N-nitroso compoundsNODnucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor NSAID non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs PAMP pathogen-associated molecular pattern PBA primary bile acids PM porphyromonas PRR pattern recognition receptor RNS reactive nitrogen species ROS reactive oxygen species SBA secondary bileacids SCFA short chain fatty acids STAT3 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 TGF transforming growth factor Th cells T helper cells TIGIT T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs TLR toll-like receptor TNF tumor necrosis factor UC ulcerative colitis VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor Wnt wingless-related integration site.Competing InterestsThe authors have declared that no competing interest exists.ReferencesCarethers JM Stoffel EM.

Due to Western influences on lifestyle and diet CRC rates are on the rise in many Eastern nations as well and the global burden of CRC is estimated increase by 60 with 2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths annually by 2030.28 Although the 5-year survival rate has improved in the US from 50  to 65  over the last 40 years CRC remains a heavy burden on health care economics.

In the future targeting the microbiota will probably be a powerful weapon in the battle against CRC as gut microbiology genomics and metabolomics promise to uncover important linkages between microbiota and intestinal health.Key words microbiota dysbiosis mucosal defense mechanisms inflammation carcinogenesis colorectal cancer.IntroductionThe general understanding of CRC colorectal cancer is that it is basically a genetic disease resulting from a sequence of mutations following well-established molecular pathways and accumulating over many years.

Methods materials and results are inconsistent but a reproducible pattern in most studies show a reduction in lactic acid bacteria and an increase in fusobacteria staphylococcaceae and porphyromonadaceae.Fusobacteriaand porphyromonadaceae are known to synergistically promote oral cancer.81The microbiota located in close relation to tumor tissue and polyps did not differ significantly from the normal mucosa within the same individualsuggesting that the microbiota in CRC patients had not changed secondary to the neoplasia per se suggesting that a CRC distinctive microbiota was already present in early stages of carcinogenesis.14 36In general studies were based on small sample numbers and controls were often not comparable and at this point in time it is not possible to characterize a specific cancer associated gut microbiome.

In experimental settings limiting Th17 by depletion of Tregs reduces formation of microadenoma.75 91 106-109 On the other hand tumours with marked infiltration of CD3 and maybe of CD8 are reported to be associated with good clinical outcome in CRC in terms of longer disease-free survival and overall survival.110IL-6 is a powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine clearly associated to CRC development and important for angiogenesis in cancer tissue.

Dysbiosis may also contribute to extra-intestinal systemic conditionssuch as atherosclerosis obesity type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome and mental perturbations.Only recently the microbiota was integrated in the framework of translational CRC research and it seems clear that dysbiosis and subsequent immunological responses facilitate CRC carcinogenesis and is linked to prognosis as well.8-15 Although the microbiota is stable over long periods of time a variety of factors such as aging obesity western diet lack of exercise diseases and antibiotics shifts the microbiota towards a less diverse and pro-inflammatory profile.16Potential bacterial drivers and carcinogenic metabolites intraluminal events and inflammatory pathways are subject to intense research15 17-19 as manipulation of the microbiota e.g.

Patients with left-sided primary CRC had a median overall survival 33.3 months compared to 19.4 months for right-sided primary CRC.

More than 90  of CRC are sporadic with only a small number caused by germline mutations.CRC in FAP is a rare malignancy 1 of CRC caused by a frameshift mutation in the APC gene on chromsome 5q22.
