These results indicate that supplementation of HFD with PSC fractions can improve glycemia and may have a protective role against HFD-induced alterations in gut microbiota and mucus layer.Keywords glucose tolerance gut microbiome mucins pea fiber short chain fatty acidsIntroductionType 2 diabetes T2D is the most common form of diabetes mellitus and accounts for 90-95 of 422 million cases of diabetes worldwide highlighting the importance of prevention and management of this disease.

We also recognize that gene expression analysis of tight junction proteins is not conclusive without considering the importance of their structure and distribution which could be modified independently from the abundance of their proteins.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that inclusion of raw and cooked PSC fractions in diets of glucose intolerant rats alters the composition of gut microbiota while CP also improves glucose tolerance.

Cooked PSC improved glucose tolerance by approximately 30 p  0.05 and raw and cooked PSC diets reduced insulin response by 53 and 56 respectively p  0.05 and p  0.01 compared to HFD containing cellulose as the source of dietary fiber.

Cont.1 Unclassified Family or Order 2 Unclassified Order and Family of Phylum 3 As a percentage of total bacteria as determined by qPCR  Significant difference compared with HFD p  0.05  Significant difference compared with LFD p  0.05 n  6-8.Gene Expression of TLR Tight Junction Proteins and MucinsFollowing four weeks of feeding experimental diets ileal expression of TLR2 showed a pattern of elevated expression in HFD relative to other treatments Figure a p  0.09.

Considering the potential of peas to alter gut microbiota due to their fermentable dietary fiber content the primary objective of the present study was to elucidate the effects of feeding glucose intolerant rats raw and cooked PSC fractions on glycemia and the microbial composition of the gut.

In this study we investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with raw and cooked pea seed coats PSC on glucose tolerance microbial composition of the gut select markers of intestinal barrier function and short chain fatty acid profile in glucose intolerant rats.

Our findings suggest a potential protective role for PSC fractions against HFD-induced alterations in the microbial composition of the gut and elements of gut barrier function.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at  Supplementary Table S1.

CP group showed increased expression of Muc2 and Muc4 genes when compared to HFD group  p  0.05.SCFA in Serum and Fecal SamplesSerum levels of SCFA acetate and propionate varied significantly between the groups Figure a p  0.05 and p  0.01 respectively RP had significantly higher levels of acetate and propionate compared to HFD while LFD showed a significant increase in propionate.

In mice HFD feeding is associated with changes in the oligosaccharide chains of mucins and consequently their altered composition  and HFD decreases expression of duodenal Muc2 .

In our study we observed no difference in the abundance of Firmicutes and a significant reduction in the proportion of Bacteroidetes in CP compared to HFD whereas RP displayed a similar non-significant pattern.We also examined the effect of PSC diets on the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in the ileum.
