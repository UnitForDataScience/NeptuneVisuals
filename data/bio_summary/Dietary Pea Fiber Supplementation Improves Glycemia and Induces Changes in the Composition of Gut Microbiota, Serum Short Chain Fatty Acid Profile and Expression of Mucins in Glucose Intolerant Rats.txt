after four weeks of psc supplementation muc1 muc2 and muc4 mrna expression levels differed between the diet groups p  0.05. in particular cp rats showed elevated expression of muc2 and muc4 mrna compared to the hfd group p  0.05. no significant differences were observed in the ileal expression of muc3 figure c.bileal tlr2ileal tlr42.0091.51.51.01.00.50.50.00.0cdileal occludin32.0ileal zo-11.521.010.500.0figure 3. mrna expression of tlrs and tight junction proteins.

this was accompanied by increased mrna expression of mucin genes muc1 muc2 and muc4 in ileal epithelium p  0.05. serum levels of acetate and propionate increased with raw psc diet p  0.01. these results indicate that supplementation of hfd with psc fractions can improve glycemia and may have a protective role against hfd-induced alterations in gut microbiota and mucus layer.keywords glucose tolerance gut microbiome mucins pea fiber short chain fatty acidsintroductiontype 2 diabetes t2d is the most common form of diabetes mellitus and accounts for 90-95 of 422 million cases of diabetes worldwide highlighting the importance of prevention and management of this disease.

gene expression data was normalized to gapdh as the house-keeping gene and presented as means - sem n  6-8. there was a significant effect of treatment for relative expression of muc1 muc2 and muc4 p  0.05. cp group showed increased expression of muc2 and muc4 genes when compared to hfd group  p  0.05.scfa in serum and fecal samplesserum levels of scfa acetate and propionate varied significantly between the groups figure a p  0.05 and p  0.01 respectively rp had significantly higher levels of acetate and propionate compared to hfd while lfd showed a significant increase in propionate.

we also recognize that gene expression analysis of tight junction proteins is not conclusive without considering the importance of their structure and distribution which could be modified independently from the abundance of their proteins.conclusionsthe present study demonstrates that inclusion of raw and cooked psc fractions in diets of glucose intolerant rats alters the composition of gut microbiota while cp also improves glucose tolerance.

grouping of microbial composition by dietary treatment is reflected in the principal coordinate analysis pcoa plot in figure a. the cp and rp treatments distinctly clustered separately from both hfd and lfd treatment groups anosim p  0.05 whereas the two psc treatments did not differ from each other p  0.179. there was an increase in diversity in response to both rp and cp fractions versus hfd and lfd as indicated by inverse simpson diversity index figure b p  0.05 and p  0.01 respectively.at the phylum level there was an overall decrease in the proportion of bacteroidetes p  0.05 in cp as compared to hfd table .

this is the only bacterial family that was affected by psc the same as lfd with all three groups showing significantly lower abundance compared to hfd p  0.05. acidaminococcaceae on the other hand was significantly decreased in hfd compared to lfd p  0.05 however this family was not detected in either of the psc groups.

cooked psc improved glucose tolerance by approximately 30 p  0.05 and raw and cooked psc diets reduced insulin response by 53 and 56 respectively p  0.05 and p  0.01 compared to hfd containing cellulose as the source of dietary fiber.

asterisks show significant difference compared to hfd  p  0.01  p  0.05. fecal scfas concentrations were not statistically different between groups.discussionthe present study evaluated the effects of psc feeding on glycemia the composition of gut microbiota select markers of intestinal barrier function and scfa profile in hfd-induced glucose intolerant rats.

in mice hfd feeding is associated with changes in the oligosaccharide chains of mucins and consequently their altered composition  and hfd decreases expression of duodenal muc2 .

expression of mucin genes in the ileum was significantly influenced by cp which had higher expression of muc2 and muc4 compared to hfd.

in our study we observed no difference in the abundance of firmicutes and a significant reduction in the proportion of bacteroidetes in cp compared to hfd whereas rp displayed a similar non-significant pattern.we also examined the effect of psc diets on the expression of tlr2 and tlr4 in the ileum.

in this study we investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with raw and cooked pea seed coats psc on glucose tolerance microbial composition of the gut select markers of intestinal barrier function and short chain fatty acid profile in glucose intolerant rats.

in turn disruption of intestinal barrier function plays a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases including diabetes obesity and multiple gastrointestinal disorders -.we previously showed that the inclusion of raw pea seed coats psc in the diets of glucose intolerant rats resulted in improved glucose homeostasis however we did not examine the effect of cooking as the relevant form of preparation on these outcomes .
