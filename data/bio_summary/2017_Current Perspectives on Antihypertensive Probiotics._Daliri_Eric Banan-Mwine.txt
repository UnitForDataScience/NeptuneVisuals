The potential of recombinant antihypertensive probiotics to reduce BP has also been discussed.Probiotics Hypercholesterolemia and HypertensionThere is a large pool of evidence to show that high BP and high total cholesterol are linked -.

In fact a positive cross- sectional relation has been found between dietary cholesterol intake and systolic BP SBP as well as diastolic BP DBP .

Since reduction in total and low-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol reduce BP   the administration of cholesterol- lowering probiotics may be effective in protecting against or reducing high BP.

More studies are required to ascertain the possible safety concerns that may arise from consuming re- combinant probiotics before they can be used in human studies.ConclusionThe evidence that high BP is associated with gut dysbiosis makes it important to establish the ability of probiotics to reduce high BP in humans.

CholesterolIntroductionHypertension high blood pressure is an important disease characterized by a sustained systolic blood pressure BP val- ue of 140 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg 14090 in young persons.

Meanwhile BP increases with age and hence only elderly people 60 years with BPs above 15090 mmHg may require treatment .

Many obese persons have high BP.

In obesity the increased visceral adiposity may physically compress the kidneys leading to impaired renal- pressure natriuresis and high BP .

Therefore control of BP in obesity requires that the body mass index is first reduced  .

Common treatment regimens are aimed at reducing BP which eventually reduces the associated risks .
