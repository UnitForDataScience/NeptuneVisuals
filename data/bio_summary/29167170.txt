Effect of canagliflozin on plasma levels of uremic toxinsA Plasma levels of microbiota-derived uremic toxins p-cresyl sulfate indoxyl sulfateand trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO.B Plasma levels of micorobiota-independent uremic toxins Asymmetricdimethylarginine ADMA symmetric dimethylarginine SDMA andguanidinosuccinic acid GSA.

Because the modulation of theintestinal environment reduces the production of microbiota-derived uremic toxins wesupposed that canagliflozin may influence the levels of retained uremic toxins in CKD.5Here we examined the effects of canagliflozin on accumulated uremic toxinsusing CKD model mice.

These results indicate that canagliflozin treatment did not significantlyaffect the damage or impaired function observed in the RF mice.Effect of canagliflozin on plasma uremic toxinsTo examine whether canagliflozin affects the accumulation of uremic toxins wemeasured the plasma levels of six representative uremic toxins PCS IS TMAOADMA SDMA and GSA by LC-MSMS 43-45 Figure 4A and 4B.

However canagliflozin treatment did not show asignificant increase in the urinary levels suggesting that the reducing effect ofcanagliflozin on the plasma levels was not mainly attributed to the promotion of urinaryexcretion of PCS and IS.Intestinal effects of canagliflozin on SCFA productionTo examine the intestinal effects of canagliflozin we analyzed the levels of organicacids including SCFAs in the cecal contents of RFvehicle and RFCana group mice.Canagliflozin treatment significantly increased levels of the cecal SCFAs acetatebutyrate and propionate in the RF mice Figure 6A.

Thus reducing the levels of retained uremic toxins is an importanttherapeutic target in CKD 24 53.The intestinal environment including the microbiota play a key role in theaccumulation of uremic toxins.

Canagliflozin treatment in the RF mice markedlyreduced the elevated plasma PCS levels 75 reduction compared with the vehiclegroup 9.3-1.7 and 2.3-1.6 uM in the RFvehicle and RFCana groups respectively.Plasma IS levels were 5.2-fold higher in the RFvehicle group than in the normal group.The elevated plasma IS levels were also significantly reduced by canagliflozin 26reduction compared with the vehicle group 86.8-1.7 and 64.7-1.6 uM in theRFvehicle and RFCana groups respectively.

Since high PCS levels are associated with anincreased risk of end-stage renal disease as well as that of cardiovascular diseases 2659 the reducing effect of uremic toxin might play a partial role in the renoprotectiveeffect of canagliflozin.Our findings suggest that the intestinal effect of canagliflozin in the reductionof plasma uremic toxins was achieved via SGLT1 inhibition.

In the presentstudy the levels of the microbiota-independent uremic toxins ADMA SDMA and GSAwere significantly although not strongly reduced suggesting that SGLT2 inhibition bycanagliflozin treatment may be involved in reducing plasma uremic toxins.

Because various uremic solutes are derived from proteinfermentation by colonic microbiota the gut microbial status affects the plasma levels ofuremic toxins 30.
