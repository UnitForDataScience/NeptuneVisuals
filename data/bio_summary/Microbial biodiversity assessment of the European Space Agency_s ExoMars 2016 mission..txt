Only a few microorganisms were retrieved from heat- shocked samples taken from spacecraft hardware.Overall cultivable diversity decreased during AIT activities The biodiversity assays aimed at the cultivation of a broader diversity of microorganisms from the clean- room facility including oligotrophs alkaliphiles vegeta- tives fungi and anaerobes  The highest median CFU counts were observed for vegetative microorganisms which remained detectable also during the last sampling event Additional file Table S4 Fig.

The Schiaparelli lander was subject to strict requirements for microbial cleanliness according to the obligatory planetary protection policy.

The studied cleanrooms and change room were occupied by very distinct microbial communities Overall the change room harboured a higher number and diversity of microorganismsincluding Propionibacterium which was found to be significantly increased in the change room.

The reports on numerous habitable planets have fuelled the speculations and hopes for the existence of extra-terrestrial life  NASA Exoplanet Archive However these potentially life-bearing planets are far beyond human's reach--except Mars where the special regions pro- vide conditions in terms of temperature and water activity that would allow the propagation of terrestrial life on Mars today No Martian life forms are yet known but the observa- tion of gaseous methane outbreaks in the Martian atmos- phere has raised tremendous interest.

The number and diversity of microorganisms in close vicinity of a spacecraft during AIT assembly integration and test activities are dependent on a variety of factors such as cleanroom class and architecture the clothing and behav- iour of personnel and the cleaning and disinfection proto- col of the facility -.Modern spacecraft carry extremely sensitive equipment and instruments and therefore cannot be easily sterilised as a whole after assembly.

The first mission of the program arrived at Mars in October 2016 and consisted of two parts the Trace Gas Orbiter TGOand an entry descent and landing demonstrator module Schiaparelli.

The instruments were intended to study the water and geochemical setting and measure and map methane.
