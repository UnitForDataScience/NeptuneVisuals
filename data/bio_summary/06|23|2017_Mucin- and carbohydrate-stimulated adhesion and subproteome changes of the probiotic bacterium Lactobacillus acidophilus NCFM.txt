The fact that adhesion of L. acidophilus NCFM to mucin was unaltered when mucin was present during growth may stem from that mucin glycoproteins in the culture medium bind di- rectly to the bacterial surface thereby preventing subsequent bacterial adhesion to the mucin layer as found previously in case of Lactobacillus reuteri strains .Although L. acidophilus NCFM does not utilize mucin as carbon source  growth increased significantly when glucose was supple- mented with mucin Fig.

The latter two proteins were however found to decrease in abundance by mucin-supplemented growth of L. acidophilus NCFM in the present study thus we so far only identified coherence with previous studies in the expression and cell adhesive abilities for PK and fructose- bisphosphate aldolase.Comparing whole-cell and surface proteomes of L. acidophilus NCFM grown on cellobiose identified that phosphate starvation induc- ible protein stress-related and GAPDH underwent similar abundance changes - increased and decreased respectively.

Contrarily trehalose and mucin in combination with glucoseenhanced growth of L. acidophilus NCFM by 1.4- and 1.5-fold respectively.Bacterial adhesion to mucin and HT-29 cellsBacteria grown on cellobiose and polydextrose showed 4.1- and 5.2- fold p  0.05 and 2.6- and 2.3-fold p  0.05 greater adhesion to coat- ed mucin and HT-29 cells than control glucose grown bacteria  respectively.

Similarly for cellobiose despite a slow growth adhesion was stimulated which strongly supports the recently suggested use of cellobiose and L. acidophilus NCFM as synbiotic .The bacterial surface layer is exposed to the external environment.Therefore modification of the surface-associated protein profile in re- sponse to environmental changes can potentially reflect the effect of ex- ternal factors on the bacteria.

Among the most abundant proteins of the surface prote- ome of cellobiose-grown L. acidophilus NCFM EF-G is a moonlighting protein found as well on the surface or in exoproteomes of other bacteria and affording binding to fibrinogen collagen and mucin .

The ability of mucin to adsorb to polystyrene sur- faces has enabled in vitro adhesion studies of probiotic commensal and pathogenic bacteria .Since bacteria in the GIT are exposed to mucin supplementing L. ac- idophilus NCFM cultures with mucin can be hypothesized to enhance adhesion.

Molecular events connected with ad- hesion and surface proteome changes were investigated for the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM cultured with established or emerging prebiotic carbohydrates as carbon source and in the presence of mucin the glyco- protein of the epithelial mucus layer.
