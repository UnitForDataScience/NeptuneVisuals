Specifically although confamilial caterpillars in Costa Rica had marginally more similar gut bacterial assemblages than did caterpillars in different families PERMANOVA pseudo-F643  1.47 P  0.053 they had also been feeding on plants with especially similar leaf microbiomes PERMANOVA pseudo-F642  1.73 P  0.005.Supporting our claim that caterpillars lack resident gut microbiomes we show experimentally that the growth and sur- vival of field-collected M. sexta caterpillars are not dependent on gut bacterial activity.

This pattern is more likely a function of plant DNA degradation during intestinal transit than of bacterial proliferation as bacterial density remained similar or decreased slightly from midgut to feces depending on the caterpillar spe- cies SI Appendix Fig.

Indeed microscopy-based studies report no or minimal microbial growth in caterpillar guts 20-22.DNA- and culture-based investigations of caterpillar gut micro- biomes have produced mixed findings with conflicting implica- tions for microbial involvement in caterpillar biology.

While microbes were known to cause disease in caterpillars as early as Louis Pasteur's experiments on silkworms 35 their potential importance as mutualists remains unclear.Do caterpillars depend on gut microbes for feeding and de- velopment To answer this question we first characterized gut microbial abundance and composition across a taxonomically and geographically broad array of wild caterpillars SI Appendix Fig.

Additionally even normally transient gut microbes can neg- atively affect caterpillars under certain circumstances such as after ingestion of insecticidal toxins 61 and thus may be important to understanding caterpillar herbivory and pest management.The lack of a resident gut microbiome in caterpillars may di- rectly result from a digestive physiology that is unfavorable to microbial growth 18.

In other words cat- erpillars consuming leaves with more distinct bacterial assem- blages had more distinct bacterial assemblages in their feces as would be expected if gut microbes are diet-derived and only transiently present.

Feces of the herbivorous goose Branta bernicla had low bacterial loads and a high proportion of plant DNA and the insectivorous bat Myotis lucifugus had similarly low fecal bacterial loads SI Appendix Table S1.
