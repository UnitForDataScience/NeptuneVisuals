to assess potential alterations in the neuro-inflammatory state and reactive gliosis we analysed ab plaque-localisedfigure 4. plaque-localised glial reactivity is reduced in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice.representative x60 magnification z-stack maximum projection images of iba-1ve ab plaque-localised microglia co-stained with dapi in vehicle and 1 wk abx gvg-treated 6.5-month-old appsweps1de9 mice.quantification of plaque-localised iba-1ve microglial number in vehicle and 1 wk abx gvg-treated appswe ps1de9 mice n  12 p 0.05 unpaired two-tailed student's t-test.

these findings suggest that blood-circulating and csf-residing inflammatory mediator levels are differentially altered in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice and support the notion that developmental perturbations in microbial diversity may have long-term conse- quences for host innate immune responses.we further stratified vehicle and 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice based on low or high amyloid burden determined by ab stereology using an anti-ab mab 3d6 see fig.

these findings imply that reduction of amyloid plaque burden observed in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice is not the result of alterations in app proteolysis or b-secretase levels.plaque-localised glial reactivity is reduced in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice.

considering scf is one inflammatory entity that is differentially expressed in the serum and csf of 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice further compartmental-based investigations are required to elucidate the impact of these altered inflammatory profiles on neuro-inflammation and amyloidosis.we were particularly intrigued by the observation that serum levels of ccl11 are elevated in the serum of 1 wk abx gvg-treated animals a finding consistent with our earlier studies in appsweps1de9 mice subjected to life-long abx selection.

relative abundance analysis of three sig- nificantly altered bacterial classes at the genus level revealed significant expansion of lachnospiraceae vehicle 18.09 - 1.76 vs. 1 wk abx gvg 41.84 - 3.53 vs. abx 33.07 - 2.30 n  10-12 p  0.001 reduction ofs24-7 vehicle 27.51 - 1.64 vs. 1 wk abx gvg 15.70 - 3.79 vs. abx 9.42 - 3.33 n  10-12 p  0.05 andexpansion of akkermansia vehicle 0.02 - 0.002 vs. 1 wk abx gvg 0.19 - 0.066 vs. abx 16.51 - 2.31 vs.n  10-12 p 0.001 between both abx treatment regimens and vehicle controls fig.

using this index we observed a non-statistically significant decrease in microbial a-diversity in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice compared to vehicle controls and this was not as prominent as previously observed in the abx group vehicle 6.94 - 0.28 vs. 1 wk abx gvg 5.78 - 0.38 vs. abx 4.75 - 0.87 p  0.05 n  10-12 fig.

these studies revealed a significant 1.79-fold decrease in combined cortical and hippocampal ab plaque burden in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice compared with age matched vehicle controls vehicle 1.00 - 0.14 vs. 1 wk abx gvg 0.58 - 0.09 p  0.017 n  12 fig.

high powerx 60 magnification z-stack images of these ab plaques also revealed a significant 2.22-fold decrease in the size of individual deposits in 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice compared to vehicle controls vehicle 783.2 - 47.74 um2 vs. 1 wk abx gvg 352.4 - 46.20 um2 n  12 4 plaques per mouse p 0.011 fig.

.in view of our demonstration that 1 wk abx gvg-treated appsweps1de9 mice showed diminished amyloid burden compared with vehicle-treated animals we considered the possibility that our findings might be the result of decreased transgene or app-cleavage enzyme expression in the brains of the 1 wk abx gvg-treated appswe ps1de9 mice.
