Plaque-localised glial reactivity is reduced in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice.Representative x60 magnification z-stack maximum projection images of IBA-1ve Ab plaque-localised microglia co-stained with DAPI in vehicle and 1 wk ABX gvg-treated 6.5-month-old APPSWEPS1DE9 mice.Quantification of plaque-localised IBA-1ve microglial number in vehicle and 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWE PS1DE9 mice n  12 p 0.05 unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test.

These findings suggest that blood-circulating and CSF-residing inflammatory mediator levels are differentially altered in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice and support the notion that developmental perturbations in microbial diversity may have long-term conse- quences for host innate immune responses.We further stratified vehicle and 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice based on low or high amyloid burden determined by Ab stereology using an anti-Ab mAb 3D6 see Fig.

These findings imply that reduction of amyloid plaque burden observed in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice is not the result of alterations in APP proteolysis or b-secretase levels.Plaque-localised glial reactivity is reduced in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice.

Considering SCF is one inflammatory entity that is differentially expressed in the serum and CSF of 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice further compartmental-based investigations are required to elucidate the impact of these altered inflammatory profiles on neuro-inflammation and amyloidosis.We were particularly intrigued by the observation that serum levels of CCL11 are elevated in the serum of 1 wk ABX gvg-treated animals a finding consistent with our earlier studies in APPSWEPS1DE9 mice subjected to life-long ABX selection.

Relative abundance analysis of three sig- nificantly altered bacterial classes at the genus level revealed significant expansion of Lachnospiraceae Vehicle 18.09 - 1.76 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg 41.84 - 3.53 vs. ABX 33.07 - 2.30 n  10-12 p  0.001 reduction ofS24-7 Vehicle 27.51 - 1.64 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg 15.70 - 3.79 vs. ABX 9.42 - 3.33 n  10-12 p  0.05 andexpansion of Akkermansia Vehicle 0.02 - 0.002 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg 0.19 - 0.066 vs. ABX 16.51 - 2.31 vs.n  10-12 p 0.001 between both ABX treatment regimens and vehicle controls Fig.

Using this index we observed a non-statistically significant decrease in microbial a-diversity in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice compared to vehicle controls and this was not as prominent as previously observed in the ABX group Vehicle 6.94 - 0.28 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg 5.78 - 0.38 vs. ABX 4.75 - 0.87 p  0.05 n  10-12 Fig.

In brain tissues of 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice we noted non-statistically significant decreases in Th2-like responses Vehicle GATA-3 2.46 - 1.54 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg GATA-3 0.62 - 0.62 n  5-6 Supp.

These studies revealed a significant 1.79-fold decrease in combined cortical and hippocampal Ab plaque burden in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice compared with age matched vehicle controls Vehicle 1.00 - 0.14 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg 0.58 - 0.09 p  0.017 n  12 Fig.

High powerx 60 magnification z-stack images of these Ab plaques also revealed a significant 2.22-fold decrease in the size of individual deposits in 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice compared to vehicle controls Vehicle 783.2 - 47.74 um2 vs. 1 wk ABX gvg 352.4 - 46.20 um2 n  12 4 plaques per mouse p 0.011 Fig.

.In view of our demonstration that 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWEPS1DE9 mice showed diminished amyloid burden compared with vehicle-treated animals we considered the possibility that our findings might be the result of decreased transgene or APP-cleavage enzyme expression in the brains of the 1 wk ABX gvg-treated APPSWE PS1DE9 mice.
