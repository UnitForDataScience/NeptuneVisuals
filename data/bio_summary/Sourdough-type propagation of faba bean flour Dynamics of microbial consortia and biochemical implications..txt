The flours used were obtained from two faba bean cultivars grown for food and feed uses V. faba major named broad bean including culti- vars with large flattened seeds popular in the southern regions of Europe and V. faba minor named field bean or horse bean includ- ing cultivars with medium to relatively small and round seeds  .As shown by PCoA which was based on the weighted UniFrac dis- tance matrix of the number of OTUs Ita and Fi flours and doughs before fermentation were contaminated by metabolically active bacteria most likely representing the outcome of milling procedure.The initial community of the two flours before fermentation was dominated by a metabolically active phylum which likely represented the outcome of environmental contamination.

The dynamics of the lactic acid bacteria community and the characteristics of the sourdough-types were monitored throughout 14 days of propagation in order to assess their potential use in bread making.Materials and methodsFaba bean floursSix batches of commercial Italian faba bean Ita Vicia faba major harvest year 2014 and six batches of Finnish faba bean Fi Vicia faba minor harvest year 2014 flours obtained from the stone-milling ofthe dehulled seeds by CerealVeneta mills San Martino di Lupari PD Italy were pooled on the basis of the country of origin and used in this study.

Moreover the residual hulls un- avoidably present in V. faba minor Finnish flour strongly affected the microbial diversity and the biochemical characteristics of the mature sourdough compared to the V. faba major Italian flour.Although further experimental approaches might clarify the mecha- nisms involved in lactic acid bacteria dominance in faba bean sour- dough the results here collected provide information useful for a proper selection of starters and the application of sourdough fermenta- tion recognized as an emerging and promising biotechnology for im- proving nutritional and functional features of faba bean flour.FundingThis research has been developed under the European Project BIOPROT - Novel multifunctional plant protein ingredients with bioprocessing FP7-ERA-Net - SUSFOOD.Fig.

Overall higher microbial di- versity was found in Fi than in Ita sourdough probably due to the higher microbial contamination related to the hulls surface even though the diversity markedly decreased with increasing propagation steps.The propagation conditions of faba bean sourdoughs chosen in thisstudy were similar to traditional protocols previously used for cereal and cereal-legumes sourdough fermentation  .

Before fermentation T0 both faba bean doughs contained a low cell density of yeasts  2.0 log CFUg which signifi- cantly P b 0.05 increased after the first 16 h of fermentation ca.3.7 - 0.3 log CFUg for Fi sourdough.

Recently lactic acid bacteria fermentation has been used in combined le- gume-wheat flour sourdough technology providing a large biodiversity to the sourdough microbiota and a better nutritional quality of the legume- wheat bread .In this study the flour obtained from two different faba bean varieties was used in traditional sourdough-type biotechnology employing the backslopping procedure.

Compared to Ita sourdough the concentration of lac- tic acid of Fi sourdough was almost 10 higher.Acetic acid was not detectable before the first fermentation  .

T0 corresponds to doughs before fermentation T1 to doughs after the first fermentation 30 degC for 16 h. After T1 refreshments were carried out daily by mixing 25 of the previously fermented dough with flour and water and incubating at 30 degC for 8 h. T2 T5 T7 and T14 correspond to the sourdoughs analyzed at 2 5 7 and 14 days of propagation.The data are the means of three independent experiments - standard deviations n  3. a-e values in the same row with different superscript letters differ significantly P b 0.05. nd not detected.Table 3 Oligosaccharides concentration in sourdoughs obtained from Italian Ita and Finnish Fi faba bean flours.
