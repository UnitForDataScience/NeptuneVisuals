the initial focus of skin microbiome research was centred on atopic eczema3334 given the prominent role of staphylococci in dis- ease pathogenesis but more recent efforts have focused on psoriasis as a useful model of chronic inflammatory disease.psoriasis pathophysiology the role of bacteriathe role of bacteria in particular streptococci as a potential trigger factor for psoriasis was reported over half a century ago3536 and led to the hypothesis that the disease itself was a t-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that is mediated by group a b-haemolytic streptococcal superantigen.37 moreover while streptococci are most readily associated with the guttate subtype of psoriasis recent evidence has suggested that strep- tococcal throat infections are also associated with exacerba- tions of chronic plaque psoriasis.38 streptococci have been isolated from the blood of patients with chronic plaque psori- asis and from those with guttate psoriasis albeit with varying frequency.39 indeed the role of tonsillectomy as a therapeutic intervention in psoriasis has recently been reviewed.40although the role of bacteria in general and streptococci inparticular in the pathogenesis of psoriasis remainsunexplained the association invites speculation that the disease is at least associated with changes in the composition of the microbiome.

in contrast grice et al.12 reported that proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in healthy skin although in a later study the reported abundance was reduced.22 nevertheless gao et al.51 found that proteobacteria were more readily detected in healthy skin compared with psoriasis plaques.4 microbiome in psoriasis e.a.

notwithstanding several methodologi- cal factors the relatively small numbers in the study the lack of stringent matching of patients with psoriasis to controls the diverse extent of the psoriasis involvement body surface area 5-20 and the varied duration of disease 1-24 years significant differences in the cutaneous microbiome between healthy subjects and patients with psoriasis were readily detectable.

specifically changes in the microbiome signature may be used to predict treatment response or even serve as a basis for treatment selection which is much needed at a time when the therapeutic armamentarium in psoriasis has rapidly expanded.can microbiome research reveal insights into the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseasebased on the largely descriptive studies of the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis future research should focus on translating these findings into developing an integrated model of the pathogenesis of psoriasis potentially unveiling new therapeutic targets.

moreover another interesting association between the microbiome and psoriasis has been suggested by fry et al.641 drawing on lessons learned from research in chronic inflam- matory bowel disease the authors propose that psoriasis may reflect an abnormal innate immune response e.g.

any dysregulation of this may conceivably contribute to the development of disease or altered wound healing.20 furthermore given the aforementioned association between group a b-haemolytic streptococci and psoriasis39 the increased prevalence of streptococci in psoriatic skin con- sistent with the original findings of gao et al.51 deserves fur- ther attention.utilizing microbiome data bringing sequencing into the clinicwith these at times seemingly divergent data at both the level of bacteria phyla and genera statnikov et al.57 sought tomove the field forward by determining the feasibility of iden- tifying the 'molecular signatures' of psoriasis.

while the authors concluded that the correla- tion between psoriasis severity and cutaneous microbial com- position was weak psoriasis status was a major source of variability in the microbial communities and two 'cutaneo- types' were identified.

owing to the lack of long-term follow-up and the bimodal peak of psoriasis inci- dence it is possible that some of these subjects may have developed psoriasis after the study had been performed.

more- over they also highlighted the difficulties in performing pso- riasis microbiome studies which included but were not limited to antibiotic use systemic and topical therapy family history of psoriasis psoriasis phenotype comorbidities in- cluding inflammatory bowel disease and psoriatic arthritis the selection of skin sites and the inclusion of both involved and uninvolved skin in a dynamic disease process.

biofilm formation and may also act as a potential autoantigen in psoriasis figs 2 and 3.60-62as it is recognized that treatments for psoriasis and otherimmune-mediated inflammatory diseases particularly inflam- matory bowel disease may target shared cytokine path- ways63 it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which microbiome research can reveal insights into the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease in general.

future studies combining sequencing and culture data may address this limitation.as part of the human microbiome project52 a smaller cohort that formed a longitudinal substudy by alekseyenko et al.53 sought to determine the extent to which changes in the cutaneous microbiome were associated with psoriasis and whether these were influenced by systemic treatment.

despite these limitations including the small sample size in the longitudinal substudy alek- seyenko et al.5357 confirmed the association between psoriasis and altered composition of the cutaneous microbiome.
