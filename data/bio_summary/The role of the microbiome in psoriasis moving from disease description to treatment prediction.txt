interleukin IL-23 IL-17 to the skin microbiome rather than being an autoimmune disease.641Psoriasis particularly severe disease may be associated withan increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease Crohn dis- ease and ulcerative colitis.4243 This association is supported by genetic evidence suggesting shared susceptibility loci.4445 More recently associations between Crohn disease and alter- ations in the gastrointestinal microbiome have been reported.46-48 Interestingly a reduction in Faecalibacterium praus- nitzii a member of the gastrointestinal Firmicutes phyla was associated with an increased risk of postoperative disease relapse.49 Decreased F. prausnitzii prevalence in stool has recently been reported in patients with psoriasis.50 This obser- vation supports the possibility that psoriasis is also associated with important shifts in the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome.To what extent is psoriasis associated with a dysregulated skin microbiomeTurning our attention to the skin itself the site of the charac- teristic plaques of psoriasis we can pose the question 'What evidence exists to demonstrate that the cutaneous microbiome is altered in psoriasis' One of the seminal studies that aimed to characterize the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis was per- formed by Gao et al.51 Drawing on results from an antecedent study in healthy skin21 the authors reported that plaques of psoriasis had the most diverse taxa with Firmicutes forming the most abundant phylum.

The initial focus of skin microbiome research was centred on atopic eczema3334 given the prominent role of staphylococci in dis- ease pathogenesis but more recent efforts have focused on psoriasis as a useful model of chronic inflammatory disease.Psoriasis pathophysiology the role of bacteriaThe role of bacteria in particular streptococci as a potential trigger factor for psoriasis was reported over half a century ago3536 and led to the hypothesis that the disease itself was a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that is mediated by group A b-haemolytic streptococcal superantigen.37 Moreover while streptococci are most readily associated with the guttate subtype of psoriasis recent evidence has suggested that strep- tococcal throat infections are also associated with exacerba- tions of chronic plaque psoriasis.38 Streptococci have been isolated from the blood of patients with chronic plaque psori- asis and from those with guttate psoriasis albeit with varying frequency.39 Indeed the role of tonsillectomy as a therapeutic intervention in psoriasis has recently been reviewed.40Although the role of bacteria in general and streptococci inparticular in the pathogenesis of psoriasis remainsunexplained the association invites speculation that the disease is at least associated with changes in the composition of the microbiome.

In contrast Grice et al.12 reported that Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in healthy skin although in a later study the reported abundance was reduced.22 Nevertheless Gao et al.51 found that Proteobacteria were more readily detected in healthy skin compared with psoriasis plaques.4 Microbiome in psoriasis E.A.

Any dysregulation of this may conceivably contribute to the development of disease or altered wound healing.20 Furthermore given the aforementioned association between group A b-haemolytic streptococci and psoriasis39 the increased prevalence of streptococci in psoriatic skin con- sistent with the original findings of Gao et al.51 deserves fur- ther attention.Utilizing microbiome data bringing sequencing into the clinicWith these at times seemingly divergent data at both the level of bacteria phyla and genera Statnikov et al.57 sought tomove the field forward by determining the feasibility of iden- tifying the 'molecular signatures' of psoriasis.

Moreover another interesting association between the microbiome and psoriasis has been suggested by Fry et al.641 Drawing on lessons learned from research in chronic inflam- matory bowel disease the authors propose that psoriasis may reflect an abnormal innate immune response e.g.

Notwithstanding several methodologi- cal factors the relatively small numbers in the study the lack of stringent matching of patients with psoriasis to controls the diverse extent of the psoriasis involvement body surface area 5-20 and the varied duration of disease 1-24 years significant differences in the cutaneous microbiome between healthy subjects and patients with psoriasis were readily detectable.

Specifically changes in the microbiome signature may be used to predict treatment response or even serve as a basis for treatment selection which is much needed at a time when the therapeutic armamentarium in psoriasis has rapidly expanded.Can microbiome research reveal insights into the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseaseBased on the largely descriptive studies of the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis future research should focus on translating these findings into developing an integrated model of the pathogenesis of psoriasis potentially unveiling new therapeutic targets.

Indeed these factors are crucial for both standardizing and informing the methodology for future microbiome studies in psoriasis.In contrast to Alekseyenko et al.53 Fahlen et al.11 examinedthe cutaneous microbiome using skin biopsies and targeted the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene using pyrosequenc- ing.

Langan et al.Ying S Zeng DN Chi L et al.

Future studies combining sequencing and culture data may address this limitation.As part of the Human Microbiome Project52 a smaller cohort that formed a longitudinal substudy by Alekseyenko et al.53 sought to determine the extent to which changes in the cutaneous microbiome were associated with psoriasis and whether these were influenced by systemic treatment.
