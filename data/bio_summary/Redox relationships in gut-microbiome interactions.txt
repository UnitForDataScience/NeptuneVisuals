A deeper understanding of the gut microflora's community redox signaling capacity and their symbiotic to dysbiotic effects on the host is critical to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on the rational targeting or enhancement of microbial function.The collection of reviews in this Special Issue of Free Radical Biology and Medicine explores recent advances in our understanding of basic molecular-redox mechanisms that govern host-microbe interactions that effect epithelial barrier function host metabolism immune responses and the development of cancer.

Both host and GI microbes are reliant on the host's respiratory system for oxygen and dietary input per os as the starting material for all other components of the redox effector toolkit.

EditorialRedox relationships in gut-microbiome interactionsThe gastrointestinal GI microflora represents a vast source of redox-based effector signals that regulate critical microbial and host cell functions that contribute to both our health and the initiation and progression of many important human diseases including the inflammatory bowel diseases diabetes rheumatoid arthritis atherosclerosis liver disease metabolic syndrome and cancer .

Composition of gut microbial communities and their expression of virulence factors and biosynthetic pathways varies along the biogeography of the GI tract in conjunction with different conditions of pH oxygenation nutrientenergy availability and host phenotype e.g.

The redox biochemistry of transition metals reactive oxygen species nitrogen oxides sulfurous compounds are then sourced and intertwined in local GI habitats and at multiple spatial scales to exert diverse functions to suit the homeostatic metabolic partnerships between host and GI microbial communities.

Likewise these same redox effector molecules in a pathogenic context can be weaponized by both the host and GI microbes for use against each other.

While the composition of a person's diet is a matter of choice to some extent the gut-microbiome redox interface can be further personalized by immutable factors such as host polymorphisms sex and age that summate to profoundly influence an individual's health-pathogenic redox balance.As the reviews featured in this Special Issue highlight several examples that demonstrate how redox plays a role in gut-microbiome interactions we see a snapshot of our current understanding and appreciate the potential to leverage this insight into new opportunities to improve health.
