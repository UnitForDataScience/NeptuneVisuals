larval drosophila's indigenous microbiota which is acquired from the environment regulates an orthologous hematopoietic pathway in their host.

we also dem- onstrate that drosophila's indigenous microbiota regulates expression of an orthologousfunctionally conserved obp-encoding gene.

shown is a representative western blot analysis using drosophila anti-ppo1 and anti-ppo2 antibodies.

taken together these results indicate that when intrauterine tsetse larvae express reduced levels of obp6 they present a dysfunctional melanization cascade during adulthood.obp6 mediates the crystal cell production pathway in larval tsetsein drosophila larvae a specific subset of hemocytes called crystal cells produce the majority of ppo.

in drosophila this treatment indu- ces spontaneous activation of ppo in crystal cells which are then visible as black melanotic spots on the larval cuticle .

these findings suggest that siobp6 larvae house either a reduced number of crystal cells or that thesecells exhibit a dysfunctional ppo pathway.in drosophila's lymph gland prohemocytes express the gata factor serpent and these cells sub- sequently differentiate into either functionally mature plasmatocyte phagocytic hemocytes or crys- tal cell lineages via induction of the hematopoietic transcription factors glial cells missing or lozenge respectively  .

thus symbiont-induced obp6 regulates tsetse hematopoiesis on a sys- temic level.obp28a drosophila's orthologue of tsetse obp6 is also symbiont regulated and functionally conservedhematopoietic signaling pathways and their transcriptional regulators within the niche are function- ally conserved across many animal taxa   .
