copyright c 2017 the authorslangerhans cells have been reported to induce a distinct pop- ulation of il-22 cd4 t cells that lack il-17 although the underlying molecular mechanism was not defined 14. simi- larly circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells dcs release soluble factors including il-6 and tnf-a which stimulate skin-homing cd4 t cells to express il-22 but not il-17 12. intestinal dcs have also been described to induce il-22 ex- pression in cd4 t cells but only in conjunction with other cytokines including ifn-g il-17 and il-10.

the pathways underpinning the specific induction of il-22 il-172 cd4 t cells in the human gut remains unknown 16.myeloid apcs may not be the only ag-presenting populations in the intestine that can modulate local cd4 t cell responses.

indeed microbe-responsive vg9vd2 t cells in the human gut express apc markers influence colonic cd4 t cell function 17 and may contribute to the pathology of ibd 18. whereas they are absent in rodents vg9vd2 t cells typically represent 1-5 of total t cells in human blood and tissues including the gut 17 18. intriguingly vg9vd2 t cells readily acquire apc characteristics in vitro induce naive and memory cd4 and cd8 t cell responses 19 20 and thus possess considerable potential for immunotherapeutic applications.

however little is known about the capacity of such gd t-apcs to polarize cd4 t cell responses especially in anatomical compartments other than blood.in this report we demonstrate that human microbe-responsive vg9vd2 t cells readily acquire gut-homing and ag-presenting functions and stimulate cd4 t cell responses distinct from those induced by monocytes or dcs.

gd t-apcs were cultured for 3 d and further purified either by positive selection or cell sorting to purities .99.2. bulk cd4 t cells .95 purity were isolated from pbmc via negative selection using the cd4 t cell isolation kit miltenyi.

to assess cd4 t cell responses to complex ag preparations apcs were cultured with 1 mgml ppd for the final 24 h of apc gener- ation and washed three times prior to coculture with autologous cd4 t cells.

these findings indicate that il-2 and il-15 play crucial and distinct roles in the acquisition of a gut-homing apc phenotype by human vg9vd2 t cells.gd t-apcs polarize naive cd4 t cells toward distinct effector phenotypeswhen assessing the resulting effector functions of stimulated cd4 t cells we observed striking outcomes depending on the type of apc used.

as with naive cd4 t cells both gdil-2 and gdil-15 t-apcs induced memory cd4 t cell proliferation with comparable efficiency to that displayed by mdcs fig.

these findings demonstrate that gd t-apcs can shape ag-specific adaptive immune responses and in- duce il-22 production in both naive and memory cd4 t cells.gd t-apcs polarize cd4 t cells via tnf-a and icoslwe next sought to identify the polarizing signals that facilitate gd t-apc polarization of t cell responses fig.
