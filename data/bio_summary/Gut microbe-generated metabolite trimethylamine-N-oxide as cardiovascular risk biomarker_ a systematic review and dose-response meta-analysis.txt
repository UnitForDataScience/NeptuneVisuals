TMAO pro- motes atherosclerosis probably through an increased expression of macrophage scavenger receptors and formation of foam cells in the artery wall.Accordingly non-lethal inhibition of microbial produc- tion of TMAO inhibits atherosclerotic lesions formation in mice.Of note increased levels of TMAO have been associated with a signifi- cant reduction in 'reverse cholesterol transport' as well as defects in cholesterol metabolic pathways in general.TMAO-dependent regulation of cholesterol transport and its relationship with athero- sclerosis seems to be related also to the effects of TMAO on bile acid composition.

It has been recently shown in two different studies that reduction in TMAO production by genetic inhibition of hepatic flavin mono-oxygenase 3 FMO3 which is under control of the bile acid-activated nuclear farnesoid X receptor FXR inhibits athero- sclerosis in different mouse models.-Finally high levels of TMAO promote endothelial dysfunction exacerbate platelet reactivity and enhance thrombosis affect lipid metabolism and inflammatory response underlying the importance of this molecule in the cardio- vascular system.-A significant number of studies involving different population sub- sets have demonstrated various levels of association between plasma levels of TMAO and CVD or mortality.-However the potential impact of TMAO as a novel biomarker of CVD and its prognostic role in disease progression has never been systematically addressed.

Although.recent mechanistic pre-clinical studies have identified TMAO as a.promising molecule involved in disease progression and associated.with cardiovascular eventsit is conceivable that the presencebetween TMAO levels and cardiovascular risk in populations with significantly different dietary environments including Asia and Middle East.Meta-regression analysis showed that except for the influence of CAD the association of TMAO levels and mortality was not modified by the baseline characteristics of the subject populations included in.of CVD might per se affect gut-microbiota composition and lead in.turn to increased production of TMAO feeding the vicious circle of.

The interest for TMAO .in cardiovascular research has recently arisen given the pre-clinical evidences revealing a mechanistic link between TMAO and CVD.- The adverse effects of TMAO on cardiovascular function have been associated with multiple pathways and mechanisms.

In this meta-analysis to harmonize the presentation of data we provide effect measures for the top High TMAO vs. the bottom Low TMAO tertile of TMAO distribution.

Interaction between subgroups was assessed as previously described.Dose-response meta-analysisBecause most of the primary studies we examined reported different cut-offs of plasma TMAO we performed a dose-response meta-analysis for our primary outcome by using the method proposed by Orsini et al.. mortality.Across all studies higher TMAO plasma levels were associated with.greater risk of all-cause mortality 14 studies for 16 cohorts enrolling.15 662 subjects HR 1.91 95 CI 1.40-2.61 P  0.0001 I2  94.comparing patients with 'high' vs. 'low' TMAO Figure ..When the analysis for all-cause mortality was repeated stratifying.the studies according to the presence or absence of CKD in the pri-.mary studies populations a significant association between TMAO.levels and all-cause mortality was found both in the CKD and non-.CKD cohort non-CKD 10 studies for 11 cohorts enrolling 13 195.subjects HR 1.79 95 CI 1.23-2.60 P  0.002 I2  94 CKD 5.studies enrolling 2467 subjects HR 2.27 95 CI 1.13-4.58 P  0.02.I2  91 P for interaction  ns Figure A.

Fish represent one of the most important dietary sources of TMAO precursor phosphatidylcholine and since both observational and randomized controlled trialshave clearly shown a protection from CVD after fish consumption the possible maladaptive link between TMAO and CVD has been questioned.

In studies reporting results.from two different cohorts of subjects the related estimates were.analysed separately....Quality assessment.Internal study validity was assessed using a scale developed by the.Methods Work Group for the US Preventive Service Task Force.USPSTF.This scale allows the assessment of the internal validity of.cohort studies included in meta-analysis on the basis of seven items i.initial comparability of groups ii maintenance of comparability iii.follow-up duration and loss of data iv adequateness of measurementsresults feeding those controversies.Given the need for synthetic .quantitative data addressing the potential use of TMAO as novel bio- marker in CVD we conducted the first systematic review and dose- response meta-analysis of published studies to quantitatively assess the association between TMAO plasma levels and cardiovascular outcomes.MethodsLiterature search strategyThe study was designed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA requirementsand the complete PRISMA checklist is provided in Supplementary material.v clear definition of the interventions vi relevance of the analysed out-.comes and vii analysis adjustments for confounders.

Based on the.above criteria studies were rated as 'good' if they met all criteria 'fair' if.not all criteria were met but there were no fatal flaws 'poor' if fatal flaws.existed group initially assembled were not close to be comparable or.maintained through the study invalid measurement instruments were.used key confounders given little or no attention more than 20 loss to.follow-up....End points and definitions.Two outcomes end points are reported in the present manuscript i.all-cause mortality primary outcome and ii MACCE secondary out-.come which was defined as the incidence of death myocardial infarction.and stroke.Statistical analysisHigh vs. low trimethylamine-N-oxide plasma levelsIn the primary studies the exposure variable TMAO concentration was reported in different ways either as a continuous or as a categorical trait and the effect measures with their corresponding 95 CI were reported per different increments in TMAO values e.g.
