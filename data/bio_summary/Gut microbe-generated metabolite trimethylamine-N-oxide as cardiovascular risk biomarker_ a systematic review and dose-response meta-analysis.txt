tmao pro- motes atherosclerosis probably through an increased expression of macrophage scavenger receptors and formation of foam cells in the artery wall.accordingly non-lethal inhibition of microbial produc- tion of tmao inhibits atherosclerotic lesions formation in mice.of note increased levels of tmao have been associated with a signifi- cant reduction in 'reverse cholesterol transport' as well as defects in cholesterol metabolic pathways in general.tmao-dependent regulation of cholesterol transport and its relationship with athero- sclerosis seems to be related also to the effects of tmao on bile acid composition.

it has been recently shown in two different studies that reduction in tmao production by genetic inhibition of hepatic flavin mono-oxygenase 3 fmo3 which is under control of the bile acid-activated nuclear farnesoid x receptor fxr inhibits athero- sclerosis in different mouse models.-finally high levels of tmao promote endothelial dysfunction exacerbate platelet reactivity and enhance thrombosis affect lipid metabolism and inflammatory response underlying the importance of this molecule in the cardio- vascular system.-a significant number of studies involving different population sub- sets have demonstrated various levels of association between plasma levels of tmao and cvd or mortality.-however the potential impact of tmao as a novel biomarker of cvd and its prognostic role in disease progression has never been systematically addressed.

although.recent mechanistic pre-clinical studies have identified tmao as a.promising molecule involved in disease progression and associated.with cardiovascular eventsit is conceivable that the presencebetween tmao levels and cardiovascular risk in populations with significantly different dietary environments including asia and middle east.meta-regression analysis showed that except for the influence of cad the association of tmao levels and mortality was not modified by the baseline characteristics of the subject populations included in.of cvd might per se affect gut-microbiota composition and lead in.turn to increased production of tmao feeding the vicious circle of.

the interest for tmao .in cardiovascular research has recently arisen given the pre-clinical evidences revealing a mechanistic link between tmao and cvd.- the adverse effects of tmao on cardiovascular function have been associated with multiple pathways and mechanisms.

in this meta-analysis to harmonize the presentation of data we provide effect measures for the top high tmao vs. the bottom low tmao tertile of tmao distribution.

the purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically estimate and quantify the association between tmao plasma levels mortality and major adverse cardio and cerebrovascular eventsmacce....................................................................................................................................................................................................methods and resultsmedline isi web of science and scopus databases were searched for ad hoc studies published up to april 2017. associations between tmao plasma levels all-cause mortality primary outcome and macce secondary outcome were systematically addressed.

association of tmao andmortality persisted in all examined subgroups and across all subject populations....................................................................................................................................................................................................conclusionsthis is the first systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrating the positive dose-dependent association between tmao plasma levels and increased cardiovascular risk and mortality.

fish represent one of the most important dietary sources of tmao precursor phosphatidylcholine and since both observational and randomized controlled trialshave clearly shown a protection from cvd after fish consumption the possible maladaptive link between tmao and cvd has been questioned.

in studies reporting results.from two different cohorts of subjects the related estimates were.analysed separately....quality assessment.internal study validity was assessed using a scale developed by the.methods work group for the us preventive service task force.uspstf.this scale allows the assessment of the internal validity of.cohort studies included in meta-analysis on the basis of seven items i.initial comparability of groups ii maintenance of comparability iii.follow-up duration and loss of data iv adequateness of measurementsresults feeding those controversies.given the need for synthetic .quantitative data addressing the potential use of tmao as novel bio- marker in cvd we conducted the first systematic review and dose- response meta-analysis of published studies to quantitatively assess the association between tmao plasma levels and cardiovascular outcomes.methodsliterature search strategythe study was designed according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma requirementsand the complete prisma checklist is provided in supplementary material.v clear definition of the interventions vi relevance of the analysed out-.comes and vii analysis adjustments for confounders.

for the same purpose the analyses of all-cause mortality and macce were repeated using a fixed-effect model which confirmed the significantly higher mortal- ity in the high tmao group vs. low tmao group in all the subgroups analysed see supplementary material online figures s5-s8.

accordingly using the fixed-effect model the association between all-cause mortality and tmao persisted also after adjustment for internal study validity and number of subjects included in the studies see supplementary material online figures s9 and s10.meta-regression analysis and publication biasto explore the potential impact of modifiers on the association between tmao plasma levels and all-cause mortality outcome we performed a meta-regression analysis of the baseline characteristics reported in more than 10 studies according to cochrane guide-.cardiocerebrovascular events in a large population of subjects.
