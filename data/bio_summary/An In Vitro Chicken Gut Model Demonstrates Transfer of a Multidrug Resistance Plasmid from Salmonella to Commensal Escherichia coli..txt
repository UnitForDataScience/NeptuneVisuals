Furthermore bacterial diversity measured by Adonis analysis comparing cefotaxime CTX-treated vessels with nontreated vessels using the weighted UniFrac beta diversity indicated that there were significant changes to the bacterial community after cefotaxime was administered P  0.001 and R2  0.134 .

Dilutions were plated onto Brilliance UTI urinary tract infection agar Oxoid Limited Basingstoke UK with or without cefotaxime 1 ugml recommended by EUCAST  as the appropriate screening concentration for isolates that are ESBL producers for enumeration of total presumptive E. coli and enterococci and to screen for presumptive ESBL-producing E. coli identified by their chromogenic properties on plates containing cefotaxime.

To identify statistically significant changes in the bacterial communities the 16S rRNA metagenomic data from all four experiments were analyzed using QIIME and structured to allow comparison by experiment number timeTABLE 1 Significance in differences between alpha and beta diversity indices for the variables experiment time point Salmonellainoculation and cefotaxime administrationpoint cefotaxime administration and Salmonella inoculation.

Bacterial com- munity profiles obtained by culture-independent methods showed that Salmonella inoculation resulted in no significant changes to bacterial community alpha diversity and beta diversity whereas administration of cefotaxime caused significant altera- tions to both measures of diversity which largely recovered.

The Chao1 and Shannon alpha diversity indices were calculated using QIIME and significant differences P  0.05 for the categorical variables were calculated in GraphPad Prism using the Mann-Whitney two-tailed test cefotaxime administration and the Kruskal-Wallis test time point Salmonella inoculation and experiment number.

In both experiments 3 and 4 culture on cefotaxime selective plates did not detect any presumptive E. coli resistant to cefotaxime in the cecal contents or at any time point in the two vessels to which Salmonella was not added.

In experiment 4 on the third day cefotaxime-resistant presumptive E. coli bacteria were detected on the Rambach agar plates supplemented with cefotaxime from two of the four vessels intoFIG 3 Quantitative bacteriology results for experiment 4 showing the number of CFU per milliliter of culture for presumptive cefotaxime-resistant Salmonella Rambach agar a enterococci UTI Brilliance agar b and cefotaxime-resistant E. coli Rambach agar c. Counts obtained from each of the six vessels employed in the experiment are shown as presented in the symbol key.

Presumptive E. coli bacteria recovered from plates without cefotaxime in experiments 3 n  6 isolates and 4 n  12 isolates were PCR negative for blaCTX-M1 and pIFM3844 Table S5.Whole-genome sequencing of commensal E. coli transconjugants.

For example administration of cefotaxime to the model resulted in signifi- cant decreases in alpha diversity an effect commonly reported for antibiotic adminis- tration and observed in vivo in chickens administered penicillin  tetracycline  or streptomycin  in rats administered cefotaxime  and in humans administered antibiotics including beta-lactams .

The published genomes of 12 E. coli isolates from poultry comprising commensal ESBL-harboring or avian pathogenic E. coli APEC isolates see Table S7 in the supplemental material were also mapped to E. coli K-12.
