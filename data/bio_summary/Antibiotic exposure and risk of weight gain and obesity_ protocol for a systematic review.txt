found that admin- istration of clarithromycin and metronidazole for treat- ment of helicobacter pylori infection in six individuals resulted in shifts in gut microbial communities and that alterations in gut microbiota composition persisted for up to 4 years post treatment in some participants  not surprisingly different classes of antibiotics have been associated with distinctive alterations in the gut microbiota given this likely influence of antibiotics on the composition of the gut microbiome it has been suggested that the use of antibiotic therapies in humans may be contributing to the increasing prevalence of obesity previous narrative reviews and opinion papers have cited observational studies in neonatal and pediatric popu- lations suggesting evidence of an association between anti- biotic use and increased body weight -.

studied human twins dis- cordant for obesity and found that fecal microbiota from obese twins transplanted into c57bl6j germ-free mice resulted in greater increases in adiposity as compared to those mice who received fecal microbiota from lean twins it has also been shown that adult c57bl6j germ-free mice gain less weight with a high fat sugar- rich diet as compared to conventionally raised mice with an intact gut microbiome further confirming that gut bacteria likely play a role in metabolism it has been proposed that the variations in gut bacteria associated with obesity may promote increased energy extraction from food passing through the gut via increased produc- tion of short-chain fatty acids .

in pregnant women secondary outcomes will also include maternal outcomes of gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention andor fetal out- comes of offspring birth weight and offspring childhood weight or risk of obesity.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.described with weight loss  obesity is also associ- ated with decreased gut microbial diversity compared to lean individuals  in pediatric populations higher numbers of bifidobacteria at age 6 and 12 months have been shown to be predictive of childhood overweight and obesity at 7 years of age evidence that these variations in gut bacteria profiles likely play a causal role in weight gain has been eluci- dated through fecal transplantation studies.

a systematic evaluation and synthesis of evidence is warranted given the potential public health implications if indeed antibiotic use in humans contributes to weight gain.objectivethe primary objective of this systematic review is to summarize the literature evaluating the potential associ- ation between antibiotic administration and weight gain andor obesity.

our secondary objective is to evaluate changes in gut microbiome composition and diversity associated with antibiotic-related changes in weight.

evidence of a causal relationship be- tween antibiotic use and weight gain in animal studies ispotentially supportive of a similar relationship in humans  .

however environmental studies for example evaluating levels of antibiotic metabolites in biologic fluids and whether this is associated with higher body weight will not be included.comparatorsall included studies must include a control group.

extracted participant demographics for intervention and control groups will include baseline weight andor bmi if applicable age at antibiotic administration mean or median percentage of male sex diet smoking physical activity measures and ethnicity.

there are a number of potential factors that could confound the relationship between antibiotic use and weight gain and thus the adjusted risk estimates will be of greatest inter- est in the included observational studies.

next the i2 statistic will be calculated to assess statistical heterogeneity using a cutoff of  0.75 to define signifi- cant heterogeneity between studies if the i2 value is below the pre-specified cutoff and clinical heterogeneity is also deemed to be reasonably low meta-analysis will be undertaken.reporting of the reviewthe methods and results of the systematic review will be reported in accordance with the prisma guidelines .discussionin our systematic review we will synthesize the evidence evaluating the association between antibiotic use and weight gain and risk of obesity in humans.

this review will provide a solid foun- dation for the design and implementation of future stud- ies that can better clarify the relationship between antibiotic use and weight gain in humans.additional filesabbreviationsbmi body mass index prisma preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysesacknowledgementshd is financially supported by fellowship awards from the university of ottawa department of medicine research fellowship award and the university of ottawa postgraduate medical education.
