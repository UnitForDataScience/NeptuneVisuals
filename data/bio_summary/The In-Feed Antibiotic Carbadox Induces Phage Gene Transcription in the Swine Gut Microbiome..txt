Nearly 50 of all reported bacterial genomes contain lysogenic prophage sequences  thus an antibiotic that induces pro- phage like carbadox could have profound impacts on many bacterial populations within a natural bacterial community.The goals of this study were to further define the breadth of carbadox-mediated impacts on the swine microbiome and to investigate the differential expression of bacterial gene families that may reveal global impacts on swine gut bacterial commu- nities.

In addition to an increase in antibiotic resistance antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations alter bacterial physiology including gene expression   and the frequent use of antibiotics in animal agriculture has contraindicated effects on the gut microbiome including altered microbiota composition  pathogen colo- nization susceptibility  co-selection for unintended antibiotic resistance genes   increased abundance of mobile genetic elements  and increased horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes via conjugation and transduction .

The results show decreased bacterial growth and metabolism prophage induction and potential transduction of bacterial fitness genes in swine gut bacterial communities as a result of carbadox administration.IMPORTANCE FDA regulations on agricultural antibiotic use have focused on anti- biotics that are important for human medicine.

Induction of the phage lytic cycle could alter bacterial community composition on the basis of the prophage content  and stability  of specific bacterial and phage populations and might facilitate antibiotic resistance gene transfer by transduction.When considering all of the effects of carbadox the genes that were overexpressed show that a multistep induction of the phage lytic cycle is one possible response.

Antibiotic resistance genes including genes that confer resistance to tetracycline beta-lactams and aminoglycosides as well as efflux pumps were located in the swine gut virome as well as one set of colocalized antibiotic resistance genes.

By inducing phages and their subsequent infection of new bacterial hosts phage genes including antibiotic resistance genes could be transferred to the bacterial metagenome and this has been shown to occur in vitro  .

Even though these resistance genes are not relatively more abundant in carbadox-fed swine gut viromes determination of absolute abundance was not attempted an increase in phage transduction promotes the exchange of bacterial and phage DNA including antibiotic resistance genes which is detrimental at any frequency  .

We predicted antibiotic resistance genes by using the Resfams database which was shown to be relatively stringent in assigning antibiotic resistance genes and accurately predicted the number of viral antibiotic resistance genes in fecal material .

None of these resistance genes are known to confer resistance to carbadox thus phages may mobilize genes that confer resistance to a suite of antibiotics beyond those administered to swine in the present study.

It is important to study possible side effects of carbadox use because it has been shown to promote bacterial evolution which could indirectly impact antibiotic resistance in bacteria of clinical importance.
