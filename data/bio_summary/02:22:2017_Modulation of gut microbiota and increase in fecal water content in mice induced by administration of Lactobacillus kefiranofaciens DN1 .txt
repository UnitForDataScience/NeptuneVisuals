Fecal water content was calculated after drying the fecal samples for 24 h in an 80 degC dry oven according to the equation fecal weight before drying - fecal weight after dryingfeces weight before drying x 100.DNA extraction from fecal samplesGenomic DNA was extracted from 50 mg of the fecal sample using the NucliSENS easyMAG system bioMerieux according to the manufacturer's instructions.16 Briefly 1.4 mL of lysis buffer was added to each fecal sample and thoroughly mixed by vortexing and pipetting until the feces had disintegrated.

We used real-time PCR as a powerful alternative method for this investigation focusing specifically on changes in the major bacterial phyla opportunistic pathogens and beneficial microbes.16 In addition the effects of L. kefiranofaciens admin-istration on fecal quality were also investigated to provide pre- liminary information for the development of a constipation- alleviating probiotic agent based on kefir lactic acid bacteria.Materials and methodsIsolation of L. kefiranofaciens from kefirKefir drink manufactured with natural kefir grains was pur- chased from Sensorgen Inc.

This genus has gained increasing attention as a commensal microbe in thehuman large intestine owing to its ability to degrade a broad spectrum of polysaccharides.3536 In addition Prevotella is responsible for the biosynthesis of vitamin B1 in the intestine and the formation of the gut barrier and a significantly reduced Prevotella population in the gut has been found to be associated with autism.3536 Recent studies found an increased population of intestinal Prevotella in both animals and humans fed a polysaccharide-rich diet.83738 Oral administration of wheat arabinoxylan increased the number of gut Prevotella in diet- induced obese mice.39 In addition children in rural Africa and South America consuming traditional plant-based meals har- bored an increased ratio of the phylum Bacteroidetes especially Prevotella which is associated with fiber utilization.3840As discussed above L. kefiranofaciens is a large producer of exopolysaccharides.910 In a previous study we demonstrated that L. kefiranofaciens DN1 produces capsular and secretory exopolysaccharides that exhibit antimicrobial activity.41 This may explain the increased population of Prevotella in the LKFDN1 group.4243ConclusionsAdministration of the novel probiotic strain L. kefiranofaciens DN1 isolated from kefir successfully altered the gut micro- biota by increasing the numbers of total bacteria Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Lactobacillus and Prevotella and decreasing the numbers of Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae and the pro- portion of genus Clostridium.

Although there was no significant difference between the groups in the number of stools produced in 30 min the total fecal weight of the LKFDN1 group was higher than that of the control group P  0.05 by 43.3 g. Similarly the fecal weight per stool was significantly higher in the LKFDN1 group 3.27 g increase P  0.05 as was the fecal water content 16.67 increase P  0.05.Constipation significantly impacts the health-related quality of life of those who suffer from it.21 Although medical therapy for constipation employs traditional laxatives and agents probiotics may be used to alleviate constipation by stimulating bowel movement bulking intestinal contents and causing acidification of colonic contents.22 Kefir has been used anecdotally for the treatment of diarrhea and consti-Change in mouse gut microbiota following administration of L. kefiranofaciens DN1WeassessedtheeffectsoforaladministrationofL.

The strain with the highest acid and bile toler- ance L. kefiranofaciens DN1 was selected and subjected to further experiments.Virulence attributes of L. kefiranofaciens DN1Using methods described by Murphy and Kavanagh18 the viru- lence attributes of L. kefiranofaciens DN1 were investigated by assessing hemolytic activity on blood agar to address the possibility of hemolysis in septic patients gelatinase activity screening proteinase activity to investigate the poten- tial for degradation of antibodies and penetration into adja- cent organs and growth inhibition at 42 degC survivability in the febrile immune response.

Considering these assays together L. kefiranofaciens DN1 was regarded as the best candidate for use in the animal experiment.Virulence attributes of L. kefiranofaciens DN1To demonstrate the safety of L. kefiranofaciens DN1 its hemo- lytic activity on blood agar gelatinase activity and growth inhi- bition at 42 degC were tested.

For calculation of the FirmicutesBacteroidetes FB ratio the gene copy number for Firmicutes was divided by that of Bacteroidetes for each mouse.16 For cal- culation of the percentage of Clostridium bacteria counts of the bacteria belonging to the genus Clostridium were divided by the counts of total bacteria.Results and discussionAcid and bile tolerances of L. kefiranofaciens from kefirWe isolated a total of 22 L. kefiranofaciens strains from kefir and these strains were subjected to acid and bile tolerance assays to determine their survivability in gastric and intestinal environ- ments Table 2.

Excess LPS permeates the mucosal barrier of the intestine and is absorbed into blood vessels inducing low-grade inflammation in various tissues and organs that can lead to metabolic syn- dromes such as diabetes and obesity.31 The results of our present study demonstrate that L. kefiranofaciens DN1 adminis- tration can improve intestinal health by inhibiting the prolifer- ation of harmful Enterobacteriaceae.In addition kefir and L. kefiranofaciens administration both decreased the proportion of Clostridium bacteria.
