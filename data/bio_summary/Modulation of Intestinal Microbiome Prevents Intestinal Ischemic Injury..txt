since butyrate is the primary source of energy used in proliferating and differentiating colonic epithelial cells it plays a key role in preserving the intestinal immune system and the mucosal barrier hill and artis 2010.recent studies have demonstrated in a rat model that butyrate pretreatment attenuates iri by conserving epithelial structure and function qiao et al.

2015. butyrate is the major product of lactate conversion by fecal microflorae bourriaud et al.

bifidobacteria's production of lactate has been demonstrated to be converted into butyrate by eubacterium hallii duncan et al.

after rats had been fully anesthetized by isoflurane isothesia tm 99.9ml dublin oh animal tissue dissection as performed in accordance with the guidelines of the animal care and use committee at yale university protocol 2015- 10253 as previously described in order to obtain the distal third of the small intestine was resected average 20 cm munoz- abraham et al.

both loops were perfused with hepes solution 115 mm of nacl 5 mm of kcl 1.2 of mgso4 1 mm of cacl2 10 mm of glucose 2 mm of nah2so4 and 32.2 mm of hepes at ph7.4 and an osmolarity of 300 mosm at 37c to remove any remaining intestinal debris.ex-vivo bowel perfusion devicesegments were attached to intestinal chambers of an ex- vivo bowel perfusion device munoz-abraham et al.

six trials were conducted using 30-min pretreatment of 5 mm methoxyacetate inhibitor in order to interrupt the conversion of lactate into butyrate yamazoe et al.

as reported in the literature butyrate diet supplementation in pigs stimulates villi elongation in both the ileum and the caecum crypts yamazoe et al.

butyrate additionally has considerable antioxidant anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic advantages aguilar et al.
