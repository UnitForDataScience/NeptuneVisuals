These particles can attach to the lungs and transport into the bloodstream  some are even found in the human brain .Smog and human healthHigh death rates were observed in areas with elevated ambient pollution levels.

Gill et al consider the human body as a superorganism with distinctive contributions from both microbes and the human host.

Additionally information on microbiota disruption based on functional geno- mics culturomics and general ecological principles should be included in the risk assessment of prolonged smog exposure to the health of human populations.Copyright c 2017 Food and Drug Administration Taiwan.

Chronic exposure to smog would undoubtedly disrupt theequilibrium of the microbial communities in the human body.

Besides reducing the burning of fossil fuels as the ultimate solution of smog formation advanced methods by using various physical chemical and biological means to reduce sulfur and nitrogen contains in fossil fuels could lower smog formation.

Oxidative stress has been identified as a unifying feature underlying the toxic ac-3.Smog in ChinaAs early as the 1970s China has recognized that the lung cancer rate at Xuanewi City northeastern of Yunnan Provincetions of smog e. This conclusion should not be surprising because O3 VOCs and the nanometal particles in smog can all induce free radicals e. Belyaeva and associates proposed that the electron transport chain of238ethe mitochondria is the prime target for heavy metal-induced neurotoxicity.Smog induced oxidative stressperoxidation such as malondialdehyde are mutagenic and carcinogenic .

The long-term effects of smog to the regime change of the human-associated microbes remain to be studied.Obviously reduction of fossil-fuel burning is the ultimatemethod to reduce smog formation.

Air pollutants such as carbon monoxide heavy metals nitrogen oxides ozone sulfur dioxide volatile organic vapors and particulate matters can induce oxidative stress in human directly or indirectly through the formation of reactive oxygen species.

The outermost boundary of human skin and mucous layers are covered by a complex network of human-associated microbes.
