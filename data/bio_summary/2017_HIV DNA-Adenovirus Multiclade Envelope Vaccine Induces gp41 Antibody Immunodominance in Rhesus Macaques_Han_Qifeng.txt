the demonstration of gp41 immunodominance in memory b cells of both adult and neonatal rms indicated that early vaccination could not over- come gp41 dominant responses.keywords hiv-1 envelope gp41 rhesus macaques hiv-1 vaccine microbiomenovember 2017 volume 91 issue 21 e00923-17journal of virology 1ecombinant monoclonal antibodies mabs isolated from blood plasmablasts of individuals with acute hiv-1 infection predominantly targeted env gp41 and were polyreactive with both host and environmental antigens including members of the intestinal microbiota .

moreover colonization of neonatal rms occurred within the first week of life and immunization of neonatal rms during this time also induced a dominant gp41-reactive antibody response.importance our results are critical to current work in the hiv-1 vaccine field eval- uating the phenomenon of gp41 immunodominance induced by hiv-1 env gp140 in rms and humans.

that is if we had used gp120 fluorophore-labeled proteins to decorate memory b cells would we have labeled as many gp120-reactive memory b cells as gp41-reactive memory b cells we compared the flow cytometric staining of memory b cells using fluorophore-labeled con-s and vrc-a gp120 envs with that of fluorophore-labeled gp140 envs for 8 rms.

thus determining if gp41-containing immunogens in hiv-1 vaccines induce a dominant gp41 response in rms is key to defining if rms are an appropriate animal model for evaluation of env-containing vaccines.studies have suggested that microbial antigens can stimulate immune cells and expand cd4 t cells and b cell repertoires .

polyreactive gp41-binding mabs can also be isolated from blood of uninfected individuals suggesting that the hiv-1 env gp41-reactive abs induced during acute hiv-1 infection originated from a subset of gp41 cross-reactive memory b cells previously activated by non-hiv-1 antigens  .

mabs produced from blood igd- memory b cells of rms were assayed for binding to autologous hiv-1 env gp120 gp140 and hiv-1 mn gp41 proteins.

of the gp41- reactive mabs 21 reacted with 1 of 9 non-hiv-1 host proteins and nucleic acids and 7 reacted with non-hiv-1-infected cells hep-2 cells in an immunofluorescencefig 3 legend continuedenvs x axis and af647-labeled envs y axis were defined as double positive env-reactive memory b cells.

we found that the dnarad5 vaccine elic- ited a higher frequency of gp41-reactive memory b cells than gp120-memory b cells in adult and neonatal rms.

vaccine env vrc-a a.92rw020 gp140 and a consensus group m con-s gp140 env were used as fluorophore-labeled recombinant proteins to identify env-specific memory b cells present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of neonatal and adult rms 4 weeks after final vaccination as described previously .

2014. hiv-1 envelope gp41 antibodies can originate from terminal ileum b cells that share cross-reactivity with commensal bac- teria.

a hiv-1-reactive mabs were isolated from single memory b cells of neonatal and adult rms and assayed for binding gp120 and gp41 proteins by elisa.

in dnarad5-vaccinated neonatal and adult rms the majority of anti-hiv-1 ab specificities of blood memory b cells were gp41 reactive.

analysis of the vaccine-induced env-reactive b cell repertoire revealed that the majority of hiv-1 env-reactive antibodies in both adult and neonatal rms were targeted to gp41.
