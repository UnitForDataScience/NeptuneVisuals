The demonstration of gp41 immunodominance in memory B cells of both adult and neonatal RMs indicated that early vaccination could not over- come gp41 dominant responses.KEYWORDS HIV-1 envelope gp41 rhesus macaques HIV-1 vaccine microbiomeNovember 2017 Volume 91 Issue 21 e00923-17Journal of Virology 1ecombinant monoclonal antibodies MAbs isolated from blood plasmablasts of individuals with acute HIV-1 infection predominantly targeted Env gp41 and were polyreactive with both host and environmental antigens including members of the intestinal microbiota .

Moreover colonization of neonatal RMs occurred within the first week of life and immunization of neonatal RMs during this time also induced a dominant gp41-reactive antibody response.IMPORTANCE Our results are critical to current work in the HIV-1 vaccine field eval- uating the phenomenon of gp41 immunodominance induced by HIV-1 Env gp140 in RMs and humans.

That is if we had used gp120 fluorophore-labeled proteins to decorate memory B cells would we have labeled as many gp120-reactive memory B cells as gp41-reactive memory B cells We compared the flow cytometric staining of memory B cells using fluorophore-labeled CON-S and VRC-A gp120 Envs with that of fluorophore-labeled gp140 Envs for 8 RMs.

Thus determining if gp41-containing immunogens in HIV-1 vaccines induce a dominant gp41 response in RMs is key to defining if RMs are an appropriate animal model for evaluation of Env-containing vaccines.Studies have suggested that microbial antigens can stimulate immune cells and expand CD4 T cells and B cell repertoires .

Polyreactive gp41-binding MAbs can also be isolated from blood of uninfected individuals suggesting that the HIV-1 Env gp41-reactive Abs induced during acute HIV-1 infection originated from a subset of gp41 cross-reactive memory B cells previously activated by non-HIV-1 antigens  .

MAbs produced from blood IgD- memory B cells of RMs were assayed for binding to autologous HIV-1 Env gp120 gp140 and HIV-1 MN gp41 proteins.

Of the gp41- reactive MAbs 21 reacted with 1 of 9 non-HIV-1 host proteins and nucleic acids and 7 reacted with non-HIV-1-infected cells HEp-2 cells in an immunofluorescenceFIG 3 Legend ContinuedEnvs x axis and AF647-labeled Envs y axis were defined as double positive Env-reactive memory B cells.

We found that the DNArAd5 vaccine elic- ited a higher frequency of gp41-reactive memory B cells than gp120-memory B cells in adult and neonatal RMs.

Vaccine Env VRC-A A.92RW020 gp140 and a consensus group M CON-S gp140 Env were used as fluorophore-labeled recombinant proteins to identify Env-specific memory B cells present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of neonatal and adult RMs 4 weeks after final vaccination as described previously .

HIV-1 envelope gp41 antibodies can originate from terminal ileum B cells that share cross-reactivity with commensal bac- teria.
