Interestingly we also found that sex differences in gut microbiota were affected by Avp genotype.Breeding genetic knockout and WT colonies in iso- lation may result in compositional differences in gut microbiota that are not truly reflective of genotype effects on microbiota composition.We avoided this confounding effect by generating all genotypes used inFigure 6.

PICRUSt analysis which demonstrates dif- ferences in the functional capacity of gut microbiota also suggests a differentiated microbiota for Het rats and highlights the effects of subject sex on genotype differences in microbiota composition.

Childrenwith asthma have a lower abundance of Lachnospira spp in their gut microbiota and germ-free mice colo- nized with a Lachnospira species show decreases in airway inflammation.Given the 2-way relationship between microbiota and the immune systemit is possible that Lachnospira spp suppress inflammation in a manner that promotes further replication of Lach- nospira spp in female KO rats.One mechanism by which Avp deletion may alter gut microbiota is via regulation of water consumption.

Wefound differences in microbiota across all 3 genotypes suggesting that Avp is haploinsufficient to restore microbiota observed in WT rats.

We reasoned that a 24-hour separation would not significantly alter microbiota composition as large-scale differentiation of microbiota composition requires several days in other modelsAll animals were subjected to the same single housing protocol.Our data suggest that haploid or diploid expression of the Avp gene differentially affects the abundance of specific bacterial taxa and that it does so in a sex-spe- cific manner.

KO rats exhibit differing levels of ultrasonic calls relative to WT and Het ratsand pup ultrasonic calls may be associated with rates of lickinggrooming which may potentially affect adult gut microbiota composition.Moving from behavior to cellular biology AVP may directly affect microbiota composition via recep- tors present on bacteria that may be structurally simi- lar to host neurotransmitterneuropeptide receptors.

Indeed many neurotransmitters are suggested to derive from bacterial origins through lateral gene transfer into the metazoan lineage.An in vitro study found that AVP was stable in a colonic environmentdevoid of fecal microbiota.Therefore AVP may be metabolized by the microbiota in a manner that influ- ences their growth cell death or functional output and may subsequently affect the host.AVP release potentially both centrally and systemi- cally modulates the activity of immune cellsand AVP-producing nuclei are responsive to inflammatory stimuli.Many immune cells also express AVP recep- tors.Similar to AVP gut microbiota both regulate and are shaped by the immune system.Therefore there may be a bidirectional link between gut micro- biota and AVP expression mediated by the immune system.

Future studies could investigate differences in behavioral and cytokine profiles in germ-free rats administered microbiota from WT versus KO Brattle- boro rats.In summary we characterized the gut microbiota of wildtype WT Long Evans rats and Long Evans rats carrying haploid heterozygous Het or diploid knockout KO deletions of the Avp gene also known as Brattleboro Rats and found a limited but poten- tially influential subset of significantly differentiated taxa that correspond with the immune status and anx- iety behavior differences observed between WT and KO rats.

One such systemic factor may be the gut microbiome which has recently been shown to influence both social and anxiety behaviors.Treatment of mice with antibiotics which produces large-scale reconfiguration and depletion of gut micro- biota decreases hypothalamic AVP expression.This suggests that microbiota may influence AVP expression.
