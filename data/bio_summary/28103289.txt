when common costs of fmt were increased by 81 of the baseline estimate fidaxomicin eur2464 0.199 qaly was on the efficiency frontier with an icer of eur69890qaly compared with pulsed-tapered van- comycin eur1235 0.181 qaly and fmt via enema eur2690 0.202 qaly compared with fidaxomicin had an icer of eur72212qaly.when considering a scenario where cure and recurrence rates of fmt via duodenal infu- sion were the same as the ones of fmt via colonoscopy fmt via duodenal infusion eur1581 0.2048 qaly was on the efficiency frontier with an icer of eur14678qaly compared with pulsed-tapered vancomycin and both other routes of fmt administration were dominated.probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10000 monte carlo simulations demonstrated that fmt via enema was the most cost-effective strategy in 58 of simulations and fmt via colo- noscopy was favored in 19 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of eur32000qaly.

the aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of treatments for the management of second recurrence of community-onset cdi in france.methodswe developed a decision-analytic simulation model to compare 5 treatments for the man- agement of second recurrence of community-onset cdi pulsed-tapered vancomycin fidax- omicin fecal microbiota transplantation fmt via colonoscopy fmt via duodenal infusion and fmt via enema.

the aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 5 strategies constructed from the escmid guideline for the management of multiple recurrence of cdi in adults where the first-line treatments were pulsed-tapered vancomycin fidaxomicin fmt via colonoscopy fmt via duodenal infusion and fmt via enema.methodsmodel structurewe conducted a decision-analytic model comparing 5 strategies for the management of sec- ond recurrence of cdi according to the escmid guideline .

fidaxomicin and fmt via duodenal infusion were domi- nated by fmt via colonoscopy and fmt via enema they were both more expensive and less effective than fmt via colonoscopy and fmt via enema.sensitivity analysesdeterministic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the potential impact of six factors on the base case results probabilities of cure and probability of relapse of vancomycin probability base case analysis of competing strategies for the management of second recurrence of community-onset clostridium difficile infection.abbreviations fmt fecal microbiota transplantation icer incremental cost-effectiveness ratio qaly quality-adjusted life year.

indeed varying this parameter within its stated range led to a change of sign in the icer when considering fmt via enema versus fmt via colonoscopy fmt via enema became either less effective and costlier that fmt via colonoscopy or more effective and less costly than fmt via colonoscopy.in addition a threshold analysis was performed to find the variation in common costs of fmt that would change the strategies lying on the efficiency frontier.

a recent study focusing on the economic consequences of recurrent cdi compared to patients with cdi who did not experience a recurrence showed that there were substantially higher pharmacological and hos- pitalization costs among the patients with recurrent cdi .treatment of multiple recurrent cdi remains challenging.

third occurrence of mild-to-moderate cdi diagnosed at an outpatient visit fig a-e in .following european guidelines the first-line therapies for the strategies were pulsed-tapered vancomycin fidaxomicin fmt via colonoscopy fmt via duodenal infusion and fmt via enema .

this does not alter our adherence to plos one policies on sharing data and materials.conclusionsfmt via enema is the most cost-effective initial strategy for the management of second recurrence of community-onset cdi at a willingness-to-pay threshold of eur32000qaly.introductionclostridium difficile infection cdi is the leading cause of healthcare associated diarrhea pre- senting a significant burden to global healthcare systems .

rates of community- acquired cdi have also increased and community-associated cdi is estimated to be responsi- ble for more than one third of all cdi cases .

abbreviations cdi clostridium difficile infection fmt fecal microbiota transplantation.doi10.1371journal.pone.0170258.g001cdi and cost-effectiveness analyses evaluating fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in cdi --.as defined in european guidelines we considered recurrent cdi to be an episode occur- ring within 8 weeks after the onset of a previous episode that resolved after completion of the initial treatment .

patients who failed treatment either had mild-to-moderate cdi severe uncomplicated cdi or severe complicated cdi.

patients initially cured could develop a recurrence of mild-to-moderate cdi severe uncomplicated cdi or severe complicated cdi.

we used the definition of severe cdi reported in european guidelines to define the probability of having severe uncomplicated cdi and severe complicated cdi .

probability of cure and of relapse of pulsed-tapered vancomycin and probability of cure of fmt via enema and to a lesser extent cost of severe cdi and utility of mild cdi had an influence on the model .
