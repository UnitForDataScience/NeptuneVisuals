Finally to examine whether antibiotics influenced shar- ing levels between household members and their environment we repeated the primary shar- ing analysis excluding those samples for which caregivers reported antibiotic use among children cattle or chickens in the one-month period prior to sample collection.ResultsStudy households and subject demographicsAmong 180 households contacted sampling was performed at 158 yielding 184 child stool samples 158 cattle stool samples 158 chicken cloacal swab samples and 316 household surface samples.

InPrincipal coordinate analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances representing phylogenetic clustering of gut and environmental microbiome constituents in samples from households in western Kenya.doi10.1371journal.pone.0171017.g002multivariable analysis household wealth status and child livestock feeding remained statisti- cally significant in their association with gut microbiome diversity .Using the Bray-Curtis divergence metric as the outcome none of the tested factors includ- ing number of animals owned number of household members household wealth child age child sex reported child interactions with livestock or livestock housing showed univariable associations with microbiome similarity between children and cattle.

The taxonomic groups present in the environmental samples were highly variable with Proteobacteria as the most abundant 35.6 in living space samples and Firmicutes in cooking area samples 28.1.

Among the 156 households studied chil- dren within the same household significantly shared their gut microbiome with each other although we did not find significant sharing of gut microbiome across host species or house- hold surfaces.

The maturation and structure of the gut microbiome can therefore have a long-term impact on health and gut microbiome dysbiosis has been asso- ciated with various disease states including malnutrition -.

In order to promote health among young children it is necessary to understand the environmental influences of gut microbiome development.The maturation of the infant gut microbiome is marked by periods of abrupt change based on life events dietary changes and changes in environment .

To investigate the role of animal and household contact on gut microbiome of children in rural livestock-owning households we studied the species composi- tion of the gut microbiomes of young children cattle and chickens and of the microbiome of household surfaces in western Kenya.

Examining the similarity of the gut microbiome of children living in the same household across 20 households that included two children dem- onstrated that sharing between the gut microbiome of children from the same household was significantly higher than sharing between children living in different households p  0.0027 Bray-Curtis distance Wilcoxon rank-sum test .

Results did not differ when using the Jaccard distance metric as the outcome data not shown.DiscussionIn this study we describe the microbial constituents of the gut from young children in western Kenya the gut of their household livestock and their household environment.

Our finding that higher wealth status was associated with lower gut microbiome diversity was consistent with a recent study in Malaysia reporting that the children in the group of the highest socio-economic position had the lowest gut microbiome diversity .
