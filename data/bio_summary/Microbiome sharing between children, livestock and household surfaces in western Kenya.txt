examining the similarity of the gut microbiome of children living in the same household across 20 households that included two children dem- onstrated that sharing between the gut microbiome of children from the same household was significantly higher than sharing between children living in different households p  0.0027 bray-curtis distance wilcoxon rank-sum test .

finally to examine whether antibiotics influenced shar- ing levels between household members and their environment we repeated the primary shar- ing analysis excluding those samples for which caregivers reported antibiotic use among children cattle or chickens in the one-month period prior to sample collection.resultsstudy households and subject demographicsamong 180 households contacted sampling was performed at 158 yielding 184 child stool samples 158 cattle stool samples 158 chicken cloacal swab samples and 316 household surface samples.

overall we found that the gut microbiome of children is more likely to be shared with other children within the household compared to children from different households.

to investigate the role of animal and household contact on gut microbiome of children in rural livestock-owning households we studied the species composi- tion of the gut microbiomes of young children cattle and chickens and of the microbiome of household surfaces in western kenya.

the taxonomic groups present in the environmental samples were highly variable with proteobacteria as the most abundant 35.6 in living space samples and firmicutes in cooking area samples 28.1. a pcoa plot demonstrated that overall the community structures within each sample type were similar to each other and relatively distinct from community structures in other sample types .microbial sharing within and between householdsusing the bray-curtis metric to assess the similarity between samples demonstrated a general trend by which members or household surfaces from the same household had higher otu sharing compared to members or household surfaces from different households although most comparisons were not statistically significant .

we anticipate that this would lead to a nondifferen- tial nullifying impact on the observed relationships.conclusionin rural villages the gut microbiome of children appears to be shared between children within the same household.

children within the same household and surfaces within the same household show significantly similar microbial communities.doi10.1371journal.pone.0171017.g003proportion of microbiome sharing between children and other household samples in three households in western kenya.

in order to promote health among young children it is necessary to understand the environmental influences of gut microbiome development.the maturation of the infant gut microbiome is marked by periods of abrupt change based on life events dietary changes and changes in environment .

results did not differ when using the jaccard distance metric as the outcome data not shown.discussionin this study we describe the microbial constituents of the gut from young children in western kenya the gut of their household livestock and their household environment.

our finding that higher wealth status was associated with lower gut microbiome diversity was consistent with a recent study in malaysia reporting that the children in the group of the highest socio-economic position had the lowest gut microbiome diversity .

to determine the household influences of gut micro- biome structure we assessed microbial sharing within households in western kenya by sequencing 16s rrna libraries of fecal samples from children and cattle cloacal swabs from chickens and swabs of household surfaces.

to compare the taxonomic compositions of samples from different origins or hosts we conducted a principal coordinate analysis pcoa on the unifrac distances between all samples.to address the primary question of whether children shared more microbes with hosts in their own households than with hosts in other households we calculated pairwise distances between all samples using bray-curtis abundance metrics through qiime  .

if a household had more than two children  fu huai 5 years old the children were ordered in a random list from which the first two were approached to enroll.

study children were predominantly 60 female and ranged in age from 10 months to 66 months at the time of sampling some children were over age five because sampling was conducted after initial selection and consent for the study.
