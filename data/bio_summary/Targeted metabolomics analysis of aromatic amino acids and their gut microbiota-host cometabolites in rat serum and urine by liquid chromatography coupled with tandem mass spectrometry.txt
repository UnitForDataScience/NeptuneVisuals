in this regard meth- ods using lc-msms have been reported for the analysis of several endogenous metabolites from tissue and biologi- cal systems 24-28. nevertheless most of these quantitative methods focus on amino acids or uremic toxins rather than the gut microbiota cometabolic pathways of aromatic amino acids.to the best of our knowledge no method has been reported that is able to analyze aromatic amino acids and their gut microbiota-host cometabolites simultaneously in a single run.

these results fulfilled the requirements indicating that this method was accurate reli- able and reproducible.the extraction recoveries of seven analytes in biological samples are summarized in table 2. at all three qc lev- els of analytes the extraction recoveries of serum ranged from 84.03 to 101.28 and those of urine were from 89.16 to 99.85 while the rsd was 9.91 or less for all of the recoveries.matrix effects of the seven analytes are summarized in sup- porting information table s2.

the metabolism of aromatic amino acids caused by intestinal microbiota can generate indole and p-cresol pc 14. subsequently indole and pc are absorbed and sulfated turning into indoxyl sul- fate ils and p-cresyl sulfate pcs respectively 15. the gut microbiota-host cometabolic pathways of aromatic amino acids are shown in fig.

monitoring the alternation of cometabolites can provide a more comprehen- sive understanding of gut microbial metabolism and these cometabolites are important modulators of host physiology in the intestinal tract.in a previous study our research group developed auhplc-msms method for the quantification of 11 key gut microbiota-host cometabolites including phenylacetyl- glutamine phenylacetylglycine hippurate succinate for- mate a-ketoglutarate citrate butyric acid dimethylamine trimethylamine and trimethylamine-n-oxide 13. neverthe- less this quantitative method did not contain some key aro- matic amino acids derived microbial metabolites because the compounds were weakly retained on the acquity beh amide column.
