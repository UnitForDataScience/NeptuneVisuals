FD-based imaging such as affinity imaging is limited by poor temporal and lateral resolution i.e.

Recent examples of multiparametric imaging experiments include mapping single bacteriophages at the surface of living bacteria imaging the adhesion and elasticity of bacterial pathogensand the nanomechanical mapping of the binding events between viruses and animal cells.

On soft cells like Gram-negative bacteria the resolution is poorer because the cell is damaged due to the local pressure applied by the tip or loosely bound molecules such as polysaccharides contaminate the tip.The best resolution so far has been achieved on purifiedmembranes.

AFM tips functionalized with ligands can be employed to probe cell surface receptors providing new insights into their biophysical properties.In addition by recording spatially resolved FD curves researchers can map the distribution of receptors a method known as affinity imaging first described by the Gaub group.Lectin-modified tips could localize single glycolipids in the membrane of red blood cells.
