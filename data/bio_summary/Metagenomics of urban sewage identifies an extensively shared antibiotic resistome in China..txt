Municipal sewage harbored diverse and abundant resistance genes conferring resistance to almost all antibiotics highlight- ing that municipal sewage could be a major conduit for transferring antibiotic resistance genes into the envir- onment.

This suggests that monitoring sewage systems for ARGs could provide a real-time estimate of antibiotic resist- ance threats in specific areas and this in turn could be used to inform treatments and to promote stewardship of antibiotics.ConclusionsCurrently sound and necessary data on seasonal and geographical characterization of antibiotic resistome in urban sewage is still lacking.

A strong spatial dependency in the distribution of ARG abundance in various administrative areas were ob- served with two main regions separated by the demo- graphic Hu Huanyong line which is based on climatic zonation and population density It was previously reported that industrialization was correlated with theantibiotic resistance burden of the human gut and this was in turn driven by age diet cultural tradition cli- mate pathogen carriage and periodic perturbation for example by antibiotic exposure  A similar geo- graphic distribution was found in the antibiotic emission densities in Chinese river basins suggesting that hu- man activities are the major driver of resistance gene distribution.Geographical clustering was not observed in the struc- ture of either antibiotic resistome or bacterial commu- nity in Chinese sewage.

These data provide dynamic background seasonal and geographical variation for mitigation activities in WWTPs based on the presence of ARGs and practical guide for improving antibiotic management in the urban sewage.Additional filesAbbreviationsARGs Antibiotic resistance genes CARD Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database HGT Horizontal gene transfer HMP HumanMicrobiome Project MetaHit Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract MGEs Mobile genetic elements MLS Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin resistance NMDS Non-metric multidimensional scaling OTUs Operational taxonomic units RDP Ribosomal Database Project SNC-ARDB Structured Non-redundant Clean Antibiotic Resistance Genes DatabaseWWTPs Wastewater treatment plantsAcknowledgementsWe thank all the volunteers for their help in collecting samples.FundingThis study was financially supported by the National Key Research andDevelopment Plan 2016YFD0800205 the Natural Science Foundation of China 21210008 the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences IUEQN201504 the International Science  Technology Cooperation Program of China 2011DFB91710 and Youth InnovationPromotion Association CAS.Availability of data and materialsRaw sequencing data of 16S rRNA genes from urban sewage were deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive SRA with submission ID SUB1899726 and BioProjectID PRJNA340927.Authors' contributionsJQS collected samples analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript.

A nation-wide survey of resistance ele- ments in sewage untreated influent could then provide a rapid and efficient method for assessing the burden of antibiotic resistance from urban populations.Urban sewage compositions are subject to strong temporal and environmental variation in conditions.

Signifi- cantly different seasonal abundances were observed for 27 ARG subtypes Additional file Figure s2a.Geographical burden of ARGs in Chinese urban sewage No distinct regional distribution pattern of the antibiotic resistome was observed among the sewage samples from different cities Additional file Figures S3a and S3b and Fig.

Additionally the copy num- ber of resistance genes discharged by each person per day in urban areas is defined as 'ARG load' which can be cal- culated by the formula ARG load copiescapitaday the average concentration of sewage ARGs x the vol- ume of municipal sewage dischargeurban population.

Bacterial biomass in sewage has been quantified using flow cytometry within the range from 1010 to 1012 cellsL  and this is consistent with our results when normalizing for 16S rRNA gene copy number per cell.The total output of resistance genes was estimated by considering the amount of domestic sewage and urban populations in Chinese administrative districts to quan- tify the regional ARG burden at a national scale.
