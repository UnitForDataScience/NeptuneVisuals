temperatureand temperature-dependent organic matter load can foster the proliferation of microbial taxa that carry re- sistance genes or improve the growth of non-resistant microorganisms 5. antibiotic administration could also explain the clear seasonality in shifts within the sewage resistome  2. seasonal variation in antibiotic consumption driven by associated seasonality in path- ologies exerts selective pressure leading to selection and subsequent dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in wastewater .

a strong spatial dependency in the distribution of arg abundance in various administrative areas were ob- served with two main regions separated by the demo- graphic hu huanyong line which is based on climatic zonation and population density it was previously reported that industrialization was correlated with theantibiotic resistance burden of the human gut and this was in turn driven by age diet cultural tradition cli- mate pathogen carriage and periodic perturbation for example by antibiotic exposure  a similar geo- graphic distribution was found in the antibiotic emission densities in chinese river basins suggesting that hu- man activities are the major driver of resistance gene distribution.geographical clustering was not observed in the struc- ture of either antibiotic resistome or bacterial commu- nity in chinese sewage.

this suggests that monitoring sewage systems for args could provide a real-time estimate of antibiotic resist- ance threats in specific areas and this in turn could be used to inform treatments and to promote stewardship of antibiotics.conclusionscurrently sound and necessary data on seasonal and geographical characterization of antibiotic resistome in urban sewage is still lacking.

significant seasonal differences were observed in the urban sewage antibiotic resistome p  0.01. sea- sonal temperature changes might have a significant in- fluence on the variation of antibiotic resistance and on the composition of microbial community.

municipal sewage harbored diverse and abundant resistance genes conferring resistance to almost all antibiotics highlight- ing that municipal sewage could be a major conduit for transferring antibiotic resistance genes into the envir- onment.

a nation-wide survey of resistance ele- ments in sewage untreated influent could then provide a rapid and efficient method for assessing the burden of antibiotic resistance from urban populations.urban sewage compositions are subject to strong temporal and environmental variation in conditions.

signifi- cantly different seasonal abundances were observed for 27 arg subtypes additional file figure s2a.geographical burden of args in chinese urban sewage no distinct regional distribution pattern of the antibiotic resistome was observed among the sewage samples from different cities additional file figures s3a and s3b and fig.

thus seasonally variable release of antibiotics bacteria and resistance genes into municipal sewage can alter bacterial populations and remodel their resistome  7. a recent study on sewers further sup- ported the speculated reason demonstrating a clear sea- sonal pattern in the relative abundances of resistance genes and that this coincided with the overall rates of antibiotic prescription 12.higher concentrations of args were detected in win- ter sewage being approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of summer.

antibiotic resistant pathogens now occur at high frequencies in clinical contexts and are increasingly being found in environmental settings such as water correspondence  equal contributors4environmental biotechnology laboratory the university of hong kong pokfulam road hong kong china1key lab of urban environment and health institute of urban environmentchinese academy of sciences 1799 jimei road 361021 xiamen china full list of author information is available at the end of the articlebodies  soils and animal feces in particular the frequent presence of multi-antibiotic resistant superbugs in human feces predicts a return to the pre-antibiotic era where a growing number of infec- tions can no longer be treated using the current arsenal of drugs consequently the world health organization has endorsed a global action plan on antimicrobial resist- ance which calls upon all nations to adopt mitigation strategies within 2 years  however there is still more to understand about the ecology and evolution of antibiotic resistance.

and additional file figure s7d.linking antibiotic resistome with bacterial phylogeny in chinese urban sewageco-occurrence patterns between antibiotic resistance and bacterial assemblages were explored based on strong r  0.7 and significant p  0.01 correlations fig.

co-occurrence using network analysis is summarized in additional file dataset 4. mantel test indicated that the antibiotic resistome was significantly correlated with bacterial phylogeny p  0.01. explor- ation of connections between args and bacterial generashowed that most genera from the same phylum had similar antibiotic resistance profiles additional file table s3 but this does not prove that bacterial otus were actually hosts of resistance genes.

however if and how the composition of microbial community and antibiotic resistomes change with sea- sons and regions in urban sewage have not been exten- sively investigated.
