Insulin resistance improved 6 weeks after the FMT but at 12 weeks nosignificant effect was observed anymore on metabolic parameters and fecal microbiota composition Vrieze et al 2012.The reason why FMT has such variable efficacy is probably due to the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota.

However FMT's breakthrough as the method of choice for the treatment of persistent Clostridium difficile infection CDI came only after a double-blind randomized trial van Nood et al 2013 which demonstrated 94 effi- cacy of FMT compared with 31 after conservative treatment with vancomycin.MT as a treatment modality has also been tested in a range of other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease IBD irritable bowel syndrome obesity and metabolic syndrome as well as neurological and psychological disorders although most reports of the latter category are merely anecdotal.

CommentaryAn evaluation of the therapeutic potential of fecal microbiota transplantation to treat infectious and metabolic diseasesAlbert K Groen12  Max Nieuwdorp134Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT has had a long history in medicine for treating a number of human diseases.

In contrast FMT recipients with metabolic syndrome were obese but otherwise healthy individuals with a stable and diverse fecal microbiota.

As early as during the 4th century BC FMT was used in China to treat patients with food poisoning and diarrhea.

It was not until the late 1950s that FMT garnered interest again when the first reports about its use to treat fulminant enterocolitis appeared in the scientific literature.

Reports about using FMT to treat IBD patients show considerable heterogeneity in terms of clinical effect Moayyedi et al 2015 whereas efficacy in patients with metabolic syndrome was tran- sient.

CDI patients who have been treated multiple times with antibiotics have most of their bacterial diver- sity wiped out FMT effectively repopulates this vacated space with a stable and healthy bacterial community Girotra et al 2016.

Further investigation of why FMT failed to engraft novel species or change the gut microbiota in these naive patients confirmed that their bacterial community is largely resilient to accepting new members in their midst.
