simultaneously saa3 induces tnf-a and il-6 expression which results in further up-regulation of muc2 by tnf-a and other mucins by il-6 and also saa3 expression by tnf-a and il-6 to protect epithelial cells from bacterial infection.and that saa3 plays a role in intestinal immunity with cytokines to protect epithelial cells from bacterial infection.in summary this study showed that amino acids 1-36 of saa3 induced muc2 expression and we propose a mechanism by which saa3 induces muc2 expression in cmt-93 cells after gram negative bacterial infection .

in addition to the up-regulation of muc2 expression by saa3 and tnf-a it has been reported that tnf-a induces saa3 mrna expression in cmt-93 cells  and mouse granulosa tumor ov3121-1 cells .moreover il-6 induces other mucins muc4 and muc5b aside from muc2   and also induces saa3 expression -.

the mechanism for the induction of muc2 expression by saa3 also remains unclear.in this study to identify the responsible amino acid sequence region of saa3 for muc2 expression recombinant murine saa1 rsaa1 rsaa3 and rsaa13 a chimera protein con- structed with mature saa1 amino acids 1-36 and saa3 amino acids 37-103 and vice versa for rsaa31 were added to murine colonic epithelial cmt-93 cells and the mrna expressions of muc2 and cytokines were analyzed.

tnf-a inhibitor did not signif- icantly affect the induction of muc2 mrna expression  meaning that tnf-a might not contribute to the induction of muc2 mrna expression at 2 h.induction of ikb-a mrna expression by rsaasit has been reported that saa3 is an endogenous peptide ligand for the tlr4md2 complex the activated nf-kb signaling pathway in metastatic mouse lung  and the tlr4md2 com- plex expressed in colonic epithelial cells .

saa3 which is up-regulated during acute and chronic inflammatory responses is predominantly expressed by macrophages and other cells including adipocytes epithelial cells and endothelial cells in mice -.

therefore the 1-36 amino acid region of saa3 likely has the ability to activate the nf-kb signaling path- way via tlr4md2 and induce muc2 expression in cmt-93 cells.since it has been reported that tnf-a up-regulates muc2 expression in human intestinal cancer ls180 cells  and colonic epithelial ht-29 cells  it is possible that the inductioninduction of ikb-a expressions in cmt-93 cells by rsaas.

in this study to identify responsible regions in saa3 for muc2 expression recombinant murine saa1 rsaa1 rsaa3 and rsaa13 a chimera pro- tein constructed with mature saa1 amino acids 1-36 and saa3 amino acids 37-103 and vice versa for rsaa31 were added to murine colonic epithelial cmt-93 cells and the mrna expressions of muc2 and cytokines were measured.

however the expression of saa3 but not saa1 or 2 is increased on the mouse colon surface in the presence of microbiota  and lipopolysaccharide lps strongly induces mrna expression of saa3 in murine colonic epithelial cmt-93 cells   .

as expected  the molecular weights of expressed rsaa1 rsaa3 rsaa13 and rsaa31 were approximately 16.1 16.1 16.0 and 16.3 kda respectively.induction of muc2 mrna in cmt-93 cells by rsaasto identify the responsible region in saa3 for muc2 expression cmt-93 cells were incu- bated with rsaa1 rsaa3 rsaa13 or rsaa31.

rsaas did not affect the mrna expressions of reg iii-g a-def b-def-3 or b-def-4 data not shown.induction of cytokine mrna and protein expressions by rsaasour previous study showed that both saa1 and saa3 enhanced il-6 and tnf-a mrna expression .

interestingly the tflk motif in bovine mammary- associated saa3 increases muc3 expression in a heterologous host human intestinal epithe- lial ht-29 cells  a finding that indicates a potential therapeuticprobiotic use of saa3 to protect intestines from bacterial infection in humans and animals.

expression of saa3 is increased on the mouse colon surface in the presence of microbiota in vivo and it increases mrna expression of mucin 2 muc2 in murine colonic epithelial cells in vitro which constitutes a protective mucus barrier in the intestinal tract.

moreover our previous study demonstrated that saa3 but not saa1 increases mrna expression of mucin 2 muc2 in cmt-93 cells .

p0.01.nf-kb signaling pathway was activated by saas cells were treated with rsaa1 rsaa3 rsaa13 or rsaa31 and then ikb-a mrna expressions were examined because ikb-a mrna levels quantitatively result in nf-kb activation .

ikb-a mrna expressions were strongly induced by rsaa3 and rsaa31  these results were consistent with those obtained from muc2 mrna expressions .nf-kb inhibitor reduced muc2 tnf-a and il-6 mrnato test whether saa proteins regulate muc2 expression through the nf-kb signaling path- way cells were exposed to an nf-kb inhibitor cape before incubation with rsaas.
