Levels of F. prausnitzii M212 decreased without statistical significance p  0.61.Number of bacterial species was reduced by EEN in CD p  0.672 the ratios of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides fragilis were reduced p  0.664 and 0.034 respectively and Enterococcus was increased p  0.788.Concentration of fecal acetic acid was reduced by EEN p  0.05 and butyric and valeric acids were increased p  ns.

The greatest change was seen in Ruminococcaceae p  0.001 and the least in the Bacteroides-Prevotella group p  0.01.Levels of F. prausnitzii A2-165 decreased significantly p  0.0046 after treatment compared to baseline and to other groups.

34 genera significantly were reduced over the EEN course including F. prausnitzii only Lactococcus increased with EEN.Microbiota composition changed within one week of EEN moving farther from the centroid of healthy controls overallp  0.05 among responders p  0.02 among non responders p  0.14.Abundance of six genera changed after one week p  0.05.

a decrease in genera from the Proteobacteria phylum particularly Sutterella p  0.05 was observed whereas Alistipes p  0.05 and Bifidobacterium p  0.1 increased over the course of EEN .

EEN decreased the abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes p  0.039 and increased the abundance of Firmicutes p  0.027.A decrease in genera from theGuinet-Charpentier C et al.

Sequences were compared to 28 complete microbial genomes annotated with KEGG.Proteobacteria phylum particularly Sutterella was observed p  0.05 whereas Alistipes p  0.05 and Bifidobacteriump  0.1 increased during EEN.Species diversity Chao-1 index decreased among sustained remission SR samples whereas it increased among the non-SR samples over the course.

demonstrated a decrease in the bacterial diversity richness calculated as the total number of bands on the TTGE images after 30 days of EEN p  0.041 persisting at the end of EEN p  0.037 .

The authors initially identified eight metabolic pathways that differed significantly between CD patients and controls p value  0.1 the comparison of these eight pathways showed that SR patients were much more similar to controls compared to non-SR patients in the abundance of these pathways non-SR patients differed significantly in the abundance of seven of the eight pathways while SR-patients differed significantly from the controls in the abundance of two pathways only p value  0.05 after correction according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg.
