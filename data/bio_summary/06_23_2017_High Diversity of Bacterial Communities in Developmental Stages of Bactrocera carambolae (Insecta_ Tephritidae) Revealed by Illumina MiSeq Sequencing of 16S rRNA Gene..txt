Fur- thermore there are also few studies on Bactrocera microbiomes based on next-generation sequencing    .High diversity of bacterial communities in developmental stages1077The present study was carried out to determine 1 the diversity and relative abundance of bacterial OTUs in developmental stages of B. carambolae and 2 whether bacterial OTUs were transmitted from immature stage to the adult stage.

4 Comparison of bacterial genera diversity in developmental stages of Bactrocera carambolae by principal coordinate analysis PCoA based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities indexThe present finding of Proteobacteria as the predomi- nant phylum in the newly emerged adults as well as the larval and pupal stages of B. carambolae agrees with our earlier study on field-caught adult male B. carambolae andB.

Erwinia was more abundant in the larval stage Halomonas more abundant in adult female Stenotrophomonas more abun- dant in adult male and Chryseobacterium more abundant in the larval and pupal stages.High diversity of bacterial communities in developmental stages1079Table 1 Relative abundance mean - SD and range in parenthesis of the bacterial phyla in the developmental stages with C1 in at least one specimen and exuviae of Bactrocera carambolae fruit flies determined by 16S rRNA next-generation sequencingN indicates number of replicatesFig.

The differences in the bacterial communities between developmental stages of B. carambolae indicate individual variation and some bacterial OTUs were not transmitted from the immature to the newly emerged adult flies.

The results indicate transmission of bacteria OTUs from immatures to the newly emerged adults and from exuviae to the environment.IntroductionThe carambola fruit fly Bactrocera carambolae a highly polyphagous fruit pest is one of 73 Bactrocera species that is economically important in the Pacific Region .

The dominant genera C10 mean relative abundance in the present B. carambolae are Chryseobacterium in immature stages Halomonas in larva and adult female Pseudomonas in pupa and Steno- trophomonas in larva and adult male Supplementary Table S6.As reported for B. dorsalis from China  the type and abundance of different bacterial groups varied across the life stages of B. carambolae.
