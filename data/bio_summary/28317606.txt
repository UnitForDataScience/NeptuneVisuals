These applications include i quality control of food products ensuring authenticity and provenance of material ii detection of toxicity of foods  food contaminants iii assessing metabolic response to diet at the individual and population levels iv stratification of individuals according to dietary response v identifying non-adherence to dietary interventions or plans.By exploiting thousands of measured metabolites reflecting physiological status food intake metabolism and environmental exposure the balance of traditional standardised nutritional advice can be shifted towards personalised nutritional management accounting for anindividual's unique lifestyle culture environment and phenotype.

The following section addresses some scenarios where metabolic profiling has shown to be useful in specific food and nutritional contexts with promising results.Food composition organoleptic properties and food safetyFood composition has been traditionally evaluated by the standard methods suggested by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO for the evaluation of carbohydrates proteins lipids alcohol polyols organic acids and other food energy sources 27.

The unmet need for rapid techniques for accurate and sensitive detection of food pathogens in food presents an analytical challenge particularly when metabolite patterns are required to be specific down to the level of bacterial strain and food matrix.

However newtechnologies capable of real-time metabolite profiling linked to extensive databases of bacterial profiles are on the horizon and are described in Section 3.The use of dietary biomarkers to improve the assessment of dietary intakeCollection of dietary data is generally carried out by different methods like weighed food records food frequency questionnaires food diaries and 24 hour recall methods to name but a few 59.

These techniques provide information about eating habits portion size food and nutrient consumption but these data tend to lack accuracy considering the different sources of food composition tables estimating energy nutrients and other food elements 60 61.

Newer technologies such as the rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry REIMS for direct MS-based testing of food provenance hold great promise for identifying food fraud in a matter of minutes for example detecting adulteration of beef burgers with horse meat and have potential to revolutionise the food screening industry.

Metabolic phenotyping of foods using high density data-generating technologies to profile the biochemical composition of foods meals and human samples pre and post food intake can be used to map the complex interaction between the diet and human metabolism and also to assess food quality and safety.

In addition to the complexity of food matrices the chemical composition changes during food processing 14 due to the large number of factors involved temperature pH pressure etc.

Considering the nature and diversity of compounds which are metabolized a single analytical technique is unlikely to yield a comprehensive and complete metabolic profile and frequently is used in a complementary manner.Applications in food and nutritional researchDifferent approaches have been suggested for metabolic profiling applications in food and nutritional sciences.

This type of identification is fundamental for wines vegetables fruits and specific type of foods.Protein content in food is determined by the Kjeldahl method which evaluates the amount of nitrogen in food but without the discrimination of the nitrogen source 27 29.
