CDT is involved in the severity of the diseases caused by these bacteria and many properties of this toxin support the likelihood of its involvement in cancers reviewed in Bezine et al.

2014 Fais et al.

In vivo CDT plays a key role in inflammation and promotes liver carcinogenesis in Helicobacter hepaticus- infected mice Ge et al.

2007 and intestinal carcinogenesis in 129Rag2-deficient mice Ge et al.

In vitro CDT targets the nucleus where the CdtB subunit displays DNase activity and induces DNA breaks Bezine et al.

Chronic exposure to CDT is considered to promote malignant transformation by inducing genomic instability and altering the response to DNA damage Guidi et al.

CDT intoxication leads to the formation of abnormal nuclei forming mononucleated giant cells with 4-16C DNA content arrested in G2M phase concomitantly with a decline in Cdk1 phosphorylation Peres et al.
