Of course chemotherapy immunotherapy and targeted therapy may have different effects depending on the details of those therapies and their interaction with the clones in the tumour and their ecosystem.Maley et al.Page 31Table 1Measures and assays for the factors that go into the Evo- and Eco-indicesEco-index ecological index EF5 2-2-nitro-1-H-imidazol-1-yl-N-22333-pentafluoropropyl acetamide Evo-index evolutionary index FISH fluorescence in situ hybridization FST fixation index MRI magnetic resonance imaging RNA-Seq RNA sequencing rRNA ribosomal RNA PET CT positron emission tomography and computed tomography SNP singe nucleotide polymorphism.Maley et al.Page 32An initial classification schemeTable 2Maley et al.Page 33D diversity D genetic epigenetic or phenotypic change over time Eco-index ecological index Evo-index evolutionary index H hazards R resources.

Methylglyoxal9293 nitric oxide9495 and advanced glycation end products9697 have also been implicated as toxic waste products in cancer microenvironments.Maley et al.Page 11The role of the microbiome in cancer is complicated and largely unknown.

Ecology meets cancer biology the cancer swamp promotes the lethal cancer phenotype.

There was widespread agreement at the consensus conference that both the evolutionary dynamics of the neoplastic cells themselves cancer cell intrinsic factors and the microenvironment that defines the ecology of those cells cancer cell extrinsic factors are important in predicting the future behaviour and response of a tumour.

If one tumour part a has a higher mutation rate or has been accumulating genetic alterations for a longer period of time because those cells had a common ancestor it will have a higher level of genetic divergence than another tumour part b.Maley et al.Page 29Figure 3.

For example if a tumour was below the thresholds for all four factors that is a D1D1H1R1 tumour it would be a type 1 tumour.A roadmap for improvementsWe are not yet in a position to specify which measures and thresholds should be used to determine the DD or HR type of a tumour.
