Maternal bacterial exposure in pregnancy influences the developing fetal immune system by a number of potential mecha- nisms including bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit immunoglobulin-related transplacental transport of gut bacterial components cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment and transplacental action of gut bacterial metabolites such as SCFAs.

There is clear evidence that maternal antibiotic use in pregnancy leads to altered fecal bacterial phyla reduced fecal bacterial species diversity and increased risk of offspring asthma.Summary of evidence in this section is found in .TABLe 1  evidence that maternal bacterial exposures during pregnancy are associated with immune programming and offspring asthma.

The aims of this review are to assess the current evidence regarding the influence of maternal dietary MACs and gut bacterial exposures during pregnancy on the developing fetal immune system and subsequent offspring asthma and discuss the considerations for future studies in this emerging field.PART 1evidence that Maternal Bacterial exposures during Pregnancy Are Associated with Offspring AsthmaMaternal exposure to a farming environment during pregnancy is associated with diverse bacterial experience and reduced risk of asthma in offspring .

The farm effect provides strong evidence that maternal bacterial exposure during pregnancy influences the fetal immune system and subsequent risk of offspring asthma.Prebiotic and probiotic supplementation during pregnancy may alter maternal gut bacteria and influence maternal immune function and offspring asthma.

Part 2 outlines proposed mechanisms to explain these associations including bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit immunoglobulin-related transplacental transport of gut bacterial components cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment and immune programming via metabolites produced by gut bacteria.

These include bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit immunoglobulin-related transplacental trans- port of gut bacterial components cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment and immune programming via metabolites produced by gut bacteria.
