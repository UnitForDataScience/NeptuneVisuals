the farm effect provides strong evidence that maternal bacterial exposure during pregnancy influences the fetal immune system and subsequent risk of offspring asthma.prebiotic and probiotic supplementation during pregnancy may alter maternal gut bacteria and influence maternal immune function and offspring asthma.

maternal bacterial exposure in pregnancy influences the developing fetal immune system by a number of potential mecha- nisms including bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit immunoglobulin-related transplacental transport of gut bacterial components cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment and transplacental action of gut bacterial metabolites such as scfas.

the aims of this review are to assess the current evidence regarding the influence of maternal dietary macs and gut bacterial exposures during pregnancy on the developing fetal immune system and subsequent offspring asthma and discuss the considerations for future studies in this emerging field.part 1evidence that maternal bacterial exposures during pregnancy are associated with offspring asthmamaternal exposure to a farming environment during pregnancy is associated with diverse bacterial experience and reduced risk of asthma in offspring .

an increase in intestinal mononuclear cells was observed in offspring regardless of serum igg depletion suggesting that antibody-mediated transfer is part of a group of transplacentalshort-chain fatty acidspart 3tolerogenic immune state- increased treg population and function- offspring asthmasignals responsible for fetal immune programming.fetoplacental immune alignmenttransplacental cytokine signaling promotes maternal-fetal immune alignment.

part 2 outlines proposed mechanisms to explain these associations including bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit immunoglobulin-related transplacental transport of gut bacterial components cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment and immune programming via metabolites produced by gut bacteria.

these include bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit immunoglobulin-related transplacental trans- port of gut bacterial components cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment and immune programming via metabolites produced by gut bacteria.

diet influences fecal bacterial composition with a diet high in macs associated with increased scfa-producing phyla and increased fecal scfas.scfas produced by maternal gut bacteria influence fetal immune development and offspring asthma short-chain fatty acids produced by maternal gut bacteria indirectly influence t lymphocytes to produce a tolerogenic immune environment in the offspring.

cytokine signaling appears to be another important mechanism influencing the developing fetal immune system.maternal gut bacterial metabolitestransplacental actionof gutbacterial metabolites influences many host functions including fetal immune development.

the major limitation of trials of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy is that supplementation is not commenced until late in pregnancy after a critical window of fetal immune development .

the results of a planned trial of supplementation with l. rhamnosus hn001 from the first trimester of pregnancy  may provide clearer evidence for associations between probiotic supplementation in pregnancy fetal immune development and offspring asthma.antibiotic use is associated with alterations in fecal bacteria and increased risk of asthma.

there is clear evidence that maternal antibiotic use in pregnancy leads to altered fecal bacterial phyla reduced fecal bacterial species diversity and increased risk of offspring asthma.summary of evidence in this section is found in .table 1  evidence that maternal bacterial exposures during pregnancy are associated with immune programming and offspring asthma.

in demonstrating an association between mater- nal dietary macs antenatal exposure to scfas and offspring asthma these mouse experiments have suggested a possible tar- get for interventions to reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses such as asthma however further human studies are required.other maternal dietary factors during pregnancy are associated with immune-modulating effects and offspring asthmamaternal exposure to increased vitamin d during pregnancy may influence fetal immune and lung development and reduces off- spring wheeze.

there is consistent evidence for scfa-mediated effects on the developing fetal immune system however an association has not been reported between maternal dietary macs or scfa exposure during pregnancy and offspring asthma in humans.current measures of macs gut bacterial composition scfas and offspring asthma have limitations.
