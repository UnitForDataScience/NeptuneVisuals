The improvement of the epithelial barrier function could contribute to the recov- ery of the colonic damage as it has been previously reported for other probiotics in these intestinal conditions 56 57.In order to better characterize the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of these probiotics their impact on colonic miRNA expression was evaluated and correlated to modifications in microbiota composition.It is well described that miRNAs are involved in several biological processes including development cell differentia- tion proliferation and apoptosis 7-9 furthermore it is es- timated that miRNAs may be responsible for regulating the expression of nearly one-third of the genes in the human genome 58.

The present study has compared the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of these two probiotics in the dextran sulphate sodium DSS model of mouse colitis an experimental model widely used in preclinical assays for the study of new potential treat- ments for human IBD 28.

Of note this ratio is considered as an index of the colonic oedema that appears during the inflammatory process and it is directly related to the severity of the colonic damage induced by DSS 40.Furthermore the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects ex- erted by these probiotics were confirmed when the expression of the different inflammatory markers was assessed thus re- vealing an improvement in the altered colonic immune re- sponse induced by DSS.

These beneficial effects were confirmed after macroscopic evaluation of the colon since there was a significant reduction in the weightlength ratio in probiotic-treated colitic mice inA2.01.51.00.50.0MMP-2BMMP-9543210C1.51.00.50.0MUC-2Non DSS L.fL.sNon DSS L.fL.sNon DSS L.fL.scolitic controlDMUC-31.5aaE1.5colitic controlOccludinacolitic controlFZO-11.5aa1.00.5b0.01.00.50.0cc1.0b0.50.0abbFigure 2.

We hypothesize that the beneficial effects of probiotics in intestinal inflamma- tion could depend on their modulation of miRNAs expression since they are key players in the maintenance of gut immune homeostasis 7-9 which appears compromised in intestinal inflammation 22.Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 and Lactobacillus sali-varius CECT5713 are two probiotics originally isolated from human breast milk that have been described to exert bene- ficial effects in experimental models of colitis.

It is interesting to point out that so far only a few studies have reported a correlation between the beneficial effects of probiotics and the modulation of miRNAs expres- sion although these mediators are now considered relevant in these intestinal conditions 76.In accordance with previous studies 77 78 the intesti- nal anti-inflammatory effects exerted by both probiotics were associated with amelioration of the altered gut microbiota composition observed in colitic mice.
