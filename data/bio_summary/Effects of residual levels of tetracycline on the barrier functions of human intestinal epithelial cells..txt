Additionally what experimental approaches should be used to prove if the barrier function of the intestinal epithelial layer is compromised after a single dose exposure to an antimicrobial agent needs to be determined Furthermore it is important to know if low concentrations of tetracycline residues in food have any effect on permeability and integrity related gene expression and phenotypic changes in intestinal epithelial cells.Therefore the present study examines the interaction of resid-ual levels of tetracycline exposure to intestinal epithelial cells by using an in vitro cell culture model.

This observation clearly in- dicates that tetracycline treatment in a concentration dependent manner compromised the cell integrity and barrier functionresulting in increased permeability and translocation of bacteria to the basal compartment.Effect of tetracycline on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration assayAfter formation of an epithelial monolayer a scratch was made in the center of each well to mimic cellular epithelial barrier injury and then treated with tetracycline.

In humans a healthy intestinal epithelial layers require both the properintegrity of the epithelial cells as well as a capacity of epithelial cells to proliferate and generate new cells during any assault by the external stimuli.

To test this hypothesis in vitro an intestinal epithelial cell IEC T84 cul- ture model was used to determine the effects of residual levels of tetracycline on epithelial barrier function.

To test whether the increase in transmembrane resistance caused a phenotypic change in the epithelial layer 2 106 GFP-labeled bacteriawell were added in the apical portions of the transwellsand incubated at 37 oC for 24 h. After 24 h medium was collectedfrom the basal compartment of the transwells and centrifuged to harvest any fluorescent bacteria that had migrated from the apical compartment of the basal compartment due to the compromised epithelial barrier.

Images were recorded in an EVOStm FL Cell Imaging System Life Technologies Corporation Grand Island NY.In vitro intestinal epithelial cell scratch and cell migration assayIntestinal epithelial cells were detached from the culture flask as indicated in an earlier section.

Each data point represents the means and standard deviation for three indi- vidual experiments.ResultsImpact of tetracycline on intestinal epithelial cell permeabilityTo examine the effect of tetracycline on the change in the epithelial cell permeability T84 cells were grown in transwells and incubated with 0.015 0.151.5 15 150 mgml of tetracycline.

We evaluated the mRNA expression of 84 genes involved in cell junction pathway to assess the effect of tetracycline treatment on genes that control the permeability and intestinal integrity of epithelial cells.The notch signaling pathway is highly conserved in several cell types in mammals including intestinal epithelial cells.

The epithelial cells also reinforce barrier functions by secreting anti- microbial peptides and mucins in the lumen which trap and retain both pathogenic and commensal bacteria in the mucus layer before they can reach the epithelial layer.
