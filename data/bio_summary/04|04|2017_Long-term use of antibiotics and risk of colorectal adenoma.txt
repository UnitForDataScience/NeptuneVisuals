In contrast recent antibiotic use within the past four years was not associated with risk of adenoma  ptrend0.44.Conclusions Long-term antibiotic use in early-to- middle adulthood was associated with increased risk of colorectal adenoma.INTRODUCTIONIn recent years antibiotic use has increased dramat- ically in the USA.Accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to antibiotics may be associated with risk for chronic illnesses such as IBD coeliac diseaseand obesity.

However the association between antibiotic use and risk of colorectal adenoma the precursor for the majority of colorectal cancers has not been investigated.Design We prospectively evaluated the association between antibiotic use at age 20-39 and 40-59 assessed in 2004 and recent antibiotic use assessed in 2008 with risk of subsequent colorectal adenoma among 16 642 women aged 60 enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study who underwent at least one colonoscopy through 2010.

Finally these studies are derived from prescription records which may not reflect actual use of these agents.To address these limitations we examined the association of both past and recent antibiotic use with risk of colorectal adenoma the precursor of the majority of colorectal cancers among women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study NHS which has collected detailed information on antibiotic use and lifestyle risk factors for colorectal cancer and endoscopic screen- ing practices since 2004 and prospectively documented cases of adenoma through 2010.

In addition none of the indications for Colon antibiotic use appeared to be significantly associated with risk of adenoma see online S4.DISCUSSIONIn this prospective analysis nested in a large cohort of women with well-characterised risk factors for colorectal neoplasia exposure to antibiotics earlier in life age 20-39 and 40-59 was significantly associated with an increased risk for colorectal adenoma after age 60.

Finally it is worth noting that pathogens that necessitate the use of antibiotics may induce Coloninflammation a known risk for colorectal cancer.Thus it is pos- sible that the observed link between antibiotics and adenoma may be mediated by inflammation.Strengths of our study include detailed assessment of anti- biotic use in early and middle adulthood as well as recent anti- biotic exposure and prospective follow-up to examine the influence of long-term and short-term impact of antibiotics on colorectal carcinogenesis with minimal recall bias.

Compared with non-users of antibiotics between age 20-39 and 40-59 women who used antibiotics for 15 days between both age 20 and 39 and 15 days between age 40 and 59 had a multivariable OR for adenoma of 1.73 95 CI 1.19 to 2.51 see online S3.In contrast recent antibiotic use did not appear associated with risk of colorectal adenoma.

Although no association was noted for exposure to most antibiotics 5 years before diagnosis initial use of penicil- lin 10 years prior to diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer suggesting a possible role in the earliest stage of initiation of colorectal neoplasia.A nested case-control study from the Netherlands also observed anincreased risk of colorectal cancer associated with antibiotic use within 1-6 years before diagnosis.

Women who used antibiotics for longer dur- ation were generally similar to women who did not have any antibiotic treatment in terms of family history of colorectal cancer personal diseasescreening history and lifestyle factors but were more likely to regularly use MHT and aspirin and undergo colonoscopy for symptoms eg abdominal pain diar- rhoea constipation rather than routine screening.An increasing total exposure to antibiotics at age 20-39 was significantly associated with a higher risk of colorectal adenoma.

To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to link duration of antibiotic use in a dose-dependent fashion to colorectal adenoma the primary precursor of colorectal cancer.Our results are supported by prior studies of antibiotics and risk of colorectal cancer.

We also grouped adenoma cases according to their features and subsequent likelihood of developing future advanced neoplasia high risk defined as at least one adenoma 1 cm in diameter or with advanced histology tubulovillousvillous histological fea- tures or high grade or severe dysplasia or 3 adenomas regard- less of histology or size versus low risk which included all otheradenomas size large 1 cm vs small 1 cm histology tubulovillousvillous vs tubular and multiplicity 3 vs 3.
