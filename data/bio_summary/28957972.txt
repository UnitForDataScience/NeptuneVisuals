Difficile infection are usually treated byadministering intravenous IV fidaxomicin.discontinuing the implicated antibiotic.infusing IV fluids.Typical first-line care for patients with CDI isgentamicin.b.

The authors concluded that the earlier referral occurred due tolower costs associated with treatment during Phase 2.more judicious use of antibiotics overall.the success and availability of FMT in their facility.The authors recommend that future research should seek to answer the questionIs there a best approach for instillation of fecal materialIs there a physiologic benefit of FMT in persons with CDIWhich patients are candidates for FMTGN0917Need CE STAT Visit for immediate results other CE activities and your personalized CE planner toolE2 Copyright c 2017 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and AssociatesGastroenterology Nursing
