How predictable are diet-induced changes to the gut microbiome between individ- uals and between mammalian species including humans How important is overall macronutrient intake relative to other nutritional variables like dietary additives environmental contaminants bioactive compounds and micronu- trients The number of distinct mecha- nisms by which the gut microbiome can be shaped by diet and in turn influence obesity and other diseases continues to multiply but few comparative studies have addressed the relative strength of each mechanism relative to one another.Which side of the energy balance equa- tion matters more microbial contributions to caloric intake or microbe-induced changes to host energy expenditure For that matter does the microbiome it- self expend a significant amount of energy or induce an energetic cost for host tis- sues to maintain colonizationA skeptic might argue that host-associ- ated microbial communities are irreduc- ibly complex and experimentally intrac- table that we will never have satisfying answers to these questions.

Yet part of me couldn't help but agree with the faculty member asking the question--the main source of nutri- ents for the gut microbiome is the diet so wasn't this result expected No micro- biologist would be surprised that chang- ing the in vitro cell culture medium affects bacterial growth so why is the fact that this also happens inside the body inter- esting Hadn't nearly a century passed since Arthur Kendall concluded based on his microscopic and metabolic obser- vations of stool bacteria following a die- tary intervention on monkeys that ''the nature of the diet practically determines the dominant types of intestinal bacteria'' I don't remember my exact answer probably a lot of scientific jargon about the benefits of metagenomic sequencing but perhaps a better response would have been to say ''Yes it is not at all surprising that diet impacts the gut microbiome but no one could have predicted which partic- ular bacteria would be responsive to diet or what consequence if any those changes would have for the host.''

Why did the Western diet increase the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum at the expense of the Bacteroi- detes Why were the Mollicutes some- times assigned to a distinct phylum called the Tenericutes enriched Were the observed changes in the gut microbiome solely driven by the direct impact of altering the luminal concentration of die- tary substrates required for bacterial growth Or were they due to a more com- plex series of diet-induced changes to host tissues inflammation andor micro- bial interactionsEven now nearly a decade since those results were published the microbiome field struggles to provide definitive an- swers to these questions.

The advantage of this experi- mental design was that all the mice started with a similar gut microbial community278 Cell Host  Microbe 21 March 8 2017 a 2017 Elsevier Inc.AB8006004002000DIO papers related to the microbiome DIO rodent sequence-based analyses20082010201220142016yeartransgenic mice that are resistant to diet- induced obesity exhibit similar shifts in gut microbial community structure   and weight loss induced by caloric restriction is insuffi- cient to counter-act the impact of a West- ern diet on the gut microbiome  .

Are there mechanisms by which the mi- crobiome can remember past diets and act accordingly or do microbes purely live in the moment One argument for this type of diet-driven ''hysteresis'' is that while numerous studies have shown correlations between long-term dietary intake and the gut microbiome short- term dietary interventions do not mark- edly disrupt the strong signature of individuality found in the gut microbiome .

Hooper Research Foundation University of California San Francisco 513 Parnassus Avenue San Francisco CA 94143 USACorrespondence Here I revisit our early experiments published in Cell Host  Microbe  showing that a diet rich in fat and simple sugars alters the gut microbiome in a manner that contributes to host adiposity and reflect upon the remarkable advances and remaining challenges in this field.

I had just finished giving an oral presentation on our unpublished experiments demon- strating that the consumption of a high- fat high-sugar ''Western'' diet re-shapes the murine gut microbiome potentially contributing to host adiposity  .

It is equally un- clear how many distinct molecular mecha- nisms link changes in the gut microbiome to host adiposity and whether or not they can be co-opted to improve the treatment of human obesity or other metabolic diseases.

Remarkably the colonization of germ- free mice with microbes from an obese donor resulted in significantly greater adiposity relative to a lean donor   providing the first ev- idence that differences in the murine gut microbiome are sufficient to alter host body composition.The obvious caveat was that leptin defi- ciency is rare in humans resulting in a se- vere form of obesity driven by a profound increase in appetite and decrease in en- ergy expenditure.
