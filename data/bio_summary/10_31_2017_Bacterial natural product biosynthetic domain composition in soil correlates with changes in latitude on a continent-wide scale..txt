From a practical perspective our results indicate that maximizing differences in collection-site lati- tude may provide a simple means for maximizing the biosynthetic gene cluster diversity used in future novel NP discovery efforts al- though a more in-depth analysis of additional environmental vari- ables and combinations of environmental variables from a more geographically diverse collection of soils is needed to be able to understand causative factors driving the differences in biosynthetic composition at different latitudes.MethodsAround 200 g of topsoil was collected from 397 Australian sites along with a series of environmental variables for each site.

Large-scale sequencing of environmental micro- biomes has the potential to shed light on the richness of bacterial biosynthetic diversity hidden in the environment how it varies from one environment to the next and what environmental factors corre- late with changes in biosynthetic diversity.

Due to the common ancestry of individual members within a family of gene clusters this is a good indicator of a functional relationship between an environmental gene cluster yielding an NPST and a gene cluster family of interest.

In our case however this observation appears to be biased by a general latitudinal gradient of pH change across our sample collection sites with lower-pH sites predominately found in the north and higher-pH sites predominately found in the south.

In a process similar to the use of 16S genes amplified from environments to profile bacterial species diversity bacterial biosynthetic diversity can be assessed using degenerate primers targeting conserved genes found across large NP bio- synthetic families.

In a growing number of studies individual next-generation sequencing reads NP sequence tags NPSTs derived from PCR amplicons generated using primers targeting domains in PKS or NRPS gene clusters have been used to predict the biosynthetic richness and diversity present in environ- mental metagenomes 6-12.

Unfortunately the ad hoc nature of existing domain sequencing studies has made it difficult to identify environmental features associated with differences in either bio- synthetic domain composition or richness.To more systematically identify factors that correlate with changes in biosynthetic composition we sought to assess NRPS adenylation AD domain and PKS ketosynthase KS domain diversity across a well-characterized collection of soils derived from a large and ecologically diverse land mass.

In addition to expanding the geo- graphic diversity of collection sites it will also be interesting to examine the composition and richness of NPSTs associated with a more diverse collection of common NP classes.In an effort to explain the latitudinal species richness gradient that is seen for macroorganisms a variety of ecological evolu- tionary historical and stochastic models have been proposed 24- 27.
