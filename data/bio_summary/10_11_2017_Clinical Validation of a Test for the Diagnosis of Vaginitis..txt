the investigational test provided positive or negative results for three diagnoses as follows 1 bacterial vaginosis by an algorithmic analysis of molecular dna detection of lactobacilli lactobacillus species l crispatus and l jensenii and also with bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis g vaginalis a vaginae megasphaera-1 bvab-2 2 vaginal candidiasis by molecular dna detection of a candida group c albicans candida tropicalis candida parapsilosis and candida dubliniensis or candida glabrata or candida krusei and 3 trichomoniasis by molecular dna detection of trichomonad protozoa.

all candida group strains isolated from culture and frozen were successfully detected by the investigational test when retesting the isolated strain directly.forty-three of 65 false-positive investigational test specimens were confirmed positive for candida group by a molecular amplification method.sscandida glabrata sensitivity is 40.0 25 95 ci 11.8-76.9 and 83.3 2024 95 ci 64.1-93.3 when c glabrata load was less than 2 and 2 or greater after vaginal specimen culture respectively for clinician-collected swabs.all five false-positive investigational test specimens yielded low c glabrata load by a molecular amplification method.ppositive percent agreement.negative percent agreement.seven of nine false-negative investigational test specimens were confirmed negative with the tv molecular comparator and two were positive with the tv molecular comparator.

symptomatic vaginitis accounts for millions of clinical visits annually.1 the main diagnoses are bacterial vaginosis vulvovaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.2 in a review of symptomatic women bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 22-50 vulvovaginal candidiasis in 17-39 and trichomoniasis in 4-35.3lactobacilli have predominant roles in the commensal vaginal flora by producing lactic acid.45 lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii are common lactobacilli in the vaginas of healthy women.6in bacterial vaginosis lactobacilli are decreased with increases in microorganisms such asatopobium vaginae gardnerella vaginalis mobiluncus mulieris prevotella speciesbvab-2 and megasphaera species.7-9 candida albicans is responsible for 65-90 of vaginal candida species infections and non-albicans candida species are responsible for up to 30.10-12trichomoniasis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection in the world.1 the centers for disease control and prevention recommends use of molecular tests for diagnosis.13diagnosis of vaginitis is usually made by clinical findings wet mount amsel criteria or laboratory tests.713 vaginal swab gram stain with estimates of numbers of microbial flora is an alternative method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.1415inaccurate test results are problematic for treatment efficacy carr fl thabault p levenson s friedman rh.

for bacterial vaginosis the sensitivity of the investigational test compared with the reference methods was 90.5 and the specificity was 85.8. for vaginal candidiasis the investigational test sensitivity and specificity were 90.9 and 94.1 respectively for the candida group for c glabrata sensitivity was 75.9 and the specificity was 99.7. for the detection of t vaginalis the investigational test demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 93.1 and 99.3 respectively indicating performance similar to other fda nucleic acid amplification test-cleared assays van der pol b williams ja eddleman l fuller d taylor s schwebke j et al.

three of the ten collection sites were used as laboratory sites for the investigational test and two additional reference laboratories were used for investigational and reference tests.the investigational tests were performed with the bd max system using the investigational test swabs.

overall disease prevalence as identified by the reference method and the investigational test was similar table 2. for clinician-collected swabs by reference methods bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 56.5 candida group in 31.9 c glabrata in 1.7 c krusei in 0 trichomoniasis in 8 and none of the three infections in 24 with a coinfection rate of 20. total vaginal candidiasis was diagnosed in 32.8. self-collected swabs showed very similar prevalence distributions table 2.the clinical performance of the investigational test for the detection of each organism or group of organisms is shown in table 3 which describes the performance of both clinician- and self-collected swabs as well as the contrived specimen results for c glabrata and c krusei.

for the self-collected swabs the sensitivity and specificity for bacterial vaginosis candida group c glabrata and t vaginalis was 90.7 and 84.5 92.2 and 91.9 86.7 and 99.6 and 93.2 and 99.3respectively.discussionthe investigational test is an fda-approved nucleic acid amplification test for detection of the major causes of vaginitis.

the reference methods for trichomoniasis were wet mount and culture.results--for clinician-collected swabs by reference methods bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 56.5 vaginal candidiasis in 32.8 trichomoniasis in 8 and none of the three infections in 24 with a coinfection rate of 20. the investigational test sensitivity was 90.5 95 confidence interval ci 88.3-92.2 and specificity was 85.8 95 ci 83.0-88.3 for bacterial vaginosis.

the reference methods for candida infection were isolation of any potential candida microorganisms from inoculation of two culture media chromogenic and sabouraud agar and sequencing.

the investigational test sensitivity was 90.9 95 ci 88.1-93.1 and specificity was 94.1 95 ci 92.6-95.4 for the candida group.

the investigational test swab was placed in an investigational test buffer tube to transport the specimen to the laboratory.

demographic data are shown for the 1686 participants who had a reportable reference method and reportable investigational test results for at least one target for clinician-collected swabs table 1. the prevalence of the different targets is presented table 2 for the 1471 and 1494 specimens that yielded reportable reference method and reportable investigational test results for all the targets for clinician- and self-collected swabs respectively.table 1 provides detailed demographics of the study population stratified by geographic area clinic type race and ethnicity age educational level number of sexual partners in the past year human immunodeficiency virus status types and number of symptoms use of antibiotics and antifungals.

additionally this assay potentially eliminates time to perform whiff tests and microscopic examinations for clue cells trichomonas and yeast.for t vaginalis analysis an fda-cleared amplification assay used for specimens with discordant results between the investigational test and wet preparation revealed that seven of nine investigational test false-negative specimens were also negative.

int j std aids 20152696..the investigational test provided results for a third common cause of vaginitis candida species.
