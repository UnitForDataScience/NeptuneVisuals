The investigational test provided positive or negative results for three diagnoses as follows 1 bacterial vaginosis by an algorithmic analysis of molecular DNA detection of lactobacilli Lactobacillus species L crispatus and L jensenii and also with bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis G vaginalis A vaginae Megasphaera-1 BVAB-2 2 vaginal candidiasis by molecular DNA detection of a Candida group C albicans Candida tropicalis Candida parapsilosis and Candida dubliniensis or Candida glabrata or Candida krusei and 3 trichomoniasis by molecular DNA detection of trichomonad protozoa.

Symptomatic vaginitis accounts for millions of clinical visits annually.1 The main diagnoses are bacterial vaginosis vulvovaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.2 In a review of symptomatic women bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 22-50 vulvovaginal candidiasis in 17-39 and trichomoniasis in 4-35.3Lactobacilli have predominant roles in the commensal vaginal flora by producing lactic acid.45 Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus jensenii are common lactobacilli in the vaginas of healthy women.6In bacterial vaginosis lactobacilli are decreased with increases in microorganisms such asAtopobium vaginae Gardnerella vaginalis Mobiluncus mulieris Prevotella speciesBVAB-2 and Megasphaera species.7-9 Candida albicans is responsible for 65-90 of vaginal Candida species infections and non-albicans Candida species are responsible for up to 30.10-12Trichomoniasis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection in the world.1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends use of molecular tests for diagnosis.13Diagnosis of vaginitis is usually made by clinical findings wet mount Amsel criteria or laboratory tests.713 Vaginal swab Gram stain with estimates of numbers of microbial flora is an alternative method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.1415Inaccurate test results are problematic for treatment efficacy Carr FL Thabault P Levenson S Friedman RH.

All Candida group strains isolated from culture and frozen were successfully detected by the investigational test when retesting the isolated strain directly.Forty-three of 65 false-positive investigational test specimens were confirmed positive for Candida group by a molecular amplification method.SSCandida glabrata sensitivity is 40.0 25 95 CI 11.8-76.9 and 83.3 2024 95 CI 64.1-93.3 when C glabrata load was less than 2 and 2 or greater after vaginal specimen culture respectively for clinician-collected swabs.All five false-positive investigational test specimens yielded low C glabrata load by a molecular amplification method.PPositive percent agreement.Negative percent agreement.Seven of nine false-negative investigational test specimens were confirmed negative with the TV molecular comparator and two were positive with the TV molecular comparator.

Three of the ten collection sites were used as laboratory sites for the investigational test and two additional reference laboratories were used for investigational and reference tests.The investigational tests were performed with the BD MAX System using the investigational test swabs.

The most frequently experienced symptoms were abnormal vaginal discharge 1256 74.5 and vaginal itching burning or irritation 872 51.7 with more than two thirds of participants experiencing two or more symptoms 1143 67.8.Fewer than 25 of participants were treated with either oral or vaginal antibiotics in the 30- day period before the study or with vaginal antifungals in the 14-day period before the study.

At ten clinical centers all eligible patients were recruited consecutively from clinics identified as sexually transmitted diseases human immunodeficiency virus family planning and gynecology if they reported symptoms of vaginitis at least one of the following symptoms abnormal vaginal discharge painful or frequent urination vaginal itching or burning or irritation painful or uncomfortable intercourse vaginal odor and enrolled if they provided informed consent and met the minimum age required by their institutional review board 18 at nine sites and 14 at one site.

For vaginal candidiasis the investigational test sensitivity and specificity were 90.9 and 94.1 respectively for the Candida group for C glabrata sensitivity was 75.9 and the specificity was 99.7.

For the self-collected swabs the sensitivity and specificity for bacterial vaginosis Candida group C glabrata and T vaginalis was 90.7 and 84.5 92.2 and 91.9 86.7 and 99.6 and 93.2 and 99.3respectively.DISCUSSIONThe investigational test is an FDA-approved nucleic acid amplification test for detection of the major causes of vaginitis.

The objective of the trial was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of the investigational test for vaginal swabs collected by patients self or clinicians.
