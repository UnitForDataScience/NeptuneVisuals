The H. pylori prevalence observed in this study matched those previously described for the Danish population.1827 When retested eradication was achieved in 82 of patients who initially tested positive for H. pylori which is in accordance with a previous Danish study that reported an eradication rate of 87.27 As patients are less likely to be retested if symptoms are relieved after treatment we expect similar eradication rates or even higher to be present in the remainder of H. pylori-positive patients.Interpretation of any beneficial effects of H. pylori colonization from this study is challenging as colonic diverticular disease codes cover heterogenic clinical pictures probably associated with a somewhat different etiology making the following hypothesis speculative.

Helicobacter pylori is known to be negatively associated with inflammatory bowel diseases2223 possibly achieved through higher levels of FoxP3 regulatory T cells which decrease inflammation.3132 However no known effects of H. pylori can explain our observations.Another reasonable explanation for the observed protective role of H. pylori is the possibility that H. pylori is linked to other factorsthat are important for the development of colonic diverticular disease.

It has a lower and declining prevalence in developed countries and a higher prevalence in less developed countries.18-20 In addition to increasing the risk of developing ulcers and upper GI cancers H. pylori infection has been linked to a lower incidence of numerous inflammatory dis- eases possibly protecting against them21 such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.2223Both incidence of diverticular disease and infection with H. pylori is related to socioeconomic status.

Statistical methodsThe prevalence of colonic diverticular disease was compared between patients with vs. without H. pylori infection by logistic regression adjusting for the confounding variables of gender age year of H. pylori test and country of birth Denmark reference or any other country.

People born in 1910-1920 had an H. pylori prevalence of 34 and people born in 1980-1990 had an H. pylori prevalence of 11.

The H. pylori prevalence among people born in Denmark was 13 compared with 54 among people born outside of Denmark.The median follow-up time after the initial UBT was comparable between patients who tested positive and negative for H. pylori 6.0 vs 5.9 years.

After the UBT and after H. pylori eradication this inverse association did not persist.Our study demonstrates a novel association between the absence of H. pylori infection and the registration of colonic diverticular disease diagnoses.

In the follow-up period colonic diverticular disease registrations were com- parable between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients.
