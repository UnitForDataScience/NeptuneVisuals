Compared to male counterparts female subjects had significantly higher fecal count of total bacteria P  0.009 Bifidobacterium P  0.007 and L. gasseri subgroup P  0.001 higher fecal pH P  0.001 and lower fecal concentrations of total organic acids P  0.015 succinic acid P  0.001 formicacid P  0.014 acetic acid P  0.046 and isovaleric acid P  0.033.Fecal Microbiota and Organic Acids in Relation to the Frequency of Yogurt ConsumptionThe frequency of yogurt consumption associated positively with Lactobacillus P 0.001 and Staphylococcus P 0.021 fecal counts .

Briefly significant differences were confirmed in total bacteria P 0.013 Bifidobacterium P 0.046 fecal pH P 0.007 total organic acids P 0.030 succinic acid P 0.007 and formic acid P 0.034 along with insignificant differences in L. gasseri subgroup P 0.052 acetic acid P 0.078 and isovaleric acid P 0.058 Supplementary Table 3.The GLM-based assessment of linear relation between microbiota and yogurt consumption frequency demonstrated positive associations for Lactobacillus and L. gasseri subgroup in both male and female subjects.

Among variables that otherwise did not show a linear association with yogurt frequency significant gender differences were seen in total bacteria P 0.021 C. coccoides group P 0.035 Bifidobacterium P 0.041 Enterococcus P 0.036 isovaleric acid P  0.001 and pH P  0.001 in subjects taking yogurt less than once in a week males n 93 females n 24 Supplementary Table 5.DISCUSSIONIt is not uncommon for college students to participate in gut microbiota-related studies however to our knowledge studies focusing specifically on the diet-microbiota associations in graduate students have not yet been performed.

The count of Lactobacillus was expressed as the sum of the counts of six subgroups L. casei subgroup L. gasseri subgroup L. plantarum subgroup L. reuteri subgroup L. ruminis subgroup and L. sakei subgroup and two species L. brevis and L. fermentum.Measurement of Fecal Organic Acids and pHThe fecal concentration of organic acids was determined by using methods described previously  .

Interestingly after adjusting the data for yogurt consumption females were found to have higher total bacterial P  0.013 and Bifidobacterium P  0.046 count and fecal pH P  0.007 and lower fecal concentration of total organic acids P  0.030 succinic acid P  0.007 and formic acid P  0.046 as compared to males.

While the association with L. gasseri subgroup was consistent in both male P 0.007 and female P  0.001 subjects L. casei and L. sakei subgroups showed significant correlation only in female P  0.001 and male P  0.001 subjects respectively.

When subdivided by gender the count of Enterobacteriaceae was found to be negatively correlated P 0.045 with the frequency of yogurt consumption Supplementary Table 2A.Among lactobacilli L. gasseri subgroup P  0.001 and L casei subgroup P0.005 counts had a positive association withthe frequency of yogurt consumption whereas L. sakei subgroupTABLE 2  Fecal microbiota organic acids and pH in healthy Japanese young adults n  293.

1 1-2 3-5 and 6-7 dwk were also calculated and compared  which revealed a similar trend as observed above for most of the variables in malesas well as in females thereby confirming the influence of yogurt consumption on these variables.In contrast when adjusted for gender the levels in 1 dwk category were found to be significant in case of L. casei subgroup P 0.020 and succinic acid P 0.027.

In male subjects Enterobacteriaceae Staphylococcus and L. sakei subgroup correlated negatively with yogurt consumption whereas in females L. casei subgroup and succinic acid shared a positive association with yogurt consumption  the entire results are summarized in Supplementary Table 4.

Briefly the minimum detection limit log10 cellsg feces for various bacterial clades analyzed in here were as follows 5.0 for Clostridium coccoides group Clostridium leptum subgroup Bacteroides fragilis group Bifidobacterium Atopobium cluster and Prevotella 2.4 for Clostridium perfringens Lactobacillus Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup L. reuteri subgroup L. ruminis subgroup L. plantarum subgroup L. sakei subgroup andL.
