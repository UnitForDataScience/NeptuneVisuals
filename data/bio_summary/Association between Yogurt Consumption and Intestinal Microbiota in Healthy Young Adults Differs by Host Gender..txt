1 1-2 3-5 and 6-7 dwk were also calculated and compared  which revealed a similar trend as observed above for most of the variables in malesas well as in females thereby confirming the influence of yogurt consumption on these variables.in contrast when adjusted for gender the levels in 1 dwk category were found to be significant in case of l. casei subgroup p 0.020 and succinic acid p 0.027. among variables that otherwise did not show a linear association with yogurt frequency significant gender differences were seen in total bacteria p 0.021 c. coccoides group p 0.035 bifidobacterium p 0.041 enterococcus p 0.036 isovaleric acid p  0.001 and ph p  0.001 in subjects taking yogurt less than once in a week males n 93 females n 24 supplementary table 5.discussionit is not uncommon for college students to participate in gut microbiota-related studies however to our knowledge studies focusing specifically on the diet-microbiota associations in graduate students have not yet been performed.

briefly significant differences were confirmed in total bacteria p 0.013 bifidobacterium p 0.046 fecal ph p 0.007 total organic acids p 0.030 succinic acid p 0.007 and formic acid p 0.034 along with insignificant differences in l. gasseri subgroup p 0.052 acetic acid p 0.078 and isovaleric acid p 0.058 supplementary table 3.the glm-based assessment of linear relation between microbiota and yogurt consumption frequency demonstrated positive associations for lactobacillus and l. gasseri subgroup in both male and female subjects.

interestingly after adjusting the data for yogurt consumption females were found to have higher total bacterial p  0.013 and bifidobacterium p  0.046 count and fecal ph p  0.007 and lower fecal concentration of total organic acids p  0.030 succinic acid p  0.007 and formic acid p  0.046 as compared to males.

when subdivided by gender the count of enterobacteriaceae was found to be negatively correlated p 0.045 with the frequency of yogurt consumption supplementary table 2a.among lactobacilli l. gasseri subgroup p  0.001 and l casei subgroup p0.005 counts had a positive association withthe frequency of yogurt consumption whereas l. sakei subgrouptable 2  fecal microbiota organic acids and ph in healthy japanese young adults n  293. mean - sdprevalence  microbiota log10 cellsg fecesl.

while the association with l. gasseri subgroup was consistent in both male p 0.007 and female p  0.001 subjects l. casei and l. sakei subgroups showed significant correlation only in female p  0.001 and male p  0.001 subjects respectively.

for lactobacillus the relationship was consistently significant in both male p 0.037 and female p 0.009 subjects supplementary table 2. in contrast the relationship with staphylococcus was significant only in male subjects p 0.013 supplementary tables 2ab.

the general characteristics of the subjects are summarized in .all the students had enrolled at the university and moved in the dormitory during early april 2011 and the study survey began in mid-june 2011. hence it had already been nearly 3 months since the students have experienced a major change in their life circumstances and routine.subjects were asked to provide fecal specimen and answer a questionnaire about their habitual frequency of yogurt prebiotics hereafter collectively referred to as yogurt consumption over the last 2 months by selecting one of the following four options1 1-2 3-5 or 6-7 days in a week dwk.

the results of the trend test are elaborated in supplementary tables 2ab.gender-stratified correlation between fecal microbiota and the frequency of yogurt consumptionbecause the gender influence was expected and also confirmed as described in the next section the gender-dependent differences in microbiota and organic acids were also further analyzed by adjusting for yogurt consumption .
