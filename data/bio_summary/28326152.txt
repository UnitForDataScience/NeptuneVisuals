The lactic acid produced by S. mutans can be metabolized by C. albicans  and C. albicans can increase the external pH by producing ammonia  leading to less cariogenic conditions.Interactions between C. albicans and bacteria have been studied in dual-species biofilm models.

For instance the phy- sical interaction between C. albicans and Streptococcus gordonii enhances hyphal formation of C. albicans and increases the biomass of the dual-species biofilms .

In contrast anaerobic growth conditions resulted in biofilms without visible C. albicans c.Since biofilms are three-dimensional structures it is possible that C. albicans was present yet undetect- able using CLSM.

As expected the saliva-inoculated biofilms showed no detectable pre- sence of C. albicans in all conditions d. In line with the CLSM data significant presence of C. albicans was observed in biofilms cultured in the presence of oxygen.

In conclusion C. albicans can be introduced in the AAA model for oral micro- cosm biofilms when cultured under aerobic conditions.Effect of C. albicans on phenotypes of oral biofilmsOral biofilms consist mainly of oral bacteria with fungi probably representing 0.1 of viable cells.

Red autofluorescence in RFU after curve fitting for d biofilms grown aerobically e biofilms grown aerobically5 CO2 and f biofilms grown anaerobically.were visible explaining the high standard deviations in the red fluorescence spectra d e and f.Effect of C. albicans on microbiome of early biofilmsHyphae provide sites of adhesion for many bacteria that interact with C. albicans.

This study aimed to introduce C. albicans in a microcosm in vitro model to study the effect of C. albicans on the phenotype and micro- biome of complex oral biofilms.In order to study the fundamentals of oral biofilm development one should aim to use in vitro models that mimic the oral situation as well as possible.

However this did not happen in the pre- sence of C. albicans where strict anaerobic bacteria colonized the AAA model.The presence of C. albicans did not affect the totalnumber of culturable microorganisms CFU counts in the biofilm or the pathology-related phenotypes of oral biofilms that were defined previously .

The induced red autofluorescence might therefore be an indication that C. albicans supports the growth of anaerobic bacteria in the early stage of biofilm formation.Interactions between C. albicans and bacteria can occur on physical chemical and metabolic levels .

Oxygen consumption by C. albicans is high and rapid  and the presence of C. albicans could quickly create anaerobic micro-niches.
