The widespread use of antimicrobials is now a major concern both in terms of the rapid increase in the spread of resistance to many antibiotics and also in pollution of the envir- onment with heavy metals The aim of this review is then to briefly discuss the structure and function of the adult gut mucosal immune system the process of devel- opment of mucosal immunity in the young animal and in an agricultural context factors that may drivespeed up this development process.

They may extend dendrites through the epithelium by manipulat- ing tight-cell junctions allowing direct antigen sampling and bacterial trapping they may acquire anti- gens which have crossed the epithelium intact either transcellularly or paracellularly   or they may phagocytose epithelial cells together with any environ- mental antigens which they may have acquired Following antigen acquisition mucosal dendritic cellsmigrate through afferent lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes where they can present antigen in T-cell areas  The presence of this pathway has led to ac- ceptance that the mesenteric lymph nodes are important sites for initiation or expansion of mucosal immune responses Thirdly intact antigen absorbed across the mucosal epithelium either the villi or the Peyers patches may reach the lymphatics directly and be trans- ported to the lymph nodes and ultimately into blood where it can interact with components of the systemic immune system including the spleen and distant lymph nodes Finally antigen may be released from entero- cytes in the form of 'exosomes'.

The migratory pathway requires the interaction between the ligand a4b7 expressed by mucosal lym- phocytes and the mucosal cell addressin molecule MAdCAM-1 which is expressed on vascular endothe- lium in mucosal tissues.

The Role Of Gut Microbiota In Driving The Development Of The Mucosal Immune System.

The gut mucosal immune system is therefore required not only to distinguish between microbial and dietary antigens but also between commensal and potentially pathogenic organisms.c The Authors.

The final architecture of the diffuse lymphoid tissue of the gut is not achieved until the pig is approxi- mately 6 weeks old and includes large numbers of den- dritic cells and CD4 T-cells of resting advanced memory phenotype that can transcribe IL-4 but are unable to secrete IL-2 and respond to further activation by apoptosis Antigen uptake  induction of mucosal responsesThe structure of the mucosal immune system has been extensively reviewed  and much attention has been focussed upon the role of Peyers patches and the mesenteric lymph nodes in the sampling and recognition of luminally-presented antigens.

The gut mucosal environment is complicated by both the magnitude of challenge and the complex array of antigens that are presented and the immune system that is associated with the gastrointestinal tract is required to recognise these different groups of antigens and respond appropriately.

With apologies to those who study other species much data summarised in this article will be based upon studies carried out in the pig.Architecture of the gut mucosal immune systemThe anatomy and environment within which the muco- sal immune system operates forms an integral part of its activity The mucus layer together with anti- microbial peptides such as a-defensins released by Paneth cells collectively forms the glycocalyx which traps invading micro-organisms and enables their expul- sion.

The mucosal immune system develops in a pro- grammed sequence but both phenotypically and functionally there remain significant differences from that found in adults at standard commercial wean- ing ages.
