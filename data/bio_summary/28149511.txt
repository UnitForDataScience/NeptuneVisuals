they may extend dendrites through the epithelium by manipulat- ing tight-cell junctions allowing direct antigen sampling and bacterial trapping they may acquire anti- gens which have crossed the epithelium intact either transcellularly or paracellularly   or they may phagocytose epithelial cells together with any environ- mental antigens which they may have acquired following antigen acquisition mucosal dendritic cellsmigrate through afferent lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes where they can present antigen in t-cell areas  the presence of this pathway has led to ac- ceptance that the mesenteric lymph nodes are important sites for initiation or expansion of mucosal immune responses thirdly intact antigen absorbed across the mucosal epithelium either the villi or the peyers patches may reach the lymphatics directly and be trans- ported to the lymph nodes and ultimately into blood where it can interact with components of the systemic immune system including the spleen and distant lymph nodes finally antigen may be released from entero- cytes in the form of 'exosomes'.

the migratory pathway requires the interaction between the ligand a4b7 expressed by mucosal lym- phocytes and the mucosal cell addressin molecule madcam-1 which is expressed on vascular endothe- lium in mucosal tissues.

similarly given the pivotal role that the gut microbiota play in driving mucosal immune de- velopment and the importance of maternal micro- biota refined by environmental factors in colonising the suckling infants gut it might be possible to opti- mise the transfer of selected bacterial populations through microbial colonisation and immunisation of pregnant sows during the later stages gestation and early lactation the reduced requirement for anti-microbials in thepost-weaning period would have a major public health benefit.abbreviationsapc antigen presenting cell cards caspase recruitment domainscd cluster of differentiation c-section cesarean section dgge denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis hepa high-efficiency particulate arrestanceiel intraepithelial lymphocyte ig immunoglobulin il- interleukinlps lipopolysaccharide lrrs leucine-rich repeats madcam-1 mucosal cell addressin molecule-1 mapk mitogen-activated protein kinase m-cell microfold cell mdp muramyl dipeptide mhc major histocompatibility complexmil mucosal immunology langford nbd nucleotide binding domain nlrs nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain nod-like receptorsnod nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain pamps pathogen-associated molecular patterns pca principal component analysis pigr polymeric immunogloblin receptor prrs pattern recognition receptors spf specific pathogen free t-cell thymus derived cell tir tollinterleukin il-1 receptor tlrs toll-like receptors t-regs foxp3 regulatory t cells.acknowledgementsthe authors express their appreciation to various colleagues at the university of bristol and national and international collaborators who have shared their knowledge and ideas over the many years that have led up to this review.fundingthis work was supported by grants from the eu defra  bbsrc.availability of data and materialsthis review brings together data from a large number of peer reviewed publications and it is therefore not possible to share any additional data.authors' contributionsthis manuscript was prepared by the corresponding author based upon experimental studies and joint publications carried out with prof m bailey dr m lewis  dr z christoforidou.competing intereststhe author declares that he has no competing interests.consent for publicationnot applicable.ethics approvalall animal studies were carried out under the uk animal scientific procedures act 1986.received 7 july 2016 accepted 23 december 2016referenceshelander hf fandriks l. surface area of the digestive tract - revisited.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.there is a considerable body of evidence that the im- mune system of neonates is functionally different from that of adults - the young animal is then highly dependent upon maternal passively derived immunity for their survival through this vulnerable learning period there are a number of factors that drive the development of the mucosal immune system includ- ing maternally-derived antigen and antibody mater- nal environment host genotype diet and the gut microbiome this developmental process is of pivotal importance and it has been reported that stress associ- ated with early weaning of piglets 16-18 d leads to an impaired innate mucosal immune response and in- creased susceptibility to challenge with enterotoxigenice.

the widespread use of antimicrobials is now a major concern both in terms of the rapid increase in the spread of resistance to many antibiotics and also in pollution of the envir- onment with heavy metals the aim of this review is then to briefly discuss the structure and function of the adult gut mucosal immune system the process of devel- opment of mucosal immunity in the young animal and in an agricultural context factors that may drivespeed up this development process.

below the glycocalyx is the intestinal epithelium which includes several cell types the vast majority of which are absorptive enterocytes but also includes goblet cells neuroendocrine cells and paneth cells  mucosal barrier function is central to mucosal defence and is made up of a number of elements.

the final architecture of the diffuse lymphoid tissue of the gut is not achieved until the pig is approxi- mately 6 weeks old and includes large numbers of den- dritic cells and cd4 t-cells of resting advanced memory phenotype that can transcribe il-4 but are unable to secrete il-2 and respond to further activation by apoptosis antigen uptake  induction of mucosal responsesthe structure of the mucosal immune system has been extensively reviewed  and much attention has been focussed upon the role of peyers patches and the mesenteric lymph nodes in the sampling and recognition of luminally-presented antigens.

in further contrast the venous capillary epithelium in the intestinal lamina propria of the pig expresses high levels of mhc class ii molecules and it may be that these cells release exosomes directly into blood.induction of responses and homeingthe two key reasons that underlie the need for a better understanding of mechanisms that operate at mucosal surfaces are an ability to control infections through the development of mucosal vaccines and the protection from allergic reactions to otherwise harmless antigens through the development of oral tolerance.

colonisation resulted in ex- pansion and development of the b-cell t-cell and antigen-presenting-cell compartments of the mucosal immune system  with differences in antigen- presenting cells apparent by 5 days old whilst differ- ences in t-cell compartments were not significant until 21 days old suggesting either that effects on t-cells were mediated through initial effects on antigen-presenting cells or that direct effects on cd4 t-cells require more prolonged contact with microbiota.given the evidence for the influence of early-life mi- crobial colonisation on immunological development we hypothesized that rearing piglets under different condi- tions - either low hygiene allowed to suckle from the sow or high hygiene formula fed - would affect the functional development of mucosal immunity.

consistent with dendritic cell control of t-cell function the effects on t-cells occurred at later time points and mucosal t-cells from high-hygiene isolator pigs madeless il-4 while systemic t-cells made more il-2  we recognized that within our basic model a combin- ation of factors such genetics diet stress associated from maternal separation may also be influencing ei- ther singularly or in combination with gut microbiota the development of the gut mucosal immune system.

r. stokesbackgroundthe mucosal immune system that is associated with the gastrointestinal tract is essential both for protection from enteric infection and for many of the other physio- logical roles required of the gut for the maintenance of health and development.

although a recent study has calculated that the mean total mucosal surface of the digestive tract averages 32 m2 in man approxi- mately ten fold less than earlier estimates it provides an interface that is ideal for a nutritional role but less so for preventing the entry of potential pathogens or theircorrespondence school of clinical veterinary science university of bristol langford house langford nr bristol bs40 5du ukproducts.

the gut mucosal environment is complicated by both the magnitude of challenge and the complex array of antigens that are presented and the immune system that is associated with the gastrointestinal tract is required to recognise these different groups of antigens and respond appropriately.

the gut mucosal immune system is therefore required not only to distinguish between microbial and dietary antigens but also between commensal and potentially pathogenic organisms.c the authors.
