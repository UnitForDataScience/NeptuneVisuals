These approaches are relatively cost effective and allow a description of differences in the relative abundances of bacterial taxa between study groups ie the commu- nity structure.Despite the above-mentioned limitations and con- siderable differences in their methodology and results it is encouraging that the abovementioned studies showed clear overlaps with respect to the bacterial taxa differentially abundant between PD patients and------------------------------------------------------------Correspondence to Filip Scheperjans Department of NeurologyHelsinki University Central Hospital Haartmaninkatu 4 00290 Helsinki Finland Relevant conflicts of interestfinancial disclosures F.S.
