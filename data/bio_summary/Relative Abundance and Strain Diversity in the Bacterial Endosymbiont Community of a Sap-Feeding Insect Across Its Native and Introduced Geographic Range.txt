brisbane lhi auckland sydney males sydney females and sydney nymphs 2 the population data which included only males of the four populations and 3 the sex and stage data which included only males females and nymphs from the sydney population.we calculated the relative abundance of each otu for ev- ery individual.

the latter showed that different populations of a single species harboured different microbiomes both in terms of diversity and relative abundance.in addition to their natural ranges many insect species are now found in new locations due to human activities such as global trade .

in contrast we hypothesised that m. fici from sydney brisbane and lord howe island lhi have different microbiomes likely due to the fact that they face a different climate and longer diver- gence time.

we also observed differences in relative sequence read abundance of the three main otus between m. fici populations that add insight on the colonisa- tion history of this host species.stream-lined microbiomethe three main endosymbionts recovered carsonella an un- named s-endosymbiont and wolbachia confirmed the find- ings of a previous analysis using shotgun sequencing of total genomic dna from two species of mycopsylla .

here we aimed to assess 1 whether host popu- lation structure m. fici also defines geographic structure in microbiome diversity and composition 2 the effect of a re- cent m. fici introduction event to new zealand and 3 the importance of host sex and developmental stages on bacterial symbiont communities.materials and methodsinsect sampling and 16s ribosomal dna amplicon sequencingfor this microbiome study we chose eight individual males from each of four populations which are sydney lhi and brisbane all in the natural range in australia and auckland new zealand table s1.

other studies of insect microbiomes using different regions of the 16s rdna gene and different primer sets such as the v4 region  or the v6- v7 regions  have found higher percentages 51-65 and 10-72 of carsonella reads amongst their microbial se- quences than we did here.
