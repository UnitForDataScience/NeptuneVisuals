Brisbane LHI Auckland Sydney males Sydney females and Sydney nymphs 2 the population data which included only males of the four populations and 3 the sex and stage data which included only males females and nymphs from the Sydney population.We calculated the relative abundance of each OTU for ev- ery individual.

The latter showed that different populations of a single species harboured different microbiomes both in terms of diversity and relative abundance.In addition to their natural ranges many insect species are now found in new locations due to human activities such as global trade .

In contrast we hypothesised that M. fici from Sydney Brisbane and Lord Howe Island LHI have different microbiomes likely due to the fact that they face a different climate and longer diver- gence time.

Here we aimed to assess 1 whether host popu- lation structure M. fici also defines geographic structure in microbiome diversity and composition 2 the effect of a re- cent M. fici introduction event to New Zealand and 3 the importance of host sex and developmental stages on bacterial symbiont communities.Materials and MethodsInsect Sampling and 16S Ribosomal DNA Amplicon SequencingFor this microbiome study we chose eight individual males from each of four populations which are Sydney LHI and Brisbane all in the natural range in Australia and Auckland New Zealand Table S1.

The is- land and mainland populations have likely two different strains and these could cause cytoplasmic incompatibilities between the mainland and LHI populations potentially adding an additional barrier beyond the 600 km of ocean dispersal barrier to gene flow between mainland and LHI populations and enhancing the conditions for speciation of the LHI population.Variation in relative sequence read abundanceAlthough bacterial diversity did not differ between popula- tions we found differences in relative sequence read abun- dances.

The P-endosymbiont Carsonella was acquired from a single infection event100-250 Mya followed by long-term co-speciation   as proven by the observation of co-cladogenesis be- tween host species and Carsonella .
