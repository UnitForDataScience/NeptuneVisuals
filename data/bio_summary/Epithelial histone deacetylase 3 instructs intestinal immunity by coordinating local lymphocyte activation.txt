For instance mice lacking innate lymphoid cells or IL-23IL-22 signaling quickly succumb to C. rodentium infection due to impaired barrier function and translocation of the pathogen Cella et al.Navabi et al.Page 92009 Satoh-Takayama et al.

Further while expression IFNg often associates with more severe colitis IFNg production during C. rodentium infection reduced the severity of the infection and improved clearance from the intestine Simmons et al.

Further we cannot exclude that HDAC3-dependent regulation of inflammasomes deacetylation of non-histone proteins such as those involved in NF-kB signaling or enzyme-independent processes represent additional mechanisms for how HDAC3 regulates IL-18 transcription and activation in IECs.Navabi et al.Page 10Recent studies have highlighted that commensal microbes can greatly impact how the mammalian host immune system responds to infection Abt et al.

These data suggest that the microbiota composition of HDAC3DIEC mice is not sufficient to transfer altered host defense against C. rodentium infection.HDAC3-dependent regulation of C. rodentium and intestinal IFNg occurs early during infection in a microbiota-dependent mannerTo identify the initial time point of altered pathogen dynamics in HDAC3DIEC mice the level of infection was closely monitored following original exposure.

To test whether impaired early IFNg induction in the colon may contribute to increased susceptibility of HDAC3DIEC mice to C. rodentium infection a Th1-inducing immunostimulatory oligonucleotide ISS-ODN Ciorba et al.

In addition mice lacking IL-17 exhibit increased bacterial burden prolonged infection and more severe C. rodentium induced pathology Ishigame et al.

In contrast IL-18IL-18R deficient mice as well as Casp1 and Nlrp6 deficient mice that cannot activate IL-18 exhibit a more severe DSS-induced colitis and decreased survival during C. rodentium infection Elinav et al.

The colon explant was incubated with 1x108 GFP-C. rodentium for 24 h. Longitudinal sections from the same mouse were treated with PBS or 100ngml rIL-18.Navabi et al.Page 11IEC harvest real-time PCR ELISAIECs were isolated from murine samples as described Alenghat et al.

rodentium at the site of infection at this time mice were infected with GFP-expressing C. rodentium revealing that HDAC3DIEC mice exhibited markedly elevated C. rodentium within the colon adjacent to IECs Figure 1C.Constitutive deletion of HDAC3 has the potential to alter the development of cells in the intestine.

rodentium infectionMice were infected orally with 1x109 GFP-C. rodentium Bergstrom et al.
