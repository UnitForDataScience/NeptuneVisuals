recently however an additional study could not repeat those results.in thyroid-associated orbitop- athy celiac disease is the only autoimmune disease in which symptoms and tissue transglutaminase levels usually improve if patients adhere to a gluten-free diet.in a study of the role of gluten in the induction of antiendocrine autoantibodies and organ dysfunction in adolescent patients with celiac disease at least 1 anti- body was positive in 10 of 19 untreated patients but in only 5 of 25 patients treated with gluten-free diets.a recent review described the similarities and differences between celiac disease and hashimoto thyroiditis as well as the potential gut-thyroid interrelated path- ways.the concept of a gut-thyroid relationship was supported by the fact that these 2 autoimmune diseases are related and that tissue transglutaminase antibodies were described to bind to thyroid follicles and to the ex- tracellular matrix in patients with celiac disease.

it should be stressed however that the speculation about the benefits of gluten-free diets is based on a limited number of clinical trials that investigated gluten-free diets as either a causal factor in the pathogenesis of disease or in association with the improvement of symptoms.type 1 diabetes mellitusmultiple findings suggest a connection between t1d and gluten or celiac disease shared genes coexistence of tid and celiac disease in some patients increased celiac disease prevalence in patients with t1d increased selective t-cell1052nutrition reviewsvr vol.

however since there is an increased prevalence of celiac disease in multiple autoimmune diseases and vice versa it is suggested that patients with autoimmune disease be screened for antibiodies associated with celiac disease.

these liver diseases are less prevalent than celiac hepati- tis and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality which requires they be treated with appropri- ate immunosuppressive therapy rather than just gluten-free diets.however a significantly increased proportion of patients with coexisting autoimmune hepatitis and celiac disease show sustained remission when compared with patients with autoimmune hepatitis without celiac disease.

moreover in a 2015 gallup poll 21 of americans dis- closed they tried to follow a gluten-free diet.increased frequency of autoimmune diseaseincreasing evidence demonstrates a continuous rise in the incidence of autoimmune diseases.the incidence of rheumatic endocrinological gastrointestinal and neuro- logical autoimmune diseases has increased annually at rates ranging from 3.7 to 7.1 between 1985 and 2015.these observations together with the fact that only 1 to 3 of the 30 of the general population that carries the human leukocyte antigen dq 28 allele will develop celiac disease strengthen the hypothesis that the environ- ment plays a more important role than genetics in the development of autoimmune diseases in the last decades.the increased incidence of celiac disease has been linked to increased gluten consumption.however some evidence indicates that gluten might be related to the increased incidence of other nonceliac autoimmune dis- eases.

however in celiac disease the situation is more complex since crosstalk between the host genome and members of the microbiota related to the development of celiac disease was recently observed.the precise pathomechanisms that determine how gluten impacts the intestinal ecosystem are not well un- derstood but several potential mechanisms described below have been offered.gluten-induced dysbiosis is accompanied by a breach in the tight-junction barrier and the induction of several inflammation-associated micrornas.

in a 6- month study of a gluten-free diet in individuals at high risk for t1d autoantibody levels did not change but insulin secretion was reduced.other studies did not substantiate the benefit of gluten-free diets.taken together gluten consumption may play a substantial role in the progression of t1d but additional studies are warranted to explore whether gluten withdrawal could prevent disease in susceptible individuals or be applied in newly diagnosed patients to stop or attenuate disease progression.rheumatoid arthritismultiple studies have described shared domains be- tween rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease.thusthe partial response of celiac disease-associated rheu- matic manifestations to gluten-free diets is logical.

more re- cently an increased prevalence of antibodies associated with celiac disease was found in a population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis odd ratio 5.33and 11 of that population was diagnosed as having celiac disease.

of 33 patients with psoriasis who were positive for antigliadin antibodies and were treated with a gluten-free diet 24 showed a reduction in their psoriatic severity index when compared with patients who had psoriasis and were negative for antigliadin antibodies.in another 28 patients gluten withdrawal was shown to reduce the expression of tissue transglutaminase in patients with psoriasis who were positive for antigliadin antibod- ies.several additional case reports were published in which patients with psoriasis experience rapid lesion resolution following adherence to a gluten-free diet.-there is limited evidence to suggest that gluten restriction may benefit some patients with pso- riasis but additional controlled studies in defined patient populations are needed.autoimmune hepatitis and celiac hepatitisforty percent of individuals have abnormal liver tests upon the diagnosis of celiac disease but tests will nor- malize in the majority who adhere to a gluten-free diet.celiac disease is twice as common in patients with cirrhosis as in the normal population and a gluten-free diet is known to improve liver function tests.

abnormally high levels of antiendomysial anti- bodies and high levels of tissue transglutaminase raise suspicion of celiac disease in patients with cirrhosis and may prompt physicians to recommend a gluten-free diet.several hepatic and biliary diseases are associ- ated with celiac disease autoimmune hepatitis primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis.

these findings suggest that celiac-associated autoantibodies could contribute to the progression of thyroid dysfunc- tion in celiac disease thus establishing some logical ba- sis for the beneficial effects of gluten withdrawal in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.immunoglobulin a nephropathylike other autoimmune diseases iga nephropathy shares multiple characteristics with celiac disease and several animal and human studies documented a beneficial effect of gluten-free diets in this disease.discussionthis is the first comprehensive review to address the ad- verse effects of gluten application or ingestion in vitro or in vivo and the effect of gluten-free diets in multiple autoimmune diseases t1d rheumatoid arthritis multi- ple sclerosis psoriasis autoimmune hepatitis and auto- immune thyroiditis.

the scientific and medical communities are wit- nessing a major era in which the relationship between the gut and the remote organs including the gut-brain axis is under intense investigation.the beneficial or partial response to gluten withdrawal suggests some de- gree of cause-and-effect relationship between glutenand neurological manifestations.to provide support that gluten intake may have ad- verse effects in patients with nonceliac autoimmune disease the next section describes various autoimmune diseases in which gluten-free diets had some beneficial effect.role of gluten-free diet in nonceliac autoimmune diseasessince celiac disease and many autoimmune diseases share some human leukocyte antigen genes and multiplefigure 1 autoimmune diseases that improve following gluten withdrawal.

at least in celiac disease the additive risk of subsequent autoimmune disease was decreased in patients who adhered to a gluten-free diet vs those who did not.

thyroid disease was 3- fold higher in patients with celiac disease than in con- trols.

prolonged gluten intake impairs cognitive performance in elderly patients with celiac diseasemany of whom benefit from gluten-free diets.multiple behavioral and peripheral or central neurological manifestations have been described in patients with celiac disease some of whom respond to gluten-free diets.-gluten exorphin b5 is an opioid peptide identifiedafter wheat gluten digestion.
