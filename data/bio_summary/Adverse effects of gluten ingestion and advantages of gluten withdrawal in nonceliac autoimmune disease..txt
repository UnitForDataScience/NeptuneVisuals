Recently however an additional study could not repeat those results.In thyroid-associated orbitop- athy celiac disease is the only autoimmune disease in which symptoms and tissue transglutaminase levels usually improve if patients adhere to a gluten-free diet.In a study of the role of gluten in the induction of antiendocrine autoantibodies and organ dysfunction in adolescent patients with celiac disease at least 1 anti- body was positive in 10 of 19 untreated patients but in only 5 of 25 patients treated with gluten-free diets.A recent review described the similarities and differences between celiac disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis as well as the potential gut-thyroid interrelated path- ways.The concept of a gut-thyroid relationship was supported by the fact that these 2 autoimmune diseases are related and that tissue transglutaminase antibodies were described to bind to thyroid follicles and to the ex- tracellular matrix in patients with celiac disease.

It should be stressed however that the Speculation about the benefits of gluten-free diets is based on a limited number of clinical trials that investigated gluten-free diets as either a causal factor in the pathogenesis of disease or in association with the improvement of symptoms.Type 1 diabetes mellitusMultiple findings suggest a connection between T1D and gluten or celiac disease shared genes coexistence of TID and celiac disease in some patients increased celiac disease prevalence in patients with T1D increased selective T-cell1052Nutrition ReviewsVR Vol.

These liver diseases are less prevalent than celiac hepati- tis and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality which requires they be treated with appropri- ate immunosuppressive therapy rather than just gluten-free diets.However a significantly increased proportion of patients with coexisting autoimmune hepatitis and celiac disease show sustained remission when compared with patients with autoimmune hepatitis without celiac disease.

Moreover in a 2015 Gallup poll 21 of Americans dis- closed they tried to follow a gluten-free diet.Increased frequency of autoimmune diseaseIncreasing evidence demonstrates a continuous rise in the incidence of autoimmune diseases.The incidence of rheumatic endocrinological gastrointestinal and neuro- logical autoimmune diseases has increased annually at rates ranging from 3.7 to 7.1 between 1985 and 2015.These observations together with the fact that only 1 to 3 of the 30 of the general population that carries the human leukocyte antigen DQ 28 allele will develop celiac disease strengthen the hypothesis that the environ- ment plays a more important role than genetics in the development of autoimmune diseases in the last decades.The increased incidence of celiac disease has been linked to increased gluten consumption.However some evidence indicates that gluten might be related to the increased incidence of other nonceliac autoimmune dis- eases.

However in celiac disease the situation is more complex since crosstalk between the host genome and members of the microbiota related to the development of celiac disease was recently observed.The precise pathomechanisms that determine how gluten impacts the intestinal ecosystem are not well un- derstood but several potential mechanisms described below have been offered.Gluten-induced dysbiosis is accompanied by a breach in the tight-junction barrier and the induction of several inflammation-associated microRNAs.

Prolonged gluten intake impairs cognitive performance in elderly patients with celiac diseasemany of whom benefit from gluten-free diets.Multiple behavioral and peripheral or central neurological manifestations have been described in patients with celiac disease some of whom respond to gluten-free diets.-Gluten exorphin B5 is an opioid peptide identifiedafter wheat gluten digestion.

All of these effects oc- curred in patients without celiac disease-associated hu- man leukocyte antigen haplotype suggesting a direct diabetes-specific effect of gluten.Notably the benefits of a gluten-free diet inpatients with symptomatic celiac disease and T1D are supported by the literature though it is unclear whether these benefits occur in asymptomatic patients.

In a 6- month study of a gluten-free diet in individuals at high risk for T1D autoantibody levels did not change but insulin secretion was reduced.Other studies did not substantiate the benefit of gluten-free diets.Taken together gluten consumption may play a substantial role in the progression of T1D but additional studies are warranted to explore whether gluten withdrawal could prevent disease in susceptible individuals or be applied in newly diagnosed patients to stop or attenuate disease progression.Rheumatoid arthritisMultiple studies have described shared domains be- tween rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease.Thusthe partial response of celiac disease-associated rheu- matic manifestations to gluten-free diets is logical.

Additionally there is a protective effect of gluten with- drawal on the cumulative incidence of additional auto- immune diseases in patients with celiac disease.In fact dietary modifications like gluten-free vegan diets had clinical benefits in certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis that may result from reduced immunoreactiv- ity to food antigens that are eliminated by a restrictive diet.A gluten-free vegan diet in patients with rheu- matoid arthritis drives changes that are potentially athe- roprotective and antiinflammatory.Of note human leukocyte antigen DQ28-restricted gluten-specific T cells were noticed to migrate from the enteric mucosa into peripheral blood upon gluten challenge thus indi- cating an additional mechanism of articular pathology in celiac disease and suggesting a basis for the benefit of gluten-free diets.Multiple sclerosisNumerous neurological manifestations that mimic mul- tiple sclerosis have been described in patients with ce- liac disease.A certain percentage of patients with multiple sclerosis show high levels of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies.It has been recom- mended that gluten-free diets be considered in patients who test positive for antigliadin antibodies.

More re- cently an increased prevalence of antibodies associated with celiac disease was found in a population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis odd ratio 5.33and 11 of that population was diagnosed as having celiac disease.
