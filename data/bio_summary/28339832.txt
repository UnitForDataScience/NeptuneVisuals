Pooled samples from DGGE of the 16 d sam- ples indicated randomness in banding patterns with no clustering among the treatment groups Figure A while 28 and 42 d samples exhibited increased succes- sional consistency both in the banding patterns and the brightness of the bands Figure B and C. This is also reflected in the phylogenetic tree that was gen- erated in the clustering of samples according to treat- ment there appeared to be approximately 73.5 ho- mology among samples treated with XPC T2 and T4 at the 42 d sampling age as shown in Figure C. This enhanced banding stability directly related to bird ma- turity and treatment with XPC indicates a potential effect of XPC to stabilize microbial communities in the ceca prior to 42 days.

Lanes 1 to 4 T1 Control samples lanes 5 to 8 T2 XPC samples lanes 9 to 12 T3 SAL samples and lanes 13 to 16 T4 XPC  SAL samples.

More obvious clustering among the 42 d samples in unweighted PCoA plot indicates that the number of distinct OTU rather than the OTU abun- dance is the primary driving force behind the separa- tion of samples in the graph area since the unweighted plot will not include OTU abundance when calculating distances between samples Figure A and B.Inclusion of XPC appears to allow for the micro- bial communities comprised of the entire microbiometo reach their stable levels at an earlier age prior to 42 d as is indicated by DGGE analysis however this finding was less evident in the NGS data obtained.

After filtering sequences using read quality and sample size require- ments there were a total of 280 samples 94 samples from individual birds at 16 d 92 samples from 28 d 94 samples from 42 d of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene analyzed.

The concentration of pooled samples from each plate was measured using a Qubit Fluorometer Life Tech- nologies according to the manufacturer's protocol.Quantification of the pooled samples each plate's pooled sample and all the plates' pooled samples com- bined was conducted using both the Eppendorf re- alplex Mastercycler ep gradient S Eppendorf as well as the Agilent Bioanalyzer.

The objective of the current study was to identify the impact of feeding XPC on cecal microbial populations and their relative abundances present in the poultry GIT microbiome in response to treatment with XPC andor SAL.

The birds were transferred to a grow-out facility and randomly assigned to one of 4 feed treat- ments Cocci-vaccine T1 Cocci-vaccine  XPC T2 Cocci-vaccine  SAL in the grower diet only T3 and Cocci-vaccine  SAL in the grower diet only  XPC T4.
