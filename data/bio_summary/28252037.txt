e Correlation analysis between caecal acetate levels and visceral fat accumulation plasma acetate levels and GLP-1 levels.f Correlation analysis between plasma acetate levels and visceral fat accumulation and adipocyte size.

On the other hand acetate levels showed a signif- icant negative correlation with the amount of visceral fat and adipocyte size f. These results suggested that the elevation in plasma acetate following BlaG treatment was associated with a reduction in the size of adipocytes probably through enhanced insulin sensitivity via GPR43 signalling which resulted in improved glucose tolerance and less fat accumulation.

Comparison of the BlaG treatment and Bifidobacterium longum JCM1217T BloJ treatment to improve glucose tolerance and body fat accumulation in HFD mice Experiment 2. a Blood glucose levels and the area under the curve after oral glucose challenge 2 gkg body weight after the bifidobacteria treatment for 6 weeks.

In addition colonic GLP-1 levels correlated positively with luminal acetate levels F but not with propionate or butyrate levels data not shown.

Moreover the concentration of plasma acetate correlated positively with the caecal pool of acetate but negatively with both the amount of visceral fat and adipocyte size f.Relationship between gut microbiota composition and SCFAMS-related parameters.

The abundance of Lactobacillus also correlated with caecal acetate plasma acetate and colonic GLP-1 levels r 0.67 0.42 and 0.43 respectively all P  0.01.

The level of caecal acetate correlated negatively with the amount of visceral fat but positively with plasma GLP-1 levels .

It appears unlikely that intestinal integrity microbial diversity or the BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio is involved in the anti-MS effects mediated by BlaG treatment.In conclusion B. lactis GCL2505 a highly viable and proliferative probiotic exerted anti-MS effects such as improved glucose tolerance and the suppression of visceral fat accumulation via changes in the overall bacterial structure of the gut microbiota and elevations in the levels of SCFAs especially acetate.MethodsPreparation of Bifidobacterium strains.

Neither the plasma insulin levels after glucose challenge nor the triglyceride levels were affected by BlaG or BloJ treatment in HFD-fed mice Supplementary Fig.

In the present study BlaG treatment resulted in the elevation of both plasma and caecal acetate levels 4ab in conjunction with improved glucose tolerance and less body fat accumulation.
