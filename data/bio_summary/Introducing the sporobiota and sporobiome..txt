To extend the functional analysis of the sporobiota it can be can be classified based on different levels of representation from the global sporobiota to the clinical disease-associated sporobiota of specific organisms or organ systems such as gut sporobiota Fig.

Then we summarize the major unique char- acteristics of spore-formers especially those related to human health--particularly to the gut--and discuss opportunities for future research.The sporobiota and the sporobiomeWe identified traits that allow the identification of endospore-forming bacteria as an independent func- tional group within global microbiota Table .We suggest that the collection of all spore-forming bacteria be referred to as the sporobiota.

Furthermore these studies may aid in the elucidation of the specific roles of the sporobiota and the sporobiomein horizontal gene transfer between ecological niches and their contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance.An emerging factor in characterizing the sporobiota and sporobiome independently is that due to advances in technology we now understand that the true role of endospore-forming bacteria is poorly studied because the investigation of their biodiversity remains challenging   .The traditional approaches for determining the diver- sity of spore-forming bacteria in environments and hosts are challenging due to technical and biological difficul- ties.

we identified a num- ber of previously unknown spore-formers including spe- cies isolated from the human gut associated with human pathology as representatives of the disease-associated clinical sporobiota  .We further summarize the major unique characteris- tics of spore-formers especially those related to human health.Clinical challenges related to sporobiota persistence and relapsesIn addition to recently isolated spore-forming bacteria there are several endospore-forming species associated with the human gut microbiome.
