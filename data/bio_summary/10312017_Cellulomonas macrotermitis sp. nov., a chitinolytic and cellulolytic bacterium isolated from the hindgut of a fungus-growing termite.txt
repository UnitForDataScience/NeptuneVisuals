the actinobacterial-specific 16s rrna threshold of 99.0 with 1.0 as maximum probability of error is related to dna-dna hybridization values below the 70 threshold recommended for assigning a given prokaryotic strain to a new species wayne et al.. the dna-dna hybridization values between strain an-chi-1t and its closely related species c. iranensis jcm 12410t and c. flavigena cgmcc 1.1914t were 35.4 and 23.7 respectively which are far below the recommended value of 70. these results suggested that an-chi-1t is a novel strain.taxonomic conclusionthe morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of an-chi-1t revealed by this study are consistent withits classification in the genus cellulomonas.

species of this genus have been isolated from various habitats such as the fecal flora of a healthy patient lagier et al.
