we evaluated the influence of mosapride a prokinetic agent on bt and dna fingerprints of gut microbiota in cirrhotic rats.methods a rat model of cirrhosis was set up via subcuta- neous injection of carbon tetrachloride ccl4.

in the mosapride-treated group shannon's index was remarkably increased compared to the model group.

the rest of 28 rats were randomly assigned into two groups 14 rats each group the model group and mosapride-treated group receiving gavage of saline and mosapride 3 mgkgday respectively.

at the end of the 12-weekexperiment all rats in the model group and mosapride-treated group developed cirrhosis.

the mortality was 015 0 in the control group 114 6.67 in the model group and 014 0 in the mosapride-treated group.

b-g. hematoxylin-eosin and sirius red staining indicated that the normal liver structure was severely destroyed with significant fibrous septa and cirrhotic nodules in the model group fig.
