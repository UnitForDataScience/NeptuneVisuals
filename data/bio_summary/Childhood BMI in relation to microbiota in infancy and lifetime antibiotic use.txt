In both cohorts there were also over- weight children 14 Dutch and 14 Finnish children with BMI 17 and underweight children 10 Dutch and 7 Finnish children with BMI 14.The background variables country birth weight breastfeeding duration and total lifetime antibiotic use explained 11 of the BMI variation.

3 Association between genus-like bacterial groups with infant growth from birth to 6 months and BMI at 5-6 years in the total cohort separately in the Dutch NL and Finnish Fin children and separately in children with minimal lifetime antibiotic use minAB 0-1 courses and those with several antibiotic courses maxAB 1 coursesconsistently associated with later BMI in both the Dutch and the Finnish cohort.Children with a low relative abundance of Actinobac- teria and a high relative abundance of Firmicutes at the age of 3 months were likely to attain a high BMI at the age of 5-6 years but only if they received several courses of antibiotics.

In children with low lifetime antibiotic use the early microbiota composition may be associated with the child's suscepti- bility to diet-induced overweight potentially involving leptin sensitivity or adipocyte programming In chil- dren with frequent lifetime antibiotic use BMI is likely to be influenced not only by diet but also by the antibi- otics the early-life microbiome may thus affect the child's susceptibility to both diet-induced and antibiotic- associated weight gain.To test these hypotheses we monitored a total of 162 children in the Netherlands and Finland from birth to 5-6 years of age and analysed their total faecal micro- biota at the age of 3 months using a culture- independent phylogenetic microarray.

Early growth was positively associated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes at 3 months correlation 0.21 0.03-0.39 p  0.02 particularly Clostridia 0.20 0.01-0.37 p  0.04 and species related to Strepto- coccus bovis 0.2 0.02-0.39 p  0.03.DiscussionWe compared the early-life faecal microbiota compo- sitions in two cohorts of healthy infants and identi- fied bacterial taxa whose relative abundances wereTable 2 Correlations 95 confidence interval between bacterial taxa and BMI adjusted for birth weight and duration of breastfeeding in the total cohort N  162 in children with minimal antibiotic exposure 0-1 lifetime courses N  50 and children with several antibiotic courses N  112.Fig.

In addition the models were run separately for children with minimal antibiotic exposure 0-1 lifetime courses and those with several antibiotic courses to see if the as- sociations were present regardless of antibiotic exposure.

Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus were thedominant taxa in the intestinal microbiota of both co- horts with no significant cohort difference in relative abundance p  0.09 and p  0.44 respectively.Association between early-life microbiota composition and BMI at the age of 5-6 yearsBMI distributions did not markedly differ between the cohorts see Additional file and most children were normal weight BMI 14-17 according to the CDC growth charts.

Anti- biotic use had a nearly significant positive association with BMI p  0.06.The relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria was negatively and the relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was positively associated with BMI Table Among Actinobacteria the most abundant genus Bifido- bacterium--particularly the species B. infantis B. pseu- docatenulatum B. longum and B. thermophilum--was negatively associated with BMI Table Fig.

Dutch children generally use antibi- otics less frequently than Finnish children which may explain why this association has previously not been ob- served in Finnish children.

Among the children with minimal antibiotic exposure there was a strong positive association between BMI and Bacteroi- detes particularly species related to Bacteroides ovatus Bacteroides vulgatus and Prevotella tannerae Table Fig.
