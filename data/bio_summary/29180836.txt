Far from being a simple mechanical barrier the skin constitutes a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophis- ticated skin immune system SIS as described by Bos and Kapsenberg in 1986 The cutaneous homeostasis mainte- nance is dependent on the cross-talk between several immune sentinels present in the different compartments of the skin and the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses.

The interference of S. aureus with the host's immune responses has been well described over years but remains quite dependent on themodels The host's defense against S. aureus includes i the skin barrier and outcompetition with other strains for example S. epidermidis as described previously ii the innate immune responses mostly driven by antimicrobial peptide AMP complement neutrophil and macrophage activation and iii the adaptive immune response.

These recruited cells induce reactive oxygen species ROS and nitrogen oxide species NOS production They also promote cell lysis and phago- cytosis and boost cell autonomous defenses such as apoptosis to eliminate invaders The ability of the innate immune cells to communicate with epithelial cells leading to an effective immune response is a key feature of the cutaneous immune system.

The adaptive immune system mounts a stronger antigen-specific immune response when the innate immune response fails to eliminate pathogens.

This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.IntroductionRemarkable advances have been achieved over the past years to understand and characterize the immunobiology of the skin.

S. aureus is an excellent model of bacteria being part of a semiresident flora but able to switch as a pathogen as soon as it is left uncontrolled by other members of resident flora - The coevolution of this particular microorganism with the host's SIS and its ability to get specific virulence genes easily and rapidly makes it a quite interesting target to understand how this system is dynamic.More recently there is increasing awareness of the importance of fungi and their interactions with the immune system influencing the immune homeostasis and inducing disease.

The innate immune system is designed to directly and rapidly respond to foreign pathogens by activating recognition systems and effector mechanisms Figure The major innate immune cells are macrophages dendritic cells and natural killer cells that express a wide variety of pattern recognition receptors PRR including two transmembrane proteins Toll-like receptors TLRs and C-type lectin receptors.
