Blood glucose was measured with a standard glucose meter AccuCheck Roche Basel Switzerland on blood samples collected from the tip of thetail vein.Insulin resistance indexPlasma insulin concentration was determined using an ELISA kit MercodiaUppsalaSwedenaccordingtothemanufacturer'sinstructions.Insulinresistance index was determined by multiplying the area under the curve of bothblood glucose -30 to 120 min and plasma insulin -30 and 15 min obtainedfollowing the oral glucose tolerance test 36.

These findings were mirrored by a trend in reduced leptinplasma levels in the HFD-GPE group p  0.08 versus HFD Mann-Whitney testFig 1J.The weights of liver spleen and different muscles were not affected by thedifferent diets data not shown.Effects on glucose homeostasisBoth CBE and GPE treatments significantly improved glucose tolerance asevidenced by a lower blood glucose profile compared to the untreated HFD-fedgroup Fig 2A.

In the GPE treated group several key genera that have beenpreviously found to be linked with HFD metabolic effects and gut barrierintegrity were affected we observed a decrease of Desulfovibrio Lactococcuswhereas Allobaculum and Roseburia were increased.In addition the expression of several antimicrobial peptides and tight junctionproteins was increased in response to both CBE and GPE supplementationindicating an improvement of the gut barrier function.Collectively these data suggest that CBE and GPE can ameliorate the overallmetabolic profile of mice on a high-fat diet partly by acting on the gutmicrobiota.IntroductionWith more than one third of the adult population affected worldwide obesity-associated metabolic disorders have become a major global health challenge thatextends well beyond the developed world 1.

Interestingly the gut microbiota from extract-treated micediffered from that of the HFD mice but also from that of the CT mice suggestingthat polyphenols may have specific effects on the gut microbiota Fig 6D.At the family level CBE supplementation significantly reduced the levels ofPeptococcaceae classified within the Firmicutes phylum when compared to theHFD mice Fig 6D E. Supplementation with GPE reduced the levels ofDesulfovibrionaceae and Streptococcaceae while increasing the levels ofPrevotellaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae Fig 6D E.At the genus level Peptococcus were decreased in the CBE group Fig 6F.

In theGPE treated group we observed a decrease of Desulfovibrio Clostridium sensustricto and Lactococcus whereas Allobaculum and Roseburia were increased Fig6F.Effects on intestinal barrierHFD feeding and concomitant changes in the gut microbiota are linked toalterations in the intestinal gut barrier function and in the production ofantimicrobial peptides.

However the GPE tended to besystematically lower than the other groups especially for IFNg p  002 versusHFD Mann-Whitney test.Effects on gut microbiotaWe and others have previously linked the gut microbiota with low-gradeinflammation and metabolic disorders associated with HFD feeding 17 50-52.The composition of the gut microbiota of mice that received HFD wassignificantly changed compared to those fed with CT diet with an enrichment inFirmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes Fig 6A.At the phylum level no clear differences were observed in HFD-CBE mice whencompared to HFD.
