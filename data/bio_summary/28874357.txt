these findings were mirrored by a trend in reduced leptinplasma levels in the hfd-gpe group p  0.08 versus hfd mann-whitney testfig 1j.the weights of liver spleen and different muscles were not affected by thedifferent diets data not shown.effects on glucose homeostasisboth cbe and gpe treatments significantly improved glucose tolerance asevidenced by a lower blood glucose profile compared to the untreated hfd-fedgroup fig 2a.

in the gpe treated group several key genera that have beenpreviously found to be linked with hfd metabolic effects and gut barrierintegrity were affected we observed a decrease of desulfovibrio lactococcuswhereas allobaculum and roseburia were increased.in addition the expression of several antimicrobial peptides and tight junctionproteins was increased in response to both cbe and gpe supplementationindicating an improvement of the gut barrier function.collectively these data suggest that cbe and gpe can ameliorate the overallmetabolic profile of mice on a high-fat diet partly by acting on the gutmicrobiota.introductionwith more than one third of the adult population affected worldwide obesity-associated metabolic disorders have become a major global health challenge thatextends well beyond the developed world 1. obesity is caused by a disparitybetweenenergyintakeandenergyexpenditurealthoughgeneticandenvironmental factors also influence this balance and modify metabolism 2.obesity is associated with an excess of white adipose tissue mass insulinresistance liver fat accumulation chronic pro-inflammatory state and majorhealth issues that include a plethora of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetescardiovascular diseases hypertension stroke and certain types of cancer 3.weight-reducing programs that recommend switching to a healthier lifestylewith reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity although efficientare difficult to maintain in the long term and therefore often remain unsuccessful4.

here we found that hfd lowered the gene expression ofthe antimicrobial peptide reg3g all along the intestinal tract fig 7a and data notshown for jejunum and ileum and lowered the expression of intectin encoding aprotein involved in the turnover of intestinal mucosa in the colon fig 7b andjejunum data not shown.in the colon cbe tended to increase levels of intectin fig 7b p  0.008 versushfd mann-whitney test of the antimicrobial peptides lyz1 p  0.03 fig 7fand of the tight-junction protein claudin3 p  0.03 fig 7e compared to thehfd group.

however the gpe tended to besystematically lower than the other groups especially for ifng p  002 versushfd mann-whitney test.effects on gut microbiotawe and others have previously linked the gut microbiota with low-gradeinflammation and metabolic disorders associated with hfd feeding 17 50-52.the composition of the gut microbiota of mice that received hfd wassignificantly changed compared to those fed with ct diet with an enrichment infirmicutes and a decrease in bacteroidetes fig 6a.at the phylum level no clear differences were observed in hfd-cbe mice whencompared to hfd.

interestingly some polyphenols were shownto have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties thereby influencing thehost gut microbiota and eventually the inflammatory and metabolic status 8-12. in addition we and others have demonstrated that the gut microbiotacontributes to the development of the metabolic disorders associated withobesity by modulating appetite 13 14 energy harvest and absorption 14-16gut motility intestinal barrier function inflammation 17 18 glucose and lipidmetabolism as well as hepatic and adipose tissue fat storage 19. it was alsoreported that diets containing high fat levels diminish intestinal microbialdiversity often at the expense of more beneficial bacteria 20.the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of two extracts ofplants cinnamon and grape pomace known to be rich in polyphenols in a mousemodel of diet-induced obesity.

our data are consistent with previous reports that showed664moderate but significant beneficial effect of table grape extracts on adiposity665hepatic steatosis insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation 28 30 60-66663.we also found a clear improvement of glucose homeostasis by both extracts asevidenced by an improved glucose tolerance and lower insulin resistance index.this was associated with a marked reduction of non-esterified fatty acidsnefas free fatty acids which have previously been found to be modulators ofinsulin sensitivity 64. interestingly although improvement of insulin resistanceindex was achieved by both grape and cinnamon extracts the mechanismsbehind this seem to be different.

it hasbeen proposed that cinnamon facilitates glucose entrance into cells by inducingglucose transporter 4 glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane mediatedby the lkb1-ampk signalling pathway 65 66 whereas grapes might activatethe pi3k pathway and promote insulin action by reducing serine kinaseactivation and cytokine signaling 67. our data thus suggest that both extractsmight be useful additives in the management of glucose homeostasis in diabeticpatients as has been proposed previously 21 23-25 27.a large fraction of dietary polyphenols reaches the colon and can be metabolizedby the intestinal microbiota.

in thegpe treated group we observed a decrease of desulfovibrio clostridium sensustricto and lactococcus whereas allobaculum and roseburia were increased fig6f.effects on intestinal barrierhfd feeding and concomitant changes in the gut microbiota are linked toalterations in the intestinal gut barrier function and in the production ofantimicrobial peptides.
