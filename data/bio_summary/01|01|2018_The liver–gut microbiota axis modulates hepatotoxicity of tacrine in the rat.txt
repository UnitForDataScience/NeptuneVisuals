Fractional abundance of a Bacteroides b Enterobacteriaceae and c Lactobacillus in the StrR group and the NonR group at four different time periods as coded in the legend of panel a. d Heat map of log2fold change of the upper quartile normalized read counts of the bacterial genera between StrR versus NonR.

At the peak of transaminitis 8-24 hours the StrR were found to form a distinct cluster from the rest of the rats .To screen for transaminitis-related metabolites wecompared the metabolomes of the StrR with the NonR during the peak of transaminitis 8-24 hours.Our analysis uncovered 43 unique urinary marker metabolites and 62 unique fecal metabolites associated with tacrine-induced transaminitis variable impor- tance in the projection  1 andor P  0.05 r  0.6 Fig.

b Plasma AST levels of individual LH rats in the control group n 5 12 NonR n 5 16 MilR n 5 3 ModR n 5 3 and StrR n 5 4. c Plasma tacrine concentration-time profile following an acute oral dose of 20 mg  kg21 of tacrine in the four toxicity pheno- types and the four rats in the StrR group.

For panels a-c n 5 4 for StrR at all time peri- ods n 5 16 for NonR before dos- ing and at 8-24 hours and n 5 6 for NonR at 0-8 hours and 72-96 hours.

Through a longitudinal temporal pharmacokinetics study we observed for the first time the occurrence of double-Cmax profile of tacrine in plasma of StrR which is characteristic of enterohepatic recycling.2627 Taken together higher systemic expo- sure of tacrine in StrR correlated with the hepatotoxic outcome.

Tacrine and OH-THA were quantitated using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry inthe feces of four StrR T8 T10 T12 and T14 and six NonR rats T1 T2 T11 T16 T18 and T27 col- lected over 0-8 and 8-24 hours.

Differential abundance testing StrR versus NonR group was performed using the webtool EDDA version 1.4.0  upper- quartile normalization cuffdiff mode.23Metaphlan24 default parameters was used to pro- file community abundance at the genus level.

Differen- tial abundance testing StrR versus NonR was performed with the webtool EDDA version 1.4.0 upper-quartile normalization cuffdiff mode23 using the mapped clade-specific genus reads produced by metaphlan.

An false discovery rate FDR cutoff  0.05 was used to filter for significant differentially abundant genera StrR versus NonR.

Based on the severity of transaminitis 10 tacrine-dosed rats with ele- vation of AST 33 mean of controls were classified as StrR elevations over 3 time points n 5 4 ModR elevations over 2 time points n 5 3 or MilR eleva- tions over 1 time point n 5 3 while 16 rats with AST33 mean of controls were classified as NonR to reflect the graded responses.
