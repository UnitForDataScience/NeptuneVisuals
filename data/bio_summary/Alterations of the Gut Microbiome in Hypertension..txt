However the identification and functional status of the hypertension-related gut microbes have not yet been surveyed in a comprehensive manner.Methods Here we characterized the gut microbiome in hypertension status by comparing fecal samples of 60 patients with primary hypertension and 60 gender- age- and body weight-matched healthy controls based on whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing.Results Hypertension implicated a remarkable gut dysbiosis with significant reduction in within-sample diversity and shift in microbial composition.

These findings demonstrated considerable gut microbial dysbiosis in hypertensive patients.Identification of Hypertension-Associated Markers from Gut MicrobiomeTo explore signatures of the gut microbiome in hypertensive patients and controls we integrated the sequencing data into an existing gut microbial reference gene catalog to obtain a set of5.3 million genes which allowed for saturation mapping of the reads 80.3.

We further provided the microbial markers for disease discrimination and achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve AUC of 0.78 demonstrating the potential of gut microbiota in prediction of hypertension.Conclusion These findings represent specific alterations in microbial diversity genes species and functions of the hypertensive gut microbiome.

Further studies on the causality relationship between hypertension and gut microbiota will offer new prospects for treating and preventing the hypertension and its associated diseases.Keywords hypertension gut microbiome microbial dysbiosis metagenome-wide association studyINTRODUCTIONHypertension is a global public health problem.

In addition the gut microbial enzymes involved in TMA production were enriched in the hypertensive patients compared to controls whereas the SCFA-producing enzymes were depleted Figure 3B.Gut Microbiota-Based Classification of HypertensionWe evaluated the performance of gut microbiota composition to identify hypertension status in the MLG profiles using the Random Forest model and obtained the discriminatory power of the area under the ROC curve AUC of 0.78 95 CI 0.73-0.82 Figure 4A.

These findings suggested that the dietary choline intake and TMAO production via gut microflora would be a probable pathway for hypertensive pathogenesis.Klebsiella is a pathogen routinely found in human gut that causes pneumonia diarrhea and urinary tract infection.

2011 suggesting that low level of SCFA production in gut microbiota may be a considerable risk factor of multiple metabolic syndromes and hypertension.Several other bacteria also played important function in human gut and showed potential function in hypertension such as the patient-enriched Bacteroides including B. eggerthiiB.

7381. doi Introduction Human gut microbiota is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension.

and Parabacteroides merdae were frequently distributed in hypertensive gut microbiome whereas the short-chain fatty acid producer such as Roseburia spp.

Functionally the hypertensive gut microbiome exhibited higher membrane transport lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and steroid degradation while in controls the metabolism of amino acid cofactors and vitamins was found to be higher.
