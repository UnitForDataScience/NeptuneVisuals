gut microbiome-induced changes in lipid metabolism are associated with intestinal inflammationand gut microbiota-dependent formation of die- tary trimethylamine tma is linked with atherosclerosis.in this context building on our previous inhalation study in which ufp exposure promoted inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism in both the gastrointestinal and vascular systems we hereby tested the hypoth- esis that oral ufp ingestion altered gut microbiota to promote intestinal and serum pro-inflammatory media- tors and atherogenic lipid metabolites in ldlr-null mice.

for this reason we sought to study the role of ufp ingestion on gut microbiota in ldlr-null mice to alter lipid metabolism and atherogenic lipid metabolites.the gut of human and many other vertebrates is mostly dominated by two phyla of bacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes.

we hypothesized that orally ingested ufp promoted atherogenic lipid metabolites in both the intestine and plasma via altered gut microbiota composition.
