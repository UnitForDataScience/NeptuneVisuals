the identifi- cation of the mosquitoes was performed on morphological bases and confirmed by sequencing of the ribosomal gene region its2 according to bachellerie and qu 1993.isolation and identification of yeasts from the reared mosquitoes and insectary water samplesthe fungal community present in the gut of adult female mosquitoes was screened in five laboratory reared spe- cies by a culture-dependent method.

three types of water were analysed i spring water before exposure to the insec- tary environment ii breeding water after 5-6 days exposure in presence of sterile food iii larval water after 5-6 days exposure in presence of sterile food and an.

three water samples were analysed i spring water before exposure at the insectary ii breeding water after 5-6 days exposure at rearing conditions in presence of sterile larval food and iii larval water after 5-6 days exposure at rearing conditions in presence of sterile larval food and an.

the literature describes these fungi as pathogens of clinical signifi- cance and suggests that their metabolic andor antimi- crobial features may indicate a possible symbiotic function in insects.considering the wide diffusion of the yeasts isolated in the mosquitoes the rearing water used at insectary was analysed to evaluate which fungi could be detected in the mosquito gut as environmental contaminants.

2009.since the insectary environment may impart its own microbes to the mosquitoes the water samples used for rearing were also examined.

2012 it can arrive through the spring water used to raise the mosquitoes.
