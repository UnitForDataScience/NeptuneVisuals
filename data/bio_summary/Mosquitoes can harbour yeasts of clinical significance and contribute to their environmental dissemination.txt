Three different water samples were filtered and analysed i 500 ml of spring water freshly collected ii 500 ml of breeding water spring water with sterile mouse food after 2 days expo- sure to the insectary conditions and iii 500 ml of larval water breeding water after 5-6 days exposure to the insectary conditions and containing the larval stages of An.

The identifi- cation of the mosquitoes was performed on morphological bases and confirmed by sequencing of the ribosomal gene region ITS2 according to Bachellerie and Qu 1993.Isolation and identification of yeasts from the reared mosquitoes and insectary water samplesThe fungal community present in the gut of adult female mosquitoes was screened in five laboratory reared spe- cies by a culture-dependent method.

Three types of water were analysed i spring water before exposure to the insec- tary environment ii breeding water after 5-6 days exposure in presence of sterile food iii larval water after 5-6 days exposure in presence of sterile food and An.

Three water samples were analysed i spring water before exposure at the insectary ii breeding water after 5-6 days exposure at rearing conditions in presence of sterile larval food and iii larval water after 5-6 days exposure at rearing conditions in presence of sterile larval food and An.

The mosquitoes were reared and processed for the dis- section of organs in sterile conditions as previously described.Concerning wild mosquitoes a total of 274 field- collected samples were tested.

The literature describes these fungi as pathogens of clinical signifi- cance and suggests that their metabolic andor antimi- crobial features may indicate a possible symbiotic function in insects.Considering the wide diffusion of the yeasts isolated in the mosquitoes the rearing water used at insectary was analysed to evaluate which fungi could be detected in the mosquito gut as environmental contaminants.

One hundred isolates were obtained spring water 30 breeding water 30 and lar- val water 40.
