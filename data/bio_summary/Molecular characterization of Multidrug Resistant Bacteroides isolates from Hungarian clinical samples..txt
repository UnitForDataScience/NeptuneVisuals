Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region QRDR of the DNA gyrase gyrA and gyrB andor topoisomerase IV parC and parE gyrase genes as well as increased efflux due to the multi- antimicrobial extrusion MATE family protein encoded by the bexA gene may result in fluoroquinolone resistance .In a recent Hungarian antibiotic resistance survey six multi- drug-resistant MDR Bacteroides isolates were identified and are the focus of this study.MethodsBacterial strains and cultivationIn this study 400 Bacteroides isolates collected from clinically relevant samples by five Hungarian clinical microbiology centres between January 2014 and March 2016 were investigated.

The clinical data of patients who were infected by MDR Bacteroides isolates as well as the isolate MICs are summarised in .Table 2PCR parameters for the genes and genetic elements examined.Real-Time PCR RT-PCRMolecular investigations of the MDR isolates were carried out in order to detect most common antibiotic resistance genes cepA cfxA cfiA nim ermB ermF ermG tetQ tetX tetX1 and bexA IS4351 and the upstream region of the cfiA and cfxA genes.

Tigecycline and chloramphenicol were very active against these isolates all of them being susceptible to these two drugs.DiscussionTo date MDR Bacteroides isolates have been rarely reported.

Due to frequent use of antibiotics the spread of multidrug-resistant MDR strains is a real threat worldwide.Methods In a multicentre study 400 Bacteroides isolates from five Hungarian microbiology laboratories were cultured and were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorptionionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOFMS.

Among the six MDR isolates one cfiA- two cepA- three cfxA- two ermG- six tetQ- three tetX- and two bexA-positive strains were found.

None of the MDR isolates harboured cepA nim ermB or tetX1 genes.

Within a comprehensive multicentre survey we demonstrated the relatively high prevalence of MDR strains isolated in one centre with five isolates as well as one isolate from another centre during a relatively short period of time.

Bacteroides fragilis can cause intra- abdominal and skin and soft-tissue infections as well as diarrhoea caused by enterotoxin-producing B. fragilis isolates particularly inyoung children below 5 years of age .
