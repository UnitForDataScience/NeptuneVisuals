The change in physiology after bariatric surgery may also promote a different composition in the gut microbiota but the microbiota alone may not be the primary driver of weight loss after bypass surgery.The Gut Microbiota Inflammation and DiabetesAccumulating evidence in animal models and in humans shows that obesity and T2D are associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota.

J Nutr 2017147Suppl1468S-75S.Keywords microbiota diet yogurt type 2 diabetes inflammation environmentIntroductionThe gut microbiota is a complex community of bacteria residing in the intestine.

Given that 80 of patients with T2D are overweight in the West and that obesity and T2D are charac- terized by an altered gut microbiota inflammation and gut barrier disruption it is conceivable that the microbiota may play a role in the development of these conditions 14 22.The immune system is ''educated'' and matured by commen- sal bacteria especially bacteria in the gut.

Although the metagenomic markers of microbiota in Chinese and European cohorts are different it is clear that the gut microbiota closely correlates to T2D.

Family members have been found to have more similar microbiota communities than unrelated individ- uals and the gut microbiota is more similar in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins 15.

It is possible that an altered gut microbiota may be the cause of the drug's common side effect in the digestive system and the altered gut microbiota is also likely to influence the drug's antidiabetic efficacy.Diet.

Yogurt and Type 2 Diabetes Translating Evidence into PracticeFactors Influencing the Gut Microbiota Inflammation and Type 2 DiabetesLi Wen1 and Andrew Duffy21Section of Endocrinology and 2Department of Surgery Yale University School of Medicine New Haven CTAbstractThe gut microbiota is a complex community of bacteria residing in the intestine.

Animal models have demonstrated that several factors contribute to and can significantly alter the composition of the gut microbiota including genetics the mode of delivery at birth the method of infant feeding the use of medications especially antibiotics and the diet.

There may exist a gut microbiota signature that promotes intestinal inflammation and subsequent systemic low-grade inflammation which in turn promotes the development of type 2 diabetes.

It is well known that diet including yogurt consump- tion has a direct impact on the gut bacteria therefore it is possible that the effect of yogurt on energy balance and body weight control in some studies is mediated by the alteration of the gut microbiota.
