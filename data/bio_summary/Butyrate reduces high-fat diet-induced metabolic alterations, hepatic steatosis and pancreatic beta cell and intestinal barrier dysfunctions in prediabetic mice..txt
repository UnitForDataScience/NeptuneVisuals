the central feature of the t2dm is the development of a body resistance to insulin that is characterized by a reduction in tissue responsesen- sitivity particularly of muscle adipose and hepatic tissues to this hormone and as consequence a chronic state of hyperglycemia develops.6-844 it has been recently sug- gested that consumption of lipid-enriched diet results in disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier allowing the passage of noxious agents leading in turn to a systemic inflammatory response that could be a primary cause of the peripheral insulin resistance.122224-2845 recent works have focused on changes in microbiota and in luminal con- tent composition as a result of hf diet consumption and its relation to intestinal barrier disruption localsystemic immune response andor insulin resistance state in t1dm and t2dm diabetes.1246-48 these studies have opened a new perspective of investigation aiming at the use of pro- biotics prebiotics and postbiotics such as scfas as adjunctive therapy of diabetes.242829313849 some studies have demonstrated that sodium butyrate a scfa has bene- ficial effects on animal models of t1dm and t2dm.313639 in the present work we demonstrated that butyrate alleviates the metabolic impairments induced by hf diet administra- tion in mice by inhibiting the development of an insulin resistance state which was associated with improvement of insulin-secreting function of beta cells and strengthening of the tj-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier.confirming our previous works192041 we described herein that the exposure to a diet with high content of lipids 21 ww corresponding to 45 of fat in calories for only 60 days induced in c57 mice obesity and predia- betes which were characterized by a significant body adiposity marked insulin resistance associated with moderate hyperglycemia and significant hyperinsulinemia.

this change resulted in a significantly higher p 14 0.012 fold increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion in hfb islets 56.5 - 18.8 10 fold as compared to basal secretion than hf islets 10.5 - 3.4 13 fold as compared to basal secretion which in turn displayed a significant lower p 14 0.02 secretory response to glucose as compared to con- trol c islets 32.4 - 7.9 14 fold as compared to basal secretion.in accordance with our previous data192041 60 days of exposure to hf diet induced a compensatory beta cell mass expansion as revealed by the significant increase in the rela- tive volume of beta cells in relation to the total pancreas figure 3b and e as compared to controls figure 3a and e. this was accompanied by no changes in islet cyto- architecture characterized by a core of insulin-secreting beta cells surrounded by a peripheral mantle of glucagon- secreting alpha cells in hf mice which was verified in all other experimental groups c cb hfb figure 3f to i. interestingly the compensatory beta cell mass expansion was not observed in the groups that received supplemen- tation with sodium butyrate hfb and cb figure 3c to e.considering the protective effect of sodium butyrate against the hf diet-induced adiposity and disturbance of the beta cell insulin secretion we also evaluated the degree of lipid accumulation in the liver and adipocyte infiltrationfigure 1 butyrate treatment significantly reduced the high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in mice without changing food intake.

no evidence of hepatic lipid accumulation was observed in the control groups receivingor not butyrate c and cb figure 4a and c. in addition adipocyte infiltration was observed in the pancreas of ani- mals exposed to hf diet figure 4g and j as compared to the c group figure 4f and j. in hf diet-fed mice that received diet supplementation with sodium butyrate there was a significant decrease in the intrapancreatic deposition of adipose tissue figure 4i and j as well as a reduction in adipocyte size as compared to the pancreas from hf group figure 4g and j. in contrast the amount of intra- pancreatic adipose tissue was negligible in the control groups c and cb figure 4f h and j.considering the protective effect of butyrate on the meta- bolic parameters studied as well as on the reduction of thefigure 2 pancreatic islets from high fat-fed mice show altered insulin secretion that was not observed after treatment with butyrate.

compared to controls c islets from hf-fed mice hf showed increased basal insulin secretion expressed as ng.ml-1.islet-1 in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose g 2.8 but a comparable insulin release when stimulated by16.7 mm glucose g 16.7 b. this increased basal secretion was not observed in hf-fed mice receiving diet supplementation with butyrate hfb as compared to its control cba but a tendency of an increase in stimulated insulin release b was verified in mice with butyrate diet supplementation cb and hfd groups as compared to those not receiving this scfa c and hf groups.

in previous works we have shown that the increased beta cell mass resulted from beta-cell hypertrophy as well as from self-replication of this cell type as revealed by ki67 immunodetection a marker of cell proliferation.1920 in addition oliveira et al.19 showed that there is a direct correlation between the degree of beta cell mass expansion and the level of hyperglycemia mainly at fed state and insulin resistance in hf diet-fed mice where the former parameter displayed a higher correlation index r 14 0.929 than the latter as assessed by itt r 14 0.817. in the present study we reported that butyrate treatment significantly reduced the hf diet-induced increase in beta cell mass which is in line with our findings showing a marked inhibitory effect of this scfa on postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance state that was completely blocked.besides the endocrine pancreas the intestinal tract and the associated microbiota have been considered as a pivotal organ for the onset and evolution of both t1dm and t2dm.2225455960 based on clinical and experimental evi- dence the current hypothesis postulates that a disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier induced by a modified microbiota or altered luminal content would lead to an increased intestinal permeability to antigens from dietary viral or bacterial origin that in turn could activate auto- immune reactions against insulin-producing beta cells in t1dm andor elicit secretion of pro-inflammatory cyto- kines locally and systemically leading to insulin resistance in t2dm.14486162 given our current knowledge one may assume that reinforcing the intestinal barrier can offer and open new therapeutic horizons in the treatment of these two types of diabetes.

the evaluation of the intestinal epithelial barrier by claudin-1 immunodetection in intestinal cryosections showed a significant decrease in the intercellular content of this tj-associated protein in enterocytes of hf-fed mice in all studied intestinal segments jejunum reduction of 26.4 figure 5c and e ileum of 25.6 figure 5c and e and colon of 19.4 figure 6c and e as com- pared to that observed in the c group suggesting an impairment of the structure of the intestinal epithelial bar- rier after hf diet treatment.

in addition we showed that butyrate treatment per se did not affect markedly body weight and metabolic parameters in mice fed a regular diet indicating that this scfa acts mainly when animal metabolism is challenged by a modified diet.one of the consequences of consumption of hf diet is the development of a fatty liver a condition known as hepatic steatosis.50 hepatic steatosis is closely related to obesity insulin resistance state and t2dm and although it is reversible can aggravate the metabolic disturbances associated with these disorders or evolved to a more ser- ious condition known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitisfigure 6 butyrate inhibited the reduction in the junctional content of claudin-1 in enterocytes of the large intestine colon induced by exposure to the high-fat diet in mice.

in addition the food consumption in grams was similar among the different treatments c 6.04 - 0.16 g hf 6.35 - 0.08 g cb 5.19 - 0.18 g hfb 6.05 - 0.09 g n 14 18.it is well known that the insulin resistance state in t2dm can result in structural adaptations of the endocrine pan- creas and functional defects in the insulin-secreting pancre- atic beta cells.15-19 to investigate whether supplementation with sodium butyrate has also an effect on insulin secretion batches of isolated pancreatic islets from mice of all experi- mental groups were in vitro exposed to 2.8 mm or 16.7 mm glucose for 60 min figure 2. at basal condition 2.8 mm glucose islets isolated from mice of the hf group showed a significant increase in basal insulin release as compared to control group figure 2a which is in agree- ment with our previous data.2041 interestingly this increased basal secretion was not observed in islets from mice receiving diet supplementation with butyrate hfb group figure 2a.

taken this into consideration the fact that butyrate-treated mice displayed significant lower adipose tissue infiltration within pancreas parenchyma after hf diet exposure as compared to hf mice may be another contributing factor.our prediabetic mice also displayed a significant beta cell mass expansion which was not accompanied by changes in islet cytoarchitecture as compared to control animals.

animals from the hf group received a prepared hf diet in powder containing 21 lipids 50 carbohydrates and 20 proteins ww while the hfb group received the same hf diet but mixed with 5 of sodium butyrate ww.

butyrate treatment blocked completely the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia states induced by hf diet figure 1d and g. mice from hfb group displayed a significant decrease of 50.5 in body weight gain 27.7 in adipose tissue accumulation and 19.7 and 15.9 in fast and fed hyperglycemia respectively as compared to those from hf group figure 1. in addition butyrate per se cb group has no adverse effects on theparameters evaluated as compared to the control group figure 1.in order to confirm that the protective effect of sodium butyrate on the parameters studied was not a result of dif- ferences in diet ingestion we have monitored the daily food consumption in all experimental groups throughout the experimental procedure.

firstly as revealed by morphometric analysis we showed that 60 days of exposure to hf diet resulted in the appearance of lipid-containing hepatocytes represent- ing approximately 21 of total liver volume that typicallycharacterizes a hepatic steatosis state clinically defined as the accumulation of lipids in at least 5 of hepatocytes.51 interestingly the diet supplementation with butyrate reduced significantly the hepatic steatosis in hf diet-fed mice by decreasing not only the number of hepatocytes affected to only 11 of total liver volume but also thesize and frequency of cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

taken all into consideration we went to investigate the effect of butyrate supplementation on intes- tinal barrier function in our animal model of t2dmfocusing on the structure and function of the intestinal tj an essential element of this barrier.62-65exposure to hf diet for 60 days induced a significant decrease in the junctional content of claudin-1 a constitu- tive protein of intestinal tj63 and a tendency of reduction in total protein content of this protein in the epithelium of intestinal segments jejunum ileum and colon as revealed by immunohistochemistry and western blot respectively.
