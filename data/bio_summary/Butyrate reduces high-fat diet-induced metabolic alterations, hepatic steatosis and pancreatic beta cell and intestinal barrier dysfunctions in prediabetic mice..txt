The evaluation of the intestinal epithelial barrier by claudin-1 immunodetection in intestinal cryosections showed a significant decrease in the intercellular content of this TJ-associated protein in enterocytes of HF-fed mice in all studied intestinal segments jejunum reduction of 26.4 Figure 5c and e ileum of 25.6 Figure 5c and e and colon of 19.4 Figure 6c and e as com- pared to that observed in the C group suggesting an impairment of the structure of the intestinal epithelial bar- rier after HF diet treatment.

The central feature of the T2DM is the development of a body resistance to insulin that is characterized by a reduction in tissue responsesen- sitivity particularly of muscle adipose and hepatic tissues to this hormone and as consequence a chronic state of hyperglycemia develops.6-844 It has been recently sug- gested that consumption of lipid-enriched diet results in disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier allowing the passage of noxious agents leading in turn to a systemic inflammatory response that could be a primary cause of the peripheral insulin resistance.122224-2845 Recent works have focused on changes in microbiota and in luminal con- tent composition as a result of HF diet consumption and its relation to intestinal barrier disruption localsystemic immune response andor insulin resistance state in T1DM and T2DM diabetes.1246-48 These studies have opened a new perspective of investigation aiming at the use of pro- biotics prebiotics and postbiotics such as SCFAs as adjunctive therapy of diabetes.242829313849 Some studies have demonstrated that sodium butyrate a SCFA has bene- ficial effects on animal models of T1DM and T2DM.313639 In the present work we demonstrated that butyrate alleviates the metabolic impairments induced by HF diet administra- tion in mice by inhibiting the development of an insulin resistance state which was associated with improvement of insulin-secreting function of beta cells and strengthening of the TJ-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier.Confirming our previous works192041 we described herein that the exposure to a diet with high content of lipids 21 ww corresponding to 45 of fat in calories for only 60 days induced in C57 mice obesity and predia- betes which were characterized by a significant body adiposity marked insulin resistance associated with moderate hyperglycemia and significant hyperinsulinemia.

In the present study we reported that butyrate treatment significantly reduced the HF diet-induced increase in beta cell mass which is in line with our findings showing a marked inhibitory effect of this SCFA on postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance state that was completely blocked.Besides the endocrine pancreas the intestinal tract and the associated microbiota have been considered as a pivotal organ for the onset and evolution of both T1DM and T2DM.2225455960 Based on clinical and experimental evi- dence the current hypothesis postulates that a disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier induced by a modified microbiota or altered luminal content would lead to an increased intestinal permeability to antigens from dietary viral or bacterial origin that in turn could activate auto- immune reactions against insulin-producing beta cells in T1DM andor elicit secretion of pro-inflammatory cyto- kines locally and systemically leading to insulin resistance in T2DM.14486162 Given our current knowledge one may assume that reinforcing the intestinal barrier can offer and open new therapeutic horizons in the treatment of these two types of diabetes.

Email AbstractIn this study we investigated the effect of diet supplementation with sodium butyrate 5 ww a short-chain fatty acid produced by the intestinal microbiota on metabolic parameters body adiposity hepatic and pancreatic lipid accumulation beta cell functionmass as well as on the structure and function of the tight junction-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier in both normal and obeseprediabetic C57 mice fed a regular control or high-fat diet for 60 days respectively.

Butyrate enhanced the intestinal epithelial barrier as revealed by the FITC-Dextran permeability assay which was accompanied by a significant increase in the junctional content of the tight junction-associated claudin-1 in intestinal epithelia of jejunum ileum and colon of both control and high-fat mice.

It has been demonstrated that butyrate has beneficial effects on intestinal mucosa displaying anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant and anti- carcinogenic actions.29-33 In vitro conditions butyrate induces an increase in the tight junction TJ-mediated epithelial bar- rier function by increasing the expression of the TJ-associated claudin-1 in intestinal cell line.34 Regarding its systemic effect there has been recently suggested an anti-diabetogenic effect of this SCFA in animal models of T1DM and T2DM which was related to its action as histone deacetylase HDAC inhibi- tor.3135-39 Nevertheless to the best of our knowledge there is no study looking at the relationship between the effect of butyrate on the T2DM-associated metabolic hepatic and pan- creatic alterations and its action on the TJ-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier.

The presence of these tissues where the expression of TJ proteins is low or non-existent may interfere with the sensitivity of the immunoblotting method to detect subtle differences in the expression of these proteins in the epithelium as probably happened in our experiments.Taken into account the marked increase in claudin-1 immunodetection seen in intestinal epithelial cryosections of butyrate-treated mice in comparison with controls we performed a functional analysis of the intestinal epithelial barrier using the FITC-Dextran FITC-DX permeability test.

This analysis revealed that CB Abs DX-FITC 0.61 - 0.156 and HFB mice Abs DX-FITC 0.47 - 0.136showed a significant decrease in intestinal absorption of the paracellular marker compared to control C group Abs DX-FITC 2.1 - 0.556 P  0.05 which was in agree- ment with the immunofluorescence data.Figure 4 Diet supplementation with butyrate inhibited hepatic steatosis and pancreatic fat accumulation induced by high-fat diet in mice.

Taken this into consideration the fact that butyrate-treated mice displayed significant lower adipose tissue infiltration within pancreas parenchyma after HF diet exposure as compared to HF mice may be another contributing factor.Our prediabetic mice also displayed a significant beta cell mass expansion which was not accompanied by changes in islet cytoarchitecture as compared to control animals.

Taken all into consideration we went to investigate the effect of butyrate supplementation on intes- tinal barrier function in our animal model of T2DMfocusing on the structure and function of the intestinal TJ an essential element of this barrier.62-65Exposure to HF diet for 60 days induced a significant decrease in the junctional content of claudin-1 a constitu- tive protein of intestinal TJ63 and a tendency of reduction in total protein content of this protein in the epithelium of intestinal segments jejunum ileum and colon as revealed by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot respectively.
