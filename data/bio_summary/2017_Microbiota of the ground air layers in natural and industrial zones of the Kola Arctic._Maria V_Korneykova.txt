There is a direct dependence of the fungal propagules content in the air mainly the spores that are able to protect themselves from the unfavorable factors on their content in the soil.The ground air layers of the Arctic and the Antarctica usu- ally contain a small amount of the cultivated fungi with the lim- ited species composition.The number of the airborne fungi was 0.77 CFU m3 in the Antarctica air3.1 CFU m3 in the Arctic islands air60 CFU m3 in the tundra and polar deserts air and up to 150 CFU m3 in the inhabited areas of the Arctic Ocean islands.The research on the number and species composition of the airborne fungi in megacities has been fulfilled.There is a trend towards the increase of the dark pigmented fungi species in the cities air especially during the leaf fall period.The Murmansk region is a part of the onshore Arctic area of the Russian Federation from 67o1101700 N32o2500300 E to 69o 180 5300 N 32o 030 1300 E.

The identification of fungi was carried out according to the culture-morphological charac- teristics using standard identification guides.The portion of dark pigmented and opportunistic fungi was determined as a percentage of the total number isolated and identified fungi species.

The bacteria and fungi number in the air by the contamination gradient due to the emissions of the Plant Pechenganickel.than temperature.Probably due to this the number of bac- teria and fungi in the air did not decrease in autumn especially in the eroded urbanized areas with higher numbers of fungi and bacteria in the air than in more remote regions.

According to the literature data the content of the opportunistic fungi increases in the large industrial centers in urban environment.The goal of this research is to study the number and diversity of microorganisms fungi and bacteria of the ground air layer in the natural and industrial zones of the Murmansk region.Materials and methodsClimatic characteristics of the research areaThe average climatic indices presented in do not affect only the vegetation and soil cover but also the ground air com- position including its biological components.

The por- tion of airborne fungi was higher than bacteria accounting to 60-77 of the total number.The highest amount of fungi in the impact area with air-gas emissions of the Aluminum Plant was detected over the nearest area 0.5 km to the plant.

In the ground air of both tundra and taiga the group of fungi with a sterile mycelium was widely represented.In the taiga zone the diversity of airborne fungi is richer than in the tundra zone as the former is located territorially to the south and has more diverse vegetation from the surface of which the fungal spores can penetrate the air.

Irrespective of the emissions composition in the air of both the Aluminum and the Copper-Nickel Plants the fungi of genus Penicillium predominated making 40-60 of the total distinguished spe- cies amount.Five species of airborne fungi were identified in the most contaminated area of the Kandalaksha Aluminum Plant emis- sions Aspergillus repens Penicillium aurantiogriseum P. ochro- chloron Talaromyces variabilis Torula herbarum which were not found in other areas.

Near the industrial plants the species of this group were revealed in the composition of airborne fungi which were not found in the air of the remote areas from the emission sources Torula herbarum Alternaria alternata Curvularia intermadia Cladosporium herbarum.The portion of opportunistic airborne fungi in the air increased near the plants and consequently in the settlements.

Opportunistic fungi in the air of the contaminated and background plots in the taiga zone.air of the contaminated areas where Aspergillus Penicillium Cladosporium genera are represented by a great variety of spe- cies and the fungi of genera Alternaria Curvularia Tricho- derma Fusarium are identified.ConclusionThus the new data on the number and diversity of microorgan- isms in the ground air layer at high latitudes in natural and anthropogenic conditions have been obtained.

The air of the Rybachy Peninsula where there are no industrial plants and the anthropogenic load is minimal is characterized by relative purity the number of air- borne fungi is 11-144 CFU 1 m3.In both of tundra and taiga areas genus Penicillium domi- nates among fungi and gram-positive bacteria dominate among bacterial biota.
