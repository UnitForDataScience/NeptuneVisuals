Strategically FMT is the most direct and radi- cal way to alter the composition of a human's enteric microbiota to improve the quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease Moayyedi et al 2015 Wei et al 2015 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Le Roy et al 2013 metabolic syndrome Vrieze et al 2012 and neuropsychiatric disorders Xu et al 2015.

Our observa- tion showed that the gavage of sex-matched faecal microbiota had distinguishable effects on immunity and metabolism Marcobal et al 2013 Bromberg et al 2015 suggesting that different sex- specific gut microbiota performs divergent physiologic status.

After 8 Gy irradiation exposure the survival rate of mice treated with FMT combined with BMT was much higher than that of mice treated FMT or BMT alone Figs 2I and EV1I suggesting that FMT combined with BMT might significantly mitigate irradiation-induced toxicity.FMT restores GI tract function and epithelial integrity after irradiationOn the basis of the aforementioned observations we further untan- gled the impact of FMT on GI function and integrity in animals receiving faecal microbiota transferred from the same gender after irradiation exposure.

Therefore our findings support the hypothesis that FMT might emerge as a potential therapeutic option for radiation- induced death.Given that multiple factors such as age and genetics Lozupone et al 2012 can drive gut microbiota alteration the use of FMT should follow guidelines.

FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Keywords faecal microbiota transplantation gastrointestinal toxicity gut microbiota radiation syndrome radiotherapySubject Categories Cancer Digestive System Microbiology Virology  Host Pathogen InteractionDOI 10.15252emmm.201606932  Received 10 August 2016  Revised 20January 2017  Accepted 25 January 2017  Published online 27 February 2017EMBO Mol Med 2017 9 448-461IntroductionRadiation exposure in a mass casualty setting is a serious military and public health concern Taniguchi et al 2014.

Although we observed that ampicillin and strep- tomycin conferred protection against sub-lethal irradiation these antibiotics did not heighten peripheral WBC counts Appendix Fig S1C and D indicating that antibiotics could not ameliorate radia- tion-induced haematopoietic syndrome.Gavage of faecal microbiota protects against radiation-induced deathDivergent factors such as genetic predisposition diet and inflamma- tion states can differently affect enteric bacterial flora Smith et al 2015 Schaubeck et al 2016.

Accordingly we performed sex-matched or mismatched FMT according to the following scheme female faecal microbiota transplants to male or female mice female  TBI male faecal microbiota transplants to male or female mice male  TBI and a mixture of faecal microbiota from male and female transplants to male or female mice femalemale  TBI the weight of male and female stool was 11 saline was used as a control saline  TBI.

Exposure to a high dose of irradiation in a short time is associated with bone marrow toxicity haematopoietic syndrome and gastrointestinal GItoxicity GI syndrome which are collectively known as acute radia- tion syndrome ARS Kirsch et al 2010 Leibowitz et al 2014.

For example intestinal microbes govern metabolic function and energy balance and flora disequilibrium is deemed to contribute to the development of numerous metabolic diseases Amar et al 2011 Nieuwdorp et al 2014.

Moreover marked shifts in bacterial communities in the gut are inextricably intertwined with the development of diet-associated cancer Schulz et al 2014 Feng et al 2015 Gorjifard  Goldszmid 2015 suggesting that enteral bacteria might be used as diagnostic biomarkers for many cancers.
