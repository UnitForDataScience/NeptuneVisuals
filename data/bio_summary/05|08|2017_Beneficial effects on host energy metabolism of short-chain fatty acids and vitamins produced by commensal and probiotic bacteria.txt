This strain was first shown to be able to produce folate in cul-ture medium  and then shown to enhance the folate status increased plasma and liver concentrations in rats showing that animals studies can be a good indicator for beneficial effects in humans.From a biochemical point of view it is clear that these B-group vitamins are either directly or indirectly involved in energy metabolism and since certain LAB and bifido- bacteria strains can produce these vitamins in very large amounts there is an increasing interest in using such bacteria for the development of novel energy drinks or food supplements.We have evaluated the in vitro potential to produce and release de novo vitamins B1B2 and B9 of four probiotic bacterial strains L. rhamnosus GG B. longum SP 073B.

longum and B. bifidum were low but significant pro- ducer of intracellular thiamine B1 without extracellular synthesis but were not able to produce either folates B9 either riboflavin B2.Discussion and conclusionsThe scientific data summarized in this review indicate a relationship between SCFA and B group vitamins pro- duced by commensal and probiotic bacteria and energy metabolism by the host.We propose that SCFAs and B group producing bac- teria can increase the production of ATP however their direct impact on fatigue in human must be further evalu- ated to understand the relationship between fatigue and intestinal microbiota.Recent studies conducted on chronic fatigue syndrome have already suggested a role for altered intestinal micro- biota in the pathogenesis of this disease   and therapeutic efforts to modify gut microbiota could be a means to modulate the development andor progression of this disorder .A new approach could be to evaluate the relation- ship between the ability of selected probiotics strains to produce energy metabolites and their impact on fatigue in humans.

The production of SCFAs by these bacteria is poten- tially an essential regulatory effector of epithelial prolif- eration in the gut .One of the best-characterized probiotic strain Lacto- bacillus rhamnosus strain GG LGG has been included in several studies with mix of probiotic strains andprebiotics where it was able to metabolize these prebiot- ics leading to SCFAs production.The few available human clinical studies based on the production of SCFAs have been performed using a mix- ture of probiotics and prebiotics.

There are also reports of genetically modified strains that produce elevated concentrations of folates - and some of which have been shown to be effective in the reversion of folate deficiencies in mice  .Vitamins production by probiotic bacteriaAlthough most vitamin producing-microorganisms identified so far cannot be considered probiotics because they lack essential studies survival in the GIT adherence to mucosal cells evidence of their effects in humans clinical trials there are promising probiotic strains that have been shown to be able to produce B group vitamins.L.

In fact the human gut microbiota influences the systemic metabolism of the host modulating the metabolic profile of topographically remote organs such as the liver and the kidney .Moreover besides the commensal bacteria transit- ing food-grade and probiotic bacteria are also playing a role in host energy metabolism through the production of some biogenic compounds in functional foods theyi improve the nutritional composition of these foods in free vitamins bioactive peptides and g-amino butyric acid GABA - and ii increase the concentration of free amino acids and other nutritional compounds and metabolites -.

During the catabolism of fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms and certain amino acids valine isoleucine methionine and threonine propionyl-CoA is converted to succinyl- CoA for oxidation in the Krebs cycle through enzymes that requires vitamin B12 cobalamin or vitamin B7 biotin as co-factors.Vitamins production by commensal food-grade and probiotic bacteriaAlthough most LAB and bifidobacteria are considered auxotroph for vitamins production there is an increas- ing amount of evidence that certain strains of these twogroups of bacteria can produce B-group vitamins.

These vitamins are normally stored inside the cells and released by direct diffusion using specific trans- porters in the cell membrane or via cellular lysis either in their growth media or inside the GIT of the host making these strains ideal candidates for the in situ delivery of B group vitamins.Vitamins production by commensal bacteriaAlthough it has been suggested that some commensal bacterial species can synthesize essential vitamins espe- cially of the B and K groups  there are very few works that have been able to isolate and prove that specific com- mensal bacteria are able to produce these vitamins and no data on their concentrations effectively produced in the GIT have been published yet.

Based on this scheme we can consider that diet supplement containing probiotic lactobacilli andor bifidobacteria can probably contrib- ute positively to this process and thus play a role in this process.The key role of vitamins produced by commensal and probiotic bacteria in host energy metabolism As previously stated in the introduction to convert food into ATP the energy storing molecule numer- ous co-factors including B group vitamins are involved.

Here we have thus evaluated the in vitro potential to produce and release de novo SCFAs of four probiotic bacterial strains LGG Bifidobacterium longum SP 073B.

with different fibers with different microbiota or in different disease models 2 How do these SCFAs then affect glucose and lipids fluxes via their dual role as substrates and regulators And 3 does the demand of the host for specific SCFAs drive a change in microbial metabolismA quantitative and time-resolved approach to these questions should bring a great step forward to elucidate the role of SCFAs in mammalian energy metabolism.
