In fact physiological translocation of commensal bacteria from the gut to different mucosal surfaces has already been shown in vitro and in vivo through a mechanism involving complex interactions between bacteria epithelial cells and immune cells including dendritic cells and macrophages .

Some studies have revealed the ability of certain gut bacteria to spread to extra-digestive locations in healthy hosts - while others including in vitro animal and human studies have shown that physiological bacterial translocation during late pregnancy has a scientifically plausible basis and may involve complex interactions between microbes immune cells and gut epithelial cells --.Gut bacteria translocation has usually been associated with pathogenic conditions - but a low rate of bacterial translocation involving Bacteroides lactobacilli bifidobacteria or enterococci occurs in healthy hosts - and may be associated to physiological immunomodulation .

Although the origin of the bacteria naturally present in this biological fluid can be diverse the results of this study confirm that there may be a physiological translocation of certain bacterial strains from the maternal digestive tract to the mammary gland and milk.Acknowledgments This research was supported by Nutricia Research Utrecht The Netherlands and by grants AGL2016-75476-R PCIN-2015-234 RED RICET RD1200180004 and BIOMID ISCIII SAF2016-75988-R MINECO HOMIN-317057-FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN EU.Author Contributions Juan Miguel Rodriguez Manuel Fresno and Leonides Fernandez conceived designed the experiments and prepared the manuscript Javier de Andres Esther Jimenez and Isabel Chico-Calero performed the experiments analyzed the data and revised the manuscript.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesFernandez L.
