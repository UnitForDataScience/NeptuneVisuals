Using fMRI Agostini et al37 and Bao et al38 found abnormal functional activity in the cerebral cortex of patients with CD Table 1.Agostini et al37 hypothesized inadequate habituation to stress as a characteristic for CD patients and their study sought to compare neural habituation between CD patients and healthy subjects.

fMRS studies therefore offer unpatrolled versatility for evaluation of patients with CD and serve to prevent further disease progression and relieve symptoms of abdominal pain for patients suffering from CD.REFERENCESF1000Prime Rep 2015 7 44 PMID 26097717 DOI 10.12703 P7-44Erickson AR Cantarel BL Lamendella R Darzi Y Mongodin EF Pan C Shah M Halfvarson J Tysk C Henrissat B Raes J Verberkmoes NC Fraser CM Hettich RL Jansson JK.

As Prosberg et al8 demonstrated through a systematic review patients with active IBD had lower abundance of intestinal flora compared to patients in remission.

These results suggested that the self- regulation of stress levels in CD patients is decreased which can be an important factor in exacerbating intestinal inflammation.Bao et al38 investigated changes in resting-statebrain activity in paracmastic CD patients with and without abdominal pain.

Furthermore investigations have shown white- matter lesions and neurologic deficits in patients with IBD.

Based on these findings brain activity changes in CD patients have been detected by blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD-fMRI.

Therefore biochemical concentrations of neurotransmitters or metabolites may change in corresponding brain regions of CD patients.

To further study this phenomenon brain changes of CD patients can be detected non-invasively effectively and accurately by BOLD-fMRI combined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS.
