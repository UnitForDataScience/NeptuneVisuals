studies of the human microbiome diverse clinical and environmental samples and even identification of potential bioterror agents all require analysis of microbial mixtures.

the advances in ms for characterization of monomicrobial cultures have in turn catalyzed considerable interest in ms-based approaches for microbial mixture analysis.
