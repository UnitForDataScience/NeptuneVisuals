MALDI- TOF instruments underpin nearly all of these commercially available platforms.While MALDI-TOF-based platforms have become ubiquitous and have been shown to be highly effective other types of MS systems are also introduced to characterize microorganisms including their mixtures and interactions.143536 instruments--trap-TOF37 3839 40 particle mass spectrometry SPMS analyzers.7 electrospray ionization coupled with tandem MS for rapid characteri- zation of microorganisms including their proteomes and metabo- lomes have been steadily increasing for example in mapping bacteria with unsequenced genomes41 42 proteogenomics.4344 pressure ionization API methods developed in the last decade or so4546 47 mixtures.1348-50 Recent advances in MS analysis of individual microbial culturesRegardless of the particular MS technology used to characterize microorganisms there is clear consensus in the literature that MS- based approaches are highly effective at characterizing pure cultures of diverse microorganisms in both clinicalmedical and environmental settings.355152 particular isolation and monomicrobial cultivation of target micro- organisms to facilitate MS-based characterization of microorganisms.

real time analysis and avoids artifacts that result from the MALDI matrix features that will be increasingly exploited in the analysis of mixtures.1348-50 DATA ANALYSIS  Library--biomarker and spectral similarity-- approachesWhile a diverse array of sample preparation ionization methods and instrumentation has been used to generate spectra of microbial mixtures common data analysis workflows involve two general approaches 1 biomarker and 2 spectral similarity coefficient- based data analysis.

Five pathogenic Candida species have been differentiated by REIMS with 98.8 accuracy.Early on after its introduction another API technique--direct analysis in real time DART--has been demonstrated as a rapid tool for microorganism identification utilizing fatty acids methyl ester pro- files.46 species have been analyzed without derivatization directly on a DART- TOF instrument and identified based on negative ion profiles of their fatty acids with 100 accuracy.117 analysis of volatile organic compounds VOC from microorganisms have been reviewed recently.118 119 DART-TOF MS commercial instrument for rapid VOC analysis released when a plasma jet electric discharge impacts whole bacterial cells.

Correlations between genomic sequence data and proteomic mass spectrometry have significantly expanded to include identification of organism-specific protein and peptide biomarkers in both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as comparative proteomics.44 extension of the traditional single proteome approach MS data are analyzed by utilizing multiple genome sequences improving both proteome and genome annotations and discovering less frequent post-translational modifications.43Efforts to automate annotation of newly sequenced organisms have led to the development of N-terminomics--compiling expanded lists of experimentally validated start codons and signal peptides.164 comparative proteogenomics study of large experimental data sets including 112 million mass spectra from 57 bacterial species has demonstrated that N-terminal methionine cleavage is among the most common protein post-translational modifications in prokaryotes.Characterizing the secretomes of pathogenic as well as non- pathogenic organisms has benefited from maturing proteogenomic bioinformatics tools.175 analysis allows questions such as the number of signal peptides released by bacteria to be addressed.181 prediction software SignalP and Phobius has been correlated to experimental MS data for E. coli K-12 confirming not only known peptides but validating 31 additional peptides mostly from exported proteins.

MS analysis instrumentation and techniquesTOF mass analysis is currently the most popular MS method applied to microorganism characterization.

For example multiple bacteria could not be identified in polymicrobial cultures and a single bacterium was identified by MALDI MS in only 64 of the polymicrobial cultures.5777 ity of MS for direct analysis of microbial mixtures for example non- uniqueness of MS signatures and biomarkers both protein-based or small-molecule-based lack of appropriate software ion suppression effects higher background levels etc.

Analysis of MS imaging dataAn overview of data analysis workflows in MSI including computational challenges has been presented recently.199 MSI data analysis include a number ofmultivariate statistical tools.

Mixtures of environmental microbes are analyzed by MS using isolate-based mixture assessment IBMA in which the diversity of microorganisms in an environment is assessed by cultivating and analyzing by MS one microorganism at a time rather than by direct analysis of complex environmental samples.
