There are many studies postulating the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effect of metformin including improvement in insulin sensitivity and consequently a reduction in insulin levels.

Rather members of butyrate-producing taxa of gut microbiome improve insulin sensitivity .The state of pre-diabetes is characterized by high insulin levels and it is also observed that the concentration of insulin in the por- tal circulation is greater compared to the peripheral circulation in non-diabetic and diabetic subjects .

The reduction of insulin levels will lessen the effect of insulin on the growth of NBPB at least E coli and S aur- eus and thus break the insulin promoted feedback cycle seen in and expected to control obesity.

Obesity is related to insulin resistance which will further induce the insulin release and rise in insulin levels.

Keeping this frame of reference in mind we propose a hypothesis explaining metformin and its role as an anti-obesity drug.HypothesisWe hypothesize that metformin exerts its anti-obesity action by enhancing the butyrate-producing taxa in the gut microbiome in the hyper-insulinemic phase of prediabetes.

Therefore synergistic actions of butyrate and metformin are likely to explain the anti-obesity actions of metformin.

Thus it appears that metformin exerts it anti-obesity effect by modulating the composition of the gut microbiome in the presence of increased levels of insulin.gism with metformin.

In a recent analysis comparing metformin use and lifestyle intervention in population at high risk of developing diabetes it was observed that effect of metformin was best seen in individuals with the highest risk of developing diabetes and such an effect was decreased as the risk factors decreased .

So metformin by reducing insulin can lessen the growth of at least two non- butyrate producing components of gut microbiome .

In- vitro detailed experiments to evaluate the effect of metformin and insulin on various bacteria and which are part of the gut microbiome should be undertaken.
