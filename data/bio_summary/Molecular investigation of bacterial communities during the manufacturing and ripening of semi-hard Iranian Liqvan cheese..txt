the correlation coefficients r2 and effi- ciency of amplification were calculated as described in .quantification of the viable bacteria in the milk curd and cheese was carried out by amplifying 1 ml of cdna and using the standard curves for the calculation of the counts.bacterial rna analysis by means of illumina high-throughput sequencinga high-throughput sequencing approach was applied to a total of 15 samples 5 samples from milk curd and cheese.

other lab were randomly distributed between curd and cheese except lactococcus raffinolactis that was not found in cheese.the results of the quantification rt-pcr showed 8.5 - 0.2 log cfuml for milk and 5.8 - 0.2 and 3.5 - 0.1 log cfug for curd and cheese respectively.

in this study the microbiota of the milk curd and cheese has been investigated using culture independent approaches.

after 2 h of drainage the coagulum is cut into15 15 cm cubes and placed in 15e20 saline water where it is left for 9e10 h. the curd is consequently covered with dry salt and kept in a basin for 2e3 days during which whey drainage continues.

finally the resulting curd is placed in 10e12 saline water in metal containers.

furthermore the total counts and diversity of the viable bacterial populations in the raw milk curd and ripened cheese have been investigated using rt quanti- tative pcr rt-qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing respectively.material and methodssample collectionsamples of raw milk curds and cheeses were collected asepti- cally on-site at five different local authentic production units a toe in the liqvan village which covers an area of 19.76 square ki- lometers in the south-western part of tabriz province.

a fingerprint database was created using bionumerics software version 4.6 applied maths sint marten latem belgium.construction of athe lab standard curve for viable bacterial enumerationthe viable bacterial populations in the milk curd and cheese were determined according to .

milk curd and cheese were sterilized.

the shannon-wiener diversity index h' was further analyzed using the t-test to assess any differences between the milk curd and cheese samples.

kegg orthologs were then collapsed at a hierarchy level of 3 and the table was imported into r. the made4 package was adopted and hierarchical ward-linkage clustering based on the spearman correlation coefficients of the proportion of the activities belonging to lipid carbohydrates and amino acid metabolism pathways was used to produce a heatplot.all the sequencing data were deposited at the sequence readarchive of the national center for biotechnology information srp074051.resultsidentification and total bacterial counts during ripeningeleven different bands corresponding to the bacterial v3 region were observed in the milk curd and cheese samples .

lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were the pre- dominant species that recovered from all of the different types of samples while streptococcus thermophilus was only found in the curd.

on the other hand bands related to enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas fluorescens were mostly abundant in the milk and curd but there was no trace of them in the cheese samples.

in addition overall sample diversity index shannon were calculated as 6.47 - 0.38 5.17 - 0.65 and5.63 - 0.42 in milk curd and cheese respectively.

besides the alpha-diversity showed that there was a higher level of complexity p  0.05 in the milk samples than in the curds and cheeses and between the cheeses and the curds p  0.05. it was possible to show through a principal coordinate analysis pcoa with a weighted unifrac distance matrix data not shown as well as from adonis and anosim statistical tests that the samples were grouped together according to their type p  0.001. in addition no dif- ferences were found between the milk cheese and curd samples for the different repeats according to the adonis and anosim statistical tests p  0.001. adonis and anosim statistical tests of weighted unifrac distance matrix showed significant difference among sample type p  0.001. only otus with a relative abundance of 0.5 in at least two samples are shown in .
