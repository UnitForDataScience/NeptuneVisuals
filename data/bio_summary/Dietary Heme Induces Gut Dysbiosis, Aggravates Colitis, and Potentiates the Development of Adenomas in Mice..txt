Therefore to further investigate the impact of heme iron on DSS-induced colitis we compared colitis severity in mice fed with the diet supplemented with heme to mice fed with the control diet and receiving heme administered intraperitoneally to bypass the lumen of the gut.Compared with mice receiving the control diet mice that received the heme-supplemented diet lost more body weight when treated with DSS  had an increased inflammation  and tissue damage scores  as well as higher levels of the inflammatory markers lipocalin 2 Lcn2    and interleukin-6 Il-6  in the gut.

Most importantly the changes in levels of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were reproduced in mice fed with the heme-supplemented diet .Within the phylum Firmicutes and at the species level we found that mice fed the heme-supplemented diet had similar microbial shifts as DSS-treated mice namely a marked decrease of unclassified unc.

Although there were no significant differences in the whole butanoate metabolism pathways between mice fed the heme-supplemented diet and mice fed the control diet wedid find a significant decrease in the metagenomic presence of butyrate kinase phosphate butyryltransferase and the a-subunit of butyryl-CoAacetate Co-A transferase with an increase in the b-subunit in mice receiving the heme-supplemented diet .

Among others we found periplasmic TonB protein heme uptake a putative hemin transport protein heme uptake a hydroxymethylbilane synthase heme synthesis heme exporter protein A heme export iron complex outer membrane receptor protein iron-siderophore uptake and hemolysin III implicated in red blood cell lysis to be enriched in mice fed the heme supplemented diet as well as in DSS-treated mice when compared to control mice receiving the control diet .

Furthermore a reduction in fecal butyrate levels was found in mice fed the heme supplemented diet compared to mice fed the control diet.

In UC patients ingestion of heme-rich red meat increases the likelihood of flare relapse  .In this study we investigated the influence of dietary heme on the microbiota and inferred gut metagenome functional composition as well as its impact on colitis and colitis-associated adenoma development in mice.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimalsC57BL6 mice were bred and maintained under standard 1212 h lightdark conditions at the Centre de Recherche du CHUM CRCHUM and were co-caged at four to five mice per cage.

As shown in  stool heme levels were increased in mice fed the heme-supplemented diet and in mice subjected to DSS.

PCoA  showed that mice fed the control diet clustered separately from mice fed the heme-supplemented diet indicating that heme iron substantially altered the composition of the gut microbiota.

In the phylum Bacteroidetes two species were decreased in mice fed the heme-supplemented diet and in DSS-treated mice namely unc.

C Each symbol in both graphics represents one mouse and the line demarks the mean.when compared to control mice receiving PBS mice receiving heme intraperitoneally had a milder DSS-induced colitis as indicated by higher body weights  as well as lower Lcn2 mRNA levels  and reduced Enterobacteriaceae levels  with the inflammation  and tissue damage  scores remaining unaffected.The presence of inflammation in the gut for long periods of time augments the risk for the development of colon cancer     .We next studied the impact of dietary heme in the AOMDSS mouse model of carcinogenesis.
