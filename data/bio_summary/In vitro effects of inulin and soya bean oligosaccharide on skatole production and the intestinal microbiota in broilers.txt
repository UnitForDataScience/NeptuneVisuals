Cc SBO and Rc represent caecal microbiota control soya bean oligosaccharide and rectal microbiota control respectivelythe rate of L-try degradation and fermentation parameters were significantly different between bacterial sources p  .05.

The results showed that concentrations of skatole and acetic acid were signifi- cantly lower in caecal microbiota fermentation broth MFB than those in rectal MFB p  .05.

The results of cluster analysis indicated that the microbiota in the control groups and the oligosaccharide groups belonged to different branches.FIGURE 2 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE fingerprints of 16S rDNA PCR products obtained in the in vitro fermentation samples.

However signifi- cant changes in the composition of rectal microbiota may also have occurred.5  CONCLUSIONS The concentration of indole and skatole the rate of L-try degradation and pH value decreased with shifts in microbial composition and the populations which were influenced by the addition of inulin or SBO into the fermentation broth.
