the core genome between the 2 isolates consists of 2332 genes.while the two isolates have differing profiles of antibiotic resistance genes both carry genes that confer resistance to aminoglycosides 13-lactams fosfomycin olaquin- dox quinolone sulfonamide and tetracycline.

both isolates carry genes encoding extended-spectrum 13-lactamases.acteria of the enterobacter cloacae complex are commensal enteric bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.

cloacae isolates 49530189 and 60830776 from the enterobacter cloacae complex which were isolated from two different individuals with hospital-acquired bacteremia.

both isolates were obtained by blood culture and their antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using eucast breakpoints with the bd- pheonix automated platform becton dickinson nj usa and double-disc testing.

whole-genome amplicon libraries were prepared using an illumina nextera xt dna sample preparation kit illumina inc. ca and sequenced on an illumina nextseq platform with a nextseq 500550 mid-output kit v2 illumina 2 x 150-bp cycles.a total of 3066602 and 1876696 paired-end reads for isolates 49530189 and 60830776 respectively were mapped to the enterobacter cloacae subsp.

the draft genomevolume 5 issue 33 e00756-17 1leong et al.of isolate 49530189 consisted of 170 contigs with a total of 5467426 bp and gc content of 54.8. the draft genome of isolate 60830776 consisted of 140 contigs with a total of 5168633 bp and gc content of 54.6. isolates 49530189 and 60830776 have 5239 and 4879 coding domain sequences respectively.

the two isolates are ampc negatve and esbl positive.
