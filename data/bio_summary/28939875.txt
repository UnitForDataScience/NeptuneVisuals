The fasting glucose level of the HF TS group and the control group was significantly lower than the HF group all p  0.05 while there was no difference between the HF  TS group and the control group p  0.326.

A Bacteroides-Prevotella Desulfovibrios Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus DNA expressions in gut microbiota of the control group Con high-fat diet group HF and HF with teasaponin treatment group HF TS n 12 per group.

Protein expression levels of TLR4 MyD88 p-JNK NFkB IL-1b IL-6 and TNF-a in the hippocampus of the control group Con high-fat diet group HF and HF with teasaponin treatment group HF TS n 12 per group.

Importantly the teasaponin treatment significantly increased the BDNF level in the hippocampus of the HF  TS group compared to the HF group p  0.011 but the BDNF level in the HF  TS group was still lower p  0.001 than the control group Fig.

After the teasaponin treatment for 6 weeks the final body weight was significantly lower in the HF  TS group than the HF group HF  TS 31.32 - 1.87 g HF 39.14 - 3.67 g p  0.038 however the body weight in the HF  TS group remained higher than the control group HF  TS31.32 - 1.87 g Control 27.33 - 1.54 g p  0.001 Fig.

The object exploration time A and the discrimination index B in the novel object recognition test of the control group Con high-fat diet group HF and HF with teasaponin treatment group HF  TS.C The level of BDNF expression in the hippocampus of mice n 12 per group.

B The plasma LPS level of control group Con high-fat diet group HF and HF with teasaponin treatment group HF TS n 12 per group.of pro-inflammatory factors in the hippocampus of mice.

Teasaponin significantly reduced the CD11c positive staining p  0.001 but there was no significant difference in the CD206 staining of the colon among the control group the HF group and the HF TS group Fig.

During the training session of the test there was no significant difference in the percentage of time spent exploring the objects in the open-field among the control group the HF group and the HF  TS group p  0.05.

A Microglia accumulation in the hippocampus of the control group Con high-fat diet group HF and HF with teasaponin treatment group HF  TS shown at x5 A1-3 x10 A4-6 and x40 A7-9 magnification Scale bar 20 mm.
