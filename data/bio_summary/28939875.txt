the fasting glucose level of the hf ts group and the control group was significantly lower than the hf group all p  0.05 while there was no difference between the hf  ts group and the control group p  0.326. the blood glucose level of the teasaponin treatment group significantly decreased at 15 30 60 and 120 minutes compared with the hf group all p  0.05 but they were still higher than those of the control group all p  0.05.discussionour results show that a long-term teasaponin treatment improved gut microbiota suppressed endotoxin in plasma enhanced object recognition memory inhibited hippocampal inflammation and gliosis and increased bdnf in the hippocampus in hf diet fed mice.

during the training session of the test there was no significant difference in the percentage of time spent exploring the objects in the open-field among the control group the hf group and the hf  ts group p  0.05. during the retention session hf micefigure 4. a microglia accumulation in the hippocampus of the control group con high-fat diet group hf and hf with teasaponin treatment group hf  ts shown at x5 a1-3 x10 a4-6 and x40 a7-9 magnification scale bar 20 mm.

microglial number in the hf ts group was similar to the control group p  0.214. meanwhile the hf diet increased the number of astrocytes in the hippocampus of obese mice by nearly 25 compared to the control mice fed lab chow p  0.002. teasaponin to some degree ameliorated astrocyte accu- mulation in the hippocampus of the hf group but there was no statistical difference p  0.147. the number of astrocytes in the hippocampus of the hf ts group was still higher than the control group p  0.044 fig.

importantly the teasaponin treatment significantly increased the bdnf level in the hippocampus of the hf  ts group compared to the hf group p  0.011 but the bdnf level in the hf  ts group was still lower p  0.001 than the control group fig.

after the teasaponin treatment for 6 weeks the final body weight was significantly lower in the hf  ts group than the hf group hf  ts 31.32 - 1.87 g hf 39.14 - 3.67 g p  0.038 however the body weight in the hf  ts group remained higher than the control group hf  ts31.32 - 1.87 g control 27.33 - 1.54 g p  0.001 fig.

teasaponin significantly reduced the cd11c positive staining p  0.001 but there was no significant difference in the cd206 staining of the colon among the control group the hf group and the hf ts group fig.

the hf diet decreased the discrimination index by 58.62 compared to the control group p  0.001 while the teasaponin treatment increased the discrimination index by 133.33 compared with the hf group p  0.001 without significant dif- ference compared with control group fig.
