These two contra-rotating eddies provided a fortuitous opportunity to study for the first time the importance of eddies from these different oceanic environments and with contrasting internal dynamics upwelling vs downwelling on the entrainment of microbes within the APFZ and the mechanisms responsible for their distribution.Nutrient analysis and primary productivityThe APFZ in which these eddies were observed is characterized as a zone of high-nutrient low-chlorophyll   due to light limitation deficiency of trace nutrients such as iron silica limitation of diatom production  and grazing by zooplankton .

Regional investigations in the vicinity of the Prince Edward Islands have shown that eddies provide an important foraging ground for the islands' resident grey-headed albatrosses  and elephant seals -.Previous studies show that the environment upstream of the Prince Edward Islands is rich in eddies characterized by mixed plankton communities and diverse biogeography .

Simply put eddies form turbu- lent ocean whirlwinds that depending on their rotation have the ability to stimulate or sup- press surface layers of their nutrient and microbial content.The opportunity to compare the impact of contrasting ocean dynamics on the microbial communities of Southern Ocean eddies presented itself between 22 April and 7 May 2012.

This provided a unique opportunity to investigate the microbial communities in eddies from different oceanic environments and with contrasting internal dynamics upwell- ing vs downwelling and their potential influence on ecosystem function of the APFZ.Bacterial community analysisA total of 90402 bacterial 16S rRNA sequence reads obtained from samples collected across the two eddies were analyzed .

As with the bacterial communities the presence of eddy-specific chloroplast OTUs that were also present in the waters from which these eddies originated is consistent with the entrainment of biota from their point of origin.Distinct microbial communities in warm- versus cold-core eddiesA Non-metric Multiple Dimension Scaling NMDS analysis was conducted to examine the relatedness between microbial communities present in the two eddies.

Given the fairly even distribution of the dominant OTUs between these two eddies it is likely that Planc- tomycetes diversity may be an important factor in distinguishing the bacterial communitiesof the two eddies.

Overall the close relationship between bacterial and microphytoplankton communi- ties in the warm- and cold-core eddies with the Subantarctic and Antarctic respectively are consistent with the entrainment of biota from the eddy source transport to and eventual release into the APFZ.Upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom waters by cold-core eddies results in high levels of pri- mary productivity that make them important foraging grounds for top predators .

Transient mesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean are known to relocate zoo- plankton communities across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ACC and are important foraging grounds for marine top predators.
