In week 1 it was 1.47 1.23 1.70 in the verum and 1.47 1.23 1.67 in the placebo group P0.871in week 2 it was 1.53 1.07 1.87 in the verum and 1.23 1.02 1.38 in the placebo group P0.11 in week 3 it was 1.47 1.17 1.77 in the verum and 1.20 1.08 1.40 in the placebo group P0.051 in week 4 it was 1.33 1.101.70 in the verum and 1.13 1.00 1.37 in the placebo group P0.077.Adverse eventsIn 11 women of the verum group compared to 12 women of the placebo group adverse events were seen P0.71 in Chi2 test.

Compliance with antibiotic treatment was identical in both groups 98.3-5.4 P1.000 in Mann-Whitney test based on counting the not consumed antibiotics at visit D. Compliance with adhering to antibiotic treatment according to Morisky was similar with 3.8-0.5 in the verum group and 3.9-0.5 in the placebo group P0.575 Mann- Whitney test.Recovery rate of bacterial vaginosisFAS Out of the 17 women in whom BV was diagnosed based on Amsel criteria in the verum group before intervention at G1 all 17 were BV-free based on Amsel criteria after 4 weeks intervention at G2 whereas only 11 out of 17 became BV-free in the placebo group Table 2.

Of the 36 randomised women 36 received the study products with 18 women in the verum group and 18 women in the placebo group and thus comprise the ITT population.

It decreased by -1.12-0.88 in the verum group compared to -0.65-0.76 in the placebo group P0.109 in Student t test during intervention and tended to be lower 4.19-0.50 in the verum group compared to 4.57-0.74 in the placebo group after 4 weeks intervention P0.091 in Student t testTable 3.

The PP and ITT populations showed alterations in alignment with these results see Supplementary Materials S2 - Tables S2 and S3.In the verum group in 9 out of 17 women the partner were also treated with metronidazole in the placebo group this was the case in 8 out of 16 women.

Amsel criteria vaginal pH and Nugent score in the full analysis set.Gastrointestinal symptomsAAD as defined by WHO occured in 417 women of the verum group during the 4 weeks intervention compared to 217 women of the placebo group P0.656 in Fisher Exact test.

Thus the FAS comprised n33 women for the primary parameter and n34 women for the secondary parameter.Four 11.1 subjects n2 in the verum vs n2 in the placebo group revealed major deviations so that n32 women comprise the PP-population.

Bristol stool form score defined as the sum of products of each Bristol stool form count multiplied by the number of type 1 to 7 for each type 1 to 7 was 124 93.0 167 in the verum group compared to 124 71.5 171 in the placebo group P0.971 in Mann-Whitney U test.The total score according to GSRS did neither differ between both groups in the week before intervention 1.20 1.02 1.73 in the verum and 1.20 1.02 1.63 in the placebo group P0.870 in Mann-Whitney U test nor during the 4 week intervention.

1993 to 4.19-0.50 in the verum group whereas it remained on average above the normal range with 4.57-0.74 in the placebo group.The design compares the outcomes after standard therapy in a group taking yoghurt containing the pertinent strains with that in a group taking a milk product with identical nutrient content taste and appearance.

In the probiotic group the cure rate as assessed by Nugent score was significantly higher 88 P0.001 after 30 days of consumption compared to the placebo group 40 BV-free women Anukam et al.
