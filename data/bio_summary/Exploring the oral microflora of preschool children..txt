The core saliva microbiome had the greatest number of OTUs 106 compared with plaque 86 and tongue coating 60.A co-occurrence network of plaque saliva and tongue coatingA total of 1190 OTUs were assigned to the genus or species level.

S2.Supragingival plaque had the highest a diversity and a dif- ferent microbial structure than saliva and tongue coatingA comparison of a diversity across each niche plaque saliva and tongue coating using the Shannon index revealed sig- nificant differences P  0.001 Fig.

Only Staphy- lococcus aureus infection and Ion channels were enriched in saliva the remaining 9 pathways were enriched in supra- gingival plaque compared to saliva and tongue coating.

The plaque samples harbored a higher proportion of Actinobacteria while Firmicutes were the most abundant in saliva and tongue coa- ting.

The bacterial abundances and distribution structures of plaque were different from those of saliva and tongue coating which probably lie in the gra- dients and variations in physico-chemical features at diffe- rent sites such as moisture oxygen concentration and pH Simon-Soro et al.

The highest microbial diversity rich- ness and evenness were identified in plaque samples com- pared with saliva and tongue coating Fig.

The co-occurrence network presented in this study provides novel insight into the microbial associations across plaque saliva and tongue coating.

Samples were collected from supragingival plaque saliva and tongue coating from 10 preschool children 30 samples total.

We found the highest a diversity microbial richness and evenness in plaque com- pared with saliva and tongue coating.

In summary our study provides a framework of oral microbial communities in the population of preschool chil- dren as a baseline for further studies of oral diseases related to microbes.Keywords 16S rRNA gene sequencing PICRUSt microbiome supragingival plaque saliva tongue coatingFor correspondence.
