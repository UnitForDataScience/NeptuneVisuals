Season-specific emis- sion rates and air exchange rates were used for winter sampling 2 and summer sampling 1.Soluble chemicalsBathroom tiles two at each sampling period and kitchen coupons four at each sampling point were extracted with methanol for 20 min three times and the methanol ex- tracts from the same samples were combined and driedTable 1 Model parameters for VOC emissionsdown to 500 mL.

Our observations include visual and microscopic inspection analysis of microbes by both DNA and RNA sequencing analysis of mVOCs emitted from the surfaces and analysis of soluble chemicals extracted from the sampling surfaces and from microbes cultivated from the sampling surfaces.

Immediately after in- stallation surfaces were cleaned with an ethanol wipe.The first period of sampling termed sampling 1 or S1 was in August 2016 and the second period of sampling termed sampling 2 or S2 occurred in February 2017.

At each sampling point two tiles and two coupons that were not exposed to the indoor environ- ment were extracted in the same way as blanks for meta- bolomics analysis.To explore the potential of the microorganisms to se- crete the chemical compounds observed in the home we compared our environmental samples with the me- tabolites of the microorganisms growing in culture.

For the kitchen surfaces contribu- tions are predicted to be greater at sampling 1 whereas for the bathroom tiles contributions are suggested to be greater at sampling 2.

To identify compounds of microbial origin fromthe indoor environment a single molecular network was built using the spectral data obtained from all the indoor samples spanning both sampling periods and the lab- grown community cultures.Analysis of the network revealed the presence of 2369 detectable compounds.

By manipulating variables such as growth sub- strate food source water availability and microbial in- oculum we can expand our understanding of the factors that determine the chemical ecology of indoor surfaces.ConclusionsAn initial examination of the chemical and microbial mi- lieu of household surfaces highlights that there is much to learn about the surfaces of the environments in which we live.

The different approaches to study microbial life on household surfaces revealed complemen- tary results and highlighted that much of the chemical ecol- ogy of homes remains uncharacterized.MicrobiotaTo the naked eye the bathroom tiles appeared to be clean surfaces while the kitchen coupons had visible areas of dried surface film material.

As such the different coupons and tiles were divided among the analytical targets such thatfor each sampling period analyses were based on at least two samples per sampling location.

Consistent with this observation there were remarkably fewer compounds specific to the bathroom tiles than the kitchen coupons and these bathroom compounds corre- sponded to groups of compounds such as sulfoxides cyclic amides and other acids and esters.
