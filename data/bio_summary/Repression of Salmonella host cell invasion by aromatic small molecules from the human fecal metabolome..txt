therefore we repeated the same experiment growing salmonella in the absence or presence of 100 um 34-dimethylbenzoic acid to assess hila expression this time however we used the wild-type salmonella strain sl1344 and measured hila expression through real-time329.103062 3m-hhydroquinoneohpyrocatecholohohoho-coumaric acid2-hydroxycinnamic acid327.086843 2m-hm-coumaric acidtrans-3-hydroxycinnamic acidphenylpyruvic acidooohooohohhydrocinnamic acidphenylpropionic acid299.128867 2m-h34-dimethylbenzoic acidmethylphenylacetic acid m-tolylacetic acidbenzyl acetateoohoohoch3oooch3ch3ch3ch3fig 5 molecular structures of the compounds tested for bioactivity against hila expression.

hydroquinone pyrocatechol o-coumaric acid m-coumaric acid phenylpyruvic acid hydrocinnamic acid 2-phenylpropionic acid 34-dimethylbenzoic acid 3-methylphenylacetic acid and benzyl acetate were all obtained from sigma-aldrich and were 97 pure.

as can be seen in  culturing salmonella in medium containing 34-dimethylbenzoic acid reduced its ability to invade human epithelial cells hela cells by 82 p  0.00000000000012. therefore 34-dimethylbenzoic acid inhibits not only hila expression but the expression of the entire spi-1 as well as the capacity of salmonella to invade nonphagocytic host cells.discussionmicrobes are constantly sensing and responding to signals from their surroundings a phenomenon that is critical to their survival .

o-coumaric acid hydrocin- namic acid 3-methylphenylacetic acid and 34-dimethylbenzoic acid all significantly inhib- ited hila expression .

among the aromatic compounds tested four elicited significant repression of hila o-coumaric acid hydrocinnamic acid 3-methylphenylacetic acid and 34-dimethylbenzoic acid.

of these 34-dimethylbenzoic acid showed the strongest activity repressing hila expression by 51 p  0.0001.34-dimethylbenzoic acid is a strong repressor of hila expression.

similarly the sample containing the boiled fecal extract inhibited hila expression by 73 and this inhibition was also statistically significant p  0.00016. the difference between the effects of the untreated and boiled extracts on hila expression was not statistically significant p  0.60. these data show that the fecal extract is highly stable at high temperatures in agreement with a potential aromatic nature of the bioactive compound.commercially available aromatic compounds recapitulate the hila inhibitory activity of the fecal extract.

however culturing salmonella st010 in 10 25 50 100 and 250 um 34-dimethylbenzoic acid resulted in a significant reduction in hila expression.

to determine if this was the case we cultured salmonella sl1344 with or without 34-dimethylbenzoic acid and determined the relative transcript levels of not only hila but also the genes sprb prgk invh sipa and hilc through rt-pcr.

shows that the expression of all genes tested was significantly repressed by 34-dimethylbenzoic acid indicating that not only hila but the entire spi-1 is repressed when salmonella is grown in the presence of this aromatic compound.

in order to confirm the activity of 34-dimethylbenzoic acid as an inhibitor of hila expression we performed dose-response studies to evaluate the effect of increasing concentrations of this compound on hila expression.

in the rt-pcr experiments 34-dimethylbenzoic acid reduced hila tran- script levels by 88 an effect that was also statistically significant p  0.0003.34-dimethylbenzoic acid represses expression of spi-1 and invasion of nonphagocytic host cells.

in these experiments 34-dimethylbenzoic acid caused a repression of 93 of the transcripta180160140120100806040200b11005010015020025034-dimethylbenzoic acid concentration umc1.21.00.80.60.40.20fig 6 aromatic compounds from the human fecal metabolome repress hila expression.

of these 34-dimethylbenzoic acid showed the strongest effect inhibiting hila expression by approximately 10-fold as determined by rt-pcr assays.very little can be found in the literature regarding 34-dimethylbenzoic acid.

supporting this notion we have previously shown that an antibiotic treatment regimen that increases the suscep- tibility of mice to infection by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium here referred to simply as salmonella by approximately 1000-fold also causes major disturbances in the chemical landscape of the intestinal tract .
