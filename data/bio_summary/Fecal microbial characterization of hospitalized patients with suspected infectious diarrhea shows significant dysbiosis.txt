To compare the microbiome composition of the hospitalized Israeli patients to that of healthy individ- uals we used data from a healthy adult Israeli populationaged 17-80 Israeli healthy 1 and a local cohort of healthy volunteers Israeli healthy 2 Supplementary Table .

Data from healthy individuals were obtained from a healthy adult Israeli cohortIsraeli healthy 1 and local healthy volunteers' Israeli healthy 2 fecal samples were collected and analyzed similarly to the hospitalized samples.

showed that hospitalized Israeli samples had significant higher b-diversity than the healthy Israeli population by cohort Bonferroni corrected Mann Whitney test q 1.3e-2 between hospi- talized and healthy 1  2.

Interestingly we noted a significant lower helicobacter from the Campylobacteraceae family in hospitalized Israeli cohort in comparison Israeli healthy 1 but higher abundance of Helicobacter was noted in Israeli healthy 2.High Proteobacteria abundance seen by 16S-seq cannot be explained by positive stool cul- ture results.

As the Israeli healthy adult dataincluded repeating samples from some individuals samples with a UniFracscore under 0.05 similarity to other samples within the dataset were removed.

showed no significant difference between hospitalized Israeli and the healthy Israeli population by cohort Bonferroni corrected Mann Whitney q  0.39 between hospitalized and healthy 1  2. b-diversity between cohorts Fig.

Fold change of significant associations between the Israel hospitalized cohort relative to Israeli healthy 1 and Israeli healthy 2 for specific taxa at the genus level was calculated for the Proteobacteria taxa Fig.

MaAsLin analysis was performed for younger 4 versus older 18-70 ages within the hospitalized Israeli population while controlling for gender and for Israeli hospi- talized and Israeli healthy 1 while controlling for gender and age group 0-4 4-18 18-70 and 70.

A fold change greater than one represents an increase in hospitalized Israeli patients and lower than one a decrease in hospitalized Israeli patients compared to the other cohorts.

We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the global pattern of microbial composition of fecal samples from 196 hospitalized patients with suspected infectious diarrhea in comparisonto healthy non-hospitalized subjects n 881 and to traditional culture results.
