Of these eight were significantly increased in CD patients alanine beta-alanine phe- nylacetic acid 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid glyceric acid phenylethylamine putrescine and cadaverine and six metabolites significantly decreased in CD patients nicotinic acid pantothenic acid 3-methyladipic acid 5b-coprostanol 3-hydroxybutyric acid and hydrocinnamic acid.Regarding the comparison between UC patients and healthy controls sixteen metabolites were able todiscriminate between the two groups Fig.

Spearman correlation between statistically different metabolites and bacterial genera was calculated both for CD a and UC b. Spearman correlation between statistically different metabolites and bacterial species was calculated both for CD c and UC d. Correlations with an r coefficient 0.5 are shown.inflammation.

The highest incidences of CD and UC have been reported in northern Europe the United Kingdom and North America with a greater incidence of UC than CD.

The high levels of amino acids such as alanine beta-alanine and phenylalanine in the feces of CD patients might in part result from malabsorption due to inflammation in these patients or reflect an increase of the producing bacteria.Two group B vitamins nicotinic acid and pantothenic acid significantly decreased in feces of CD patients.

The concentration of phe- nylethylamine increased in feces of CD patients suggesting that the depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii could lead to an increase of some amine which in turn could play a role in the pathogenesis of an inflammatory process.The amount of methylamine decreased in the aqueous fecal water extracts of patients with CD.

The analysis showed how CD and UC significant metabolites were involved in different pathways as pheny- lalanine glutathione and beta-alanine metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.

Discriminant metabolites were highlighted by the means of an S-plot and a Mann-Whitney test was carried out to find significant differences between the classes.Fourteen metabolites were detected to be responsible for the separation of the CD patients from the healthy control group Fig.

Amongst Proteobacteria Escherichia alberti resulted much more abundant than in controls 4.61 vs 0.24 in CD 3.28 vs 0.24 in UC and among Bactroidetes Prevotella copri was the main species reduced 0.02 vs 3.91 in CD 0.68 vs 3.91 in UC in both patient groups.Neither the diet nor the activity of disease did affect the microbiome composition.

The mean differences in the a-Shannon values between the CTLs the IBD and the CD and UC groups were always statistically different Fig.

The OPLS-DA score plot demonstrates clear separation between both CD patients and healthy controls and UC patients and healthy controls Fig.
