Thus our work suggests that C. fetus is an unappreciated human intestinal pathobiont likely spread by human to human transmission.

ARTICLE DOI 10.1038s41467-017-01449-9OPENDistinct Campylobacter fetus lineages adapted as livestock pathogens and human pathobionts in the intestinal microbiotaGregorio Iraola et al.Campylobacter fetus is a venereal pathogen of cattle and sheep and an opportunistic human pathogen.

Clusters 2 to 8 are mainly associated to non-bovine hosts with up to 100 of human strains hence are hereinafter referred as the human lineages.

Thus the accessory genomes of bovine and human lineages harbor distinct gene sets that are potentially important for genome evolution and host-pathogen interactions and likely reflect the adaptations to different hosts.Interestingly other accessory genes involved in blocking the incorporation of foreign DNA like Cas protein coding genes were more abundant in human lineages Supplementary Fig.

Surprisingly of the strains found from the human lineages TW2 represented 94 of strains found within healthy individuals suggesting clonal expansion of this genotype in the sampled human population Fig.

We also provide evidence that human- adapted C. fetus acts as an intestinal pathobiont capable of asymptomatic carriage and likely human to human transmission.

Here we show that mammalian C. fetus consists of distinct evolutionary lineages primarily associated with either human or bovine hosts.

We detect C. fetus genomes in 8 of healthy human fecal metagenomes where the human-associated lineages are the dominant type 78.

Despite the importance of CffCfv in livestock and human health its genomic evolution within mammals remains poorly understood.

Many important questions remain unanswered regarding the evolutionary relationship between strains isolated from bovine and human hosts the transmission patterns ofC.
