In a study comparing 7 different probiotic strains taken for 3 weeks B. lactis L. acidophilus L. plan- tarum and L. paracasei 2 1010 cfu each however improved responses to oral cholera vaccination were seen with only 3 of the 7 strains higher cholera-specific IgG levels 7 days after vacci- nation with B. lactis p  0.010 and L. acidophilus La-14 p  0.010 and higher cholera-specific IgA and IgM levels p  0.030 0.020 14 days after vaccination with L. acidophilus NCFM .

The two other studies did not find any effect of probiotics on specific IgG levels to routine vaccinations one for diphtheria tetanus pertus- sis poliomyelitis and HBV-specific IgG and one for HBV-specific IgG .Effect of probiotics on vaccine responses in childrenFive studies that included 541 children reported on vaccine responses after administration of probiotics started beyond the neonatal period .

DiscussionIn our systematic review of the studies that have reported the effect of probiotics on the humoral response to either parenteral or oral vaccinations a beneficial effect was reported in about half in 3 of 7 studies investigating parental vaccinations in neonates and children  in 5 of 12 investigating responses to influ- enza vaccination  in the one study investigation response to hepatitis A vaccination  and in 3 of 5 studies assessing oral vaccinations in children and adults .
