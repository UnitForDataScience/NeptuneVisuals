discussionin our systematic review of the studies that have reported the effect of probiotics on the humoral response to either parenteral or oral vaccinations a beneficial effect was reported in about half in 3 of 7 studies investigating parental vaccinations in neonates and children  in 5 of 12 investigating responses to influ- enza vaccination  in the one study investigation response to hepatitis a vaccination  and in 3 of 5 studies assessing oral vaccinations in children and adults .

future studies should focus on establishing optimal strains doses and timing of administration in relation to vaccination.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.contentsintroduction207systematic search method208results208effect of probiotics on vaccine responses in neonates208effect of probiotics on vaccine responses in children208effect of probiotics administered during pregnancy on vaccine responses in infants208effect of probiotics on vaccine responses in adults210effect of different doses and strains211discussion211acknowledgement211competing interests211conflict of interest211authors' contributions212references2121.

the dose of pro- biotic used in each study varied between 108 and 1013 colony forming units cfu per day.effect of probiotics on vaccine responses in neonatesthe effect of probiotic administration to neonates on humoral vaccine responses has been investigated in 4 studies in a total of573 infants.

twelve of these studies investigated the response to influenza vaccination  one study the response to hepatitis a vaccination and three the response to oral vaccinations cholera  polio  andsalmonella typhi .

the remaining two reported no effect of probiotics on responses to measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccination and to tetanus and pneumococcocal vaccination respectively .

we systematically reviewed prospective randomised placebo-controlled studies in humans that have investigated the effect of probiotics on humoral vaccine responses.we found 26 studies involving 3812 participants investigating the effect of 40 different probiotic strains on the response to 17 different vaccines.

the one study that investigated the effect of probiotic administration to mothers during pregnancy found lower vaccine response in infants .some of the variation in the reported effect of probiotics in the studies in our review is likely to result from the substantial varia- tion between studies in the choice of probiotics strain dose viabil- ity purity and duration and timing of administration.
