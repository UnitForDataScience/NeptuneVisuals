Furthermore we cannot exclude that isolates obtained here contain other virulence genes that were not targeted in the present study.Finally the clonal relationship and population structure BAPs groups found in E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates indicated that the vast majority of our E. faecium isolates clustered in subgroups 2.1a and 3.3a2 representing separate hospital lineages that belong to clade A1 that contains most nosocomial E. faecium isolates Willems et al.

The majority of the STs belonged to BAPS group 2.1a 18 isolates and 15 of them were resistantto ampicillin ST117 n  12 ST78 n  2 and ST730 n  1.Other sub-groups observed included BAPS 1.2 2 isolates as well as BAPS 3.3a2 3 isolates.

Three out of these four ST589 isolates carried the ermB gene.From the group of E. faecalis isolates belonging to ST6 n 6 three carried ermB asa and esp genes and were susceptible toampicillin whereas the other three isolates displayed resistance to ampicillin.

2016.The clinical isolates causing nosocomial infections in the patients included in our study were not available for further analysis which limited the possibility to clarify whether the infections derived from the isolates colonizing the patient in that period and whether the isolates obtained from fecal material correspond to a nosocomial acquisition or selection of strains that were present in the gut microbiota of these patients priorto hospitalization.

Furthermore 30 out of 41 isolates harbored the erm B gene mainly present in E. faecium isolates 78.

In this study we characterized Enterococcus isolates colonizing the intestinal tract of ICU patients receiving SDD therapy and to evaluate in more detail the genetic relatedness of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates using MLST and Bayesian analysis of the population structure BAPS.

The most commonly found species were E. faecium 23 isolates and E. faecalis 13 isolates.

In the patients substantial shifts in the absolute enterococcal 16S rRNA gene copy number were observed during the hospitalization period Figure 2.Antimicrobial SusceptibilityAll isolates were vancomycin-susceptible MIC 0.5-2 ugml except for a single vancomycin resistant MIC 16 ugml isolate closely related to E. gallinarum E.sp3 99 nucleotide identity.Ampicillin resistance was detected in 25 out of 41 isolates with the highest prevalence of resistant strains being found amongstE.

The asa1 gene was frequently present in E. faecalis isolates n  713 whereas the esp gene was more often found in E. faecium isolates n  1723.

2008 was not detected in any of the isolates Figure 1.Clonal Relatedness and Analysis of Population StructureUsing MLST we established the clonal relationship of all E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates obtained in this study.
