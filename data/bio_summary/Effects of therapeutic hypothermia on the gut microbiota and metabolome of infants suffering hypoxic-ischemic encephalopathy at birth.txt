High inter-individual variation was observed between the control and HIE treated group however analysis of microbial diversity found a significant decrease in the alpha diversity of our HIE treated group suggesting that TBC may affect microbial richness in later life.

No significant differences were found using the Chao 1 diversity index however the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were found to be significantly higher in the control group p  0.038 compared to the HIE treated group.

Thus it is reasonable to suggest that this type of treatment at birth could impact the development of the gut microbiome.Findings from this study suggest that TBC in treating HIE at birth had no significant effect on the gut microbial composition or me- tabolic profile of infants at 2 years of age.

At phylum level Firmicutes was found to be the dominant phylum in both groups however at family level the abundance of Lachnospiriaceae was found to be significantly higher in the HIE treated group 52.22 compared to the control group 36.38 p  0.0172.

To determine whether the microbial dataset correlated with the metabolic data co-inertia analysis was carried out using the ade4 package in 'R' using the Monte-Carlo test to generate an RV coefficient.Results16S microbial compositionDiversity measuresDuring the course of this study a total of 17 faecal samples were collected from infants at 2 years of age and subjected to 16S rRNA analysis.

In addition a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroides was found in our HIE treated group with an increased relative abundance of Lachnospiriaceae.

Indeed at genus level high inter-individual variation was observed between both groups.In the control group Bifidobacterium and Blautia were present at an average relative abundance of 15.07 and 9.16 respectively however the relative abundance of these genera were found to be inverted in the HIE treated group with an average relative abun- dance of Bifidobacterium at 9.16 and Blautia at 15.49.

Moreover production of these particular microbial by-products has been found to improve colonocyte health and mucosal immunity .Overall results from this study suggest that there is no impact onthe gut microbial development of infants subjected to TBC at birth compared to a healthy full term infant group at 2 years of life.
