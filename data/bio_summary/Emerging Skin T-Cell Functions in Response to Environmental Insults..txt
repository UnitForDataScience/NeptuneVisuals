Both CD8 and CD4 T cells the latter comprising regulatory T cells TREG and nonregulatory T cells exhibit strong tropism for the hair follicle region Figure 1 suggesting that the hair follicle is critical in regulating skin residence of these tissue-resident memory T cells TRM Chow et al.

The critical roles of ab and gd T cells in the contexts of defense against skin infections host-microbiome interactions and skin damage will be discussed in this review article.Suwanpradid et al.Page 3THE CUTANEOUS T-CELL REPERTOIRE IN HUMAN SKINBoth epidermal and dermal gd and ab T cells are present in noninflamed human skinhowever cutaneous gd T cells are approximately 300 times less abundant than ab T cells Clark et al.

The composition and function of cutaneous T cells can change dramatically onenvironmental insults and may be driven by both antigen exposure and innate immune signals derived from surrounding keratinocytes dendritic cells macrophages and other cells Iwasaki and Medzhitov 2015 Schroder et al.

Notably in response to C. albicans stimulation skin-homing T cells isolated from human blood produce IL-9 to enhance effector function of IL-9-producing T helper type 9 Th9 cells and other effector T cells.

Langerhans cells protect from allergic contact dermatitis in mice by tolerizing CD8 T cells and activating Foxp3 regulatory T cells.

Dynamics and function of Langerhans cells in vivo dermal dendritic cells colonize lymph node areas distinct from slower migrating Langerhans cells.

The heterogeneity of cutaneous-resident T cells in murine and human skin is highlighted in Table 1.T CELLS IN MURINE SKINIn a steady state murine T cells reside predominantly at the epidermal-dermal junction Figure 1.

The epidermis contains a unique population of gd T cells called dendritic epidermal T cells DETCs Havran et al.

2001.Under homeostatic conditions ab TCR T cells comprise approximately 40-50 of all dermal T cells Cai et al.

Epidermal TRM are comprised predominantly of CD8 T cells and similar to DETCs these cells typically bear the a-chain of the integrin aEb7 and CD103 and express the activation marker CD69 Adachi et al.
