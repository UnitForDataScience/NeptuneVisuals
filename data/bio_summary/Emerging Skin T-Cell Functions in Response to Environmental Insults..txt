Both CD8 and CD4 T cells the latter comprising regulatory T cells TREG and nonregulatory T cells exhibit strong tropism for the hair follicle region Figure 1 suggesting that the hair follicle is critical in regulating skin residence of these tissue-resident memory T cells TRM Chow et al.

The critical roles of ab and gd T cells in the contexts of defense against skin infections host-microbiome interactions and skin damage will be discussed in this review article.Suwanpradid et al.Page 3THE CUTANEOUS T-CELL REPERTOIRE IN HUMAN SKINBoth epidermal and dermal gd and ab T cells are present in noninflamed human skinhowever cutaneous gd T cells are approximately 300 times less abundant than ab T cells Clark et al.

Notably in response to C. albicans stimulation skin-homing T cells isolated from human blood produce IL-9 to enhance effector function of IL-9-producing T helper type 9 Th9 cells and other effector T cells.

T cell populations primed by hapten sensitization in contact sensitivity are distinguished by polarized patterns of cytokine production interferon gamma- producing Tc1 effector CD8 T cells and interleukin Il 4Il-10-producing Th2 negative regulatory CD4 T cells.

Langerhans cells protect from allergic contact dermatitis in mice by tolerizing CD8 T cells and activating Foxp3 regulatory T cells.

The heterogeneity of cutaneous-resident T cells in murine and human skin is highlighted in Table 1.T CELLS IN MURINE SKINIn a steady state murine T cells reside predominantly at the epidermal-dermal junction Figure 1.

The epidermis contains a unique population of gd T cells called dendritic epidermal T cells DETCs Havran et al.
