The present study investigated the colonization charac- teristics of Phascolarctobacterium faecium in healthy individuals 1-80 years old in Southern China.

The colonization rate varied between 43.33-93.33 and the abundance of Phascolarctobacterium faecium ranged between 3.22-5.76 log cells g-1 1 years old and 3.06-9.33 log cells g-1 1 year old.

The permillage of Phascolarctobacterium faecium in total bacteria ranged between 0.004-1.479.

The results of the present study demonstrated that Phascolarctobacterium faecium is abundantly colonized in the human gastrointestinal tract.IntroductionThe human gut microbiota is composed of 400-500 species of microbes.

The gene pool of the microbial habitants of the gut is extremely diverse and considerably larger than the gene pool of the host which determines a number of metabolic capacities of the bacteria that are essential for the survival of these organisms in the gut 134.In recent years high throughput sequencing technolo- gies have revealed the correlation between gut microbiota and the host.

The bacterial compo- sition can also be affected by the diet.

The sequence similarity was analyzed with the EzTaxon-e-server 13.

The GenBank program of NCBI BLAST showed that both the primers were specific to theP.

The primers PF1 5'GGCGGCTTAATAAGTCGA GC3' and PF2 5'CGTTCGCTACCCTGGCTTTC3' ampli- fied a 200 bp amplicon.Primers for examining the species specificity.

The specificity was further confirmed by the DNAFigure 1.
