In all dietary comparisons L-H L-LSO H-HSO the absence of significant results P  0.3 suggested that bacteria alone do not fulfil a central role in network formation.We further tested whether bacteria interact more within their own domain as compared to interactions with ciliate protozoa fungi or archaea.

Net- works added new dimensions to our understanding of the diet effect on rumen microbial community interactions.collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.IntroductionThe rumen contains a highly complex microbial ecosystem comprising several thousand species of bacteria  of which 30 groups are dominant  12 genera of ciliate protozoa  6 genera of anaerobic fungi  and approximately 10 main taxa of methanogenic archaea  as well as variable abundances of mycoplasmas bacteriophages archaeophages and viruses that infect the eukaryotic microorganisms.

Among four domain interactions no robust correlations were observed between bacteria and archaea but active interaction was detected between bac- teria-fungi and bacteria-ciliate protozoa.In the H-HSO comparison the density of connections within bacteria was higher 2.54 as compared with the density of connections within archaea and ciliate protozoa 1.73 or in the total set 1.81.

However no connections were observed between ciliate protozoa and archaea and only one was found between protozoa and bacteria.DiscussionPrevious studies across a wide range of habitats have demonstrated that network based approaches can help in predicting the dynamics and structure of oceanic plankton ecosystems  reveal relations within microbial communities in soil  or highlight differences in taxa interactions within the human gut in health and disease .

The funder had no role in study design dataAbstractThe ruminal microbiome comprising large numbers of bacteria ciliate protozoa archaea and fungi responds to diet and dietary additives in a complex way.

Total genomic DNA was extracted from combined d 22 and d 24 sub-samples following the protocol of Yu and Morrison .Quantitative real-time PCR analysisThe total amounts of bacteria archaea ciliate protozoa and fungi were measured by qPCR.

The absolute quantity of test samples was esti- mated against serial dilutions of DNA standards amplified to generate calibration curves.Methods used to generate standards for bacteria archaea ciliate protozoa and fungi are described in detail in .
