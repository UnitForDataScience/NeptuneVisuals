Experiments were performed in accordance with the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals The State Science and Technology Commission of P. R. China 1988.This study was part of a larger experimental trial investigating the effects of EML and SMFP on growth performance ruminal fermentation blood biochemical parameters and carcass characteristics of finishing steers - The experiment was done in the ex- perimental base of China Agricultural University.

The ingredients and nutrient composition of each diet are provided in Additional file Table S1 and in our previous report The animals were fed twice daily at approximately 0800 and 1700 h to meetthe NRC recommendations and had ad libitum access to water.

The samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 degC until genomic DNA was extracted.DNA extraction and sequencingTotal genomic DNA was extracted from 0.2 g of frozen fecal sample using a fecal DNA extraction toolkit Tiangen Biotech Co. Beijing China combining a bead- beat with an oscillator Precellys 24 Bertin Technology Montigny-le-Bretonneux France plus column method The rotating speed of the oscillator was 5500 rpm with two circulations and 30 s per circulation.

The most abundant phyla for all 12 samples were Firmicutes 56.67 Bacteroidetes 35.90 Proteobac-teria 1.87 Verrucomicrobia 1.80 and Tenericutes 1.37 Table The minor phyla accounting for less than 1 of the bacterial communities was Lentisphaerae 0.43 and the other known phyla account for 1.96 of the total sequences.

The results of the Illumina MiSeq sequencing analyses revealed that addition of EML and SMFP to the feed did not affect the alpha or beta diversity of fecal bacteria Table The ACE and Chao1 indices were cal- culated to compare species richness by estimating the minimum number of unique OTUs for each sample.

Previous stud- ies have compared the dry matter digestibility of several grape pomace varieties in cows sheep and goats in vitro - and in vivo experiments have investigated feeds such as apple pomace silage which is used for sheep and potato pomace which is used as protein supple- ment for growing lambs Mulberry pomace which is a byproduct of mulberry juice consists mainly of peels Correspondence 1State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Beijing 100193 People's Republic of China2College of Animal Science and Technology China Agricultural University Beijing 100193 People's Republic of Chinaand stems and accounts for approximately 8 of the fresh weight of the mulberry - In our previous study we found that ensiled mulberry leaves EMLc The Authors.

The intestinal microbiome of cattle plays a critical role not only in animal health and productivity but also in food safety and environmental protection A previ- ous survey suggested that bovine fecal bacterial commu- nity structures can dramatically differ at the phylum and family levels depending on the animal feed.

The protocol was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of China Agricultural University Permit No.DK1008.

The control group CON received standard TMR the EML received a standard diet containing EML and the sun-dried mulberry fruit pomace group SMFP received a standard diet containing SMFP Additional file  Table S1.
