The fold change of transcript levels of abaecin defensin1 and hyme- noptaecin revealed a high level at Day-3 post treatment that declined thereafter and remained relatively constant over the eleven-day time-course of the experiment.The disruption of bacteria in the honey bee by antibiotic treatment could increase the honey bee's susceptibility to Nosema infectionThe relative quantities of N. ceranae in infected bees in Group IV was signficantly higher than that in Group II at each time point post treatment t-test Day-3 t  4.464 df  10.256 P  0.001 Day -7 t  14.105 df  16 P0.001 Day-11 t  19.407 df  16 P0.001 .The Nosema proliferated steadily over the course of time of the experiment in infected bees of Group IV in relation to the titer of Nosema in bees of Group II indicating that the bacteria in honey bee could play a significant role in the honey bee's resistance to the growth and replica- tion of N. ceranae .Antibiotic treatment and Nosema infection could cause cumulative and synergistic detrimental effects on the lifespan of honey beesOf the four groups the bees in Group I had the highest survival rate and longest survival time while bees in Group IV had the lowest .

There was not statistically significant difference in the quantity of total bacteria and seven phylotypes between Group I and Group II at day 3 day 7 and day 11 after eclosion suggesting that Nosema infection did not significantly impact the abundance and type of bacteria in honey bees.The disruption of bacteria in honey bees by antibiotic treatment could negatively impact the expression levels of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides abaecin defensin1 and hymenoptaecinThe fold change values of expression levels of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides AMPs abaecin defensin1 and hymenoptaecin showed significant differences across the four experi- mental groups at each time point post treatment  One-Way ANOVA 3 days post treatment for abaecin F347  38.935 P0.001 for defensin1 F347  33.748 P0.001 for hymenoptaecin F347  10.074 P0.001 7 days post treatment for abaecin F347  6.403P  0.003 for defensin1 F347  5.216 P  0.004 for hymenoptaecin F347  15.140 P0.001 11 days post treatment abaecin F347  10.078 P0.001 for defensin1 F347  6.110 P  0.002 for hymenoptaecin F347  24.126 P0.001 .

Also the fold change in terms of 16s rRNA expression between Group I and Group II was significantly greater at day 7 and day 11 than at day 3  .Nosema infection does not significantly impact the abundance and type of bacteria in honey beeThe relative quantification of the total bacteria and specific bacteria phylotypes in Group I and Group II without antibiotic treatment confirmed the presence of bacterial phylotypesDisruption of bacterial activity in honey bee by antibiotic treatment.

Our study showed that the negative impacts of Nosema infection on the honey bee immune function and lifespan were exacerbated by antibiotic treatment because of the effects on the gut microbiota.Collectively the results of this study emphasize the importance of commensal gut bacteria in regulating honey bees' susceptibility to N. ceranae infection the risk of the disruption of gut bacteria by antibiotics in altering the proper function of host immune system and the urgency of developing new disease therapeutic strategies that can help ameliorate the destruction of beneficial bacteria by antibiotics thus promoting honeybee health.

The qPCR quantification of total bacteria and specific bacteria phylotypes showed no statistically significant difference in the quantity of total bacteria between Group I and Group II at day 3 day 7 and day 11 after eclosion Paired t-test t  0.948 df  2 P  0.443.

The relative quantifiation of the total bacteria and specific bacteria phylotypes including a-Proteobacteria r-Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes FirmicutesActinobacteria Snodgrassella alvi Gilliamella apicola in Groups I and Group II without antibiotic treatment was estimated by qPCR with 16S rDNA universal primers and phylotypes specific 16S rDNA primers individually.

The gut microbiota-mediated host immune regulation especially by initially colo- nized gut bacteria was reported previously in honey bee mice and humans    - suggesting that the acquisition and establishment of bacteria population occurs shortly after birth or eclosion.

The gut bacterial community in the hindgut of honey bee adult workers accounts for 95 of all gut bacteria while the crop honey stomach or foregut is colonized by a small population of bacteria  .

This result is consistent with previous studies -   and provides additional experimental evidence that gut bacteria are closely linked to the proper functioning of the immune system and the depletion of gut bacteria could lead to negative regulation of the innate immune response in honey bees.Nosema is a virulent honey bee pathogen that has been suggested as one of the key contribu- tors to increased honey bee colony losses worldwide - .

The relative abundance of total bacteria and specific bacterial phylotypes at each time point post treatment was expressed as an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator.The statistical significance of relative quantification of each target gene at each time point post treatment among the different groups was analyzed by using SPSS PASW Statistics 18 SPSS Inc..
