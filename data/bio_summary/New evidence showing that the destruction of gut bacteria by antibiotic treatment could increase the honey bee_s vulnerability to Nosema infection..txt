our study showed that the negative impacts of nosema infection on the honey bee immune function and lifespan were exacerbated by antibiotic treatment because of the effects on the gut microbiota.collectively the results of this study emphasize the importance of commensal gut bacteria in regulating honey bees' susceptibility to n. ceranae infection the risk of the disruption of gut bacteria by antibiotics in altering the proper function of host immune system and the urgency of developing new disease therapeutic strategies that can help ameliorate the destruction of beneficial bacteria by antibiotics thus promoting honeybee health.

this result is consistent with previous studies -   and provides additional experimental evidence that gut bacteria are closely linked to the proper functioning of the immune system and the depletion of gut bacteria could lead to negative regulation of the innate immune response in honey bees.nosema is a virulent honey bee pathogen that has been suggested as one of the key contribu- tors to increased honey bee colony losses worldwide - .

the gut microbiota-mediated host immune regulation especially by initially colo- nized gut bacteria was reported previously in honey bee mice and humans    - suggesting that the acquisition and establishment of bacteria population occurs shortly after birth or eclosion.

the gut bacterial community in the hindgut of honey bee adult workers accounts for 95 of all gut bacteria while the crop honey stomach or foregut is colonized by a small population of bacteria  .

further studies showed that gut microbiota could affect honey bee growth hor- monal signaling behavior sugar metabolism and pollen digestion    revealing diverse metabolic functions of gut bacteria that are likely to contribute to bee growth and health.nosema.

previ- ous studies confirmed that these bacterial species are largely restricted to honeybees and other bee species including the asian honey bees a. cerana and some bumble bee species reflect- ing a long-term coevolutionary history of the sister bee species  .insects including honey bees lack acquired immune response but have evolved effective immune responses to combat infection by pathogens -.

studies involved the european honey bee apis mel- lifera which is neither an endangered nor protected species.the experimental honey bee colonies established from commercial packages were reared in the bee research laboratory apiaries.
