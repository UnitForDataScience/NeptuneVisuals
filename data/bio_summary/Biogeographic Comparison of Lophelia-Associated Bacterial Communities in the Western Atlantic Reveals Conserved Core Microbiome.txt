The lower proportion of Novosphingobium and Pseudonocardia in ATL samples   is likely the driver behind lower functional predictions of xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism for those samples vs. Gulf of Mexico samples .DISCUSSIONStudies on the stability of tropical coral-associated bacterial communities have found that temporal     and geographic               effects do occur but that species-specificity can still be detected            .

While several Gulf of Mexico samples had higher relative abundance of Pseudonocardiaceae  Atlantic samples also contained other actinobacterial species Actinomyces and Microbacterium in their local or individual microbiomes  at less than 1 total relative abundance.The dominant bacterial phylum detected in L. pertusa was Proteobacteria which corroborates prior work conducted using clone libraries     as well as pyrosequencing targeting the V1-V3   and V4   variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene.

and 3 an environmentally variable bacterial community    .We hypothesize that there is a conserved core of bacterial symbionts held in common by all L. pertusa while the rest of the bacterial community varies depending on local environmental characteristics such as dominant food source benthic community structure or water mass parameters.

By examining more than 40000 sequences per sample we found that GOM samples were dominated by the identified conserved core sequences whereas open Atlantic samples had a much higher proportion of locally consistent bacteria.
