Supporting these observations flow cytometry of the skin showed a nearly 10-fold increase in CD4th T-cell number in R26STAT3CstopflthCD4Cre mice compared with control animals d. Deep sequencing of the T-cell repertoire suggested that the disease remained polyclonal see Supplementary Figure S8 online consistent with early MF  since advanced CTCL often shows expansion of a clonal subpopulation .Along with the augmented number of T cells in the skin enlarged lymph nodes of R26STAT3CstopflthCD4Cre mice had dramatically increased numbers of CD4th T cells e. T cells isolated from secondary lymphoid organs of R26STAT3CstopflthCD4Cre mice exhibited an increase in activatedmemory CD4th T cells CD44hiCD62Llo see Supplementary Figure S9a and b online and had a greaterpercentage of proliferating CD4th T cells as indicated by pos- itive staining for the Ki67 antigen f. Flow cytometry analysis of cytokine expression in CD4th T cells from the skin of R26STAT3Cstopflth CD4Cre mice showed a dramatic in- crease in IL-17e and IL-22eproducing T cells compared with control animals a and b.

Principal compo- nent analysis showed that although the memory and naive T-cell populations from healthy individuals clustered with their respective cell types tumor samples were widely spread across the principal component analysis plot highlighting the molecular heterogeneity of this disease c. Silhouette analysis performed to measure the degree of similarity be- tween clusters underscored the heterogeneity of the tumor cluster c. Both the MF and SS forms of CTCL are thought to arise from malignant transformation of memory T lymphocytes and indeed this is consistent with our principal component analysis because the malignant cells are closer to memory T cells along PC1 than they are to naive T lym- phocytes.

Using this mouse model we show that T-cell receptor engagement is critical for malignant transformation of the T lymphocytes and that progression of the disease is dependent on microbiota.Journal of Investigative Dermatology 2017 - -e- INTRODUCTIONCutaneous T-cell lymphoma CTCL is a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas characterized by the accumu- lation of malignant T lymphocytes in the skin  .

The observed diverse genetic aberrations converged on common cancer-associated signaling pathways in SS with many CNVs associated with the ERKMAPK NF-kB PI3K- AKT TP53 and STAT3 signaling pathways see Supplementary Figure S3 online.Transcriptome analysis shows a distinct CTCL gene expression signatureWe next examined the gene expression profile of sorted T cells from patient tumor samples compared with naive and memory T cells from healthy individuals.

Analysis of differential gene expression between the transformed T cells and memory T cells yielded a gene expression signature which we trimmed down to 124 genes up-regulated in SS cells based on Q-value  bbyang ggassQiao Ji Qiao Qiao 0.05 and fold difference in expression 4 d and see Supplementary Table S1 online.

The frequency of IFN-geproducing cells in the skin was not significantly different however we observed a lower frequency of IL-4eproducing cells in the skin of mutant mice see Supplementary Figure S9c and d. Consistent with the previously reported finding that STAT3 directly pro- moted RORgt transcription  we observed a greater number of RORgtthIL-17e and RORgtthIL-17th cells in the skin and lymph nodes of R26STAT3CstopflthCD4Cre compared with littermate controls see Supplementary Figure S9e and f. Indeed up-regulation of STAT3 in malig- nant T cells of CTCL patients may explain the high frequency of Th17 cells often observed in this malignancy   and may contribute to the inflammatory skin microenvironment in this disease.To further assess the relevancy of our mouse model to human disease we examined the transcriptional profile of CD4th T cells isolated from the skin of R26STAT3Cstopflth CD4Cre mice.

As shown in c gene set enrichment analysis reflected that malignant T cells from the skin of R26STAT3Cstopflth CD4Cre mice had a distinct altered tran- scriptional pattern compared with CD4th T cells sorted from the skin of control animals and that our previously charac- terized see Supplementary Table S1 human CTCL gene expression signature was readily identifiable in the lympho- cytes from mutant mice.Disease progression in a CTCL mouse model is dependent on TCR signaling and the presence of microbiotaCutaneous lymphomas are unique in that the malignant cells localize to surfaces where environmental exposure in the form of pathogens or irritants may contribute to CTCL pathogenesis.
