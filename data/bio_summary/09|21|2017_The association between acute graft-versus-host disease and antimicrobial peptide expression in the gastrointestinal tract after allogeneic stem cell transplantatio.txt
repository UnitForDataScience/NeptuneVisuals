interestingly we found also significantly higher reg3a expression in the small intestine 3.3x101 5.1x10-4 to 2.6x102 than in the stomach 1.5x10-1 1.9x10-2 to 8.3x101 p  0.001 or large intestine 3.1x10-3 3.1x10-5 to 9.2x101 p0.001 .levels of paneth cell amps correlate with the severity of acute gi gvhdnext we investigated the impact of acute gi gvhd on the relative expression of paneth cell amps in acute gi gvhd.

severe gi gvhd in both the lower and the upper gi tract also correlated with higher serum concentrations of reg3a p  0.002. as indirect markers of intestinal microbiome diversity low levels of uri- nary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels were associated with severe stages of acute gi gvhd com- pared to mild stage or no acute gi gvhd p  0.05. in conclusion acute gi gvhd correlates with intestinal expression of hd5 hd6 and reg3a as well as reg3a serum levels and is associated with intestinal dysbiosis.number 315963 dfg kfo 243 he 31167-2german jose' carreras foundation project gvhd competence center regensburg and the german research foundation dfg ge 67114-1. the funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist.introductionthe gut microbiota play a central role in the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation asct.

histopathologythe number of paneth cells was determined with a zeiss axioskop 40 microscope in hematox- ylin and eosin he stained sections of intestinal biopsies of the duodenum n  51. addition- ally the number of paneth cells was assessed in a randomly chosen cohort of 22 patients with colon biopsies n  34. paneth cells were counted in at least 3 high-power fields hpf in the area of each biopsy showing the largest number of paneth cells.

statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 spss inc chicago il usa.resultsexpression of paneth cell amps differs between stomach small intestine and large intestinefor all three paneth cell amps reg3a hd5 und hd6 we found significant differences in relative expression between stomach small intestine and large intestine according to the physi- ological distribution of paneth cells in the gi tract.

accordingly mean paneth cell count in the large intestine wasrelative expression of paneth cell amps correlates with severity of acute gi gvhd.

however not only paneth cells are able to pro- duce amps also intestinal epithelial cells are able to secrete amps into the intestinal lumen in order to limit intestinal inflammation and to restore intestinal homeostasis  which might explain inflammatory induction in the large intestine during gvhd as found in our data.however in fact it cannot be ruled out that other factors e.g.

acute stage 2-4 gi gvhd was associated with reduced expression of amps in the small intestine ps0.01 in comparison to stage 0-1 disease accompanied by a decrease in paneth cell count in case of severe acute gi gvhd p0.001.

in acute gi gvhd the extent of paneth cell destruction has been observed to correlate with severity of acute gvhd.

severe stages of acute gi gvhd were associated with lower levels of 3-is with 0.001 mmolmmol creatinine 0 to 0.3 mmolmmol creatinine com- pared to 0.06 mmolmmol creatinine 0 to 99.0 mmolmmol creatinine in patients with mild stage or no acute gi gvhd p  0.05. the correlation of paneth cell number and 3-is showed a trend data not shown.

here in a retrospective analysis of 200 patients undergoing asct at the regensburg uni- versity medical center we assessed the relative expression of paneth cell antimicrobial peptides amps human defensins hd 5 and 6 and regenerating islet-derived 3a reg3a in 292 human intestinal biopsies as well as reg3a serum levels in relation to acute gi gvhd.

in this retrospective study of patients undergoing asct we analyzed relative gene expres- sion of paneth cell amps hd5 hd6 and reg3a in 292 intestinal biopsies and determined serum levels of reg3a in relation to acute gvhd of the gi tract.patients material and methodspatientsa total of 200 adult patients undergoing asct at the university hospital regensburg were included in our retrospective analysis.

severe gi gvhd in both the lower and the upper gi tract also correlated with higher serum concentrations of reg3a 161.5 ngml 8.5- 1744.0 ngml as compared to mild gi gvhd 63.2 ngml 4.5-2296 ngml p  0.002. due to the low number of stomach biopsies an analysis of gvhd changes in amp secretion was not possible for this subgroup of patients.severe acute gi gvhd and paneth cell number correlate with loss of microbiome diversityas indirect markers of intestinal microbiome diversity urinary 3-is levels were measured within 14 days of biopsy harvesting.

our analyses of paneth cell amps in intestinal biopsies of patients with acute gi gvhd showed an opposing correlation of gvhd and relative amp expression in the small intestine compared to the large intestine.

a metaplasia of paneth cells in the large bowel was not found in the presence of severe acute gi gvhd as we observed paneth cells in 12 of 34 colon biopsies.

according to the physiological distribution of paneth cells in the gi tract we observed a significantly higher relative expression of paneth cell amps hd5 hd6 and reg3a in mucosal biopsies of the small intestine including duodenum jejunum and ileum compared to the large intestine comprising colon and rectum.amps are small cationic peptide antibiotics with bactericidal activity against pathogenic bacteria fungi and several viruses.
