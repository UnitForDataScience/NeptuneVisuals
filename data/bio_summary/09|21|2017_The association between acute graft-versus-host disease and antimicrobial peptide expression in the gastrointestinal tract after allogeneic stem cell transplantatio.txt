Interestingly we found also significantly higher Reg3a expression in the small intestine 3.3x101 5.1x10-4 to 2.6x102 than in the stomach 1.5x10-1 1.9x10-2 to 8.3x101 p  0.001 or large intestine 3.1x10-3 3.1x10-5 to 9.2x101 p0.001 .Levels of Paneth cell AMPs correlate with the severity of acute GI GvHDNext we investigated the impact of acute GI GvHD on the relative expression of Paneth cell AMPs in acute GI GvHD.

However not only Paneth cells are able to pro- duce AMPs also intestinal epithelial cells are able to secrete AMPs into the intestinal lumen in order to limit intestinal inflammation and to restore intestinal homeostasis  which might explain inflammatory induction in the large intestine during GvHD as found in our data.However in fact it cannot be ruled out that other factors e.g.

In acute GI GVHD the extent of Paneth cell destruction has been observed to correlate with severity of acute GvHD.

As indirect markers of intestinal microbiome diversity low levels of uri- nary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels were associated with severe stages of acute GI GvHD com- pared to mild stage or no acute GI GvHD p  0.05.

Accordingly mean Paneth cell count in the large intestine wasRelative expression of Paneth cell AMPs correlates with severity of acute GI GvHD.

Here in a retrospective analysis of 200 patients undergoing ASCT at the Regensburg Uni- versity Medical Center we assessed the relative expression of Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides AMPs Human Defensins HD 5 and 6 and regenerating islet-derived 3a Reg3a in 292 human intestinal biopsies as well as Reg3a serum levels in relation to acute GI GvHD.

In this retrospective study of patients undergoing ASCT we analyzed relative gene expres- sion of Paneth cell AMPs HD5 HD6 and Reg3a in 292 intestinal biopsies and determined serum levels of Reg3a in relation to acute GvHD of the GI tract.Patients material and methodsPatientsA total of 200 adult patients undergoing ASCT at the University Hospital Regensburg were included in our retrospective analysis.

Our analyses of Paneth cell AMPs in intestinal biopsies of patients with acute GI GvHD showed an opposing correlation of GvHD and relative AMP expression in the small intestine compared to the large intestine.

Due to the low number of stomach biopsies an analysis of GvHD changes in AMP secretion was not possible for this subgroup of patients.Severe acute GI GvHD and Paneth cell number correlate with loss of microbiome diversityAs indirect markers of intestinal microbiome diversity urinary 3-IS levels were measured within 14 days of biopsy harvesting.
