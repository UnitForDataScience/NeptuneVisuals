altogether these ndings suggested a relationship between these metabolites and cardiovascular risk factors.the associations between dietary choline and betaine onthe risk of cvd have been evaluated in several prospective studies.32-34 compared with the lowest quartile of intakeincident coronary heart disease after 14 years of follow-up in participants from the aric atherosclerosis risk in commu- nities study was nonsignificantly higher in the highest quartile of choline and choline plus betaine hrs 95 cis 1.22 0.91-1.64 and 1.14 0.85-1.53 respectively com- pared with the lowest quartile.32 in women from the jackson heart study greater choline intake was associated with lower left ventricular mass p0.0006 for trend across choline quartiles and with abdominal aortic calcium score.34 simi- larly higher dietary intakes of betaine and choline were not associated with cvd risk in postmenopausal dutch women followed up for 97 months.33 on the other hand findings from the nurses' health study and health professionals follow-up study including 80 978 women and 39 434 men respectively followed up to 32 years suggested that higher phosphatidylcholine intake was associated with an increased risk of cvd mortality after adjustment for potential confounders.35previous published literature on this topic has mostlyfocused on the formation of the gut microbiota-dependent metabolite tmao.246 one of the most compelling studies linking these metabolites with cvd complications was reported by wang and collaborators a few years ago.6 the authors identified a novel pathway linking dietary phos- phatidylcholinecholine which can be converted by the intestinal microbiota into trimethylamine and subsequently converted into tmao by hepatic flavin-containing mono- oxygenases with cvd pathogenesis.13 these findings are consistent with later in vivo and in vitro studies suggestingthat choline metabolites may increase the risk of atheroscle- rosis and coronary heart disease.4293637 in addition the ability of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics to temporarily suppress the production of tmao suggests that intestinal microorganisms may play an important role in the production of tmao from phosphatidylcholine in humans.4 nevertheless our data did not support positive significant associations between plasma concentrations of tmao and the risk of cvd in individuals at high cardiovascular risk after 4.8 years of follow-up.

although tmao was associated with cvd mortality in participants undergoing incident dialysis in a nested case-control study when they replicated the findings in an independent study no differences were found in tmao concentrations between cases of cardiovascular death and controls.7 one of the potential reasons for these associations is that elevated tmao levels are strongly related with renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease and they normalize after renal transplantation.38 therefore because kidney disease is a risk factor for cvd tmao was probably associated with cvd mortality because individuals undergoing dialysis have more risk of developing cvd.findings from a recent study including 817 participants ofthe cardia coronary artery risk development in young adults followed up for 10 years showed that tmao was not associated with coronary artery calcium incidence or other measures of cvd risk including insulin resistance inflamma- tory markers and lipid profile.

subgroup analysis for the associa- tion between the choline score and the risk of cvd is shown in table 3. we observed similar associations between the score and cvd after adjusting for baseline plasmatable 2. risk of cvd and stroke by baseline plasma concentrations of choline metabolites in the predimed studycontinuedinverse normal transformation was applied to raw values of metabolites.

therefore our findings suggest that metabolites from choline pathways may play a role in the development of cvd.plasma metabolites in the choline pathway which are derivatives from dietary sources and may also reflectalterations in the gut microbiota have been previously related to multifactorial diseases such as obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus and cvd.122 several mechanisms are probably involved including modulation of host energy metabolism gut epithelial permeability gut peptide hormone secretion and an increase in metabolic endotoxemia and inflammatory sta- tus.23-25 one of the mechanisms explaining the potential associations between some of these metabolites and cvd is the potential proatherogenic effects.6 it has been shown that tmao can inhibit reverse cholesterol transport alter sterol metabolism26 and affect platelet activation and thrombosis risk.27 however the associations between plasma metabo- lites within the choline pathway identified using novel high- throughput metabolomics techniques and the incidence of cvd at a population-based level have only recently been reported.to our knowledge this is the first case-cohort study in aclinical trial setting showing that higher concentrations of plasma choline and a-glycerophosphocholine are associated with an increased risk of cvd higher concentrations of choline and phosphocholine are associated with a higher risk of stroke.

for the overall score the hr per sd was 2.36 95 ci 1.39- 4.02 and for the betainecholine ratio the hr per sd was 0.82 95 ci 0.69-0.96.choline pathway metabolites and meddiet interventionsas illustrated in the figure we observed a higher risk of cvd events for those participants who had a higher choline score quartiles 2-4 and were assigned to the control group compared with those with lower levels in the score and assigned to the meddiet intervention groups hr 2.37 95 ci 1.34-4.18. participants with a higher betainecholine ratio and assigned to the meddiet intervention group had a lower risk of cvd compared with those with a lower ratio andin the control group hr 0.36 95 ci 0.21-0.63 figure.

we have evaluated the association between metabolites from the choline pathway and risk of incident cvd and the potential modifying effect of mediterranean diet interventions.methods and results---we designed a case-cohort study nested within the predimed prevention with mediterranean diet trial including 229 incident cvd cases and 751 randomly selected participants at baseline followed up for 4.8 years.

lately metabo- lites from the choline pathway have received increasing attention for its link with the gut microbiota and the potential mechanistic relevance of them.1 in particular these studies have focused on metabolites associated with betaine and choline metabolism and the gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine n-oxide tmao which have been associated with atherosclerosis development and cardiovas- cular disease cvd.12 choline can be oxidized to betaine in humans and the betainecholine ratio has been inversely associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease3 but itsassociation with cvd has not been previously described.dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine is the primary source of choline and catabolism of betaine and choline by intestinal microbes leads to tmao production.4 foods such as meat egg yolks and high-fat dairy products which are rich in phosphatidylcholine choline carnitine and tma serve as dietary precursors for tmao generation in mice and humans.2 dietary supplementation with these metabolites in mice promoted atherosclerosis and suppression of the microbiota with antibiotics prevented the effect of dietary choline in enhancing atherosclerosis.4 this evidence suggests that diet could modulate intestinal microbiota composition and sub- sequently the ability to synthesize trimethylamine and tmao thus providing a mechanistic link between diet gutmicrobiome and atherosclerosis.1256 however not all human studies have confirmed the association between tmao and cardiovascular events.7-10 indeed the relation between plasma concentration of choline pathway metabo- lites and the incidence of hard cvd end points in a population-based level and the role that diet may play in these associations remain to be elucidated.we hypothesized that higher concentrations at baseline and 1-year changes in choline pathway metabolites tmao betaine choline phosphocholine and a-glycerophosphocho- line would be associated with the risk of cardiovascular events.

higher concentrations of a choline metabolite score were associated with higher risk of cvd and stroke whereas the ratio of betainecholine was inversely associated with cvd but not with stroke alone.

the mediterranean diet meddiet which is high in plant-based foods has been linked with a reduced risk of cardiovascular risk factors and cvd.11 because previous evidence suggests that excessive consumption of phos- phatidylcholine and choline could be reduced by consuming a plant-based or high-fiber diet4 such as the meddiet we hypothesized that the associations between choline metabo- lites and cvd will be modified by meddiet interventions.

using a case-cohort study conducted in participants at high cardiovascular risk from the predimed prevention with mediterranean diet study we aimed to address the following1 whether baseline choline pathway metabolites and their1-year changes predict future risk of cvd and 2 whether these associations are mitigated by a meddiet intervention.methodsstudy populationwe designed a case-cohort study in the framework of the predimed study.

likewise partic- ipants with a higher score and in the control group also had a higher risk of stroke hr 2.66 95 ci 1.22-5.80 table s4.one-year changes in plasma concentrations of metabolites and cvdno significant associations were observed for quartiles of 1-year changes in plasma concentrations of individual metabolites and the risk of cvd and stroke.

the baseline choline metabolite score was associated with a 2.21-fold higher risk of cvd across extreme quartiles 95 confidence interval 1.36-3.59 p0.001 for trend and a 2.27-fold higher risk of stroke 95 confidence interval 1.24-4.16 p0.001 for trend.

similar but weakened associations were observed when stroke was used as the end point table 2. in the multivariable adjusted models the choline score was associated with a 2.21-fold higher risk of cvd and a 2.27-fold higher risk of stroke across quartiles hr 95 ci 2.21 1.36-3.59 p0.001 for trend and 2.27 1.24-4.16p0.001 for trend respectively.
