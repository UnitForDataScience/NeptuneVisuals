This disadvantage may be partially solved by combining bioinformatics and phylogenetic analy- sis of unique representative sequences along with validated reference sequences   .

These sequences represented the89.7  of the total fungal sequences retrieved in this study.

The ITS regions of the ribosomal rDNA are the most used DNA barcodes in fungalmetabarcoding since they can be easily amplified and se- quenced with universal primers and their sequences are high- ly represented in genetic databases  .

A major drawback of the ITS regions as barcode genes concern difficulties in discriminating phylogenetically related fungal species which may have al- most identical sequences but completely different ecology including pathogenicity.

Both primers were modified to construct fusion primers appropriate for 454 sequencing with adapter sequences A and B a key sequence and multiplex identifiers MIDs .

Furthermore mismatches in the primer sequence were not allowed and sequences 150 and 1000 bp contain- ing homopolymers 10 bp and with 6 ambiguous bases were discarded.

Reads were denoised using denoise wrap- per  and chimeric sequences were identified using USEARCH 6.1 algorithm  combining a reference- based with a de novo detection.

ITSx was used to extract ITS2 sequences .

When reads failed to hit to reference database sequences were clustered as de novo.

F urth ermo re so m e Bco re  OTUs were phylogenetically analysed along with related reference sequences to enable their identification with highest possible level of accuracy  .
