Finally a group of sequences clustering in a single OTU was associated to the genus Botrytis 0.51 -Table 1 Diversity indices of fungal communities associated to B. oleae0.17 .

This disadvantage may be partially solved by combining bioinformatics and phylogenetic analy- sis of unique representative sequences along with validated reference sequences   .

These sequences represented the89.7  of the total fungal sequences retrieved in this study.

A total of 4344 sequences 9.78 - 3.93  clustering in a single OTU were associated to Alternaria sect.

Another OTU ac- counting for the 0.36 - 0.16  of sequences was associated toP.

Moreover we retrieved sequences that were associated to A. pullulans Devriesia sp.

Indeed in our study the sequences associated to the genus Cladosporium were up to 42 times greater than that reported by Abdelfattah and co- workers.

Otherwise sequences associated to the genus Alternaria showed the same pattern resulting up to 49 times more abundant on the body of B. oleae than that in the olive phyllosphere.

Among putative plant pathogens we also retrieved sequences associated to Aspergillus spp.

The ITS regions of the ribosomal rDNA are the most used DNA barcodes in fungalmetabarcoding since they can be easily amplified and se- quenced with universal primers and their sequences are high- ly represented in genetic databases  .
