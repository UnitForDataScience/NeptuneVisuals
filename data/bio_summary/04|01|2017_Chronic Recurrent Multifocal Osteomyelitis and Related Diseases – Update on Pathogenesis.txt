Furthermore Nlrp3 may be playing a redundant role with caspase 8 in osteomyelitis in the cmo model because cmo mice that are deficient in Nlrp3 Ripk3 and caspase-8 cmo.Nlrp3--.Ripk3--.caspase8-- are also partially protected from disease 48.In addition to demonstrating that disease in the cmo mouse is an IL-1b mediated disease there is new data that the cmo microbiome is altered and that dietary changes can modulate the development of sterile osteomyelitis in this model.

Our group and others demonstrated that disease in the cmo mice is an IL-1 dependent disorder and that it is IL-1b not IL-1a mediated using double mutant mice 46 47.Despite being IL-1b dependent the disease in cmo mice can occur independent of a functional Nlrp3 inflammasome as cmo mice that are also deficient in either Nlrp3 ASC or caspase-1 continue to develop osteomyelitis 46 47.

described significantly higher expression of Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein ASC caspase-1 CASP-1 andIL-1b expression at the mRNA level in peripheral mononuclear blood cells from children with active disease than healthy children and those with inactive disease 11.

Experiments using the mouse model also demonstrated that the environment can significantly alter disease susceptibility as cmo mice develop an altered gut microbiome and marked disease protection when fed a high fat diet.

The role of the diet in pathogenesis needs to be explored in human CRMO as this is a potentially highly applicable discovery that could alter how we approach treatment.AcknowledgmentsPJF is supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases at the National Institutes of Health 2R01AR059703.ReferencesWipff J Costantino F Lemelle I Pajot C Duquesne A Lorrot M et al.
