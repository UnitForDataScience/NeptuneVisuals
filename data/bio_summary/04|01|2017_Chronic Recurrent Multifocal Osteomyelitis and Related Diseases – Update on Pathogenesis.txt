Furthermore Nlrp3 may be playing a redundant role with caspase 8 in osteomyelitis in the cmo model because cmo mice that are deficient in Nlrp3 Ripk3 and caspase-8 cmo.Nlrp3--.Ripk3--.caspase8-- are also partially protected from disease 48.In addition to demonstrating that disease in the cmo mouse is an IL-1b mediated disease there is new data that the cmo microbiome is altered and that dietary changes can modulate the development of sterile osteomyelitis in this model.

Our group and others demonstrated that disease in the cmo mice is an IL-1 dependent disorder and that it is IL-1b not IL-1a mediated using double mutant mice 46 47.Despite being IL-1b dependent the disease in cmo mice can occur independent of a functional Nlrp3 inflammasome as cmo mice that are also deficient in either Nlrp3 ASC or caspase-1 continue to develop osteomyelitis 46 47.

described significantly higher expression of Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein ASC caspase-1 CASP-1 andIL-1b expression at the mRNA level in peripheral mononuclear blood cells from children with active disease than healthy children and those with inactive disease 11.

Experiments using the mouse model also demonstrated that the environment can significantly alter disease susceptibility as cmo mice develop an altered gut microbiome and marked disease protection when fed a high fat diet.

Demonstrates the critical role of IL1 signaling in sterile osteomyelitis in the cmo mouse and implicated the neutrophil in disease pathogenesis.

This provides additional support for the use of IL-1b blockers in the treatment of Majeed syndrome.Murine chronic multifocal osteomyelitis cmo and the microbiomeThe cmo mouse develops sterile osteomyelitis due to recessive mutations in Pstpip2 which encodes proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein -2 Pstpip2 or PPIP2 25 26.

In addition there are both murine and canine models of the disease.

There is a strong association of CRMO with a personal or family history of inflammatory disorders of the skin intestinal track and the joints suggesting shared disease pathogenesis.

Psoriasis vulgaris palmar-plantar pustulosis Crohn disease and inflammatory arthritis are the most commonly co-morbidities but other associations have also been reported 2-8.

However the serum cytokines and chemokines described above have been proposed as biomarkers to monitor disease activity in CRMO and will need further validation through prospective studies.Treatments for CRMO remain empirical with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs as the first-line of treatment 15 16.
