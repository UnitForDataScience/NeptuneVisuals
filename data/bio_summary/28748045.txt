for both error rates the sigtree package converts the one-sided p-values to two-sided p-values applies the p-value correction and converts back to one-sided adjusted p-values so that directional interpretation is preserved.once the usually error-rate-adjusted branch-level p-values have been obtained the sigtree package assigns a color based on p-value range to each branch and tip in the phylogenetic tree to aid in visuali- zation.

as a result very small p-values close to 0 represent evidence that treatment induces greater abundance than does control while very large p-values close to 1 indicate less abundance in treatmentstouffer's method thus produces a single one-sided p-value for the entire branch essentially corresponding to a test of h0 the otus in the branch have no consensus of differential abundance vs. ha there is a consensus in a particular direction of differential abundance in the branch.

nb is the number of otus in subtree b same as number in subtree d and d is the magnitude of maximum possible response in subtrees a and c.while limited in scope to this one basic tree structure and treatment effect framework this simulation study as a proof of principle demon- strates the expected performance of sigtree - appropriate power in- crease as the magnitude of treatment response increases in subtrees exhibiting a consensus response and appropriate though possibly conservative control of the type i error rate.it should be noted that these simulations required nearly 6 days' worth of computation time reduced to less than 5 hours real time thanks to the batch computing resources of the center for high perfor- mance computing at the university of utah.example study resultsa visualizes the sigtree package results from the mouse gut microbiome example with the fwer across the entire phylogenetictree controlled at 0.05. see 's discussion of one-sided p-values regarding why the lower and upper thresholds of 0.025 and 0.975 are appropriate here when controlling the error rate at 0.05. hartung's method was used to obtain the branch-level p-values as the adonis test showed significant evidence p-value 0.0012 of distance- based dependence among the otu-level p-values.

a p-value close to 0 suggests branch consensus of greater abundance in treatment while a p-value close to 1 suggests branch consensus of less abundance in treatment.

rather than only considering the treatment effect on the relative abundance levels of in- dividual otus it is frequently of interest to identify and subsequently visualize branches of a phylogenetic tree whose member otus exhibit corresponding author at 3900 old main hill utah state university logan ut 84322-3900 usa.e-mail address j.r. stevens.a significant consensus abundance response to the treatment.

meta-analytic methods that employ results other than p-values such as effect size estimates could be applied but their application would require modification for each experiment while methods using only p-values allow for an approach fully generalizable to any experimental design as will be shown.in both the mouse and cheese examples interest lies in determining which otus and their member branches in the phylogenetic tree are specifically more abundant or less abundant in the treatment group t whole wheat diet or bif-6 presence than in the control group c refined wheat diet or bif-6 absence rather than just calling otus and member branches differentially abundant.

among meta-analytic p-value combination methods stouffer's method has been shown to have the most meaningful consensus biological interpretation  and also favorable statistical properties appropriate type i error rate control with higher power and better precision than competing methods .an implicit assumption of stouffer's method is the independence of p-values to be combined within a given set of tests such as a branch of the phylogenetic tree.

to make this visualization flexible sigtree can take user-defined colors and p-value thresholds and also export the phylogenetic tree in a nexus format file  with branch colors and p-values embedded via regular expressions since this format is simply a structured text file.

this could in turn induce more sulfur metabolic pathways and thus provide beneficial flavor changes to the cheese.discussionsigtree provides tools to use results of otu-level significance tests with meaningful one-sided p-values to identify and visualize branches in a phylogenetic tree that are significantly responsive to some treatment intervention or change in environmental conditions.

for each otu exhibiting a response to treatment as in subtrees a and c of  the magnitude of response was randomly chosen as a uniform value between 0.1 and d and otu abundance in the treatment condition was simulated as a normal variate with that magnitude mean and variance 1. the value d varied in ten steps from 0.1 to 2 and the number of otus in subtree b nb same as the number of otus in subtree d varied also in ten steps from 2 to 100. at each of the 100 combinations of d and nb values over 500 trees with corresponding subject-level data were simulated and a t-test was used to obtain a raw one-sided p-value for each otu in each simulation.

sigtree and its tuto- rial vignette will be maintained and updated by the corresponding author as future needs evolve.sigtree can help microbial community researchers efficiently make and effectively communicate in visual form novel discoveries re- garding how the abundance levels of entire families of otus or branches in the phylogenetic tree are affected by treatment interventions or other environmental changes.appendix a. supplementary datasupplementary data to this article can be found online at doi.org10.1016j.csbj.2017.06.002.referencesrambaut a. figtree.

even after controlling the family-wise error rate across all branches in the entire phylogenetic tree there is statistically signifi- cant evidence that the presence of bif-6 results in a consensus increased abundance of this family or phylogenetic branch of bacteria.

this is equivalent to performing a two-tailed test and when the p-value is less than0.05 concluding m n m  when y ny  and m b m  when y b y .method's p-value is the upper-tail area from zh in the standard nor- mal distribution .while hartung's method assumes a constant correlation among all pairs of p-values its results have been shown to be stable even in the presence of a non-constant correlation  which would be the case in the event of a significant adonis test.
