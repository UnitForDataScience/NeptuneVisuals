Foals develop a rich and diverse bacterial microbiota early in life and it has been previ- ously reported that the foal's fecal bacterial microbiota resembles that of adult horses by 60 days of age.

Loss of bacterial diversity and richness has been demonstrated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal enteropathies in humans and animals including wide-ranging disorders such as Crohn's dis- ease inflammatory bowel disease and acute enteric infections  in humans acute diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease  in dogs and acute colitis in adult horses The complexity of the fecal bacterial microbiota and the finding that bacterial alpha diversity is decreased in foals with diarrhea raises questions about common approaches to prevention or treatment of diarrhea.

Marked dif- ferences in composition of the fecal bacterial microbiota over all taxonomic levels and decreases in bacterial diver- sity evenness and richness have been described  .

A culture-based study showed that changes in the fecal bacterial microbiota over time did not differ between foals with diarrhea and healthy foals  however culture-based methods have limited ability to appreciate the complexity of the bacterial micro- biota .The objectives of this study were to describe differ- ences between foals with and without diarrhea at two and four weeks of life.MethodsThe University of Guelph Animal Care Committee AUP 1455 approved this study.Animals and study protocolFoals born on one Standardbred and seven Thorough- bred farms in southern Ontario Canada were studied.

Initial culture-based studies tended to focus on a narrow spectrum of the fecal bacterial micro- biota such as lactobacilli enterococci and clostridia Subsequent culture-independent studies have pro- vided much more insight into the rapid development of the bacterial microbiota.

Regardless there were many significant differences in the fecal bacterial microbiota even over this relatively short timeframe highlighting the dynamic nature of the microbiota.

Similar to the only comparable study of the fecal bacterial microbiota of foals the most abundant bacterial phyla here were Firmicutes Verrucomicrobiaand Proteobacteria The most abundant families were members of the Clostridia class Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae which is also in agreement with a prior study The field nature of the study and farm management factors made it impossible to collect fecal samples on specified days in this study.

Nevertheless further data was added to the growing knowledge on the development of the bac- terial microbiota and the age factor has to be considered when designing and interpreting microbial studies.In a study in adult horses with colitis changes on all taxonomic levels were identified Changes in mem- bers of higher taxonomic levels such as phylum order and class presumably indicate a more profound change of the bacterial microbiota and are more likely to result in functional differences compared to changes in lower taxonomic levels.
