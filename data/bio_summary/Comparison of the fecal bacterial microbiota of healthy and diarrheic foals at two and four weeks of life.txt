loss of bacterial diversity and richness has been demonstrated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal enteropathies in humans and animals including wide-ranging disorders such as crohn's dis- ease inflammatory bowel disease and acute enteric infections  in humans acute diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease  in dogs and acute colitis in adult horses the complexity of the fecal bacterial microbiota and the finding that bacterial alpha diversity is decreased in foals with diarrhea raises questions about common approaches to prevention or treatment of diarrhea.

a culture-based study showed that changes in the fecal bacterial microbiota over time did not differ between foals with diarrhea and healthy foals  however culture-based methods have limited ability to appreciate the complexity of the bacterial micro- biota .the objectives of this study were to describe differ- ences between foals with and without diarrhea at two and four weeks of life.methodsthe university of guelph animal care committee aup 1455 approved this study.animals and study protocolfoals born on one standardbred and seven thorough- bred farms in southern ontario canada were studied.

despite the high prevalence of foal diarrhea there is cur- rently little knowledge about the fecal bacterial microbiota of foals affected by diarrhea.

this raises questions about the potential efficacy of conventional probiotic organisms for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea especially when they have to compete in such as rich and abundant existing bacterial microbiota.antimicrobial treated foals were excluded as it has been shown that antimicrobial administration causes profound and sustained changes in the equine fecal bac- terial microbiota foals were included in the study irrespective of the cause of diarrhea.

storage conditions should not have significantly affected the results of our study particularly in regards to richness and diversity on the species level.conclusionsbacterial richness is decreased in foals with diarrhea suggesting that potential preventative and therapeutic measures should focus on providing and maintaining a diverse and rich bacterial microbiota in addition to de- fining and modifying the key bacterial species involved in gastrointestinal health such as members of the lach- nospiraceae and ruminococcaceae.endnotes1bio-sponge platinum peformance buellton ca.2e.z.n.a.

foals develop a rich and diverse bacterial microbiota early in life and it has been previ- ously reported that the foal's fecal bacterial microbiota resembles that of adult horses by 60 days of age.

acute diarrhea is associated with significant changes in the fecal bacterial microbiota of adult horses.

and a statistical difference in community structure was not consistent across statistical tests table .discussionthe bacterial microbiota of foals is assumed to play an important role in diarrhea and early colonization anddevelopment is a dynamic process.

in this study signifi- cant impacts of both age and diarrhea were noted with the most evident influential factor being age.knowledge of the bacterial microbiota in foals is still in its infancy.

however some differ- ences in fecal bacterial microbiota composition and structure were evident.an apparent underrepresentation of lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae the two most abundant families were seen in foals with diarrhea in this study.

given the small number of foals and large variation in diarrhea duration this was no feasible.factors other than age can impact the fecal bacterial microbiota and could not be accounted for.
