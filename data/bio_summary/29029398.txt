In addition the relative MT mRNA expression by5.4 or 270.4 fold was increased after supplementing Nano- ZnO and traditional ZnO and interestingly the relative mRNA expression of MT in the traditional ZnO group was dramatically higher than that in other two groups P  0.05 Figure 1B-1C.Dietary Nano-ZnO improved the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the jejunal and ileal tissuesCompared with the control the relative mRNA expression of CDK4 was elevated but the relative mRNA expression of Caspase3 was reduced by Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO significantly P  0.01.

The mRNA expression of IGF-1 was increased by traditional ZnO compared with the control group P  0.05 but no significant differences were found in mRNA expression of IGF-1 between traditional ZnO and Nano- ZnO treatments P  0.05 Figure 1D.Dietary supplementation with Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO significantly decreased the relative mRNA expression of IFN-g IL-1b TNF-a and NF-kB in comparison to control animals P  0.01.

Therefore both Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO in this study can enrich the bacterial richness and diversity which may be beneficial to the construction of a more stable intestinal micro-ecosystem 32.In cecum the bacterial richness was decreased by treating with Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO while the bacterial diversity was only reduced in traditional ZnO group which was in agreement with a previous study 22.

Incidence of diarrhea was alleviated by the addition of Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO when compared with the control group P  0.01 while piglets in Nano-ZnO treatment had higher diarrhea incidence than piglets in traditional ZnO group P  0.05.

The mRNA expression of IFN-g TNF-a and NF-kB did not differ between Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO treatments P 0.05 while as to IL-1b Nano-ZnO was significantly higher than the traditional ZnO treatment P  0.01.

Control corn-soybean meal basal diet Cu-Zn SOD Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase GPX1 glutathione peroxidase 1 MT metallothionein IGF-1 insulin-like growth factor 1 Nano-ZnO corn- soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 600 mg Znkg as nano zinc oxide ZnO corn-soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 2000 mg Znkg from zinc oxide.and traditional ZnO P  0.01 Figure 2B2-2C2 and the OTUs and Chao 1 value showed no significant difference between Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO treatments P 0.05.

No significant differences in feed conversion efficiency between Nano-ZnO group and traditional ZnO group were found which indicated that Nano-ZnO with a dose of 600 mg Znkg might have a similar effect to traditional ZnO in the concentration of 2000 mg Znkg on improving feed efficiency in weaning piglets during post-weaning d 0-14.

Incidence of diarrhea was reduced by treating with Nano-ZnO and traditional ZnO while piglets fed Nano-ZnO had a higher diarrhea incidence than piglets fed with traditional ZnO in this study.

On day 14 after weaning the piglets fed Nano-ZnO did not differ from those fed traditional ZnO in growth performance and jejunal morphology while Nano-ZnO treatment could significantly alleviate the incidence of diarrhea P 0.05.
