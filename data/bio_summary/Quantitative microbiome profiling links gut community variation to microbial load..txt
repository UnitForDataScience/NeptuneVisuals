2 By rarefying to an even number of reads per sample RMP assumes similar genus abundance distributions in samples A and B sample A is therefore sequenced far more intensively than sample B.

a Microbial cell counts and moisture content were negatively correlated in the longitudinal and the validation cohort though not in the study cohort study cohort n  37 Spearman's r  -0.12 two-sided FDR  0.56 longitudinal cohort n  132Spearman's r  -0.52 two-sided FDR  1.6 x 10-9 validation cohortn  54 Spearman's r  -0.56 two-sided FDR  9.1 x 10-5. b Microbial cell counts and observed richness correlated mildly study cohort n  40 Spearman's r  0.36 two-sided P  2.3 x 10-2.Extended Data Figure 4  Faecal microbial loads vary across enterotypes.

Taxa were pre-filtered to exclude taxa unclassified at the genus level and taxa that were present in less than 50 of the samples.Benchmarking the QMP and RMP approach for co-abundance network reconstruction using simulated RMP and QMP data.

Next simulated real data matrices were rarefied to 80 of the lowest sample total count to obtain simulated RMP matrices using the R package phyloseq.

Using a quantitative approach we identified that this key microbiome signal is driven by an overall reduction in microbiota cell counts rather than by the blooming of disease-asso- ciated taxa with the effect size of Crohn's disease on observed species richness being estimated at 51.5 using QMP Wilcoxon rank-sum test P  1.2 x 10-7 compared to 32.3 using RMP P  1.4 x 10-3 .By integrating microbial cell counting into a sequencing workflowwe demonstrated that microbial loads differ significantly between individuals and that they are associated with specific types of faecalQMP should permit us to assess key microbiome findings founded on relative profiling in a quantitative context.

The whiskers extend from the quartiles to the last simulated data point within 1.5x interquartile range.Extended Data Figure 9  RMP underestimates the decrease in microbiome richness associated with Crohn's disease.

Among these dis- crepancies we highlight the fact that Bacteroides abundances are asso- ciated with Crohn' disease only when applying RMP whereas Prevotella abundances are found to be decreased in patients with Crohn's disease only when using QMP .
