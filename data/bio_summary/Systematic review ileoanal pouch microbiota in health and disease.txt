it is yet not fully understood the influence these have on disease course table 8. interestingly tannock et al43 found that antibiotic administration either ciprofloxacin ceftin cefuroxime or metronidazole did not reduce the total number of bacteria in faecal ileoanal pouchtabl e 8 microbiota changes following treatment of pouchitis with antibioticssamples.43 in contrast kuhbacher et al48 found that antibiotic use in pouchitis was associated with a lower bacterial richness and diversity in biopsies from patients who achieved remission.48 fur- thermore biopsies from pouchitis patients have shown that antibi- otics reduce specific bacterial groups including bacteroides firmicutes and tenericutes.42 faecal samples from pouchitis patients have shown reductions in faecalibacterium spp.

and lachnospiraceae36 biopsies from pouchitis patients have shown increases in enterococcaceae and pasteurel- laceae.42when comparing faecal samples from pouchitis patients who were using antibiotics with those not doing so it was found that those not taking antibiotics had fewer firmicutes and higher num- bers of proteobacteria.43 in faecal samples from patients taking maintenance antibiotics for chronic pouchitis caulobacteriaceae sphingomonadaceae comamonadaceae peptostreptococcaceae were significantly reduced.43with regard to the microbial impact of specific antibiotics it has been shown that treatment with metronidazole resulted in complete eradication of anaerobic bacteria including c. perfringens.32 when pou- chitis patients were treated with ciprofloxacin c. perfringens and all coliforms including haemolytic strains of e. coli disappeared.32 both ciprofloxacin and metronidazole are the first line treatments for pou- chitis49 and result in clinical remission in about 60 of patients.49 as both c. perfringens and e. coli have been associated with pouchitis3233 this gives further credence to the concept that manipulating the gut microbiota to alter specific bacteria may help prevent this disease.3.8.1  summaryantibiotic treatment for pouchitis is associated with an overall reduc- tion in bacterial richness within the ileoanal pouch.
