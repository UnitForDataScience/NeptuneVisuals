The middle panels represent deviation of microbiota of patients with different C4 genotype groups from microbiota of controls with unknown C4 genotypes 1 5 identical to microbiota of healthy subjects n 5 26 18.

The C4A gene number was not associated with calprotectin levels P 5 06.Microbial diversity in the faecal samples trend P 5 0008 the similarity to control microbiota index trend P 5 0006 and the relative abundance of butyrate- producing bacteria trend P 5 0024 were correlated sig- nificantly negatively with C4B gene number in patients Fig.

The correlations were not confounded by current inflammation or anti-TNF-a treatment after controlling for calprotectin level and the use of anti-TNF-a medication diversity and similarity to control microbiota remained associated sig- nificantly with the C4B gene number P 5 0007 P 5 003 respectively and borderline significant with the total C4 gene number P 5 006 and P 5 006 respectively.At the level of individual genus-level groups the C4B gene number was correlated significantly false discovery rate FDR-corrected P-value  005 negatively with several butyrate producers relatives of Eubacterium LachnospiraTable 1.

The total C4 gene num- ber C4A 1 C4B was correlated negatively with both microbial diversity and similarity to control microbiota trends P 5 003 and P 5 001 respectively but not sig- nificantly with butyrate producers trend P 5 009.

The microbiota composi- tion and similarity to control microbiota average correla- tion between the patient microbiota profile and that in controls in the patients were analysed previously 18.

The observation of a 'normal-appearing' microbiota in C4B-deficient IBD patients suggests that the disease aetiol- ogy is related to aberrant host responses to normal micro- biota driving the microbiota into a dysbiotic inflammation-tolerant state rather than the other way around.

In contrast the C4A gene number was not associ- ated with either microbial diversity trend P 5 051 butyrate producers trend P 5 0042 or similarity to con- trol microbiota trend P 5 061.
