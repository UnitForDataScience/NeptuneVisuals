the middle panels represent deviation of microbiota of patients with different c4 genotype groups from microbiota of controls with unknown c4 genotypes 1 5 identical to microbiota of healthy subjects n 5 26 18. the lower panels show the abundance of butyrate producers in the c4 genotype patient group.between the c4 deficiency group  4 c4ab and the nor- mal c4 copy number group 2 4 copies of c4ab fig.

2. in contrast the c4a gene number was not associ- ated with either microbial diversity trend p 5 051 butyrate producers trend p 5 0042 or similarity to con- trol microbiota trend p 5 061. the total c4 gene num- ber c4a 1 c4b was correlated negatively with both microbial diversity and similarity to control microbiota trends p 5 003 and p 5 001 respectively but not sig- nificantly with butyrate producers trend p 5 009. the correlations were not confounded by current inflammation or anti-tnf-a treatment after controlling for calprotectin level and the use of anti-tnf-a medication diversity and similarity to control microbiota remained associated sig- nificantly with the c4b gene number p 5 0007 p 5 003 respectively and borderline significant with the total c4 gene number p 5 006 and p 5 006 respectively.at the level of individual genus-level groups the c4b gene number was correlated significantly false discovery rate fdr-corrected p-value  005 negatively with several butyrate producers relatives of eubacterium lachnospiratable 1. basic characteristic of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease pibd patients of the two study populations the microbiota study and the complement studyageat diagnosis of ibd113 3-161112 2-156at the time of analysis144 97-183167 113-194 diagnosescrohn's disease30 63819 731ileocolonic19 4048 308colonic2 434 154ileal6 1286 231perianal only1 211 38ulcerative colitis14 2984 154extensive colitis7 1494 154left-sided7 1490 0unclassified ibd3 643 115disease duration years35 0-9939 03-174anti-tnf-a medication no.

dna was extracted from the stool samples using the repeated bead beating method 30. we have previously calculated the similarity to the control microbiota index for these patients which characterizes how similar the microbiota composition is to the composi- tion in non-pibd individuals 18. briefly the index was an average of the correlations between the microbiota of a patient and with subjects n 5 26 with healthy intestine determined by low calprotectin levels 18. composition of the intestinal microbiota was analysed with a phylogenetic microarray the hitchip 31 consisting of oligonucleo- tide probes the intensities of which were summarized using the robust probabilistic averaging rpa for probe- level analysis method 32 as 1038 species-level bacterial phylotypes.

the diseases are multi-factorial and are associated with genetic predis- position environmental factors changes in the intestinal microbiota and their interactions with the surroundings 1. genomewide association studies have identified com- mon variants in more than 160 genes that contribute to the genetic susceptibility to ibd 2. many of the contributing genes code for proteins involved in innate immune responses which are initiated by the complement system 34. disease aetiology is therefore thought to involve perturbed host-microbiota interactions due either toabnormal reactions to the normal microbiota or aberrant microbiota development eliciting inflammatory host responses 5.the complement system has a critical role in maintain- ing the tissue homeostasis by eliminating excess bacteria and cellular debris.

the microbiota composi- tion and similarity to control microbiota average correla- tion between the patient microbiota profile and that in controls in the patients were analysed previously 18. microbial diversity was calculated as the inverse simpson diversity index.

linear models were used to analyse the association between the number of c4 genes and the microbiota diversity and similarity to control microbiota.

con- versely deficiencies of c4 particularly of c4a may be dele- terious in other cases such as in systemic lupus erythematosus patients 41. c4 deficiencies may even pro- mote the onset of ibd 15 by compromising the host's ability to control the microbiota.

the observed association between genotype host response and microbiota composi- tion is in line with the paradigm of microbiota-dependent genetically determined inflammation in ibd 17. pheno- typical c4 deficiencies can be the result of increased protein consumption or genetic deficiencies caused by deletions conversions or silencing mutations 21. c4 deficiency can lead to insufficient complement activation and impaired removal of not only microbes but also of other unwanted material including apoptotic cells and extracellular debris from the body.

the levels were associated significantly positively with the number of c4b genes trend p 5 00002 and with the total number of c4 genes p  00001 indicating that the c4 genotype and subse- quently higher amounts of c4 were associated with intesti- nal inflammation fig.

we also found that pibd patients deficient in c4b fewer than two c4b genes recovered poorly after surgery 15.studies of intestinal microbiota with ibd patients have shown a decreased bacterial diversity and changes in microbiota composition in the faecal samples and colonic biopsies compared to healthy controls 16-18. reduced levels of butyrate producers and akkermansia muciniphila have been detected in patients with ibd mainly ulcerative colitis 1920. a. muciniphila is a bacterium specialized to mucin degradation and a key organism at the mucosal interface between the lumen and host cells 21. both butyrate producers and a. muciniphila are considered important for healthy gut barrier function and have anti- inflammatory effects.

a calprotectin result of  100 lgg in stools was considered normal whereas results of 1000 lgg were considered to be exceedingly high 25-29.ethics statementthe study on inflammatory markers in paediatric-onset ibd was approved by the ethics committee of the helsinki university central hospital 371e72004 25th amend- ment january 2012. the patients or their guardians signed an informed consent form to participate in this study at the diagnosis or at the start of therapy with gluco- corticoids or infliximab.microbiota analysis the microbiota studythe patients' microbiota has been described previously 18. briefly patients n 5 47 were requested to provide two stool samples for the measurement of faecal calprotec- tin and for microarray analysis.

as many as 615 of patients in the complement study and 231 p 5 0001 fisher's exact test in the microbiota study needed anti-tnf-a medica- tion and 231 in the complement study and 43 p 5 0.021 in the microbiota study underwent surgery for ibd.

the distribution of c4a and c4b gene numbers in the patients of the study groups are presented in table 2.c4b gene number is associated with microbiota composition and diversitycalprotectin levels in stools were measured from the study subjects in the microbiota study.

c4a is thought to be more important in immune clearance 46 while c4b is used more specifically in defence against microbes 40. the biochemical background for this is the stronger reac- tivity of c4a towards amino groups in proteins and of c4b towards hydroxyl groups prevalent for example in carbo- hydrates such as microbial capsules and lipopolysaccha- rides 47. reduced complement attack against bacteria as seen in c4b-deficient patients appears to dampen the inflammatory response of the host towards the microbiota and to allow a wider diversity of microbiota composition.
