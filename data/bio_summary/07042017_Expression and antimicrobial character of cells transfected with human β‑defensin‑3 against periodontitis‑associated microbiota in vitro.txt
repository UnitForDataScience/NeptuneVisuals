The objectives of the present study were to transfect human periodontal ligament cells HPDLCs and human bone marrow stromal cells HBMSCs with lentivirus containing the HBD-3 gene determine the transfection efficiency and investi- gate the antimicrobial activity of the experimental cells against periodontal pathogens.

Human periodontal ligament cells HPDLCs and human bone marrow stromal cells HBMSCs are useful seeding cells for periodontal cell therapies 1011.

The cells were incubated in 5 CO2 at 37C for an additional 72 h. The transfection efficiency was calcu- lated using a fluorescence microscope.Western blot analysis.

Transfection was performed by adding polybrene 8 ugml and 20 ul each viral dilution to the cells thoroughly and gently mixing the solutions and incubating the cells in 5 CO2 at 37C.

HPDLCs human periodontal ligament cells GFP green fluorescent protein HMBSCs human bone marrow stromal cells HBD-3 human b-defensin-3.USA was used for all statistical analyses.

The effect of the HBD-3 gene on the antimi- crobial activity of the cells were demonstrated by antimicrobial tests.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37C in a humidi- fied atmosphere of 95 air and 5 CO2.

The cells were passaged with 0.25 trypsin and 0.1 EDTA upon reaching confluence.

The lentiviral vector containing HBD-3 was first transfected into 293T packaging cells to obtain high levels of lentiviral particles in the culture supernatant.
