Differential expression analysis for sequence count data identified specific genera associated with GIT symptoms as assessed by the GIT2.0 questionnaire.Results The UCLA-SSc and OUH-SSc cohorts were similar in age 52.1 and 60.5 years respectively disease duration median IQR 6.6 2.5-16.4 and 7.0 1.0-19.2 years respectively gender distribution 88 and 71 respectively and GIT symptoms mean SD total GIT 2.0 scores of 0.7 0.6 and 0.6 0.5 respectively.

The exact details of this approach have been outlined in our prior publication and are summarised in the online Faecal calprotectinFaecal calprotectin concentrations were measured in duplicate from the stool specimens of the UCLA-SSc and healthy control participants using a commercial kit KTR-849 Epitope Diagnostics San Diego California USA according to the manufacturer's instructions.Assessment of GIT symptomsOn the day of their stool collection the UCLA and OUH-SSc participants completed the GIT 2.0 a valid measure of GIT symptom severity in patients with SSc.

The fre- quency of distribution of patients in each disease severity category were fairly well balanced N for low vs high groups total score 18 vs 16 constipation 16 vs 18distentionbloating 8 vs 26 and diarrhoea 18 vs 15.In both SSc cohorts Clostridium was more abundant in patients with low GIT symptom severity for the total GIT score and the bloatingdistension domain compared with patients with high GIT symptom severity  and see online S1.

In contrast Prevotella was more abundant in patients with moderate-to-severe GIT symptom severity bloatingdistention domain diarrhoea domain compared with patients with none-to-mild GIT symptom severity.DISCUSSIONConsistent with our prior findingsthe present study demonstrated that the SSc disease state is associated with alterations in the GIT microbial consortium.

This study did not assess GIT transit as there is no valid measure of GIT transit in SSc however diarrhoea and con- stipation are intrinsically related to GIT transit.

Patients with SSc had significantly lower levels of commensal genera deemed to protect against inflammation such as Bacteroides UCLA and OUH Faecalibacterium UCLA Clostridium OUH and significantly higher levels of pathobiont genera such as Fusobacterium UCLA compared with controls.Increased abundance of Clostridium was associated with less severe GIT symptoms in both cohorts.Conclusions The present analysis detected specific aberrations in the lower GIT microbiota of patients with SSc from 2 geographically and ethnically distinct cohorts.

These findings suggest that GIT dysbiosis may be a pathological feature of the SSc disease state.INTRODUCTIONThe majority of patients with systemic scler- osis SSc experience gastrointestinal tract GIT dysfunction.

Our prior study demonstrated that patients with SSc had decreased abundance of beneficial human commensal genera known to produce key energy metabolites and anti- inflammatory molecules for mucosal health eg Faecalibacterium Clostridium with a concurrent increase in potential pathobiont genera eg invasive g Proteobacteria Fusobacterium compared with controls.This study also demonstrated that increased abun- dance of Clostridium and decreased abundance of Fusobacterium were independently associated with decreased GIT symptoms.To further explore whether alterations in microbial composition may serve as a pathogenic factor in SSc-GIT dysfunction the present study examined the lower GIT microbiota from two independent SSc cohorts.

Whereas our prior study examined colonic mucosal microbes via colonoscopy the present study examined stool specimens from the same patients with SSc.Assessment of stool specimens may reflect other aspects of the gut microbiota eg metabolic features and can be obtained by a less inva- sive approach.The objectives of this study not previously explored in the SSc literature were to 1 establish whether analysis of stool specimens can distinguish the GIT microbiota of patients with SSc versus healthy controls 2 compare the GIT microbiota of patients with SSc from two geo- graphically independent cohorts and 3 evaluate the hypothesis that specific microbial genera are associated with SSc-GIT symptom severity.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy participantsPatient participants were consecutively enrolled from the outpatient rheumatology clinics at University of California Los Angeles UCLA and Oslo University Hospital OUH.

scores on the GIT 2.0 can indicate self-rated severity ie nonemild vs moderate vs severe very severe disease of GIT involvement based on previ- ously published score thresholds.Statistical and bioinformatics analysesStatistical approachAnalyses were performed using R V.3.1.2.
