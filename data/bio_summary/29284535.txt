The ecological correspondence is as follows BF group  Xanthomonadaceae BFI group Enterobacteriaceae Enterococcaceae Bacteroidaceae Co xiellaceae Flameovirgaceae Deferribacteraceae Glyco- mycetaceae and co-localized UF and GR groups  Stre ptococcaceae Bacillaceae Thermotogaceae Actinomyce- taceae Planococcaceae Neisseriaceae Veillonellaceae Pseudomonadaceae Burkholderiaceae Aeromonadaceae Staphylococcaceae Corynebacteriaceae Erysipelotricha- ceae Sinobacteraceae Lactobacillaceae Mycoplasmata- ceae Spirochaetaceae Geobacteraceae Halomonada ceae Rikenellaceae Propionibacteriaceae Alicyclobacil- laceae Desulfovibrionaceae Brevibacteriaceae Chroma- tiaceae Rhodocyclaceae Moraxellaceae Porphyro monadaceae Prevotellaceae Xanthomonadaceae Strep- tomycetaceae Actinosynnemataceae ComamonadaceaeCytophagaceae Flavobacteriaceae Sphingobacteriaceaeand Sporolactobacillaceae.DiscussionMost studies evaluating the microbiota of phlebotomines have used classical microbiological techniques such as bacterial culture and isolation which are limited in their ability to broadly profile the insect's microbiota since most bacteria have not been cultured to this date Our study analyzed the microbiota composition of wild- caught Lu.

First a clear resemblance between the bacterial abundance pro- files of the sand flies from the GR and UF groups sepa- rated them from the two blood-fed groups the BF and BFI groups.

When considering the predicted g-OTUs for each of the experimental conditions the UF group harbored the highest number of OTUs with 57 genera and 14 exclusive Zymobacter Aquabacterium Empedobacter Myroide Petrimonas Sphingobacterium Niabella Candidatus Cloacimonas Sporolactobacillus Lactobacillus Streptomyces Lentzea Candidatus Lum- bricincola and Edwardsiella followed by the GR group with 46 genera and 3 exclusive Acidovorax Plesiomonas and Sphaerotilus BFI the infected group with 22 genera 3 exclusive Rickettsiella Mucispirillum and Candidatus Cardinium and finally the BF group with 6 genera and none exclusive.

Along the CCA1 axis the UF and GR groups co-localize and separate from both blood-fed groups BF and BFI groups.

Enterobacteriaceae was the most abundant family in the BF and BFI groups and repre- sented 236442 and 393927 HQ reads of each group 60.83 and 95.60 respectively.After the blood meal bacterial abundance in terms of the raw reads increased when compared to the UF and GR groups.

In the BFI group the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae increased drastically when compared with the rest of the groups Additional file Table S1.Multivariate analyses exploring the underlying bacterial profilesInitially exploratory unconstrained methods were applied to explore how the bacterial abundance profilesat the family taxonomic rank may act as a signature capable of discriminating among the experimental groups under distinct physiological conditions and based on the influence of the inner ecosystem in which they develop.

In addition 30 sand flies from UF BF and BFI groups were dissected under a stereoscope in a biosafety cabinet andseparated into groups according to their physiological condition at the 3rd day after the blood feeding and stored in micro centrifuge tubes at -20 degC for DNA extraction.

longipalpis  P. argentipes P. duboscqi P. papatasi P. perfiliewi and P. sergenti  This is the first account of Enhydrobacter and Chryseobacterium in sand flies genera belonging to the Moraxellaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families re- spectively whose presence in sand flies was reported re- cently Both genera were more abundant in the UF and GR groups than in BF and BFI groups.By exploring the beta diversity both by a ranking method NMDS and a constraining method CCA we observed that the community composition within the sand fly holobiont is modulated by the type of meal the presence or absence of Leishmania parasites and vitello- genesis.

However our BFI group also showed a decrease on the microbiota composition when compared with the UF and GR groups.

This group was separated according their developing ovaries and verified to confirm the physiological condition and they were stored at -20 degC for downstream DNA extraction.DNA extractionBefore the DNA extraction process each pooled sample consisted of 30 sand flies from each experimental group and was surface sterilized by rinsing with distilled sterile water and then submerged for 1 min in 1 hypochlorite washed three times with PBS  and dissected in a bio- safety cabinet as described above.
