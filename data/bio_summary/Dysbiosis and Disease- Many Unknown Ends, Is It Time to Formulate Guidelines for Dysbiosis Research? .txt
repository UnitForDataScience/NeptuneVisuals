it is currently unknown whether such changes in the immune system accelerate the rate of dysbiosis.what are the changes in the bmdms quantitative and qualitative after dysbiosis in different scenarios and diseases what are their effective levels to have a significant functional alteration what are the systemic and organ specific influencesis gut microbiota profiling enough to know the extent of dysbiosis and qualitative and quantitative changes in the bmdmswhat needs to be done to create a uniform gut microbiota among the research animals irrespective of their sourcestrainhousing conditions to avoid confounding influence of microbiota changes and results can be reproduced in different labs.diabetes and obesity are bound to alter food ingestion pattern digestion efficiency water intake energy metabolism and gut peristalsis.

these scenarios prompted us to come with a set of tasks to be done to effectively direct the future research in the dysbiosis and to provide microbially uniform animals for research with a multi-disciplinary collaborative effort from industry and academia to save research dollars.

however research community needs guidelines on animal models and dysbiosis research to tackle the complexities associated with it.

there is a necessity for multi-disciplinary collaborative approach in setting up certain guidelines to hasten the dysbiosis research in a hassle- free manner.j.

the reason being high cost and many unknown loosely knit ends in the dysbiosis research.
