A The forward literature fungal primers ITS1 L ITS1-F L and ITS5 L had significantly lower overall taxonomic coverage than the B newly created forward primers ITS1-27F N ITS1-30F N ITS1-34F N and ITS1-48F N. The custom-designed reverse primer ITS1-217R N and the published reverse primer ITS2 L both demonstrated high predicted taxonomic coverage across the phyla.addition to an increase in sequencing depth there was a more consistent read recovery between the newly designed primer set designated by N than with the literature set.

Read recovery analysis for the selected primer pairs demon- strated that the custom-designed primer sets resulted in an order of magnitude increase over all but one published primer pair from the literature designated by L there was a 3-fold increase over the ITS5 L primer .

The newly developed ITS1 primer sets significantly improve general taxonomic coverage of fungal communities infecting humans and increased read depth by an order of magnitude over the best-performing published primer set tested.

The four custom-designed forward primer pairs were also tested with one published reverse primer .

The worst-performing primer was the published forward primer ITS1-F L which resulted in identification of 10 out of 13 cultures while primers ITS1 L and ITS5L both correctly identified 11 of the 13 cultures.

The DNA from the fungal culture samples underwent PCR using three published primer pairs and eight primer pairs consisting of custom-designed plus published primers .

The overall best-performing primer pair in terms of taxonomic coverage and read recovery ITS1-30FITS1-217R will aid in advancing research in the area of the human mycobiome.IMPORTANCE The mycobiome constitutes all the fungal organisms within an envi- ronment or biological niche.

The average in silico taxonomic coverage estimates obtained with PrimerProspector for the selected forward primers from the literature designated L and newly designed forward primers designated N. The published ITS1 L primer was recommended by UNITE and is therefore shown in this figure despite the low coverage performance.

Three forward primers and one reverse primer representing the previously published primers and four forward primers and one reverse primer representing the custom primers wereFIG 1 ITS rRNA gene locus.

Additionally the study presents a full 18S-ITS-5.8S contig database SIS that can be used to evaluate the priming efficacy of the ITS region and offers suggested parameters for running postsequencing opera- tional taxonomic unit OTU clustering analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODSITS1 primer assessment and custom primer design.
