The mice were housed in the Central Animal Facility located in the College of Veterinary Medicine at University of Georgia UGA and kept in standard plastic cages with irradiated laboratory animal bedding The Andersons company Maumee OH with each cage housing 4-5 mice.

The BGL and immune responses represented by serum antibodies cytokines and chemokines and histopathology were monitored while the fecal gut microbiome was sequenced for 16S ribosomal RNA to reveal any alterations in gut microbial communities.

The ef- fect of GEN on T1D and glucose regulation has not been fully recognized.

The sex- specific autoimmune disease could also be attributed to differences in gut microbiome  which prompted us to study if GEN modulation of T1D was mediated by microbiome.

The mice were separated from the dams on postnatal day PND 21 and were used in this study after reaching sexual maturity PND 55-60.

The cages were maintained at temperature ranged 22-25 degC and relative humidity 50 - 20 with 12-h light cycles 700-1900.

The cages were changed on a bi-weekly basis or they were changed when the cages became wet because T1D was associated with sani- tary conditions.

The mice were treated humanely and efforts were made to relieve the suffering e.g.

The mice were fed with the soy-based PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 LabDiet St. Louis MO for 5 months and the nutrients were described in .

The Verified Casein Diet 10 IF the phytoestrogen-free 5 K96 diet TestDiet St. Louis MO  is based on the NIH-31 formula except that casein replaces the protein contributed by soy and alfalfa and soy oil is replaced by corn oil to preclude other phytoestrogens that might be present.
