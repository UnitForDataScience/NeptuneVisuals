Since intestinal bacteria influence gut metabolic and immunologic function the fluctuations in bacterial coloniza- tion at the time when immune homeostasis is developing has a profound effect on the infant's general health and the prevention of disease expression later in life.An example of this process is the development of immune tolerance.

These stimulated T-helper cells produce a balanced humoral and cellular immune response in- cluding an appropriate T-regulatory reaction leading to immune tolerance.A major component of intestinal protective function is the capacity to de- velop oral tolerance to commensal bacteria and innocuous antigens.

Thus dysbiosis provides colonizing bacteria which either fail to activate the needed immunoprotective function or actually stimulate a distinct immune response an imbalance in lymphocytes or the up- regulation of immune cells which favor inflammation.

Finally a recent large clinical study suggested that long-term modifications in diet carbohydrate vs. fat affect 5 the individual's enterotype functional clusters of bacteria expression of intestinal bacteria 13.Immunologic Consequences of Normal ColonizationEvidence exists that during a full-term pregnancy components of mucosal im- mune function in the fetuses can develop.

Why is this im- portant Cross talk with colonizing bacteria in the developing neonatal intestine helps in the initial adaptation of the infant to extrauterine life particularly in acquiring immune homeostasis and provides protection against disease expression e.g.

Immune tolerance to innocuous antigens and commensal bacteria is the absence of a sys- temic immune response to their stimulus and thus an absence of autoimmune disease states.

In addition intestinal bacteria induced by breastfeeding can stimu- late enterocyte genes that both promote intestinal development and immune protection 9.

Evidence is provided that colonizing bacteria activate the appropriate expression of intestinal defenses including compo- nents of the mucosal barrier as well as both innate and adaptive immune re- sponses including oral tolerance.

Factors in breast milk affect the composition of intestinal microbiota by stimulating pioneer bacteria which are essential in the activation of intestinal immune defenses such as polymeric IgA production.
