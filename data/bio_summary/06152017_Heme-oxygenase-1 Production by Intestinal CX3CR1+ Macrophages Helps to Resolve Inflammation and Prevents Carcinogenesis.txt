We compared CX3CR1thGFP WT to CX3CR1GFPGFP KO and CX3CR1thGFP-APCmin WT toCX3CR1GFPGFP-APCmin KO.

During further cycles the difference between WT and KO became even stronger in particular for the inability of KO mice to regain weight.

Disease activity index as described in Materials and Methods B and polyps' number are higher in KO mice while colon length is shorter C. D Immunofluorescence of GFPth macrophages in the polyps of CX3CR1GFPGFP and CX3CR1thGFP mice after treatment with AOMDSS KO mice have increased infiltration of GFPth macrophages.

IL10 and IL20 were higher in KO mice proinflammatory cytokines were still upregulated at day 13 in KO mice while they were decreased in recovering WT mice.

The expression of inflammatory mediators was high at day 10 in both WT and KO mice but at day13 the mRNA levels of TNFa IL6 IL1b and COX2 were decreased in WT mice while KO mice still showed sustained levels in spite of significantly higher production of IL10 and IL20 Fig.

Considering the lower levels of HMOX-1 in KO mice we tested the in vitro phagocytic ability of macrophages from WT and KO mice.

At day 0 almost no differences were detectable between WT and KO on the contrary at sacrifice three genera- tions were markedly different between KO and WT samples Akkermansia Lachnospira and Bacteroides.

6B right while it was identically represented at day 0 in untreated WT and KO mice.To test whether the intestinal microbiota can influence the microenvironment and has an impact on the CAC model we cohoused WT and KO mice.

Strikingly treatment with coPP was able to switch off inflamma- tion also in KO mice compared with vehicle-treated mice disease index scores were close to 0 and KO mice showed a recovery in weight similar to that of WT mice Fig.
