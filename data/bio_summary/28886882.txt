methotrexate and doxorubicin were shown to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in rat bm mesenchymal stem cells and when these cells were exposed to either etoposide or doxorubicin both drugs increased the tendency of bm mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into adipose cells or osteoclasts .

for instance when the mbc proportions normalize do these emerging cells possess the same antigen specificities as those that were lost the findings from the rhesus monkey model assessing mbcs after doxorubicin administration suggest that depots of vaccine-specific mbcs might exist at other anatomical sites such as secondary lymphoid tissues contributing to the swift recovery of per- ipheral mbcs after completion of chemotherapy.

in this regard the effects of orally administered metho- trexate on mbcs have been studied in children with paediatric rheu- matic disease however without any evidence of depletion of mbcs or impaired igg secretion after activation of pbmcs compared to age- matched controls .yet some key questions regarding mbcs during chemotherapy re-main unanswered.

for instance one study found that regardless of treatment intensity children suffering from loss of antibodies against vaccine-specific antigens after completion of all treatment were younger than children without such loss with median age of 3 vs. median age of 7 years respectively .

this survival niche has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo in murine models and includes a variety of cells and proteins including stromal cells scs eosinophils basophils myeloid precursor cells megakaryocytes and a range of so- luble survival factors .

following this clonal expansion a fraction of mbcs form secondary gcs and go through a process of af- finity maturation before differentiating into new pcs and mbcs while others differentiate directly into antibody-secreting pcs .there are several different classification systems for mbcs .

activation of mbcs leads to down-regulation of cd21 complement receptor 2 which enables further characterization of these cells as resting cd27cd21 and activated cd27cd21low- mbcs .

it should be emphasized however that the distribution of mbcs in different body compartments is not even  and if a missing relationship between serological memory and mbcs would still hold after assessment of vaccine-specific mbcs from other anatomical sites remains to be elucidated.

although functional studies of mbcs in paediatric all patients are rare it has been shown that polyclonal b-cell activation of pbmcs induced lowerigm and igg-producing cells compared to healthy controls 1 month after cessation of therapy but these differences disappeared over6 months post therapy .how individual chemotherapeutic agents affect mbcs is unclear.

therefore in the view of secondary immunodeficiency in che- motherapy-treated children it is likely that revaccination may have been of value even for those who did not respond with obviously pro- tective antibody titres against certain immunogens.humoral immunity during homeostasiscrosstalk between stromal cells and long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow survival niche maintains serological memorysoluble antibodies in serum are the most reliable clinical laboratory testing available to indicate adequate immune response to vaccination .

in support of this long-term methotrexate treatment caused a significant increase in the density of adipose cells in the bm of rats and plasma isolated from these methotrexate-treated rats promoted differentiation of bm mesenchymal stem cells into osteoclasts in vitro .

further in germ- free mice or mice treated with antibiotics prior to platinum che- motherapy a lower cytotoxicity was observed suggesting that an intact microbiota also modulates the response to treatment .while research assessing microbiota changes in paediatric all pa- tients is lacking daunorubicin etoposide and cyclophosphamide are all used to treat children with all  suggesting that similar alterations might occur in the microbiota of these children.

likewise basophils and megakaryocytes produce april and il-6 while the bmscs secrete il-6 and other bm-resident cells including myeloid precursor and mac-1f480 cells are sources of april .an additional potent pc survival factor is b-cell activating factor baff  whose mrna has been detected in human vc- am1cxcl12 bmscs though it remains to be demonstrated that these scs actually secrete the baff protein.
