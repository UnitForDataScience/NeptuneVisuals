Furthermore our current knowledge regarding post- chemotherapy antibody levels and protection rates is also incomplete due to the great variations in the type of immunogen studied study design age of included subjects and follow-up time after cessation of chemotherapy summarized in .

Further we il- luminate the emerging evidence for a relationship between chemotherapy and gut microbiota which could play an important role in vaccine responses and the shaping of a young immune system subjected to maturation and recovery.IntroductionWhy pay attention to insufficiencies in serological immunity of cancer survivorsAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL is by far the most common paediatric malignancy worldwide accounting for roughly 25 of all cases of childhood cancer .

However contemporary chemotherapy regimens still have a range of harmful long term sequelae including cardiac dysfunction osteonecrosis cognitive dysfunction and secondary neo- plasms .

In addition we will put forward the relationship between chemotherapy and perturbations in the gut microbiota which could play a pivotal role in the shaping of a young immune system subjected to maturation and reconstitution.

Indeed this aspect has been somewhat neglected de- spite that the rate of immune reconstitution after chemotherapy is heavily dependent on children's age .

Similarly other groups have shown a significant association between older age at di- agnosis and protective antibody levels against measles mumps rubellatetanus and varicella zoster virus when the titres were measured at leastone year after cessation of chemotherapy .
