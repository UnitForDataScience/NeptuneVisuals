the first was that many insects appear to require the same set of b vitamins as mammals which was interpreted as indicative of a lack of novelty in insect vitamin nutrition and the second is that the absence of specific symptoms of b vitamin deficiency in insects which was seen to undermine the utility of insects as biomedical models for human b vitamin nutrition.as this review describes some insects do not conform to the mammalian b vitamin requirements.

as a result insects have optimal performance on artificial diets with a broad range of b vitamin concentrations obviating the need for precise optimization of dietary b vitamin concentrations to the quantitative requirements of differ- ent developmental stages genotypes or species of insect.a second important consequence of the ready elimination of excess b vitamins is that insects have limited capacity for b vitamin storage and therefore require a regular supply of these micronutrients.

because of this the die- tary requirement of an insect for a b vitamin is generally evident in the first generation on the vitamin-deficient diet for example as high pre-adult mortality or extended development time and the contribution of diet and microorganisms in the insect can be assessed by a factorial experimental design comparing the performance of insects withwithout or depleted microbial content on diets with sufficientdepleted b vitamin content .although the chemistry of b vitamins facilitates diet- based approaches to investigate the b vitamin nutrition of insects the early literature is confused and confusing.

as the genomes of other insects are sequenced and annotated additional examples of shared insect-microbial metabolic pathways in b vitamin synthesis may come to light.biomarkers of b vitamin statusbiomarkers are quantitative indices of the b vitamin nutritional status of an animal offering functional insights that cannot be obtained from either the genetic capacity for metabolic function genomic studies or performance data dietary studies.

dietary studies indicate that d. fasciatus derives the full set of eight b vitamins from actinobacterial symbionts in the gut and elevated expression of insect genes that function in b vitamin transport and processing provide excellent biomarkers of deficiency of each b vitamin in microbe-free insects on low vitamin diets  strate the role of wigglesworthia symbionts in b6 and b9 nutrition especially in pregnant females of this viviparous insect.

the resultant viability of drosophila under a wider range of retinoid dietary regimes than is possible for mammalian models provides added value of the drosophila system as a model for mammalian vitamin a nutrition.in conclusion recent advances in the analytical and genomic resources together with the great diversity of the nutritional ecology and microbiology of insects offer new opportunities for significant discovery in insect b vitamin nutrition.acknowledgementsthis work was supported by nsf grant ios-1354743 and the sarkaria institute of insect physiology and toxicology.references and recommended readingpapers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted asof special interest of outstanding interestthis review provides a valuable introduction to the early literature on insect b vitamin nutrition.

collectively these approaches can reveal how the b vitamin require- ments of insects are met and how b vitamin deficiency is manifested in insects.

i conclude with a prospects on future research opportunities for insect b vitamin nutri- tion including the use of insects as models for b vitamin deficiencies in humans.

recent studies have built on the classic research of sang by addressing the microbial contribution todrosophila b vitamin nutrition with evidence that the microbiota spares a dietary b2 and b9 requirement for larval development .the genomic basis of b vitamin nutrition genomics offer complementary evidence to dietary stud- ies.

perhaps the very slow growth rates of cicada nymphs relative to sharpshooters mayenable cicadas to subsist on the exceptionally low b vitamin content of xylem sap.the validity of inferences from genomic data about the capability for b vitamin synthesis depends critically on the quality of the gene annotations.

a biomarker can be direct that is absolute concentrations of vitamers in body tissues or functional that is molecular or biochemical traits that are dependent on b vitamin availability.the value of biomarker studies is illustrated by recent research on the b vitamin nutrition of a heteropteran bug the african cotton stainer dysdercus fasciatus and glossina tsetse flies.

in principle bio- marker approaches can be applied beyond the laboratory to natural insect populations creating the opportunity to investigate insect b vitamin nutrition under field conditions.it is also timely to re-consider the value of insects as biomedical models of b vitamin nutrition.

with the increasing availability of direct and functional biomarkers of the b vitamin status of insects the biomedical signifi- cance of lack of specific symptoms of individual b vitamin deficiencies is much-reduced.
