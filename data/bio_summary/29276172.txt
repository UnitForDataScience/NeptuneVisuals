Compared with healthy control mice strep-tomycin-treated and S. Tm-infected mice exhibited a significant decrease in Clostridia and Bacteroidetes populations and a bloom of the Enterobacteriaceae population A. Cecal butyrate levels were significantly decreased and lactate levels were elevated in streptomycin-treated and S. Tm-infected mice compared with mock-treated controls B and 3C.

Unweighted principal coordi- nate analysis of microbiota composition showed distinct clustering of the microbiota of mock-treated mice compared with that of infected mice A. Taxonomic analysis of microbiota composition of mock-treated mice revealed that during S. Tm infection the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were significantly decreased B.

This analysis identified several extracellular metabolites with differential abundance in the cecal contents of infected mice compared with mock-treated mice.

After 8 days of infection the mice were euthanized and lactate concentration in the cecal content was analyzed by GCMSMS.Groups of Swiss Webster mice were intragastrically inoculated with a 11 ratio of the indicated S. Tm strains.

To determine whether exogenous supple- mentation with butyrate was sufficient to suppress the spike in lactate levels streptomycin-treated mice were orally treated with tributyrin glyceryl tributyrate D. This exogenous supplementation with a butyrate source significantly decreased the cecal lactate concentration 3 days after streptomycin treatment.In germ-free mice colonocytes perform lactate fermentation due to a lack of microbial short-chain fatty acids  .

In contrast a bloom of Gammaproteobacteria the class to which S. Tm belongs was observed C. In agreement with our initial profiling Table S1 targeted measure- ments of butyrate by GCMS demonstrated that mock-treated mice had nearly 10-fold higher levels of butyrate in their cecal content compared with that of S. Tm-infected mice D and a concomitant increase in lactate concentrations A.

This metabolic switch has also been shown in germ-free mice  and in ex vivo-cultured colonocytes from DSS-treated mice   a chemical model of experimental colitis.

Male and female mice aged 6-8 weeks were used for all experiments and no differences between male and female mice were identified.

Administration of a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor blunted lactate production in germ-free mice suggesting that lactate was predominantly of host origin.

Groups of Swiss Webster mice were intragastrically inoculated with the S. Tm wild-type strain or mock treated with Lysogeny Broth-Miller LB broth.
