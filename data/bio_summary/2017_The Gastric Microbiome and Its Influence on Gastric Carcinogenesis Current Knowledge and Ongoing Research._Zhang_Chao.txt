Only a small proportion of GC is associated with EBV infection therefore most epidemiologic studies cannot find strong correlations due to the limited data.Although EBV has been suspected in several other upper GI diseases most studies to date are only case reportsand a lack of large- scale studies cannot currently support the causal relationships between EBV and these diseases.OtherBecause of a lack of understanding of the gastric microbiome as a whole most epidemiologic studies are limited to H pylori and EBV.Only a few studies have looked at the community of bacteria and their overall relationship to GC.

Several studies also mention frequency of the phyla Fusobacteria.Numerous other phyla have also been detected in lower abundance across gastric samples.Prevalent species consistent across multiple studies included Streptococcus sp Lactobacillus sp Veillonella sp Prevotella sp Rothia sp and Neisseria sp see .

These studies provide an important understanding of EBV involvement in gastric carcinogenesis.Latent infection in gastric epithelial cellsPrevious studies reveal that EBV can readily infect B lymphocytes through viral recep- tor CD21.

Different studies have reported several sets of genes that are hypermethylated in EBVaGC rather than other GC subtypes but there is no single gene present in all 3 major studies on the topic.Viral microRNAsThe EBV genome encodes 25 microRNA miRNA precursors and 44 mature miRNAs.

Subse- quent structural enzymatic and adhesive adaptive advantages further enable these bacteria and others to colonize the environment.Multiple studies have attempted to characterize the microbial components of the stomach either directly from biopsy samples or from gastric juices.

The most dominant bacterial phyla found across multiple studies are Proteobac- teria Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes.

In one study up to 87 of bacteria were shared between normal tissues from patients indicating that the esophagus may house a less diverse population of bacteria between individ- uals than the stomach.A more detailed set of studies investigating esophageal microbiota demonstrated at least 2 distinct microbiome profiles distinguish healthy normal esophageal tissue from gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD patients.

Two main species frequently inhabit the gut Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae MSS likely metabolically supporting sur- rounding bacterial communities.Although few studies to date have attempted to elucidate archaea from the stomach specifically it is highly likely given their ecology that these microbes are found in abundance throughout the GI tract.Methanoarchaea are frequently able to form syntrophic interactions with a wide range of bacterial constituents and in some cases are necessary for their survival metabolic function and growth.For some beneficial bacteria they are necessary cohabitants of the environment.

Many patients with IBS and constipation excrete methane suggesting an overabun- dance of methanogenic archaea in their gut.In a more recent study differences in archaea and microbial composition were observed in colorectal tubular adenoma and adenocarcinoma cases between both healthy and diseased mucosa.It is apparent from such studies that archaea have the potential to influence both commu- nity structure within the microbiome and immune response.

Comparative studies of fungi colonizing gastric ulcers found 54.2 of cases had fungal infections compared with 10.3 of6Zhang et althose with chronic gastritis and 4.3 of controls.
