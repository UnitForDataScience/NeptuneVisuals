In both weighted and unweighted UniFrac analyses effects of bothdiet treatments and sampling origin were highly significant all P 10-5 with 99999 permutations while the interaction was more significant using weighted P 0.028 than un- weighted P 0.048 UniFrac-based analysis showing that sample origin faecal or caecal affected the response of mi- crobiota in the five diet treatments.

The 0.9 nanoSe had significantly higher overall SCFA production than inorganic P  0.0055 organic P  0.0274 and 1.5 nanoSe P 0.0202.

Individual t test comparisons performed for each day separately show that the only comparisons with significant differences in weight were those comparing organic or inorgan- ic Se groups with slowest growing 0.3 mgkg nanoSe where comparisons for every weight measuring time point after week 1 were significantly differential with P 0.005 for organic and P 0.006-0.024 for inorganic Se control vs 0.3 nanoSe.

a b.Overall microbiota compositionOverall the caecal samples had higher richness P 0.002 and evenness P 9.34E-4 than the faecal samples.

Multivariate RDA analysis indicated significant difference between the treatments at both OTU P 0.002 and genus level P 0.001 Fig.

The only significant differences between SCFA concentrations were significantly higher acetic acid compared to isobutyric acid P  0.0311 and isovaleric acid P 0.0457.DiscussionResults showed that nanoSe supplementation in feed did not significantly affect bird weight but indicated the presence ofFig.
