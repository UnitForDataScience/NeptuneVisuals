there was significant difference between individ- ual scfas p 0.0004 and in scfa profiles between the treatments p 0.0014. the 0.9 nanose had significantly higher overall scfa production than inorganic p  0.0055 organic p  0.0274 and 1.5 nanose p 0.0202. the differences in individual scfas are shownfig.

in both weighted and unweighted unifrac analyses effects of bothdiet treatments and sampling origin were highly significant all p 10-5 with 99999 permutations while the interaction was more significant using weighted p 0.028 than un- weighted p 0.048 unifrac-based analysis showing that sample origin faecal or caecal affected the response of mi- crobiota in the five diet treatments.

individual t test comparisons performed for each day separately show that the only comparisons with significant differences in weight were those comparing organic or inorgan- ic se groups with slowest growing 0.3 mgkg nanose where comparisons for every weight measuring time point after week 1 were significantly differential with p 0.005 for organic and p 0.006-0.024 for inorganic se control vs 0.3 nanose.

multivariate rda analysis indicated significant difference between the treatments at both otu p 0.002 and genus level p 0.001 fig.

at the otu level 31 of all otus were significantly p 0.05 altered in relative abundance between the treatments.
