in addition it may encourage the patient to undertake dietary therapies with the guidance of their doctor andor dietitian rather than using self-diagnosis trial and error or dr google.7  future dietary research-- optimizing research design as discussed above studies assessing the effect of dietary change are notoriously difficult to undertake.21 key steps for the evaluation of dietary modalities are outlined in figure 1 and should consider the following  subject numberschallenges in designing and undertaking dietary studies have led to small subject numbers in the vast majority of studies.

201830e13238.httpsdoi.org10.1111nmo.13238c 2017 john wiley  sons ltd  1 of 202  dietary therapies for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome due to the heterogeneity of functional gastrointestinal symptoms it is unlikely that a single dietary therapy will be suitable for all patients.19 as such various dietary strategies have emerged for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions which are being used without uniformity across centers and regions.

this is a biproduct of a multitude of factors including difficulties in isolating single nutrient in- teractions among the milieu of dietary intake difficulty in appropriately blinding participants and high placebo and nocebo response rates.21 dietary studies have been undertaken in four main ways firstly through observational studies or clinical audits22 secondly through using food challenge23 thirdly through comparisons to another diet such as the current standard dietary therapy24 or habitual diet25 or sham diet26 or another therapeutic diet27 and finally through comparing extreme's eg low vs high fodmap fermentable oligo- di- mono-saccharide andpolyols diets.28 all modes of assessment have strengths and limitations and provide different insight.

the studies have been criticized due to small subject numbers potential for unblinding and the possibility for placebo response to in- fluence the reported response rates.3334 although not directly compa- rable to a placebo-drug a sham diet used by staudacher et al 2017 provided adequate relief in 38 of patients compared 57 with the low fodmap diet intention-to-treat analysis p  .051 providing a 19 benefit over the sham diet.26 placebo response in ibs is high ranging from 3 to 8435 with additional challenges for the design of dietary intervention trials which should be considered in the interpre- tation of study results33 and are discussed below.multiple studies have also assessed the use of the gluten-free diet2336-39 but criticism has drawn attention to the difficulty of iso- lating gluten from other components in wheat as well as difficulty in appropriately excluding celiac disease prior to subject enrolment.40 similarly many studies have investigated the role of increased or de- creased intake of various forms of dietary fiber but inconsistencies in the type of fiber used or population studied makes formation ofguidelines difficult.41 to date the best evidence is for the use of psyl- lium fiber in ibs which has been reviewed elsewhere.2942 prebiotic fiber supplements provide promise due to their theoretical beneficial effect on the colonic microbiota but overlap of some prebiotics with fodmap composition fructans and galacto-oligoasaccharides sug- gests some varieties may worsen symptoms of ibs.29 there is also potential for the use of strain-specific probiotics to target-specific symptom types but current evidence is limited by lack of intention- to-treat analyses and inconsistencies in the types of single- or multi- strain probiotic used.29 other dietary therapies receiving attention include the specific carbohydrate diet diets for the treatment of smallintestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo the paleo diet low histamine or food chemical diets and modified protein diets none of which have a significant body of literature or proven mechanisms of action.

the national institute for clinical excellence nice guidelines are considered as first-linetable 1 dietary therapies for the management of gastrointestinal symptomsdiets with a primary focus on eating patterndiets with a primary focus on carbohydrates andor fibermodified fiber dietsmodification of various components of fiber can be made through addition of a fiber supplement or individu- alized adaptation of the patients' dietary fiber intake through increased or decreased fiber intake.current guidelines for ibs suggest increasing dietary fiber intake where applicable and considering use of supplemen- tation with up to 24 gday of linseeds.43highly fermentable soluble eg fructo-oligosaccharides galacto-oligosaccharides resistant starch pectin inulin guar gum and fermentable insoluble eg wheat bran lignin fibers are likely to create additional gas production within the large intestine and therefore may not be well tolerated in patients with ibs.117 on the contrary insoluble non- fermentable fibers eg cellulose sterculia methylcel- lulose create low amounts of gas and are likely to be better tolerated in ibs117 although this has not been extensively studied.

for example the use of low histamine or low chemical diets which are generally targeted toward patients who exhibit gas- trointestinal symptoms combined with extra-intestinal symptoms such as eczema rhinitis nasal congestion and headaches.47 prediction of response and individualized dietary therapy is discussed below.3  safety issues related to dietary therapies in irritable bowel syndrome as with side-effects from drugs dietary therapies have specific safety issues.

changes to nutrient intake have also been noted following institution of the low fodmap diet with reductions in total energy carbohydrate fiber and calcium in- take reported during the initial restrictive phase.242531 these effects may resolve following re-challenge as suggested by data to date from long-term studies.5051 it may be that the institution of any diet and or involvement in a dietary study has effects on total energy intake as total energy intake was also reduced in comparison groups rand- omized to the nice guidelines.2431 the potential to reduce total en- ergy macro- or micro-nutrient intake with institution of any diet as shown in the above-mentioned studies highlights the need for close dietetic monitoring and long-term follow-up with patients undertak- ing dietary modification.the length of time the patient is required to follow any dietary intervention also plays a role in the level of concern regarding the nutritional adequacy of the diet in question.

for example 21 healthy controls followed a gluten-free diet for 4-weeks resulting in changes to the microbiota including reducing the clostridia class.55 another study of 10 healthy con- trols noted reductions in bifidobacterium clostridium lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions.56 it is likely that there is a multitude of dietary factors that may influence the microbiota following dietary restriction even if only one dietary component is targeted.

firstly will dietary therapy be successful in a particular individual and if so which type of diet can we predict who will re- spond to a particular dietary therapy and importantly who will not in those who are unlikely to respond would another diet therapy be more effective or is another therapeutic modality better indicated secondly what level of restriction would the dietary therapy need to be for theindividual to benefit finally could the therapy type be modified for the individual rather than using blanket one-size-fits-all approaches modifying diets to the individual has potential to reduce the level of restriction required for example targeting only sorbitol and fructans instead of all fodmaps or targeting only amines and glutamates in- stead of all bioactive food chemicals.

however results were not dependent on compliance to the diet169 suggesting either strict adherence is not required or effects were seen through other elements of the dietary change.continuestable 2 continuedconfocal laser endomicroscopyepithelial tight junctions changesthis technique can identify subtle epithelial changes in response to acute exposure to foods and its application has been limited to common antigen mixtures of cow's milk wheat yeast and soy.identification of dietary proteins with positive reactions has been suggested to represent the cause of ibs.170food antigens exposure to suspected food antigens via endoscopy caused immediate breaks increased intervil- lous spaces and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa in 22 of 36 patients with ibs and suspected food intolerance.170 these changes were reported to be associated with symptom improvement following individualized exclusion diets based on results from the confocal laser endomicroscopy with a 50 reduction in symptom score in 19 of the 22 patients.170othervolatile organic compoundsan inexpensive non-invasive biomarker measured in fecal samples with preliminary data available for potential use to predict response to dietary therapy.low fodmap diet preliminary data suggest that volatile organic compounds may assist to predict response to therapy.175fodmap denotes fermentable oligo- di- mono-saccharides and polyols ibs denotes irritable bowel syndrome mri denotes magnetic resonance imaging nice diet denotes national institute for clinical excellence diet sibo denotes small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.double-blind placebo-controlled trials are utilized to reduce both the placebo and nocebo effect and provide the highest quality of evidence possible.

underreporting of total energy intake in food records can range from 11.9 to 44.103 in addition to underreporting partici- pants are likely to alter their dietary intake during the food record period.1038  future dietary research--key research questions  efficacyas highlighted in table 1 many of the existing dietary modifications currently lack supporting evidence of efficacy.

prevalence of dietary therapies in functional bowel disorderswith the vast majority of ibs patients reporting that food exacerbates their symptoms it is not surprising that many patients are following various forms of dietary manipulation based on information provided by the internet lay press advertising or through recommendations from members of the health care system.

difficulties in assessing dietary therapies for functional bowel disordersdietary trials are extraordinarily difficult to undertake in a well- controlled manner resulting in debate as to the ability to compare methodologies used for dietary vs drug therapies.

order of use and targeting symptom phenotypes in functional bowel disordersthe range of dietary therapies available creates the issue of choosing which therapy to trial in the individual and if unsuccessful whether another dietary therapy may be worthwhile.

using the gluten-free diet as an example is the alteration in the microbiota composition a consequence of removing the gluten itself removing the gluten-containing food eg wheat introduction of foods that gluten is replaced with often high in sugar and fat and low in fiber or a consequence of all of these dietary changes combinedthere has been particular concern regarding the low fodmap diet effects on the microbiota in part because it is the most studied dietary intervention to date25262857-61 and is currently widely used.
