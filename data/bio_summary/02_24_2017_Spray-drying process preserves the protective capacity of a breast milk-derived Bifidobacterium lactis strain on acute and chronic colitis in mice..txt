E Representative histological sections stained by May Grunwald Giemsa 100X magnification of mice treated with skim milk and administrated Control TNBS or not heathy mice with TNBS and mice that were treated with fresh or spray-dried B. lactis INL1 and BB12 before and one day after TNBS administration.

F Representative histological sections stained by May-Grunwald- Giemsa 100X magnification of mice treated with skim milk and administrated Control TNBS or not heathy mice with TNBS and mice that were treated with fresh or spray-dried B. lactis INL1 and BB12 during all the experiment.

Mice were treatedwith the probiotics by daily intragastric administration 2 x 108 CFU in 200 ml 20 wv skim milk or by 20 wv skim milk control healthy mice and control TNBS for five consecutive days before colitis induction intrarectal administration of TNBS at 110 mgKg and 1 day after TNBS administration.

The mean value of moisture of the powders obtained after spray dry- ing was 3.89 - 0.09 and 4.22 - 1.59 wtwt for B. lactis INL1 and B. lactis BB12 respectively.

The anti-inflammatory properties of the bifido- bacteria were evaluated by the daily intra-gastric administration of live bacteria 2 x 108 CFU of freshly cultured or spray-dried bacteria in 20 wv skim milk or 20 wv skim milk for the TNBS control or healthy control mice every day during all the experimental procedure from D0 to D15.Colons were removed at sacrifice 48 h after the last TNBS administration washed and opened.

Resistance of B. lactis INL-1 and B. lactis BB12 to spray drying in 20 wv skim milk.Mean -SD.

lactis B. lactis INL1 and B. lactis BB12 largely described as beneficial in a number of inflammatory conditionsand study the impact of spray-drying on the anti-inflammatory functionality of both strains.ResultsThe spray-drying did not decrease bacterial survival.

As expected TNBS treatment after 48 h induction reduced body weight by 13 and induced a strong colitis highlighted both by a high macroscopic score Wallace score of 5.9 - 0.6 as well as a high histological score Ameho score of 5.7 - 0.2 E. Both fresh cultures of B. lactis INL1 and BB12 were able to significantly protect mice from colitis as shown by a strong and significant reduction of both macroscopic p  0.01 and histological p  0.001 E scores of inflammation leading to a pro- tective effect of 53.8 and 56.8 respectively.

Results indicated levels of IL-10 IL-12 and IFNg released by bacteria-stimulated and control human PBMCs for 24 hours and levels of IL-10IL-12 ratio mean-SEM of 5 independent experiments.The indications or  meaning p 0.05 refer to the comparison of bifidobacteria-stimulated PBMCs versus untreated cells medium control or versus L. acidophilus-stimulated PBMC  L. acidophilus effect respectively.upregulation of these pro-inflammatory genes  in comparison to control healthy mice that received only skim milk but not challenged with TNBS normalized to 1.The anti-inflammatory capacity of fresh and spray-dried forms of B. lactis INL1 and BB12 strains was confirmed in a model of chronic colitis.
