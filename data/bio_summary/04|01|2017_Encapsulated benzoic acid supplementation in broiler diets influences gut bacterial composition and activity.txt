It has been reported that BA can be produced by lactic acid bacteria in ruminants such as Lactobacillus especially L. acidophilus and to a lesser extent Streptococcus Lactococcus and Bifidobacterium through dif- ferent metabolic pathways like microbial enzymatic conver- sion of hippuric acid Del Olmo et al.

Another study including 0.1 free BA in broiler diets showed no effect on lactic acid bacteria in the crop and small intestine but an increase in the caecal lactic acid bacteria cell number was displayed Giannenas et al.

.Benzoic acid BA is widely used in pig nutrition and has been shown to improve body weight gain BWG feed intake FI and feed conversion ratio FCR Kluge et al.

Studies based on in vitro and in vivo trials demonstrated that BA reduced coliformsCONTACT F. Goodarzi BoroojeniDepartment of Veterinary Medicine Institute of Animal Nutrition Freie Universitat Berlin Berlin Germanyc 2017 British Poultry Science Ltdand lactic acid bacteria Knarreborg et al.

Higher concentrations of BA 0.5- 0.75 depressed growth performance lowered crop and ileal coliforms but increased caecal lactic acid bacteria Jozefiak et al.

This could signify the observed modification of the Lactobacillus species activity andor composition because certain species of this genus produce more D-lactate directly or indirectly via racemase action on L-lactate.The SCFA production by gut microbiota particularly butyric acid may benefit the host bird by supplying energy acceleration of gut epithelial cell proliferation epithelial barrier integrity and intestinal immunity as well as collage- nous and non-collagenous protein synthesis in mucosa Gaudier et al.

No change in lactic acid bacteria in the crop and ileal digesta of birds fed on diets supplemented with 0.2 free BA has been reported Jozefiak et al.
