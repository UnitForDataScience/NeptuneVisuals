At the genus level the PolgA mice had higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and lower levels of Lactobacillus and Helicobacter .Effect of AgingTo investigate the effect of the accelerated aging due to mito- chondrial dysfunction in the PolgAmutmut we compared sedentary PolgAmutmut mice n  15 vs sedentary PolgA mice n  21 bacterial profiles at 4 7 and 11 months while removing the exercise PolgAmutmut mice.

Bacterial profiles of sedentary PolgAmutmut mice were significantly different from the sedentary PolgA mice with increases in Lactobacillus and Mycoplasma and decreases in Alistipes Odoribacter Anaeroplasma Rikenella Parabacteroides and Allobaculum in the PolgAmutmut mice.

All p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the FDR algorithm .ResultsPolg Mice and Wild-Type CharacteristicsA total of 57 samples from months 4 7 and 11 were included in the 16S rRNA gene based analysis subdivided into three separate groups PolgAmutmut exercised mice n  7 mean weight 30 - 3 g at 4 months PolgAmutmut sedentary mice n  5 mean weight 29 - 1 g at 4 months and sedentary PolgA mice n  7 mean weight 30 - 1 g at 4 months.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of COX deficient crypts between the sedentary mean 78 - 6 and exercised mean 77 - 13 PolgAmutmut micep  0.05.Bacterial ProfilesBacteroidetes was the most dominant phylum with the major- ity of mice having at least 50 relative abundance in both the PolgAmutmut and PolgA groups .

There was a significant difference between the PolgAmutmut mice and PolgA at 4 months p  .03 and there were significant within group changes between months 4 and 11 for sedentary and exercise PolgAmutmut mice p  .04 and .04 respectively.

a-Diversity analysis showed temporal significance p  .01 with an increased number of OTUs in the PolgA mice compared with the PolgAmutmut mice overall demonstrating that bac- terial diversity increased in PolgA mice but decreased over time in the PolgAmutmut mice .

Whether mitochondrial dysfunction directly causes the reductions in Allobaculum is unclear however reductions in a primary energy source such as butyrate through reductions in Allobaculum may be contributing to reduced colonic epithelia crypt cell proliferation and increased apoptosis previously reported in PolgAmutmut mice .In addition in the PolgAmutmut mouse small intestine mtDNAmutations were associated with reduced lipid absorption and altered stem progenitor cell cycling .

Twelve PolgAmutmut mice were randomly divided into a sedentary and exercise group at 4 months.
