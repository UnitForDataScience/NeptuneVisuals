Finally we discuss strategies for uncovering the genetic and biochemical bases of these microbial activities and provide an outlook on how understanding gut microbial xenobiotic metabolism will influence personalized nutrition toxicology and medicine.Gut microbial interactions with xenobioticsThe majority of human microbiota-xenobiotic interactions occur within the gastrointestinal GI tract.

Metabolomics in human subjects will play a key role in illuminating currently unappreciated gut microbial metabolic processes particularly for transformations that depend on additional microbial and host activities or interactions 122.Linking uncharacterized genes in microbiomes to xenobiotic metabolismWe should expect to uncover interesting gut microbial activities by investigating the vast number of uncharacterized or misannotated genes present in human gut microbiomes.Strikingly 86 of the genes from HMP stool metagenomes cannot be assigned to known metabolic pathways and half cannot be annotated 10.

Gut microbial xenobiotic metabolites are known to have altered bioactivity bioavailability and toxicity and can interfere with the activities of human xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes to affect the fates of other ingested molecules.Despite the diverse and physiologically significant consequences of these modifications relatively little is known about the specific gut microbial strains genes and enzymes that mediate xenobiotic metabolism.Here we review our current knowledge of how the gut microbiota directly modifies dietary compounds environmental pollutants and pharmaceuticals.

Overall human and microbial metabolism generates a complex intertwined metabolic network that affects both the host and the members of the microbiota.The complementary chemistry of microbial xenobiotic metabolismWithin the unique and complex ecology of the human gut microorganisms transform ingested substrates via a broad range of enzymatic reactions.

This issue highlights the value of culture-based experimentsKoppel et al.Page 4and rigorous biochemical characterization of gut microbial enzymes in understanding xenobiotic metabolism.Host xenobiotic metabolismAny discussion of microbial xenobiotic transformations must also consider host chemical capabilities.

The gut lumen is rich in both host and microbial proteases and studies increasingly indicate that differential microbial proteolytic activity may directly contribute to human disease.

When evaluating the safety of these compounds it is thus crucial to consider the consequences of gut microbial metabolism.Here we discuss several types of chemicals that have been implicated in human disease risk and for which there is evidence that gut microbial metabolism affects toxicity.Chemicals used in industrial manufacturingGut microbes reductively metabolize azo compounds some of the first industrially important synthetic chemicals 40.

Elucidating how gut microbes process these compounds may contribute significantly to our fundamental understanding of their effects.Gut microbial biotransformation comes of age recent case studiesAttempts to decipher the biological consequences of gut microbial xenobiotic metabolism have been hindered by our poor understanding of these transformations.

abundance and distribution in the gut microbiome and host health status including exposure to xenobiotics 16 124.Harnessing knowledge of microbial metabolism to improve human healthDeciphering how gut microbial transformation of xenobiotics affects host health will require the integration of clinical studies with mechanistic experiments in model systems and organisms Fig.

Potential implications of understanding gut microbial xenobiotic metabolismA Interfacing clinical studies and hypothesis-driven research in model systems is essential for elucidating the biological consequences of gut microbial xenobiotic metabolism.
