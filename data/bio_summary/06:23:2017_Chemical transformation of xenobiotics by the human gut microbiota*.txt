finally we discuss strategies for uncovering the genetic and biochemical bases of these microbial activities and provide an outlook on how understanding gut microbial xenobiotic metabolism will influence personalized nutrition toxicology and medicine.gut microbial interactions with xenobioticsthe majority of human microbiota-xenobiotic interactions occur within the gastrointestinal gi tract.

from healthy individuals 53. identification of specific proteases responsible for gut microbial gluten processing could not only enable a better understanding of cd but also inform therapeutic interventions for this disease including enzymatic or probiotic treatments.gut microbes can also metabolize amino acids obtained from dietary protein including l- phenylalanine l-tyrosine and l-tryptophan into a range of bioactive products 54. for example gut bacteria can metabolize l-tryptophan into many products including the antioxidant indole-3-propionic acid the neurotransmitter tryptamine and indole the latter of which can undergo hydroxylation and sulfation by hepatic enzymes to generate the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate 55-57.dietary lipidsvariable gut microbial metabolism of lipids and lipid-derived compounds is associated with a variety of human diseases 58 59. an intriguing example is dietary cholesterol a major component of western diets that is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseasekoppel et al.page 860. while ingested cholesterol is absorbed in the small intestine and subsequently undergoes biliary excretion and enterohepatic circulation gut microbial reduction of cholesterol generates coprostanol which cannot be reabsorbed and is excreted.

cyclamate was banned in the usa after studies suggested cyclohexylamine was carcinogenic and both this finding and the continued use of this sweetener remain controversial 70. a cyclamate hydrolyzing enzyme has been partially purified from a guinea pig-associated strain but human gut microbial hydrolases with this activity have not been identified 29. gut microbes can also metabolize the artificial sweeteners stevioside and xylitol using unknown enzymes 71 72. interestingly the gut microbiota acquires the ability to transform xylitol and cyclohexamate after prolonged exposure suggesting that long-term ingestion of dietary components can select for new microbial metabolic functions 73. understanding the microbiota's role in metabolizing components of processed foodskoppel et al.page 9could be important for assessing food safety and the long-term effects of food additives on human health.heterocyclic aminesfinally an understanding of gut microbial metabolic activities could provide new insights into the biological consequences of cooking practices and food preparation.

metabolomics in human subjects will play a key role in illuminating currently unappreciated gut microbial metabolic processes particularly for transformations that depend on additional microbial and host activities or interactions 122.linking uncharacterized genes in microbiomes to xenobiotic metabolismwe should expect to uncover interesting gut microbial activities by investigating the vast number of uncharacterized or misannotated genes present in human gut microbiomes.strikingly 86 of the genes from hmp stool metagenomes cannot be assigned to known metabolic pathways and half cannot be annotated 10. many members of large enzyme superfamilies also have unknown functions and are typically misannotated.

gut microbial xenobiotic metabolites are known to have altered bioactivity bioavailability and toxicity and can interfere with the activities of human xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes to affect the fates of other ingested molecules.despite the diverse and physiologically significant consequences of these modifications relatively little is known about the specific gut microbial strains genes and enzymes that mediate xenobiotic metabolism.here we review our current knowledge of how the gut microbiota directly modifies dietary compounds environmental pollutants and pharmaceuticals.

overall human and microbial metabolism generates a complex intertwined metabolic network that affects both the host and the members of the microbiota.the complementary chemistry of microbial xenobiotic metabolismwithin the unique and complex ecology of the human gut microorganisms transform ingested substrates via a broad range of enzymatic reactions.

this issue highlights the value of culture-based experimentskoppel et al.page 4and rigorous biochemical characterization of gut microbial enzymes in understanding xenobiotic metabolism.host xenobiotic metabolismany discussion of microbial xenobiotic transformations must also consider host chemical capabilities.

reductase enzymes utilize various cofactors nadph flavin fe-s clusters siroheme molybdenum-cofactor and other metallocofactors to mediate the transfer of electrons or hydride equivalents h 2e- to substrates 34-36. biochemical and structural characterization of gut microbial reductases has uncovered individual enzymes that display broad substrate scope and can transform multiple functional groups and consequently their endogenous substrates and in vivo relevance are often unclear.reduction typically decreases the polarity of compounds and can alter charge hybridization and electrophilicity which can affect the lifetimes and activities of metabolites in the body 37-39. notably electron transfer to xenobiotics likely enables anaerobic respiration in the human gut where oxygen is largely unavailable to serve as a terminal electron acceptor.while reductase enzymes are found in humans many reductive transformations are uniquely microbial 6 37 40 and have not yet been linked to known enzymes or organisms.koppel et al.page 6functional group transfer reactionstransferase enzymes move functional groups between two substrates using nucleophilic substitution reactions.

reactions catalyzed by gut microbial gres include generation of trimethylamine tma by choline trimethylamine-lyase cutc 46 and decarboxylation of the tyrosine-derived metabolite p-hydroxyphenylacetate by p- hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase hpad 47. this latter reaction produces p-cresol a molecule that competes with xenobiotics for o-sulfation and detoxification by host enzymes 48.uncharacterized xenobiotic metabolismthe vast majority of gut microbial xenobiotic transformations cannot be linked to specific enzymes and organisms.

while not comprehensive this overview highlights particularly exciting opportunities for gut microbial enzyme discovery and characterization.metabolism of dietary compoundsgut microbes process an enormous variety of dietary compounds to extract nutrients and energy 49. the types and extent of these modifications vary substantially among individuals presumably due to differences in the presence and abundance of gut microbial enzymes and the bioactivities of the resulting metabolites range from beneficial to acutely toxic.

the gut lumen is rich in both host and microbial proteases and studies increasingly indicate that differential microbial proteolytic activity may directly contribute to human disease.

when evaluating the safety of these compounds it is thus crucial to consider the consequences of gut microbial metabolism.here we discuss several types of chemicals that have been implicated in human disease risk and for which there is evidence that gut microbial metabolism affects toxicity.chemicals used in industrial manufacturinggut microbes reductively metabolize azo compounds some of the first industrially important synthetic chemicals 40. despite their use for 150 years as textile dyes food colorings and pharmaceuticals we have an incomplete understanding of the organisms and enzymes that process these molecules.

for example although microbial transformation of azo food dyes generates metabolites that are considered to be non-toxic 34 78 workers with long-term exposure to textile dyes have an increased risk of bladder cancers 79. feeding azo textile dyes to conventional but not gf mice leads to the accumulation of the mutagenic bis-aniline benzidine in urine which implicates microbial metabolism in increasing carcinogen exposure 80. thus the toxic effects of azo compounds may depend both on the individual dye backbone and on the presence of specific metabolizing organisms.koppel et al.page 10gut microbes also metabolize the s-triazine compound melamine an industrial chemical used in the production of various plastics enhancing its toxicity in humans.

elucidating how gut microbes process these compounds may contribute significantly to our fundamental understanding of their effects.gut microbial biotransformation comes of age recent case studiesattempts to decipher the biological consequences of gut microbial xenobiotic metabolism have been hindered by our poor understanding of these transformations.

abundance and distribution in the gut microbiome and host health status including exposure to xenobiotics 16 124.harnessing knowledge of microbial metabolism to improve human healthdeciphering how gut microbial transformation of xenobiotics affects host health will require the integration of clinical studies with mechanistic experiments in model systems and organisms fig.
