By combining disciplines of microbiology organic bioelectronics and electrochemistry we generate redox active surfaces and we study the effect of the electrochemical state on S. Typhimurium biofilm formation.RESULTSDoped PEDOT surfaces for active redox controlTo create surfaces capable of changing their redox state we fabricated thin layers of the conducting polymer PEDOT.

Taken together presented data indicate that PEDOT-based conducting polymer systems are compatible with standard microbiological techniques.Whereas bacterial adhesion to biotic surfaces often is mediated by fimbriae binding to defined receptors initial bacterial interaction with abiotic surfaces is mainly dictated by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.

Since the end result in both cases is electrochemical reduction of the polymer it explains why the externally reduced and unswitched PEDOT provide similarly low support to biofilm formation.To assess the biofilm-supporting and biofilm-reducing capacity of the electroactive PEDOT surfaces in relation to the biofilm support of conventional polyester we next analyzed the amount of biofilm formed on rectangular pieces of polyester mounted vertically in wells of the 12-well device.

As the electrochemical states remain throughout the time given for colonization of the surfaces our two-electrode set-up represents a defined system permitting the study of biofilm formation on both oxidized and reduced electrodes of one bacterial culture in a single well.In one row of the device representing one experiment three wells were prepared with PEDOT composites two wells were used for redox switching one well was left without electrical addres- sing.

This observation implies that the redox states of electroactive PEDOT surfaces can be tuned to selectively support or inhibit bacterial biofilm formation.

In contrast antifouling achieved by reduced PEDOT surfaces with a high electron density and a low ability to accept electrons from respiring cells can be useful to prevent bacterial growth on a variety of objects in the health care sector as well as in industries such as food processing and paper manufacturing.

Typhimurium to form biofilm on the polymer surfaces bacterial cultures were added to the device.

This leads us to conclude that reduced and unswitched PEDOT present electrochemical states that actively counteract the biofilm forming capacity of Salmonella.DISCUSSIONRedox activities are known as hallmarks of biofilm formation with numerous recent studies highlighting the complexity of inter- bacterial redox signaling within the extracellular matrix-as well as the direct or indirect electron transfer to the solid electrodes during bacterial respiration.

The two-electrode conducting polymer electrochemical cell was preferred over a traditional three-electrode setup with a reference electrode and a non-reactive auxiliary electrode as it allowed us to study the relative differences between bacterial colonization at the oxidized and reduced electrodes in the same bacterial culture.

In addition to the electrochemical state of the polymer its electrical conductivity its color and even the exposure of chemical groups among others can be tuned in real-time by applying an external low-volt signal to the conjugated polymer electrode.- Thiophene-based polymers like poly34-ethylenedioxythio- phene PEDOT Fig.
