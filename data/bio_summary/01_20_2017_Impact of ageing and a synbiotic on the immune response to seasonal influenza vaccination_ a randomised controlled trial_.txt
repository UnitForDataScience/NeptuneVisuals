In the current study intervention with the synbiotic did not alter B or T cellphenotype in either young or older subjects prior to vaccination but following vaccination numbers of IgGth memory B cells tended to increase more in the older subjects receiving the synbiotic than those receiving the placebo and numbers of CD25high total and helper T cells increased more in the older subjects who received the synbiotic than those receiving placebo.

This paper demonstrates that aspects of the humoral response to vaccination are markedly influenced by ageing but resistant to manipulation by pre- and pro- biotics.ConclusionIn conclusion while vaccination altered the B and T cell profile differentially in young and older subjects antigen-specific B and T cell activation following an in vitro recall challenge with the influ- enza vaccine was not altered by a synbiotic in either young or older subjects.Conflict of interestPY CC KT ST and MG were involved in the conception and design of the study SE AP-K CC CM and LC were involved in the acquisition analysis and interpretation of the data PY led the preparation of the manuscript with input from all authors.

Other B and T cell subsets were not influenced by CMV seropositivity.Effect of the synbiotic on responsiveness of B and T cells to in vitro re-stimulation with influenza vaccineThere were no significant effects of the synbiotic on the responsiveness of either B cells or T cells to re-stimulation with influenza vaccine which suggests that overall there was no effect of treatment on antigen recall data not shown.DiscussionInfluenza vaccination increased numbers of key B cell subsets in young subjects but failed to do so in older subjects and this had a significant impact on seroconversion.

When the effect of time was examined separately in the young cohort there were significant effects of vaccination in all T cell subsets P  0.01 at least but this was not the case in the older cohort.Influence of CMV status on responsiveness of naive B cells and cytotoxic T cells to in vitro re-stimulation with the influenza vaccine49 of young and 53 of older subjects were seropositive for CMV with no significant difference between age groups.

This is consistent with the suggestion of an association between the proportion of circulating class-switched B cells prior to influenza vaccination and the antibody response after vaccination .In the current study although seroconversion was less consis-tently associated with T cell phenotype high levels of CD26th Th1memory cells prior to vaccination were related to an impaired antibody response to Brisbane in addition to the CD28 CD57th senescent T cells reported in our previous paper .
