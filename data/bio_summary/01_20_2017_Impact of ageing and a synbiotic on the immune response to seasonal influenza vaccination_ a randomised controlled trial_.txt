interestingly cmv seropositivity was associated with significantly lower responsiveness to the vaccine in older subjects only this is relevant because latent infection with cmv has been demonstrated to result in a poor response to infection and vaccination .we previously demonstrated that intervention with a novelsynbiotic b. longum gl-os failed to reverse the impairment in the antibody response to influenza vaccination in older subjects.

this paper demonstrates that aspects of the humoral response to vaccination are markedly influenced by ageing but resistant to manipulation by pre- and pro- biotics.conclusionin conclusion while vaccination altered the b and t cell profile differentially in young and older subjects antigen-specific b and t cell activation following an in vitro recall challenge with the influ- enza vaccine was not altered by a synbiotic in either young or older subjects.conflict of interestpy cc kt st and mg were involved in the conception and design of the study se ap-k cc cm and lc were involved in the acquisition analysis and interpretation of the data py led the preparation of the manuscript with input from all authors.

we recently reported that although a pre- and probiotic combination failed to reverse a marked impairment of the antibody response to influenza vaccination in older subjects it did tend to improve production of vaccine-specific igm and igg in young subjects but not older subjects suggesting an age-dependent response to the intervention .

when the effect of time was examined separately in the young cohort there were significant effects of vaccination in all t cell subsets p  0.01 at least but this was not the case in the older cohort.influence of cmv status on responsiveness of naive b cells and cytotoxic t cells to in vitro re-stimulation with the influenza vaccine49 of young and 53 of older subjects were seropositive for cmv with no significant difference between age groups.

in young subjects cmv seropositivity had no influence on responsiveness of either naive b cells or cytotoxic t cells to in vitro re-stimulation with the vaccine a. however in older subjects cmv seropositivity was associated with signifi- cantly lower responsiveness to the vaccine in these subsets b. other b and t cell subsets were not influenced by cmv seropositivity.effect of the synbiotic on responsiveness of b and t cells to in vitro re-stimulation with influenza vaccinethere were no significant effects of the synbiotic on the responsiveness of either b cells or t cells to re-stimulation with influenza vaccine which suggests that overall there was no effect of treatment on antigen recall data not shown.discussioninfluenza vaccination increased numbers of key b cell subsets in young subjects but failed to do so in older subjects and this had a significant impact on seroconversion.

there was no significant effect of vaccination time on t cell subsets .b and t cell phenotype influences seroconversionseroconverters to the h1n1 subunit in the older cohort had significantly higher post vaccination numbers of plasma b cells  independent t-test.

furthermore impaired responsiveness in older subjects was associated with low antibody production in response to vaccination which suggests that in vitro responsiveness of b cells to the influenza vaccine may be a useful functional marker of the immune response to vaccination.
