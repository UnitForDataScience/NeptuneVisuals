hmos are not digested by thebreastfeeding and intestinal microbial resilience9human gut and therefore the role of intestinal microbiota is crucial for their hydrolysis.in this way hmos increase the population of beneficial bacteria by both probiotic and prebiotic effects and consequently the intestinal microbiota of infants is dominated by bifidobacterium and lactobacillus.the introduction of solid food in children's diet provides a great change in intestinal microbiota diversity.at the end of the 6th month of age all children had a diverse solid food diet which included meat grains rice beans peas and lentils wheat flour fiber greens fruits milk for- mula andor breast milk and yogurt.the dgge patterns of the children studied showed an increase in bands suggest- ing also an increase in microbiota diversity.

the individual results revealed an increase in bands over the months indicating an increase in microbiota diver- sity and complexity and in inter-individual differences in dgge profiles without a unique pattern seen for all chil- dren.however the pcr-dgge profile of each child revealed an interesting pattern of similarity between time points for those who were on exclusive breastfeeding or predomi- nant breastfeeding the microbiota profile of those children showed a persistence of prominent bands even after weaning andor introduction of solid food and also a gradual increase in the number of bands over time sug- gesting an ecological succession.

the permanova analysis comparing exclusive and complementary breastfeeding revealed signif- icant differences between these groups p  0.004 adjusted p-critical  0.005. according to this result the microbial community of each breastfeeding group is different at a 95 confidence level.exclusive breastfeedingthe dgge profile of children under exclusive breastfeeding showed a microbial profile characterized by a stable pattern of bands with common bands during the study time with a slight increase or decrease in intensity ---d evenduring the influence of external factors such the introduc- tion of solid food or antibiotic administration.

este e' um artigo open access sob uma licenca cc by-nc-nd  .introductionthe intestinal microbiota is an important key in health and disease.it is well known that the intestinal microbiota com- positions of newborns and children are influenced by birth dietgeographic region and environmental influences.new methods in 16s rrna sequencingare rewriting the understanding about the relationship between bacteria and human host and the use of these methods for characteriz- ing the intestinal microbiota of infants and children living in developed countries has received increasing attention.

however none of these studies were able to associate specific profiles or changes in microbiota composition with exclusive breast feeding.using dgge the intestinal microbial community struc- ture during the first year of life of the children studied was determined and the results suggested the resilience of the intestinal microbiota pattern to external forces here repre- sented by antibiotic administration and the introduction of solid food.

the effects of antibiotics on the microbiota did not allow new bacteria from foods or the prebiotic effects of foods to produce microbiota changes from the 6th to 10th month of life.in the previous studies enrolling this group of brazil- ian childrenthe authors showed a notable absence ofstaphylococcus as intestinal colonizerand an abundance of e. colicorroborating the worldwide knowledge of the importance of the influence of external factors in intestinal microbiota colonization.

this child had less to eat due to socioeconomic factors and the mother replaced food with breast milk which could explain the decrease in microbial diversity and the maintenance of microbiota resilience.the microbial profile of child 17 demonstrated a fluctu- ation in bands and appeared to give rise to a microbiota with a new profile although it grouped with the other samples sharing the same bands suggesting microbiota resilience.

samples were transported all the way to the laboratory in an ice-filled polystyrene container num- bered table 1s --- supplementary material and immediately stored at 80 c until dna extraction performed in two to three weeks after the collection.breastfeeding practicesthe children enrolled in this study were characterized according to feeding practices based on who indicators for assessing breastfeeding practicesas follows exclusive breastfeeding for those children who received only breast milk predominant breastfeeding for those who received breast milk water and water based drinks and fruit juice and complementary feeding for those who received breast milk and any food including non-human milk also according to the who indicatorsthe time recommended for exclusive breastfeeding was up to the 6th month of age.dna extractiondna was extracted from stools using stool qiamp dna mini kit qiagenr ca usa according to the manufacturer's instructions.

however information about how the microbial community structure changes in the short term due to external factors was missing.denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge has demonstrated that the dynamics of the diversity in the intestinal microbial community can be assessed to determine microbial structural differences between environmentsand their changes over time.the present study analyzed the microbial community structure of this group of children monthly during their first year of life using dgge.material and methodssubjects and samplesa group of 11 children living at a low socioeconomic level was analyzed as previously described.the infants were vagi- nally delivered at the university hospital of the university of sao paulo hu-usp.

of pages 102carvalho-ramos ii et al.conclusion these results suggested an intestinal microbiota pattern resilient to external forces due to the probiotic and prebiotic effects of exclusive breastfeeding reinforcing the importance of exclusive breastfeeding until the 6th month of life.c 2017 sociedade brasileira de pediatria.

if abun- dance was reduced by a disturbance some bacteria groupmay benefit from the new conditions and then increase in abundance restoring the original composition.the analysis of dgge results of this group of children revealed an interesting profile of microbiota community resilience in children fed exclusively with breast milk supported by the permanova analysis in which the micro- biota profile was different from those under complementary feeding p  0.005. children 12 13 14 and 17 were on exclusive breastfeeding up to the 6th month of life and after the introduction of solid food andor antibiotic administra- tion an increase in band number was noted suggesting an8carvalho-ramos ii et al.bchild 01child 02fig.

on the other hand the analysis of the individual's profile allowed a clearer interpretation of intestinal microbial community structure showing an increase in bands over the months indicating an increase in microbiota diversity and complexity as pre- viously discussed.bacterial resilience was described as the rate at which microbial composition returns to its original composition after being disturbed due to physiological features and adaptation mechanisms in the new environment.

this profile was also noticed in the ca which indicated the change in microbial community structure after the 5th month of age a.complementary feedingthe dgge profiles observed for the children not on exclu- sive breastfeeding showed a fluctuation in bands without a restoration of the initial microbial pattern.

for those who received antibiotics the number of the bands in the dgge profile decreased during the antibi- otic administration time  and an increase in bands was observed in subsequent months but with a different microbial community.

in children with complementary feeding the dgge profile showed a fluctu- ation in bands during the time studied and also no sharing of common bands according to ca corroborating the dgge results.
