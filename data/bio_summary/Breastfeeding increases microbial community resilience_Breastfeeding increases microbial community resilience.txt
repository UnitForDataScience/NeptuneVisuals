The individual results revealed an increase in bands over the months indicating an increase in microbiota diver- sity and complexity and in inter-individual differences in DGGE profiles without a unique pattern seen for all chil- dren.However the PCR-DGGE profile of each child revealed an interesting pattern of similarity between time points for those who were on exclusive breastfeeding or predomi- nant breastfeeding The microbiota profile of those children showed a persistence of prominent bands even after weaning andor introduction of solid food and also a gradual increase in the number of bands over time sug- gesting an ecological succession.

According to this result the microbial community of each breastfeeding group is different at a 95 confidence level.Exclusive breastfeedingThe DGGE profile of children under exclusive breastfeeding showed a microbial profile characterized by a stable pattern of bands with common bands during the study time with a slight increase or decrease in intensity ---D evenduring the influence of external factors such the introduc- tion of solid food or antibiotic administration.

HMOs are not digested by theBreastfeeding and intestinal microbial resilience9human gut and therefore the role of intestinal microbiota is crucial for their hydrolysis.In this way HMOs increase the population of beneficial bacteria by both probiotic and prebiotic effects and consequently the intestinal microbiota of infants is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.The introduction of solid food in children's diet provides a great change in intestinal microbiota diversity.At the end of the 6th month of age all children had a diverse solid food diet which included meat grains rice beans peas and lentils wheat flour fiber greens fruits milk for- mula andor breast milk and yogurt.The DGGE patterns of the children studied showed an increase in bands suggest- ing also an increase in microbiota diversity.

This profile was also noticed in the CA which indicated the change in microbial community structure after the 5th month of age A.Complementary feedingThe DGGE profiles observed for the children not on exclu- sive breastfeeding showed a fluctuation in bands without a restoration of the initial microbial pattern.

However information about how the microbial community structure changes in the short term due to external factors was missing.Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE has demonstrated that the dynamics of the diversity in the intestinal microbial community can be assessed to determine microbial structural differences between environmentsand their changes over time.The present study analyzed the microbial community structure of this group of children monthly during their first year of life using DGGE.Material and methodsSubjects and samplesA group of 11 children living at a low socioeconomic level was analyzed as previously described.The infants were vagi- nally delivered at the University Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo HU-USP.

For those who received antibiotics the number of the bands in the DGGE profile decreased during the antibi- otic administration time  and an increase in bands was observed in subsequent months but with a different microbial community.

In children with complementary feeding the DGGE profile showed a fluctu- ation in bands during the time studied and also no sharing of common bands according to CA corroborating the DGGE results.

The mothers were instructedBreastfeeding and intestinal microbial resilience3Table 1Clinical information on antibiotic use and breastfeeding practices.Modified from Taddei et al.a According to World Health Organization indicators for assessing breastfeeding practices.to collect the fecal sample immediately after elimination with a standardized sterile spoon place it in a sterile plastic container and keep it in a freezer  20 C until the appoint- ment some hours later.

The dendrogram analysis did not show any correla- tion between clustering profile and breastfeeding practice since there were inter-individual differences between theBreastfeeding and intestinal microbial resilience7AChild 03Child 122-23-24-3-4PC1 21.14Fig.

There was an increase in bands over time in a bigger proportion of the profile compared to breastfeeding children however the microbial community structure was not preserved and no pattern could be identified.
