That is evident in host mechanisms that do not simply exclude all mi- crobes from the environmentally exposed host surfaces but finely regulate the associated bacterial communities.56This can also be observed for the host Hydra where the associated microbiome is not a random assemblage of bacteria from the environ- ment but a very specific community despite the fact that the polyps are in continuous close contact with the surrounding bacterioplank- ton.414244 From the available pool bacteria are selectively recruited depending on not only host immunity and genetic background4244 but also on the interactions between the co-occurring microbes host physiology and the specific environmental conditions.5758 Evidence has accumulated that hosts should be viewed as ecosystem engineers that manipulate general system-wide properties of microbial commu- nities to their benefit.59  Microbial colonization of HydraBefore colonization microbes must reach a host's surface likely through diffusive or convective passage and active swimming.60 In a recent article Tout et al.61 suggest that motility and chemotaxis are important bacterial traits for the establishment of specific coral- bacterial interactions.

Such a colonization of a preferred surface microenvironment is known from biofilms where bacteria respond to very distinct environmental sig- nals enabling them to occupy their specific niche.63A critical step in the process of colonization is the adhesion to a surface which can either be reversible or irreversible.64 It is postulated that the colonization potential of a bacterium on various substrates can be described by its secretome which includes both the secre- tion systems and their protein substrates.64 This concept offers not only a lot of potential in terms of investigating colonization factors in the context of infection but also in determining their involvement in the colonization of host species by their specific microbiota.64 It is however unlikely that hosts are merely passive bystanders in the col- onization process as there is selection on hosts for managing their mi- crobiome.65 The role of host factors in regulating microbial adhesion at epithelial surfaces has recently been addressed by McLoughlin et al.66 Using an individual-based modeling approach they predict that the host changes the competitive potential of particular microbes and can also create refugia for slow-growing species.

In Hydra host tissue integrity and multicellular organization are defended by both an elaborate innate immune response21 and phagocytic pro- cesses2223 which together form a robust and critical system through which self is distinguished from non-self pathogenic signals are rec- ognized and eliminated and host tissue homeostasis is maintained.

In addition interspecies interactions between the host and its stable microbiome interactions between photosynthetic algae and their host cells as well as interactions within the microbial community24 are fur- ther important components of the Hydra metaorganism.

Whether this result is due to host secretionshost-epithelial feeding host immunity or a combination of all is cur- rently being investigated.Hydra can reproduce either asexually or sexually.

One explanation for this could be that this is a stage where the host does not possess any control and it thus func- tions as a passive settling substrate for the bacteria.48 Alternatively the host could also actively promote growth and attachment of a very specific bacterial community by host-epithelial feeding spike and cu- ticle stage are characterized by an additional outer matrix.

This can happen via bacte- rial capsular polysaccharides or appendages such as pili and fimbrae with which bacteria can either directly attach to the host tissue its extracellular proteins or other microbes with which they form bio- films.73 Resources for bacterial survival and reproduction either stem from the surrounding environment the host or from other neighbor- ing microbes for possible metabolic interactions between microbes see Box 2.

With the help of a theoretical model the cause of the observed microbial colonization pattern was predicted to likely be caused by both host factors such as the innate immune system and frequency-dependent bacteria-bacteria interactions.71 The host immune response is thought to reduce the fluctuations in bacterial community dynamics whereas the composition of a stable microbi- ome seems to depend upon initial colonization of one later the most abundant community member.71These results are in line with more general predictions where one or few keystone species are founders of the community anddetermine the ultimate composition and function of eg the human gut microbiome.

Concerning interactions within the bacterial microbiome testing the aspects leading to stability is of great importance as also pointed out by Fischbach and Segre.56 We are certain that the Hydra model will make a useful contribution in understanding host-associated microbial communities as we are currently collecting data on the strength and nature of the ecological interactions between its different microbial species Figure 1.Another factor facilitating the stability of its microbiome is the host itself.59 Several mechanisms have been identified by which a host may be able to suppress the positive feedback between cooperating species and weaken their interaction.

Host-virus interactionIn the same way host has evolved to control viral infections viruses have developed a variety of different mechanisms to manipulate their host.
