2016b to test for treatment effect and the interaction between treatment and day over the treatment period.

An interaction between treatment and sampling day was observed for CP starch and sugar intake with greater intake of CP starch and sugar for RAP com- pared with GRAD most notably around 16 d pp.The total VFA concentration was affected by sam-pling day and the treatment and sampling day interac- tion but not by treatment Dieho et al.

Rumen fluid pH was affected by sampling day P  0.01 decreasing from pH 6.72 during the pretreatment period to 6.17 during the treatment pe- riod Figure 1D but rumen fluid pH was not affectedby treatment or the interaction between treatment and sampling day P  0.24.

The unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae tended to be affected by treatment only with numerically higher relative abundances in RAP during the treatment pe- riod 3.6 average compared with GRAD 1.5.Rumen Protozoal and Archaeal Community CompositionRumen protozoal communities were more diverse during the dry period 10 d ap compared with the lactation period 16 and 44 d pp Figure 4.
