the unclassified erysipelotrichaceae tended to be affected by treatment only with numerically higher relative abundances in rap during the treatment pe- riod 3.6 average compared with grad 1.5.rumen protozoal and archaeal community compositionrumen protozoal communities were more diverse during the dry period 10 d ap compared with the lactation period 16 and 44 d pp figure 4. epidinium and ostracodinium were the dominant protozoal genera during the dry period with a relative abundance of40.7 and 21.9 respectively.

the relative abundance of the spirochaetales was low throughout the experiment decreasing from 1.7 during the dry period to 1.4 during the lactation p  0.01. the relative abundance of all other orders of bacteria combined comprised 5.0 and 3.3 of the community during the pretreatment and treatment periods respectively.of the major taxa at the family and genus level table 1 prevotella had the highest relative abundance during the dry period 11.6 increasing p  0.01 to 21.8 during lactation.

the relative abundances of several major taxa were not markedly affected by sampling day notably butyrivibrio 8.0 on average over the experimental period p  0.11 and the unclassified prevotellaceae 4.2 on average p  0.07. for 4 out of 22 major taxa an interaction be- tween treatment and sampling day was observed p  0.01. the relative abundance of oribacterium showed a temporary peak for rap at 16 d pp compared with grad whereas the relative abundances of the unclas- sified ruminococcaceae saccharofermentans and xyl- anibacter were lower in rap compared with grad at 16 d pp.

2016b to test for treatment effect and the interaction between treatment and day over the treatment period.

an interaction between treatment and sampling day was observed for cp starch and sugar intake with greater intake of cp starch and sugar for rap com- pared with grad most notably around 16 d pp.the total vfa concentration was affected by sam-pling day and the treatment and sampling day interac- tion but not by treatment dieho et al.

rumen fluid ph was affected by sampling day p  0.01 decreasing from ph 6.72 during the pretreatment period to 6.17 during the treatment pe- riod figure 1d but rumen fluid ph was not affectedby treatment or the interaction between treatment and sampling day p  0.24. the molar proportion of ace- tic acid decreased from 73 during the dry period to 65 during lactation whereas the molar proportions of propionic and butyric acid increased from 17 and 10 during the dry period to 23 and 12 during lactation respectively.

postpartum an interaction between sampling day and treatment was observed p  0.01. richness was lower for rap at 9 and 16 d pp compared with grad p  0.02. however from 30 d pp onward richness becamesimilar again for rap and grad p  0.12.the bacterial community was dominated by orders clostridiales and bacteroidales throughout the experi- ment table 1 both comprising a relative abundance of approximately 40. the orders clostridiales bac- teroidales fibrobacterales aeromonadales and spiro- chaetales were not affected by treatment or treatmentby day interaction.

only the erysipelotrichales were affected by treatment p  0.03 with a relative abundance of 4.2 in rap averaged over the treatment period com- pared with 1.6 for grad.

2013.despite the clear effect of the concentrate treatment on the richness of the rumen bacterial community at order level only the relative abundance of erysipelot- richales was affected by concentrate treatment.

by 44 d pp no more differences were found in the relative abundance of the protozoal community members between treatments.the relative abundance of the methanobrevibacter gottschalkii 57.8 and methanobrevibacter ruminan- tium 29.8 clades dominated the archaeal commu- nity at 10 d ap figure 4. in contrast to the relative abundance of mbb.

1998. as the concentrate treatment was only applicable to the treatment period custom contrast statements were constructed as described by dieho et al.

briefly dmi approximately doubled from the dry pe- riod to 44 d pp figure 1a and was neither affected by treatment nor was an interaction observed between treatment and sampling day.

samples taken during the treatment period showed less clear grouping regardless of sampling day or treatment.

for all of these taxa an interaction between treatment and sampling day was observed p 0.04. during the dry period no differences were ob- served between the treatment groups.
