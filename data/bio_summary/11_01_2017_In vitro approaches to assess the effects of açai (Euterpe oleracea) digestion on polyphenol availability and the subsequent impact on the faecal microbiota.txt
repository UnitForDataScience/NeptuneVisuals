inclusion of digested acai pulp in the fermentation broth resulted in increased concen- trations of total scfa and of acetic acid at 8 and 24 h p  0.001 propionic acid at 24 h p  0.01 and butyric acid at 24 h p  0.05 relative to control .degradation of polyphenols during digestion and fermentation by human faecal bacteria and their antioxidant capacitymajor phenolic compounds present in acai were identified by hplc samples were taken through the simulated digestion model to follow the degradation of these compounds prior to batchculture fermentation .

filter sterilised samples were prepared from the fermentation broths collected at 0 h of fermentation or follow- ing 24 h of fermentation.

the cells were incubated with the filter ster- ilised batch culture fermentation supernatants of the simulated digestion of acai or with the acai free fermentation as a control 2.5 250 ml for 24 h at 37 degc.

a one-way analysis of variance anova with a tukey post hoc test was conducted to evaluate the changes in microbial populations with time 0 8 and 24 h. p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001. the short chain fatty acid data was analysed using the same approach.an independent samples t-test was used to evaluate comet assay data.resultschanges in bacterial populations with in vitro batch culture fermentationfluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to assess changes in microbial populations following batch fermentation of colonic samples at 0 8 and 24 h of fermentation.

as measured by the folin ciocalteau assay the availability of total phenolics had reduced by 51 follow- ing the digestion of the acai pulp .following dialysis the digested acai was added to fermentation media and fermented in batch cultures using human faecal sam- ples as innocula samples of the fermentation supernatant were collected at 0 8 and 24 h analysed using hplc for individual phe- nolics  and for total phenolics via folin ciocalteau.

batch culture fermentation supernatants with the digested acai did however have a higher total antioxidant capacity than the con- trol fermentation supernatant .

a significant anti-genotoxic effect p  0.05 was observed for the fermentation supernatant containing the digested acai at 0 h with a reduction in dna damage of approximately 31.5 6.66 - 1.2 verses the acai free fermentation supernatant used as a negative control 9.73 - 0.8 tail dna .

as our bacteroides count decreased with thedigested acai and there were no significant differences between the numbers of bifidobacteria in treatment versus control the observed higher concentrations of acetate may reflect the utiliza-table 2phenolic compound metabolism detected by hplc during acai pulp fermentation in ph-controlled batch culture system for 24 h. values are means with standard deviation n  3 and expressed as mgl.compoundsincubation time hours0 h8 h24 hgallic acid0.10 - 0.240.05 - 0.15n.dp-hydroxybenzoic acid2.23 - 0.520.90 - 1.260.035gentisic acid0.26 - 0.68n.dn.dchlorogenic acid1.12 - 0.561.11 - 1.210.45 - 0.65caffeic acid11.2 - 0.759.59n.dsyringic acid0.50 - 0.21n.dn.dferulic acid0.36 - 0.480.27 - 0.250.24 - 0.21quercetin acid0.20 - 0.570.15 - 0.340.13 - 0.41vanillin acid0.46 - 1.320.43 - 0.520.23 - 0.032cyanidin-3-o-glucoside1.20 - 1.2n.dn.dcyanidin-3-o- rutinoside0.40 - 2.10.131 - 1.5n.dtotal phenolic content443.04 - 68.8418.9 - 19.3513.7 - 86.8antioxidant activity frap 225.9 - 13.0333.6 - 80.9373.5 - 41.4mean values - sd of three donors on acai after batch culture fermentation in three different times point 0 h 8 h  24 h.n.d  not detected.

further- more there is no clearance of substrateand or fermentation prod- ucts via the absorptive process as would occur in vivo the build- up of product in the fermentation vessel affects microbial activity and metabolite production.

we investi- gated this hypothesis using a simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of acai pulp and a subsequent ph-controlled anaerobic batch-culture fermentation model reflective of the distal region of the human large intestine.following in vitro digestion 49.8 of the total initial polyphenols were available.

0308-8146c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.this study aimed to elucidate the probable effects of digested acai on the colonic microbiota using a model of the digestive pro- cess involving a simulated oral gastric and then small intestinal digestion the removal of small molecules via dialysis and finally a simulated colonic fermentation in a ph-controlled stirred batch-culture system with human faecal innocula reflecting of the environmental conditions of the distal region of the human large intestine  .

as a secondary outcome measure the fates of the polyphenols pre- sent in the acai through each stage of the process have been fol- lowed along with the anti-genotoxic activity of the fermentation supernatants produced against a cultured colonic cell line.materials and methodschemicalsagarose edta trizma base triton hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hepes and ethidium bromide were purchased from sigma- aldrich ltd. dorset uk.
