Inclusion of digested acai pulp in the fermentation broth resulted in increased concen- trations of total SCFA and of acetic acid at 8 and 24 h P  0.001 propionic acid at 24 h P  0.01 and butyric acid at 24 h P  0.05 relative to control .Degradation of polyphenols during digestion and fermentation by human faecal bacteria and their antioxidant capacityMajor phenolic compounds present in acai were identified by HPLC samples were taken through the simulated digestion model to follow the degradation of these compounds prior to batchculture fermentation .

Filter sterilised samples were prepared from the fermentation broths collected at 0 h of fermentation or follow- ing 24 h of fermentation.

The cells were incubated with the filter ster- ilised batch culture fermentation supernatants of the simulated digestion of acai or with the acai free fermentation as a control 2.5 250 ml for 24 h at 37 degC.

The short chain fatty acid data was analysed using the same approach.An independent samples t-test was used to evaluate comet assay data.ResultsChanges in bacterial populations with in vitro batch culture fermentationFluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to assess changes in microbial populations following batch fermentation of colonic samples at 0 8 and 24 h of fermentation.

The anti-genotoxic effects of fermentation supernatants containing digested acai or a negative control acai free digesta fermentation on HT-29 cells COMET assay.

As measured by the Folin Ciocalteau assay the availability of total phenolics had reduced by 51 follow- ing the digestion of the acai pulp .Following dialysis the digested acai was added to fermentation media and fermented in batch cultures using human faecal sam- ples as innocula samples of the fermentation supernatant were collected at 0 8 and 24 h analysed using HPLC for individual phe- nolics  and for total phenolics via Folin Ciocalteau.

Batch culture fermentation supernatants with the digested acai did however have a higher total antioxidant capacity than the con- trol fermentation supernatant .

A significant anti-genotoxic effect P  0.05 was observed for the fermentation supernatant containing the digested acai at 0 h with a reduction in DNA damage of approximately 31.5 6.66 - 1.2 verses the acai free fermentation supernatant used as a negative control 9.73 - 0.8 tail DNA .

Change from baseline in bacterial phyla as analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation FISH in a batch culture fermentation containing digested acai fruit or a negative control at 8 and 24 h of fermentation.

As our bacteroides count decreased with thedigested acai and there were no significant differences between the numbers of bifidobacteria in treatment versus control the observed higher concentrations of acetate may reflect the utiliza-Table 2Phenolic compound metabolism detected by HPLC during Acai pulp fermentation in pH-controlled batch culture system for 24 h.
