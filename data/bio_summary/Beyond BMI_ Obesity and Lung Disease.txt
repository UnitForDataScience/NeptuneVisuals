The inflammatory factors that areincreased in obese adipose tissue and then enter the circulation include leptin tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-aIL-6 and IL-8C-reactive protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.The numbers of inflammatory cells in adipose tissue are also increased inobesity CD8 and CD4 T-lymphocyte numbers are significantly increased in the adipose tissue of obese humans and miceand CD68 macrophages account for up to 50 of cells in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese individuals.This proinflammatory milieu affects lung disease.

We have found that decreased serum adiponectin levels in obesity correlated positively with markers of TH1 and negatively with markers of TH2 immune response suggesting that perturbations of adipokine levels in obesity could skew the immune response toward a TH1 phenotype.Compared with healthy control subjects and normal-weight patients with asthma obese children also demonstrated evidence of TH1-polarized inflammation that correlated with obesity-mediated inflammatory markers such as leptin and IL-6.However overall we have found evidence of dampened adaptive immune responses in obese humans and in mouse models of obese asthma.

The volume of the chest compartment is invariably decreased in obesity A which lowers the operating volume of the lungs B. Consequently the FRC and the ERV are reduced but all other subdivisions of lung volume are remarkably well preserved C. ERV 14 expiratory reserve volume FRC 14 functional residual capacity IC 14 inspiratory capacity TLC 14 total lung capacity VC 14 vital capacity VT 14 tidal volume.reduced by 10 22 and 33 in overweight mildly obese and severely obese subjects without asthma respectively.

Forno et alshowed that obese children had evidence of dysanapsis a dissociation of lung airway growth with lung size that may be contributing to lung disease in obese children.

Conversely mice deficient in adiponectin develop airway eosinophilia and airway inflammationcoupled with increased vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertensionas well as an emphysema phenotype with increased alveolar macrophage TNF-a expression.A role for obesity-associated adiponectin deficiency has also been suggested in the pathogenesis of ARDS a condition for which the obese are at increased risklikely from pulmonary vascular priming due to impaired endothelial function.These data suggest arole for adiponectin in normal lung function they also suggest that adiponectin deficiency may contribute to diseases of the pulmonary airways parenchyma and vasculature.Circulating levels of certain key inflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissues are increased in obesity.One example is TNF-a which may have importantimplications for lung disease in obesity as we have shown that constitutive overexpression of TNF-a in normal-weight mice leads to the development of a combination of both emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.Furthermore Williams et alfound that TNF-a is involved in airway responses to ozone in obese mice by augmenting airway neutrophilic inflammation while blunting airway reactivity.

The obese state is associated with changes in the gut microbiome cellular metabolism lipid handling immune function insulin resistance and circulating factors produced by adipose tissue.

More than one-third of the US adult population is obese and another one-third is overweightbut most troubling is that 32 of US children and adolescents are either overweight or obese.Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of a number of respiratory diseases including asthma pulmonary hypertension sleep apnea obesity hypoventilation syndrome pneumonia and ARDSand it complicates the pathogenesis of other diseases such as COPD.

The mechanical effects ofobesity are also reflected in significant decrements in the compliance of the lungs chest wall and entire respiratory systemwhich likely contribute to therespiratory symptoms experienced by many obese people.Long-term obesity may also affect lung growth.

Nevertheless not all obese people develop lung disease.
