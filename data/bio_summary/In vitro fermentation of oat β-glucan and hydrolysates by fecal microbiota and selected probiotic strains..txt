similar results were obtained with barley -glucan hydrolysates by supporting the growth of probiotics lactobacil- lus casei and bifidobacterium animalis in a comparative study reported by su et al.5 the results of the present study were in contrast to studies conducted by jaskari et al.26 who found that low-molecular-mass hydrolysis products of oat -glucan failed to further promote the growth of the bifidobacterium strain duringa2.22.01.81.61.41.21.00.80.60.40.2g ogh nc01020304050timehc4.0b3.02.52.01.51.00.50.0g ogh nc01020304050timeh3.53.0g ogh nc2.52.01.51.00.50.001020304050timehfigure 2. growth responses of a lr389 b lgg and c bb536 in mrs broth supplemented with ogh as the sole carbon source.

the present study aimed to evaluate the prebiotic potential of raw and hydrolyzed oat -glucan during in vitro fermentation by fecal microbiota and selected probiotic strains.results the results obtained showed that both oat -glucan og and hydrolysates ogh comparably promoted the growth of fecal lactobacillus counts p  0.05. importantly ogh revealed greater fermentability compared to og as denoted by lower ph value and higher short-chain fatty acid concentration p  0.05. moreover ogh was found to be more favorable to provide growth substrates for lactobacillus helveticus r389 lr389 lactobacillus rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 lgg and bifidobacterium longum bb536 bb536 than og and was preferentially utilized by lr389 lgg and bb536 as the sole carbon source.conclusion the results of the present study indicate that oat -glucan hydrolysates could serve as a more promising material for developing novel symbiotic foods.c 2017 society of chemical industrykeywords in vitro fermentation molecular weight oat -glucan hydrolysates prebiotocs probioticsintroductionit has been generally accepted that the gut microbiota imbalance is strongly associated with the onset and progression of chronic nutrition overload-induced metabolic diseases such as obesity type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.1 multiple mech- anisms including an increase in pro-inflammatory substances synthesis and a reduction in short chain fatty acid scfa produc- tion have contributed to explaining the link between impaired gut homeostasis and obesity-related metabolic dysfunction.2 accumulated evidence has demonstrated that the administration of prebiotics or probiotics alleviated the metabolic disturbance by remodeling the gut microbial composition and improving the gut barrier integrity.3 therefore it is imperative to explore specific prebiotics and probiotics as well as their combination synbiotics for the early intervention of obesity-related metabolic disorders.oat -glucan a non-starch polysaccharide has been recognized as a potential source of prebiotics.4 oat -glucan selectively stim- ulated the growth of beneficial indigenous microflora resident in the intestine by providing a fermentable carbon source.5 more-over oat -glucan potentially controlled body weight lowered serum cholesterol levels and improved postprandial glycemia.6 - 8 the remodeling of the gut microbiota composition and an increasein scfa production from substrate fermentation partly explained the beneficial action of oat -glucan.49 however an increasing number of studies have suggested that the molecular weight mw of oat -glucan was strictly related to its bioactivities including in vitro bile acid binding and fermentation energy expendituregastric emptying and glycemic control cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant and inflammation-resolving effects.10 - 15 neverthe- less these findings of recent research on the effects of oat -glucanfractions on its physiological functions were inconsistent espe- cially the prebiotic response of oat -glucan with differing mw.the favorable effects of probiotics in health maintenance anddisease prevention have been defined as a result of human ani- mal and in vitro microbial culture studies as reviewed by quigley.16 recently the application of probiotic strains as therapeutic sup- plements has attracted much attention.17 the research aimed to develop functional probiotic foods capable of maintaining the viability of probiotics in foods.

notably ogh treatment resulted in higher levels of acetate and propionate production than og after incubation for 24 h p  0.05. moreover both og and ogh comparably induced changes in the scfa patterns acetate propionate butyrate compared to the control group 622315 versus 642412 versus 692110 for the og ogh and control groups respectively in a statistically signifi- cant level.

these data suggested that ogh could be preferentially utilized and might have better prebiotic effect than og.effects of og and ogh on the lactobacillus population duringin vitro fermentationit was generally recognized that the variations in amounts and pro- files of scfa were concurrent with changes in bacterial communityfigure 1. changes in ph value during in vitro fermentation of og and ogh by rat fecal microbiota.

to fur- ther explore the divergent changes in scfa induced by og and ogh a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the lactobacillus population in fecal samples during in vitro fer- mentation should be conducted in our future study.effects of og and ogh on the growth of four selected probiotic strains in mrs basal brothbased on the present study and previous studies showing that oat -glucan promoted the growth of indigenous gut microflora during in vitro fermentation22 the effects of og and ogh on the growth of four selected commercial probiotics were eval- uated.
