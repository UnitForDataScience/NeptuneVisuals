Since B cells are very potent professional antigen-presenting cells the deple- tion of such cells leads also to reduced presentation of antigens to T cells   .

Increased numbers of T cells recognizing multiple myelin basic protein epitopes in multiple sclerosis.

B cells have an important role by amplifying the immune response of T cells by capturing antigen with their surface immunoglobulin and presenting it to T cells.

Myelin-specific T cells also recognize neuronal autoantigen in a transgenic mouse model of multiple sclerosis.

Antibodies secreted by plasma cells that have differentiated from B cells are highly structure specific and can have important effector functions leading to functional impairment orand lesion evolvement.

In paraneoplastic diseases of the CNS epitopes from a neo- plasm are exposed on antigen-presenting cells to T cells which subsequently also recognize an epitope of similar structural appearance in the CNS .Importantly the T and B cell epitopes can differ depending on antigen processing in autoimmune disease and possibly also paraneoplastic disease  .
