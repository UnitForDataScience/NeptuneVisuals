Experiments that cohouse one or both sexes without sexual contact and that explicitly manipulate fecal exposure are required to test whether non-sexual social interactions could also elicit the response of the gut microbiome we observed.Changes in host physiology in response to social interaction or lack thereof could also explain shifts in microbiome structure.

Protein supple- mentation also did not affect the gut microbiome in decorated crickets suggesting that insensitivity of gut microbes to dietary protein could contribute to the lack of an effect of nuptial gift consumption.

Hormones that regulate appetite energy expenditure and metabolism are thought to affect the gut microbiome by altering immune function mucous production in the gut epithelia and food intake Spor et al.

Central Avenue Sidney MT 59270 USASummaryMating is a ubiquitous social interaction with the potential to influence the microbiome by facilitating transmission modifying host physiology and in spe- cies where males donate nuptial gifts to females altering diet.

We manipulated mating and nuptial gift consumption in two insects that differ in nuptial gift size the Mormon cricket Anabrus simplex and the decorated cricket Gryllodes sigillatus with the expec- tation that larger gifts are more likely to affect the gut microbiome.

Our study provides experimental evidence that sexual interactions can affect the microbiome and suggests mating can promote beneficial gut bacteria.Received 21 August 2016 accepted 27 October 2016.

Which of these two explana- tions is correct is likely to have important implications for how nuptial gifts influence the microbiome as protein intake can induce rapid changes in the gut microbial com- munities Wu et al.

2014.We manipulated nuptial feeding and mating to measure their effects on the gut microbiome in two insects that dif- fer in the size of their gifts the Mormon cricket Anabrus simplex Orthoptera Tettiginiidae and the decorated cricket Gryllodes sigillatus Orthoptera Gryllidae.

We assessed these alternatives by screening male and female reproductive tissues for bacteria and measuring components of the immune system that are known to change in response to mating in insects.Results and DiscussionMating and the microbiomeWe found that mating but not spermatophylax consumption influenced the structure of the gut microbiome of Mormon crickets Fig.

2000.Nuptial gift consumption and the microbiomeIn contrast to our expectation that larger nuptial gifts should elicit a greater change in microbiome composi- tion spermatophylax consumption did not affect the gut bacterial communities in either species Table 1 and Table S1 Supporting Information.
