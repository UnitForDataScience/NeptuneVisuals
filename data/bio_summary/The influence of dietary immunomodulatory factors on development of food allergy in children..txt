Studies conducted in 2007 in Italy on 187 kindergarten children with asthma and allergic rhinitis revealed a positive correlation with longer remission pe- riods in those children who consumed milk with Lactoba- cillus casei rather than in those who were administered placebo 37.

He discovered that children of those women less frequently developed IgE-dependent eczema than children from the control group 82.

revealed that a diet rich in omega-3 acids ap- plied in asthmatic children reduces the severity of the disease 84 although in his study he included children whose exposure to inhaled allergens and applied diet was closely controlled.

Results of GABRIELA or PARSIFAL studies unambiguously indicate that the risk of atopy or asthma in later life was much lower in chil- dren exposed to environmental microorganisms than in children who were raised in cities 23 24.DietA diet is another factor which is becoming more and more crucial for development of allergic diseases.

observed that supple- mentation with Lactobacillus GG in pregnant women and infants did not result in a decreased number of atopic cases and episodes of allergic exacerbation in children.

Due to different results of the application of N-3 PUFA in pregnant women and later in their children we should conduct further studies in order to evaluate their potential protective properties for allergic diseases 86 87.Short-chain fatty acidsThe SCFAs are divided to exogenous and endogenous ones.
