Exogenous integrin b8 rescues vascular defects in ric8a mutantsSee also Figure S7.A-D Exogenous GFP has no obvious effects on vessel morphology in wildtype striata A and does not rescue defects in ric8a mutants B. Exogenous integrin b8 also has no effects on wildtype striata C but rescues mutant defects D. Note absence of glomeruloid structures in D in comparison to B arrows.E-H Exogenous GFP has no obvious effects on apoptosis arrows in wildtype striata E and does not rescue apoptosis in ric8a mutants F. Exogenous integrin b8 also has no effects on wildtype striata G but suppresses apoptosis in mutants H.Quantification of glomeruloid areas shows near complete suppression by b8 expression in ric8a mutants.

Thus ric8a mutation results in severe loss of integrin b8 expression in GM neural progenitors which may in turn lead to compromised TGFb signaling and defective vessel development.Ma et al.Page 7To further evaluate effects of ric8a mutation we examined b8 mRNA levels in neurospheres derived from the embryonic neocortex and medial ganglion eminence MGE.

ric8a mutation likely results in primary defects in GM angiogenesis which in turn leads to secondary defects such as cell death and gliosis.ric8a mutation results in compromised integrin b8 expression and TGFb signalingThe vascular phenotypes are reminiscent of those in mice mutant for integrin av and b8 McCarty et al.

Thus these results indicate that ric8a mutation results in a specific loss of integrin b8 expression from GM but not other regional neural progenitors.Studies have shown that p38 MAPK pathway is essential for b8 expression in cultured cells Markovics et al.

Thus these results further implicate the neural progenitor S1P pathway in regulating GM angiogenesis and identify a drug for potential tissue-specific GM hemorrhage intervention.Exogenous integrin b8 rescues ric8a mutant vascular defectsOur results above also strongly indicate that integrin b8 is a key mediator of brain S1P regulation of GM angiogenesis.

Thus Ric8a is specifically required for p38 activation in GM neural progenitors and may regulate integrin b8 through p38 MAPK.S1P regulates integrin b8 via Ric8a and p38 in GM neural progenitorsRic8a is an essential co-factor for several classes of Ga proteins Gabay et al.

Thus S1PR1-3 likely all contribute to b8 regulation in GM NPCs while distinct wiring of other intracellular signaling andor transcriptional regulators may play a significant role in regional specificity.S1PR1 and Ric8a act in the same pathway to regulate GM angiogenesis in vivoOur in vitro results strongly suggest that the S1PR-Ric8a pathway regulates integrin b8 and TGFb signaling during GM angiogenesis.

In vitro we found anisomycin also dramatically elevate b8 mRNA in wildtype neurospheres control 100 - 10 treated 349 - 44 p  0.01 n  4.Importantly it similarly elevated b8 in mutant neurospheres by close to 5 folds Fig.
