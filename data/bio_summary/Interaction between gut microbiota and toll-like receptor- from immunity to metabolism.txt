for example the first contact of gut microbiota with the intestinal lining triggers the acti- vation of tlr5 in epithelial cells and dendritic cells resulting in the recruitment of b cells and t cells and subsequently the production of iga to limit the overcolonization of gut microbiota .

the evalu- ation of metabolic and immunological capacities of tlrs in different metabolic cells using cell-specific knockout models along with in vitro studies would give us insight on generation of specific tlr agonists or antagonists for different diseases  .interaction between gut microbiota and tlrs possible intercellular energy relocationthe commensal microbes reside throughout our bodies including the skin oral cavity and gut and the human gut contains 1014 bacteria which outnumber the total number of cells in all physiological compartments.

assuming that sensitivity of tlrs is different in immune cells and metabolic cells it is possible that the tlrs in the meta- bolic cells are more sensitive to the gut microbiota-derived endotoxemia thereby metabolic alteration would be engaged first.

a thorough investigation on the functions of the tlr pathway and the interaction between tlrs and gut microbiota will allow us to better evaluate on the clinical application of agonismantagonism of tlrs in chronic diseases.open access this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license http creativecommons.orglicensesby4.0 which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.referencechassaing b ley re gewirtz at 2014 intestinal epithelial cell toll-like receptor 5 regulates the intestinal microbiota to prevent low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome in mice.

the interaction of tlrs in these metabolic cells or organs with gut microbiota remains unclear but a few studies have suggested that the functions of these tlrs are related to metabolism.

metabolic regulationintroductiontrillions of commensal bacteria reside in our gastrointestinal tract and the interactions between gut microbiota and the toll- like receptors tlrs on intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells help to maintain the homeostasis of our immune system .

alteration of the gut microbiota is associated with body weight change and adiposity in human and the interaction between the commensal gut microbiota and tlrs may possi- bly involve both metabolic and immunological regulation.

body weight change and increased adiposity are associated with alteration of gut microbiota and the interac- tion between gut microbiota and tlrs can be both immuno- logical and metabolic.

the function of tlrs in innate and adaptive immunity and how tlrs modulate host immunity via the interaction with gut microbiota are reviewed elsewhere .

high-fat intake or obesity can weaken gut integrity leading to the penetration of gut microbiota or their bacterial products into the circulation lead- ing to the activation of tlrs on immune cells and subsequent- ly low-grade systemic inflammation in host.

although they are able to produce inflammatory molecules the effectiveness remains low compared with the immune cells embedded in the liver and adipose tissue rendering the function of tlrs in these cells elusive -.

nonetheless tlrs are expressed in non-immune cells including adipocytes he- patocytes and smooth muscle cells.

these discrepancies may be partially related to the geographic socioeconomic or epi- genetic influence on gut microbiota of the individuals.likewise even though it is well accepted that alteration of gut microbiota can contribute to obesity and metabolic dys- function results from different laboratories appear to be in- consistent.

the evolutionary purpose of gut microbiota is re- lated to enhanced energy harvesting in host  and deple- tion of gut microbiota using antibiotics can promote browning of white adipose tissue and thus prevent obesity .

it is no doubt that the idea of manipulating gut microbiota to regulate body weight and metabolism requires further detailed investigation due to the complex relationship between the host and gut microbiota.gut microbiota pattern can be shaped by diet and substan- tial differences are observed in carnivores omnivores and herbivores .
