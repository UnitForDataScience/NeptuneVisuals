The prolonged contact of the colonized prostheses with the mucosa causes epithelial modifications that make the dental prosthesis user more susceptible to pathological events The events are aggravated by interactive mechanisms such as unwashed badly adapted broken or glued prosthe- ses which injure the patient's already sensitive mucosa and contribute to the proliferation of fungi and bacteria .It should be highlighted that the presence of a prosthesis in the oral cavity leads to a decrease in the saliva flow and pH In addition when the individual uses a complete dental prosthesis the mucosa area covered by the prosthesis cannot have contact with saliva and impedes tissue cleaning by the mechanical action of the tongue favoring the development of biofilms.Overall dental and dental prosthesis biofilm are similar in terms of complexity and microbial variation.

The target population consisted of 52 individuals.The criteria adopted for exclusion were age younger than 18 years having a natural dental element or any teeth replacement different from a removable complete dental prosthesis smokers alcohol users recent use of antibiotics and corticosteroids and diagnosis of autoimmune diseases secondary hypertension and diabetes mellitus.Due to the exclusion criteria the final sample consisted of 41 individuals using removable complete dental prostheses divided into Group 1 20 adults not diagnosed with SAH and Group 2 21 adults diagnosed with SAH.The diagnosis of SAH was self-reported and confirmed by the registers in the patient history at the health service or the prescribed use of antihypertensive drugs.Through an interview the data on the sociodemographic variables were obtained.

Considering the maxima and medians the extent of the figures is impressive especially concerning the uncount- able CFU of streptococci.Considering the median in the study groups and the parameters described in the literature 3-32 we identi- fied that for the microorganism Candida the hypertensive participants rank in the category of very high colonization indexhigh risk of infection.Hence our results indicate that the mouth of edentulous dental prosthesis users especially when hypertensive can constitute a reservoir of pathogens as important as the oral cavity of teethed individuals keeping in mind that individualsparticipants in the sample are on average almost six years older than the normotensive participants and therefore more predisposed to such events.In another study to assess the predominant colonization on the dental prostheses of the elderly 18 bacterial species were identified in the biofilms of the prostheses assessed the most frequent being Streptococcus spp.

To characterize the oral microbiota of normotensive and hypertensive users of dental prostheses.

The sample consisted of 41 complete dental prosthesis users divided into groups 21 participants with systemic arterial hypertension and 20 normotensive participants.

The mouth of dental prosthesis users especially when hypertensive can constitute an important reservoir of pathogens indicating an established inflammatory or infectious condition or risk for developing this condition.IntroductionThe relation between oral and general health has been well documented in the literature.

The risk is especially exacerbated when the edentulous patients use a dental prosthesis as the stay of artifacts in the oral cavity can significantly favor its microbial population .The oral mucosa and the support tissue of the prosthesis undergo generally inflammatory changes which can gain intensity across the period the device is used in.

In additionthe structure and chemical composition of the material the dental prosthesis is made of favor the colonization by micro- organisms.

The microflora found among dental prosthesis users is also multiple with a prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and yeasts 10.

Researchers have also observed that bacterial species fre- quently found in the periodontal area and strongly associated with systemic conditions can be found in the mouth ofedentulous prosthesis users or not 14.Hence we believe that the use of dental prostheses can affect the balance of the microbiological ecosystem in the mouth and lead to systemic changes.
