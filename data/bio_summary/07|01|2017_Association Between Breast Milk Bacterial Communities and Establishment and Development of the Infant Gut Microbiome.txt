breast milk bacteria that seed the gut first influence and select for bacteria that follow leaving a footprint that can be detected even in adulthood.16 our oligotype analysis indicated that breast milk provides veillonella and rothia bacteria genera that have been associ- ated with a lower incidence of asthma.6 these early bacterial seeding events may be a mechanism by which breastfeeding protects children.the breast milk microbiota become more divergent between mothers during the first 6 months of her infant's life.
