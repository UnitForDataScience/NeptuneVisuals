Values are shown as means -SEM n 5 rats per group and G-K. Immunohistochemical analysis of occludin-1 in the colon of rats fed control diet C high fat diet with 5 sucrose in their drinking water HFS obese rats consuming HFS  5 nopal HFS  N and obese rats switched to C diet with HFS-C  N or without HFS-C 5 nopal at the end of the treatment period 400X magnification.Consumption of nopal decreases brain oxidative stress neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function.

Wistar rats were fed one of the following diets control diet C high fat diet with 5 sucrose in their drinking water HFS HFS  5 nopal HFS  N and obese rats switched to C diet with HFS-C  N or without HFS-C 5 nopal.

Relative mRNA abundance of C leptin D Tnf-a E NADPH oxidase Nox and F amyloid precursor protein App in adipose tissue of Wistar rats fed one of the following diets control diet C high fat diet with 5 sucrose in drinking water HFS HFS  5 nopal HFS  N and obese rats switched to C diet with HFS-C  N or without HFS-C 5 nopal.

Relative expression of A Srebp-1 B Acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acc C Fas D Ppar-a and E Cpt-1 in liver of Wistar rats fed one of the following diets control diet C high fat diet with 5 sucrose in drinking water HFS HFS  5 nopal HFS  N and obese rats switched to C diet with HFS-C  N or without HFS-C 5 nopal.

Recent studies highlight the relation between gut microbiota and brain in particular obesity-induced dysbiosis has been associated with poor cognitive flexibility highlighting the role of microbiota on central nervous system function.In conclusion the results of the present work indicate that modifications in the diet can reduce several abnor- malities in biochemical parameters produced by obesity interestingly the addition of nopal can ameliorate spe- cific biochemical paremeters of obesity such as total cholesterol GIP APP leptin and Ab1-40 peptides modifying the gut microbiota despite the consumption of a HFS diet generating metabolic benefits similar to those observed when obese rats are switched to consume a C diet.

Interestingly inclusion of the nopal in HFS diet for 1 month resulted in a significant decrease in GIP and insulin concentrations indicating that nopal can prevent GIP hypersecretion and hyperinsulinemia.

We fed rats with a control diet C or high fat-sucrose diet HFS for 7 months pre-treatment period.
