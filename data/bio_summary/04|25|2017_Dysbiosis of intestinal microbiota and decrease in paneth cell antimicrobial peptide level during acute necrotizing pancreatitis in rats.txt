IL-1b level also significantly increased in ANP rats at 24h and 48h compared with that in the SO groups both p0.05 and had higher level at 48h than that at 24hChanges in intestinal barrier permeability and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and the distal ileum during ANP.

All above these indicated that intestinal barrier dysfunction happened in ANP and rats at 48h after ANP induction had the most severe injury in intestine.Changes in intestinal microbiota diversity and structure in ANPA total of 325300 high-quality sequences and 899 OTUs were obtained using pyrosequencing from the twenty samples of the SO48h and ANP48h groups.

All above these suggested that ANP might play a vital role in leading to the gut microbial structure changes.Antimicrobial peptides expression decreased in ANPTo investigate the alterations in Paneth cells during ANP real-time PCR western blot and immunofluorescence were used to measure lysozyme and a-defensin5 in mRNA and protein expression levels.

Taken together these findings demonstrated the abnormality of Paneth cells during ANP and implied that the dysfunction of Paneth cells was involved in intestinal barrier failure in ANP.

However the exact underlying mechanism between Paneth cells and intestinal barrier during ANP need further research.In summary the current study showed that ANP rats had aggravated systemic inflammation and intestinal barrier injury.

The intestinal barrier dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of ANP.

The SO group rats underwent a sham operation and were injected with normal saline 0.1mL100g.Rats were euthanasia by an intraperitoneal injection with the pentobarbital and were sacrificed by exsanguinations under deep anesthesia at 24h and 48h after ANP induction.

The morphological injury of the pancreas and distal ileum was the most severe at 48h time point after surgery.Pathological changes in the pancreas and the distal ileum in rats with ANP.

The immunofluorescence results manifested reduced Paneth cell lysozyme staining in the distal ileum of rats with ANP .Quantification of Paneth cells revealed that the number of Paneth cells in the ANP48h group decreased signifi- cantly compared with that in the SO48h group .

The causal relationship between intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and excessive inflammation still need further study.Antimicrobial peptides expression decreased in ANP.
