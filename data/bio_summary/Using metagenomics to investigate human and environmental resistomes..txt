Diluting the database with such genes means that the total resistance gene content will undoubtedly be overestimated as many of these target genes are ubiquitously occurring essential genes highly conserved between bacterial species.

Such approaches have been implemented in assem- blers such as TriMetAssand the SAT-Assembler.Assembly of genes existing in multiple genomic contextsThe greatest obstacle to enabling the assessment of the context of mobile resistance genes identified in metagenomic data is the na- ture of the resistance genes themselves.

That said since sequence data can be stored and re-used later shotgun metagenomics allows the retrospective analysis of resistance genes identified after the initial study has been completed.Shotgun metagenomics has been applied to quantify the abundances of many resistance genes in parallel for example in environments subjected to pharmaceutical pollutionsewage treatment plants-sea watertap waterand the human gut.However in terms of measuring specific gene abundances metagenomics is less sensi- tive i.e.

In the case of mobilized genes their sequences show limited vari- ation once they have appeared on mobile genetic elements MGEs.Because of the inherent dependency on sequence simi- larity selecting an appropriate sequence identity cut-off for calling a matching read a resistance gene becomes crucial.At the same time reads come with a certain degree of sequencing errors and there might be slight differences between resistance genes that do have the same function.

The x-axis is log- transformed for viewing purposes.based on bioinformatic analysis of sequence similarity will never be more accurate than that of the reference sequences select- ing a reference database with high-quality annotation is crucial.Simply put if the database only contains resistance genes against b-lactams you will likely grossly underestimate the number of resistance genes present.

On the other hand if the database contains genes incorrectly predicted to have resist- ance functions the abundance and diversity of resistance genes in the sample will be overestimated.

The ARG-ANNOT database employs what they refer to as 'relaxed search criteria' to identify resistance genes which in reality means that the database contains a multitude of sequences with poor annotation information and that many entries are unlikely to be functional resistance genes.

The database web site clearly states that target genes are present among its sequences and also provides a separate dataset with the target genes removed for use in metagenomic studies.

The use of MG-RAST to annotate re- sistance genes has led to some peculiar reports suggesting that al- most 1 in 25 genes found in human faeces would confer antibiotic resistance.The non-stringent identity cut-offs used by default in MG-RAST are likely to be a major cause of these results.
