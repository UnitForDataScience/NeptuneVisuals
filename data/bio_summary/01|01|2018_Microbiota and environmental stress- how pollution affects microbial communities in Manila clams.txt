Despite the mechanism of TCDF toxicity still needs to be elucidated in microbiota the results obtained indicate variations in composition of microbial communities just in AhR mice accompanied by decreased glucose and oligosaccharideconcentrations and increased level of short fatty acid in faeces and caecal contents.The two hypotheses proposed above appear to be both consistent with the results obtained at the transcriptional level in PM clams which showed a significant enrichment of molecular pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism pyruvate metabolism and cellular amino acid derivative metabolic processes .The significant over-representation of functional pathways involved in detoxification suggests the hypothesis of a synergistic role of hepa- topancreas-resident microbial communities acting in parallel with de- toxification processes occurring in host cells which were clearly iden- tified through biochemical and transcriptome analyses Milan et al.

A Bacterial class distribution within each sampling period obtained collapsing microbial community data from clams collected in different sites in the same period B Distribution of microbial communities in clams collected in the polluted site of Porto Marghera PM and in the remaining areas other sites OS within each sampling period.

Conversely along the y-axis PC2  7.63 and z-axis PC3  5.09 samples from PM are well separated from all the remaining sites B. PCoA results also show the homogeneity across the five pools representing each site sampling time with a variable level of discrimination between sam- pling areas C. Finally the trend of a-diversity seems to be mainly related to sampling season with higher microbial richness in clams collected in winter compared to summer samples D.To further explore changes in microbiota between summer and winter samples a one-way ANOVA was carried out to identify seasonal differences in composition either across all sites or excluding polluted ones PM.

Here we aim at assessing the impact of long-term exposure to pollutants on microbial communities as well as to evaluate the potential impact of changes of microbial communities on host xenobiotic metabolism and suscept- ibility to environmental chemicals two crucial but still unresolved questions in ecotoxicology.Materials and methodsSample collection and chemical analysesAdults Manila clams were collected in different periods June 2009 December 2009 January 2011 in the Venice lagoon areas of Porto Marghera PM Chioggia CH Colmata CO Alberoni AL and Sant'Erasmo SE see .

Our results confirm such evidence since microbial communities associated with Manila clam digestive gland showed high diversity with a total of 389 taxonomic groups considering together the OTU with the same taxonomic definition of which only 19 represented the core micro- biome see .Overall the microbial community in the Manila clam hepatopan- creas which was primarily composed by Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria  appeared similar to what has been de- scribed in the oyster digestive gland  .

A role of Arcobacter as opportunistic microorganism colonizing dysfunctional clams seems in agreement with the evidence from biochemical and transcriptomic markers which suggested tissue damage and disruption of several metabolic processes in clams sampled in PM  .

Likewise further analysis would be required to understand whether the composition of microbial communities in the clam digestive gland in PM samples simply reflects the abundance of detoxifying bacteria in the surrounding environment or selective processes occur within the host where pollutants tend to accumulate.

Conversely the KEGG pathway genetic information processing were under-represented in PM com- pared to other areas.DiscussionDespite its great ecological and commercial relevance just a single study has explored the composition of Manila clam microbiota to date .

Such observa- tion appears to be consistent with the prevalence of putatively phyto- plankton-associated microbes in the digestive gland microbiome of clams during the warmer season.Characterization of microbial communities in clams chronically exposed to chemical pollutantsResults from both PCoA and ANOVA clearly indicated that inFig.

Of note also Marinobacter and Alteromonas two marine genera that have been recently reported to dominate diatom-associated microbiotas and refer- ences therein were over-represented in the warmer season see .Changes in hepatopancreas microbial composition in clams from Porto MargheraTo better understand the effects of chemical pollution a one-way ANOVA analysis was performed in order to identify significant differ- ences in microbial communities between PM and other sites OS.
