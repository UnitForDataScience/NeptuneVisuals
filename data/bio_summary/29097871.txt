Collectively these observations indicate that FMT is capable of improving learning and memory deficits in the rat HE model.FMT restores hepatic function in a dose-dependent mannerSince FMT effectively improved the behavior and spatial cognitive capability of rats with HE we next determined whether FMT affected rat hepatic function in the HE model.

The data described here demonstrate a systematic relief of HE severity in rats and it was clear that systemic inflammation but not ammonia was strongly correlated with increasing grades of HE.FMT protects HE progression through distinct mechanismsAlthough FMT has been shown to be effective in a rat model of HE leading to improved hepatic and intestinal function and impaired systemic inflammation the underlying mechanisms of these processes have not been investigated.

We therefore evaluated the levels of liver TLR4 and TLR9 and circulating IL-1b IL-6 and TNF-a in the HE model and FMT-treated rats.Our data here suggest that VSL treatment efficiently reduced circulating IL-1b and TNF-a but not IL-6 a well-established independent risk factor for HE that was negatively associated with cognitive functions in HE patients47-49.

Our experiment still cannot fully explain whether FMT is superior to VSL3 or not which requires more experimental or clinical evidence.Collectively our study provided experimental evidence for the first time that supports an FMT- enabled protective role in treating HE rats and revealed the mechanisms behind FMT function thus providing a basis for potential clinical application of FMT in HE patients.BackgroundHepatic encephalopathy HE is a disease of liver dysfunction and there is currently no effective therapy for treatment of this condition.

Therefore the use of probiotics for cirrhotic patients with HE cannot be currently recommended and rigorous clinical evaluation in randomized controlled trials is required22-25.Given the limitations of current HE therapy research efforts are now aimed at improving existing treatments or developing novel therapies.

However whether FMT has a healing effect on HE has not been investigated.In this study we present in vivo evidence that FMT is effective for improving HE symptoms as evidenced by increased rat motor activity spatial learning and memory following FMT.

Although decades of clinical practice have demonstrated that nonabsorbable disaccharides such as lactulose or lactitol are effective for approximately 80 of HE patients little survival benefit in cirrhotic HE patients has been observed following treatment with these agents.

Rat behaviors and spatial learning capability were observed and hepatic necrosis intestinal mucosal barrier serum ammonia levels and intestinal permeability were determined in HE rats receiving FMT treatment.

Furthermore the expression of tight junction proteins Claudin-1 Claudin-6 and Occludin Toll-like receptor TLR 4TLR9 interleukin IL-1b IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor TNF-a was examined.RESULTSFMT improved rat behaviors HE grade and spatiallearning capability.
