although crossing times increased along with fmt dose this relationship did not reach statistical significance among fmt-l fmt-m and fmt-h. collectively these observations indicate that fmt is capable of improving learning and memory deficits in the rat he model.fmt restores hepatic function in a dose-dependent mannersince fmt effectively improved the behavior and spatial cognitive capability of rats with he we next determined whether fmt affected rat hepatic function in the he model.

rat behaviors and spatial learning capability were observed and hepatic necrosis intestinal mucosal barrier serum ammonia levels and intestinal permeability were determined in he rats receiving fmt treatment.

in cases of normal hepatic function ammonia enters the portal circulation of the liver and is subsequently converted to urea through the urea cycle1.gut microbiota has emerged as a critical factor in the development of he.

therefore probiotics may prevent he recurrence by decreasing urease-producing bacteria populations and ammonia absorption while also increasing hepatic ammonia clearance21.

moreover fmt reduces systematic inflammation leading to restored hepatic and intestinal dysfunction.
