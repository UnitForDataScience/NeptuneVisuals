Benefits from diversified crop rotations extend beyond yield and include increased soil nutrients and organic matter content improved soil structure enhanced soil microbial biomass increase in micro- bial diversity and activity and disruption of pests weeds and disease cycles-.

Furthermore the four-year rotations including sunflower Helianthus annus L. resulted in greater soil carbon accumulation and soil aggregate stability over the 16 year period Osborne et al.

A soil dilution approach was selected in order to test multiple replicates per soil provenance and biotic stressor combinations.

Pots were setup in the greenhouse in a randomized design with 8 pots per rotation field soil soil provenance and infestation treatment combination.

Each 2 L pot was filled halfway with 12 field soil - potting mixture described above followed by 20 g of F. graminearum infested cornmeal or non-infested cornmeal for controls and filled to the top with the field soil - potting mix.

Further analyses of soil origin and infestation effects on fungal com- munities associated with maize seedlings in this experiment were performed after removal of the F. graminearum OTU.The relative effects of soil provenance and infestation on maize rhizosphere-associated bacterial and fun- gal communities as evaluated by 16S and ITS2 sequences were assessed through correspondence analysis and ordination Figs and .

Predicted bacterial functional diversity as a whole did not respond to soil provenance with no observable clustering of samples on the ordination space based on soil origin Supplementary Figure 7.
