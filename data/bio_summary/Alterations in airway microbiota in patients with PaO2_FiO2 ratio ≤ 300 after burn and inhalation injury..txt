Figs and display OTU abundances at the family level that account for greater than 1 of the total OTUs among individual patients without and with PaO2FiO2 S 300 respectively.Alpha diversity among patients with and without PaO2FiO2 S 300The Chao1 diversity index which is a non-parametric species richness estimator  did not show significant differences in number of different OTUs between patients with and without PaO2FiO2 S 300 .

Though the median Chao1 index in patients with PaO2FiO2  300 is less than that of patients with PaO2FiO2 S 300 it shows a much broader range in patients with PaO2FiO2  300.Increased detection of unique facultative anaerobic taxa.

Patients with hypoxemia as indicated by a PaO2FiO2 ratio  Chou Yong -Yong yeossYong 300 had a 30 increase in abundance of Streptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and 84 increase in Staphylococcaceae as compared to patients with a PaO2FiO2 ratio  300.

When we split the data by PaO2FiO2 ratio patients with PaO2FiO2 300 contained more unique facultative anaerobic OTUs than those with PaO2 FiO2 S 300 but this difference was not significant .

However when compared to patients with PaO2FiO2  300 patients with PaO2FiO2 S 300 had a 27 increase in OTUs identified as Streptococcus spp.

A longitu- dinal study of patients with burn and inhalation injury could clarify the role of these taxa.Due to its association with health outcomes overall diversity has long been a focus in many microbiome studies however we observed no difference in alpha diversity between patients with PaO2FiO2 S 300 and those with PaO2FiO2  300 .

Patients with- out P. melaninogenica and PaO2FiO2 ratio  300 tended to cluster together but those without this microbe and PaO2FiO2 ratio  300 were scattered throughout the graph.

While determining a causal link between PaO2FiO2 S 300 and Prevotella melaninogenica is beyond the scope of the current study future studies will examine its pathogenicity from patients with and without PaO2FiO2 S 300 as well as its role in either preceding or following hypoxemia.Infection is a serious concern in these immunocompromised patients for whom mortality rates increase to 20 with inhalation injury alone and triple to 60 when present with pneu- monia .
