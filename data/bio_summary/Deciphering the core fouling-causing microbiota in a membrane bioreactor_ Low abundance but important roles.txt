The main conclusions of this study are as followsThe similarity of the fouling-related communities revealed by PCoA showed different bacterial composition patterns in low-fouling 10 kPa bio-cake high-fouling 25 kPa bio-cake and membrane pores.The LEfSe algorithm identified 76 active biomarkers sepa- rately overrepresent in 10 kPa-Bio-cake 25 kPa-Bio-cake Bulk sludge and Membrane pore which were responsible for driving the divergences among these groups regardless of their relative abundance.Most of the interactions among species in the community were negative as revealed by network analysis demon- strating the crucial role of fierce competition in determining the bio-cake ecological microbiota.According to the results of LEfSe algorithm and network analysis most of the core species were not ranked high in the bio-cake e.g.

The general network topological features  revealed that all curves of the network connectivity distribution were fitted well with the R squared power-law model R2 0.76 suggesting that few OTUs in the network had numerous connec- tions while most OTUs had only few connections .

bio-cake and bulk sludge microbiota from a microbial ecology view are expected to provide more details about the development of biofouling and meanwhile provide new insight into biofouling control strategies.To date the microbial community in MBRs has been investi-gated extensively including the community compositions of the bulk sludge and bio-cake in different fouling stages and the im- pacts of various physicochemical conditions.

The results corroborates that some low-abundant populations play significant roles in determining the microbial community structure of bio-cake.Species-species associationAn RMT-based network graph was constructed to illuminate the ecological interactions of different species in microbial commu- nities a.

However currently information regarding microbial ecological network association in activated sludge ecosystems especially in the bio-cake of fouled membranes is rarely reported  .The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the potential roles of individual species and species-species in- teractions in the microbiota organization of the activated sludge ecosystem in MBRs.

Additionally a phylogenetic molecular ecological network was constructed to deduce the potential interactions among microbial populations and the pivotal roles of the low-abundance species in bio-cake microbiota were illuminated.

Furthermore the characterization of microbial in- teractions using a random matrix theory RMT-based network approach obtained a network consisting of 120 nodes and 228 edges.

The microbial community structure in both bulk sludge and bio-cake were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing.

Other species such as fRhodothermaceae OTU146287 and gTreponema OTU40583 merely amount to a very low relative abundance in all samples averaging 0.33 and 0.38 respectively suggesting that these low-abundance micro- organisms could be keystone populations in the bio-cake micro- biota and most likely to play more important roles than some abundant species in the ecological network.DiscussionBio-cake microbiota dynamic along with fouling developmentIn this study the PCoA results revealed that the bio-cake mi- crobial community structure showed a significant change before and after the TMP jump.
