in contrast close clustering of 25 kpa-bio-cake and bulk sludge samples indicated that the bulk sludge deposited intensively on the membranes during the tmp jump period.in addition lefse was performed to identify the differentially abundant species of the core fouling microbiota.

recently the low-abundance species have been increasingly recognized as overlooked keystone species regulating the function of natural ecosystems .additionally several studies have demonstrated that low- abundance species can play an over-proportional role in nitrogen sulfate and carbon cycling in terrestrial and aquatic habitats  .

the main conclusions of this study are as followsthe similarity of the fouling-related communities revealed by pcoa showed different bacterial composition patterns in low-fouling 10 kpa bio-cake high-fouling 25 kpa bio-cake and membrane pores.the lefse algorithm identified 76 active biomarkers sepa- rately overrepresent in 10 kpa-bio-cake 25 kpa-bio-cake bulk sludge and membrane pore which were responsible for driving the divergences among these groups regardless of their relative abundance.most of the interactions among species in the community were negative as revealed by network analysis demon- strating the crucial role of fierce competition in determining the bio-cake ecological microbiota.according to the results of lefse algorithm and network analysis most of the core species were not ranked high in the bio-cake e.g.

however currently information regarding microbial ecological network association in activated sludge ecosystems especially in the bio-cake of fouled membranes is rarely reported  .the objective of this study was therefore to investigate the potential roles of individual species and species-species in- teractions in the microbiota organization of the activated sludge ecosystem in mbrs.

other species such as frhodothermaceae otu146287 and gtreponema otu40583 merely amount to a very low relative abundance in all samples averaging 0.33 and 0.38 respectively suggesting that these low-abundance micro- organisms could be keystone populations in the bio-cake micro- biota and most likely to play more important roles than some abundant species in the ecological network.discussionbio-cake microbiota dynamic along with fouling developmentin this study the pcoa results revealed that the bio-cake mi- crobial community structure showed a significant change before and after the tmp jump.

specifically bulk sludge samples were taken from the aerobic tank on day 10 40 70 100 and 120. bio-cake samples were collected by slightly scraping off the cake layer from the membrane surface of the three modules at a tmp of 10 day 125 and 25 kpa day 130 see .

within the phylum proteobacteria epsilonproteobacteria merely accounted for an extremely low abundance 0.024e0.070 average 0.041. more detailed the membrane pore samples possessed gammaproteo- bacteria as the predominant class while betaproteobacteria was the most dominant class 9.31e17.76 averaging at 12.92 in the bulk sludge bio-cake and residual samples.

as presented in b the dominant genera seemed to show strong habitat characteristics i polysaccharide-producing bacteria xanthomonadaceaegenerais were abundant in 10 kpa-bio-cake samples 6.19e12.11 ii fila- mentous gkouleothrix were predominant in 25 kpa-bio-cake samples 21.68e23.44 and iii in particular membrane pore samples were dominated by multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  ranging from 21.76 to 35.70 .

observed an increase in microbial evenness with no significant decrease in richness for the bio-cake  indicating that the dominant species rather than the rare species were significantly affected by naocl.

in particular this analysis method can give new insights into the complex microbiota topological structure including community organization princi- ples keystone species and interactions between community members  rather than the simple species rich- ness and abundance.

interestingly the microbial communities of residual layer which referred to as the cake layer that underwent naocl backwash showed a significant increase in evenness as revealed by pdwholetree and shannon indexes  suggesting that naocl backwash had a significant impact on the dominant species rather than the rare species in the bio-cake .
