K-N Mouse ears were exposed to IS or IS  ATB K and L. Mice were left untreated or were treated with anakinra 12 hr and immediately before exposure to IS IS  Ana M and N. K and M Mouse ear sections were stained with anti-Gr1 antibody 6 hr after exposure to IS.

Data are pooled from two independent experiments n R 13 for IS n R 5 mice for LI.C-I Mouse ears 3-48 hr after exposure to 20 IS 20 uninfected sand flies US intradermal co-inoculation with LI plus extract of one salivary gland LG and LI.

Although neutrophil recruitment was generally similar after IS and US it was significantly higher at 18 hr after IS C and 1E potentially due to parasites or to the promastigote secretory gel and exosomes both reported to attract neutrophils .

Monocyte recruitment was not observed up to 6 hr data not shown but was significantly higher at 18 hr after IS compared with LG and LI F. Interestingly the number of recruited neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes per ear af- ter IS compared with US was augmented by correcting for fed flies becoming significant for monocytes at 18 hr Figure S2B.

Importantly after immunoprecipitation using apoptosis-associ- ated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain ASC NLRP3 detection was considerably stronger after IS compared with US G and Table S1 signifying a more efficient assembly of the inflammasome after IS.

Consistent with these conclusions Nlrp3 expression was significantly higher while expression of Ifnb an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome  was reduced after IS compared with US over the timeline of the study H. Apoptotic cells that contribute to inflammasome activation   and promote an anti-inflammatory environ- ment  were also more prevalent in ear sections after IS compared with US I.Since Leishmania species have been reported to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome   we incubated lipopolysaccharide LPS-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages BMDM with stationary-phase L. donovani parasites.

Diminishing Sand Fly Gut Microbiota Mitigates Inflammasome Activation Abrogates Neutrophil Recruitment and Compromises Dissemination of L. donovani In A-L sand flies harboring mature infections with L. donovani were left untreated IS or were provided a cocktail of three antibiotics for 36 hr prior to parasite transmission to mouse ears IS  ATB.Bacterial colony growth on LBagar after plating 10 midguts.antibiotics were similar to controls in their survival B their support of Leishmania growth and differentiation to infective metacyclics C the virulence of their midgut-resident metacyclics assessed by their ability to invade and replicate within BMDM D and 4E their feeding behavior  F and their capacity to transmit parasites to mouse ears G.Diminishing gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment had a sig- nificant effect on decreasing the IL-1b protein level after bites when compared with controls H. Additionally protein levels of NLRP3 pro-caspase-1 and cleaved caspase-1 as well as IL-1b were reduced in skin exposed to antibiotic-treated sand flies compared with controls I and Table S1.

Data in A to C are representative of four independent experiments n R 9 sand flies per condition per time point.D and E In vitro invasion and multiplication of anterior gut-residing parasites from IS or IS  ATB in bone marrow-derived macrophages BMDM.
