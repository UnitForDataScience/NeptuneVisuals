Home- ostasis disruption and deregulation of protease ac- tivity lead to numerous pathologic disorders such as cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases 6-8cancer 9 and neurological disorders 10.

Thereby numer- ous protease inhibitors are already used as medical treatments and many more are under development 11.
