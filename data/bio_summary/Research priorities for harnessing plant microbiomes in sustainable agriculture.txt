the american academy of microbiology  unified microbiome initiative  report on the fast-track action com- mittee on mapping the microbiome  american phytopathological society  earth microbiome project  genomic standards consortium  and national microbiome initiative  have each called for the standardization of data collection processing and anal- ysis.

two related questions are to what extent does the host influence microbiome assembly and is within-spe- cies host genetic variation sufficient for breeding improved microbiome associations studies typically find broad-sense heritability of only approximately 5-7  so the ability ofgenotype environment management method and microbiome interact to influence yield.

additionally metagenome-wide association studies in which variants in the metagenome such as the presenceabsence of a certain microbial gene are used to predict host phenotype  could nominate subsets of the microbiome that play key roles in host performance under the major stressors facing agriculture today and in the near future.rules of microbiome assembly and resiliencebeyond knowledge of the identity and functional attributes of microbes present in crop plant core microbiomes determining the rules by which microbes assemble into those communi- ties will be essential for any attempt to manipulate or manage the agricultural microbiome.the extraordinary complexity of plant microbial communities presents a daunting barrier to fully understanding the ecology of plant-associated microbiomes and for this reason the links between microbiome assembly and plant performance are still poorly understood .

a coordinated research effort for plant microbiomes analogous to the human microbiome project is needed to accelerate the integration of beneficial plant microbiomes into modern agricultural practices that are under strain from human population growth and a changing global climate.studies to date have explored plant microbiome structure and function under natural and agricultural environments in both model and crop plant species including arabidopsis thaliana - barley hordeum vulgare  soybean glycine max  corn zea mays  wheat triticum aestivum  rice oryza sativa - and cottonwood trees populus tricho- carpa  however there has been no coordinated effort to consolidate and translate new ideas into practical solutions for farmers.

collectively a multidisciplin- ary community comprising academic and commercial plant microbiome scientists with sup- port from funding agencies is necessary to establish effective model systems to elucidateplant-microbiome interactions with maximum interoperability--a critical step towards estab- lishing a knowledge base for sustainable high-yielding agriculture innovation.defining the core plant microbiome and core plant metagenomein addition to model systems and culture collections targeted studies of agricultural micro- biomes in the field provide key foundational knowledge that can lead to innovation in several ways.

d e management methods primarily influence yield by altering the dynamics of genotype x environment x microbiome interactions but can also modify the crop microbiome directly e.g.

however microbiomes could be engineered to increase heritability  and targeted breeding approaches may succeed once we have the foundational knowledge of the host molecular basis of microbiome assembly.fourth comparing the core microbiota of genetically distinct plant groups could reveal plant genes and functional traits that influence microbiome assembly.

all of these questions could be initially addressed in gnotobi- otic systems in the lab and then tested in greenhouse and field experiments.in addition to genetic properties of the microbiome the method of microbiome inoculation can play a major role in its success as demonstrated by years of agronomic work optimizing delivery of single strains via seed coatings clay particles and peat.

discovering community-level characteristicsthat precede potential pathogenic or beneficial interactions in constructed synthetic communi- ties as well as in wild soil ecosystems could also lead to diagnostic and predictive tools for farmers and regulatory agencies.plant genotype x microbiome x environment x management interactionsthe previously discussed goals of defining core microbiomes identifying functional mecha- nisms of beneficial symbioses and discovering the rules of microbiome assembly share a com- mon theme sensitivity to host genetic and environmental context as well as management decisions.

host genotype effects on the microbiome can vary in strength among environments and even between different plant tissues  .another challenge is to design microbiome treatments that are resilient to the tremendous environmental variability among farms.

for instance to better understand what microbiome or metagenome properties provide maximum benefit under various contexts  artificial microbiome selection under host-micro- biome co-propagation could be performed by manipulating individual environmental stress- ors e.g.

here we identify priorities for research in this area 1 develop model host-microbiome systems for crop plants and non-crop plants with associated microbial culture collections and reference genomes 2 define core micro- biomes and metagenomes in these model systems 3 elucidate the rules of synthetic func- tionally programmable microbiome assembly 4 determine functional mechanisms ofplant-microbiome interactions and 5 characterize and refine plant genotype-by-environ- ment-by-microbiome-by-management interactions.

meeting these goals should accelerate our ability to design and implement effective agricultural microbiome manipulations and management strategies which in turn will pay dividends for both the consumers and pro- ducers of the world food supply.introductiona growing appreciation of microbial diversity and function in combination with advances in omics i.e.

the study of large-scale biological datasets including genes transcripts proteins and metabolites and data analytics technologies are fueling rapid advances in microbiome research.
