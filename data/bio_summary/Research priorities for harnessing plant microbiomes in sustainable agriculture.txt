A coordinated research effort for plant microbiomes analogous to the Human Microbiome Project is needed to accelerate the integration of beneficial plant microbiomes into modern agricultural practices that are under strain from human population growth and a changing global climate.Studies to date have explored plant microbiome structure and function under natural and agricultural environments in both model and crop plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana - barley Hordeum vulgare  soybean Glycine max  corn Zea mays  wheat Triticum aestivum  rice Oryza sativa - and cottonwood trees Populus tricho- carpa  however there has been no coordinated effort to consolidate and translate new ideas into practical solutions for farmers.
