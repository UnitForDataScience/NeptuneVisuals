We specifically aimed to i assess the com- munity composition and structure of human microbiota biofilms following exposure to Giardia ii investigate the impact of G. duodenalis-perturbed microbiota biofilms in vivo using human- ized germ-free mice and iii determine whether Giardia interac- tions with human microbiota biofilms may induce changes in epithelial monolayer integrity and function.

b-Diversity was assessed using the Bray-Curtis distance metric and while samples showed large within group variation the largest source of variation between groups was treatment withGiardia C. a-diversity was measured using the Shannondiversity index and microbiota in faeces from mice receiving Giar- dia-treated biofilms had greater a-diversity than those mice receiving control biofilms D P  0.01 by Mann-Whitney U- test.Giardia-modified biofilms promote the formation of mucosal B lymphocyte follicles and increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokinesHistological examination of colonic morphology in mice receiv- ing human microbiota biofilms revealed lymphocyte aggregations within the colonic mucosa of animals reconstituted with GMBBF communities A and B.

Community profiles of faecal microbiota of germ-free mice reconstituted with human microbiota biofilms mice were given either untreated microbiota Control or microbiota challenged with Giardia duodenalis Giardia.

Following a 72 h growth period microbiota biofilms were subject to either control conditions fresh sTSY medium Escherichia coli exposure to Giardia or exposure to Giardia G spent medium.

B Spectrofluorometric assay using Wheat-germAgglutinin dye for the quantification of extracellular matrix in control microbiota mucosal biofilms Control MBBF those exposed to live Giardia trophozoites Giardia MBBF and those exposed to live commensal Escherichia coli E. coli MBBF.

Caco-2 monolayers co-incubated for 24 h with planktonic constituents of microbiota biofilms exposed to Giardia spent medium Caco-2  Giardia MBBPlank exhibited significantly higher rates of apoptosis compared with cells incubated with microbiota biofilm communities exposed to fresh sTSY Caco-2  Control MBBPlank.

Finally planktonic bac- teria from biofilms exposed to Giardia spent medium significantly induced increased epithelial CXCL-8 production an effect that was also cysteine protease-dependent .Based on our current study we propose that Giardia may alter the structure and composition of human intestinal microbiota bio- films and that bacteria from these dysbiotic microbiota in turn can cause epithelial and intestinal abnormalities after the enteropatho- gen has been cleared.

Exposure of human microbiota biofilms to Giardia and Giardia spent medium resulted in a significant reduction in ECM.
