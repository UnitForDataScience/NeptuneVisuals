We pres- ent here the high-quality whole genome sequences of the Oligo-MM12 strains which were obtained by combining the accuracy of the Illumina platforms with the long reads of the PacBio technology.n a recent study we described a defined intestinal community of 12 murine strains termed Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota Oligo-MM12 which permanently colonize gnotobi- otic mice over several generations and provide colonization resistance against Salmo- nella enterica serovar Typhimurium .

Since the Oligo-MM12 strains are being used by an increasing number of research groups   the multitude of genome sequences precludes the possibility of a meaningful exchange of data within the scientific community.

Thus there is a strong need for availability and constantupdate of the Oligo-MM12 reference genomes.It is well recognized that sequences from the Illumina platforms have low error rates with systematic errors being mainly situated at the end of the reads but are too short for an efficient complete genome assembly .

Aiming to create a set of reference genomes in this study we present the high-quality genome sequences of the Oligo-MM12 bacteria which were assembled by a hybrid approach combining Illumina and PacBio sequences .As previously described  the complete genome sequence of Acutalibacter muris KB18 was obtained on the PacBio RSII platform and assembled using the RSHGAP Assembly.3 protocol default parameters.

The assembled whole-genome sequences of the Oligo-MM12 strains have been deposited in DDBJENAGenBank under the accession numbers given in .ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Cathrin Sproer Nicole Heyer and Simone Severitt for sequencing of the KB18 PacBio genome.This work was supported by the German Center for Infection Research DZIF the Center for Gastrointestinal Microbiome Research CEGIMIR and the German Research Foundation DFG.
