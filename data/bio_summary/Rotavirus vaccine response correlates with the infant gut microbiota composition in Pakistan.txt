Finally microbiota profiles might be used to predict which infants are at risk for RVV failure and in need of additional vaccine doses or targeted education.MethodsStudy design and participantsAll participating Pakistani infants were healthy 4-6 weeks of age at enrolment with a birth-weight  1500g exact gestational age unknown and had been previously enrolled in a phase IV open-label randomized clinical trial of RV1 immunogenicity NCT01199874 clinical- trials.gov examining the effect of different RV1 dosing schedules 61014 610 and 1014 weeks and withhold- ing breastfeeding around the time of vaccine administra- tion on RV1 immunogenicity.The trial was conducted in a peri-urban low- income slum along the seacoast in Karachi Pakistan.Serum samples were collected prior to the first dose of vaccine and 28 days following the last dose of vaccine 14 or 18 weeks depending on study arm for anti- rotavirus IgA antibody measurements.

IgA seroconversion to greater than 20 IU mL following vaccination was considered a surrogate marker for RV1 protection against severe rotavirus gas- troenteritis.Participating infants were grouped as either RV1 responders post-vaccination 14 andor 18 week anti-RV IgA antibody  20 IUmL in infants with a pre- vaccination IgA  20 IUmL or non-responders and matched in a 11 ratio using the ranked variables RV1 study arm dose and breastfeeding arms RV season in Karachi defined as the date of the 28 days post-vaccina- tion serum IgA falling between December 1st 2011 and February 1st 2012 mode of delivery vaginal or caesar- ean section breastfeeding practices exclusive breast- feeding breastfeeding and formula or formula only place of delivery home or health care facility age of fecal sample collection in weeks and sex.The nested trial was approved by the institutional review board of Aga Khan University and was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines.In parallel we anonymously compared the micro- biota of healthy full-term Dutch infants to our Pakis- tani RV1 non-responders and responders.

The most notable difference observed was in the rela- tive abundance of Gram-negative bacteria related to Serratia and Escherichia coli which were positively associated with vaccine response and were approxi- mately 2 and 4-fold reduced respectively in the non- responders p 0.01 FDR 0.19 for Serratia and p 0.00 FDR 0.05 for E. coli Supplementary Table 2  and .Pakistani infants compared to healthy dutch infantsIn a second analysis we hypothesized that if microbial differences identified between RV1 responders and non-responders in Pakistan were actually influencing vaccine response then similar differences should exist between vaccine non-responders in Pakistan and chil- dren in wealthier countries with high levels of RVV protection.

An additional hypothesis is that a higher abundance of LPS derived from E. coli may also be augmenting RV1 immune responses in responders - accumulating data demonstrates that E.coli-derived LPS has stronger immune-stimulatory capacity than LPS inthe cell walls of other gram-negative organisms such as those in the Bacteroidetes phylum.In a parallel study correlating RV1 response with microbiome composition in rural Ghana we recently observed that a high abun- dance of Bacteroidetes in the fecal microbiome was nega- tively correlated with RV1 seroconversion.

To test this we conducted an exploratory nested case-control pilot study in Karachi Pakistan comparing the differen- ces in pre-vaccination fecal microbiota composition between infants with and without an anti-rotavirus Immunoglobulin Ig A seroconversion to RV1.A second hypothesis was that if there are biologi- cally significant differences in microbiome composi- tion between vaccine responders and non-responders within Pakistan one would expect similar differences in microbiome composition to exist between develop- ing and developed country infants with assumed high RV1 seroconversion rate.

The study is primarily limited by power - the low vaccine response 15 among infants with an available fecal sample meant that we were only able to evaluate 10 RV1 responders in depth.

Additionally in the original dosing study RV IgA seroconversion was 36 to 39 depending on study arm so the cohort of RV1 responder infants that we were able to examine might be a skewed patient population.
