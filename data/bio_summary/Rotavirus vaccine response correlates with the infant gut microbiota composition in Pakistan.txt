iga seroconversion to greater than 20 iu ml following vaccination was considered a surrogate marker for rv1 protection against severe rotavirus gas- troenteritis.participating infants were grouped as either rv1 responders post-vaccination 14 andor 18 week anti-rv iga antibody  20 iuml in infants with a pre- vaccination iga  20 iuml or non-responders and matched in a 11 ratio using the ranked variables rv1 study arm dose and breastfeeding arms rv season in karachi defined as the date of the 28 days post-vaccina- tion serum iga falling between december 1st 2011 and february 1st 2012 mode of delivery vaginal or caesar- ean section breastfeeding practices exclusive breast- feeding breastfeeding and formula or formula only place of delivery home or health care facility age of fecal sample collection in weeks and sex.the nested trial was approved by the institutional review board of aga khan university and was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines.in parallel we anonymously compared the micro- biota of healthy full-term dutch infants to our pakis- tani rv1 non-responders and responders.

finally microbiota profiles might be used to predict which infants are at risk for rvv failure and in need of additional vaccine doses or targeted education.methodsstudy design and participantsall participating pakistani infants were healthy 4-6 weeks of age at enrolment with a birth-weight  1500g exact gestational age unknown and had been previously enrolled in a phase iv open-label randomized clinical trial of rv1 immunogenicity nct01199874 clinical- trials.gov examining the effect of different rv1 dosing schedules 61014 610 and 1014 weeks and withhold- ing breastfeeding around the time of vaccine administra- tion on rv1 immunogenicity.the trial was conducted in a peri-urban low- income slum along the seacoast in karachi pakistan.serum samples were collected prior to the first dose of vaccine and 28 days following the last dose of vaccine 14 or 18 weeks depending on study arm for anti- rotavirus iga antibody measurements.

an additional hypothesis is that a higher abundance of lps derived from e. coli may also be augmenting rv1 immune responses in responders - accumulating data demonstrates that e.coli-derived lps has stronger immune-stimulatory capacity than lps inthe cell walls of other gram-negative organisms such as those in the bacteroidetes phylum.in a parallel study correlating rv1 response with microbiome composition in rural ghana we recently observed that a high abun- dance of bacteroidetes in the fecal microbiome was nega- tively correlated with rv1 seroconversion.

nevertheless we believe that the time point directly prior to rv1 vaccination is the most important window into the potential interactionbetween the rotavirus vaccine and the infant's micro- biome.

therefore 71 children were eligible and enrolled in this study.sufficient and good-quality dna was obtained from 66 of the 71 fecal samples 93 and these were further characterized using phylogenetic microarray analysis.ten 15 of the 66 infants had an iga 20 iuml and classified as rv1 responders and these infants were then carefully matched based on six relevant var- iables to an equal number of rv1 non-responders see for baseline characteristics.

while undeniably speculative these two studies may comple- ment one another - proteobacteria and e. coli- derived lps might boost rv1 responses in some populations whereas bacteroidetes-derived and potentially inhibi- tory lps might inhibit rv1 responses in others.alternatively more abundant neonatal colonization with proteobacteria could have a role in educating the innate immune system.

controls were defined as rv1 non-responders - infants with a serum rv iga  20 iuml pre-vaccination and post-vaccination.a chi-square test was used to determine statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between rv1 responders case and non-responders controls.comprehensive multivariate statistical analyses were performed using canoco 5.0 software for windows.
