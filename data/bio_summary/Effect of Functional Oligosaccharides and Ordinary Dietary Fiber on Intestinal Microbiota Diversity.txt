GI galacto-oligosaccharides  inulin group PF polydextrose  insoluble dietary fiber group GIPF GI and PF supplementation at a 11 ratio group.

To identify prebiotic- or dietary fiber-related factors that contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota we performed a dietary intervention study in which we compared three different combinations of feed additives GI GOS and inulin PF polydextrose and insoluble dietary fiber and a GIPF mixture GI and PF 11.

All of the protocols used in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences Beijing China and the procedures were carried out in accordance with the European Community guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals.The twenty-four 10-week-old male BALBc mice were randomly divided into four groups n 6 control group GI group PF group and GIPF group.

To investigate their effects on the intestinal microecosystem three kinds of diets containing different prebiotics were used to feed mice for 3 weeks as follows GI galacto-oligosaccharides and inulin PF polydextrose and insoluble dietary fiber from bran and a GIPF mixture GI and PF 11 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolic analysis of mice feces were then conducted.

As shown in  the control group was fed the control diet and the other three groups were fed separate diets supplemented with GI 7.5 GOS and 7.5 inulin PF 7.5 polydextrose and 7.5 insoluble dietary fiber or GIPF 7.5 GI and 7.5 PF during the intervention period .

Thus we suggested that maintaining microbiota diversity and the abundance of dominant bacteria in the intestine is extremely important for the health and that the addition of a combination of oligosaccharides and dietary fiber helps maintain the health of the intestinal microecosystem.Keywords functional oligosaccharides intestinal microbiota diversity fecal metabolic profiling microecosystemINTRODUCTIONThe human gastrointestinal tract contains about 500-1500 different species of gut microorganisms  .

Based on comparisons of the ratio of the peak area between the experimental groups and the control group supplementation with functional oligosaccharides andor ordinary dietary fiber led to significant biochemical changes in the fecal microbiota.

The levels of TMAO in the serum were significantly increased in mice after 3 weeks of supplementation with GI or PF p  0.05 while no significant change was observed in the GIPF group.
