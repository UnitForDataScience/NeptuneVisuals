In detail the incidence of all fungal genera identified in A. donax and P. nigra biomass was 1 while in E. camaldulensis biomass Penicillium strongly dominated the eukaryotic biodiversity showing a relative abundance of 3.2 1.eggNOG and KEGG functional profiling of lignocellulosic biomass.

The com- position of prokaryotic and eukaryotic subpopulations within the biomass were also separately assessed and presented below.In total sixteen different bacterial genera with an incidence 1 were detected in the biomass materials but only Streptomyces Pseudomonas Agrobacterium Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas were detected in all samples 1.

Among the forty-two genera occurring with an abundance 1 in at least one sample only Pestalotiopsis was recovered in all lignocellulosic biomasses with an incidence of 2.7 2.0 and 12.50 in A. donax E. camaldulensis and P. nigra respectively 5B.Overall the highest fungal biodiversity related to GHs was found in E. camaldulensis 35 genera followed by A. donax 13 genera and P. nigra 5 genera.

By contrast in A. donax biomass most of the GHs were related to Fusarium 18.6 Nectria 14.2 and Trichoderma 12.4 while the abundance of the other taxa range approximately from 8 to 1 5B.Finally the lowest fungal diversity was found in P. nigra biomass.

In particular a number of 1059 in A. donax corresponding to 59.1 on total CAZymes and to 0.7 on total ORFs detected 750 in Eucalyptus camaldulensis corresponding to 58.6 on total CAZymes and to 0.3 on total ORFs detected and 1136 in Populus nigra corresponding to 53.8 on total CAZymes and to 1.9 on total ORFs detected predicted proteins were classified as GHs.

Sequence reads accounting for around 10.0 Gb for A. donax and E. camaldulensis samples and 2 Gb for P. nigra were selected T1.The reads were assembled into 95292 159184 and 33805 contigs cut-off value 500 bp for A. donax E. cama- ldulensis and P. nigra biomasses respectively T1.

The longest contig was 49245 650642 and 85030 bases in A. donax E. camaldulensis and P. nigra respectively T1.Microbial community composition of lignocellulosic biomasses.
