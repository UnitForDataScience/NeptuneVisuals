No diarrhealsymptoms were observed in control groups Negative control CR control Ant control and Ant  CR control.Effect of CR Supplementation on Clinical Score and Body Weight of C. difficile Infected MiceClinical scores of the individual animals in different groups were recorded using standard clinical score chart from 1DPI to 7 DPI Chen et al.

The statistical significance level was set at a P  0.05.RESULTSEffect of CR Supplementation on the Incidence of Diarrhea and Severity of C. difficile Infection in MiceIn order to assess the prophylactic effect of CR against C. difficile associated diarrhea in mice 8 mice per treatment group the animal diets were supplemented with CR at two different concentrations 0.05 and 0.1 in feed prior to antibiotic treatment and subsequent C. difficile infection Ant  CD  0.05 CR and Ant  CD  0.1 CRThe oral administration of 105 CFUml NAP1 C. difficile spores resulted in high morbidity and low mortality in infected mice.

Strikingly this alteration in the abundance of Proteobacteria Firmicutes Bacteriodetes and Verrucobacteria due to C. difficile infection was reversed significantly by CR supplementation as observed in the CR- treated and C. difficile infected groups Ant  CD  0.05 CR and Ant  CD  0.10 CR groups p  0.05.At the Order and Family level an increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was observed in antibiotic alone Antcontrol and C. difficile Ant  CD groups compared to negative control and CR control groups Figure 5.

This effect was significantly reversed by the supplementation of CR in Ant  CR control Ant  CD  0.5 CR and Ant  CD  0.5 CR groups.Inverse Simpson plot revealed a differential pattern of bacterial diversity in various treatment groups Figure 6.

A recent study from our laboratory suggested the potential use of CR as an anti-C. difficile therapeutic agent due to its inhibitory effect on C. difficile toxin production without affecting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria in vitro Mooyottu et al.

Previous studies have reported that supplementation of low doses of CR exerted no detrimental effects on endogenous bacterial populations including Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in pigs and poultry Jamroz et al.

2006.Previous studies conducted in our laboratory revealed that SICs of CR reduced C. difficile toxin production and cytotoxicity in Vero cells in vitro Mooyottu et al.

In addition our previous experiments showed an inhibition of C. difficile spore outgrowth in the presence of CR Mooyottu et al.

Surprisingly this beneficial shift brought about by CR treatment in the gut microbiome of antibiotic-treated and C.difficile infected animals is very much similar to that of human patients who have undergone fecal microbiome transplantation Weingarden et al.

These findings suggest the potential of CR as an anti- C. difficile agent however further clinical studies are warranted to confirm this.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSKV conceived the idea KV and SM designed the experiments and prepared the manuscripts SM GF and AU performed the experiments KM and IU analyzed the data.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis research was funded by United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture USDA- NIFA Critical and Emerging Food Safety Issues program Grant 2010-03567.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found REFERENCESAltman K.
