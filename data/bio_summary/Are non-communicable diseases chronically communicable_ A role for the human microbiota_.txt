such complementary strands of evidence may demonstrate if information about human microbiota can serve as prognostic markers for predicting clinical health outcomes and behaviour or as novel targets for new therapeutic and prevention strategies in clinical or public health practice.conflict of interest disclosuresthe author has no competing interests.fundingsupportthis work was supported by the uk national institutes for health research nihr health services and delivery research pro- gramme.

while much interest has recently been awakened that perturba- tions in gut microbiota are associated with the burden of antibiotic resistance  recent efforts investigating the potential causal effects or predictive value of information on the composition of microbiota or their metabolites e.g.

few out of sev- eral studies on microbiota metabolites or functions have conducted a formal quantification to support predictive utility of these phenotypes for ncds .so future lines of research need to focus on two hypotheses human microbiota or a panel of microbiota-related phenotypes would improve risk prediction or be causally associated with ncds.

trimethylamine n-oxide tmao in the circulation or their functions like changes in the gut-blood barrier gbb permeability will open new avenues of research .recently experimental studies demonstrated how administra- tion of akkermansia muciniphila one of the most abundant mem- bers of the human gut microbiota to mice can prevent the development of obesity and associated complications .

these find- ings were in line with previous evidence that microbiota transfer from adult male to female mice yielded in protection against dia- betes development .

there- fore the effect estimates for human genes biomarkers or inter- ventions obtained in the classical settings can be modified if one could take into account the transmission of human microbiota between people within a certain population .

given the fact that microbiome traits are considered heritable and the trait asso- ciations tend to be small  complementary evidence from an integrative analysis of how the host gene-environment interaction can influence diversity and structure of the human microbiome and vice versa may find right matched pieces of the puzzle in ncds.another aspect of research for microbiome-disease associations is to investigate whether additional information on the composi-tion and structure of the human microbiota is of value to improve the risk prediction for ncds.
