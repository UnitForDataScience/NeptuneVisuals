Relative abundances were calculated using normalised se- quence data to account for varying sequence depth between samples Phyloseq version 1.10.0.frozen VMG II and RNAprotect Bacteria.PhylumImmediately-frozen VMG II  RNAprotect Bacteria Alpha a diversityWe assessed whether the overall bacterial diversity differed between dental plaque samples frozen immediately to those stored at RT in ei- ther VMG II or RNAprotect Bacteria.

Of the two RT storage conditions tested only VMG II was able to preserve a similar phylo- genetic makeup to the immediately-frozen dental plaque.DiscussionWe have identified VMG II as a suitable medium for the storage of oral microbiome samples which are to be assessed with NGS in field-type conditions.

Positive log2-fold change values indicate enriched OTUs in the RNAprotect Bacteria dental plaque and negative log2-fold change values indicate enriched OTUs in the immediately-frozen plaque sam- ples.the dental plaque samples frozen immediately and the plaque stored at RT VMG II and RNAprotect Bacteria.

Whilst multiple DNA preservatives are available the two we investigated for RT preservation of oral microbial DNA were the viability preserving microbiostatic medium VMG II because it is designed for oral samples and RNAprotectr Bacteria Reagent Qiagen as RNA preservatives have been tested multiple times on gut micro- biome samples   and used in a large oral microbiome cohort study  but not as yet tested for preservation of oral biofilm samples.

Whilst this method would have resulted in some variability in the plaque picked up on each of the three swabs this would have been random between individuals with respect to storage condition allocation of the swab.Each of the triplicate swab samples taken per individual was stored under a different conditionSample 1Swab 1 was frozen immediately at -20 degC neat.Sample 2Swab 2 was stored in VMG II at RT for two weeks and then frozen at -20 degC.Sample 3Swab 3 was stored in RNAprotect Bacteria at RT for two weeks and then frozen at -20 degC.An alternative method to using three swabs to collect the whole mouth plaque sample would be to take one swab dispense the plaque into a liquid and aliquot the liquid to the different storage conditions.

RNAprotect Bacteria can be made into a semi-solid gel with the addition of agarose at 0.5 although it is unknown what impact this may have on the ability of RNAprotect Bacteria to preserve nucleic acids.To the best of our knowledge the suitability of either VMG II orRNAprotect Bacteria with agaragarose for RT stabilisation of DNA from oral microbiome samples has yet to be assessed using NGS.

The two methods while established as storage media for culture and Sanger sequencing have yet to be examined for their suitability to preserve oral microbial DNA for NGS.Genetic analysisGenetic analysis of the dental plaque samples n  24 included DNA extraction amplification of the 16S gene and pyrosequencing ofthese amplicons.DNA extractionAll dental plaque samples were extracted within three weeks of collection.

Furthermore our data does not reveal whether VMG II media accurately preserves other microbes such as Fungi and Archaea.ConclusionsWe found the VMG II medium to be a safe and cost effective solution to the issue of stabilising microbial DNA at RT for dental plaque sam- ples.

Our results provide a new method for RT storage of dental plaque samples intended for microbiome analysis.Materials and methodsPopulationWe assessed the effect of storage conditions on dental plaque sam- ples taken from eight Australian children.
