Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample and then the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced.Correspondence to Dr. Taiji Ogawa Department of ProsthodonticsAlpha diversity in terms of operational taxonomic unit richness was significantly higher in samples from the non-DM group than in those from the HC group.

Furthermore in the DM group Actinomyces and Selenomonas showed signifi- cantly higher abundance whereas Alloprevotella showed significantly lower abundance relative to the non-DM group.

OTU richness observed OTUs andChao index was significantly higher in samples from the non-DM group than in those from the HC group Fig.

A microbial diversity estimator Shannon index also indicated a significantly more diverse bacterial commu- nity in the non-DM group than in the HC group Fig.

The DM group showed a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroidetes than the non-DM group Fig.

In the samples obtained from the DM group Actinomyces and Selenomonas were significantly more abundant whereas Alloprevotella showed lower abundance than in the non-DM group.

In addition Actinomyces Rothia Fillifactor Selenomonas and Synergistes showed significantly higher abundance whereas Virgibacillus Abiotrophia Veillonella and Fusobacterium showed significantly lower abundance in the non-DM group than in the HC group Figs.

Weighted UniFrac distance analysis showed that salivary microbial communities in the DM group were separately clustered.

Although our findings were limited by the small sample size oral bacterial diversity in the DM group was clearly different from that in the non-DM group.Keywords salivary microbiota diabetes dysbiosis 16S rRNA sequencing nursing home.Gerodontology and Oral Rehabilitation Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry 1-8 Yamadaoka Suita Osaka565-0871 JapanFax 81-6-6879-2957 E-mail J-STAGE Advance Publication October 6 2017Color figures can be viewed in the online issue at J-STAGE.
