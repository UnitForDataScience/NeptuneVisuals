Strain Marseille- P3835T is the type strain of 'Virgibacillus ndiopensis' ndiop.en'sisFIG.

Because all the strains exhibited a 16S rRNA sequence homology of 98.7 with their phylogenetically closest species we thus propose the creation of these three new species according to the nomenclature .

Strain Marseille-P3801T is the type strain of the new species 'Gracilibacillus phocaeensis' pho.ca.een'sis N.L.

Strain Marseille-P3518T is the type strain of the new species Sediminibacillus massiliensis ma.si.lien'sis L. masc.

from massiliensis related to the university hospital in Marseille France where the strain was isolated.Strain Marseille-P3835T was isolated from in stool samples 3.7 NaCl of a 11-year-old boy from N'Diop.

On the basis of this result we propose to classify 'Virgibacillus ndiopensis' as a new representative of the Virgibacillus genus belonging to the family Bacillaceae of the phylum Firmicutes.
