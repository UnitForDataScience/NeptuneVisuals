this process is dependent on hepatic induction of cytochrome p450 family 7 subfamily b polypeptide 1 cyp7b1 and results in increased plasma levels as well as fecal excretion of bile acids that is accompanied by distinct changes in gut microbiota and increased heat production.genetic and pharmacological interventions that targeted the synthesis and biliary excretion of bile acids prevented the rise in fecal bile acid excretion changed the bacterial composition of the gut and modulated thermogenic responses.

on the one hand the gut bacteria modify bile acids through both dehydroxy- lation to form secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid dca and through deconjungation via the enzymatic activity of bile salt hydrolases.

taken together these data demonstrate both accelerated lipoprotein processing in bat and increased cholesterol transport from thermogenic adipose tissues toward the liver which is consistent with previous studies.to determine the fate of cholesterol we measured bile acid levels inthe liver by quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to mass spec- trometry lc-ms. we observed that the levels of most of the unconju- gated bile acid uba  and conjugated bile acid cba  species were significantly higher in the cold-housed mice than in the warm-housed control mice and noted that the most prominent induc- tions were for cholic acid ca ursodeoxycholic acid udca and muricholic acids mcas.

in conclusion these data reveal that under conditions of bat activa- tion the alternative pathway is selectively upregulated and increases bile acid synthesis.cold accelerates fecal bile acid excretion via cyp7b1to further explore the fate of bile acids we quantified their levels in stool samples from warm-housed and cold-housed mice.

taken together these data argue against diminished cba re-uptake capacity as a cause for higher fecal bile acid levels.another mechanism for increased fecal concentrations of cba could be due to reduced bile acid deconjungation by bile salt hydrolases bshs which are expressed by a number of gut bacteria.

in contrast the fecal bile acid concentrations of ez-treated mice were not higher after cold exposure and bile acid levels were almost identical to those inab10008002500warmccold60040020002000150010005000uba cbacold wild type cold cyp7b1--017d2000wt coldcyp7b1-- colde4000aav-gfp aav-cyp7b1fwarmghcold2.0warmcold250warm cold150010005003000200010001.51.00.555 mr kda40 mr kda20015010050000.00ubacbahousing temperature degcslc10a2uba cbaiwarmjklmcold6420warm ab cold ab8000600040002000 warmcoldwarm ab0.080.060.040.02cold ab10080604020uba cba01190uba cba0.00bshactivity0taurinefigure 3 cold exposure promotes fecal excretion of cyp7b1-derived bile acids.

alternatively cholesterol is secreted into bile either in an unmodifiedform or after its conversion into bile acids.

bile acids can also be formed by the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway which is initiated by the action of sterol 27-hydroxylase encoded by cyp27a1 followed by 25-hydroxycholes- terol 7-a-hydroxylase encoded by cyp7b1.

bile acids also stimulate signaling at the plasma membrane via the g-protein-cou- pled bile acid receptor 1 gpbar1 also known as tgr5 thereby regulating diverse metabolic pathways.

moreover in both mice and humans bile acids increase energy expenditure via the stimulation of tgr5 on brown adipocytes which suggests a role of liver-derived bile acids as regulators of adaptive thermogenesis.bile acids show mutual interactions with gut microbiota.

cholesterol homeostasis was achieved by the stimulation of lipoprotein flux increased bile acid synthesis via the alternative pathway and massive fecal excretion of conjugated bile acids which ultimately shaped the gut microbiome and promoted adaptive thermogenesis in a cold environment.resultscold alters the gut microbiomedietary composition is a determinant of the gut microbiome and cold exposure requires higher food intake to meet the increased energy demands for thermogenesis.
