We suggest that future studies incorporate NR activity assessments with other measures of nitrite formation NO-signaling end points to evaluate these key questions.Additional salient considerations regarding measuring NR ac- tivity ex vivo include observations that nitrite may be formed before addition of nitrate requiring its subtraction from nitrate- dependent increases in nitrite.

This sample showed no change in nitrite formation after addition of nitrate but nitrite levels were at 1 mM suggesting that either nitrate-reductase activity was extremely low no nitrate- dependent change in nitrite or extremely high with complete reduction of added nitrate to nitrite within time taken to mix and sample the first point.

Nitrate-supplementation increased nitrite  two-fold relative to control which was prevented in chlorohexidine treated mice.Altered NR activity after exposure to inhaled irritants and toxicantsDeveloping an NR activity assay may facilitate testing of whether this component of the enterosalivary nitrate-reduction cycle varies in different pathophysiological settings.

Future studies evaluating the impact of varied NR activities on nitrate-dependent nitrite forma- tion and subsequent NO-bioavailability are required to assess whether ex vivo NR activity could be an effective biomarker for the functionality of the enterosalivary nitrate-reduction circuit.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the CounterACT Program Na- tional Institutes of Health Office of the Director and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Grant Number U01ES023759 U01 ES02645802 and 1U01ES027697-01.Appendix A.

A shows that the NR activity in smokers was decreased 70 whereas bacterial number was higher B. NR activity per CFU was almost 90 lower in smokers compared to non-smokers C.To test if exposure to reactive substances inhibits NR activity in mice we used a Br2 gas exposure model as recently described .

Nitrate reductase activity was calculated by normalizing initial rates of nitrite formation with corresponding colony forming units.Mouse and rat nitrate reductase activityInitial studies failed to show detectable changes in nitrite for- mation after nitrate addition to freshly collected mouse or rat tongue swabs.

1A shows that nitrate addition led to a time dependent increase in nitrite formationminimal changes in nitrite were observed with vehicle control.

1B shows the nitrate-dependent nitrite for- mation at lower initial concentrations and also demonstrates sig- nificant nitrite formation at the lowest 100 mM nitrate concentration tested.

Based on experimental sensitivity to discern changes in nitrite reported levels of nitrate in the saliva and to ensure nitrate-dependent nitrite formation was in the linear range we chose 1 mM nitrate as a dose to test further.

Also in some cases time depen- dent formation of nitrite appeared to be autocatalytic for both human and mouse samples which was most evident after 30min incubation resulting in increases in nitrite levels greater than the amount of nitrate added e.g.
