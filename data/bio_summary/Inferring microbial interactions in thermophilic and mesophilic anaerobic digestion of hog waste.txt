The The relative abundance of microorganisms in the BRP group.

The thermophilic interaction network showed a very different profile of influential microbial mem- bers than those of the mesophilic network.

The digesters were operated at two differ- ent temperatures mesophilic 37C and thermophilic 55C using 15 days hydraulic retention time HRT and 5 total solids TS without pH control.

The mean value of relative abundance xik for an OTU i is defined below.MEANi 14t k141dxikThd1ThNdxik  0ThDifferential OTUs between mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic reactors were selected by the following steps.

The percentage of archaeal sequences 8.3-13.1 at mesophilic temperature was higher than in the thermophilic conditions 2.2-7.9 especially after per- forming GCN correction .

The estimated number of OTUs was apparently lower under thermophilic conditions although the sequencing depth was higher.

The interaction networks identified at mesophilic A or thermophilic B temperatures.

The other four members which were distinct between mesophilic and thermophilic processes Flavobacteriaceae Methanocor- pusculaceae Ruminococcaceae and Methanomicrobiaceaei had concordant topological prop- erties such as a smaller node size with a dark red color these were regulated by a variety ofmicroorganisms but rarely influenced others.

The results suggested that the inferred microbial interactions were supported by the measurement using their metabolic properties.DiscussionThe aim of our study was to use deep sequencing technology to investigate the interactions in microbial communities in mesophilic or thermophilic reactors generating biogas from hog waste.
