Comparative metagenomic analysis between endophytes phytopathogens rhizosphere bacteria and soil bacteria together with metagenomic analysis of the rice roots show that endophytes possess prominent features and metabolic processes important if not required for endophytic lifestyle including flagella or motility mech- anisms plant-polymer degrading enzymes iron seques- tration and storage and scavenging or detoxification of reactive oxygen species .ConclusionsThe findings of the study not only support the use of seed bacterial endophytes as potential plant growth promoters but also give an overview of the general physiological fea- tures important for endophytic lifestyle especially in the seeds.

These include prominent features such as flagella or motility mechanism plant- polymer degrading enzymes protein secretory systems iron chelation acquisition and storage quorum sensing ROS detoxification and other characteristics probably involved in the entire nitrogen cycle  Furthermore comparative genomics of traits relevant to plant colonization and establishment of symbionts phytopathogens rhizo- sphere bacteria and soil bacteria show that there are putative properties that are significantly observed in endophytes compared to other types of bacteria interacting with plantsconfirming those features studied by Sessitsch et al.

The communities of rice bac- terial endophytes were also seen to actively respond to the changes in the environmental conditions of their host and that bacterial adaptation as well as plant host factors affect the overall community structure of endophytes resid- ing in different rice cultivars There have been numerous reports on indigenous endophytic bacteria in various plants and plant tissues.

These major groups of bacteria were also seen as important members of the root endosphere Combining results of 16S rRNA and BOX PCR show that the closest reference strains of the isolated bacteria Microbacterium Flavobacterium Xanthomonas Kosakonia Paenibacillus from the seed potentially belong to the same bacterial species but may have genetic differ- ences up to the subspecies level as they form subclusters within their own groups Many of the bacterial isolates also have high similarities with reference strains that were originally isolated as rice-associated bacteria Additional file  Table S3.

Aside from the generally observed traits of seed endophytes the bi-plot ordination of principal com- ponent analysis from 49 isolates reveals prominent distin- guishing traits of several groups of rice seed bacterial endophytes.

It has also been observed that some endophytes could migrate from the internal tissues to the external surface of the plants and even to the soil and that several members of the seed endophytic community could colonize the rhizosphere and the surrounding soil During this time phosphate solubilization may become important in the rhizosphere region of the roots.Bacterial endophytes of rice seeds have prominent func- tional traits potentially important for their endophytic life- style and host adaptation 59.

Plants are in- ternally inhabited by plant-associated bacteria known as endophytes which directly influence the host plant cells mediating responses as a result of interactions without damaging the host or eliciting strong defense responses .

Despite differences in ecological niches plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria PGPR that are free-living and endophytic bacteria utilize some of the same mecha- nisms to directly and indirectly promote plant growth - Plant hosts on the other hand may also confer a selective advantage over endophytes that show beneficial associations.

The seeds are also shown to be sources of endophytic bacteria of the rice plant and that rice seed bacterial endophytes rapidly colonize the roots then the shoots of developing riceplants indicating their endosphere competence in terms of colonization survival and even transmission to the next generation hosts.

On the other hand most of the isolated seed bacterial endophytes in this study were also observed in other studies on rice endo- phytes though they were not isolated in all the cultivars studied suggesting that these bacteria are widespread in the rice and that they are well adapted to the rice niche.
