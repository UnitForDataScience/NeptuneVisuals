rice plants were also observed to be colonized by consistent groups of siderophore-producing bacteria such as pantoea in differ- ent plant parts and in different growth stages 57. it has also been observed that some endophytes could migrate from the internal tissues to the external surface of the plants and even to the soil and that several members of the seed endophytic community could colonize the rhizosphere and the surrounding soil during this time phosphate solubilization may become important in the rhizosphere region of the roots.bacterial endophytes of rice seeds have prominent func- tional traits potentially important for their endophytic life- style and host adaptation 59. our study showed that majority of the seed endophytes are capable of producing cellulase 92 and pectinase 96 which was also observed by elbetagy et al.

comparative metagenomic analysis between endophytes phytopathogens rhizosphere bacteria and soil bacteria together with metagenomic analysis of the rice roots show that endophytes possess prominent features and metabolic processes important if not required for endophytic lifestyle including flagella or motility mech- anisms plant-polymer degrading enzymes iron seques- tration and storage and scavenging or detoxification of reactive oxygen species .conclusionsthe findings of the study not only support the use of seed bacterial endophytes as potential plant growth promoters but also give an overview of the general physiological fea- tures important for endophytic lifestyle especially in the seeds.

the communities of rice bac- terial endophytes were also seen to actively respond to the changes in the environmental conditions of their host and that bacterial adaptation as well as plant host factors affect the overall community structure of endophytes resid- ing in different rice cultivars there have been numerous reports on indigenous endophytic bacteria in various plants and plant tissues.

aside from the generally observed traits of seed endophytes the bi-plot ordination of principal com- ponent analysis from 49 isolates reveals prominent distin- guishing traits of several groups of rice seed bacterial endophytes.

plants are in- ternally inhabited by plant-associated bacteria known as endophytes which directly influence the host plant cells mediating responses as a result of interactions without damaging the host or eliciting strong defense responses .

as the plant endosphere niche presents a unique habitat bacterial endophytes are likely to have differential functions specialization adaptations and com- petence  .

metagenomic analysis of sequences from bacterial endophytes of rice roots predicted properties and metabolic processes im- portant for endophytic lifestyle.

these include prominent features such as flagella or motility mechanism plant- polymer degrading enzymes protein secretory systems iron chelation acquisition and storage quorum sensing ros detoxification and other characteristics probably involved in the entire nitrogen cycle  furthermore comparative genomics of traits relevant to plant colonization and establishment of symbionts phytopathogens rhizo- sphere bacteria and soil bacteria show that there are putative properties that are significantly observed in endophytes compared to other types of bacteria interacting with plantsconfirming those features studied by sessitsch et al.

despite differences in ecological niches plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria pgpr that are free-living and endophytic bacteria utilize some of the same mecha- nisms to directly and indirectly promote plant growth - plant hosts on the other hand may also confer a selective advantage over endophytes that show beneficial associations.

added that bacterial endophytes also pos- sess other plant growth promoting abilities such as nitrogen fixation phosphate solubilization and iron chelation.

the seeds are also shown to be sources of endophytic bacteria of the rice plant and that rice seed bacterial endophytes rapidly colonize the roots then the shoots of developing riceplants indicating their endosphere competence in terms of colonization survival and even transmission to the next generation hosts.

however studies on bacterial endophytes inhabiting rice seeds together with their putative endophytic functional traits and plant growth promotion are few most especially on specific cultivars that are anthropogenically selected based on their potential commercial or special applica- tions.

in addition the roles of seed endophytes in germination and plant growth promotion pgp that may allow them to be selectively chosen by plants were also studied.methodsseed samplesall seeds used in this study were taken from rural develop- ment administration rda south korea.

nested pcr was performed to amplify nifh gene in bacterial endophytes.
