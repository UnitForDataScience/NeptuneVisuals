data analysis was performed using spss version 20 spss inc. chicago il.692resultsall the clinical characteristics were comparable between infants with colic and those with normal amounts of crying 1. in colic infants the mean standard deviation total crying time was 303 116 minutes per day comprising 151 81 minutes of fussing and 152 62 minutes of crying per day.the infants with colic showed significantly higher serum concentrations of il-8 mcp-1 and mip-1b than the controls p 0.001 p 0.003 and p 0.026 respectively as shown in 2. furthermore the serum concentrations of tnf-a tended to be higher in infants with colic than in controls p 0.072. there were however no statistically significant differences in the serum concentrations of il-1b il-6 il-10 ifn-g i-fabp cxcl16 and zonulin between the infants with colic and the controls 2. fecal numbers of c leptum correlated negatively with the proinflammatory markers mcp-1 r0.44 p 0.02 mip-1b r0.43 p 0.02 and tnf-a r0.38 p 0.04. inaddition the c coccoides group correlated negatively with mcp- 1 r 0.43 p 0.02 and b breve positively with cxcl16 r 0.38 p 0.04. there were no other statistically significant correlations between the analyzed immunological biomarkers and gut microbiota data not shown.discussionin the present study we evaluated sera of infants with colic and healthy infants with the goal to uncover possible immunological biomarkers that are associated with crying due to colic and thus provide a new insight into the immunopathogenesis of infantile colic.

neither could we find abnormal serum zonulin concentrations associated with infantile colic which contradicts the notion of a zonulin- dependent loss of enterocytic barrier function in these children there is accumulating evidence that the gut microbiota composition of infants with colic differs from that in healthy infants infants with colic have shown to have more proteobacteria and less bifidobacteria and lactobacillus than do healthy controls in the study population of infants with colic we demon- strated a negative association between proinflammatory biomarkers and c leptum and c coccoides the major constituents of the normal colonic microbiota earlier studies have shown that c leptum and c coccoides group bacteria play an important role in main- taining the overall balance of the gut microbiota and in promoting maturation of the immune system possibly through their induction amplification and programming of regulatory t cells inresults are given as mean standard deviation sd or as number  of subjects.comparisons were made using a chi-square test an independent samples t test or mann-whitney u test as appropriate.693young mice oral inoculation of clostridium spp.

the finding contracting this hypothesis more common use of probiotics by colic infants is probably explained by a selection bias that is colic infants were given probiotics more often than infants with normal amounts of crying due to previous studies supporting the supple- mentation in the former group 10. furthermore the probiotic supplementation was stopped at least 1 to 2 weeks before the samples were taken to avoid this possible confounding effect.to conclude we demonstrated here that colic crying is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation possibly due to an aberrant gut microbiota composition.

humans and microbes interact bidirectionally within the gastrointestinal tract and beyond to exchange endocrine immune and neural signals to target metabolic immune humoral and neural pathways both microbial dysbiosis and low-grade inflammation a possible sequel of the former should be taken into account when selecting specific strains of the gut microbiota as a tool for reprogramming the host- microbe interaction in infants with colic.acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the families participating in our study liisa lehtonen phd for help with the planning of the study ulla-maija eriksson rn for help with the follow-up of participants riikka lankinen ms for all the serum analysis and method description lauri polari phd for cytokine and chemokine assays and for their method description and aura professional english consulting ltd.  694 referenceswake m morton-allen e poulakis z et al.

studies have demonstrated a higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor a tnf-a interleukin 1b il-1b il-6 and lower concen- trations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in blood samples of patients with fgid compared with controls furthermorejpgn  volume 64 number 5 may 2017691chemokines in serum such as il-8 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1b mip-1b and chemokine c-x-c motif ligand 16 cxcl16 have shown to be elevated in patients with fgid compared with controls .to the best our knowledge there is no data available on immune mediators in infants with colic and therefore we conducted a study to evaluate whether low-grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability could be found in infants with colic.

written informed consent was obtained from the infants' parents.study objectives and outcomesthe primary outcome of the present study was the difference in inflammatory biomarkers between colic and healthy control infants.

correlation between immunological biomarkers and intes- tinal microbiota composition in colic infants was analyzed as a secondary outcome.study populationthe study population consists of 28 infants with colic participating in an ongoing randomized double-blind placebo- controlled study involving l rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 inter- vention  the reference population comprised 12 healthy matched by mode of delivery and feeding type controls from an ongoing prospective follow-up study that records infant behavior patterns eg crying sleeping feeding.

the infants of the reference popu- lation were healthy term noncolic infants born in the same hospital and not exposed to probiotics or antibiotics during the neonatal period.blood sample collection and processingperipheral venous blood samples were collected at the age of 3 to 5 weeks from the study population.

in particular dysbiosis together with low-grade inflammation during critical stages of development induces lasting alterations in the immune and metabolic phenotype and may increase the risk to develop noncommunicable diseases later in life infants with colic have earlier been demonstrated to have elevated concentrations of fecal calprotectin a biomarker of intes- tinal neutrophilic infiltration in accordance with that we found increased concentrations of serum il-8 a potent neutrophil chemoattractant in infants with colic.

based on that it is interesting to note that the traditional probiotic l reuteri dsm 17938 a potent treatment strategy for infantile colic has been shown to reduce the serum concentrations of mcp-1 and il-8 and thus possibly reducing the proposed infant colic-associated inflammation serum concentrations of i-fabp an enter- ocyte-derived biomarker of intestinal damage associated with necrotizing enterocolitis and celiac disease were similar between infants with colic and the healthy infants arguing against enterocytic injury in the pathogenesis of infantile colic.
