The airway microbiota at different disease stagesCulture-independent analyses of lung tissue specimens obtained at the time of transplant demonstrate a relatively homogenous population of typical CF pathogens with the dominant organisms reflecting thosefound in contemporaneous sputum cultures.4750 matched lung sputum and upper airway samples the same dominant organism was recovered from lung and sputum albeit with increased microbial diversity in the latter while the microbiota of the upper airways was discordant.47 specimens from a 3-year-old child with CF obtained at lobectomy for severe localized disease demonstrated a diverse heterogeneous bacterial population which correlated poorly with the species identified on conventional culture of both BAL fluid and oropharyngeal swabs suggesting that microbial diversity persists even in severely affected children and raising more questions regarding the optimal sample type for identifying airway microbiota in early CF lung disease.Further studies of adults with CF suggest an association between microbial diversity in the lower airway clinical stability and higher pulmonary function.4852 and 13 inpatients experiencing an acute exacerbation median age in both groups 27.5 years median forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1 56 and 27 predicted in outpatient and inpatient groups respectively found that bacterial diversity was significantly higher and the relative abundance of Streptococcus Gemella and Haemophilus genera was increased in the outpatient group although adjustment was not made for current or recent antibiotic exposure.53 restriction fragment length polymorphism T-RFLP analysis of monthly sputum samples collected over a 12-month period from 14 adults mean FEV1 49.1 - 17 predicted pulmonary function was related positively to the number of species per sample and negatively to the rank abundance slope and the relative abundance of P. aeruginosa.

In chronic respiratory disease it has been suggested that instability or dysbiosis in the airway microbiota is antecedent to pulmonary exacerbation and that such changes in the host-microbiome relationship may further contribute to developing lung disease.15-18 The airway microbiota in infancy and early childhoodThe initial neonatal microbiota reflects the mode of delivery but is undifferentiated across multiple body habitats.1920 airway microbiota of healthy infants has not been described numerous studies highlight the dynamic nature of the nasopharyngeal microbiota.

Upper airway samples are unlikely to be completely representative of the lower airway microbiota and as such current understanding of the healthy lower airway microbial ecosystem and ofthe changes that occur in disease is limited.

Substantial changes in individuals' lower airway microbiota over time have been described but the association with clinical outcomes remains uncer- tain.74 advanced CF lung disease is less diverse than that of those with milder disease and indeed in end-stage CF the lower airway microbiota is composed almost entirely of one to two well-recognized pathogens.Further longitudinal studies where individuals serve as their own controls combined with improved descriptions and understanding of the ontogeny of the healthy lung microbiome during infancy and early childhood are required to improve our understanding how airway microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.

Numerous studies using both extended microbiological culture and molecular analysis techniques have reported the frequent presence of obligate and facultative anaerobes in CF airway specimens and there are now cross-sectional descriptions of the airway microbiota at various stages of CF lung disease.

Such exploratory studies are needed to begin from early infancy since infants with CF may develop structural lung disease as young as 3 month of age following their diagnosis by newborn screening.4 tion of the lower airway microbiota in non-expectorating infants and young children is limited by requiring bronchoscopy under general anesthesia to obtain appropriate samples.Understanding the composition and structure of the airway microbiota in healthy infants and children is also critical for interpreting changes that occur in disease.

Sampling methodsA recent study focusing on children with chronic respiratory symptoms secondary to either protracted bacterial bronchitis orchronic suppurative lung disease highlighted the importance of lower airway samples in defining the respiratory microbiota and its contribution to health and disease.36 gene sequencing results from oropharyngeal nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage BAL specimens from 68 children with chronic lung disease and 10 disease-controls undergoing investigation for congenital stridor median age 2.2 years across all groups the microbial composition of the combined upper airway samples was at least 50 similar to the paired BAL samples in only 69 of subjects.

Initial metagenomic analyses suggest that despite taxonomic differences there are functional similarities between the airway microbiota of individuals with CF37 lung may share similar metabolic profiles Tables 1-3.38 The lower airway microbiota in children with CFDifferences between the microbiota in the lower airways of healthy children and those with CF are evident from early childhood.

In addition Pseudo- monas and Staphylococcus were detected in higher relative abundance in lower airway samples compared with those from the upper airway although analyses did not adjust for subject age.
