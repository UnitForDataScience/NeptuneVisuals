Our results will provide important preliminary data for the design completion of a defini- tive paediatric trial with a larger sample size and power calculation to attain statistical significance of our primary clinical outcomes in the future.This study and smaller paediatric trials by other investi- gators suggests the following FMT is an effective therapy in adult UC FMT is an effective therapy for paediatric UC donor selection has a significant role in optimising thera- peutic response and there may be differences in response between patients with duration of disease 1 year versus1 year.

For these reasons a large randomised single- blind placebo-controlled trial in paediatric UC patients who typically have a shorter disease duration using an anonymous donor will be scientifically and clinically valu- able.The aim of this paper was to describe the first randomised-controlled protocol for FMT in a paediatric IBD population.study objectivesThe objective of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of FMT for the therapy of paediatric UC.

Currently this trial is open to paediatric UC and patients with IBD-U experiencing symptoms of clinical or mucosal inflammation who would like to abstain from escalation of therapy or surgical interventions.A previous randomised-controlled trial for FMT in adult UC demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of FMT 938 24 vs 237 5 at inducing UC remission with no significant difference in adverse events between the groups.A second positive randomised-controlled trial for FMT in adult UC was recently published showing statistically significant benefits of FMT versus normal saline placebo at inducing steroid-free clinical remission 1841 44 vs 840 23 clinical response 2241 54 vs 940 23 and endoscopic response 1341 32 vs 440 10.This study will use a similar 6-week approach with the two time per week enema administrations instead of one time per week.

No other paediatric Gastroenterology sites in Canada are currently offering FMT trials for paediatric UC thus patients referred from outside centres for entry into our study will be considered if they meet eligibility criteria.outcoME MEAsurE AnAlysIsPUCAI MRE Magnetic Resonance EnterographyEligibility criteriaPaediatric patients aged 3-17 years with UC and IBD-unclassified IBD-U subtype are eligible for the study.

This pilot study will built on the FMT in adult UC trial recently completed at our centre.We will assess the feasibility of delivering two times per week faecal enemas from anonymous faecal microbial donors to patients with paediatric UC.

Pilot data will also be submitted to international conferences and published in peer-review journals.FuturE dIrEctIonsOn the basis of the results of this study future double- blind randomised placebo-controlled trials of FMT in paediatric IBD may involvePrimary outcomes Evaluation of efficacy of FMT at inducing clinical re- mission in new-onset UC or Crohn's disease.

A recent systematic review showed that over 90 of patients with recurrent C. difficile infection have been cured with FMT.These results have since been replicated in larger studies worldwide and strongly implicate colonic bacteria as a potential therapy for other gastrointestinal disease conditions.Four small case series have demonstrated success of FMT for paediatric inflammatory bowel disease IBD.

Approximately 104000 Canadians are affected by UC and Canada has among the highest incidence in the world.A diag- nosis of UC can be debilitating in childhood.

Chronic diseases can have significant impacts on children and UC may particularly affect childhood growth and development.Long- term immunosuppression is often required and paediatric patients may face higher lifetime rates of lymphoma and infection given their longer duration of illness.
