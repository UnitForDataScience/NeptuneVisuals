currently this trial is open to paediatric uc and patients with ibd-u experiencing symptoms of clinical or mucosal inflammation who would like to abstain from escalation of therapy or surgical interventions.a previous randomised-controlled trial for fmt in adult uc demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of fmt 938 24 vs 237 5 at inducing uc remission with no significant difference in adverse events between the groups.a second positive randomised-controlled trial for fmt in adult uc was recently published showing statistically significant benefits of fmt versus normal saline placebo at inducing steroid-free clinical remission 1841 44 vs 840 23 clinical response 2241 54 vs 940 23 and endoscopic response 1341 32 vs 440 10.this study will use a similar 6-week approach with the two time per week enema administrations instead of one time per week.

routine laboratory protocols and assays for obtaining and measuring samples will be followed.clinical disease activity scores will be determined based on a history obtained at each clinical assessment two times per week on weeks 0-6 once on weeks 18 and 30 or over the telephone on non-clinical assessment days weeks 12 and 24. the internationally validated pucai score will be used to objectively assess clinical disease activity.stool samples will be collected for microbiome analysis and faecal calprotectin weeks 0 3 6 12 18 24 and 30 to assess patterns of bacterial community structure associatedpucai paediatric ulcerative colitis activity index.with intestinal inflammation.

our results will provide important preliminary data for the design completion of a defini- tive paediatric trial with a larger sample size and power calculation to attain statistical significance of our primary clinical outcomes in the future.this study and smaller paediatric trials by other investi- gators suggests the following fmt is an effective therapy in adult uc fmt is an effective therapy for paediatric uc donor selection has a significant role in optimising thera- peutic response and there may be differences in response between patients with duration of disease 1 year versus1 year.
