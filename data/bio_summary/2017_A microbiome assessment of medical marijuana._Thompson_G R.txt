the fungal commu- nities assessed by internal transcribed spacer gene sequence analysis and the bacterial communities from 16s srna gene were analysed using published methods e. more specific whole metagenome analyses were used to better understand the presence of distinct species within the microbiome .internal transcribed spacer analysis resulted in 4000 total fungal taxonomic classifications.

whole metagenome sequence reads from sample mj150-008 n 658 indicated the presence of aspergillus fumigatus cryptococcus laurentii and mucor circinelloides all well- known causes of invasive fungal infections in immunocompro- mised hosts.we found numerous gram-negative bacilli and fungal patho- gens contaminating medical marijuana.

using both 16sinternal transcribed spacer community analysis and metagenomics approaches we sought to define the potential infectious risks of marijuana.twenty cannabis samples from different dispensaries in north- ern california were collected by steep hill laboratories berkeley ca and catalogued and their dna was extracted using the power- soil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad ca.

of the 20 fungal genera observed at 0.1 frequency many were genera that contain opportunistic pathogens e.g.
