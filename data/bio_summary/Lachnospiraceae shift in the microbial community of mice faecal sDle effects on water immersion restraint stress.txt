The IFN-g levels in the serum showed obvious differences between the normal mice and the stress groups in 2 and 4 weeks p  0.0019 p  0.01 p  0.004 p  0.01.

The stress group contained 32742-42261 reads with different OTUs ranging from 148 to 191 showed no obviously differences p  0.1474 p  0.05 p  0.5368 p  0.05 compared with the control group contained 29176-33304 reads and had OTUS ranging from 153 to 192.

Significant differences are expressed as p  0.05 p  0.01 and p  0.001.ResultsThe establishment and assessment of the WIRS mice model The WIRS model was established and assessed by the abnormal indices including behaviour pathology and the level of corticosterone IFN-g and IL-17 in the serum after 2 weeks between the control and the WIRS group.

The identification of 367205 sam- plessequences minimum sampling depth by the alphaTable 1 Table of alpha-diversity analysisData are expressed as the mean - SEM n  5 p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001diversity analysis was sparse.

Therefore CORT levels were significantly higher in the mice exposed to stress compared to the normal group in 2 and 4 weeks p  0.002 p  0.01 p  0.004 p  0.01.

c increased with stress and showed obvious differences compared with the normal group p  0.0013 p  0.01 p  0.009 p  0.01.

Thus the overall level of bacterial diver- sity between the WIRS group and the control was not dif- ferent p  0.5961 p  0.05 p  0.9727 p  0.05 for the two groups Shannon and Simpson index.

There was no obvious difference in the rarefaction curve trend and the Shannon curve between the WIRS and control groups p  0.0513 p  0.05 p  0.0524 p  0.05.

We found that the Spe- caccum accumulation and the relative abundance curves were not different between the WIRS and control sam- ples p  0.0542 p  0.05 p  0.0563 p  0.05.

The Simpson diversity index and the richness ACE values were higher in the stress samples than the control at all levels of computing systems devel- opment p  0.7362 p  0.05.
