For genes that were not assigned KO numbers the default features are pre- dicted in GenBank.The bold text indicate genes that were significantly up-regulated fold-change 2.0 during growth in medium containing 3C-GL or 6C-GL.which bifidobacterial genes are involved remain largely unknown.In this study we aimed to identify the genes responsible for the utilization of 3C-GL and 6C-GL in B. breve YIT 4014T.

GL-SBP1 displayed high affinity3'-GL50403020100K 2.04x10-5 M6'-GL50403020100K 2.92x10-4 Mtoward 6C-GL and 4C-GL but showed extremely low affinity towards 3C-GL 2b.Thus we assumed that 6C-GL was transported into bifido- bacterial cells via the ABC transporter GL-SBP1 and digested by GL-BG however this finding did not explain why the strain utilized 3C-GL efficiently .Involvement of another ABC transporter in 3C-GL-5050150250-10Time s4'-GL50-5050150250-10Time sLactose50utilizationTherefore we considered that another transport system may be responsible for 3C-GL utilization.

breve YIT 4014T can utilize these carbohydrates the strain showed the fastest growth with 3C-GL and the slowest growth with glucose.Genes induced upon 3C- and 6C-GL utilizationSubsequently we performed RNA sequencing RNA-Seq-10Time sConcentration of ligands-10Time sanalysis to identify which genes were up-regulated during growth in 3C-GL or 6C-GL as the sole carbon source.

Among genes with RPKM values 500 13 genes were found to be involved in sugar metabolism Table S2 shown in bold text.Based on their annotations we hypothesized that the gene locus BBBRRS 02305-02320 including b-galactosidase and an SBP type of ABC transporter is involved in GL utili- zation these genes were designated GL-BG and GL-SBP1 respectively  .

B. breve YIT 4014T genes highly expressed constitutively during growth in mPY medium supplemented with 3C-GL or glucose as the sole carbohydrateList derived from instances where the RPKM value was 10 000 among all genes.

All genes are represented by solid grey circles except for the putative GL utilization genes which are shown in red.

Target b-galactosidases final concentration 3.2 nM were dis- solved in Mcilvaine buffer pH 5.5 and incubated with lactose 3C-GL 4C-GL or 6C-GL final concentration01 mM at 37 C.

Because these strains can utilize 3C-GL efficiently data not shown they might employ alternative molecular machinery for 3C-GL uptake.ConclusionThe present findings improve our molecular understanding of prebiotic GOS utilization by bifidobacteria in the human gut.

Our data agreed well with these notable publications furthermore we found that these genes were involved in 3C- and 6C-GL utilization but not 4C-GL utilization.
