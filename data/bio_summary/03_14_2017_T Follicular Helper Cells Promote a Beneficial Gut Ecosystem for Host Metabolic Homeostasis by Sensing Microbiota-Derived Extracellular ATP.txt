The altered metabolic control we observed in P2rx7-- mice was worsened by a highfat diet which induced a significant increase in bodyand WAT weights as well as significantly impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with respect to WT littermates Figures S1C and S1D suggesting that P2rx7-- mice are more sensitive to increasedcaloric intake.Altered Microbiota Composition in P2rx7-- MiceHierarchical clustering of mice for cecal microbiota showed that P2rx7-- animals clustered together andseparately with respect to WT littermates Figure 1G.

Different from P2rx7-- mice serum insulin and insulin tolerance tests were not altered in both Icos-- and Icos--P2rx7-- mice with respect to WT mice Figures 3G-3H.

Food consumption was not different between the two strains of mice data not shown as were plasma total cholesterol 76.9 - 23.1 mgdL versus 66.5 - 17.5 mgdL in 9weekold WT and P2rx7-- animalsrespectively n  5 and plasma triglyceride levels 104.2 - 25.4 mgdL versus 95.4 - 14.9 mgdL in WT and P2rx7-- animals respectively.Macroscopic analysis at 9 weeks revealed liver enlargement weights WT 1.057 - 0.04 g P2rx7--1.346 - 0.038 g n  10 p  0.0006 that was associated with significantly elevated glycogen in fastedP2rx7-- compared with WT mice which exhibited only minimal scattered glycogen deposition Figure S1A.

Moreover quantification of SCFAs showed a significant increase in butyrate Figure 2F.Therefore P2rx7-- Tfh cells appear to be sufficient for determining the modifications in metabolicparameters and microbiota composition that were observed in P2rx7-- mice.Selective Role of Tfh Cells in Regulating Glucose MetabolismTo understand whether Tfh cell activity in P2rx7-- mice played a causative role in the development of metabolic syndrome by shaping the microbiota we compared Icos-- and Icos--P2rx7-- double mutantmice which are devoid of Tfh and GC B cells Figures S3A and S3B for microbiota composition and metabolic parameters.

Mice transplanted with microbiota from P2rx7-- mice gained significantly more weight compared with mice transplanted withbacteria from WT mice Figure 4F.

The analysis of variations in family abundances showed a significant increase in Lachnospiraceae a characteristic feature of P2rx7-- mice Figure 1H and of an undetermined family belonging to the order Clostridiales in P2rx7-- chimeric mice Figure 2E.

To understand whether the changes in the gut microbiota characteristic of P2rx7-- mice were the cause of the observed metabolic phenotype we transplanted cecal content isolated from P2rx7-- mice into VAMtreated WT animals.
