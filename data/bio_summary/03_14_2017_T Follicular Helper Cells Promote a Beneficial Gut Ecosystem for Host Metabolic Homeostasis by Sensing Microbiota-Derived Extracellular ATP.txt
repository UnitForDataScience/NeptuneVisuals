the altered metabolic control we observed in p2rx7-- mice was worsened by a highfat diet which induced a significant increase in bodyand wat weights as well as significantly impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with respect to wt littermates figures s1c and s1d suggesting that p2rx7-- mice are more sensitive to increasedcaloric intake.altered microbiota composition in p2rx7-- micehierarchical clustering of mice for cecal microbiota showed that p2rx7-- animals clustered together andseparately with respect to wt littermates figure 1g.

moreover quantification of scfas showed a significant increase in butyrate figure 2f.therefore p2rx7-- tfh cells appear to be sufficient for determining the modifications in metabolicparameters and microbiota composition that were observed in p2rx7-- mice.selective role of tfh cells in regulating glucose metabolismto understand whether tfh cell activity in p2rx7-- mice played a causative role in the development of metabolic syndrome by shaping the microbiota we compared icos-- and icos--p2rx7-- double mutantmice which are devoid of tfh and gc b cells figures s3a and s3b for microbiota composition and metabolic parameters.

food consumption was not different between the two strains of mice data not shown as were plasma total cholesterol 76.9 - 23.1 mgdl versus 66.5 - 17.5 mgdl in 9weekold wt and p2rx7-- animalsrespectively n  5 and plasma triglyceride levels 104.2 - 25.4 mgdl versus 95.4 - 14.9 mgdl in wt and p2rx7-- animals respectively.macroscopic analysis at 9 weeks revealed liver enlargement weights wt 1.057 - 0.04 g p2rx7--1.346 - 0.038 g n  10 p  0.0006 that was associated with significantly elevated glycogen in fastedp2rx7-- compared with wt mice which exhibited only minimal scattered glycogen deposition figure s1a.

2014. here we show that lack of p2x7mediated control of tfh cells results in altered microbiota composition that is responsible for impaired glucose homeostasis and enhanced fat deposition.resultsincreased body weight and impaired glucose metabolism in p2rx7-- micego toa characteristic trait of p2rx7-- mice is the increase in body weight with respect to wildtype wt littermates beaucage et al.

these data suggest that variations in selected families of the microbiota might result from deletion of p2rx7 and contribute to the observed altered glucose metabolism.cellintrinsic role of tfh cells in glucose homeostasisadoptive transfer of p2rx7-- tfh cells into lymphopenic mice results in enhanced expansion in pps with respect to wt cells proietti et al.

the analysis of variations in family abundances showed a significant increase in lachnospiraceae a characteristic feature of p2rx7-- mice figure 1h and of an undetermined family belonging to the order clostridiales in p2rx7-- chimeric mice figure 2e.

notably culture ofaerobic and anaerobic bacteria from the cecum revealed the significant reduction of colonyforming units cfus in samples from icosdeficient and p2rx7-- mice figure 3c suggesting that deregulated igamight impair the expansion of the cecal microbial community.the overall microbiota compositions of icos-- mutants clustered together by bdiversity analysis and were well separated from wt and p2rx7--derived samples figure 3a.

different from p2rx7-- mice serum insulin and insulin tolerance tests were not altered in both icos-- and icos--p2rx7-- mice with respect to wt mice figures 3g-3h.

altogether these results underscore the importance of tfh cells in selecting a proficient microbiota for host glucose homeostasis.role of commensal microbiota in altered glucose metabolism of p2rx7-- micewe treated wt and p2rx7-- mice with vancomycin ampicillin and metronidazole vam to deplete most bacterial species present in the gut.

to understand whether the changes in the gut microbiota characteristic of p2rx7-- mice were the cause of the observed metabolic phenotype we transplanted cecal content isolated from p2rx7-- mice into vamtreated wt animals.

microbiota isolated from p2rx7-- mice induced a significant increase in tfhcells compared with autochthonous microbiota figure s5b suggesting that microbiota conditioned by p2rx7-- tfh cells can amplify the regulation of tfh cells in a feedforward loop.
