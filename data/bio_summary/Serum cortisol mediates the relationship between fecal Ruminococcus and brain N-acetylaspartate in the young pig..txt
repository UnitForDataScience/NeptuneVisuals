previous research indicates serum serotonin and serum cortisol relate to microbiota thus in an effort to limit the metabolites analyzed in as possible mediators only serotonin and cortisol were analyzed herein.all selection criteria described above were applied to the regression described herein and only models that met all speci- fied criteria are presented.mediation analysisa mediation analysis was performed using the processmacro designed for spss.the mediation model wasused to characterize the relationship between relative abundances of fecal ruminococcus serum cortisol and a mrs-derived brain metabolite naa using a 3-step process.

interestingly alterations in serum serotonin and cortisol as well as fecal bacteroides and ruminococcus levels have been described in patients with asd.serum cortisol as a mediator between fecal ruminococcus and brain naagiven the relationships reported in our predictive models we used a mediation model to characterize the mediatory effects of serum biomarkers on the rela- tionship between fecal microbiota and neurometabo- lites.

previous research indicates serum cortisol and serum serotonin influence the expression of one another however there was no observed correlation p d 0.148 between cortisol and serotonin in this study.serum cortisol fully mediates the relationship between fecal ruminococcus and mrs-derived brain naaa formal mediation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between ruminococcus and naa through cortisol.

first fecal ruminococcus negatively predicted mrs-derived brain naa concentrations path a. second fecal ruminococcus negatively pre- dicted serum cortisol concentrations path b. third mediation effects were assessed for serum cortisol concentrations.

this initial regression approach was used to characterize fecal microbiota which may serve as predictive fecal biomarkers for brain neurometabolites.stepwise regression for individual genus and diet predicting serum serotonin serum cortisol and ascending colon volatile fatty acidsfrom the initial stepwise regressions the following candidate fecal genera were identified as significant predictors of one or more neurometabolites and were used in subsequent regression analyses to identify pos- sible mediating variables bacteroides clostridium xivb ruminococcus and butyricimonas.

in the following paragraphs we will discuss i predictive models between fecal microbiota and brain metabolites ii predictive models between fecal micro- biota and serumcolonic biomarkers and iii a media- tion model through which serum biomarkers mediate the relationship between fecal microbiota and brain metabolites.fecal microbiota predict neurometabolitesthe first objective of this analysis was to identify novel relationships between fecal microbiota and neurome- tabolites.

previous research indicates both serotonin and cortisol release can be influenced by bacterial strains.in a probiotic study supplementation of lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and bifidobacterium longum r0175 decreased urinary cortisol levels in healthy human volunteers fur- ther indicating bacterial strains can influence cortisol levels.although lactobacillus was not identified as a predictive bacteria for neurometabolites in this study we assessed the interaction of lactobacillus and serum cortisol and the correlation was not significant data not shown.

for a mediation to occur there must have been a significant indirect effectmeaning the effect of the independent variable fecal ruminococcus through the mediator serum cortisol on the dependent variable spectroscopy- derived naa must be significant.the following 3-step framework was used to deter- mine the mediationpath a a regression model was used to describe the relationship between the independent vari- able ruminococcus and the dependent variable naa.path b a regression model was used to describe the relationship between the inde- pendent variable ruminococcus and the mediator cortisol.in the third step the process macro was used and a bootstrapping method applied to estimate the mediation effects.

this finding is supported by previ- ous research in which decreased serum cortisol was observed in individuals with asd.it should be noted that the implications of cortisol in asd vary widely with some research suggesting elevated cortisol in asd patients.although these inconsistent results could be attributed to differences in methodological approach i.e.

these findings further suggest that specific bacterial strains may differentially impact serum cortisol con- centrations rather than attributing the cortisol changes to a particular disease state.third the indirect pathway of the mediation indi- cated cortisol has a mediatory effect on the relationshipfigure 2. cited literature for mediation results.

salivary vs. serum cortisol as well as the heterogeneity of symptoms among individuals with asd it is important to note that diverse micro- bial populations may differentially influence serum cortisol concentrations.

indi- vidual regressions with ascending colon eubacterium or fecal clostridium xivb and butryricimonas did not meet selection criteria for inclusion into stepwise predictive models of serum serotonin serum cortisol or volatile fatty acids and were therefore excluded.
