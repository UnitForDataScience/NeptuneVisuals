The loss of the protective function of intestinal barriers that interacts with the environment measured as increased intestinal permeability and the changes occurring in the microbiota composition have been proposed as a mechanism potentially explaining the pathogenesis of immune related toxicity.In this review we discuss the new perspectives on the involvement of PD-1 and PDL-1 in the cross talk between gut microbiota and immune fitness and how gut microbiota impacts on the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL-1 treatments in cancer.INTRODUCTIONIn the last years the modulation of immune checkpoint network is becoming an important therapeutic strategy for anti-cancer treatments.

In this review we discuss the new perspectives onthe involvement of PD-1 and PDL-1 in the cross talk between gut microbiota and immune fitness and how gut microbiota impacts on the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and anti- PD-L1 treatments in cancer.PD-1PD-L1 AXIS IMMUNOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONSPD-1 receptor also called CD279 represents one of the most important target for immunological therapy.

The involvement of gut microbiota in the outcome of anti cancer therapy and the role of immune response create new questions from a preclinical and clinical standpoint in the cancer field 40 .MICROBIOME AND CANCERGut microbiota complexity and behaviour deserve the definition of tissue organ as introduced and thoroughly discussed by Burcelin and collaborators 41 a major immunological organ which means metabolic organ that influences different pathways of whole metabolism.

Different members of the microbiota and their components have been demonstrated to interact with specific immune components influencing the synthesis of regulatory cytokines.The final decision towards tolerance vs reactivity is the result of integrated signals from the microbiota and immunenon immune cells in the local microenvironment42 .

In particular the presence of Ruminococcus  Gram negative and Alistipes  Gram- positive is involved in TNF production  while an enriched Lactobacillus microbiota correlates with the fail of response.Thus microbiota may have a crucial role in influencing cancer treatment efficacy and considering the close interaction with immune system it's reasonable to supposed its influence in response to ICIs or other immunotherapies.In fact recently Vetizou et al.

This data support the idea that microbiota modifying immune response could influence the response of both chemotherapy and immunotherapy Table 1.67-72 Furthermore the microbiota profiles already studied in IBD and liver diseases could be useful to stratify cancer patients treated with ICIs 73-80.MICROBIOME AND PD1-PD-L1 AXISIt's known that PD1-PDL1 axis plays a key role in the regulation of immune system and that immunotherapy is more efficient in T cell inflamed tumors rather than in T cell deficient tumors.

It was also demonstrated that recolonization with healthy mouse commensal microbiota can correct the immune deficiency.Fargarsan showed that PD-1-- mice have a significant alteration in microbiota composition reduction of anaerobic bacteria of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroidaceae increase in Enterobacteriaceae and at the general level increase in members of theFigure 1 A new proprosed approach for the management of immunotherapy cancer treatment.Erysipelotrichaceae Prevotellaceae Alcaligenaceae and TM7 genera incertae sedis and it's supposed to be caused by a decreased capacity of IgA of binding bacteria83.
