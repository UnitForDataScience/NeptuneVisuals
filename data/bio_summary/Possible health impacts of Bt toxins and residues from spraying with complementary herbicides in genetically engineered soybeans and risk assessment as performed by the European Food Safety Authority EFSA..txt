therefore the risk assessment taken from traditional bt toxins used in biological pest control can only be applied to a limited extent to the bt toxins expressed in plants.further the cry toxins are expressed by the plants throughout the whole period of vegetation while the traditional sprays are used in a time-limited and tar- geted manner if necessary.

since the stacked intacta soybeans and food and feed derived thereof are likely to contain residues from spray- ing with glyphosate formulations the possible interaction between bt toxins and co-stressors such as pesticides are relevant to the health risk assessment.other examples of synergies that are specifically rel- evant for the health risk assessment of intacta soybeans include the effect that protease inhibitors can have on the toxicity of bt toxins such an inhibition could delay the digestion of proteins including cry toxins and thus enhance toxicity by prolonged or increased exposure.

as yet there has not been a fully comprehensive review of possible health impacts due to bt toxins expressed in genetically engineered plants in interaction with constituents from soybeans that in addi- tion are resistant used herein as a synonym for 'toler- ant' to glyphosate or other herbicides.assessment of the toxicity of bt toxinswhen reviewing existing data it has to be taken into account that most of the data on the toxicity of bt toxins are generated by using organisms primarily relevant for environmental risk assessment.

in genetically engineered soybean mon87701 a specific bt toxin is expressed classified as cry1ac.in contrast to native bt toxins there are several rea- sons to assess in more detail the potential toxicity of bt toxins expressed in genetically engineered plants it is known that there are several differences in the structure of the cry toxin expressed in the genetically engineered plants and those used in traditional mixtures  .

the sprayed proteins can be expected to mostly degrade while bt toxins expressed in plants will be present in the harvest and--depending on further processing--will also be present in feed and food.the mode of action of cry toxins is not fully under- stood.

moreover trunca- tion and mutagenesis of synthetic toxins might alter their range of toxicity compared with the native toxins.

thus selectivity of bt toxins as expected from experiments with organisms exposed to the bt toxins alone might not be observed in combination with other stressors.multiple challenges or stressors continuously affecting organisms can be regarded as the normal real-life situ- ation in the field as well as in regard to consumption of food and feed.

although empirical data on mammals are mostly lacking the data that are available can be used to derive robust hypothe- ses for further investigation of health risks combinato- rial effects are known to enhance the toxicity of bt toxins in invertebrates and have been observed in experiments with pyrethroids  azadirachtin  avidin bacteria  nosema  and other bt toxins  .

the deg- radation of the inhibiting proteins will vary but they will not be removed completely .several combinatorial mechanisms that can enhance the toxicity of bt toxins have thus far been described these are also relevant for the risk assessment of plants expressing these toxins.

the toxicity def- inition must include the adverse effects caused by these toxins not only in the short term therefore subchronictable 1 overview of some combinatorial effects of bt toxins known to enhance toxicitydescription of combinatorial effects known to enhance toxicity of bt toxinssome referencesavailability of specific co-factorsbroderick et al.

secondly soybeans produce many plant allergens and there is a specific risk that the bt protein can enhance the immune system response to these compounds at the consumption stage.in assessing these questions it should also be taken into account that bt toxins from other transgenic plants such as stacked maize can be mixed with the soybeans in the diet and thereby enhance immune system responses based on the mechanisms identified even if the soybeansdo not express bt toxins themselves.

2 it is known that bt toxins have immunogenic properties since soybeans naturally contain many allergens these immunogenic properties raise specific questions.

while bt toxins are expressed in several genetically engineered maize and cotton plant events mon87701 and its stack mon87701 x mon89788 are the first bt soybean varie- ties cultivated in countries such as brazil and argentina to be given authorisation for import into the eu.
