The detection of human viral DNA in faeces may reflect the presence of a complex viral popu- lation in the human gut or mucosal cells whose role in human biology needs to be further explored.ResultsStructure and diversity of the human gut DNA viromeMetagenomics sequences of the gut microbiota of 27 Hadza hunter-gatherers from Tanzania age 8-70 11 urban Italians from Bologna Italy age 21-40 22 urban US individuals from Norman Oklahoma age 7-50 24 Matses hunter-gatherers age 1-42 and 12 ruralHuman DNA gut virome in different populations 4729Tunapuco from Peru age 3-44 were recovered from pre- vious studies Obregon-Tito et al.

2015.The gut DNA virome is a complex entity that could persist inside the human host in a population-specific wayTo identify patterns of viral community variation among Hadza Matses Tunapuco and western individuals Italians and US people we determined co-occurrence associa- tions meaning the frequency of concomitant detection of two taxa between viral species and then clustered them according to the co-occurrence profile as previously described by Biagi and colleagues 2016 for the human gut microbiome.

To further explore the gut microbiome variation in human populations here we characterized the human DNA viral community from publicly available gut metagenome data sets from human populations with different geographical origin and lifestyle.

The main findings of these studies highlighted the presence of discriminatory viruses in malnourished children and in chil- dren with enteric diseases compared to healthy controls but compositional virome differences between healthy sub- jects related to lifestyle and community-based differences of sampled populations were not explored.To fill these gaps in knowledge here we present an anal- ysis of the human DNA virome variation across the gut microbiome of human populations with different lifestyles.

Even if genetic evidence of a potential pathogenic behaviour was found in the DNA virome from all the study populations our data also raise the question of the biological importance of the gut virome in human physiology and the possible role of our virome counterpart as a co-evolutionary partner.

Studies of the human virome are just at the begin- ning and only recently the retrieval of viral sequences in large sequence data sets has been possible thanks to bio- informatics tools which can identify viral sequences within metagenomes Roux et al.

2015 was proven also for the viral counterpart we compared the gut virome biodiver- sity among the five populations by considering the number of viral species per sample Fig.

Conversely the viral contamination of food resources may also feed the human gut virome Rzezutka et al.

Thus it is tempting to speculate that the higher contribution of Beta- papillomavirus to the gut virome of this traditional population could be partially attributable to living in helminth-endemic areas.In summary this work constitutes a first important step in the characterization of the viral metacommunity within the faecal microbiome of human populations with different lifestyles.
