5. as expected inhibi- tion of c. difficile atcc 43255 growth by culture super- natant of b. ovatus occurred only in the presence of bile acid during culture p  0.05. the addition of 0.5 bile acids in- hibited c. difficile atcc 43255 growth approximately two- fold even in the absence of b. ovatus p  0.001. however the bacterial supernatant of b. ovatus snug 40239 cultured in the same concentration of bile acid 0.5-supplemented medium significantly decreased c. difficile atcc 43255 growth up to five-fold p  0.0001 and the effect was elim- inated after adding cholestyramine in the supernatant p  0.0001. therefore the increased inhibitory effect of b. ova- tus snug 40239 on c. difficile growth was shown to be mediated by bile acid metabolites produced during culture.confirmation of bile acids metabolizing genes and trans- formed metabolites in bacteroides strainsin order to confirm whether the bacteroides strains used in this study have the enzymes necessary for bile acid metabo- lism we performed pcr with baicd and bsh genes as tar- gets.

4a and b. treatment of both c. difficile strains with b. ova- tus snug 40408 showed a decrease in c. difficile growth but the effect was only significant in the treatment of c. dif- ficile kctc5009 with 1 bile acid conditions p  0.01 fig.

stati- stical analysis and subsequent visualization were performed using graphpad prism 7.03. p-value of  0.05 by t-test and two-way anova with tukey's test was considered to in- dicate statistical significance.resultsgrowth of c. difficile with various compositions of bile acidsvegetative c. difficile atcc 43255 and kctc 5009 cells were treated with amino acid-conjugated bile acids tca and tdca a primary bile acid ca and a secondary bile acid dca figs.

although the strains used in this study are classified as the same species they were shown to exert a strain-dependent capability to use bile acid metabolites and inhibit c. difficile growth.an interesting result of this study is that the culture ofbacteroides was shown to promote the growth of c. difficile kctc 5009 in the absence of bile acid.

the bile acids of taurocholic acid tca cholic acid ca deoxycholic acid dca and taurodeoxycholic acid tdca sigma-aldrich were added to cultures at final concentra- tions of 0.1 0.01 and 0.001 in deionized water.

4a.in the absence of bile acid c. difficile kctc 5009 showed significantly higher growth in the presence of bacterial su- pernatants from all bacteroides strains p  0.01. however growth of c. difficile atcc 43255 was unaffected by bacte- roides strains under the same bile acid-free conditions.

the in vitro data presented in this study should be further con- firmed in vivo.ca a c. difficile germinant inhibited vegetative growth ofdifficile atcc 43255 at a concentration of 0.1. these results support our hypothesis that bsh inhibits c. difficile vegetative cells because ca is produced by amino acid de- conjugation of tca by bsh.

the primary bile acid ca is converted to the secondary bile acid dca by the bacterial enzyme bile acid 7a-dehydroxylase.
