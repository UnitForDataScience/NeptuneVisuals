oral amoxicillin metronidazole vancomycin have already been shown to induce significant and some- times long-lasting gm perturbations in mice   but the effect of oral doxycycline on the gm has not been described.in light of these findings the authors believe it is important to determine if and how oral doxycycline affects the gm of mice.

alternatively non-antibiotic analogs of doxycycline could be consid- ered  .in summary the common gene-regulating dose of doxycycline causes a significant dysbiosis in female c57bl6ncrl mice.

demonstrating and characteriz- ing any effect may enable investigators to control for or eliminate microbiota-induced variability in their experi- mental design.we hypothesized that oral doxycycline would alter the composition of the gm as evidenced by changes in the fecal microbiota fm in female c57bl6ncrl mice and that the gm would return to baseline when the drug was temporarily discontinued.

one-way permanova performed todetermine pair-wise differences detected significant dif- ferences between the later three time-points of dox- treated mice and all control time-points p  0.0135 to 0.0045 f  47.03 to 208.2. conversely within-group differences in dox-treated mice were limited to differ- ences between the starting time-point and the last three time-points p  0.0045 f  59.47 to 103.6. significant within-group differences in the control group were found between time-points 1 and both 3 p  0.018 f  13.44and 5 p  0.014 f  11.discussionthese data indicate that the fm of female c57bl6ncrl mice is significantly altered by administration of doxycy- cline at a concentration of 2 mgml in the drinking water.
