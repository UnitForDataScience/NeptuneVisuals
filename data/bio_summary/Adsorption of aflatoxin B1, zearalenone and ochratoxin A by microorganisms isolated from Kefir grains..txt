For the Kefir microbial consor- tium after treatment at pH 7 a considerable amount of AFB1 20 and OTA 37 were released from pellets while for ZEA only 14Table 3Percentage of AFB1 OTA and ZEA eliminated by the strains isolated from Kefir.

On the other hand the bacteria A. syzygy KFGM1 bound 65 AFB1 50 OTA and 64 ZEA and the yeast K. servazzii KFGY7 reduced AFB1 OTA and ZEA in milk by 74 62 and 95 respectively.

Nevertheless the Kefir consortiummycotoxin complexes were quite stable at pH 3 no ZEA was released while only 5 and 6 of OTA and AFB1 were respec- tively released.The bacteria L. kefiri KFLM3 and A. syzygii KFGM1 performed similar- ly to the Kefir consortium for ZEA but retained less AFB1 and OTA.

The amount of mycotoxins removed in milk reached 80for AFB1 81 for OTA and 100 for ZEA depending on the strain.

Our results showed that the binding of mycotoxins by the Kefir consor- tium was moderate as 40 of AFB1 56 of OTA and 65 of ZEA were re- leased into buffer after the successive treatments.

In the case of the yeast K. servazzii KFGY7 b-13 and 16-D-glucans of the cell wall are possibly primarily responsible for the observed adsorption effects since those glucans were also implicated in the mycotoxin-adsorbing properties of S. cerevisiae  .ConclusionsIt can be concluded from this study that Kefir grains and their iso- lates L. kefiri KFLM3 A. syzygii KFGM1 and K. servazzii KFGY7 are able to bind considerable amounts of mycotoxins AFB1 OTA and ZEA in milk.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified afla- toxin B1 AFB1 in group 1 carcinogenic to humans OTA and FB1 in group 2B possibly carcinogenic to humans and ZEA in group 3 not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans .Milk is the primary source of nutrition for growing infants.

The retention times of AFB1 OTA and ZEA were approxi- mately 20.3 min 13.5 min and 19.7 min respectively.

The highest percentage of elimination was obtained with AFB1 31 followed by OTA 12 and ZEA 10.
