in total 40 56 and 65 of afb1 ota and zea were respectively released from the kefir culture biomass.concerning the strains isolated from kefir the results show that the microorganismmycotoxin complexes are more sensitive at ph 3 and more stable at ph 7 and 8. strain l. kefiri kflm3 released after the three treatments a considerable amount of afb1 66 ota 74 and zea 46. similarly strain a. syzygii kfgm1 released 64 of afb1 65 of ota and 55 of zea.

moreover all of the lab iso- lates from our kefir demonstrated their ability to remove zea from mrs medium with a percentage ranging between 9 and 60. those obser- vations are in agreement with those of  who reportedtable 5percentage of afb1 ota and zea recovered from microorganism cells after incubation with buffer solutions at ph 7 3 and 8.the results are expressed as the means - standard deviation n  3. values are not significantly different from control experiments p b 0.05.binding of zea in mrs by l. plantarum.

for the kefir microbial consor- tium after treatment at ph 7 a considerable amount of afb1 20 and ota 37 were released from pellets while for zea only 14table 3percentage of afb1 ota and zea eliminated by the strains isolated from kefir.

on the other hand the bacteria a. syzygy kfgm1 bound 65 afb1 50 ota and 64 zea and the yeast k. servazzii kfgy7 reduced afb1 ota and zea in milk by 74 62 and 95 respectively.

nevertheless the kefir consortiummycotoxin complexes were quite stable at ph 3 no zea was released while only 5 and 6 of ota and afb1 were respec- tively released.the bacteria l. kefiri kflm3 and a. syzygii kfgm1 performed similar- ly to the kefir consortium for zea but retained less afb1 and ota.

nonetheless the binding effect was the most relevant and strong for almost all of the isolates.according to  the lab binding assays for afb1 in mrs showed no effect 0. however lab showed the ability to bind ota up to 29 and zea up to 60. compared to the other isolates strain kfgm5 showed the highest binding capacity for ota 29 followed by kflm4c 16 kflm3 and kfgm1 15. moreover the zea binding capabilities of strains kflm3 kfgm1 and kfgm5 were the strongest under those conditions because respectively 60 52 and 46 adsorp- tion was observed.the adsorption capability of eleven yeast strains in ypd medium is also presented in .

the amount of mycotoxins removed in milk reached 80for afb1 81 for ota and 100 for zea depending on the strain.

our results showed that the binding of mycotoxins by the kefir consor- tium was moderate as 40 of afb1 56 of ota and 65 of zea were re- leased into buffer after the successive treatments.

in the case of the yeast k. servazzii kfgy7 b-13 and 16-d-glucans of the cell wall are possibly primarily responsible for the observed adsorption effects since those glucans were also implicated in the mycotoxin-adsorbing properties of s. cerevisiae  .conclusionsit can be concluded from this study that kefir grains and their iso- lates l. kefiri kflm3 a. syzygii kfgm1 and k. servazzii kfgy7 are able to bind considerable amounts of mycotoxins afb1 ota and zea in milk.

greater amounts of zea were eliminated from medium by yeasts up to 44. strain kfly4 was able to bind 44 of zea and strain kfgy2 bound 31 and strain kfgy1 bound 29.the same experiments were repeated in milk.

our results showed that the microor- ganism consortium of kefir grains adsorbed 82 to 100 of aflatoxin b1 afb1 zearalenone zea and ochratoxin a ota when cultivated in milk.

nonetheless the strain k. servazzii kfgy7 retained more mycotoxin after the desorption experiments 65 69 and 67 for afb1 ota and zea re- spectively.

the international agency for research on cancer iarc classified afla- toxin b1 afb1 in group 1 carcinogenic to humans ota and fb1 in group 2b possibly carcinogenic to humans and zea in group 3 not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans .milk is the primary source of nutrition for growing infants.

in consideration of the health risks and to ensure food safety the joint faowho expert 0168-1605c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.committee on food additives jecfa sets limits for mycotoxin daily in- take as follows zea - 0.5 mgkg body weight per day and ota - 112 ngkg body weight per week and no limits have been indicated re- garding tolerable intake for afb1 because of its carcinogenic effects  .as a solution to this serious problem numerous physical chemical and biological strategies have been reported for mycotoxin detoxifica- tion.

howev- er as far as we know the effect of kefir microbiota on other myco- toxins has not previously been investigated nor has any active strain been isolated from it.the objective of the current study was to investigate the microbiota characteristics of kefir from tunisia and to isolate bacteria andor yeasts with biodegradation andor adsorption properties for afb1 ota and zea.
