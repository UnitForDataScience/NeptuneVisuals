It is important to point out that Th17 cells are plastic cells as there are apparently a number of vari- ations in differentiated Th17 cells and Th17 cells can convert to Th1 cells or T regulatory Treg cells  .

Based on the knowledge of the characteristics of the Th17 cells in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis it seems likely Th17 cells associated with depression develop a specific pathogenic pheno- type but clearly further investigations are needed to determine the role of Th17 cells in depression including studies of their origin whether they are released from their peripheral niche the gut or if they differentiate in situ in the brain.

Nonetheless the mode of entry of Th17 cells into the CNS needs to be determined in depression to understand the mechanism whereby the proportion of Th17 cells relative to CD4 T cells increases in the brain of depressed mice .Th17 cell pathogenicityOverall Th17 cells found outside the intestine and especially within the CNS are thought to be pathogenic.

This is particularlytrue in EAE where both autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells have been considered pathogenic and Th17 cells expressing IFNc have been considered to contribute to the exacerbation of EAE.Pathogenicity of Th17 cells has also been associated with increased expression of CCR6 IL-23R and granulocyte macro- phage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF.

We briefly consider the potential involvement of Th17 andor IL-17A in multiple sclerosis autism spectrum disor- ders epilepsy and Alzheimer disease as these diseases have already been extensively reviewed elsewhere.Multiple sclerosisThe roles of Th17 cells in the CNS mainly has been described in the context of EAE and multiple sclerosis where there is a massive infiltration of Th17 cells into the CNS.

In CNS diseases it is thought that the signature cytokine produced by Th17 cells interleukin-17A IL- 17A mediates the detrimental effects of Th17 cells.

In depression although Th17 cells increase the lack of a consistent correlation between depression severity and blood IL-17A levels suggests that Th17 cells promote depressive symptoms which may not be entirely dependent on IL-17.

However little is known about the mechanism of action of Th17 cells or the source of CNS Th17 cells in depression.
