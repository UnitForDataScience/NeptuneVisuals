another important question to answer is to determine if th17 cells are bystanders of inflammation as has been described in other cns pathologies associated with th17 cells see section 4. fur- ther studies may also determine if th17 cells can be used as either biomarkers or as a therapeutic target in depression since th17 cells are normally only present in the intestine in healthy individuals and appear in the bloodstream after disease induc- tion .in the remaining portion of this review we review the roles ofth17 cells in the brain that have been shown for other diseases and the properties of these cells that might be of significance for depression.fig.

it is important to point out that th17 cells are plastic cells as there are apparently a number of vari- ations in differentiated th17 cells and th17 cells can convert to th1 cells or t regulatory treg cells  .

based on the knowledge of the characteristics of the th17 cells in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis it seems likely th17 cells associated with depression develop a specific pathogenic pheno- type but clearly further investigations are needed to determine the role of th17 cells in depression including studies of their origin whether they are released from their peripheral niche the gut or if they differentiate in situ in the brain.

nonetheless the mode of entry of th17 cells into the cns needs to be determined in depression to understand the mechanism whereby the proportion of th17 cells relative to cd4 t cells increases in the brain of depressed mice .th17 cell pathogenicityoverall th17 cells found outside the intestine and especially within the cns are thought to be pathogenic.

this is particularlytrue in eae where both autoreactive th1 and th17 cells have been considered pathogenic and th17 cells expressing ifnc have been considered to contribute to the exacerbation of eae.pathogenicity of th17 cells has also been associated with increased expression of ccr6 il-23r and granulocyte macro- phage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf.

we briefly consider the potential involvement of th17 andor il-17a in multiple sclerosis autism spectrum disor- ders epilepsy and alzheimer disease as these diseases have already been extensively reviewed elsewhere.multiple sclerosisthe roles of th17 cells in the cns mainly has been described in the context of eae and multiple sclerosis where there is a massive infiltration of th17 cells into the cns.

in cns diseases it is thought that the signature cytokine produced by th17 cells interleukin-17a il- 17a mediates the detrimental effects of th17 cells.

in depression although th17 cells increase the lack of a consistent correlation between depression severity and blood il-17a levels suggests that th17 cells promote depressive symptoms which may not be entirely dependent on il-17.

however little is known about the mechanism of action of th17 cells or the source of cns th17 cells in depression.

since the discovery in 2005 of the requirement for il-6 and transforming growth factor b tgfb for the differentiation of th17 cells a vari- ety of other cytokines have been shown to promote th17 cell dif-ferentiation in vitro such as tumor necrosis factor tnfa il-1bil-21 or il-23.

bacteria are one of the signals that trigger th17 cells differentiation th17 cells are constitutively present in a part of the gut the lamina propria of the small intestines due to a specific population of bacteria present there segmented filamentous bacteria where they ensure immune surveillance and proper gut function and are quasi absent in other organs such as lung or liver .

infections or other conditions that increase il-6 and tgfb can increase the th17 cell population and once activated th17 cells promote the eradication of extracellular bacteria and fungal infections such as infection by candida albicans  .

th17 cells can also be major pathological contributors to a variety of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis in which th17 cells are autoreactive t cells with pathogenic proper- ties that exacerbate autoimmunity .th17 cells and depressiondepression is a prevalent yet undertreated disease  .
