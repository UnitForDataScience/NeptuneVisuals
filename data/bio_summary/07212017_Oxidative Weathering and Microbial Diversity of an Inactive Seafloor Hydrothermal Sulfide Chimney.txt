Our findings provide valuable insights into the microbe-involved oxidative weathering process and into microbial succession occurring at inactive hydrothermal sulfide chimney after high-temperature hydrothermal fluids have ceased venting.Keywords Fe-oxidizing bacteria oxidative weathering biomineralization inactive hydrothermal chimney microbial diversity microbial successionINTRODUCTIONHydrothermal sulfide chimneys typical products of seafloor hydrothermal activity encompass a variety of complex and dynamic environments where hot reductive hydrothermal fluid interacts with cold oxygenated seawater.

Moreover although hydrothermal venting hadceased the inactive sulfide chimney appears to still accommodate diverse microbial populations.Oxidative Weathering of Inactive Sulfide Chimneys and Involved Fe-Oxidizing Bacterial GroupsOxidative weathering of hydrothermal inactive sulfide structures and deposits is prevalent on the modern seafloor.

Recently revealed that a clear shift occurs from the dominant e-Proteobacteria and Aquificae in active sulfides to bacterial communities dominated by a- b- g- d-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in inactive hydrothermal sulfides indicating that inactive chimneys are remarkably distinct microbial habitats.

In addition although it has been suggested that minerals of inactive chimneys serve as critical energy sources to support the metabolic growth of various chemolithoautotrophs    little is known about the extent to which microbial communities associated with quiescent chimneys continue to utilize those energy sources.After cessation of hydrothermal venting inactive chimneyscontinuously interact with seawater under low-temperature conditions resulting in the oxidative weathering and alteration of various metal sulfides.

Here we present an examination of the oxidative weathering of an inactive sulfide chimney we report correlations between Fe-oxidizing bacterial taxa and the products of alteration reactions and we characterize microbial succession of hydrothermal chimneys at different stages.MATERIALS AND METHODSSampling and Description of SamplesAn inactive sulfide chimney and a young active sulfate chimney were collected from the MEF of the JDF during the AT18-08 cruise of the RV Atlantis with the ROV Jason II dive number J2-577 between July 19 and August 1 2011 Supplementary Figure S1.

However in selected situations pulses of low-temperature fluids may carry thermophilic and hyperthermophilic species derived from deep niches into inactive chimneys.CONCLUSIONIn this study the oxidative weathering and microbial diversity of an inactive hydrothermal sulfide chimney and a young active chimney were analyzed.

81378. doi When its hydrothermal supply ceases hydrothermal sulfide chimneys become inactive and commonly experience oxidative weathering on the seafloor.

Bacterial signatures from the middle JDF14 and outer portions JDF13 are not obviously distinct indicating their possibly homologous environmental parameters.Combining microbial communities that inhabit the youngCAP sulfate chimney and the inactive sulfide chimney in the current study with those in maturely active sulfide structures collected from the same MEF hydrothermal field in previous investigations    provides a rough depiction of the microbial community succession at different stages of hydrothermal chimney aging .At the early nascent stage the chimney is precipitated initially and characterized by the dominant anhydrites.

By contrast archaeal sequences were grouped into four separate clusters by PCoA Supplementary Figure S4 and did not form obviously distinguishable clusters according to their spatial positions within the inactive chimney.DISCUSSIONIn this study numerous Fe-rich ultrastructures with distinctive morphologies and surficial characteristics were commonly observed from outer parts of an inactive sulfide chimney.

Therefore distinct characteristic morphologies on the surfaces of FeOB- associated ultrastructures infer considerably heterogeneous microenvironments with different physicochemical natures on the inactive sulfide chimney walls.Phylogenetic analyses suggest that iron oxidizers dwellingwithin inactive chimneys consist of members of the genus Gallionella and the class z-Proteobacteria.
