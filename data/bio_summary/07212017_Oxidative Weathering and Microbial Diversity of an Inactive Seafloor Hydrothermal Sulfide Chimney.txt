our findings provide valuable insights into the microbe-involved oxidative weathering process and into microbial succession occurring at inactive hydrothermal sulfide chimney after high-temperature hydrothermal fluids have ceased venting.keywords fe-oxidizing bacteria oxidative weathering biomineralization inactive hydrothermal chimney microbial diversity microbial successionintroductionhydrothermal sulfide chimneys typical products of seafloor hydrothermal activity encompass a variety of complex and dynamic environments where hot reductive hydrothermal fluid interacts with cold oxygenated seawater.

moreover although hydrothermal venting hadceased the inactive sulfide chimney appears to still accommodate diverse microbial populations.oxidative weathering of inactive sulfide chimneys and involved fe-oxidizing bacterial groupsoxidative weathering of hydrothermal inactive sulfide structures and deposits is prevalent on the modern seafloor.

81378. doi when its hydrothermal supply ceases hydrothermal sulfide chimneys become inactive and commonly experience oxidative weathering on the seafloor.

recently revealed that a clear shift occurs from the dominant e-proteobacteria and aquificae in active sulfides to bacterial communities dominated by a- b- g- d-proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in inactive hydrothermal sulfides indicating that inactive chimneys are remarkably distinct microbial habitats.

in addition although it has been suggested that minerals of inactive chimneys serve as critical energy sources to support the metabolic growth of various chemolithoautotrophs    little is known about the extent to which microbial communities associated with quiescent chimneys continue to utilize those energy sources.after cessation of hydrothermal venting inactive chimneyscontinuously interact with seawater under low-temperature conditions resulting in the oxidative weathering and alteration of various metal sulfides.

here we present an examination of the oxidative weathering of an inactive sulfide chimney we report correlations between fe-oxidizing bacterial taxa and the products of alteration reactions and we characterize microbial succession of hydrothermal chimneys at different stages.materials and methodssampling and description of samplesan inactive sulfide chimney and a young active sulfate chimney were collected from the mef of the jdf during the at18-08 cruise of the rv atlantis with the rov jason ii dive number j2-577 between july 19 and august 1 2011 supplementary figure s1.

this supports to some degree the possibility that they come from deep beneath the seafloor and are randomly distributed within the inactive chimney.microbial colonization within the young sulfate hydrothermal chimney and microbial succession during chimney evolutionmicrobial communities within the cap sulfate chimney reflect early colonizers during the formation of a hydrothermal chimney.

bacterial signatures from the middle jdf14 and outer portions jdf13 are not obviously distinct indicating their possibly homologous environmental parameters.combining microbial communities that inhabit the youngcap sulfate chimney and the inactive sulfide chimney in the current study with those in maturely active sulfide structures collected from the same mef hydrothermal field in previous investigations    provides a rough depiction of the microbial community succession at different stages of hydrothermal chimney aging .at the early nascent stage the chimney is precipitated initially and characterized by the dominant anhydrites.

however in selected situations pulses of low-temperature fluids may carry thermophilic and hyperthermophilic species derived from deep niches into inactive chimneys.conclusionin this study the oxidative weathering and microbial diversity of an inactive hydrothermal sulfide chimney and a young active chimney were analyzed.

although hydrothermal fluid flow had ceased inactive chimneys still accommodate an abundant and diverse microbiome whose microbial composition and metabolic potential dramatically differ from their counterparts at active vents.

at last by examining microbial communities within hydrothermal chimneys at different formation stages a general microbial community succession can be deduced from early formation stages of a sulfate chimney to actively mature sulfide structures and then to the final inactive altered sulfide chimney.

since the discovery of seafloor hydrothermal vents  many surveys have been performed to investigate microbial communities in active hydrothermal vent structures      .

however compared with numerous explorations of active hydrothermal structures there have been few studies focusing on inactive chimneys and the process of microbial succession after active venting ceases.

fe-rich ultrastructures with characterized morphologies such as twisted stalks indicative of certain known feob groups can be produced by two taxonomically distinct species raising the question as to what types of feob are present and contribute to oxidative weathering near hydrothermal vents  .in the present study an inactive sulfide chimney was collected from the main endeavor field mef of the juan de fuca ridge jdf supplementary figure s1.
