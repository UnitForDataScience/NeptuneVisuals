Raw sequencing data of two S. marcescens strains from A. annae were referenced against the S. marcescens WW4 genome with 80 mapping Table 1.

Panamanian frog species host unique skin Bell S. C. Alford R. A. Garland S. Padilla G. and Thomas A. D. 2013.

In the live Bd treatment this experiment found 111 differentially expressed genes DEGs in S. marcescens strain one Supplementary Table 6 and 100 DEGs in S. marcescens strain two Supplementary Table 7.

While the S. marcescens used in this study have excellent potential for bioaugmentation efforts and mechanistic inquiries certain strains of S. marcescens are known opportunistic human pathogens Hejazi and Falkiner 1997.

Caution should be taken in working with uncharacterized wild-type strains of this bacteria including safety education of personnel and BSL-2 standards in all laboratory work.In understanding S. marcescens and their anti-Bd mechanisms in more detail as it pertains to the cutaneous microbiome we found that the two S. marcescens strains examined in this study had various transcriptomic shifts in response to Bd.

This preliminary evidence on the role of a T6SS in S. marcescens and other gram negative bacteria in the amphibian-Bd system therefore merits further examination.The upregulation of 2-dehydro 3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase gene coding for a key regulatory enzyme in the Entner-Duodoroff ED pathway was seen in both S. marcescens strains in response to heat-killed Bd.
