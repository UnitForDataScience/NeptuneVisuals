Thus far no study has focused on the bacterial microbi- ota present in bovine abortion material.The objective of this study was to characterize the microbiota of samples from cattle abortions using high throughput sequencing of the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene to provide new insight into the bacteria that may play a role in bovine abortion.Materials and methodsSample collectionSamples from 64 bovine abortion cases from different cantons of Switzerland that were submitted for routine abortion investigation were collected from October 2012 to March 2014 Bern n  40 Luzern n  6 SolothurnSwitzerland.

The healthy fetal samples were all negative no bacterial DNA was amplified in thecontrol samples including the two negative extraction control tubes.Sequencing overviewA total of 81 samples from 64 bovine abortion cases were analyzed to investigate the composition of the bac- terial microbiota.

On aver- age samples from the AC showed 42 - 1 SEM OTUs whereas samples from the PL showed 110 - 1 SEM OTUs.Composition of the associated bacterial communities in the AC and PLAt the phylum and class level 16 and 35 subcategories were identified in the abortion material samples respec- tively Figure .

In contrast to previous studies that focused on implicat- ing specific bacteria from bovine abortion material by bacterial culture and targeted molecular detection   - we studied the total bacterial microbiota present in abortion material from cattle using a 16S rRNA ampli- con sequencing approach.

lactis which is mainly associated with bovine mastitis  has also been isolated from a bovine abortion .

From the 64 cases of aborted cows we analyzed 81 samples 32 samples of placenta PL and 49 of fetal abomasal content AC.

In addition we used a broad- spectrum bacterial culture to compare and confirm the sequencing results.This study revealed that the taxonomic groups pre- sent in the bovine abortion material were Proteobacteria AC  87.35 PL  72.13 Firmicutes AC  10.51PL  15.66 and Bacteroidetes AC  1.99 PL  7.81.
