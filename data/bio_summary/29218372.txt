MicrobiomeIntroductionFungi are ubiquitous members of soil communities compris- ing up to 60 of soil biomass with hundreds of distinct spe- cies present in a gram of soil   and are crucial to soil health.

Together these findings sug- gest that glyphosate use impacts some pathogenic and sap- rophytic taxa associated with wheat but that the specific players influenced by glyphosate are likely to be contin- gent upon other factors such as soil edaphic characteristics host availability or initial population densities.Table 2Metrics for fungal co-occurrence networks in soil and the rhizosphere in different cropping systems and glyphosate treatmentsAt a finer taxonomic scale OTU level taxa belonging to Gibberella Fusarium and Chaetomium were among those that increased consistently in relative abundance with glyph- osate application among locations in soil from no-till cropping systems whereas OTUs in Fusarium Nectriaceae and Purpureocillium increased in CRP soil.

Although mechanical weed management inputs such as tillage are often used as a primary management practice to control weeds prior to planting direct-seed or no-till practices are increasingly employed as a means to reduce soil erosion conserve soil moisture increase soil organic matter and save on fuel costs .

Glyphosate is considered to be a relatively environmentally friendly herbicide due to its low acute toxicity for mammals short environmental half-life 3-90 days or 44-60 days on average fate profileglyphosate as a cation is strongly adsorbed to soil particles and its low activity and mobility after it reaches soil  .However as a result of its widespread use since the 1970s growers and the public alike continue to express concerns about the environmental impact of glyphosate on soil and environ- mental health  .

For rhizosphere samples 1 ml of soil suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube centrifuged 16000g 1 min to pellet rhizosphere soil and associated microbes H2O was removed and soil was suspended in the PowerSoil buffer.

In rhizospheres from plants grown in CRP soil there were increases in an unidentified fungus OTU172 and Ascomycete OTU49 and Trichoderma andtreated NT soil and Cladophialophora Chaetothyriales and Pleosporales species in glyphosate-treated NT soil Fig.

Thus glyphosate may be directly inhibitory to some fungi or serve as a carbon or nutrient source for other taxa   potentially altering soil fungal commu- nity composition or diversity in agricultural systems.In addition to direct effects the impacts of glyphosate on soil fungi may be mediated through their effects on host plants.

Rather microbial adaptation toglyphosate may be mediated via the substantial resource in- puts to soil ecosystems through herbicide-killed plants.Although many studies of glyphosate effects on microbial communities have been performed results are often inconsis- tent with research reporting positive negative or little effect of glyphosate on microbial community composition or diver- sity   - -.Inconsistent results are not surprising given the strong influ- ence of location and soil characteristics on microbial commu- nities and the generally small effect of glyphosate treatments at a field scale .

Those taxa with the most negative interactions specific to a treatment included Arrhenia Cladophialophora and Ophiosphaerella species in non- treate d NT soil an d Humicola  Fusarium  a nd Chaetomiaceae species in glyphosate-treated NT soil.

Colored bars at the top of the graph indicate the glyphosate treatment cropping system and location of soil origin for each samplewhich had many negative associations in non-treated CRP soil.
