Gut microbiota may have immunomo- dulatory effects in autoimmune conditions such as alopecia areata and further study may elucidate disease mechanisms and lead to alternative treatment options for these patients for whom treatment options are cur- rently limited.INTRODUCTIONAlopecia areata AA is an autoimmune inflammatory condition of the hair follicle.

It is classified as patchy totalis and universalis depending on the degree of hair loss.Fecal microbiota transplant FMT is increasingly being used to treat patients with Clostridium difficile infection CDI.

Prior to FMT he was persistently noted to have stage S4b alopecia 95-99 hair loss despite intralesional injections but he improved at least 2 grades to stage S2 25-49 hair loss after FMT  .

Notably while the steroid injections had only been adminis- tered to his scalp after FMT he has had regrowth of hair in other areas of his body as well.DISCUSSIONThis report highlights 2 patients with coexisting AA and recurrent CDI who experienced hair regrowth after FMT.

Gut microbiota have recently emerged as potential immunomodulators with the capacity to elicit physiologic or pathologic responses in the host.CASE 1A 38-year-old man with alopecia universalis diagnosed 10 years previously presented with bloody diarrhea and ab- dominal pain.

Animal models show curative effects for AA with general or topical JAK inhibitors.Systemic immunomodulators such as ustekinumab IL-12IL-23p40 antibody which has shown effi- cacy as induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's dis- ease and apremilast phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor have been proven effective in other inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and show promise for AA.Evidence linking gut microbiota and immunologic effects in the host is growing.

A recent study by Maslowski and Mackay looked at microbiota as the basis for increased incidence of autoimmune conditions in developed countries.

They found that western diets which tend to contain more fat and less fiber were associated with different compositions of gut bac- terial species and lower levels of short-chain fatty acids potentially driving diseases such as asthma diabetes and allergies.Helicobacter pylori infection has been implicated in immune thrombocytopenia illustrative of the potential for gut microbiota to trigger extraintestinal autoimmune disease.More recently clinical trials have focused on the role of FMT in inflammatory bowel disease IBD.

The patient's scalp B a few months and C 1.5 years after FMT.mechanism of IBD remains unclear there is evidence sug- gesting that an inappropriate immune response to gut microbiota plays a role in the pathogenesis.Published case reports have suggested improvement in multiple sclerosis Parkinson's disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenic pur- pura after FMT.We present 2 case reports where notable improvement in AA was observed after FMT was performed for recurrent CDI.
