Lactic acid was produced by all vaginal isolates with B. longum strains producing the highest levels but only 32 of isolates produced hydrogen peroxide.

In this study our main objectives were 1 to apply species-specific quantitative PCR to confirm the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in the vaginal microbiomes of reproductive aged women previously determined based on cpn60 barcode sequencing and 2 to characterize vaginal Bifidobacterium isolates based on carbohydrate fermentation patterns hydrogen peroxide production lactic acid production resistance to low pH and lactic acid and susceptibility to antibiotics.Material and methodsSamples and microbiome profilesVaginal microbiome profiles from 492 healthy women were previously published by our research group .

crispatus strains Mann-Whitney p 14 0.240 .Tolerance to low pH and lactic acidA subset of vaginal bifidobacteria isolates 1540 and three typestrains were selected for testing tolerance of low pH and high lactic acid concentrations and the percent survival values for each isolate under different conditions are shown in .All bifidobacteria tested were able to survive at pH 4.5 with up to 100 mM lactic acid conditions typical of vaginal fluid of healthy women with a Lactobacillus dominated microbiome and that have been shown to be lethal to many vaginosis associated bacteria .

A. omnicolens and B. kashiwanohense n 2 were the isolates most affected by lactic acid with survival declining considerably when incubated with 100 mM lactic acid pH 3.9.

At physiological concentrations 56e111 mM both forms of lactic acid are effective in decreasing HIV infectivity in vitro at lower concentrations L-lactic acid has greater virucidal activity than D- lactic acid .

However what is noteworthy is that the levels of lactic acid produced by vaginal bifidobacteria especially B. longum are comparable to those of L. crispatus the organism most often associated with a healthy vaginal micro- biome .Considering that lactic acid is a hallmark of a healthy vaginaknowing the levels of acid produced by different bifidobacteria is of interest when evaluating whether a vaginal microbiome dominated by Bifidobacterium should be considered as protective as a microbiome dominated by Lactobacillus.

Other studies have shown that protonated lactic acid rather than lactate anion is the microbicidal form of lactic acid  which emphasizes the role of pH in mediating lactic acid activity.

Where more than four isolates were available B. breve B. longum four isolates were selected randomly to be included in the assay.

As expected most strains clustered based on species identity except for the two B. kashiwanohense-like isolates N4G05 and N5G01 and three B. longum isolates W35-1 I239-2 and IV239.

The use of trehalose by B. breve differed between the type strain and most vaginal isolates type strain was negative and 1315 vaginal isolates were positive.
