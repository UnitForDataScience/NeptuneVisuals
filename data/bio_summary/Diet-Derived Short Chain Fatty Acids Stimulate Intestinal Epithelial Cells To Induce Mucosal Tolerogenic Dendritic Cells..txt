Furthermore our data showed that the expression levels of RALDH1 in small intestinal epithelial cells correlated with the activity of vitamin A-converting enzymes in mesenteric lymph node dendritic cells along with increased numbers of intestinal regulatory T cells and a higher production of luminal IgA.

Tolerogenic dendritic cells DCs are well-described immune cells that interact with other hematopoietic cells to maintain a balanced mucosal immune system 20 21.

For flow cytometric analysis of ALDEFLUOR- reacted cells cells were subsequently stained with anti-CD45-PE-Cy7 clone 30F11 anti-CD11c-PE clone N418 both from eBioscience anti- CD103-biotin clone M290 BD Biosciences Breda the Netherlands MHC class II clone M5114 affinity-purified from hybridoma cell culture supernatants Percp-conjugated BD Biosciences streptavidin and SYTOX Blue Invitrogen to discriminate between live and dead cells.

With the production of retinoic acid RA the active metabolite of vitamin A these DCs are crucial for the differentiation of regulatory T cells and promoteIgA class-switching of B cells and induce the expression of gut- homing molecules on lymphocytes 20-22.

When we checked for the expression of RALDH enzymes in small intestinal scrapings which mainly consist of epithelial cells we observed a high mRNA expression of aldh1a1 Fig.

E mICcl2 were analyzed for aldh1a1 expression after a 30-min incubation with pertussis toxin PT before SB stimulation for 24 h. Stimulation of mICcl2 cells with 4-CMTB were analyzed for aldh1a1 F and nlpr3 G. mRNA expression levels of aldh1a1 and nlpr3 were normalized to those of Ubiquitin and Cyclo.

The critical role of retinol metabolism by small intestinal epithelium was shown by the absence of tolero- genic DCs in CRBPII-deficient mice because CRBP is predom- inantly expressed in small IECs and is necessary for the uptake of retinol 26.In this article we report that fiber-enriched diets promote vitamin A metabolism in epithelial cells in the SIs as well as enhanced tolerogenic activity in MLN DCs increased percentages of in- testinal regulatory T cells and higher levels of IgA production in the lumen of the intestine.

Because CD103 DCs are crucial for the induction of regulatory T cells via their production of RA we examined the percentages of Foxp3 T cells in the SIs of these mice.

A aldh1a1 levels of mICcl2 cells stimulated with the HDAC inhibitor TSA MS275 M344 or Droxinostat for 24 h. B aldh1a1 levels of mICcl2 cells stimulated with sodium bu- tyrate SB TSA and SBTSA.

In turn these DCs produce RA themselves and thereby are able to induce regulatory T cells and IgA-producing B cells.
