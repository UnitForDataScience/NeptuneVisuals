compared with females males had lower concen- trations of all bile acids in the azithromycin group and lower concentrations of secondary bile acids lca dca udca hdca in the florfenicol group.discussionin this study azithromycin and florfenicol were found to increase adipogenesis in mice and alter the overall abundance diversity and composition of the gut microbiota the production of scfas and the metabolism of bile acids in colonic contents.

the distance between samples was calculated using the evolution and abundance information in the sequence of each sample to reflect whether there was a significant difference in the microbial community between samples.linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was employed to detect significant differences in relative abundance of microbial taxa between groups at the species level.analysis of scfas and bile acids in colonic contentsthe scfa standards included acetic acid aa propionic acid ppa isobutyric acid iba n-butyric acid nba isovaleric acid iva n-valeric acid nva and 2-ethylbutyric acid eba.

the bile acid standards included cholic acid ca deoxycholic acid dca cheno- deoxycholic acid cdca lithocholic acid lca ursodeoxycholic acid udca hyodeoxy- cholic acid hdca and two isotope-labeled bile acids lca-d4 and ca-d5.

for example other clostridium family microbiota such as ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae might share similar functions with clostridium scindens and the relative abundances of these bacteria were also decreased by florfenicol and azithromycin .another possible explanation could be that the florfenicol and azithromycin decreased the total level of gut microbiota in our study as indicated by the chao and ace index and they reduced the number of all bacteria involved in secondary bile acid synthesis.

to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the effects of azithromycin and florfenicol on gut microbiota composition and adipo- genesis in mice have been explored.we observed that antibiotics disturbed the gut microbiota composition.

down- regulation of tgr5 could disrupt energy metabolism and lead to obesity .conclusionswe found that azithromycin and florfenicol altered gut microbiota composition the produc- tion of scfas and the metabolism of bile acids in colonic contents and increased adipogenesis in mice.

the concentrations of all bile acids except cdca and ca in the mice treated with azithromycin decreased compared with the control group and the mice treated with azithromycin showedconcentration of scfas and bile acids in samples from the normal and antibiotic-treated groups.

in our study a therapeutic dose was used which reduced the total number of scfa-producing bacteria and then decreased the concentration of scfas in the gut.we found that florfenicol and azithromycin increased the concentrations of primary bile acids in the colon but decreased the concentrations of secondary bile acids suggesting down- regulation of the 7-dehydroxylation process.

this finding is consistent with our results indicating that in addition to thedehydroxylation process other reactions possibly involving bacteroidaceae and lachnospira- ceae also affect the production of secondary bile acid.in our study male mice in the florfenicol group had lower concentrations of secondary bile acids and male mice in the azithromycin group had lower concentrations of all bile acids.

for example lab studies have found that certain antibiotics such as vancomycin penicillin and chlortetracy- cline can alter the bacterial composition and endocrine activity of the gut microbiota affect production of short-chain fatty acids scfas and the metabolism of bile acids and increase body fat -.

the 7-dehydroxylation activity of clostridium and eubacterium in the gut microbiota is the key process that turns primary bile acid into secondary bile acid .

gut microbiota regulates bile acid metabolism by reducing the levels of tauro-beta-muricholic acid a naturally occurring fxr antagonist.
