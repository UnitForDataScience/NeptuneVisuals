The salmon skin microbial community was determined using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing in five different experimental groups control 7 days after infection with low- dose SAV 14 days after infection with low-dose SAV 7 days after infection with high-dose SAV and 14 days after infection with high-dose SAV.

Fusobacteria abundance also increased as a result of infection from  20 inChanges in the alpha diversity of the Atlantic salmon skin microbial community in response to SAV3 infection.

to the control group and .SAV-induced skin dysbiosis is characterized by expansion of potentially pathogenic taxaAmong the 18 OTUs with abundances that were significantly different among experimental groups we found significantly increased abundances of members of the families VibrionaceaeThree-dimensional principal coordinate analysis obtained with Bray Curtis distances A and B or weighted UniFrac distance matrix C and D of the salmon skin bacterial communities from day 7 infection A and C and day 14 infection B and D. Each dot represents one individual fish.

Future studies should address whether viral load in the skin correlates with the state of skin dysbiosis reported in this study and whether skin immune responses against the virus correlate with the observed changes in the skin microbiome of infected fish.We found that both SAV3 infection dose and time of infection are strong predictors of the skin salmon microbiota.

Since our observations show a higher presence of Tenacibaculum in SAV infected fish in a dose-dependent fashion this link deserves to be fur- ther investigated for a better understanding of the dynamics of disease outbreaks in salmon farms.ConclusionsSAV3 infection results in skin dysbiosis in Atlantic salmon characterized most prominently by the loss of Proteobacteria.

Both infection treatment and time after infection were strong predictors of the skin microbial community composition.

Environmental factors known to influence teleost microbiomes include diet stress water quality toxicants and infection     .During the course of an infection the relationships between the microbiota and the host immune system are vulnerable to changes.
