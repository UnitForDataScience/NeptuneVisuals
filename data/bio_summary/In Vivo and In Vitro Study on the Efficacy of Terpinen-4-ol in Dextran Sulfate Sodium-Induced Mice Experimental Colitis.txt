Fp  0.05 vs DSS-treated NLRP3-- mice group.nlrP3 inflammasome inhibition May Be Mainly responsible for the anti- inflammatory effect of Ter against Dss-induced colitisThe DSS-induced mice colitis model was used to further elucidate the key role of NLRP3 inflammasome in TER protective effectsby comparing WT mice and NLRP3-- mice.

In contrast mice deficient for NLRP3 were less sensitive to DSS-induced acute colitis and TER treatment exerted little protective effect on DSS- induced intestinal inflammation in NLRP3-- mice.

We found that oral administration of DSS in NLRP3-- mice induced a less severe colitis than WT mice and produced lower levels of MPO and IL-1b in colonic tissues which suggested the important roleof NLRP3 inflammasome in DSS-induced colitis.

Theseresults may suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome play an importantrole or at least play a partial role in TER-mediated colitis alleviation.We further compared the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome in colon samples of WT and NLRP3-- mice by western blotting.

However we found that NLRP3-- mice were significantlyprotected from DSS-induced colitis showing a less severity of symptoms including reduced DAI scores and colon shortening compared with WT mice .

MPO activity and IL-1b level in colon of NLRP3-- mice also showed a significant inhibitoryeffect compared with those in the WT mice in response to DSS.

However high levels of caspase-1 ASC and IL-1b were observed in the colon of WT mice receiving DSS but not in thoseof NLRP3-- mice.

Furthermore DSS-increased caspase-1 ASC and IL-1b levels in the colon were significantly decreased by TER treatment in WT mice but did not in NLRP3-- mice.

MeanwhileTER did not significantly protect the development of DSS- induced colitis in NLRP3-- mice suggesting that NLRP3 inflammasome may be involved in the preventive effect of TER on DSS-induced colitis.

As shown in  there is an undetectable level of NLRP3 protein in colon tissues of NLRP3-- mice.
