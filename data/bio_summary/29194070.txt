In the following section we first consider two contrasting perspectives to frame the connecting relationship between gut micro- biota and behavior and then use one of them to speculate on a plausible mechanism underlying the observed association between gut microbiota and the development of compulsive checking and locomotor sensitization.Two perspectivesThere is a rapidly expanding literature reporting on studies that show specific changes in gut microbiota and perturbations in particular behaviors and vice versa raising the concept of an active and bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis  6 Below we outline two possible but polar models linking microbiota and behavior one model in which gut microbiota are sufficient to produce a change in behavior and another in which microbiota are neither necessary nor sufficient for the change in behavior.Model of microbiota stimulating behaviorOne way to conceptualize an observed association between gut microbiota and behavior is the perspectiveTwo examples of operational taxonomic units OTUs from the family Lachnospiraceae that changed with repeated injections of quinpirole QNP.

Compulsive checking behavior is identified by the presence of a significant difference between quinpirole-treated and saline-treated rats - all four mea- sures need to differ from controls for the claim of 'com- pulsive' checking 8 and hence the set of these four measures is termed 'criteria measures' for compulsive checking.In addition to the aforementioned criterion measures we also evaluated 'time to next checking bout' This measure is greatly reduced in quinpirole-sensitized rats and has been proposed to index the third constitutive component of compulsive checking behavior - 'satiety' or rest after checking The computation of checking bouts is detailed in and a modification in Total distance traveled was calculated as the sum of distances moved in progression segments and lingering episodes.

The OTU data identified as significant by Kruskal-Wallis were imported into IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 23.0 IBM Corp. Armonk New York USA and analyzed with a 2 x 3 repeated-measures ANOVA where the drug factor had two levels saline vs. quinpirole and the repeated-measures injection factor had three levels injections 1 5 and 9.ResultsInduction of compulsive checking and locomotor sensitizationTo examine whether changes in gut microbiota accompanythe behavioral response to quinpirole we first established that in the present experiment the current protocol of quinpirole injections was effective in inducing the expected development of compulsive checking as well as locomotor sensitization and alteration in the spatial distribution of locomotion.Development of compulsive checking left panel displays the criterion measures defining compulsive checking - frequency of checkinglength of check recurrence time of checking and stops before returning to check.

Although the mechanisms linking commensal bacteria and behavior are yet unidentified there is evidence for multiple ways by which gut microbiota could activate brain circuits mediat- ing behavior considering that microbiota elaborate a wide range of appropriate signaling molecules monoamines SCFAs and hormones and have epitopes recognizable byboth intestinal epithelial and mucosal immune cells it follows that gut microbiota have access to neuronal vagus enteric nervous system endocrine as well as immune channels for communication with the brain       7.In all according to the 'microbiota stimulating behavior' model an observed association between gut microbiota and behavioral phenotype indicates a relatively direct effect of the specific microbes on brain-specific neural circuits driving the behavioral phenotype.Model of infrastructural supportIn contrast to the aforementioned model of behavioral activation by a relatively direct pathway from the gut to the brain a model of 'infrastructural support' does not draw a causal pathway from the change in microbiota to an associated change in behavior.

The fre- quency of checking and length of check are variables that index the vigor in the motor performance of checking whereas recurrence time of checking and stops before returning to check are variables related to the focus on the task of checking .

As noted microbes from these families produce butyrate that provides energy for other microbes and host cells and promotes energy expenditure as well as facilitating fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis Hence one of the functional effects of quinpirole-induced altered microbiota may be to promote the shift toward FFA utilization found in quinpirole-sensitized rats 98.If the change in microbiota does indeed contribute to the aforementioned shift in energy utilization with quin- pirole then in addition to enabling sensitized locomotion the microbiota also play a role in the performance of compulsive checking and hence by implication from the animal model in OCD.

Checking behavior was defined with reference to the most visited locale labeled 'key place' or 'key locale' these terms are equivalent which in most instances is also the locale with the longest total duration of stops A visit to the key place is also referred to as a 'check' or 'checking' and the following sets of four measures of checking behavior were computed i frequency of checking total number of visits to the key locale ii length of check total duration of stay at the key locale divided by the fre- quency of visits there this measure is also an indirect index of ritual-like behavior as the appearance of motor rituals in quinpirole-treated rats is associated with a very short duration of stay in the key locale  iii recurrence time of checking mean duration of return times to the key locale 'return time' is the interval from departure to next arrival at the locale and iv stops before returning to check mean number of places visited between returns to the key locale.

Hencethis regimen of quinpirole injections was effective in inducing compulsive checking.right panel shows another variable - duration of rest after a bout of checking - that has been suggested to constitute a component of compulsive checking and which characteristically is short in quinpirole-treated rats In the present study as expected and as shown by the light gray rectangle in 1 the duration of rest on injection 9 was significantly shorter in the quinpirole-treated rats compared with the saline controls t-test t9  2.03 P  0.05 one tail.The time course of development of compulsive checking can be assessed by examining the regression line for each criterion measure across injections.

Surette and Henry SzechtmanLong-term treatment of rats with the D2D3 dopamine agonist quinpirole induces compulsive checking proposed as animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder and locomotor sensitization.

However it remains to be established which of those findings if any are necessary for the patho- physiology of compulsive checking 14.Although a research focus on central mechanisms underlying OCD and behavioral sensitization is a very reasonable strategy a plausible contribution of peripheral mechanisms should not be discounted given the findings of peripheral immune factors altering behavior and the possibility of gut-brain signaling modulating behavioral perfor- mance Moreover there are suggestions for a role of peripheral mechanisms in quinpirole sensitization 8 and OCD .In the present study we investigate the possibility of a role for peripheral mechanisms - and of gut microbiota in particular - in the phenomena of quinpirole-induced locomotor sensitization and compulsive checking.
