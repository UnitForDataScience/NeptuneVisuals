DSS treatment significantly decreased the family of Rikenellaceae control  18 DSS  2 and increased the Gram-negative Bacteroides genus control  9 DSS  58 on day 3 of treatment both belonging to the Bacteriodetes phylum.

The Bacteriodetes family has pre- viously been linked to DSS treatment  and thus it is not unrealistic that DSS increases the chance of LPSTLR-receptor interaction leading to tolerogenic cell responses.In our study an acute effect of DSS was reflected in fold changes of Hp and Il1a in colon on day 3 of treatment and this effect was more pronounced in mice also treated with ampicillin.

In turn DSS treatment decreased the Gram-positive Firmicutes genus Candidatus Arthromitus also known as seg- mented filamentous bacteria SFB control  0.2 DSS  0.004 and the Firmicutes order of Clostridiales control  39 DSS  5 .

were inversely correlated to colonic MUC1 expression in control and DSS treated mice on day 1 following DSS treatment with a positive correlation in DSS treated mice.

Our study further showed that DSS treatment pro- motes Gram-negative phyla especially Bacteriodetes which correlated with Treg cells in the MLN and mRNA transcripts of the barrier-related Retnlb Relmb on day 3 of DSS treatment.

However in all mice except for those receiving both DSS and ampicillin the levels were decreased when the treatment was terminated .Acute increase in Treg cells and late decrease in NK and NK T cellsOn day 3 of treatment MLN of all treatment groups contained more activated T helper cells compared to the control group.

On day 25 after treatment there was a small late effect in DSS mice simultaneously treated with ampicillin with a 2-fold upregulation of Foxp3 and Il1a in colon.DSS treatment decreased gut microbiota diversity with a skewing towards Gram-negative phylaThere were clear time point differences and development in the bacterial composition within each treatment group .

This led to slight differences in DSS intake Figure A in  ranging from 14.1 to 21.3 mg DSS per gram body weight in the individual mice but it has previously been shown that DSS load only acts in a straight dose-dependent manner in a criti- cal load above 30 mg per gram body weight .

Interestingly for the two groups treated with DSS and ampicillin with or without LPS there was a negative correlation between Treg cells and relative counts of the Lachnospiraceae family 25 days post-treatment .No clinical effect of low-dose DSS in the absence of microbiota suppressionClinically the DSS-only treated mice were statistically indistinguishable from the control mice with only small perturbations in food and water intake mildly resembling the pattern of the ampicillin-treated groups immediately following treatment cessation Figure D in .

In turn Muc1 in colon was only significantly upregulated in DSS mice simultaneously treated with ampicillin on day 1 post-treatment whereas DSS treatment alone or supplementation with LPS did not produce a Muc1 upregulation.
