On day 5 a similar fraction of the reads 62 were composed of Faecalibacterium Blautia Ruminococcus Veillonella Roseburiawas determined using Shannon's diversity which also showed there was a reduction in diversity after azithromycin treatment 10.60 95 CI 8.82-12.36 compared with placebo 15.42 95 CI 13.24-17.80 P  .0004.

In this double-masked randomized controlled trial we showed that healthy children treated with 1 dose of azithromycin had a reduction in the intestinal micro- bial a-diversity 5 days after treatment whether measured as Simpson's or Shannon's diversity.

In an observational study of 142 Finnish children Korpela et alfound a significant reduction in bacteria richness that per- sisted over 6 months whereas Bokulich et al 12 did not seeFigure 3.

The prespecified outcome was a-diversity inverse Simpson's a-diversity index with secondary outcomes of b and g Simpson's and Shannon's diversities.Results.

Assuming from preliminary results that the standard deviation of inverse Simpson's in the population would be approximately 3.0 this would suggest a detectable effect size of 2.0 the units of inverse Simpson's are effective numbers.Sample Processing and SequencingRectal samples were collected in the field at baseline day 0 and at 5 days after treatment day 5.

The primary outcome of this study was pre- specified as a-diversity inverse Simpson's at the genus level within microbiome samples collected from children 5 days after treatment with azithromycin or placebo.

To assess sample collection preparation and sequencing reproducibility of the diversity measure we used 1 duplicate aliquot of extracted DNA for each of the 80 study participants and 1 duplicate field swab for each of 11 study participants.

Because the children enrolled in this study were vaginally delivered initially breastfed with natural tran- sition to solid food and were unexposed to antibiotics prior to this study it could be argued that the gut microbiome of these children was maximized for diversity 2 5 12 26.

This is the expected result if azithromycin has compara- ble effect on diversity across children.Multiple observational studies in adults have suggested that antibiotic exposure reduces phylogenetic bacterial diversity of the human gut microbiome Supplementary Table 1 4 10 11.
