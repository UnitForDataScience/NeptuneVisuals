eighty children were selected for the 16s rrna gene sequencing because we estimated that 40 children per arm would provide 80 power to detect a 23 standard error effect size in the pri- mary outcome of inverse simpson's a-diversity assuming a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. assuming from preliminary results that the standard deviation of inverse simpson's in the population would be approximately 3.0 this would suggest a detectable effect size of 2.0 the units of inverse simpson's are effective numbers.sample processing and sequencingrectal samples were collected in the field at baseline day 0 and at 5 days after treatment day 5. examiners changed into cleangloves and placed the swab 1-3 cm into the anus rotating 360 degrees and repeating until stool was visible on the swab.

specifically it is enriched for faecalibacterium seen in high abundance in children and adults of the western population and blautia ruminococcus and treponema species seen in high abundance in african populations 20 21. bacteroides species were min- imally represented in the gut of these children although all were vaginally delivered 2 25. previous studies have shown that this signature was associated with c-section delivery 2 25 26. the discrepancy suggests geographic location as a factor that influences children's microbial composition and diversity 27 28. we also found that bifidobacterium spp.

eighty of the eighty-seven healthy and eligible children aged 1-60 months from a single village were randomly assigned to either the pla- cebo or azithromycin treated group with samples from 80 children subjected to 16s rrna gene analysis.

at 5 days after treatment 40 children aged 1-60 months were analyzed in the azithromycin-treated group and 40 chil- dren in the placebo-treated group.
