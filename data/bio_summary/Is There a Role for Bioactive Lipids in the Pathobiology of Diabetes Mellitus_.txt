Streptozotocin STZ induces significant production of IL-2 interferon-g IFN-g and TNF-a by TH1 lymphocytes which activates macrophages leading to the production of excessof nitric oxide NO and other nitroso compounds to induce apoptosis of b cells  Human duct cells situated close to b cells produce TNF-a which can induce death of pancreatic b cells .

These results imply that the actions of PGE2 depend on its time of action the dose employed and its interaction with T cells and possibly other cells in the milieu .It was reported that PGE2-sensitive T cells produce 200 pg ml of both IL-2 and IL-4 while PGE2-resistant T cells secrete1000 pgml of IL-2 IL-4 or both.

OK-432-treated NOD mice showed a significant increase both in the number of the mononuclear spleen cells and their natural killer cell activity and had few effector cells thatinduce apoptosis of pancreatic b cells .OK-432 an inducer of TNF-a inhibited insulitis and autoim- mune diabetes in NOD mice and BB rats that usually develop type 1 DM.

OK-432-injected mice showed decreased Thy-1.2 or CD8 spleen cells and increased surface-Ig S-Ig cells whereas the proliferative response of spleen cells to con- canavalin A P  0.01 and lipopolysaccharide LPS P  0.05 increased suggesting that protections against the development of type 1 DM by OK-432 treatment in NOD mice was due to serum factors including endogenous TNF and IL-2 and probably some other unidentified factors  see -.Low-dose IL-2 selectively enhances IL-2-dependent STAT5 activation of Tregs in healthy individuals.

These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic b cells gut liver and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.Keywords bioactive lipids arachidonic acid lipoxin a4 polyunsaturated fatty acids resolvins protectins maresinsintrodUCtionThe diabetes mellitus DM is classically divided into two types type 1 diabetes that occurs because of autoimmune destruction of b cells that results in insulin insufficiency and so are insulin dependent and type 2 diabetes characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and consequent hyperinsulinemia.CLiniCaL ManiFestations oF dMIn majority of the subjects with type 2 DM no symptoms could be present at the time of detection of the disease.

Thus LPS preventsdevelopment of type 1 DM in NOD diabetic mice by Treg induc- tion downregulation of TLR-4 and MyD88-dependent signaling pathway possibly by augmenting the development of a potential tolerogenic DC subset .Based on the preceding discussion it can be said that type 1 DM and other AID occur due to an imbalance between autore- active effector T cells Teffs and regulatory T cells Tregs.

It is likely that HFD increases pro-inflammatory PGE2 decrease the activities of desaturases resulting in a deficiency of AA EPA and DHA the precursors of LXs resolvins protectins and maresins and a concomitant decrease in BDNF production since LXA4 and PUFAs enhance the production of BDNF and so a deficiency of LXA4 and AA EPA and DHA results in decreased formation of BDNF that will tilt the balance more in favor of pro-inflammatory status resulting in insulin resistance dysfunction of pancreatic b cells and finally development of type 2 DM and when destruction of b cells occurs leads to type 1 DM.

This suggests that methods designed to deliver BDNF in appropriate amounts may form a new approach to prevent or manage type 2 DM.How these apparently disparate events and molecules can be integrated to the role of PUFAs in type 2 DMConCLUsion pUFas and tHeir MetaBoLites in dMBased on the preceding discussion that PUFAs and their metabo- lites hypothalamus and their peptides and neurotransmitters BDNF insulin receptors in the brain gut peptideshormones cytokines and gut microbiota play a role in obesity and DM it is evident that all these factorsevents are interrelated.In a series of previous studies we showed that oral feed- ing of oils rich in o-3 EPA and DHA and o-6 GLA and AA or pure FFAs GLA AA EPA and DHA prevent apoptosis of insulin-secreting rat insulinoma RIN5F cells in vitro andalloxan-induced type 1 DM and STZ-induced type 1 and type 2 DM in experimental animals -  .

Since PUFAs and their metabolites may have a role in stem cell survival proliferation and differen- tiation - it is an intriguing possibility that AA and LXA4 and possibly resolvins protectins and maresins may enhance proliferation of pancreatic b cells andor augment proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells to insulin-secreting b cells.

These results are surprising indicating that resolvin D1 and probably other similar compounds such as protectins and maresins over a period may gradually enhance the prolifera- tion of residual b cells or induce proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells into b cells that can secrete insulin and ameliorate hyperglycemia.
