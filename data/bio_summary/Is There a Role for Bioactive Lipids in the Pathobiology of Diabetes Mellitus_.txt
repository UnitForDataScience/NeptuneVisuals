streptozotocin stz induces significant production of il-2 interferon-g ifn-g and tnf-a by th1 lymphocytes which activates macrophages leading to the production of excessof nitric oxide no and other nitroso compounds to induce apoptosis of b cells  human duct cells situated close to b cells produce tnf-a which can induce death of pancreatic b cells .

these results imply that the actions of pge2 depend on its time of action the dose employed and its interaction with t cells and possibly other cells in the milieu .it was reported that pge2-sensitive t cells produce 200 pg ml of both il-2 and il-4 while pge2-resistant t cells secrete1000 pgml of il-2 il-4 or both.

ok-432-treated nod mice showed a significant increase both in the number of the mononuclear spleen cells and their natural killer cell activity and had few effector cells thatinduce apoptosis of pancreatic b cells .ok-432 an inducer of tnf-a inhibited insulitis and autoim- mune diabetes in nod mice and bb rats that usually develop type 1 dm.

ok-432-injected mice showed decreased thy-1.2 or cd8 spleen cells and increased surface-ig s-ig cells whereas the proliferative response of spleen cells to con- canavalin a p  0.01 and lipopolysaccharide lps p  0.05 increased suggesting that protections against the development of type 1 dm by ok-432 treatment in nod mice was due to serum factors including endogenous tnf and il-2 and probably some other unidentified factors  see -.low-dose il-2 selectively enhances il-2-dependent stat5 activation of tregs in healthy individuals.

these pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic b cells gut liver and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 dm.keywords bioactive lipids arachidonic acid lipoxin a4 polyunsaturated fatty acids resolvins protectins maresinsintroductionthe diabetes mellitus dm is classically divided into two types type 1 diabetes that occurs because of autoimmune destruction of b cells that results in insulin insufficiency and so are insulin dependent and type 2 diabetes characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and consequent hyperinsulinemia.clinical manifestations of dmin majority of the subjects with type 2 dm no symptoms could be present at the time of detection of the disease.

thus lps preventsdevelopment of type 1 dm in nod diabetic mice by treg induc- tion downregulation of tlr-4 and myd88-dependent signaling pathway possibly by augmenting the development of a potential tolerogenic dc subset .based on the preceding discussion it can be said that type 1 dm and other aid occur due to an imbalance between autore- active effector t cells teffs and regulatory t cells tregs.

it is likely that hfd increases pro-inflammatory pge2 decrease the activities of desaturases resulting in a deficiency of aa epa and dha the precursors of lxs resolvins protectins and maresins and a concomitant decrease in bdnf production since lxa4 and pufas enhance the production of bdnf and so a deficiency of lxa4 and aa epa and dha results in decreased formation of bdnf that will tilt the balance more in favor of pro-inflammatory status resulting in insulin resistance dysfunction of pancreatic b cells and finally development of type 2 dm and when destruction of b cells occurs leads to type 1 dm.

this suggests that methods designed to deliver bdnf in appropriate amounts may form a new approach to prevent or manage type 2 dm.how these apparently disparate events and molecules can be integrated to the role of pufas in type 2 dmconclusion pufas and their metabolites in dmbased on the preceding discussion that pufas and their metabo- lites hypothalamus and their peptides and neurotransmitters bdnf insulin receptors in the brain gut peptideshormones cytokines and gut microbiota play a role in obesity and dm it is evident that all these factorsevents are interrelated.in a series of previous studies we showed that oral feed- ing of oils rich in o-3 epa and dha and o-6 gla and aa or pure ffas gla aa epa and dha prevent apoptosis of insulin-secreting rat insulinoma rin5f cells in vitro andalloxan-induced type 1 dm and stz-induced type 1 and type 2 dm in experimental animals -  .

this may explain the high incidence of type 2 dm in south east asians and pima indians.is type 2 dm having its origins in the perinatal periodtype 2 dm may have its origins early in life since low birth weight newborn showed high prevalence of type 2 dm in later life -.

since pufas and their metabolites may have a role in stem cell survival proliferation and differen- tiation - it is an intriguing possibility that aa and lxa4 and possibly resolvins protectins and maresins may enhance proliferation of pancreatic b cells andor augment proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells to insulin-secreting b cells.

these results are surprising indicating that resolvin d1 and probably other similar compounds such as protectins and maresins over a period may gradually enhance the prolifera- tion of residual b cells or induce proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic stem cells into b cells that can secrete insulin and ameliorate hyperglycemia.

human pancreatic duct cells can produce tumour necro- sis factor-alpha that damages neighbouring beta cells and activates dendritic cells.

studies revealed that enteroviruses accelerate the development of type 1 dm in part due to their tropism for b cells and ability to replicate in b cells at an appropriate and precisely right time to induce the diabetogenic process.

instillation of bacterial species that are normally present in the human duodenum into the healthy rat pancreatic ductal system induced infiltration of neutrophil polymorphonuclear cells and monocytesmacrophages around the pancreatic ducts which released il-6 il-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 that in turn produced hydropic degeneration of b cells an event that is very much similar with the morphologic findings seen in patients dying with type 1 dm.

in type 1 dm il-2 augments tregs cells at an 10-fold lower concentration of il-2 than that is needed by t memory tm cells.
