in this thematic minireview series jbc presents six exciting articles discussing a range of approaches for identifying microbial natural products and elucidating their biosynthetic pathways and their physiological effects which could poten- tially be leveraged for developing new therapeutics.genomic meta-transcriptomic and metabolomics studies con- trasts with the bottlenecks in identifying and ascribing func- tions to small molecules.

these multi-omic approaches are also revealing changes in microbial diversity decreased abundance of commensals and changes in metabolites e.g.

they also empha- size the importance of and challenges with mapping the microbial metabolome under defined conditions.

in addition to the better-studied gut microbiome the nasal and skin microbiomes represent other environments of host-mi- crobe metabolic interplay ripe for natural product mining.martinez leone and chang 2 focus on advances in identi-fying microbial metabolites linked to gastrointestinal and peripheral diseases.

16s rrna amplicon sequencing is being used to identify members of commensal microbial communities while multi-omic tech- niques are helping to elucidate functional characteristics of their metabolism.

this metabolic cycle involves host udp-glucuronosyl transfer- ase which adds glucuronic acid and microbial 3-glucuroni- dases that remove it.

rational targeting of microbial glucuronidase reduces dose-limiting gi toxicity of sn-38 and might be an effective strategy for increasing the tolerance and efficacy of other drugs whose metabolisms are influenced by the microbiome.the review by olsan byndloss faber rivera-chavez tsolisand baumler 5 highlights yet another dimension of the host- microbiome interface i.e.
