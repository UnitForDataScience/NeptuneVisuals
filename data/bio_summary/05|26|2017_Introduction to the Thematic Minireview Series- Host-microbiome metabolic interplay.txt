The human gut is estimated to host 1000 bacterial species that exist within distinct micro-niches.

The shared metab- olite capital between the host and the microbiome is extensive and tightly controlled.

However despite the influence of microbe- derived metabolites on many aspects of host physiology behav- ior and pathology our understanding of this metabolic inter- face is still in its infancy and its therapeutic targeting is largely untapped.

The sheer numbers of microorganisms that colonize humans in the trillions and collectively harbor 2 orders of magnitude more genes than the host hint at the depth of the secondary metabolite trove.

The latter is acted upon by host flavin monooxygenases to produce TMAO.
