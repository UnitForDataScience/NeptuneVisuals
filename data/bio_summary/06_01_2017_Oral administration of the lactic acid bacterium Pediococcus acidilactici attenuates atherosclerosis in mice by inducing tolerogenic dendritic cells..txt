Although the specific antigens driving atherosclerosis remain unclear the activation of CD4 T cells by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells DCs has been demonstrated to aggravate atheroscle- rosis in both humans and mice .The DC-expressed co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 activate T-cell proliferation by binding to their recep- tors on T cells their absence renders DCs tolerogenic and prevents the development of atherosclerosis by suppressing Th1-driven inflammation in mice .

R037 treatment did not affect plasma cholesterol content or body weight Table  however the size of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root was significantly decreased in R037- treated mice compared to control mice 2.3 - 0.15 x 105 vs. 3.3 - 0.29 x 105 um2 respectively P  0.01 Fig.

Further morphometric analysis of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus was performed by immunohistochem- istry no significant differences in macrophage accumula- tion and CD4 T-cell infiltration were detected between R037-treated and control mice data not shown.Administration of R037 suppressed CD4 T-cell proliferation Th1-driven inflammation and cytokine production from splenic lymphocytesTo examine the effect of R037 treatment on the systemic immune system we analyzed the expression of activa- tion and proliferation markers in CD4 T cells from the spleen of control and R037-treated mice.

Splenic lymphocytes from R037-treated mice secreted significantly less IFN-g IL-17 and IL-10 than those from control mice P  0.05 Fig.

e.CD11c cells from R037-treated mice exhibited immunosuppressive effects on CD4 T cells in vitroBecause tolerogenic DCs are known to inhibit T-cell acti- vation  we investigated whether splenic DCs from R037-treated mice have an immunosuppressive effecton CD4 T cells.

Splenic CD11c cells from control or R037-treated mice were co-cultured with splenic CD4 T cells from untreated ApoE-- mice in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody.

Ki-67 expression was significantly inhibited in CD4 T cells co-cultured with CD11c cells from R037-treated mice compared to those cultured with CD11c cells from control mice P  0.05 Fig.

The suppressive effect of DCs derived from R037-treated mice on CD4 T-cell proliferation was further confirmed by co-culturing CFSE-labeled CD4 T cells with splenic CD11c cells from control or R037-treated mice.

Therefore we believe that the immune mechanisms triggered by R037 administration in mice such as suppression of Th1-driven inflammation and T-cell cytokine production might be attributed to upregulation of PD-L1 expression in splenic DCs at least in part resulting in atherosclerosis prevention.Analysis of T-cell activation markers revealed no signifi-cant differences in the levels of CD44highCD62LlowCD4 effector T cells and CD44lowCD62LhighCD4 naive T cells between R037-treated and untreated mice.
