although the specific antigens driving atherosclerosis remain unclear the activation of cd4 t cells by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells dcs has been demonstrated to aggravate atheroscle- rosis in both humans and mice .the dc-expressed co-stimulatory molecules cd80 and cd86 activate t-cell proliferation by binding to their recep- tors on t cells their absence renders dcs tolerogenic and prevents the development of atherosclerosis by suppressing th1-driven inflammation in mice .

r037 treatment did not affect plasma cholesterol content or body weight table  however the size of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root was significantly decreased in r037- treated mice compared to control mice 2.3 - 0.15 x 105 vs. 3.3 - 0.29 x 105 um2 respectively p  0.01 fig.

further morphometric analysis of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus was performed by immunohistochem- istry no significant differences in macrophage accumula- tion and cd4 t-cell infiltration were detected between r037-treated and control mice data not shown.administration of r037 suppressed cd4 t-cell proliferation th1-driven inflammation and cytokine production from splenic lymphocytesto examine the effect of r037 treatment on the systemic immune system we analyzed the expression of activa- tion and proliferation markers in cd4 t cells from the spleen of control and r037-treated mice.

splenic lymphocytes from r037-treated mice secreted significantly less ifn-g il-17 and il-10 than those from control mice p  0.05 fig.

e.cd11c cells from r037-treated mice exhibited immunosuppressive effects on cd4 t cells in vitrobecause tolerogenic dcs are known to inhibit t-cell acti- vation  we investigated whether splenic dcs from r037-treated mice have an immunosuppressive effecton cd4 t cells.

splenic cd11c cells from control or r037-treated mice were co-cultured with splenic cd4 t cells from untreated apoe-- mice in the presence of anti-cd3 antibody.

ki-67 expression was significantly inhibited in cd4 t cells co-cultured with cd11c cells from r037-treated mice compared to those cultured with cd11c cells from control mice p  0.05 fig.

a. the suppressive effect of dcs derived from r037-treated mice on cd4 t-cell proliferation was further confirmed by co-culturing cfse-labeled cd4 t cells with splenic cd11c cells from control or r037-treated mice.

therefore we believe that the immune mechanisms triggered by r037 administration in mice such as suppression of th1-driven inflammation and t-cell cytokine production might be attributed to upregulation of pd-l1 expression in splenic dcs at least in part resulting in atherosclerosis prevention.analysis of t-cell activation markers revealed no signifi-cant differences in the levels of cd44highcd62llowcd4 effector t cells and cd44lowcd62lhighcd4 naive t cells between r037-treated and untreated mice.

we investigated the effect of the probiotic lactic acid bacteriumpediococcus acidilactici r037 on atherosclerosis using apolipoprotein e-deficient apoe-- mice.

six-week-old apoe-- mice were orally administered r037 six times a week.

mice treated with r037 for 12 weeks exhibited markedly attenuated atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root 2.3 - 0.15 x 105 um2 vs. 3.3 - 0.29 x 105 um2 respec- tively p  0.01 n  15-17 each group.

the expression of ki-67 in cd4 t cells the population of interferon g-producing cd4 t cells in the spleen and pro-inflamma- tory cytokine production from splenic lymphocytes were significantly decreased in r037-treated mice.

interestingly splenic dendritic cells dcs isolated from r037-treated mice suppressed cd4 t-cell proliferation and pro-inflam- matory cytokine production ex vivo suggesting that r037 treatment induced tolerogenic dcs.
