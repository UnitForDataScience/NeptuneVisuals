Leaves were selected at random from the lower branches of each tree and the number of mines per leaf the percentage of leaf damaged by mines and the length of each leaf were recorded.We did not have any a priori expectations about appropriate parametric models of the relationships between bleeding canker and leaf miner presence or damage.

a Location of each tree sampled indicating presence or absence of disease symptoms with symptomatic trees represented by red circles presence of leaf miners blue circles co-infection purple circles or absence of either grey circles.b Probability of bleeding canker disease across trees of varying height and trunk diameters black lines indicate contours of disease probability which are also reflected in the colours.

Furthermore symptoms associated with bleed- ing canker disease were not found to be associated with leaf miner damage and in line with previous observational studies Straw  Williams 2013 leaf miner damage did not explain significant variation in symptoms associated with bleeding canker.

Permutational ANOVA tests were run using the 'adonis' function from the vegan package in Rusing month leaf miner infection tissue sample type symptomatic or healthy latitude symptom severity and tree DBH as main effects with UNIFRAC distances as a response term with 9999 permutations.ResultsSpatial distributionOverall our results indicate that the bacterial pathogen is present across the UK while the leaf miner pest has a more restricted dis- tribution Figs 1a S3.

This lack of an observed relationship between leaf miner infestation and bleeding canker symptoms was echoed by the finding that leaf miner infestation explained no significant variation in the composition of bark-associated microbiota across the subset of 46 trees for which microbiome sequencing was suc- cessful Table 2.

2014.The horse chestnut leaf miner C. orhidella causes defoliation ofhippocastanum leaves and has been shown to decrease the reproductive output of trees via both reduced seed weight Thal- mann et al.

These associations reflect the biology of the leaf miner including its recent invasion from Europe Gilbert et al.

Thus to determine how the relative abundance of the pathogen is influenced by ecological factors or across space would require sequencing at a finer resolution than offered by 16S rRNA.Distinguishing 'healthy' microbiomes from those associated with a diseased state is proving to be complex in part because of the great unexplained variation in microbiome composition and diversity across 'healthy' individuals BEURackhed et al.

2004.Unlike leaf miner presence neither spatial location nor alti- tude seemed to explain variance in bleeding canker symptoms Table 1 suggesting a more erratic dispersal biology and conse- quently that obligate vectoring of the bacterial agent by the leaf miner is unlikely.
