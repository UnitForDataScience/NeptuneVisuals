What functional role do army ant gut microbes playDue to their stability over long evolutionary time and presence across multiple species our data raise the possibility for an impor- tant functional role for the most abundant gut microbes of army ants.

For example deep sampling from two army ant species suggested differing abundance of Actinomycetales and Weissella species across colonies from the same locales how- ever sibling workers from the same colonies showed variability inthe relative abundance of these taxa Figure 2.

2011 most army ant associates grouped into a single lineage which in our analysis was made up exclusively of bacteria from army ants.

As larger amounts of sequence data for symbionts infecting a broader range of hosts become available for phylogenetic comparisons our understanding of the evolutionary history of this group is likely to improve.In contrast to these specialized bacteria Wolbachia--the most widely distributed endosymbiont of insects Zug  Hammerstein 2012 and the third most abundant microbe in our data set--was prevalent in two distantly related and geographically disparate army ant genera Aenictus and Neivamyrmex yet strikingly absent from other army ants in our study.

To achieve this we used multiplex Illu- mina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons for a total of 195 individual workers from 102 New World army ant colonies representing 28 species from the five described genera.

The collected ants were identi- fied to the genus or species level based on morphology and colony characteristics and then preserved in ethanol or acetone and stored at -20degC until further processing.We also investigated microbial communities of specimens from15 Old World army ant colonies used by Funaro et al.

Using these protocols we obtained unambiguous 16S rRNA gene sequences from 19 ant DNA samples including Old World army ants and the two Ponerinae species previously identified to host Unclassi- fied Firmicutes Tables S2-S3.

These findings suggest that army ant species differ in the numbers of bacterial cells they contain although follow- up experiments using more accurate quantitative methods are required to confirm this observation.We removed from the analysis the eight libraries where the majority of reads represented genotypes and OTUs abundant in neg- ative controls and focused on the remaining 202 libraries Fig.

However more recent efforts have detected closely related microbes in two Ponerinae species Kautz Rubin  Moreau 2013a and the NCBI database contains multiple sequences from other hosts that are at least 94 identical within the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene to the army ant symbionts.
