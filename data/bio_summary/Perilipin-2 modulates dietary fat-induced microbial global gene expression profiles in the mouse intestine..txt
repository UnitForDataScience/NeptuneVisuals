focusing on the ten enzymes link- ing b-d-fructose-6-phosphate to pep we observe the greatest contributions to the coordinated pattern of downregulation from lachnospiracea 8 of 10 enzymes downregulated other firmicutes 7 enzymes other bacteroidales 7 enzymes bacteroidaceae 6 enzymes and other bacteria 6 enzymes.

a the greatest abundances of differentially expressed enzymes were observed in the comparisons of 1 plin2-null vs. wt mice fed a hf diet 153 enzymes in 27 pathways and2 plin2-null mice fed hf vs. lf diets 164 enzymes in 26 pathways.analyses of expression fold-change revealed that wt mice fed lf and hf diets exhibited the least change in microbial pathway expression with differentially expressed genes in 25 of 42 pathways exhibiting  10 fold-change fig.

in the former enzymes linking succinate to isocitrate and acetyl-coa via oxaloacetate are upregulated in plin2 mice while in the latter enzymes linking citrate to fumarate via 2-oxaglutarate are consistently downreg- ulated in wt mice fed a hf diet.interestingly analysis of the glycolysis pathway also re- vealed consistent differential regulation of enzymes per- forming consecutive reactions fig.

perhaps reflecting the rela- tively low number of differentially expressed enzymes comparisons between plin2-null and wt mice fed a low-fathigh-carbohydrate diet exhibited more extreme distributions of fold change of expression.pca analysis of differentially expressed enzymes re- vealed significant differences in clustering between the plin2-null and wt mice fed a hf diet as well as wt mice fed hf and lf diets q value  0.05 for both additional file figure s1d.

when only transcripts with at least moderate or high levels of expression defined as 10 and  100 reads per kilobase of transcript per mil- lion mapped reads rpkm respectively in at least one sample type were considered the proportion of shared core transcripts dropped to 16.4 and 10.3 respectively with many transcripts displaying elevated expression only in a single sample type fig.

a bar charts from top to bottom show the total number of mapped microbial transcripts and the enrichment of significant differentially expressed transcripts significant transcripts identified from each of four pairwise comparisons see inset key across 17 predefined taxa.

of note previous studies have reported that flagellins secreted by motile bacteria are important determinants of host-microbiome interactions and gut homeostasis- further analyses of the 417 transcripts repre- senting flagellin from different taxa found 37 tran- scripts that exhibited significant differential expression although no clear pattern of direction of change in expression was observed additional file table s3.because of the association of specific taxa with specific differentially expressed transcripts we were interested in examining the magnitude and direction of change of all transcripts broken down by a taxonomic group fig.

however only the former exhibited significant differences in pca clusters at the level of the pathway additional file figure s1e.together these results reveal that differential expres- sion of microbial transcripts between plin2 and wt mice extends to changes in the expression of multiple enzymes having the potential to alter metabolic activity in the microbiome.a high-fat diet in the context of plin2 knockout results in coordinated patterns of expression among consecutive enzymes involved in energy metabolismin the previous section we identified several metabolic pathways exhibiting differential expression across geno- typediet groups.

all of these enzymes except isocitrate dehydrogenase ec1.1.1.41 catalyze consecutive reactions linking the glycolytic metabolites pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate pep to key inter- mediates used in the synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the utilization of reducing equivalents such coordinated patterns of expression may result in potential metabolic channeling that connect both acetyl-coa a key intermediate in fatty acid metab- olism through pyruvate and pep to oxaloacetate and subsequently to 2-oxoglutarate a-ketoglutarate and the synthesis of amino acids through nadh-dependent fu- marate reduction a part of the bacterial redox system 5. analysis of the microbial taxa in the context of this pathway revealed several taxa with relatively consistent upregulation of the enzymes that may drive channeling of pep andor acetyl coa with at least 6 of the 12 enzymes involved displaying some level of upregulation fig.

consistent with previ- ous studies we first filtered for transcripts expressed at low levels defined here as those with  5 mapped reads representing  6.5 of all mapped reads and then normalized expression levels of transcripts as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads rpkm where no expression was observed rpkm values were set to 0.non-parametric permutational multivariate analysisfor each dietarygenotype comparison in addition to examining differences in the overall distribution of microbiome composition we also investigated changes in the abundance of each taxon defined as the sum of rpkm values of transcripts assigned to that taxon.

other taxa display more heterogeneous patterns of expression for ex- ample clostridiaceae eubacteriaceae and bacilli re- spectively feature four five and four downregulated enzymes and six three and five upregulated enzymes.for the other diet-genotype comparisons although other parts of the pathway displayed heterogeneous re- sponses to diet and plin2 genotype enzymes involved in the production of pyruvate from b-fructose-6-phosphate were largely downregulated under a hf diet in both wt and plin2-null animals additional file figure s3.next with important roles in the tca cycle and fatty acid metabolism we examined the pantothenate and coa biosynthetic pathway additional file figure s4 and additional file figure s5.

together these findings suggest that unlike taxonomic composition plin2 genotype and not diet had a greater impact on the magnitude of change in transcript expression.among the transcripts that were significantly differen- tially expressed in the hf comparison plin2-hf vs. wt-hf 44 displayed fold-changes greater than 300 most of them derived from lachnospiraceae bacteroida- ceae and other firmicutes additional file table s2.these transcripts included ck514390 a flavoprotein from ruminococcus obeum which was highly expressed only in the plin2-hf samples rpkm  2412 - 2340 com- pared to  2 for the other three sample types.

furthermore taxon- specific patterns of expression were observed enzymes in the pathway associated with rikenellaceae deltapro- teobacteria clostridiaceae eubacteriaceae and baciilli were largely upregulated in the plin2-mice compared to wt mice fed a hf diet while other groups displayed more mixed patterns of expression.finally focusing on butyrate metabolism additional file figure s6 and additional file figure s7 we again identify patterns of elevated expression of con- secutive enzymes in plin2 mice relative to wt mice fed either a high- or low-fat diet that may help channel me- tabolites.

furthermore deltaproteobacteria was enriched in differentially expressed transcripts in comparisons between plin2 and wt animals raised on a hf diet in addition to dietary hf vs. lf com- parisons for both plin2 and wt mice.
