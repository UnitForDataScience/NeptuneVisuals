Focusing on the ten enzymes link- ing b-D-fructose-6-phosphate to PEP we observe the greatest contributions to the coordinated pattern of downregulation from Lachnospiracea 8 of 10 enzymes downregulated other Firmicutes 7 enzymes other Bacteroidales 7 enzymes Bacteroidaceae 6 enzymes and other bacteria 6 enzymes.

a the greatest abundances of differentially expressed enzymes were observed in the comparisons of 1 Plin2-null vs. WT mice fed a HF diet 153 enzymes in 27 pathways and2 Plin2-null mice fed HF vs. LF diets 164 enzymes in 26 pathways.Analyses of expression fold-change revealed that WT mice fed LF and HF diets exhibited the least change in microbial pathway expression with differentially expressed genes in 25 of 42 pathways exhibiting  10 fold-change Fig.

In the former enzymes linking succinate to isocitrate and acetyl-CoA via oxaloacetate are upregulated in Plin2 mice while in the latter enzymes linking citrate to fumarate via 2-oxaglutarate are consistently downreg- ulated in WT mice fed a HF diet.Interestingly analysis of the glycolysis pathway also re- vealed consistent differential regulation of enzymes per- forming consecutive reactions Fig.

Perhaps reflecting the rela- tively low number of differentially expressed enzymes comparisons between Plin2-null and WT mice fed a low-fathigh-carbohydrate diet exhibited more extreme distributions of fold change of expression.PCA analysis of differentially expressed enzymes re- vealed significant differences in clustering between the Plin2-null and WT mice fed a HF diet as well as WT mice fed HF and LF diets q value  0.05 for both Additional file Figure S1D.

When only transcripts with at least moderate or high levels of expression defined as 10 and  100 reads per kilobase of transcript per mil- lion mapped reads RPKM respectively in at least one sample type were considered the proportion of shared core transcripts dropped to 16.4 and 10.3 respectively with many transcripts displaying elevated expression only in a single sample type Fig.

a Bar charts from top to bottom show the total number of mapped microbial transcripts and the enrichment of significant differentially expressed transcripts significant transcripts identified from each of four pairwise comparisons see inset key across 17 predefined taxa.

Of note previous studies have reported that flagellins secreted by motile bacteria are important determinants of host-microbiome interactions and gut homeostasis- Further analyses of the 417 transcripts repre- senting flagellin from different taxa found 37 tran- scripts that exhibited significant differential expression although no clear pattern of direction of change in expression was observed Additional file Table S3.Because of the association of specific taxa with specific differentially expressed transcripts we were interested in examining the magnitude and direction of change of all transcripts broken down by a taxonomic group Fig.

However only the former exhibited significant differences in PCA clusters at the level of the pathway Additional file Figure S1E.Together these results reveal that differential expres- sion of microbial transcripts between Plin2 and WT mice extends to changes in the expression of multiple enzymes having the potential to alter metabolic activity in the microbiome.A high-fat diet in the context of Plin2 knockout results in coordinated patterns of expression among consecutive enzymes involved in energy metabolismIn the previous section we identified several metabolic pathways exhibiting differential expression across geno- typediet groups.

Consistent with previ- ous studies we first filtered for transcripts expressed at low levels defined here as those with  5 mapped reads representing  6.5 of all mapped reads and then normalized expression levels of transcripts as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads RPKM Where no expression was observed RPKM values were set to 0.Non-parametric permutational multivariate analysisFor each dietarygenotype comparison in addition to examining differences in the overall distribution of microbiome composition we also investigated changes in the abundance of each taxon defined as the sum of RPKM values of transcripts assigned to that taxon.
