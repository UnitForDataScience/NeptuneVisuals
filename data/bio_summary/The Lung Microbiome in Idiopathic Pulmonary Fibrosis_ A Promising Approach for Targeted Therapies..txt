Taken altogether published literature suggests that the lung microbiome might serve in the future as a prognostic biomarker a therapeutic target andor provide an explanation for disease pathogenesis in IPF.Keywords idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF interstitial lung diseases microbiome microbiotaIntroductionIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF is a rare lung disease of unknown origin which leads rapidly to death .

Interestingly bacterial DNA was not detected in five out of eight patients colonized with Pneumocystis jirovecii suggesting this fungus may impair bacterial colonization of the airways .A small study then investigated the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota in a heterogenous group of 18 patients with interstitial lung disease ILD including five with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia IIP six patients with pneumocystis associated pneumonia and nine healthy controls .

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Guidelines for diagnosis and clinical management have advanced from consensus-based in 2000 to evidence-based in 2011.

It is also very different from the mouth microbiome in comparison to healthy subjects which suggests a microbial selection in the lower respiratory tract in chronic lung disease  as each disease seems to have its own microbial signature including a loss of diversity along with dysbiosis .The first exploratory application of a culture-independent molecular technique in IPF studied the microbiome in BAL from 17 IPF patients .

Further work in the form of either culture-specific or microbe-specific sequencing is needed to formally identify these bacteria.A large study published in 2014 investigated 65 well-defined IPF patients and 44 controls which included 27 healthy controls and 17 patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD .

In every lung disease studied to date the lung microbiome is altered compared with that of healthy subjects .Given the sensitivity of the molecular technologies employed an obvious concern in many studies is contamination of samples from the upper respiratory tract when sampling providing a false representation of the true microbiome .

The diversity of the microbiome was not impacted by the treatment however the study established a connection between the composition of the microbiome and the disease phenotype regarding inflammatory and fibrotic markers in the lung mucosa suggesting once more an interaction between host immunity and microbiome.Microbiome Effect on IPF Prognosis and ExacerbationThe progression of IPF is marked with exacerbations similar to a number of chronic lung diseases.

There was a signal toward lower bacterial diversity in the IIPs but this was not statistically significant.Later on a multicenter cohort study of Correlating Outcomes with biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis COMET  retrospectively characterized the lung microbiota in 55 IPF patients with no active infection at the time of screening by sequencing the genome of the bacteria found in baseline bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF samples.
