however making this finding a bit more convo- luted a study showed that when two groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet but one received faeces from a lean mouse mice that received the fmt had an increase in weight.34 when trying to relate this to humans a clinical study in humans found there was no change in weight observed after fmt with patients continuing to eat their regular diet.37similarly another study investigating the use of fmts to treat a mouse model of ulcerative colitis found that responses were not only host-specific but strain-specific as well.38 balbc mice were responsive to fmts as a treatment for ulcerative colitis however c57bl6j mice did not show any improvement in symptom severity.38 the continual use of animal models to study the effects of fmt appears to be redundant and lacks applicability to humans.

much of what is known with respect to the microbiota and faecal microbiota transplantation comes from animal studies simulating the human disease.

by understanding some of the limitation of animal models we will be better able to design and perform experiments of most relevance to human applications.keywordsfaecal microbiota transplantation microbiome animal modelsdate received 9 january 2017 accepted 12 april 2017introductionit is widely known that faecal microbiota transplantations fmts have been very effective in treating recurrent clostridium difficile infection with reported success rates of up to 90.1 currently in canada it is one of the best treat- ment options for c. difficile infection and it is being per- formed on a routine basis.

recent studies have shown that malnutrition obesity diabetes and other conditions have a dysfunctional microbiome.2 these findings have been supported by animal studies where the human condition has been invoked despite the intestinal systems of humans and animals differing sig- nificantly.3 for example humans are unique in that the num- ber of recoverable bacteria from the stomach is considerably less than those of other hosts including rodents ruminants1division of urology department of surgery schulich school of medicine  dentistry the university of western ontario london on canada 2department of microbiology and immunology schulich school of medicine  dentistry the university of western ontario london on canada3canadian centre for human microbiome and probiotic research lawson health research institute london on canada4schulich school of medicine  dentistry the university of western ontario london on canada5division of infectious diseases department of medicine schulich school of medicine  dentistry the university of western ontario london on canadacorresponding authorjeremy p burton canadian centre for human microbiome and probiotic research lawson health research institute st josephs hospital 268 grosvenor street london on n6a 4v2 canada.email creative commons non commercial cc by-nc this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noncommercial 3.0 license which permits non-commercial usereproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the sage and open access pages httpsus.sagepub.comen-usnamopen-access-at-sage.and other mammals.4 the reason for this discrepancy is unclear.

in canada the leading treatment strategy for recalcitrant c. difficile infection is to receive faecal material which by nature is filled with microorganisms and their metabolites from a healthy individual known as a faecal microbiota transplantation.

this influx of bacteria into the gut helps to restore the microbiota to a healthy state preventing c. difficile from causing further disease.

by creating germ-free or defined microbiota variants researchers have observed the effect of a particular microorganism type on the host.

the microbiota of a mouse differs substantially from a human.

as more is discovered with regard to the microbiome of certain conditions many researchers have begun to humanize the microbiota of their mice prior to experimentation29 however this has not become standard practice.

it has been estimated that the cost of screening a donor to be us885 which includes the cost of a clinical assessment stool test and serum test.44 interim test- ing costs approximately us135 per subject.44 differences in the microbiota between successful and unsuccessful donors have not been identified.
