For example distinct strains of the model symbiont Bacteroides fragilis vary broadly in their effects on the host--some strains are tolerogenic due to the expression of the symbiosis factor polysaccharide A PSA27 some inert bacteria with no clear effects on host physiology and some highly pathogenic due to the expression of B. fragilis toxin Figure 1C.23Because of the limitations of taxonomy-based classification systems for studying the microbiota alternative approaches to defining the community composition and its effects on the host are necessary.

Much discussion has focused on which of these adaptations preceded or necessi- tated the other--did the emergence of the adaptive immune system and its near-limitless diversity of antigen recognition enable subsequent diversification of the microbiota or did colonization with a complex microbial community necessitate the development of adaptive immunity Also did the presence of a complex microbiota provide a selective advantage that enabled the rapid expansion of organisms possessing adaptive immu- nity76 Functional classifications of the microbiota based on its interactions with the immune system may provide key insights into these questions.One intriguing possibility is that the microbiota acts as an extended immunological organ--not only fulfilling basic metabolic functions on behalf of the host which are present even in symbiotic relationships that predate the evolution of complex microbiotas but also taking on roles in host defense that the host is unable to perform.

Similarly differences in the population distribution of a function over evolutionary time could provide insight into the co-evolution of the host and the microbiota and may lend further support to the notion that the selective unit in evolution is the hologenome--the combined genomic features encoded by the host genome and the microbiome.ConclusionWe are growing to appreciate that the complexity and diversity of the microbiota can have wide-ranging and dramatic impacts on the host.
