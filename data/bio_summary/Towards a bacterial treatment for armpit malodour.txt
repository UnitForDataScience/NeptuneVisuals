The malodour-causing microbiome is removed and replaced with a healthy non-odourous axillary microbiome.

The autochthonous axillary community is removed using antibacterials and antibiotics.

The axillary skin microbi- ome contains a wide diversity of bacteria where both malodour and non-odour-causing bacteria are present.

As compared to the primate axillary microbiome the human axillary mi- crobiome is much less diverse probably due to human hygiene habits.

These include the usage of antiperspirants oral medication iontopho- resis botulinum toxin injection sympathectomy excision of axillary skin axillary liposuction or laser- and microwave-based ablation of the sweat glands.

Preferably the non-odour-causing microbiota occupy the axillary skin thus not releasing axillary malodour and preventing the growth of malodour- causing microbiota.

Several patent applications were filed using lactic acid bacteria and bacilli on the axillary skin and some mention a reduced axillary malodour.

The bacterial degradation of these compounds leads to smaller compounds which become volatile and have an odour.

The microbiology of malodourous armpits is currently a topic of investigation.

The sweat glands and hair follicles are large enough warm and nutritiously rich to permit microbial activity.
