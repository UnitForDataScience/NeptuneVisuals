Meanwhile the vaginal fungal microbiome in giant pandas have some difference with the reproductive tract of other animals.Lactobacillus was present at a low percentage in giant pandas .Lactobacilli enables giant pandas to protect against Candida vaginal infections as Lactobacillus spp protects women from vulvovaginal can- didiasis .According to some statistics information for the births of the giant pandas in January-November 2017 the two giant Pandas named GPV11 and GPV13 in thirteen vaginal samples gave birth to two babies respectively.

5 to 9-year-old giant pandas belonged to Group 1.10 to 15-years-old giant pandas were named Group 2 and 16-22 years old were Group 3.reads were obtained from the thirteen samples.

This therefore highlights the area of research on vaginal fungi diversity in giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca as it has largely lacked research to date.The State Forestry Administration of China reported in the fourth national panda survey that there are 1864 wild pandas and 375 captive giant pandas in China.

Significant differences in Shannon diversity indices between Group 2 and Group 3 were tested using Wilcoxon test P  .05.  means P  .05.ConclusionOur study analysed vaginal fungal diversity of giant pandas by high- throughput sequencing of the ITS1 region.

In order to comprehensively un- derstand the vaginal fungal microbial diversity and abundance in giant pandas high throughput sequencing was used to analyse the ITS1 region based on thirteen samples taken from the pandas' vaginas which were grouped by sampling points and age.

The comparisons of Chao 1 and Shannon diversity indices among different sampling points and ages showed that DC has a greater microbial community richness and diversity than WL and BFX  while Group 1 have most microbial community richness followed by Group 2 and Group 3 B.DiscussionGiant pandas are part of an important 'flagship' species and are threatened by a series of hazards including habitat destructionlogging natural catastrophes and diseases .

The data derived from each sample was processed consistently and systematically.Both alpha and beta diversity calculations were carried out on each sample where alpha diversity refers to the diversity within each sample and beta diversity refers to patterns of similarity and differ- ences between samples.

Box-plot show Chao1 species richness indices and Shannon indices of diversity of the giant pandas' vaginal fungal communities.

Although artificial insemination techniques have achieved remarkable results there are still some factors relating to the female giant panda which are creating infertility .In this study our aim was to examine the composition of vaginal fungal microbiomes in giant pandas using high throughput sequence analysis of the ITS1 region.
