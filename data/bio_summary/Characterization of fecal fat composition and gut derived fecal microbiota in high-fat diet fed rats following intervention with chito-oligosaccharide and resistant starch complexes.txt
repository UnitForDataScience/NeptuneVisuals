in a number of studies akkermansia mucinphila has been reduced in association with a high fat diet45 and changes have been correlated with the expression of lipid metabolism and inflammation markers in diet induced mice.46 higher levels of akkermansia have been shown to be associated with a healthier metabolic status in obese humans after calorie restriction.47 in this study we show a similar loss or reduction of akkermansia in the hfd group compared to the nc group interestingly in the animals receiving co sup- plementation to their hf diet the akkermansia profile remainssimilar to the nc group suggesting a positive or stabilising effect of co. in a study with ulcerative colitis patients uc who received a diet of lowhigh resistant starch together with wheat bran the akkermansia mucinphila levels remained low in the treated uc group compared to controls48 further indicat- ing its relation to the gut inflammation status.fig.

recently considerable emphasis has been placed on the composition of the microbiota and specifically the ratio of the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes.34 previous studiesalso found an increased bacteroidetesfirmicutes ratio in obese individuals.35-37 others did not report the significant differ- ence in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes between obese and lean subjects or even found an opposite relation- ship.38 one human study investigated the relationship between the gut microbial ecology and body fat and found that the gut microbiota in obese people could be related to either a fat- or carbohydrate restricted low-calorie diet with the obese individuals having fewer bacteroidetes and more firmicutes at the baseline compared to lean controls.39 furthermore over time the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased andthat of firmicutes decreased irrespective of their diet.40 thus these phylum-wide changes in the gut microbiota structure arefig.

the current study together with previous reports provides further evidence that the influ- ence of co on body weight management and metabolism may not be associated with the direct alteration of the production of scfas in the colon but indicates that the cross-linking between rs and co could change microbial fermentation patterns resulting in an enhanced scfa production capacity which is consistent with the corresponding alteration in gut microbiota profiles.histology of colon tissue and measurement of the intestinal mucosa layer thicknessthis study revealed that the administration of co rs in par- ticular co-rs was associated with a significantly increased thickness of the mucosal layer fig.
