The basal diet consisted of the AIN-76 diet American Institute of Nutrition 1980.21 The composition of high-fat diet contained 63.8 basal diet 15 lard oil 10 saccharose 1 cholesterol 0.2 sodium cholate and 10 egg yolk powder.

The gut tissues were quickly removed after sacrifice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.Analysis of excreted fecal fatsThe analysis method of excreted fecal fats was performed according to a previous study with some modifications.22 The frozen feces were freeze dried ground and aliquots were extracted using chloroform-methanol 2  1 vv under stirring for 24 h. The chloroform phase was collected and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and then further dried using a stream of nitrogen.

Normal diet group rats fed with a basal diet without intervention21 high-fat diet group rats fed with a high-fat diet without intervention the CO RS and CO-RS administration groups rats were fed with high-fat diet and received oral administration of RS COS and CO-RS complexes respectively.

Compared with the NC group the high-fat diet HF group showed a significantly increased fecal fat excretion P  0.05 which was consistent with the report from Kritchevsky and Tepper 2005.22 The fecal fat excretion was found to be significantly promoted following the CO-RS supplementation P  0.05 in the high-fat diet compared to either the HF group or the single interventional group.

Samples of resistant starch and chito-oligosaccharide CO-RS complexes were pre- pared according to a previous method.20 Total bile acids TBA in serum were measured using a commercial assay kit follow-ing the manufacturer's instructions Jiancheng Biological Engineering Institute Nanjing China.High-fat diet animal modelAfter one week's adaptive feeding with the basal diet forty male Sprague-Dawley rats with a body weight of 150 - 10 g were randomly assigned to five groups eight rats per group normal diet group NC high-fat diet group HF CO adminis- tration group CO RS administration group RS and CO-RS administration group CO-RS.

Recently considerable emphasis has been placed on the composition of the microbiota and specifically the ratio of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.34 Previous studiesalso found an increased BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio in obese individuals.35-37 Others did not report the significant differ- ence in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes between obese and lean subjects or even found an opposite relation- ship.38 One human study investigated the relationship between the gut microbial ecology and body fat and found that the gut microbiota in obese people could be related to either a fat- or carbohydrate restricted low-calorie diet with the obese individuals having fewer Bacteroidetes and more Firmicutes at the baseline compared to lean controls.39 Furthermore over time the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased andthat of Firmicutes decreased irrespective of their diet.40 Thus these phylum-wide changes in the gut microbiota structure areFig.

The fecal microbiota profile usingamplified V4 rDNA suggested that rats in the CO-RS group developed an increased richness and diversityin the gut bacterial community compared to the high-fat diet group.

On the other hand the fermentable dietary fibers promote the production of short-chain fatty acids SCFAs via gut bacterial fermentation which have beneficial effects by selectively promoting the growth of a restricted number of bacterial genera such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.9 The measurement of intestinal SCFA production has shown that high-fat diet-induced tumor progression led to a significant reduction in acetate propionate and butyrate con- centrations in fecal samples.10 An increase in the colonic fer- mentation of dietary fibers has been demonstrated to facilitate the net portal flux of SCFA and hormones11 consequently affecting energy harvesting12 lipid homeostasis13 and intesti- nal health.14 Thus the delivery of dietary fiber to the gut is important to enhance the production of SCFAs.
