In order to test this expectation the TraDIS-deduced essen- tial genes of B. breve UCC2003 were compared to the core genomes of B. breve 1514 genes and Bifidobacterium 929 genes which were predicted based on 8 complete B. breve genomesand the genomes of 47 bifidobacterial type strains respectively.

This overlap isFigure 3. a Venn Diagram representing the overlap between the essential genes determined by TraDIS analysis for B. breve UCC2003 the Bifidobacterium and B. breve core genomes as well as B. breve core genes present in single copy.

The predicted percentage of essential genes is within the range reported from genome-wide surveys of essential genes in other microorganisms which has been shown to range from 5 to 35 of the overall gene content- -.Functional annotation of essential genes in B. breve UCC2003Functional analysis of predicted essential protein-encoding genes in B. breve UCC2003 was performed.

Moreover 11 out of the identified 453 essential genes in B. breve UCC2003 correspond to transcriptional regulators that have not been functionally characterized in bifidobacteria of which nine are predicted to be involved in signal sensing and transduction therefore representing interesting targets for future studies.Conserved essential genes in the Bifidobacterium and B. breve core genomes Comparative genomics has led to important insights with regards to evolutionary drivers and pathways of bac- terial taxa allowing the identification of genes encoding functions that can be lost or acquired through horizon- tal gene transfer as well as those that are seemingly very important as they are maintained across a particular taxonomic group.

This analysis revealed that 377 out of 400 TraDIS-predicted essential genes in B. breve UCC2003 94 were also part of the B. breve core genome Fig.

This analysis revealed that indeed a large proportion of B. breve single-copy core genes 65 are present in the Bifidobacterium core-genome including the majority of essential genes identified by transposon insertion mapping in B. breve UCC2003 81 and representatives of all functional categories Fig.

For instance among the B. breve UCC2003 essential genes that are not part of either the B. breve or Bifidobacterium core genome various predicted defence mechanisms are included such as DNA methylases and toxin-antitoxin systems.

Indeed further research is required to discern the genes that are required for successful gut colonization of B. breve UCC2003 as opposed to being essential for growth under laboratory conditions.Comparison between B. breve UCC2003 essential functions and those found for other gut bacteria.

While iron is an essential cofactor for all living bacteria specially anaerobes the fact that orthologous genes do not appear essential in Bacteroides despite their key function in the maintenance of cell homeostasis might either indicate that Bacteroides encode additional genes that can compensate the absence of one of the genes or that this systems performs other still undefined essential functions in B. breve UCC2003.Moreover the essential genes of B. breve UCC2003 that do not exhibit homology with the two Bacteroides essential gene sets include a relatively high proportion of genes which encode proteins of unknown functions or for which only general functional predictions can be obtained 46 NB.
