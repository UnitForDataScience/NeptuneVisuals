in particular the species lactobacillus casei lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus are phylogenetically and phenotypically related and are regarded together as the l. casei group within the faculta- tively heterofermentative lactobacilli .

the type strain of lactobacillus casei is atcc 393 atcc 334 cannot serve as the type because it repre- sents a different taxon the name lactobacillus paracasei and its subspecies names are not rejected and the revival of the name'lactobacillus zeae' contravenes rules 51b 1 and 2 of the inter-national code of nomenclature of bacteria.

the genomes were uploaded to the web-based ani calculator  and the calculation was car- ried out with default parameters.similarity values were compared with isddh and ani values for the same strains to determine which genes could be considered the best indicators of genome-wide diversity.strains of the l. casei group investigated and dna isolationseventy-six wild strains isolated from dairy samples previ- ously identified by different molecular techniques as belong- ing to the species l. casei l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus were investigated .nine reference strains namely lmg 6904t atcc 393t lmg 23516 l. casei atcc 334 l. paracasei lmg 6400t lmg 23522t lmg 23304tatcc 53103 strain gg l. rhamnosus were included in the study and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917t was used as negative control.the strains were maintained as frozen stocks in mrs broth sigma-aldrich containing 20  vv glycerol at-80 0c.
