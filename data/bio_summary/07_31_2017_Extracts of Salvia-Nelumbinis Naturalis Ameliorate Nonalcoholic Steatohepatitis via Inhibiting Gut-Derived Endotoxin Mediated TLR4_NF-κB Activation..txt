NASH mice developed hepatic steatosis and inflam- mation and both of which were alleviated by the 4-week SNN extracts gavage Figure Immunohistochemical IHC staining of liver sections of NASH mice showed that expression of F480 the membrane protein and an indicator of activated Kupffer cells was decreased after the SNN extract treatment Figure The mRNA concentrationsof monocyte chemotactic protein 1 MCP-1 IL-6 and TNF- in the liver were significantly increased in NASH mice and the increase was largely blocked by SNN extracts treatmentFigures Effect of the SNN Extracts Treatment on Gut Microbiota in NASH Mice.

Using methioninecholine deficient MCD diet-induced NASH model we have found that the SNN extracts can protect the liver from server damage through improving hepatic antioxidant capability However whether SNN extracts can exert a beneficial effect on liver injury related to gut- derived endotoxin has not been determined.In the present study we applied NASH mice induced by HFD supplemented with dextran sulfate sodium DSS and determined the role of endotoxin in NASH development.

Kupffer cells were isolated from C57BL6 mice and identified by fluorescently labeleddata were present as mean - SE  0.001 versus cells cultured with routine medium.1010886644220ConHF-DSSSNNa0ConHF-DSSSNNbTLR4 ConHF-DSS SNN90  Con HF-DSSSNN543210TLR4ConHF-DSS SNNTIRAPIRAK1IRAK4TRAF643210p-IBIBp-p65p65ConHF-DSS SNNTLR2 a and TLR4 b were analyzed by qRT-PCR andthe key molecules in TLR4NF-B pathway were detectedby Western blot c and d.the development of NASH indicating that endotoxin release to liver was a potential risk factor for liver inflammation.Circulating levels of gut-derived LPS are increased inwhich showed that injection of LPS to mice can induce inflammatory response in the liver  .The innate immune response provides the first line of hostincreased TNF-DAMPs by host receptors drives a cascade of signaling thatinvolves phosphorylation of IB by the inhibitor of nuclear17QA1404000 and Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai no.

Studies demon- strated that intraperitoneally injection of LPS the major com- ponent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can exaggerate liver inflammation in high fat diet HFD orhigh calorie diet feeding animals further indicating the role of gut-derived endotoxin in promoting NASH development The LPS sensor TLR4 could subsequently trigger aBNF-chemokines In addition activation of TLRs also attracts other immune cells to the infected sites thus contributing to the development of NASH.Prevention and treatment of NASH still confront great obstacles currently.

These results suggest that the SNNIntroductionNonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is a main cause of chronic liver diseases and the global prevalence is approx- imately 24 The progressive form of NAFLD has been referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH.

Although NASH represents the minority 10-20 of patients with NAFLD it can potentially progress to advanced liver disease leading to cirrhosis liver-related mortality and hepatocellu- lar carcinoma HCC Since simple fatty liver is considered to be benign determination of the risks factors of dis- ease progression is of vital importance.

Male C57Bl6 mice fed 12-week HFD exhibited obvious hepatic steatosis but no sign of inflammation in liver sections Figure Supplementation of HFD with DSS however resulted in damage in the intestinal barriers which was associated with significant hepatic steatosis combined with inflammation foci Figures and While the liver TG contents were comparable between the two groups of mice Figure the HF-DSS mice presented increased level of serum AST Figure and ALP Figure suggesting that intestinal damage might have contributed to the development of NASH.The SNN Extracts Treatment Alleviated Hepatomegaly in NASH Mice.

NASH mice developed hepatomegaly and exhibit increased body weight Table the ratio of liverbody weight of NASH mice was not different from that in control mice fed a normal chow diet Table .

Data were present as mean - SE  0.05versus Con mice  0.05  0.01 versus HF-DSS NASH mice.Liver enzymes AST ALP and LDH were significantly increased in mice fed HF-DSS diet and the SNN extract treatment resulted in markedly decreased serum AST and ALP in these mice Figures There was no differ- ence in serum ALT between NASH mice and chow diet fed mice.

However the SNN extract treated mice had lowered serum ALT compared with that in untreated NASH mice Figure The SNN Extracts Attenuated Hepatic Steatosis in NASH Mice.
