nash mice developed hepatic steatosis and inflam- mation and both of which were alleviated by the 4-week snn extracts gavage figure immunohistochemical ihc staining of liver sections of nash mice showed that expression of f480 the membrane protein and an indicator of activated kupffer cells was decreased after the snn extract treatment figure the mrna concentrationsof monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 il-6 and tnf- in the liver were significantly increased in nash mice and the increase was largely blocked by snn extracts treatmentfigures effect of the snn extracts treatment on gut microbiota in nash mice.

we have shown that the snn extracts can ameliorate nafld and related metabolic disorders in patients in a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial both in vivo and in vitro experiments in our previous studies confirmed beneficial effects of snn or its ingredients on insulin resistance and lipid accumulation 1. using methioninecholine deficient mcd diet-induced nash model we have found that the snn extracts can protect the liver from server damage through improving hepatic antioxidant capability however whether snn extracts can exert a beneficial effect on liver injury related to gut- derived endotoxin has not been determined.in the present study we applied nash mice induced by hfd supplemented with dextran sulfate sodium dss and determined the role of endotoxin in nash development.

however the snn extracts treatment had no effect on hepatic tc concentration in nash mice figure snn treatment ameliorated liver inflammation in nash mice.

significant colon shortening was observed in these mice figure a and architectural disruption of the crypts increased severity of epithelial damage and increased inflammation were detected in the colon sections figure remarkably the snn extracts treatment was shown to protect the colons from this damage figures and further determina- tion of proteins responsible for the integrity of intestinal barrier showed that the snn extract treatment significantly increased the levels of zo1 occludin and claudin-1 fig- ure moreover the elevated lps and tnf- levels observed in the nash mice could be significantly attenuated by the snn extracts treatment figures and lps aroused inflammation in kupffer cells.

data were present as mean - se  0.05  0.001 versus hfd mice.table the beneficial effect of the snn extracts on body weight and liver weight was unlikely related to changes in satiety.the snn extracts improved serum lipid profiles and enzymes in nash mice.

however since gut microbiota alteration could induce lps while chemically intestinal damage accelerates lps releaseb pathway on the snn extracts treatment might be secondary to the blockage of lps release from the intestine.conclusionsin summary we identified that intestinal damage could accel- erate the development of nash and the herbal medicine formula snn significantly attenuated liver steatosis and inflammation in experimental mice.

male c57bl6 mice fed 12-week hfd exhibited obvious hepatic steatosis but no sign of inflammation in liver sections figure supplementation of hfd with dss however resulted in damage in the intestinal barriers which was associated with significant hepatic steatosis combined with inflammation foci figures and while the liver tg contents were comparable between the two groups of mice figure the hf-dss mice presented increased level of serum ast figure and alp figure suggesting that intestinal damage might have contributed to the development of nash.the snn extracts treatment alleviated hepatomegaly in nash mice.

thus the serum tc tg and ldl-c concentrations were increased as comparedto that in chow diet fed controls figure treatment of mice with the snn extracts for 4 weeks significantly reduced the serum tg concentration whereas the serum tc concentration was restored to normal as compared to that in untreated nash mice figures and b. unexpectedly the level of hdl-c was significantly increased in nash mice while there were no differences in hdl-c between the snn- treated and untreated groups figure 6420conhf-dss snna3210conhf-dss snnb543210conhf-dss snnc0.50.40.30.20.10.0conhf-dss snnd50403020100conhf-dss snn200150100500conhf-dss snn10008006004002000conhf-dss snn806040200conhf-dss snnefghfigure 2 the effect of snn extracts on serum lipid profiles and enzymes.

however the snn extract treated mice had lowered serum alt compared with that in untreated nash mice figure the snn extracts attenuated hepatic steatosis in nash mice.

we performed 16s rdna analysis using illumine miseq and detected seven dominant phyla in the mouse feces namely bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobac- teria tenericutes deferribacteres tm7 and actinobacteria figure in nash mice the relative abundance of fir- micutes was significantly decreased and that of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria was significantly increased as compared to that in the control mice figures treatment with the snn extracts for 4 weeks resulted in partial nor- malization of the decreased abundance of firmicutes and increased abundance of proteobacteria figures andhowever the bacterial diversity of the gut microbiota was not affected by the snn extract treatment as suggested by the shannon-wiener curves figure and rarefaction curves figure .the major bacterial families identified in our analysis are shown in the hierarchical clustering heat map figure altogether 12 altered bacterial families were detected in nash mice.

in the present study we demonstrated that the herbal medicine formula snn inhibited the releasebactivation in a mouse model of nash thus demonstrating the protective effect of snn on nafld progression.accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota is associated with the development of nash  .

kupffer cells were isolated from c57bl6 mice and identified by fluorescently labeleddata were present as mean - se  0.001 versus cells cultured with routine medium.1010886644220conhf-dsssnna0conhf-dsssnnbtlr4 conhf-dss snn90  con hf-dsssnn543210tlr4conhf-dss snntirapirak1irak4traf643210p-ibibp-p65p65conhf-dss snntlr2 a and tlr4 b were analyzed by qrt-pcr andthe key molecules in tlr4nf-b pathway were detectedby western blot c and d.the development of nash indicating that endotoxin release to liver was a potential risk factor for liver inflammation.circulating levels of gut-derived lps are increased inwhich showed that injection of lps to mice can induce inflammatory response in the liver  .the innate immune response provides the first line of hostincreased tnf-damps by host receptors drives a cascade of signaling thatinvolves phosphorylation of ib by the inhibitor of nuclear17qa1404000 and natural science foundation of shanghai no.

the tlr4 mrna figure was decreased in the snn extract treated mice whereas the tlr2 mrna was unchanged figure these results suggested that the snn extracts might diminish the endotoxin effect.finally we determined the effect of snn extracts on theb pathway namely tlr4 tirap irak14 and traf6.

51activation of nf-alteration of cytokines in both serum and liver tissues furtherindicating that snn specifically blocks lps related hepaticb pathway has been reported to be beneficial for inflammatory diseases and many natural products such as berberine curcumin and resveratrol have been identified to be potential inhibitors of such cascade 8.tlrs act as a double-edged sword deficient tlr sig- naling might render the organism vulnerable to exposure to pathogenic attack while an excessive tlr response such as activation of tlr4 on the kupffer cells results in uncontrolled release of a range of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines snn is a safe therapeutic agent because it has been used for decades in china.

with the snn extract treatment the relative abundance of ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae was increased whereas the relative abundance of desulfovibri- onales and campylobacterales was reduced in comparison to that in untreated nash mice figure controlhf-dsssnnoil red o staininga10015801060405200conhf-dsssnnb0conhf-dsssnncfigure 3 the effect of snn extracts on hepatic steatosis.
