There has been significant cooling in the AntarcticPeninsula as the late 1990s arising from natural variability of the regional atmospheric circulation It has been projected that the climate in the 21st century is likely to produce periods as long as one or two decades of cooling  which is alarming because historic evidence shows that cooling may perturb ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling at a scale comparabletowhatisknownforwarmingCorrespondence Y Yang State Key Joint Laboratory of Environ- ment Simulation and Pollution Control School of Environment Tsinghua University 1 Tsinghua Garden Road Haidian District Beijing 100084 China.E-mail 11These authors contributed equally to this work.Received 27 September 2016 revised 14 March 2017 accepted23 March 2017 published online 23 May 2017M For instance cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000 led to a rapid decrease in the primary productivity of lakes 6-9 per year as well as the number of soil invertebrates more than 10 loss per year .

For variables whose effect sizes were positively and significantly Po0.05 correlated with the cooling degree the average change per degC cooling was calculated as the mean of the absolute change divided by the cooling degree in each comparison.To test the cooling effects on the microbial community structure three different complementary non-parametric dissimilarity analyses for multivari- ate data were used analysis of similarity ANOSIM  non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance adonis using distance matrices and multi-response permutation procedure MRPP .

In fact theTable 1 Effects of cooling on microbial community compositions and functional genes with three different statistical approachesData setsadonisANOSIMMRPPchanges of most environmental variables and micro- bial functional structure were not related to the degree of cooling.Carbon decomposition and nutrient cycling were both impacted by cooling.

The decrease in air temperature that is cooling could be the major driver of Re decrease since often biological activities are controlled by temperature The positive correlation r2  0.57 Po0.001 between plant biomass and CO2 flux together with the partial Mantel test results 2 suggested that a reduction in ecosystem respiration might be primarily attributed to decreased autotrophic respiration under cooling.

As CH4 production is an anaerobic process soil moisture might have stronger influence on soil CH4 fluxes than soil temperature .To determine whether the lower soil C was related to cooling we calculated the correlation between the decrease of SOC density kg C m- 2 under cooling and the temperature difference.

Here we report a soil transplant experiment from lower to higher elevations in a Tibetan alpine grassland to simulate the impact of cooling on ecosystem community structure and function.

Three years of cooling resulted in reduced plant productivity and microbial functional potential for example carbon respiration and nutrient cycling.

These results demonstrate that microbial feedbacks to cooling have the potential to differentially impact chemically labile and recalcitrant carbon turnover which could lead to strong adverse consequences on soil C storage.

Our findings are alarming considering the frequency of short-term cooling and its scale to disrupt ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling.
