available online at sciencedirectto engraft or not to engraft an ecological framework for gut microbiome modulation with live microbesjens walter23 ine' s marti'nez4strategies aimed at modulating the gut microbiota by using live microbes range from single strains probiotics or live biotherapeutics to whole non-defined fecal transplants.although often clinically efficacious our understanding on how microbial-based strategies modulate gut microbiome composition and function is vastly incomplete.

if keystone species were to be replaced by other microbes through competitive exclusion the incoming microbes would have to occupy the same niches which would mean that the community would likely maintain the same functions.

'allochthonous' bacterial strains used in probiotics and fermented foods show no ability to persist in the human gut while some strains of b. longum which are core members of the human gut microbiome show higher level of persistence.

the resulting framework postulates that the successful establishment of microbes in the gastrointestinal tract is a function of the interplay between the characteristics of the potential colonist c host-related factors h and microbiome- related mechanisms m. we discuss these three themes  and their key hypotheses  below and provide examples that demonstrate that these concepts are applicable to the gut microbiome.characteristics of the potential colonist c. according to the propagule pressure hypothesis successful invasions require a sufficient number of individuals to enter the ecosystem  which relates to the cell numbers or dose of the treatment and frequency with which they aretable 1invasion ecology hypotheses according to catford and colleagues  that encompass ecological concepts relevant for microbiome- modulating strategies based on live microbes.conceptrelevant hypothesesrelevant processesexamplesselected referencesmicrobial traits are important to overcome habitat filtering for survival.genetic characteristics origin and life history of the invading species are important as they determine relevant traits to compete with indigenous species.

microbes are more likely to possess such traits if they share an evolutionary association with the gastrointestinal tract and if host spe- cific a particular host species  and if not extensively adapted to 'in vitro' conditions which could lead to evolu- tionary 'trade-offs' that reduce fitness in the gut.most species used as probiotics survive passage through the intestinal tract.

in contrast autoch- thonous microbes either single organism mixtures or fmts can be introduced into the gut if niches are available  fitness to compete with resident species  be exploited to specifically reintroduce species that went 'missing' after antibiotic treatment or reestablish diversity in disturbed microbiomes allowing both fine-tuning and community restoration .

although various mechanisms have been established or suggested by which adminis- tered microbes exert their benefits a modulation of gut microbiota is often one of the driving motivations to apply these approaches  generation sequencing now provide unprecedented insight into the effect of live microbes on the gut micro- biome.

beneficial pre-exiting interactions between introduced microbes can facilitate invasion by synthrophy or altering ecosystem characteristics.phages that are introduced with microbes e.g.

several studies claim that allochthonous microbes with marginal persistence can induce substantial changes to gut microbiota composition that in some cases even persist long after the strains have been washed out .

strains of l. reuteri from rodents and chickens outcompete strains from other hosts in their respective hosts and possess specific traits that facilitate colonization.

these resources together with those provided through the host's diet are key components of the avail- able niches for which the incoming microbes have to compete for.microbiome related mechanisms m. competition for resources is a key mechanism that determines species coexistence  and thus the success of colonization .
