1C.Inspection of the predicted microbiota in FRC BC and FC groupsExploring the predicted taxonomic profiles at phylum level for the analysed samples clearly shows that the BC FRC and FC groups possess a distinct microbiota composition Fig.

Firmicutes in the FC- derived samples were present at a lower level in compari- son with those from BC samples 32 p-value  0.05 while the Proteobacteria phylum was shown to be present at a significantly lower abundance 18.5 p-value  0.05 in comparison to the FRC cecal samples.In order to further identify differences in microbiota com- position between BC FRC and FC the microbiota composition was explored at genus level evaluating differ- ences of bacterial genera present at an average relative abundance of  0.5 in at least one sample groupFig.

Both Free-Range Bermuda Broilers and Free- Range Bermuda Layers were dominated by the Bacter- oides genus respectively 18 and 30 followed by U. m. of Ruminococcaceae family 9 and 7 respectively Supporting Information Figure S3.Differences in cecal microbiota composition between BC FRC and FC chickensIn order to evaluate microbiota differences between Bermuda poultry BC and FRC samples we analysed the b-diversity based on unweighted UniFrac for these groupsTable 1.

Notably a statistically significant difference p-value  0.05 was detected for genes related to b- lactamase and resistance to bleomycin or vancomycin with an increase of about 66 81 and 91 in BC sam- ples respectively Supporting Information Table S6.In vitro reconstruction of the core microbiota of FC poultryCulturomics approaches were applied to those cecal sam- ples of FC and FRC animals that had been included in theFC-group Fig.

The functional microbiota char- acterization highlighted a selection in FC microbiota of those bacterial genera that are less efficient for energy recovery or host weight gain when compared to BC yet carry a lower number of genes related to antibiotic resistance.In addition we performed a first attempt to reconstruct the cecal microbiota of FC.

formerly domesticated wild-living chickens abbreviated here as FRC BC and FC respectively by means of omics approaches that used metagenomic and culturomics techni- ques and also involved bacterial cultivation approaches based on multiple culture conditions Lagier et al.

Sample categorization in FRC BC or FC was per- formed subsequent to obtaining the results from the PCoAs as reported in Fig.
