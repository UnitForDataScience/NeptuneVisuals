The correlation between the use of antibiotics in agriculture and the increase in disease risk for humans due to horizontal AR gene transfer between bac- terial foodborne donors and human recipients has been long debated as for infections caused by Enterococcus 12-14.Despite ongoing progress in understanding the effect of the diet on the composition of human gut microbiota the influence of different dietary habits on the human gut AR gene reservoir that is the resistome has been very poorly investigated and the currently available data are limited and somewhat contradictory thus rendering the objectives of the present study particularly challenging.Based on the above premises this study was aimed at eval- uating the impact of long-term omnivore ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets on the distribution of 12 selected AR genes tetO tetM tetW tetS tetK ermA ermB ermC vanA vanB mecA and blaZ playing a key role in the acquisi- tion of bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in food animal and crop production as well as in humans namely tetracy- clines macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B MLSB van- comycin and r3-lactams 3.

In support of this hypothesis foodborne commensals that enter the gastrointestinal tract can survive the gastric barrier 6 and transfer their AR genes to the resident intestinal microbiota 7 and even to human pathogens 8.In this regard some authors are convinced that a reduc- tion of the environmental AR gene pool might effectively lead to a reduction of ARs in humans 9 whereas other au- thors are more sceptic about the possibility to demonstrate the origin of AR genes and their impact on the human health 10 11.

Except for tetK a negligible three-factor interaction was seen.Conclusion A high impact of the geographical location on AR gene distribution was seen in the cohort of subjects analyzed irrespective of their dietary habits.KeywordsAntibiotic resistance genes  Dietary habits  Human feces  Human gut microbiota  Transferable resistancesAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived December 16 2016Revised April 12 2017Accepted April 18 2017IntroductionThe human body harbors a complex microbial ecosystem and the majority of human-associated microbes reside inCorrespondence Lucia AquilantiE-mail Abbreviations AR antibiotic resistance BA Bari BO Bologna CA cluster analysis DDD daily doses DNA Deoxyribonu- cleic Acid EU European Union MLSB macrolide-lincosamide- streptogramin B PCA principal component analysis PCR Poly- merase Chain Reaction PR Parma TO Turinthe intestinal tract.

tetracyclines thus contributing to the selection of AR genes and mobile genetic elements and to their stable establishment in the different animal species 27.Accordingly the question is whether different food habits and hence the consumption of foods of animal or vegetal origin might be responsible for differences in the occurrence and distribution of transferable resistances in the human gut.Given this premise the present study was primarily aimed at evaluating the impact of long-term omnivore ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets on the occurrence and distribution of determinants encoding for resistance to antibiotics which are routinely used in both agriculture and human therapy and which are commonly associated to foodborne bacteria.The impact of the intake of specific food categories as well as other factors including sex age and geographical location of the volunteers was also investigated whereas no assays were performed to assess the genetic environment e.g.

For preserved meat no statistically significant differences were found be- tween consumers and non-consumers although for tetK the higher occurrence of this determinant in consumers compared to non-consumers deserves further attention P  0.054.Effect of diet and recruiting site on clustering of volunteers based on relative AR gene detection frequenciesCluster analysisThe 12 groups of volunteers defined according to both the diet and recruiting site were grouped in two primary clusters as resulted from CA based on relative AR gene detectionfrequencies Fig.

With regards to this latter food matrix a recent research aimed at identifying and detecting tetracycline and erythromycin resistance genes in Spanish and Italian retail cheeses revealed that traditional Italian cheeses might effec- tively act as a reservoir for many antibiotic resistance deter- minants including tetK 37.A similar explanation to that suggested for ermA and tetK might be valid for the higher occurrence of vanB in the feces of volunteers who consume eggs poultry meat and fish and seafood given the documented occurrence of inducible vancomycin-resistant enterococci in these foods 38.Additional evidence was gained by CA and PCA analy- ses which clearly highlighted a geographical site-dependent rather than diet-dependent separation of volunteers with the subjects from Bari all being grouped into a unique cluster irrespective of their dietary habits.

Finally the three-factor interaction was evaluated com- paring the AR gene distribution among the three diets within each site.Cluster analysis CA and principal component analyses PCATo relate participant dietary habits and geographical origin with the occurrence of AR genes in the feces of the volun- teers PCR and nested PCR results were converted into a 144 x 12 presenceabsence 10 table including the 144 vol- unteers and the 12 AR genes of interest.

Differences in AR gene frequencies due to dietary habits were evaluated with the Pearson Chi square x2 test a  0.05.The relationship of the AR genes presence vs absence to participant sex age and daily consumption from the 11 food categories was tested by Pearson x2 test a  0.05 1 degree of freedom using 2 x 2 contingency tables obtained by grouping volunteers into two classes.

If AR determinants are considered as environmental pol- lutants 39 the findings obtained in the present study can be explained by assuming that geographical areas that are sufficiently far apart such as those chosen in this study for the enrolment of healthy volunteers will differ in the level of contamination with specific AR genes and that these genes can be disseminated among different bacterial species and distinct food habitats within the same area.
