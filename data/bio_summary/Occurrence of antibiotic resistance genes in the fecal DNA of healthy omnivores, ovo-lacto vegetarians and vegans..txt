the correlation between the use of antibiotics in agriculture and the increase in disease risk for humans due to horizontal ar gene transfer between bac- terial foodborne donors and human recipients has been long debated as for infections caused by enterococcus 12-14.despite ongoing progress in understanding the effect of the diet on the composition of human gut microbiota the influence of different dietary habits on the human gut ar gene reservoir that is the resistome has been very poorly investigated and the currently available data are limited and somewhat contradictory thus rendering the objectives of the present study particularly challenging.based on the above premises this study was aimed at eval- uating the impact of long-term omnivore ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets on the distribution of 12 selected ar genes teto tetm tetw tets tetk erma ermb ermc vana vanb meca and blaz playing a key role in the acquisi- tion of bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in food animal and crop production as well as in humans namely tetracy- clines macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b mlsb van- comycin and r3-lactams 3. the target genes were selected from among those that have very recently been ranked by martinez et al.

by contrast teto was the least abundant tet gene being detected at a frequency lower than 50.concerning the genes conferring resistance to van- comycin both vana and vanb occurred with a low frequency the first being detected exclusively by nested pcr at a freq- uency  25 and vanb occurring with a frequency of 15-35. the gene blaz which codes for resistance to r3-lactams occurred at a frequency ranging from 48 to 65 whereasmeca was detected at an even lower frequency 8.no significant differences were found in the distribution of the 12 ar genes between males and females data not shown analogously no differences were seen in the distribution of these determinants based on age with the ex- ception of ermc which occurred with a significantly higher frequency in volunteers aged  xia yong yong qiong chen jing 37 table 3. finally no sig- nificant differences were observed between the two classes of volunteers who were consuming low and high amounts of the following food categories fruit vegetables rawcooked pulses red meat and preserved meat table 3.table 2. results of pearson tests carried out to assess the effect of diet on detection frequency of the 12 selected ar genes in the feces of volunteers following an omnivore ovo-lacto-vegetarian and vegan dietargenegeneral contingency table detection frequency orthogonal contrastsomnivores versus vegans ovo-lacto- vegetariansvegans versus ovo- lacto-vegetariansomnivoresn  48vegansn  48ovo-lacto- vegetariansx2 d.f.

tetracyclines thus contributing to the selection of ar genes and mobile genetic elements and to their stable establishment in the different animal species 27.accordingly the question is whether different food habits and hence the consumption of foods of animal or vegetal origin might be responsible for differences in the occurrence and distribution of transferable resistances in the human gut.given this premise the present study was primarily aimed at evaluating the impact of long-term omnivore ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets on the occurrence and distribution of determinants encoding for resistance to antibiotics which are routinely used in both agriculture and human therapy and which are commonly associated to foodborne bacteria.the impact of the intake of specific food categories as well as other factors including sex age and geographical location of the volunteers was also investigated whereas no assays were performed to assess the genetic environment e.g.

cohort of healthy omnivoresovo-lacto-vegetarians and vegansthe list of volunteers each of whom was identified with an anonymous code along with their food habits age sex and site of recruitment is shown in supporting information table 3. their daily average consumption as expressed as g or ml day-1 of 11 potentially high risk foods for the introduc- tion of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and their genes into the human gastrointestinal tract by the three groups of volunteers is shown in supporting information table 4.pcr and nested pcrthe results of the molecular screening that was performed on the feces collected from the 144 volunteers by pcr and nested pcr are shown in supporting information table 5.all the nucleotide sequences of purified amplicons from randomly selected positive fecal specimens had a 2 97 sim- ilarity with the expected ar-genes data not shown thus con- firming the specificity of all the primer sets used in the pcr and nested pcr assays.for some target genes namely meca vana and teto positive amplification could only be achieved by nested pcr irrespective of the dietary group considered whereas for other genes namely ermb vanb tetm tetw and blaz the ma- jority of samples were already positive after the first pcrs irrespective of the dietary group considered supporting in- formation table 5. based on the limits of detection of the pcr and nested pcr protocols used that had previously been assessed at our laboratory 26 unpublished a gene copy number per gram of feces ranging from 105 ermb ermc and blaz to 107 tetm teto tetk tets tetw erma meca vana vanb and from 102 ermb ermc and blaz to 104 tetm teto tetk tets tetw erma meca vana vanb were assumed for the samples positive after the first and second round of pcr respectively.the detection frequencies of the 12 ar genes that were cal- culated within each dietary group 48 omnivores 48 ovo-lacto vegetarians and 48 vegans are shown in table 2. in general determinants coding for resistance to mlsb erm genes and tetracyclines tet genes were prevalent irrespective of the diet under consideration.

5. in support of this hypothesis foodborne commensals that enter the gastrointestinal tract can survive the gastric barrier 6 and transfer their ar genes to the resident intestinal microbiota 7 and even to human pathogens 8.in this regard some authors are convinced that a reduc- tion of the environmental ar gene pool might effectively lead to a reduction of ars in humans 9 whereas other au- thors are more sceptic about the possibility to demonstrate the origin of ar genes and their impact on the human health 10 11. however it is widely accepted that the higher the prevalence of ars in food-producing animals the higher the risk that antibiotic-resistant commensal bacteria enter the hu- man body via the food chain.

this assumption is consistent with what has been reported in other studies about the lim- ited spread in the human population of vancomycin-resistant bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre 54 however there are some other studies showing contrary results 55-57 with vanb being almost widely distributed in gut bacteria and even food-grade lactobacilli 58 59.when the effect of age and sex on the detection frequen- cies of the 12 ar genes was examined independent of dietary habits no significant differences were seen except for an ap- parently higher occurrence of ermc in the feces of volunteers aged  mo 37. these finding might suggest that adult volunteers enrolled in this study were equally exposed to ar genes or organisms or to equally frequent antimicrobial usage.conclusionfurther large-size cohort studies are needed to confirm the impact of dietary habits on the ar gene richness of gut bac- teria.

not applicable.significantly different n number of volunteersfor the remaining food categories some interesting dif- ferences emerged in the distribution of a few ar genes at a different level of significance table 3. egg consumers showed a higher frequency of both vanb p  0.050 and tetk p  0.050 in their feces compared to non-consumers whereas volunteers who were consuming milk from veg- etable sources had a significantly higher frequency of both erma p  0.050 and ermc p  0.050. moreover volunteers who consumed milk from animal sources and cheeses showed a significantly higher frequency of tetk p  0.001 whereas consumers of poultry meat had a sig- nificantly higher and lower frequency of vanb and tets re- spectively than volunteers who did not consume items from these food categories.

finally vanb occurred with a signifi- cantly higher frequency in volunteers who were consuming fish and seafood than non-consumers table 3. for preserved meat no statistically significant differences were found be- tween consumers and non-consumers although for tetk the higher occurrence of this determinant in consumers compared to non-consumers deserves further attention p  0.054.effect of diet and recruiting site on clustering of volunteers based on relative ar gene detection frequenciescluster analysisthe 12 groups of volunteers defined according to both the diet and recruiting site were grouped in two primary clusters as resulted from ca based on relative ar gene detectionfrequencies fig.

with regards to this latter food matrix a recent research aimed at identifying and detecting tetracycline and erythromycin resistance genes in spanish and italian retail cheeses revealed that traditional italian cheeses might effec- tively act as a reservoir for many antibiotic resistance deter- minants including tetk 37.a similar explanation to that suggested for erma and tetk might be valid for the higher occurrence of vanb in the feces of volunteers who consume eggs poultry meat and fish and seafood given the documented occurrence of inducible vancomycin-resistant enterococci in these foods 38.additional evidence was gained by ca and pca analy- ses which clearly highlighted a geographical site-dependent rather than diet-dependent separation of volunteers with the subjects from bari all being grouped into a unique cluster irrespective of their dietary habits.

44 in a recent large cohort study which was performedon 162 individuals from different geographical areas.of the above cited genes tetw and tetm were found to prevail in the gut and oral cavity of healthy humans respec- tively followed by teto and tetq 45. in the same study a notably higher level of these tet genes were found in the fecal samples from french and italian subjects compared with the scandinavian and uk samples tetw and tetm together with teto were also detected in the feces of healthy infants who were nourished exclusively by breastfeeding 46 thussuggesting their extremely broad distribution in the environ- ment.to date among the tet genes tetw and tetm have also been detected in various foodstuffs including cheeses 47 poultry and swine 26 vegetables at harvest 48 and even ed- ible insects 24 49. both these genes are associated with both foodborne bacteria and human gut commensals including lactobacillus bacillus clostridium streptococcus staphylococ- cus and enterobacter escherichia klebsiella lactobacillus lac- tococcus pseudomonas respectively 50 whereas tetk and tets are commonly harbored by lactobacillus both genes and lactococcus the latter gene 50.among the erm genes ermb was confirmed as the de- terminant that was most frequently found in human fecal metagenomes 51 52 as well as in food 26 it is harboured by numerous food-borne bacterial genera including bacillus enterobacter lactobacillus micrococcus pseudomonas 51. the higher frequency of ermb compared to erma and ermc in the human population 52 as well as in foods and food- associated microorganisms 51 might be attributed to both the association of this determinant with the high-mobility tn916-tn1545 family of conjugative transposons and the lo- calization of erma and ermc on the chromosome and small plasmids respectively 53.for the genes encoding the vana and vanb phenotypes a generally low occurrence was observed in the cohort as- sayed irrespective of their dietary habits thus suggesting a modest colonization of the human gastrointestinal tract with vancomycin-resistant bacteria.

moreover the diet x site interaction effect on ar gene frequencies was evaluated by x2 test using expected frequencies which were calculated through the iterative approach suggested by sokal and rohlf 25. finally the three-factor interaction was evaluated com- paring the ar gene distribution among the three diets within each site.cluster analysis ca and principal component analyses pcato relate participant dietary habits and geographical origin with the occurrence of ar genes in the feces of the volun- teers pcr and nested pcr results were converted into a 144 x 12 presenceabsence 10 table including the 144 vol- unteers and the 12 ar genes of interest.

if ar determinants are considered as environmental pol- lutants 39 the findings obtained in the present study can be explained by assuming that geographical areas that are sufficiently far apart such as those chosen in this study for the enrolment of healthy volunteers will differ in the level of contamination with specific ar genes and that these genes can be disseminated among different bacterial species and distinct food habitats within the same area.

differences in ar gene frequencies due to dietary habits were evaluated with the pearson chi square x2 test a  0.05.the relationship of the ar genes presence vs absence to participant sex age and daily consumption from the 11 food categories was tested by pearson x2 test a  0.05 1 degree of freedom using 2 x 2 contingency tables obtained by grouping volunteers into two classes.
