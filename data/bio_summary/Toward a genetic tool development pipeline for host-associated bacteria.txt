c A systematic approach to bypass restriction-modification systems based on recreating methylation patterns.middle step - bypassing the host's defense systems - is recognized as the most challenging and is discussed in more detail below.Bacteria possess a collection of innate and acquired defense systems that protect them from invasive genetic material.

Instead the most prevalent means of achieving genome editing have involved CRISPR-Cas systems prokaryotic immune systems that use short guide RNAs to direct the system's Cas nucleases to bind and cleave complementary sequences.

Further advances could include eliminating the recombinases or relying on endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems present in many bac- teria to further limit the number of required components .While many advances have been made in Cas9-mediated genome engineering in E. coli successful genome editing remains to be reported beyond only a few other bacteria  including limited examples of bacteria native to the human gut .

The efficiency of Cas9-based edit- ing with plasmid-encoded recombination templates allowed Garst and co-workers to perform high-throughput genome editing in E. coli through a methodology termedFigure 4Applying CRISPR-based tools for genome editing and gene regulation.

Genetic screens based on CRISPR-based repression therefore offer one of the most promising approaches to quickly interrogate genetic functions in diverse bacteria.Conclusions and outlookOur ability to progress a newly cultured host-associated bacterium to a genetically tractable host has greatlyimproved with advances in enhancing DNA delivery predictable expression of genes and operons and the use of CRISPR technologies for genome editing and gene regulation.

With the development of recursive editing strategies  recombineering could achieve efficient multi- plexed genome editing without direct selection of theGenetic tools for host-associated bacteria Waller et al.

They further showed that a plasmid with point mutations flanked by homology arms resulted in efficient genome editing potentially explaining why plasmid-encoded recombination templates are more effective than oligo-mediated recombination for Cas9- based editing .

These insights impact the mechanism of Cas9-mediated genome editing in bacteria and whether editing occurs through repair or through selection.49.

Furthermore these systems can be poorly conserved among related species resulting in restriction barriers that vary even between related strains .Traditional strategies to overcome these defense systems involved modifying the methylation pattern using differ- ent intermediate hosts with varying methylation patterns or incubating the plasmid with a commercially available DNA methyltransferase.

These systems can be co-opted from the host bacterium such as inducible systems that respond to the complex carbohydrates mannan chondroitin sulfate ara- binogalactan and rhamnose in Bacteroides thetaiotamicron .
