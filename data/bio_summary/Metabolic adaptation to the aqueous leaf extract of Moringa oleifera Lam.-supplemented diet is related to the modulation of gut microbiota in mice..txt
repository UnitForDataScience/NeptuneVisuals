This suggests that LM-A administration significant- ly changed the metabolic status of mice in LM group which exhibited a uniform metabolic adaption.Changes in the mouse gut microbiota composition induced by LM-A correlated with host parametersTo further explore whether one specific bacterial taxa was correlated with host metabolism we performed a multifacto- rial correlation analysis and a univariate correlation map Fig.

These data confirmed that LM-A treatment drastically altered specif- ic gut bacteria changed the initial balance of gut microbiota and may further influence the systemic metabolism of mice.Uniformed metabolic adaptation to LM-A administrationTo illustrate similarity and clustering between different sam- ples in the same group we performed the hierarchical cluster- ing analysis.

f results confirmed that banding patterns were closely related to the groups and LM-A administration caused drastic but regular and homogeneous changes in the gut microbial community structure of mice.LM-A administration drastically altered specific mouse gut bacteriaThe effect of LM-A administration on selected mouse fecal microbiota was furthered evaluated by q-PCR.

In our study LM-A significantly reduced Muc2 and occludin in the colon but not in ileum of mice the influence of LM-A on ZO-1 was not obvious Fig.

PCR-DGGE was performed to evaluate the effect of LM-A in- take on the gut microbial community structure Fig.

the significant changes in Firmicutes FIR and FirmicutesBacteroidetes FB further confirmed that LM-A administration caused a drastic shift in mouse gut microbial community structure Fig.

Meanwhile we found that LM-A administration caused drastic but regular and homogeneous changes in gut microbial community structure Fig.

Meanwhile LM-A treatment also drastically altered the spe- cific gut bacteria and the initial balance of gut microbiota.

g. Compared to the NCD group mice gavage with LM-A had significantly higher levels of bacterial LPS in serum Fig.

After 8-week feeding with normal chow diet the body weight of mice entered a stable period and one of the group received daily doses of 750-mgkg body weight LM-A by ga- vage for 4 weeks assigned as LM the other group received the vehicle assigned as NCD.
