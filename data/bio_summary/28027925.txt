as pre- viously shown  dbdb mice displayed higher plasma corticosterone levels than db mice genotype f147  37.3 p  0.001 a. interestingly ofs treatment signif- icantly reduced corticosterone concentrations in both genotypes treatment f147  6.6 p  0.05 but this effect was particularly marked in dbdb mice genotype treatment f147  4.5 p  0.05. consequently ofs-treated dbdb mice displayed plasma levels of corticosterone significantly lower than their untreated controls p  0.05.regardless of their treatment dbdb mice displayed similar plasma levels of il-1b and tnf-a than db mice b c and higher il-6 levels genotype f131  7.8 p  0.01 d. inter-estingly ofs markedly increased plasma levels of the anti- inflammatory cytokine il-10 treatment f131  11.8 p  0.01 e in particular in dbdb mice treatment x genotype f131  5.6 p  0.05. chronic ofs treatment therefore reduced cor- ticosterone release and stimulated anti-inflammatory mecha- nisms.

which was particularly increased in ofs-treated dbdb mice genotype treatment f144  4.0 p  0.05 compared to their controls water vs.ofs p  0.01 or to db groups p  0.001. as expected ofs treatment modified the gut microbiota composition in dbdb mice as previously shown in other rodent models of obe- sity .prebiotic treatment improved eating behavior and glycemic dysregulations in dbdb micein agreement with their expected phenotype dbdb mice weighed significantly more than db mice during the entire exper- iment genotype f149  207.3 p  0.001 time f7343  54.3 p  0.001. although no main effect of ofs treatment on body weight was revealed by the statistical analysis it tended to slightly and progressively reduce body weight gain as calculated for each time-point by the difference between post-treatment and pre- treatment body weight in dbdb mice compared to their untreated counterparts whereas both db groups displayed similar body weight gain overtime genotype f1343  12.4 p  0.001 geno- type time f7343  2.2 p  0.05 data not shown.

ofs treatment significantly reduced these levels in both fasted treatment f150  12.5 p  0.001 genotype x treatment f150  17.1 p  0.001 a and fed dbdb mice treatment f150  13.2 p  0.001 genotype treatment f150  9.8 p  0.01 c which displayed in both conditions basal glucose levels still higher than db groups but significantly lower than their non-treated counterparts p  0.001. blood glucose levels rapidly increased after ip glucose injection in all treated mice although the time-course of such changes depended on both geno- type and ofs treatment genotype f150  896.9 p  0.001 geno- type treatment time f4200  8.9 p  0.001 a. indeed ofs treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance in dbdb mice treatment f196  7.1 0.05 whereas it had no effect in db mice p  0.1. of note this improvement was likely underes- timated as most control dbdb mice displayed blood glucose levels higher than the highest point of the calibration curve 600 mgml.

interestingly occludin mrna expression genotype f126  11.2 p  0.01 i was reduced in the hypothalamus of dbdb mice compared to db mice in par- ticular in untreated mice dbdb vs. db water p  0.001. the same tendency was observed for hypothalamic mrna zo-1 expression genotype f123  3.4 p  0.07 dbdb vs. db water p  0.01 h. ofs treatment blunted this difference by normal- izing both zo-1 genotype x treatment f123  8.0 p  0.01 and occludin genotype treatment f126  8.2 p  0.01 mrna expression in treated dbdb mice.

consequently body weight gain was statistically higher overtime in control dbdb mice than in control db mice genotype f1175  19.6 p  0.001 genotype x time f7175  3.4 p  0.01 but not anymore after ofs treatment genotype f1168  1.2 p  0.3 genotype x time f7168  17.3 p  0.001. this was associated with a higher food genotype f1336  36.4 p  0.001 genotype x time f7336  2.2 p  0.05 b and liquid intake genotype f1343  68.5p  0.001 genotype time f7343  38.6 p  0.001 c in control dbdb mice than in db mice.

indeed ofs-treated dbdb mice consumed significantly less food than their controls p  0.001 whereas both db groups were not statisti- cally different p  0.1. similarly dbdb mice treated with ofs showed a stable close to normal liquid intake whereas untreated dbdb mice were the only ones drastically increasing their drinking over time treatment time f7161  37.6 p  0.001.as ofs has been previously shown to improve glucose tolerance in several models of obesity and diabetes   and it improved excessive eating behavior in dbdb mice we measured its impact on their glycemic dysregulations.

these findings were confirmed by calculation of the auc which was significantly reduced after ofs treatment in dbdb mice only genotype treatment f150  13.4 p  0.001 d. thus ofs treatment improved glycemic dysregulations displayed by dbdb mice although it did not significantly change plasma levels of insu- lin e and glp-1 f which remained higher in dbdb than db mice genotype f131  36.0 p  0.001 and f131  5.2 p  0.05 respectively regardless of their treatment.

in agreement with their increased food intake dbdb mice tended to display reduced mrna expression of the anorexigenic peptide cart genotype f125  4.0 p  0.057 a this reduction being significant regarding the anorexigenic peptide pomc f123  7.6 p  0.05 b. conversely the mrna expression of the orexigenic pep- tide npy was significantly increased in dbdb mice compared to db mice f126  67.5 p  0.001 c. however ofs treat- ment did not normalize the expression levels of these peptides.both db and dbdb mice also displayed similar hypothalamic tnf-a il-6 and il-10 mrna expression levels e-g3503002502001501005002.01.51.00.50a corticosteronec tnf-aplasmab il-1b654321086420water ofs.302520151050fig.
