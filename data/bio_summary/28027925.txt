E Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 substantially increased in supplemented dbdb n  8-9group p  0.05 p  0.01 for genotype effects p  0.05 p  0.01 for comparison between dbdb Water and dbdb OFS.independently of being or not treated with OFS but they differed regarding the anorexigenic cytokine IL-1b D. Indeed reduced IL-1b mRNA expression displayed by control dbdb mice compared to db mice genotype F120  20.0 p  0.001 was nor- malized by OFS treatment F120  7.6 p  0.05 water vs. OFS dbdb mice p  0.05.

Consequently OFS-treated dbdb mice displayed plasma levels of corticosterone significantly lower than their untreated controls p  0.05.Regardless of their treatment dbdb mice displayed similar plasma levels of IL-1b and TNF-a than db mice B C and higher IL-6 levels genotype F131  7.8 p  0.01 D. Inter-estingly OFS markedly increased plasma levels of the anti- inflammatory cytokine IL-10 treatment F131  11.8 p  0.01 E in particular in dbdb mice treatment x genotype F131  5.6 p  0.05.

E-F Tight-junction protein ZO-1 is increased in dbdb but no differences across groups for occludin n  8-9group p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 for genotype effects p  0.05 for comparison between dbdb Water and dbdb OFS.. Interestingly treatment with OFS improved most of these features as previously reported in obob obese mice  or in diet-induced obese rats  .

These findings were confirmed by calculation of the AUC which was significantly reduced after OFS treatment in dbdb mice only genotype treatment F150  13.4 p  0.001 D. Thus OFS treatment improved glycemic dysregulations displayed by dbdb mice although it did not significantly change plasma levels of insu- lin E and GLP-1 F which remained higher in dbdb than db mice genotype F131  36.0 p  0.001 and F131  5.2 p  0.05 respectively regardless of their treatment.

In agreement with their increased food intake dbdb mice tended to display reduced mRNA expression of the anorexigenic peptide CART genotype F125  4.0 p  0.057 A this reduction being significant regarding the anorexigenic peptide POMC F123  7.6 p  0.05 B. Conversely the mRNA expression of the orexigenic pep- tide NPY was significantly increased in dbdb mice compared to db mice F126  67.5 p  0.001 C. However OFS treat- ment did not normalize the expression levels of these peptides.Both db and dbdb mice also displayed similar hypothalamic TNF-a IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA expression levels E-G3503002502001501005002.01.51.00.50A CorticosteroneC TNF-aPlasmaB IL-1b654321086420Water OFS.302520151050Fig.

The same tendency was observed for hypothalamic mRNA ZO-1 expression genotype F123  3.4 p  0.07 dbdb vs. db water p  0.01 H. OFS treatment blunted this difference by normal- izing both ZO-1 genotype x treatment F123  8.0 p  0.01 and occludin genotype treatment F126  8.2 p  0.01 mRNA expression in treated dbdb mice.

OFS treatment significantly reduced these levels in both fasted treatment F150  12.5 p  0.001 genotype x treatment F150  17.1 p  0.001 A and fed dbdb mice treatment F150  13.2 p  0.001 genotype treatment F150  9.8 p  0.01 C which displayed in both conditions basal glucose levels still higher than db groups but significantly lower than their non-treated counterparts p  0.001.

As expected OFS treatment modified the gut microbiota composition in dbdb mice as previously shown in other rodent models of obe- sity .Prebiotic treatment improved eating behavior and glycemic dysregulations in dbdb miceIn agreement with their expected phenotype dbdb mice weighed significantly more than db mice during the entire exper- iment genotype F149  207.3 p  0.001 time F7343  54.3 p  0.001.
