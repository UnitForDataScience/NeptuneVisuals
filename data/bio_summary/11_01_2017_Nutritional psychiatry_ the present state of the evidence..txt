although described as distinct pathways it is likely that these pathways overlap synergistically and are mutually interactingobservational data on diet and mental illness in adultsseveral meta-analyses and systematic reviews have established a consistent relationship between diet and depression in adults across multiple populations which does not appear to be explained by other demographic factors or reverse causalitychildhood and maternal perinatal mental illness observational datadiet is also associated with mental health in children adolescents and women in the antenatal period.

similarly poor diet quality is associated with antenatal depression however evidence for an association between diet quality and postnatal depression and anxiety is inconsistentspecific dietary patterns individual nutrients and mental illnessnutrient dense dietary patterns that include plant foods and high-quality sources of protein are inversely associated with mental illness independent of body weight.

observational studies have examined the association with other diets including the traditional japanese diet and the norwegian diet however evidence is limited and conflicting.it is important to note that the favourable association of healthy foods and mental health outcomes is consist- ently independent of the association between unhealthy foods and poorer mental health outcomes which sug- gests that different physiological pathways may be medi- ating the potential effects of these contrasting dietary patterns.

results from system- atic reviews notable clinical and observational trials and meta-analyses were prioritised for this review.implicated pathways in diet and mental illnessthere are several pathways implicated in mental illness and that can be modulated by diet.

together this literature indicates diet is likely relevant to mental health at all stages of life.specific dietary patterns and individual nutrientsa healthy diet is generally characterised as a higher intake of fruit vegetables fish and wholegrains while a western diet in contrast is characterised by higher consumption of processed foods processed meats refined grains salty and sugary snacks and beverages.

there is evidence of an association between depression and dietary patterns such as a traditional mediterranean diets norwegian diets and japanese diets observational data suggest dietary intake of fish magnesium iron and zinc may be inversely associated with depression however an association with intake of other micronutrients has not been definitively established evidence from intervention studieswhile observational studies have reported consistent evidence for an association between diet quality and common mental disorders relatively few intervention studies have investigated this relationshippresent evidence from intervention trials are mixed with successful trials generally including at least one of the following single delivery mode e.g.

continued research is required to elucidate the impact of these as well as additional pathways including the role of homocysteine telomerase and epigenet- ics on mental health and to develop optimal strategies for interventions.most observational data to date have focused on com- mon mental disorders and there is now a need to examine dietary patterns in those with severe mental illnesses.

if indeed this is the case it suggests the presence of operative environ- mental risk factors for depression.the new field of nutritional psychiatry provides evidence for diet quality as a modifiable risk factor for mental ill- nesses.

the body of research is relatively smaller compared with adult populations however research has identified an inverse relationship between high-quality diet and mental health disturbances as well as a positive relationship between unhealthy diets and mental symptomatology such as internalising and externalising problems in children and adolescents.

in addition few studies have specifically considered diet and its effect on symptomology in patients with severe mental illnessthe role of the gut microbiome in mental illness is an emerging area with promise.

a systematic review of nine cross-sectional and three prospective studies reported an inverse relationship between high-quality diet and mental health disturbances and a positive relationship between unhealthy diets and poorer mental health out- comes in children and adolescents.

there is now a need to extend observational nutritional psychiatry research into these areas.dietary interventions for mental illnesswhile observational studies have reported consistent evidence for an association between diet quality and common mental disorders there are relatively few inter- ventions that have investigated this relationship.

similar evidence exists in early childhood where poor maternal nutrition status and early-life diet is associated with childhood emotional and behavioural dysregulation-.research investigating the potential biological pro-cesses involved in the diet and mental health relationship has primarily implicated inflammation oxidative stress and neuroplasticity with the gut microbiome as a key mediating pathway for each of these processes-.
