Recently von Laffert et al.67 observed an interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia in some cases of HS often noting a psoriasiform aspect and hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium with follicular hyperkeratosis.The occurrence of a thickening of lesional skin in some FD patients corresponding to an epidermal hyperplasia which was sometimes psoriasiform Figure 1 led us to look for the presence of epidermal hyperplasia and follicular hyperkeratosis in 26 FD patients.

These signs were described in the works of von Laffert et al.67 Histomorphological fea- tures systematically assessed included follicular hyperkeratosis hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis hyperplasia or atrophy of the follicular epithelia perifolliculitis with characterization of the nature of the infiltrate with or without inflammatory granuloma fol- licle rupture defined as a breach in the follicular wall resulting from more or less complete destruction follicular cysts polytrichia pres- ence or absence of sebaceous glands dermal fibrosis and ostial pustules.The data are presented in Table 1.

Others have provided a histological picture where it is present but not described.10111520-23 Often clinically visible the epidermal hyperplasia of FD was studied using dermoscopy by Rakowska et al.24 who described a characteristic starburst pattern which was observable in 66 of cases in a series of 9 patients.These histological features concerning follicular hyperkeratosis and epidermal hyperplasia in FD can be compared with those recently described as being a major histological characteristic of HS6725 Table 2.

The presence of follicular hyperkeratosis in FD with a histo- logical aspect of follicular plugging as described in both FD and HS735 raises the question of the role of follicular occlusion in its pathogenesis like in HS where it is currently considered as a cru- cial event.36-39The psoriasiform aspect of the epidermal hyperplasia in both FD and HS suggests a common pathological mechanism of this hyperplasia.

The significationFIGURE 4 Psoriasiform orthokeratotic epidermal hyperplasia with conserved stratum granulosum and intradermal follicular infiltrate of neutrophils in a demonstrative patient Hemalun Eosin Safran HES x100.of psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia in FD is particularly interesting to study in the light of an analogy with HS although these 2 condi- tions are clinically very different.

We also carried out a research review of medical literature3  RESULTSFIGURE 1 Epidermal hyperplasia and polytrichia.concerning these 2 features that have tended to be neglected until now in FD.

Although it is recognized that the use of transverse sections is an important tool for histological evalua- tion of hair disease8 we only performed vertical sections because our main objective for this pilot study was to assess whether the pres- ence of hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis and the follicular epithelia could be verified with reference to HS.

Interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia was present in 92 2426 of cases and was psoriasiform ie acanthosis with equally extended and club-shaped rete ridges in 88 2124 of cases Figure 4.

This feature has also been called acneiform dil- atation of the infundibulum19-11 or follicular plugging.512-14 It was found in 77 of the cases studied here and in 73 of cases in a recent series of 82 patients.15 However epidermal hyperplasia has never been reported to date as a recognized histological sign of FD as shown in our study which found it in 92 2426 of patients with a psoriasiform type in 88 2124 of cases.
