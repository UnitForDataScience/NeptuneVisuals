The SKG mice colonized with a P. copri-dominated microbiota from RA patients RA-SKG mice showed increased numbers of Th17 cells in the large intestine.

We also confirmed that approximately one-third of Japanese patients with recent-onset RA had an increased abundance of P. copri in the gut 12.Another study based on metagenomic shotgun sequencing showed that RA patients in China had an increased abundance of L. salivarius in the gut on the tooth and in the saliva 11.

We have shown that some Japanese RA patients carry increased numbers of Prevotella copri inthe intestine and have used gnotobiotic tools to show that a P. copri-dominated microbiota induced Th17 cell-dependent arthritis in mice 12.

In addition P. copri-monocolonized SKG mice showed Th17 cell-dependent arthritis development upon fungal injection thus indicating that dysbiosis dominated by P. copri contributes to arthritis development.

Moreover GF mice inoculated with the microbiota of the responders showed improved glucose metabolism with an increased abundance of P. copri in the gut.By contrast another study in Denmark showed that P. copri induced insulin resistance 32.

We also showed that the mono-colonization of GF-SKG mice with P. copri was sufficient to induce arthritis with a fungal injection.Interleukin-1 IL-1 receptor antagonist knock-out IL1rn-- mice showed T cell -mediated arthritis in under a specific-pathogen-free SPF condition in response to excessive IL-1 signaling 27.

Moreover dysbiosis has been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA in the United States China and Finland 91011.Here we review previous findings regarding the role of microbiota in human RA and mouse models of arthritis.

IgG antibody responses were observed in 13 of new-onset RA patients and 20 of chronic RA patients.

found that patients with recent-onset RA in North American populations carried an increased abundance of P. copri and a reduced abundance of Bacteroides in the gut 10.

showed that the abundance of P. copri was elevated in untreated recent-onset RA patients 10.
