The net result is that there is a lower threshold of Wnt signaling that is selected for in the proximal colon than in the distal colon which requires a higher activation of the Wnt signaling pathway but too much Wnt signaling is also not a good thing for CRC   .In other studies the levels of E-cadherin were also found to significantly affect the level of b-catenin avail- able for Wnt signaling  .

As the colonic stem cells migrate into the TA pool of progenitors they begin to lose their dependence on Wnt signaling and instead be- come dependent on BMP signaling which inhibits Wnt signaling to induce differentiation and eventually apo- ptosis of the luminal epithelial cells  .Proximal and Distal ColonWhile the Wnt notch BMP hedgehog HH and epi- dermal growth factor EGF signaling pathways are the major players in the crypt-villus axis throughout the intestine there are significant differences in the archi- tecture cell types level of signaling and extracellular matrix between the small and large intestines and be- tween proximal and distal regions within each of these structures.

Thus in addition to the allelic series of APC mutations to create the just-right level of Wnt signaling loss of E-cadherin could also have a role in pushing the Wnt levels over the CRC activation threshold .ConjectureCombining the distal location of Wnt-high tumors the role of Wnt signaling in the inhibition of Muc2 the just-right hypothesis and the effect of loss of E-cadherin on enhancement of Wnt signaling it is easy to conjecture that the gut microbiome would have a significant influence on the development of CRC.

The majority of these cells are renewed approximately once per week a rate that provides a sense of the regenerative capacity of the stem cells.Colonic Crypt Signaling PathwaysThere are several signaling pathways that are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of the colonic crypt stem cells  but the major players are the Wnt signaling pathway which maintains the stem cells in the base of the crypt the Notch-Delta signaling pathway which aids in specifying progenitors of either the secre- tory or absorptive fates   and the bone mor- phogenic protein BMP signaling pathway which is involved in differentiation and antagonism of Wnt sig- naling.

Microbial Interactions and Interventions in Colorectal CancerTERENCE VAN RAAY and EMMA ALLEN-VERCOEMolecular and Cellular Biology University of Guelph 50 Stone Road East Guelph Ontario N1G 2W1 CanadaABSTRACT Recently several lines of evidence that indicate a strong link between the development of colorectal cancer CRC and aspects of the gut microbiota have become apparent.However it remains unclear how changes in the gut microbiota might influence carcinogenesis or how regional organization of the gut might influence the microbiota.

In humans the decrease in distal Wnt signaling correlated with the high expression of the Wnt antago- nists secreted frizzled related protein SFRP and BMP2 and the low expression of the Wnt agonists hepatocyte growth factor HGF and Grem12 in the distal colon .Goblet Cells and MucinMucin-2 Muc2 is a highly glycosylated gel-forming mucin that is the major mucin component in the colon.

Higher levels of Wnt signaling in distal CRC may inhibit the mucinous phenotype as it has been found that Sox9 a target of the Wntb-catenin pathway inhibits the ex- pression of Muc2 the major component of the extra- cellular mucins .Wnt Signaling in Proximal versus Distal CRC As mentioned above the Wnt signaling pathway plays a significant role in CRC with activating mutations in this pathway found in greater than 90 of all CRCs that do not have the MSI CIMP phenotype .

Further while it might be expected that any acti- vating mutation in the Wnt pathway within the colo- rectal stem cells might lead to a cancer phenotype there is increasing evidence of a just-right level of Wnt signaling   .

In addition to Wnt target gene activation it is important to remember that one of the main readouts of active Wnt signaling is the nu- clear accumulation of b-catenin.

The selection of APC alleles to generate the just-right amount of Wnt signaling results in the elimination of cells with too much or too little b-catenin signaling.
