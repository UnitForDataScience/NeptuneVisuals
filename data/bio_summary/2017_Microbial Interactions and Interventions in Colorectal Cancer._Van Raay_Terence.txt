these ta cells will differ- entiate into primarily four differentiated cell types goblet cells mucosecreting cells enteroendocrine cells hormone-producing cells absorptive enterocytes and tuft cells prostanoid-secreting cells .

finally we discuss the potential for gut microbial modulation therapies for example probiotics antibiotics and others to target and improve gut microbial dysbiosis as a strategy for the prevention or treatment of crc.introductioncolorectal cancer crc the most common form of gastrointestinal gi tract cancer is globally the third leading cause of cancer and is associated with signifi- cant mortality .

this is consistent with a proteomics screen that found higher amounts of o-glycosylation in the distal colon from human biopsies  and a higher number of goblet cells in the distal colon in humans  although the opposite was found in rat .development of the proximal and distal colon several studies have looked at the molecular and cellu- lar differences between the proximal and distal colon which clearly identify that these two domains are physiologically different .

microbial interactions and interventions in colorectal cancerterence van raay and emma allen-vercoemolecular and cellular biology university of guelph 50 stone road east guelph ontario n1g 2w1 canadaabstract recently several lines of evidence that indicate a strong link between the development of colorectal cancer crc and aspects of the gut microbiota have become apparent.however it remains unclear how changes in the gut microbiota might influence carcinogenesis or how regional organization of the gut might influence the microbiota.

the findings of a nested case-control study that examined the correlation between nonfamilial crc development and a history of antibiotic use supported this notion since it was found that previous exposure to multiple courses of penicillins correlated with an in- creased risk of crc development .before the onset of crc related to gut inflammation however could antibiotic therapy be helpful in amelio- rating the inflammatory pathways that can lead to on- cogenesis for patients with ibd a relapsing-remitting condition the goal is to induce and maintain remission of disease partially to prevent long-term complications such as development of crc and it could be perceived that antibiotic therapy might be useful for this purpose.

the distal colon includes the remainder of the transverse colon the descending colon the sigmoid colon and the rectum and is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery and inner- vated by sacral nerves 2 to 4 and inferior mesenteric ganglion.

concomitantly these age-related microbiome changes are associated with a greater tendency towards a proinflammatory gut phe- notype with advancing age  .when things go awry the gut microbiota associated with crcthere is an ever-increasing body of evidence now supporting a role for the gut microbiome in the devel-9van raay and allen-vercoeopment of crc.

in this review we discuss several leading theories that connect gut microbial dysbiosis with crc and set this against a backdrop of what is known about proximal-distal gut physiology and the pathways of crc development and progression.

the correlation of crc with the gut microbiome is a relatively recent discovery which may explain why antibiotic therapy for crc is somewhat unexplored but a more likely explanation is that once the process of dysplasia has begun it may be difficult to stop and since there are large interindividual differences in gut micro- biota composition  it is not possible to predict the likely efficiency of a given antibiotic in removing prob- lematic microbes.

this chapter will review the pathways that lead to crc what is currently known about microbial involvement in these processes and how these may be manipulated therapeutically.the host side physiology and development in colorectal cancerin order to understand the pathogenesis of crc and how this is affected by the microbiota it is important to first understand something of the normal biology of the colon as well as what is understood about how crc can arise through mutations and aberrant signaling pathways.

given these issues as well as a potential connection between anti- biotic use and crc development the prospects of using antibiotics as cancer-preventive medicines are poor.conclusion crc treatment of the future--where do we go from hereas we continue to study the links between lifestyle host genetics and the gut microbiota in the development of crc the field is opening up to new hypotheses for prevention and treatment of disease using microbial modulation as a tool.

very recent work is starting to uncover further links between particular metabolites associated with crc with co-occurring microbes dem- onstrating that species of fusobacterium as well as of a further oral biofilm-associated genus porphyromonas may be important in crc development .the commensal-driven bystander effect hypothesisthe commensal-driven bystander effect hypothesis is an extension of the bystander effect phenotype that is usually associated with the radiation biology field whereby ionizing radiation is known to activate the release of diffusible mutagenic agents or clastogens by host cells which can go on to damage genomic dna in nonirradiated cells.

this could potentially drive cells to breach the threshold of wnt signaling resulting in a positive-feedback loop to perpetually drive the forma- tion of cancer stem cells and ultimately crc .

under permissive circumstances such dna damage may lead to malignant transformation and could contribute to other pathways of microbe-associated crc etiology discussed here in an additive fashion.the potential for treating crc with microbial modulation therapiesthe balance between dna damage and dna repair is an important equation for determining the risk of crc development but there are many contributors to both factors and it is difficult to rank how important each of these contributors may be to either promotion or pre- vention of cancer.

below we describe some of the more important differences be- tween the proximal and distal regions of the colon with a more comprehensive list in .crypt architecturethe crypt length and cell number per crypt column are significantly larger in the distal colon than in the prox- imal colon in both humans and rats  .
