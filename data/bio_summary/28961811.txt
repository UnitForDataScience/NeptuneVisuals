thus in the long-term only high fodmap foods that trigger symptoms are avoided maintaining long-term nutritional adequacy.whether the gastrointestinal microbial changes seen following fodmap restric- tion return to normal in the long term is unknown.in active crohn's disease an rct of fos supplementation sig- nificantly increased the incidence and severity of abdominal symp- toms compared with placebo although it was not known if any of these patients had concomitant ibs.a double-blind cross-over re- challenge rct in patients with inactive ibd and functional bowel symptoms who had responded to a low fodmap diet showed that fos but not gos or the polyol sorbitol induced symptoms.in a retrospective case note review of 72 ibd patients cd  52 who had previously received low fodmap dietary advice 56 reported overall symptom improvement.

there are no data supporting the use of een for extra-intestinal manifestations or penetrating disease.it has traditionally been speculated that use of een should be limited to patients with small bowel involvement however results from further meta-analyses have shown no difference in the efficacy of een when considering disease location.likewise there are no confirmatory data on the effectiveness of such treatment in severe isolated crohn's pancolitis and no data for isolated oral or perianal disease.the efficacy of een has been attributed to different mechanisms including bowel rest anti-inflammatory effects restoration of the epithelial barrier and favourable changes in the intestinal microbi- ota.as both polymeric and elemental formulas show similar effi- ciency gut rest is unlikely to be the primary mechanism.
