Most of the published data have severe methodological limitations or did not report standard- ised clinical outcomes such as remission decline in inflammation or mucosal healing.Diets reviewed included the Specific Carbohydrate Diet SCD the Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet CDED the Anti- inflammatory Diet IBD-AID the Allergen Elimination Diet IgG the Semi-vegetarian Diet SVD the low Fermentable Oligo-saccharides Di-saccharides Mono-saccharides And Polyols diet FODMAP and the Mediterranean Diet.

Thus in the long-term only high FODMAP foods that trigger symptoms are avoided maintaining long-term nutritional adequacy.Whether the gastrointestinal microbial changes seen following FODMAP restric- tion return to normal in the long term is unknown.In active Crohn's disease an RCT of FOS supplementation sig- nificantly increased the incidence and severity of abdominal symp- toms compared with placebo although it was not known if any of these patients had concomitant IBS.A double-blind cross-over re- challenge RCT in patients with inactive IBD and functional bowel symptoms who had responded to a low FODMAP diet showed that FOS but not GOS or the polyol sorbitol induced symptoms.In a retrospective case note review of 72 IBD patients CD  52 who had previously received low FODMAP dietary advice 56 reported overall symptom improvement.
