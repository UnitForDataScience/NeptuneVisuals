In both studies stronger effects were observed when exposure occurred in the first 6 months of life suggesting that a critical window exists where antibiotic exposure is particularly damaging to the developing gut microbiota.Surprisingly little is known about the impact of in utero antibiotic exposure on the infant gut microbiota although this is an area of growing interest given the widespread use of antibiotics during pregnancy 40 increasing knowledge of maternal-infant transfer of microbiota see Infant Gut Microbiota and Obe- sity and emerging evidence that even prenatal antibiotic exposure is associated with the risk of obesity see Epidemiologic Evidence Early-Life Antibiotics and Subsequent Obesity.Experimental Evidence Antibiotics Microbiota and Obesity in Animal ModelsAnimal models provide the opportunity to precisely control the dose and timing of antibiotic exposure determine their impact on weight gain and study the un- derlying biological mechanisms including the role of gut microbiota.

Moreover one of the strongest predictors of childhood obesity is maternal obesity 33 and a body of evidence suggests this may be partially explained by the vertical trans- fer of obesogenic microbiota from obese mothers to their offspring 5 33.With mounting evidence that gut microbiota contributes to weight gain and obesity there is increasing interest in targeting or manipulating gut microbiota to prevent obesity or facilitate weight loss.

Finally disturbance of gut microbiota can affect the in- tegrity and function of the gut resulting in translocation of lipopolysaccharides to the bloodstream and triggering low-grade inflammation a condition that characterizes obesity and other metabolic disorders 29.Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the two most abundant phyla in the mature gut microbiota.

How- ever the hypothesized role of microbiota is supported by evidence linking gut microbiota with metabolic dysfunction weight gain and obesity see Infant Gut Microbiota and Obesity and by studies demonstrating that early antibiotic ex- posure can significantly and permanently alter gut microbiota profiles see An- tibiotics and the Developing Gut Microbiota.

However a recent longitudinal analysis of over 160000 US children 10 demonstrated cumulative and persistent effects of antibiotic use on body mass index BMI trajectories from 3 to 15 years of age suggesting that antibiotic use beyond infancy may continue to influence weight gain throughout childhood.In contrast to the studies above a registry-based US cohort study by Gerber et al.
