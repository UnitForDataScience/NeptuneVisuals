a. tabescens mycelia were added to basal diets at concentrations of 0 0.1 0.3 or 0.9 ww.

the growth performance of early-weaned piglets displayed improvement with diets containing 0.1 and 0.3 dried mycelia powder from a. tabescens.

supplementing with 0.1 or 0.3 a. tabescens mycelia induced a 2.6- and three-fold increase in secretory immunoglobulin a siga content in the jejunal mucosa respectively but had only a marginal effect on siga in the ileal mucosa.

expression of interleukin-2 interferon-g and tumor ne- crosis factor-a in the jejunal mucosa were elevated with a. tabescens mycelia administration.

sub- merged fermentation as a mature artificial cultivation technology can lead to high production of fungal mycelia and bioactive compounds in cells after optimiz- ing the culture medium compositions and conditions cui et al.
