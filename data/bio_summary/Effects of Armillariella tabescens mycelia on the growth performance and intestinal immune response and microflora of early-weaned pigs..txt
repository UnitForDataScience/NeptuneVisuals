Optimal culture conditions for A. tabescens submerged fermentation were determined through adjusting four important growth-influencing parameters including culture time culture temperature initial pH and rotating speed.Measurements of the mycelia biomass and polysaccharide productionTo determine the mycelia biomass A. tabescens from culture medium was filtered through pre-weighted filter paper under vacuum force washed with deionized water until reducing sugars were not detected by dinitrosalicylic acid and then collected and dried at 55-60degC to a constant dry weight.

Data shown are the average - SD of three independent experiments.ARMILLARIELLA TABESCENS 1393Table 3 Effects of dietary supplementation with mycelia of Armillariella tabescens on growth performance of early-weaned pigletsItemsMycelia concentrations00.10.30.9Initial weight kg7.39 - 0.227.38 - 0.297.40 - 0.207.41 - 0.29 Final weight kg17.87 - 0.95b19.95 - 1.78a18.94 - 1.32ab19.38 - 0.69ab ADG kgday0.35 - 0.03b0.42 - 0.05a0.38 - 0.04ab0.40 - 0.02ab ADFI kgday0.62 - 0.050.69 - 0.090.64 - 0.070.69 - 0.03FCR1.78 - 0.08a1.64 - 0.06b1.66 - 0.05b1.72 - 0.05ab Diarrhea rate 2.69 - 2.49a2.43 - 3.07ab1.76 - 2.14b2.78 - 2.41aThe obtained A. tabescens mycelia were dried at 55-60degC to a specific dry weight pulverized and added to basal diets at concentrations of 0 0.1 0.3 or 0.9 ww.

This study paves the way for the large-scale production of A. tabescens mycelia by submerged fermentation and manifests that A. tabescens mycelia is a promising feed additive for early-weaned piglets via improvement of the growth performance and intestinal microflora.REFERENCESBrandtzaeg P. 2013.

A. tabescens mycelia were added to basal diets at concentrations of 0 0.1 0.3 or 0.9 ww.

The growth performance of early-weaned piglets displayed improvement with diets containing 0.1 and 0.3 dried mycelia powder from A. tabescens.

Supplementing with 0.1 or 0.3 A. tabescens mycelia induced a 2.6- and three-fold increase in secretory immunoglobulin A sIgA content in the jejunal mucosa respectively but had only a marginal effect on sIgA in the ileal mucosa.
