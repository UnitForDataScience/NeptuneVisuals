Acetic acid 5.7 mM was added to the brines of certain fermentations on day 76 S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 P. kudriazevii UCDFST 09-427 and the control fermentations and day 167 S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 P. kudriazevii UCDFST 09-427 and those containing both S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 and P. kudriazevii UCDFST 09-427.RESULTSChanges to the acidity and texture of olives with LAB and yeast additions.

These results indicate that either olives are most susceptible to contaminant spoilage yeast during the early stages of fermentation prior to the development of stable yeast communities or alternatively that there is a finite time frame in which S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 is able to successfully compete with the indigenous yeast microbiota.Notably the proportions of yeast species according to ITS sequencing differed compared to the high numbers of PGA-positive yeast cells detected in the S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 fermentations.

Displayed on the y axis are the different inoculants into the olive fermentations as follows control L. plantarum AJ11R and L. pseudomesenteroides BGM3R LpLp P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 Pk 107 CFUml S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 Sc and S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 and P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 ScPk.

Within 24 h after olive submersion the brine was inoculated to reach an estimated 107 cellsml of S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 and P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 together or L. plantarum AJ11 and L. pseudomesenteroides BGM3.

Alternatively because we only measured the microbiota for the first 71 days after olive submersion it is possible that the dominant yeast species could have changed over time and subse- quently during product storage .Introduction of S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 and P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 resulted in elevated numbers of yeast cells in the brine strongly indicating that both strains survived at least initially in the fermentations.

Although fermentations coin- oculated with P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 and S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 contained slightly firmer fruits compared to those inoculated with S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 alone this difference was not significant P  0.655 Mann-Whitney U test .

DNA se- quencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer ITS regions and comparisons to a yeast-specific ITS sequence database remarkably showed that neither S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 nor P. kudriazevii UCDFST 09-427 resulted in significant changes to yeast species diversity.

Brines inoculated with S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 or P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 initially harbored approximately log 6.0 yeast CFUml .

The rifampin variants were renamed BGM3R and AJ11R.For inoculation into pilot fermentations S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 and P. kudriavzevii UCDFST 09-427 were grown in yeast mold YM broth BD Franklin Lakes NJ at 30degC with aeration for 48 h.L.

Larger quantities of culturable yeast between log 3 to log 4 yeast CFUg were recovered from the olives inoculated with S. cerevisiae UCDFST 09-448 and continued to increase for approximately the first 20 days .
