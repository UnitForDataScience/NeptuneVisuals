these results indicate that either olives are most susceptible to contaminant spoilage yeast during the early stages of fermentation prior to the development of stable yeast communities or alternatively that there is a finite time frame in which s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 is able to successfully compete with the indigenous yeast microbiota.notably the proportions of yeast species according to its sequencing differed compared to the high numbers of pga-positive yeast cells detected in the s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 fermentations.

acetic acid 5.7 mm was added to the brines of certain fermentations on day 76 s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 p. kudriazevii ucdfst 09-427 and the control fermentations and day 167 s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 p. kudriazevii ucdfst 09-427 and those containing both s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 and p. kudriazevii ucdfst 09-427.resultschanges to the acidity and texture of olives with lab and yeast additions.

alternatively because we only measured the microbiota for the first 71 days after olive submersion it is possible that the dominant yeast species could have changed over time and subse- quently during product storage .introduction of s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 and p. kudriavzevii ucdfst 09-427 resulted in elevated numbers of yeast cells in the brine strongly indicating that both strains survived at least initially in the fermentations.

within 24 h after olive submersion the brine was inoculated to reach an estimated 107 cellsml of s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 p. kudriavzevii ucdfst 09-427 s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 and p. kudriavzevii ucdfst 09-427 together or l. plantarum aj11 and l. pseudomesenteroides bgm3.

for the custom yeast database its sequences of 875 yeast strains were compiled from genbank  and consisted of yeasts in the 2011 yeast taxonomic treatise  as well as new species described after 2011 for which its sequences were available.

larger quantities of culturable yeast between log 3 to log 4 yeast cfug were recovered from the olives inoculated with s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 and continued to increase for approximately the first 20 days .

although we found no indication that the addition of spoilage yeast affected lab species diversity and vice versa lab were detected earlier in olives containing the added p. kudriavzevii ucdfst 09-427. this finding supports other studies on olives showing that at least certain yeast strains can have direct quantitative effects on lab potentially by promoting the release of nutritive com- pounds .

although fermentations coin- oculated with p. kudriavzevii ucdfst 09-427 and s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 contained slightly firmer fruits compared to those inoculated with s. cerevisiae ucdfst 09-448 alone this difference was not significant p  0.655 mann-whitney u test .

subsequently all fermentations tended to contain between log 4.0 and log 5.0 yeast cfug olive and this number increased up to log 6.0 by day 225 .fig 3 yeast populations in pilot-scale sicilian-style fermented olives and brines.

conversely the addition of lab did not have an apparent effect on total yeast numbers or diversity.in conclusion this study shows the significant but remarkably different effects that exogenous spoilage yeast and starter culture lab have on the microbial community dynamics and outcomes of fermented foods.
