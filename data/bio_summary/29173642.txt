The Qiime pipeline was chosen to cluster reads and we used a database previously developed for a meat and fish microbial ecology study.

The presence of P. extremaustralis and P. cedrina in chicken legs would therefore require confirmation.With 6 of total reads Carnobacterium was the third dominant genus found in chicken meat microbial ecosystem.

The clustering is performed with Qiime software  using the longest reads as reference for each operational taxonomic unit OTU whereas in the strategy devel- oped by a consensus sequence of each OUT is used as reference.

For each sample read counts were divided by a normalization factor corresponding to the number of reads in the sample divided by the median value of total reads obtained for the 10 samples.Table 1Primers used in this study.Primer sequence 5030Primer nameBarcodesFragmentTargetReferenceSamples ForwardReversesize bpAll bacteriaCGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGxAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG xATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG27F-MID08534R- MID1427F-MID10534R- MID1327F-MID43534R- MID02 27FMID19534R MID21 27FMID23534R MID25 27FMID27534R MID29 27FMID31534R MID33 27FMID35534R MID37 27FMID39534R MID41 27FMID15534R MID17CTCGCGTGTC CGAGAGATAC 56716S rRNA geneV1-V3 regionTCTCTATGCG CATAGTAGTGTCGCACTAGT ACGCTCGACATGTACTACTC CGTAGACTAGTACTCTCGTG TCGTCGCTCGACGCGAGTAT ACTGTACAGTAGCGTCGTCT ATAGAGTACTQCAGTAGACGT TACACACACTTACAGATCGT TAGTGTAGATATACGACGTA CGTCTAGTAC thermosphactaGGACCAGAGGTTATCGAAACATTAACTGTAATACCAGCAGCAGGAATTGCTTdivergensCCGTCAGGGGATGAGCAGTTACACATTCGGAAACGGATGCTAATPseudomonas spp.

From the initial number of reads the remaining sequences ranged from 86.6 sample T to 98.8 sample M. Finally for the 10 samples a total of 209122 reads were used for the analysis.

EBPEBPDB method was not further used because of the misidentification of Gibsiella in sample U and the absence of detection of Acinetobacter in samples E and N. As well QiimeRDP was not further used in our study due a lack of identification of Gammaproteobacteria and a putative overestimation of Enterobacter in sample U. FROGS Silva method could not be used since analysis could be performed with only 3 out of the 10 datasets.

The only species belonging to the genus Vagococcus found in the present study was Vagococcus fluvialis samples N and E. The first isolates of this species were recovered from chicken feces and river water  and new isolates were subsequently reported from various animals pigs cattle cats horse and fishes.

The reads are trimmed and filtered with quality score threshold of 20.

The EBPEBPDB method produced similar results although Acinetobacter a genus belonging to the dominant microbiota detected with other methods and known to be present on poultry meat   was not detected .
