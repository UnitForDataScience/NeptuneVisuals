the hands of subjects in group b were prepared three times in each exper- iment at 1 30 or 60 min in a synchronized manner so that hand contact was made 1 min - 30 s after preparing the hands of the subjects in group a. sterile latex gloves were placed in the hands of the subjects as above and examined at 30 or 60 min after rubbing with product or control then removed for sampling.following contact between a and b for 10 s the hands of subjects in group a were maintained in air for 60 s to allow the antiseptic action after which the fingertips were rubbed on a tsb-na plate for 60 s one plate for each hand for bacterial enumeration as described above.contact with contaminated wet surface cwsa standard cell suspension cs od630 of 0.1 - 0.01 was obtained for each strain and maintained at 4 degc until use 1 h. sterilized filter papers fp 90 mm diameter whatman 3 m scheilcher  schuell inside sterile petri dishes were impregnated five minutes before use with 0.5 ml of cs ten-fold diluted cs-fp plates.after pre-washing as above an antiseptic or sdw as a control was applied to the hands for 60 s. after drying time 0 or at 30 or 60 min after treatment the fingertips of the subjects were pressed on cs-fp plates for 10 s one plate for each hand air dried 30 s and immediately rubbed in a tsb- na plate for 60 s for bacterial enumeration.sterile latex gloves were placed on the hands of the subjects once they were dry as described above then removed imme- diately prior to sampling at 30 or 60 min.

specifically none of the antiseptics tested showed a persistent effect on a. baumannii and antiseptics such as mct and pro showed no persistent effect in any of the trials.the cdh and cws tests are designed to reflect different realistic scenarios and may be useful for evaluation of the persistent effect of antiseptics by skin contact with dry or wet surfaces.

additionally 60 2-propanol volvol solu- tion pro soap or sterile distilled water sdw was used as a control.methodsfour different methods were used to determine the persistent activity of antiseptics a direct assay on agar plates developed to test the substantive effect of antiseptics and three methods to test the persistent activity on resident or transient microor- ganisms on the hands of volunteer students from the university of malaga.

in our study the antimicrobial effects of chx and tcn on the resident microbiota were very similar p  0.05. however a recent study showed a higher residual effect of an alcoholic solution containing chx than that of one containing triclosan  although both the methodology used and the antiseptics composition differed from those utilized in the present study.the resident microbiota showed a higher resistance to re- moval by antiseptics than transient microorganisms   .

baumannii strain that has caused hospital outbreaks of cross-infection and cross-colonization and was isolated from the university hospital of malaga  were utilized in this study.liquid medium for neutralizing antiseptics containing 0.1 peptone 0.1 l-histidine 0.3 lecithin 0.36 monopotassium phosphate 0.72 disodium phosphate 0.43 sodium chloride and 3 polysorbate80 diluted in tryp- tic soy broth tsb-na scharlau chemie spain and validat- ed following criteria established in the en1500 procedure  as well as tryptic soy agar tsa panreac spain were used in all experiments.three hand sanitizers were used 4 chlorhexidine and 60 volvol n-propanol chx albus spain 0.2 mecetronium and 45 volvol 2-propanol and 30 volvol 1-propanol mct sterilliumr lab bode-chemie gmbh germany and 0.5 triclosan 15.76 volvol 2-propanol and 49.9 volvol ethanol tcn daromixr lab jose collado spain.

for comparative purposes all antiseptics or controls were applied 60 s after the rubbing procedure established in the en1500.

tcn had the longest inhibitory effect at least 2 h on e. coli and gram positive cocci or 90 min on a. baumannii.antiseptic effect on resident microorganisms ermthe mean count of resident flora as log10 in the hands of subjects before disinfection was 4.39 cfuml 95 ci 4.01- 4.77. the use of soft soap 60 s resulted in an average rf close to 0.6 log10 at the initial time time 0. the four alcohol- based antiseptics tested were more effective against the resi- dent flora than soap with rf values between 2.0 and 3.5 being observed for mct and chx respectively at time 1 table .

table shows the effects of antiseptics on the transfer of microorganisms on the hands of subjects by contact with contaminated wet inert surfaces at 0 30 and 60 min after application.chx and tcn were able to inhibit the growth of most strains studied until one hour after application.

an antiseptic was applied to the hands 60 s then after drying 60 s the middle and index fingers of the left hand were individually tested by placing them softly for 30 s on a tsa plate.

once dry the fingertips of the subjects were rubbed in a tsb-na plate for 60 s at 1 30 60 or 90 min.

four tests were used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on i resi- dent microbiota ii nutrient agar plates nap subsequently inoculated with a test organism and transient microbiota ac- quired by contact with dry hands iii or iv a wet inert sur- face that had been artificially contaminated.

the antiseptics were applied according to european standard en1500.
