Tumor tissue samples and normal tissues adjacent to the tumor sites NATs were collected from 31 laryngeal cancer patients and the bacterial communities in laryngeal cancer patients were compared with control samples from 32 subjects.

By analyzing the 16S rRNA gene variable region 3 V3 we compared the microbiota structures in the tumor tissues and the nor- mal tissues adjacent to the tumor sites NATs from laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma LSCC patients and in control tissues from subjects with vocal cord polyps.ResultsClinical samples and sequencing data quality.

The tumor tissues and the normal tissues adjacent to tumor sites NATs were collected from laryngeal carcinoma patients and the control tissues were collected from subjects with vocal cord polyps.

However Pushalkar et al.detected changes in the oral microbiota structures between the tumor and non-tumor tissues of OSCC patients and observed a shift in the oral bacterial communities that is likely correlated with OSCC.

a Abundances  of total 16S rRNA sequences of the predominant bacterial phyla in the tumor tissue samples and the normal tissues adjacent to tumor sites NATs from laryngeal carcinoma patients and in control tissue samples from vocal cord polyps subjects.

fThe differences in the bacterial communities between the tumor tissues and the control tissues were assessed and the p2 values were evaluated using by Student's t-test.

The Richness a Shannon b and Evenness c of the samples from the tumor tissues the normal tissues adjacent to the tumor sites NATs and control tissues are compared.

In addition to studies focused on increasing our understanding of the structure of the bacterial communities in the larynx an investigation of the associations between the microbiota patterns and laryngeal carcinoma is critical.This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the ecology of the laryngeal communities in laryngeal carcinoma patients and control subjects and to elucidate the relationships between the microbiota characteristics and laryngeal carcinoma.

A comparison of the laryngeal communities in the tumor tissuesand the NATs showed higher a-diversity in cancer patients than in control subjects and the relative abundances of seven bacterial genera differed among the three groups of samples.

The structures of the bacterial communities in the tumor sites and the NATs of laryngeal carcinoma patients were different from those of the control samples collected from subjects with vocal cord polyp.
