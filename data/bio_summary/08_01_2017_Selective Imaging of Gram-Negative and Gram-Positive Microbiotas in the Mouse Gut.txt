Therefore given the limitations of existing strategies improved methods for selectively labeling gutmicrobiotas are still needed.Herein we report the development of a cell-selective labeling method for two-color fluorescence imaging of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbiotas in the mouse gut which is based on exploiting their distinctive cell wall components A. Gram-negative bacteria possess characteristic lipopolysaccharides LPS in their outer membrane.

Two-color fluorescence microscopy revealed the relative spatial localization of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbiotas in the gut B.In summary the chemical strategy developed in this work achieves cell-selective labeling of Gram-negative and Gram- positive bacteria in the mouse gut microbiota.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of selective labeling and fluorescence imaging of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a living gut microbiota.Next we evaluated 8AzKdo and Vanco-Cy3 for in situ labeling of microbiota in the mouse gut.

Nevertheless this in vivo metabolic labeling of microbiota with 8AzKdo demonstrated its potential as a LPS expression probe for different gut Gram- negative bacteria in situ.The fluorescently labeled microbiotas were then intragastri- cally administered to another group of living mice and thedistribution of the labeled Gram-negative bacteria was visualized by fluorescence microscopy in the frozen intestinal sections B.

The gut microbiotas were cultured with 8AzKdo and reacted with alkyne-TAMRA followed by labeling with Vanco-BODIPY.

An azido analogue of Kdo 8-azido-8-deoxy-Kdo 8AzKdo has been shown to be able to metabolically label LPS in several Gram- negative species including Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimu- rium Legionella pneumophila etc.We therefore envisioned that 8AzKdo might be used to selectively label Gram-negative bacteria in the complex gut microbiotas.

The distributions of previously labeled Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbiotas were visualized simultaneously.
