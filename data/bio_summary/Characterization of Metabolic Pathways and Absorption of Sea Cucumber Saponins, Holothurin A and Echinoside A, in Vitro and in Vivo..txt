A previous study reported that ginsenosides-hydrolyzing enzymes are b-glucosidase b-xylosidase a-l-arabinofurano-sidase and a- l-rhamnosidase as the sugars attached to ginsenosides are glu- cose l-arabinopyranoside l-arabinofuranoside d-xylose andorFigure 2-The total ion chromatograms TIC of control 1 using intestinal microflora and medium A control 2 using SCS extract and medium B SCS extract after biotransformed by intestinal microflora and medium C by HPLC-HRMS in negative ion mode.Figure 3-MSMS spectrum of metabolites tested by HPLC-HRMS.Figure 4-Elucidations for metabolic pathways of sea cucumber saponins EA and HA by intestinal microflora.Table 2-The concentration of HA and EA and their metabolites in urine and feces.l-rhamnose Park and others 2010.

HA and EA are holostanes with 4 monosaccharides and the chemical structures of the 2 saponins contain a sulfate group attached to C-4 of the first xylose residue.SCSs have been shown to exhibit various biological activi- ties including antimetastatic Zhao and others 2011 hemolytic Silchenko and others 2015 antitumor Yu and others 2015b and cytostatic activities Zou and others 2005.

Direct inquiries to author Yong Xue and Yuming Wang E-mail xueyongouc.edu.cn.that SCSs can be absorbed in the body after oral administration in rats Song and others 2016 Li and others 2016 and the pharma- cokinetics and biodistribution of SCSs were investigated Xiong and others 2014.

In vitro biotransformation was under the 37 degC for 48 h. Two different control experiments were conducted 1 incubations of the intestinal microflora in medium but lacking the SCSs to monitor metabolites arising from basal metabolism 2 incubations of the SCSs in medium but without intestinal microflora to monitor changes due to the non-microbial chemical transformation of precursor compounds of the substrate.The biotransformation mixtures were then prepared according to the method described in the literature Wan and others 2013 with some modifications.

HA and EA were decreased after 2 h but increased to a relatively high level at 6 h. Through enterohepatic circula- tion the secretion of HA and EA with bile acid into the intestine may explain these results Zhang and others 2007 Jin and others 2015.

Recent studies demon- strated that SCSs significantly inhibit the absorption of dietary fat and reduce obesity as well as decrease serum glucose and insulin levels and adipose accumulation Hu and others 2010 Hu and others 2012 Wang and others 2014b.

The MS andMSMS spectra of HA and EA tested by the HPLC-HRMS are shown in Figure 1.Metabolite identification and metabolic characteristic elucidation of SCSsTo understand the role of intestinal microflora on the metabolism of SCSs in the intestinal tract in vitro experiments were carried out.

In other re- searches of metabolism of saponins glycosylation Wang and oth- ers 2014a dehydration Wan and others 2013 and oxidation Liu and others 2009 could be observed but these phenomenon were not found in this work.Because there is no standard substance for M1-M6 we semi- quantitatively analyzed the metabolites using the standard curves of their parent compounds HA and EA.

The metabolism in the gut plays a pivotal role in the effi- cacy of the active food constituents Ou and Gu 2014 for exam- ple ginsenoside compound K transformed from ginsenoside Rb1 Rb2 and Rc by intestinal microflora was reported to have good anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects Wang and others 2011 Li and others 2014b.

Deglycosylation is a common reaction of many glycoside bio-active constituents by intestinal microflora such as ginsenoside Kim and others 2008 marein and flavanomarein Han and others 2016.
