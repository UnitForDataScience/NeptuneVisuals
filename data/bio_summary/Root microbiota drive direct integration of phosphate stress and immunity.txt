at least 14113 are direct phr1 targets supplementary table 12.to underscore the role of phr1 in the regulation of response to microbes we analyzed the transcriptional profile of col-0 and phr1 phl1 plants exposed to the flagellin peptide flg22.

the figure shows the average measurement of ten biological replicates for col-0 and phr1 and six for phr1 phl1c percentage of genes per cluster from figure 3 containing the phr1 binding site p1bs gnatatnc within 1000 bp of their promoters.

statistically significant differences are defined as fdr 0.05. for c d and f the number of biological replicates for every combination of genotype and pi level is always n6 evenly distributed across two independent experiments.castrillo et al.page 27extended data figure 8. phr1 controls the balance between the sa and ja regulons during the psr induced by a 35-member syncoma total number of differentially expressed genes fdr  0.01 and minimum of 1.5x fold- change in col-0 phr1 and phr1 phl1 with respect to low pi 50 um pi bacteria presence and the interaction between low pi and bacteria.

3a supplementary table 7 revealed gene sets c1 c2 c7 and c10 that were more strongly activated in col-0 than in phr1 or phr1 phl1.

8c-h supplementary table 7. a large proportion of sa-responsive genes were more strongly expressed in phr1 and phr1 phl1 than in col-0 these were strongly enriched for classical sa-dependent defense genes extended data fig.

8d e. a second group of sa-responsive genes that were less expressed in phr1 and phr1 phl1 than in col-0 lacked classical sa-dependent defense genes and were weakly enriched for genes likely contributing to psr extended data fig.

by contrast most ja-responsive genes exhibited lower expression in phr1 and phr1 phl1 extended data fig.

this agrees with the recent observation that phr1 exhibited decreased glucosinolate levels during pi starvation22.analyses of sa- and ja- up-regulated genes revealed enrichment of direct phr1 targets fig.

8c-h supplementary table 7. thus phr1 directly regulates an unexpected proportion of the plant immune system during psr triggered by our syncom.phr1 integrates plant immune system output and phosphate stress responsewe tested whether phr1 also controls the expression of plant defense genes under conditions typically used to study psr axenic growth sucrose present no microbiota involved.

9a b supplementary table 11 supplementary table 13. this indicates that phr1 negatively regulates the immune response triggered by flg22.we hypothesized that phr1 phl1 would express an altered response to pathogen infection.

the phr1 and phr1 phl1 mutants exhibited enhanced disease resistance against both hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolate noco2 and pseudomonas syringae dc3000 fig.
