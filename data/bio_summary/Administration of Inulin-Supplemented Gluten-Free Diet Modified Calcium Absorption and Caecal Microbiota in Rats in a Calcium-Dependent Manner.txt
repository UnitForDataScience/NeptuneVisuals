Experimental gluten-free diets.O--GFD of recommended Ca content OI--GFD of recommended Ca content with inulin R--GFD of reduced Ca content RI--GFD of reduced Ca content with inulin  Calcium caseinate contained 92.8 protein 2.06 fat 4.01 ash 5.12 moisture  Calcium citrate E 333iii contained 21.98 ppm of Ca  Frutafit HD contained 99.5 carbohydrates  90 inulin 10 fructose glucose sacchcrose  Mineral mix AIN-93G-MX without Ca  SS Vitamin mix AIN-93G-VM .AnimalsThe study was conducted on 32 male growing Wistar rats aged 4 weeks with similar initial body weight 103 - 4 g. All experimental protocols applied in the study were approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee Olsztyn Poland Permit Number 152007N.

The observed increase in Ca absorption in animals fed GFD with inulin is a promising result that could generate favourable surplus Ca for bone however further in vivo studies are required to assess the impact of a dietary application of inulin on calcium metabolism and bone mineralisation.ConclusionsOur results indicated that the effect of inulin on intestinal microbiota characteristics and activity and mineral utilization in growing rats depended on the dietary Ca intake in GFDs.

To verify this hypothesis a 6-weeks nutritional experiment was performed aimed to assess the impact of dietary inulin on gastrointestinal tract parameters characteristics and activity of gut microbiota SCFAs PSCFAs microbial enzymes and mineral utilization in growing rats fed GFD with reduced Ca content established as an experimental model that in some extend may correspond to a dietary conditions observed in many paediatric CD patients treated with GFD.Materials and MethodsComposition of Experimental Gluten-Free DietsThe experimental GFDs were composed mainly of gluten-free breads with Ca content recommended for rats O or gluten-free breads with reduced R Ca content supplemented or not supplemented with inulin Frutafit HD Hortimex Konin Poland Table .

Rats were divided into four experimental groups 8 per group O-fed GFD with the recommended Ca content OI-fed GFD with the recommended Ca content and inulin R-fed GFD with reduced Ca content and RI-fed GFD with reduced Ca content and inulin.

Two-way ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of Ca level recommended or reduced Ca the effects of dietary inulin diets with and without inulin I and the interactions between the investigated factors Ca x I.
