In summary differentiation between the two P. leucopus genetic clusters did not have any significant effect on the liver microbiome and horizontal transmission from the en- vironment may therefore be a stronger factor in shaping liver bacteria communities.ConclusionIn this study we characterized the liver microbiome from Peromyscus leucopus individuals dominated by the Lactobacillus genus.

Besides the detection of a number of pathogens of public health interest we identified Bartonella samples to the species level and tested the hypothesis that different Bartonella species are associated with distinct Borrelia strains as previously reported  .

The strict association between a Bartonella species closely related to B. vinsonii and B. burgdorferi reported by may therefore have been dependent on the Bartonella species involved andthe findings would thus not be applicable to the entire genus.Active Lyme disease surveillance in Canada involves the analysis of heart tissue samples from small mammal hosts e.g.

According to  permutational multivar- iate analysis of variance was then performed on these four dissimilarity matrices using the Adonis function from the VEGAN R package  to detect significant differences in the microbiomes between the two P. leucopus genetic lineages   Andre et al.

The unweighted UniFrac index did return a significant difference but with a very small r2 value .Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence across different organsAnalyses performed at the Public Health Agency of Canada on heart tissue samples from our specimens and using a nested PCR protocol targeting two Borrelia-specific markers e.g.

in the liver using NGS.This is the first study to characterize bacterial communities inhabiting the liver ecosystem of P. leucopus using next generation se- quencing.

burgdorferi infection on its reservoir host is very complex  we also focused our analyses on lung and spleen samples from P. leucopus individuals that had tested positive in PCR screening of heart tissues Leo et al.

To avoid drawing erroneous conclusions we therefore recommend systematic inclusion of several negative control samples in study designs involving low microbial biomass samples.
