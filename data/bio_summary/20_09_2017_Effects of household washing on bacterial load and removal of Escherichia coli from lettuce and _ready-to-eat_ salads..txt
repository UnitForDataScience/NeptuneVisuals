Members of the families Micrococcacea Xanthomonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae were found before rinsing and Microbacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae were found after rinsing.4  DISCUSSION In this study two washing procedures feasible to perform underPseudomonas azotoformans T D84009Pseudomonas constantinii T HAMBI 2444Pseudomonas grimontii T AF268029Pseudomonas libanensis T AF057645Pseudomonas psychrophila T AB04188599.81w--100.01u--100.01w--100.01u--99.71u1w--household conditions have been evaluated by their efficiency to remove bacteria from ready-to-eat mixed salad and from unwashed romaine lettuce.Rahnella aquatilis T AJ23342699.92u--Serratia ficaria T AJ23342894.3--1uSerratia liquefaciens T AJ30672599.7--1wWashing of mixed salad under a water tap at a flow rate of 8 Lmin significantly reduced both total aerobic count and Enterobacteriaceae count and this washing method also reduced the total aerobic count of romaine lettuce.

The ECBAand VRBD plates were incubated at 37degC for 24 hr and the TSA plates were incubated at 30degC for 3 days.In order to get an idea of the dominating culturable bacterial taxa of the total aerobic count and the Enterobacteriaceae count 2 colo- nies per sample or 36 colonies per set in total 180 colonies were randomly picked from countable plates of TSA and VRBD.

Notably the repeated washing steps under the waterShewanella putrefaciens T X81623100.01u1w--tap gave further significant reductions of both total aerobic count andEnterobacteriaceae count on both mixed salad and romaine lettuce.

Simulated household washing could at best reduce the total aerobic count and the Enterobactreriaceae count with 90and 97 respectively which due to high loads still left the leafy veg- etables with high amounts of bacteria.The results of this study show the inefficiency of tap water wash- ing methods available in the home without chemical additions to re- move bacteria from lettuce below safe limits.

The aim of the present study is to give an answer to the question if household washing of lettuce can be ex- pected to have any effect on the bacterial load in general and on con- taminating E .coli in particular.2  MATERIALS AND METHODS  LettuceSix bags of whole romaine lettuce heads Lactuca sativa and 18 bags of ready-to-eat mixed salad containing frisee Cichorium endivia var.

Unfortunately most of the sani- tizing solutions applied in industrial handling even if efficient at first fail to retain the effect when the product reaches the customer due to rapid bacterial regrowth Allende Selma Lopez-Galvez Villaescusa  Gil 2008.Thus the question remains Can the consumer influence the sit- uation by household washing with clean water This question may at first glance appear self-evident but in fact when it comes to the bacterial reduction by household washing very few data from the literature is available.

The bags were incubated at 4degC for 24 hr and then washed by immersion in water and sampled according to the procedure described above.2.4  Microbial analysisViable count was performed on 10 g salad mixture or romaine let- tuce samples.
