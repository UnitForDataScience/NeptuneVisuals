Members of the families Micrococcacea Xanthomonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae were found before rinsing and Microbacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae were found after rinsing.4  DISCUSSION In this study two washing procedures feasible to perform underPseudomonas azotoformans T D84009Pseudomonas constantinii T HAMBI 2444Pseudomonas grimontii T AF268029Pseudomonas libanensis T AF057645Pseudomonas psychrophila T AB04188599.81w--100.01u--100.01w--100.01u--99.71u1w--household conditions have been evaluated by their efficiency to remove bacteria from ready-to-eat mixed salad and from unwashed romaine lettuce.Rahnella aquatilis T AJ23342699.92u--Serratia ficaria T AJ23342894.3--1uSerratia liquefaciens T AJ30672599.7--1wWashing of mixed salad under a water tap at a flow rate of 8 Lmin significantly reduced both total aerobic count and Enterobacteriaceae count and this washing method also reduced the total aerobic count of romaine lettuce.

The total aerobic count of romaine lettuce was also reduced significantly at 8 Lmin 5.0 log10 CFUg for unwashed lettuce 4.1TABLE 1 Viable counts of ready-to-eat mixed salad and romaine lettuce washed under the water tap and after immersion in a container with waterRinsingReady-to-eat mixed saladaCounts expressed as median log10 CFUg salad of six replicates with intermedian range 25-75.bIndicates p  0.05 compared to unwashed.cindicates p  0.01 compared to unwashed in the same row.log10 CFUg after the first wash and 3.6 log10 CFUg after the fifth wash but no significant reduction in Enterobacteriaceae count could be detected Table 1.In contrast when washing at a lower water flow 2 Lmin neither the aerobic count nor the Enterobacteriaceae count was reduced sig- nificantly on ready-to-eat mixed salad.

At this water flow the structural appearance of the leaves in the mixed salad were somewhat negatively affected however the romaine lettuce appeared tougher and more resistant to the force of running water.Bacillus anthracis T AB19021799.41u1w Bacillus cereus T AE016877100.01w-- Bacillus safensis T AF34854100.01w--Microbacterium phyllosphaerae T99.81w--AJ277840ContinuesTABLE 2 ContinuedPantoea eucalypti T EF68800996.01u1uprobably due to the high initial values especially from the mixed salad with an Enterobacteriaceae unwashed count of approximately log10 5 CFUg.

On VRBD Enterobacteriaceae species such as Pantoea and Serratia were found both before and after rinsing.Pantoea eucalypti T EF68800998.2--3u3wPantoea vagans T EF688012100.0--1u2wIn the immersion experiment on mixed salad bacteria from the Bacillaceae and Pseudomonadaceae families were found on TSA both before and after water bath washing.

The ECBAand VRBD plates were incubated at 37degC for 24 hr and the TSA plates were incubated at 30degC for 3 days.In order to get an idea of the dominating culturable bacterial taxa of the total aerobic count and the Enterobacteriaceae count 2 colo- nies per sample or 36 colonies per set in total 180 colonies were randomly picked from countable plates of TSA and VRBD.

Simulated household washing could at best reduce the total aerobic count and the Enterobactreriaceae count with 90and 97 respectively which due to high loads still left the leafy veg- etables with high amounts of bacteria.The results of this study show the inefficiency of tap water wash- ing methods available in the home without chemical additions to re- move bacteria from lettuce below safe limits.

The effectiveness of irradiation on human pathogens is limited the consumer acceptance of irradiated foods remains low Parish This is an open access article under the terms of the License which permits use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.c 2017 The Authors.
