enterobacteriaceae isolates were found on vrbd both before and after the water bath washing.in the rinsing experiment of romaine lettuce bacteria from the bacillaceae and enterobacteriaceae were found on tsa both before and after rinsing table 2. members of the families micrococcacea xanthomonadaceae and pseudomonadaceae were found before rinsing and microbacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae were found after rinsing.4  discussion in this study two washing procedures feasible to perform underpseudomonas azotoformans t d84009pseudomonas constantinii t hambi 2444pseudomonas grimontii t af268029pseudomonas libanensis t af057645pseudomonas psychrophila t ab04188599.81w--100.01u--100.01w--100.01u--99.71u1w--household conditions have been evaluated by their efficiency to remove bacteria from ready-to-eat mixed salad and from unwashed romaine lettuce.rahnella aquatilis t aj23342699.92u--serratia ficaria t aj23342894.3--1userratia liquefaciens t aj30672599.7--1wwashing of mixed salad under a water tap at a flow rate of 8 lmin significantly reduced both total aerobic count and enterobacteriaceae count and this washing method also reduced the total aerobic count of romaine lettuce.

2013 lopez-velasco carder welbaum  ponder 2013. shewanella putrefa ciens is not commonly found on green leaves but associated with spoil- age of fish gram  huss 1996. it was therefore somewhat surprising to find it in the mixed salad table 2. however shewanella has been identified from hydroponic lettuce cultivation systems rivera velezzayas  llamas 2015 and its presence may indicate a marine sourceaclosest type strain t according to rdp data base seqmatch software5.bnumber of isolates from tsa.cnumber of isolates from vrbd.uisolate found before washing unwashed.wisolate found after washing washed.at the more gentle water flow of 2 lmin there was no significant decrease in the bacterial load and the same was true with the method of washing in water bath.

2013 takeuchi  frank 2000. pathogens that have internalized are known to be more resistant against sanitation agents and washing by physical means takeuchi  frank 2000. it is also worth noting that the initial values before washing of total count on romaine lettuce were 3 log10 units lower than for the mixed salad table 1. the reason to that might be the damage caused to the mixed salad during processing which increases the physical deterioration and enhances microbial growth allende et al.

notably the repeated washing steps under the watershewanella putrefaciens t x81623100.01u1w--tap gave further significant reductions of both total aerobic count andenterobacteriaceae count on both mixed salad and romaine lettuce.

simulated household washing could at best reduce the total aerobic count and the enterobactreriaceae count with 90and 97 respectively which due to high loads still left the leafy veg- etables with high amounts of bacteria.the results of this study show the inefficiency of tap water wash- ing methods available in the home without chemical additions to re- move bacteria from lettuce below safe limits.

2003. unfortunately most of the sani- tizing solutions applied in industrial handling even if efficient at first fail to retain the effect when the product reaches the customer due to rapid bacterial regrowth allende selma lopez-galvez villaescusa  gil 2008.thus the question remains can the consumer influence the sit- uation by household washing with clean water this question may at first glance appear self-evident but in fact when it comes to the bacterial reduction by household washing very few data from the literature is available.

violet red bile dextrose agar vrbd merck millipore darmstadt germany for count of enterobacteriaceae and tryptic soy agar tsa fluka missouri usa was used for total aerobic count.

the ecbaand vrbd plates were incubated at 37degc for 24 hr and the tsa plates were incubated at 30degc for 3 days.in order to get an idea of the dominating culturable bacterial taxa of the total aerobic count and the enterobacteriaceae count 2 colo- nies per sample or 36 colonies per set in total 180 colonies were randomly picked from countable plates of tsa and vrbd.

ultrasound can kill some bacteria by intracellular cavitation but the method is not very efficient especially not in the presence of solids gil selma lopez-galvez  allende 2009. washing with the addition of sanitation agents reduce bacterial levels but it also raises concern about negative long-term health effects and about environmental consequences.

we have only found one study where listeria inoculated lettuce leaves were immersed in water which reduces the number of listeria natsou rhoades smirniotis makri  kontominas 2012. however the effect of washing on the native flora was not considered.

otherwise previous studies have focused on the effi- ciency of commercially available sanitation agents and the risk of cross-contamination of specific pathogens in industrial and domestic environments baur klaiber wei hammes  carle 2005 beuchat 1998 jensen friedrich harris danyluk  schaffner 2015 nou  lou 2010 vijayakumar 2002. the aim of the present study is to give an answer to the question if household washing of lettuce can be ex- pected to have any effect on the bacterial load in general and on con- taminating e .coli in particular.2  materials and methods  lettucesix bags of whole romaine lettuce heads lactuca sativa and 18 bags of ready-to-eat mixed salad containing frisee cichorium endivia var.
