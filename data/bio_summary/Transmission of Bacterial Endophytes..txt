Second bacterial endophytes are often generalists as beneficial properties of endophytes can typically transfer to distantly related plants .

Soil bacteria can colonize the plant interior and become endophytes early via the germination environment called the spermosphere depicted in grey in Figure B or later through the rhizosphere and into the root of seedlings and adults Figure D. The above-ground plant surface or phyllosphere is colonized with a diverse community of microorganisms presenting an alternative but less-studied route of entry for bacteria that originate from rainwater bioaerosols from surrounding soil or from dust and other particles in the atmosphere and potentially gain entry via stomata Figure E. It is probable that stomata serve as a transmission route for plants of all life stages but may be especially importantfor foliar endophytes of trees.

Additionally seed endophytes can have anti-fungal properties in vitro  and inoculation with cadmium Cd resistant endophytes isolated from seed protect plants from Cd-toxicity .

In another study removal of rice seed endophytes by surface-sterilization and antibiotic treatments restricted seedling growth relative tocontrol seedlings .Given such beneficial traits it is conceivable that some plants may have formed mutualisms with bacteria that are vertically transmitted via seed ensuring continued transmission of beneficial symbionts similar to what has been described for defensive mutualisms between plants and fungal endophytes .

If on the other hand neutral processes dominate in determining the assembly of a seed-associated community we should expect to see more variation across plant individuals species and locations.The best evidence in support of vertical transfer of endophytes via seed comes from studies that demonstrate overlap in endophyte taxa between seed and seedling consistent with but not confirming vertical transfer of endophytes through seed .

While the results from these studies do not rule out vertical transfer of endophytes via seeds they suggest that most seed endophytes colonize the seed horizontally.

A study by Puente and colleagues provide some evidence of transfer of seed-borne rock-degrading endophytes of cardon cactus  consistent with the important role of these endophytes for their host's establishment on rock surfaces.

Although bacterial endophytes generally are reported to reside in intercellular spaces many tissue culture or shoot tip endophytes have been observed inside plant cells -.

rRNA abundance of these endophytes was quantified and found to be highest prior to growth or differentiation of the bud .Vertical Transfer via PollenAs mentioned above one possible way that endophytes could get into seed is via the male gametes.
