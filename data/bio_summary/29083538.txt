In a study of over 23 000 patients based on the Health Improvement Network database in the UK a consistent elevation in the prevalence of atopic diseases asthma eczema aller- gic rhinitis or hay fever and conjunctivitis was observed in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders IBS FD chronic idiopathic constipation especially in those with multiple functional gastroin- testinal disorders.Moreover autoimmune rheuma- tological diseases were significantly more frequent in patients with FD constipation and multiple func- tional gastrointestinal disorders.In an endoscopic study in London duodenal eosinophilia was more frequently observed in patients with a history of allergy and the allergic history was more common in patients with postprandial distress syndrome than in controls.The data suggest that atopic and autoim- mune diseases may lead to FD possibly via enhanced immune system activation.PATHOGENESISPsychological distressIn a study of 703 randomly selected community par- ticipants who had undergone abdominal symptom questionnaire and upper endoscopy in 2000 and fin- ished follow-up questionnaires 10 years later anxiety at baseline but not depression was found to increase the risk of developing FD by 7.6-fold in the next10 years.

The prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with FD varies in a number of studies how- ever there are no consistent differences in either the prevalence or severity of dyspepsia symptoms between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative FD.However it has been established that H. pylori eradication therapy can ameliorate symptoms in a minority of patients with FD as summarized by a meta-analysis that included 25 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5 555 patients with FD.

If there is a prolonged symptom relief after eradication the patient is no lon- ger considered to have had FD but H. pylori- associated dyspepsia.Gastroduodenal dysfunctionSlow gastric emptying has been observed in 25 of patients with FDand it is traditionally considered a characteristic feature of postprandial distress syn- drome.However some studies showed that there was no difference in delayed gastric emptying between patients with postprandial distress and those with epigastric pain syndrome.Further symptoms correlate very poorly if at all with gastric emptying in FD.Abnormal gastric accommodation occursin a subset of patients with FD up to 40 and is linked to postprandial distress not epigastric pain syndrome.

pylori eradication suggesting that patients with epigastric pain syndrome may benefit more than those with postprandial distress syndrome from the eradication of H. pylori.The Kyoto Consensus pro- posed that patients with FD and H. pylori infection who respond to eradication therapy should be cate- gorized as H. pylori-associated dyspepsia in order to distinguish this subset of patients from those with true FD.Acid suppressionAcid suppression has been conventionally used to reduce the symptoms of FD.

Advances in understanding FD may alter clinical practice and the treatment of duodenal inflammation or microbiome alterations may lead to a cure for a subset of these patients in the future.KEY WORDS disease model duodenum dyspepsia eosinophilia functional.INTRODUCTIONGlobally functional dyspepsia FD is one of the most commonly diagnosed functional gastrointesti- nal disorders.

Notably a signifi- cant number of patients 36 developed both dys- pepsia and IBS.Paula and colleagues investigated whether antibiotic treatment for non-enteric infec- tions could be a potential risk factor for functional gastrointestinal disorders.In a nested case-control study in Olmsted County in the USA based on a follow-up survey 316 participants developed new- onset functional gastrointestinal disorder including FD.

Pictograms with descriptive explanations have been developed and may improve patients' understanding and physicians' evaluation of the disease.However in clinical practice many patients present with various symptoms including those characteristic of FD with or without symptoms of gas- troesophageal reflux such as heartburn or regurgita- tion or with symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome IBS such as lower abdominal pain bowel disturbance often with bloating.Fur- thermore in FD extraintestinal symptoms are preva- lent including fatigue insomnia and pain outside the gastrointestinal tract until recently defying explanation.ClassificationFD according to Rome IV comprises two distinct syndromes postprandial distress syndrome and epi- gastric pain syndrome.

Bisschops and colleagues monitored symp- toms of 218 patients with FD and 28 healthy volunteers every 15 min for 240 min after a standard solid meal showing that ingesting a meal induced FD symptoms in most patients 79 even though many of them self-reported that their symptoms were not meal-induced.

Vakil and colleagues recruited patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and conducted upper endoscopy and 24-h pH-metry.Approximately halfc 2017 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch Chinese Society of Gastroenterology Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University Schoolof Medicine and John Wiley  Sons Australia LtdJournal of Digestive Diseases 2017 18 667-677Dyspepsia and duodenal eosinophilia669the primary care group with postprandial distress syndrome or epigastric pain syndrome had concomi- tant gastroesophageal reflux disease while nearly 30 of them had predominant symptoms of heart- burn and regurgitation.A unifying pathophysiolog- ical mechanism may account for the overlap and for example a subset of patients with FD have gastric disaccommodation and gastric disaccommodation is linked to increased transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations.The Rome IV Consensus to its credit suggests that separating gastroesophageal reflex disease from FD may be artificial and it should not necessarily be classified as gastroesophageal reflex disease in future trials.Another diagnostic dilemma is how to differentiate between FD and gastroparesis.

Recent studies also suggested that anxiety was correlated with impaired gastric accom- modation in patients with postprandial distress syn- drome.Overall delayed gastric emptying impaired gastric accommodation and gastric hypersensitivity are consistent pathophysiological changes observed in groups with FD but none of these abnormalities is strongly linked to any specific symptom except for the correlation between the failure of fundic relaxa- tion and early satiety.Duodenal hypersensitivity to acid and distention has been identified in patients with FD.
