Results can be of interest for producing probiotic table olives and open new research challenges on the causes of inoculum vanishing during the storage phase.Keywords Green Spanish-style table olives probiotic starter culture large-scale fermentation inoculum survivalINTRODUCTIONTable olives are a fermented vegetable of the Mediterranean basin with many centuries of history.

The adhesion of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria on the epidermis of the processed olives   and the formation of true biofilms on green Spanish-style table olives     have been reported recently.

The study was carried out at JOLCA S.A. facilities in Huevar del Aljarafe Seville Spain using Manzanilla olives picked by hand at the green maturation stage.The experiments were always carried out in 16000 L industrial fermentation vessels containing 9856 kg olives and 6374 L brine.

Processing early in the season September showed a favorable effect on fermentation and strain predominance on olives particularly when using acidified brines containing 25 L HClvessel but caused the disappearance of the target strain from both brines and olives during the storage phase.

used single and combined cultures of L. pentosus and Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from industrially fermented olives for processing Halkidiki olives in 14 L capacity plastic vessels.

Recently  made a review of the most relevant biotechnological innovations in table olives based on both traditional and innovative starter cultures.Despite the substantial effort devoted to the use of starter culture in green Spanish-style table olives the fermentation process at industrial scale remains virtually spontaneous.

Inoculated fermentation of green olives with potential probiotic Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus plantarum starter cultures isolated from industrially fermented olives.

The study was performed in two successive seasons 20112012 and 20122013 using about 150 tons of olives.

The biofilm formation was also observed on Conservolea natural black olives processed with the functional starter culture L. pentosus B281 alone or in co-inoculation with Pichia membranifaciens.

The use of these conditions was forced by industry to prevent any risk that might compromise the quality and safety of the product involved in the experiment 16 fermentation tanks of 10-ton olives for a total of about 157.696 kg of fruits.Tentative Inoculation 20112012 SeasonThe results obtained in 20112012 season constituted the basis for the selection of the treatments applied in the following trial of experiments 20122013 season.
