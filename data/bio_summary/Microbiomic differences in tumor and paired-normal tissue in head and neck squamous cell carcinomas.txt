however when analyzing oral cavityoropharynx samples alone actinobacteria and actinomyces approached signifi- cance in low-stage patients relative to high-stage patients p  0.100 p  0.192 and parvimonas remained signifi- cantly relatively decreased among low-stage patients com- pared to high-stage patients p  0.006. when analyzing hypopharyngeallaryngeal samples alone actinobacteria remained significantly relatively increased in low-stage patients p  0.031 while actinomyces and parvimonas were not significantly different between low-stage and high-stage groups p  0.645 p  0.790.discussionin this study we sought to describe the oral microbiome of individuals with hnscc and to compare the local microbiome of their tumors with neighboring normal tissue.

this difference wasstatistically significant in the normal group phylum actino- bacteria p  0.002 genus actinomyces p  0.023 genus par- vimonas p  0.033 but only approached significance in the tumor group phylum actinobacteria p  0.067 genus acti- nomyces p  0.052 genus parvimonas p  0.247.as t-stage was significantly associated with tissue loca- tion oral cavityoropharynx versus hypopharynxlarynx we proceeded to stratify samples based on tissue location fig.

f-testing on cluster strength wilcoxon signed-rank testing on differential relative abundances of paired tumor-normal samples and wilcoxon rank-sum testing on the association of t-stage with relative abundances were conducted in r.results we observed no significant difference in measures of alpha diversity between tumor and normal tissue shannon index p  0.13 phylogenetic diversity p  0.42. similarly although we observed statistically significantly differences in both weighted p  0.01 and unweighted p  0.04 unifrac distances between tissue types the tumornormal grouping explained only a small proportion of the overall variation in the samples weighted r2  0.

adonis testing revealed statistically significant clustering of oral cavityoropharyngeal samples relative to hypopharyngeallaryngeal samples weighted p  0.001 unweighted p  0.001 but this clustering only explained a small proportion of the overall variation among samples weighted r2  0.018 unweighted r2  0.014tongue and tonsil locations table  as in segata et al.

as there are few effective systemic therapies in hnscc and toxicity of local treatment is often significant due to the vital structures involved identification of a microbial pathway to disease may offer new insights into targeted therapies and primary prevention.prior work investigating the microbiome of head and neck cancer including the largest cohort that was previ- ously reported by our group provided descriptive evidence of the invironment of the head and neck at higher-order taxa and suggested that microbial variation correlates with clinical outcomes and gene methylation status smaller studies that have used superficial sampling of oral cavity cancers by means of oral swabs observed differences in taxonomic abundance between normal and tumor surfaces primarily at the phylum level however bacteria in the head and neck are clearly not limited to the mucosal surface but in fact populate deep tissue 1. these findings are supported by our prior pilot study as well as a recent investigation composed of 29 patients with exclu- sively laryngeal cancer that demonstrated phylum and genus-level changes in tumor relative to normal tissue  however the significance of the findings from these studies is unclear.

adonis testing revealed statistically significant clustering based on the tumornormal grouping weighted p  0.012 unweighted p  0.042 but this clustering only explained a small proportion of the overall variation among samples weighted r2  0.010 unweighted r2  0.006. in panel b each point represents a single oral cavityoropharyngeal magenta or hypopharyngeallaryngeal green sample with plus sign and ellipses magenta solid line  oral cavityoropharynx green dashed line  hypopharynx larynx representing the fitted mean and 68 confidence interval of each group respectively.

we found no significant difference in measures of alpha diver- sity between tumor h  mean 3.72 - standard error 0.78 pd  6.42 - 1.88 and normal h  3.87 - 0.74 pd  6.62- 1.96 tissue h p  0.13 pd p  0.42.to test whether overall bacterial taxa composition was different between tumor and normal tissue we used principal coordinates analysis pcoa on weighted and unweighted unifrac distances.

furthermore the microbiome content of cancer- ous mucosal tissue compared to adjacent histologically normal tissue has not been examined outside of the setting of laryngeal cancer.with increasing evidence that a rich community of bacteria exists within head and neck tissues and may contribute to carcinogenesis we now seek to identify microbiomic differences between tumor and histologi- cally normal tissue in a large cohort of patients with hnscc of the oral cavity oropharynx hypopharynx and larynx.

these data imply that more similarities than differences exist between the overall oral microbiomes of tumor and adjacent normal tissues from the same patient consistent with what has been described previously in a smaller series despite similarities on the community level we ob- served differences between matched pairs of tumor and normal samples on the individual taxon level.

01 unweighted r2  0.01.notably however when comparing the relative abundances of individual taxa between matched pairs of tumor and normal tissue we observed that actinomyces and its parent taxa up to the phylum level were significantly depleted in tumor relative to normal tissue q  0.01 while parvimonas was increased in tumor relative to normal tissue q  0.01. these differences were more pronounced among patients with more extensive disease as measured by higher t-stage.conclusions matched pairs analysis of individual tumor-normal pairs revealed significant differences in relative abundance of specific taxa namely in the genus actinomyces.

phyla falling under 0.1 relative abundance in our dataset were not included in this analysis.hnscc tumor and paired-normal tissue are not significantly different on measures of alpha or beta diversitythe average number of reads for the 242 patient sam- ples in the final analysis was 83 - 11 and did not differ between tumor 84 - 13 and normal 83 - 7 samples p  0.48. the average read length was 745 - 117. to determine whether overall mean diversity was different in tumor and adjacent normal tissue of hnscc patients wecompared two measures of alpha diversity shannon indexh which measures the evenness and richness of a popu- lation and phylogenetic diversity pd which takes the phylogenetic relationship between taxa into account.
