These patients were not significantly different on any demographic or clinical factors when compared to the 38 patients excluded based on low read count Table The taxonomic composition of our HNSCC samples is similar to that identified in our previous pilot study of HNSCC as well as with data from previously pub- lished studies on the human oral microbiome - Firmicutes is the predominant phylum followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria then by Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria in both tumor and adjacent normal samples from HNSCC patients as well as in prior studies Fig.

However when analyzing oral cavityoropharynx samples alone Actinobacteria and Actinomyces approached signifi- cance in low-stage patients relative to high-stage patients p  0.100 p  0.192 and Parvimonas remained signifi- cantly relatively decreased among low-stage patients com- pared to high-stage patients p  0.006.

Furthermore the microbiome content of cancer- ous mucosal tissue compared to adjacent histologically normal tissue has not been examined outside of the setting of laryngeal cancer.With increasing evidence that a rich community of bacteria exists within head and neck tissues and may contribute to carcinogenesis we now seek to identify microbiomic differences between tumor and histologi- cally normal tissue in a large cohort of patients with HNSCC of the oral cavity oropharynx hypopharynx and larynx.

This study aims to identify microbiomic differences in paired tumor and non-tumor tissue samples in a large group of 121 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and correlate these differences with clinical-pathologic features.Methods Total DNA was extracted from paired normal and tumor resection specimens from 169 patients 242 samples from 121 patients were included in the final analysis.

01 unweighted R2  0.01.Notably however when comparing the relative abundances of individual taxa between matched pairs of tumor and normal tissue we observed that Actinomyces and its parent taxa up to the phylum level were significantly depleted in tumor relative to normal tissue q  0.01 while Parvimonas was increased in tumor relative to normal tissue q  0.01.

These data imply that more similarities than differences exist between the overall oral microbiomes of tumor and adjacent normal tissues from the same patient consistent with what has been described previously in a smaller series Despite similarities on the community level we ob- served differences between matched pairs of tumor and normal samples on the individual taxon level.

As there are few effective systemic therapies in HNSCC and toxicity of local treatment is often significant due to the vital structures involved identification of a microbial pathway to disease may offer new insights into targeted therapies and primary prevention.Prior work investigating the microbiome of head and neck cancer including the largest cohort that was previ- ously reported by our group provided descriptive evidence of the invironment of the head and neck at higher-order taxa and suggested that microbial variation correlates with clinical outcomes and gene methylation status Smaller studies that have used superficial sampling of oral cavity cancers by means of oral swabs observed differences in taxonomic abundance between normal and tumor surfaces primarily at the phylum level However bacteria in the head and neck are clearly not limited to the mucosal surface but in fact populate deep tissue 1.

When analyzing hypopharyngeallaryngeal samples alone Actinobacteria remained significantly relatively increased in low-stage patients p  0.031 while Actinomyces and Parvimonas were not significantly different between low-stage and high-stage groups p  0.645 p  0.790.DiscussionIn this study we sought to describe the oral microbiome of individuals with HNSCC and to compare the local microbiome of their tumors with neighboring normal tissue.
