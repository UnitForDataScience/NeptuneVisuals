1 were deter- mined by 16S rDNA sequencing for n 5 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1-- mice and n 3 'T-bet-independent' Rag1-- mice from reference 29 before 'Healthy' and after 'Colitis' transfer of WT Th cells 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1-- day 40 'T-bet-independent' Rag1-- day 12-15.

Here we show that the recipient's intestinal microbiota determines whether T-bet-deficient Th cells can induce colitis.Results and discussionRecipient hygiene status determines colitis-inducing potential of T-bet-deficient Th cellsWhen transferring CD4CD45RBhiCD25- Th cells into Rag1-- recipients derived from the Jackson Laboratory USA and bred at a Charles River facility Sulzfeld Germany WT but not T-bet-deficient Th cells induced colitis Fig.

CD4CD45RBhiCD25- WT or Tbx21-- CD4 T cells were transferred into Rag1-- recipients directly from Charles River 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1-- or after colonization with fecal microbiota from the DRFZ animal colony 'T-bet-independent' Rag1--.

5.In 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1-- mice the frequency of T-bet- deficient ROR-gt-expressing Th cells was strongly increased com- pared with WT but remained below the frequency of ROR-gtT-bet-deficient Th cells in 'T-bet-independent' Rag1-- recipients Fig.

1G H. 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1-- recip- ients had reduced frequencies of IFN-gIL-17A double-positive T-bet-deficient Th cells when compared with 'T-bet-independent' Rag1-- recipients Fig.

When instead Rag1-- recipients were transplanted with fecal microbiota from the DRFZ Berlin animalfacility prior to T cell transfer T-bet-deficient Th cells induced colitis comparable to WT Th cells Fig.

In 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1-- recipients absolute numbers of T-bet-deficient Th cells were 8-times lower compared with WT Th cells Fig.

These observations contrast the results obtained with 'T-bet-independent' Rag1-- recipients in which absolute numbers of T-bet-deficient Th cells reached approxi- mately 50 of the WT level and Ki-67 expression was similar between WT and T-bet-deficient Th cells Fig.

In 'T-bet-dependent' Rag1--recipients T-bet-deficient Th cells induced colitis with strongly reduced numbers of monocytes macrophages and neutrophils but similar numbers of eosinophils compared with WT Th cells Supporting Information Fig.

However whether SFBdetermine susceptibility to colitis induced by T-bet-deficient Th cells remains elusive and seems unlikely given our previous obser- vations of a protective function of IL-17 in colitis induced by both WT and T-bet-deficient Th cells 5.Based on the significant differences in microbiota composi- tion between 'T-bet-dependent' and 'T-bet-independent' Rag1-- recipients we analyzed possible functional differences of the two microbiomes using PICRUSt phylogenetic investigation of com-munities by reconstruction of unobserved states 16.
