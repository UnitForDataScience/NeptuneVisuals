Established risk factors forpancreatic cancer include older age male gender  cigarette smoking   long-term diabetes   and high body mass index BMI   while respiratory allergies have been consistently linked to lower risk -.A small number of prospective studies - have shown significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with poor oral health measured by tooth loss the presence of periodontal disease or antibodies to Por- phyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53978.

We also compared the mean relative proportions of individual taxa between cases and controls and between cases with PDAC and those with IPMNs using t-tests considering those taxa for which the mean relative proportion among all respondents was C 1 and excluding those that were unclassified this resulted in a total of 68 taxa Supplemental Table.

While these studies present mostly consistent evidence of associations with pancreatic cancer it is not clear which particular aspects of oral health are important for risk.In our exploratory analysis of associations between respondent characteristics risk factors and measures of oral health and measures of diversity and mean relative pro- portions of individual taxa we found few differences over- all.

In Table  comparing individual taxa between PDAC cases and IPMNs we observed that for Firmicutes and related taxa the mean relative proportions among the IPMNs were lower than that among the PDAC cases and generally similar to that in the controls.

We observed some differences in the mean relative proportions of specific taxa with PDAC cases having higher levels of Firmicutes and related taxa and controls having higher levels of Proteobacteria and related taxa.

Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate differences between these groups in demographics and risk factors.Because few reports are available on factors that might be related to the characteristics of the oral microbiota we investigated whether participant characteristics risk factors for PDAC and oral health measures were related to dif- ferences in the diversity or composition of the oralmicrobiota focusing on the seventeen taxa that were found to be different between PDAC cases and controls.
