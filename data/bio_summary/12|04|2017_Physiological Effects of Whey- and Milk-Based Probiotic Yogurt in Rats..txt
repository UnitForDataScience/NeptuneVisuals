The survival of the probiotic strains was tested in their original condition and subsequently after mixing them into a yogurt product.Pasteurized raw material milk or a 5050 mix- ture of milk and whey was inoculated with the yogurt culture 0.3 and the propionic strain.

In addition to the also important Bacteroidetes usually making up about 10-50 of the flora and Firmicutes strains accountingTable IIIComposition of the small intestinal and caecal microbiota log10 CFU1g pH dry matter and VFA content of the caecal chyme means -SDn 8group 1 CFU  colony forming unit a b c significant difference between groups P 0.05for as much as 75 Bifidobacterium strains consti- tute about 10 of the large intestinal microflora.

bulgaricus and S. thermophilus strains survived the conditions of simulated digestion in very low numbers only 101 CFUml.In the yogurt the initial germ count of probiotic strains was 108-109 during the digestion the germ counts decreased by 2-6 logs.Selection and testing of the appropriate probiotic strains require extreme circumspection.

The general condition of the intestinal mucosa the epithelial layer covering the intestinal villi the structure of the stratum villosum quantitative and qualitative composition of the cells were evaluated.

The length of the intestinal villi and the depth of the intestinal glands crypts were measured by a histometric method using an ocular micrometer.The effect of treatment or treatment and age was determined by one-way and multi-factor analysis of variance respectively SPSS 10.0 2002.

The rats drank about 3 - 8 ml of yogurt each which represented an average daily yogurt intake of 2 dl for a human of average body weight 60 kg.

In the in vivo experiment the effects of feeding a whey- and milk-based yogurt prepared with the probiotic strain showing adequate survival in the in vitro experiment was measured on body weight feed con- sumption and immune response of rats IgG and IgA level after immunisation on the composition and volatile fatty acid production of the intestinal microbiota and on the structure of intestinal villi.

2016 studied the effect of a whey protein concentrate WPC on intestinal integrity and found a greater intestinal VH and in association with the for- mer a better intestinal barrier function.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the TAMOP 4.2.2.A- 111KONV-2012-0039 project and the Bolyai Janos research grant of the HAS BO-499-13 to J.

Survival may be different under in vitro and in vivo conditions as in the living organism the survival of bacteria is influenced also by factors as the interaction between the probiotic strains and the natural intestinal microbiota the antimicrobial substances produced by microbes the motility of the intestine and the local immune response Holzapfel and Schillinger 2002.As the results suggested that probiotic lactobacilli were not present in the small and large intestine in sufficient numbers to exert such effects the physiologi- cal effects found in the experiment can be attributed to bifidobacteria.Body weight diet and yogurt drink consumption.

This has been demonstrated also by our experi- ment as the probiotic strains mixed in yogurt survived in vitro digestion in germ counts of 103-106 whereas their survival in their original condition was minimal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be cultured only in germ counts as low as 10 to 1000.Probiotic microbial strains used in combination may exert their beneficial effect more effectively than a single strain used alone Timmerman et al.
