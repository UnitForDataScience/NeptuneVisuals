It may be that the differences in adiponectin in dogs compared with people and cats contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus being less common in dogs.Many studies of insulin sensitivity in obese dogs have used the 'obese dog model' in which research dogs gain weight due to a high fat diet often including saturated fats such as lard .

Owners of overweight or obese dogs have a lower net income than owners of normal weight dogs and are less likely to participate in regular exercise  .Owner's age was associated positively with increased risk for pet overweight and obesity .

Secondary diabetes which is carbohydrate intolerance secondary to con- current insulin antagonistic disease or medications is recognized in the dog this includes dioestrus or pregnant bitches with diabetes due to progesterone- related insulin resistance.As diabetes in dogs is generally due to a lack of insulin-producing pancreatic b cells obesity does not cause diabetes mellitus however obesity does decrease insulin sensitivity in dogs and can therefore affect diabetic control .Diabetes Mellitus in CatsType 2 diabetes is estimated to be present in 80 of cats with diabetes.

Similarly low adiponectin is associated with progression to type 2 diabetes in obese people.In contrast in a study of dogs serum adiponectin concentrations were not found to be associated with insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels are not al- ways associated as directly with body fat in dogs as in people and cats .

This study identified an increased and dose-dependent risk for bladder cancer in dogs living in households where lawn chemicals were used and a higher risk in obese dogs with such exposures potentially linked to the fat solubility of these chemical exposures.

It is reasonable to ask how routinely body condition scoring a surrogate measure of obesity status is retrievable from a retro- spective medical record review.The Value of Prospective Studies in the DogBased on the insights and results taken from retro- spective risk association studies the fully overlapping hallmarks of cancer in the dog and man and the shared environmental and lifestyle exposures for dogs and people it is reasonable and likely that pro- spective studies of such environmental and lifestyle 'exposures' on cancer risk in dogs will be highly infor- mative.

These values include the compressed progression rates ofcancer in dogs compared with people and the oppor- tunity to collect biological specimens prospectively from dogs for the validation of biomarkers of expo- sure and the pharmacodynamics of markers of expo- sure or response to an intervention e.g.

Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 dia- betes mellitus in people and in cats but this association is not recognized in dogs.

These techniques have led to the development of a feline body mass index BMI  however variation between canine breeds has made the development of a similar system for dogs problematic .
