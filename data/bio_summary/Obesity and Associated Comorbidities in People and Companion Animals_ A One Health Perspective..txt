nonetheless the shared environment and lifestyle of pet animals and their hu- man families has provided a strong rationale to examine lifestyle and environmental exposures as risk factors for cancer.an example of such a risk association study includes a 1989 investigation of insecticide exposure obesity and the risk of bladder disease in dogs.

launched by the morris animal foundation the proposed cohort includes golden retriever dogs which are recognized for their high risk of cancer  .how stakeholders can affect risk factors for obesityover the past several decades numerous expert bodies have made recommendations related to popu- lation or public health strategies for human obesity prevention by altering risk factors  .

genetic risk for the disease manifests in higher risk for particular canine e.g.

the evidence review con- ducted for the latest us 2015e2020 dietary guide- lines found that there was moderate evidence that diet patterns that are 'higher in vegetables fruits and whole grains include seafood and legumes are moderate in dairy products particularly low and non-fat dairy and alcohol lower in meats including red and processed meats and low in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and refined grains are associ- ated with favourable outcomes related to healthy body weight or risk of obesity'  .another modifiable risk factor for weight gain is insufficient energy expenditure due to physical inac- tivity  .

obesity is the leading risk factor for type 2 diabetes but also increases the risk for devel- oping type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes  .obesity also increases morbidities associated with both types of diabetes.the strong links between obesity and diabetes begin during the early stages of human development.

notably it was only individuals with obesity who experienced losses in diabetes-free life ex- pectancy during this period estimated at 5.6 years for men and 2.5 years for women highlighting the relevance of obesity as a risk factor with clear and serious health consequences at the population level .obesity-associated comorbidities cancernumerous biological mechanisms have been pro- posed that may link obesity with a higher risk of various types of cancer.

inadequate evidence existed for all other sites .cancer risk association studies in veterinary medicinealthough it is clear that alterations in cancer cells are conserved and similar across species the relationship between obesity and cancer risk or progression has not been shown to be as strong in veterinary patients most often dogs.

this study identified an increased and dose-dependent risk for bladder cancer in dogs living in households where lawn chemicals were used and a higher risk in obese dogs with such exposures potentially linked to the fat solubility of these chemical exposures.

similar concerns with bladder cancer risk and lawn chemical exposure have been made in human populations.in a similar cancer association study the risk of canine lymphoma was increased in dogs living in homes with proximity to high-power electrical corri- dors .

it is reasonable to ask how routinely body condition scoring a surrogate measure of obesity status is retrievable from a retro- spective medical record review.the value of prospective studies in the dogbased on the insights and results taken from retro- spective risk association studies the fully overlapping hallmarks of cancer in the dog and man and the shared environmental and lifestyle exposures for dogs and people it is reasonable and likely that pro- spective studies of such environmental and lifestyle 'exposures' on cancer risk in dogs will be highly infor- mative.

obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 dia- betes mellitus in people and in cats but this association is not recognized in dogs.

obesity is a recognized risk factor for a number of human cancers but there are fewer data available describing this association with canine neoplastic disease.

comparative clinical research examining shared lifestyle and environmental risk factors and the reasons under- lying species differences should provide new perspectives on the fundamental biology of obesity.

what opportunities exist to leverage this intimate relationship to mitigate shared risk and to improve the health status of people and companion animals 'one health' provides a compelling framework to create understanding and to formulate solutions  .

in 2011e2014 one-sixth of american children and ado- lescents aged 2e19 years 17.0 had obesity.risk factors for obesityrisk factors in small companion animalsdogs and cats share some but not all risk factors for overweight and obesity.
