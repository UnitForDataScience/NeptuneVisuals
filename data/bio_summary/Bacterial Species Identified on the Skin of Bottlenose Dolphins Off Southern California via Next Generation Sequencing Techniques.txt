Because the prevalence of skin lesions on cetaceans appears to be on the increase   the role of bacteria and their contribution to health maintenance have become of increasing research interest.Long-term studies on common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus have identified a variety of causes lead- ing to skin lesions including potentially infectious pathogens e.g.

Terrestrial effluent carrying large volumes of cold fresh water to coastal systems has the ability to impact and shift dolphin the microbial community structure and ren- ders dolphin skin more susceptible to skin lesions and the potential for microbial penetration leading to disease .

Although the skin of the bottlenose dolphin provides adequate defense against most disease-causing microbes it also provides an environment for microbial community development.

Microbial community uniqueness and richness associated with bottlenose dolphin skin is a function of varying habitats and changing environmental con- ditions.

The current study uses ribosomal DNA as a marker to identify bacteria found on the skin of coastal and offshore bottlenose dolphins off of Southern California.

The unique microbial communities recovered from these dolphins suggest a greater microbial diversity on the skin of offshore ecotype bottlenose dolphins while microbial populations associated with the coastal ecotype include species that are more closely related to each other and that suggest exposure to communities that are likely to be associated with terrestrial runoff.Keywords Microbiome .

The skin of cetaceans is the first line of defense against environ- mental pathogens.

The thick smooth skin of these animals acts as a barrier to bacterial attachment and penetration .

Marine mammal bacterial dermatitis is considered rare and skin diseases are typically regarded as opportunistic infections to viral parasitic or traumatic insults  .

As secondary infections bacterial-related skin infections have traditionally served as indicators of individual mental immune system impairment etc.
