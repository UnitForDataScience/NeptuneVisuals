Certain risk allele genotypes have been associated with efficacy of EEN in pediatric Crohn's disease and further characterization of genetic risk in VEO-IBD may help guide the use of EEN in this population .EEN as a treatment option in VEO-IBD also improves the nutritional status of our patients.

However no studies have yet addressed the role of EEN in VEO-IBD population .The North American Society of Gastroenterology NASPGHAN recommends EEN as a primary therapy for children with inflammatory Crohn's disease .

We describe two cases in which infants presenting with VEO-IBD achieved clinical remission using exclusive enteral nutrition a formula-based diet which has been shown to induce remission in older children with active Crohn's disease.Keywords Crohn's disease  Pediatric  Inflammatory bowel disease  Exclusive enteral nutrition  Nutrition Talya L. Miller 1 Department of Pediatrics Seattle Children's Hospital and University of Washington 4800 Sandpoint Way NE Seattle WA 98105 USAIntroductionInflammatory bowel disease IBD is a chronic inflamma- tory disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by a dys- regulated immune response to the fecal microbiota.

This may be amplified in the very young VEO-IBD population during the critical time of food introduction.A multicenter prospective observational study evaluated the clinical presentation and therapeutic management of VEO-IBD and identified an increased administration of corticosteroid and immunomodulators in VEO-IBD patients compared to patients with similar disease activity in other age groups .

In older pediatric populations EEN has been shown to induce remission in approximately 85 of newly diagnosed Crohn's patients and has the equivalent response to corticosteroids in chil- dren with Crohn's disease .

The continued elevation in sedi- mentation rate was felt to be related to ongoing anemia associated with Diamond-Blackfan Table .DiscussionAlthough similar medication therapies are used in VEO- IBD as well as conventional IBD these cases illustrate the positive impact on EEN in VEO-IBD.

This study supports the need for safe and effective therapeutic options such as EEN for the VEO-IBD population.

While the nutritional benefits of EEN have been well studied in older children with IBD it is equally or more important in the VEO-IBD population .

Given the small population of VEO-IBD and young age of presentation it2200Dig Dis Sci 2017 622196-2200would be ideal to create protocols and study the role of EEN as primary or adjunctive therapy in this patient population.ReferencesUhlig HH.
