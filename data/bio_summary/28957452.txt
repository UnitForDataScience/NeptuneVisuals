Each antibiotic caused intestinal dysbiosis and characteristically influenced the regeneration of intestinal epithelial cells formation of the intestinal mucus layer and tight junctions and differentiation of splenic Foxp3 Treg cells of the neonatal mice before any clinical side effects were observed.

The potent ability of each antibiotic to affect the makeup of intestinal commensal microbiota may be a key determinant of the spectrum of antibiotics and influence the health of the host animal atleast partly.Keywords dysbiosis intestinal development immune system ceftriaxone vancomycin neonatal miceINTRODUCTIONIt is well known that the intestinal tract is the primary site of digestion and absorption in the human body it also servesas the largest immune tissue Mason et al.

However few stud- ies have investigated the mechanism underlying how various antibiotics influence early intestinal development and immune system function or have compared the changes to the intesti- nal microbiota in response to various antibiotics Ianiro Tilg and Gasbarrini .Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the effects of vancomycin- or ceftriaxone-induced intestinal dysbiosis on the development of the intestinal tract and immune system in neonatal BALBC mice by means of cellular and molecular bio- logical and histopathological techniques.MATERIALS AND METHODSMiceIn total six pregnant BALBC mice at gestational day 13 were purchased from the Institute of Laboratory Animals of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences  Sichuan Provincial People's Hos- pital Sichuan P. R. China and housed in a specific pathogen- free facility in individually ventilated plastic cages at an ambi- ent temperature of 23 - 1C and humidity of 50-70 under a 12-h lightdark cycle with free access to water and food.

The diversity and abundance of the intestinal bacteria morphological changes and barrier function of intestinal tract and the splenic CD4CD25Foxp3 T cells were investigated.

Distinct from other tissues and organs the intestinal tract also contains the body's largest microbial community the intestinal microbiota which comprises a 10-fold greater number of cells than the totalReceived 22 April 2017 Accepted 21 August 2017QC FEMS 2017.

It is a general belief that the intestinal tract is sterile in the uterus and bacteria began to colonize the intestinal tract immediately after birth.

Many studies have shown that the intestinal flora plays a cru- cial role in driving the key aspects of postnatal intestinal devel- opment mainly by polysaccharide degradation Bry et al.

The intestinal tissue injury was described and the depths of at least 300 villi or crypts in the intestinal segments includ- ing the duodenum jejunum ileum and colon were measured for each mouse with no less than 50 fields.Immunohistochemical analysisParaffin-embedded slides were cut into 1 mm widths deparaf- finized in xylene and rehydrated with graded ethanol.

d.Histopathological analysis of intestinal tissue injuryAs indicated by HE staining of the intestinal tissues villi of ileum and crypts of colon of the control group were neat and compact while those of the antibiotic treatment groups were loose and messy with some that were necrotized and detached Fig.
