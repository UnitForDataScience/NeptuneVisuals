During parenteral nutrition murine models have shown a shift in the micro- biome from a composition of mostly firmacutes to a population that is predominantly Gram-negative proteobacteria These findings have been con- firmed in human studies 2528 Proteobacteria produce lipopolysaccharide LPS which has been previously demonstrated to be associated with liver steatosis portal and intestinal inflammation and liver fibrosis 25After weaning from parenteral nutrition Lactobacillus has been shown to dominate the microbiota in patients with SBS 30 Lactoba- cillus overgrowth is associated with D-lactic acidosis and liver steatosis due to excessive bile acid decon- jugation 25 Using next-generation sequencing Engstrand Lilja et al.

Even years after weaning from parenteral nutrition liver steatosis and fibrosis have been documented to persist in some patients There- fore along with parenteral nutrition alterations in the intestinal function likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of IFALD.Lack of enteral intakeExperimental models have shown that lack of enteral feeding has significant metabolic and endo- crine consequences.

In a 24-week phase III placebo-controlled trial Teduglutide was found to reduce parenteral nutrition requirements in patients with SBS Most recently in a 2-year open-label extension of this trial Teduglutide was found to be well tolerated long term with continued decreases in parenteral nutrition requirements and advancements in enteral nutrition feeding 91 Further studies on this peptide in the pediatric population of small bowel resection SBR patients are therefore warranted.CONCLUSIONIFALD can be divided into three categories - early established and late.
