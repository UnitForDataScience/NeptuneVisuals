even years after weaning from parenteral nutrition liver steatosis and fibrosis have been documented to persist in some patients there- fore along with parenteral nutrition alterations in the intestinal function likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of ifald.lack of enteral intakeexperimental models have shown that lack of enteral feeding has significant metabolic and endo- crine consequences.

in a 24-week phase iii placebo-controlled trial teduglutide was found to reduce parenteral nutrition requirements in patients with sbs most recently in a 2-year open-label extension of this trial teduglutide was found to be well tolerated long term with continued decreases in parenteral nutrition requirements and advancements in enteral nutrition feeding 91 further studies on this peptide in the pediatric population of small bowel resection sbr patients are therefore warranted.conclusionifald can be divided into three categories - early established and late.
