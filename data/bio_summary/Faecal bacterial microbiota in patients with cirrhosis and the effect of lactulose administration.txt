the filtered otu table was then used for determination of bacterial composition of each sample.alpha diversity analysisotu table was rarefied using phyloseq to equalize the sampling depth of all the specimens to the one with10 nnwhere 'oc' represents the actual observed count of a particular otu in a specimen 'n' is the sum of observed counts for all otus in the particular specimen sx is the sum of 'n' across all specimens in the table and n is the total number of specimens in the table.beta diversity was assessed using principal co-ordinate analysis pcoa on weighted unifrac distance matrices generated from the normalized otu tables.comparison of gut microbiota composition between groupsabundances of various bacterial taxa at different taxo- nomic levels in patients and controls were compared using mann-whitney u test and those before and after lactulose were compared using paired t test.

this aspect may be stud- ied further in future studies using either shot-gun se- quencing of gut bacterial transcriptome or using a metabolomic analysis of fecal water or urine.conclusionin conclusion our data indicate that intestinal bacterial microbiota in patients with cirrhosis is different from that in healthy persons however whether these changes are primary or are a consequence of liver disease re- mains unclear.

for each specimen alpha diversity was es- timated using chao1 and abundance-based coverage esti- mator indices which measure the species richness and using shannon and simpson indices which measure the richness and distribution of taxa  these indices were compared between groups using the comparealphadiver- sity.py script of qiime 1.8 with bonferroni correction.beta diversity analysisthe filtered data were assembled into a table where each row represented an otu and each column represented a faecal specimen.

the merged reads were subjected to quality control using ngsqc toolkit  to exclude those with average phred quality score below 30. the selected high-quality reads were proc- essed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1.8 software package 4. any chimeric se- quences identified using usearch61 were purged.

based on align- ment of the representative otu sequences a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the fasttree tool tax- onomy was assigned to each otu using the qiime's uclust consensus taxonomy assigner against the greengenes v13.8 reference otus using the software's de- fault parameters.

putative metabolic functions of the micro- bial communities in each specimen were compared be- tween patients and controls using mann-whitney u test and those before and after lactulose were compared using wilcoxon's signed-rank test.statistical analysisclinical and laboratory variables were compared be- tween groups using chi-squared test for categorical data and unpaired t-test or mann-whitney u test for numer- ical data.

in recent years changes in gut microbiota - the so-called gut 'dys- biosis' - has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sev- eral diseases such as hepatic and gastrointestinal diseases obesity  diabetes mellitus  andhypertension we found a difference in the profile of gut microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and healthy persons as shown by differential clustering on pcoa.

several mechanisms have been proposed for the beneficial ef- fects of lactulose in he including i its laxative action which reduces the contact time between luminal con- tents and the intestinal mucosa reducing the absorption of ammonia ii creation of an acidic environment in the colonic lumen which traps ammonia by enhancing its conversion into polar and less-absorbable ammonium ions and iii change in the composition of colonic microbiota with reduced density of bacteria that pro- duce ammonia and an increased density of those that utilize ammonia for their metabolism data on the effect of lactulose on gut microbiota are quite scanty and conflicting  in previous stud- ies lactulose was shown to facilitate the growth of acido- philic urease-deficient bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon another study re- ported an increase in the number of anaerobic lactoba- cilli and a decrease in that of bacteroides spp.

second the diet of patients with cirrhosis may differ from that in healthy persons this may by itself influence the gut microbiota also alcohol consumption is known to alter gut microbiota  to obviate this we excluded persons with recent alcohol intake from our study.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.the occurrence of complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis sepsis and hepatorenal syndrome .modulation of gut microbiota using antimicrobial agents and probiotic preparations has been shown to improve he this suggests that intestinal bacteria play a role in the causation of he.

thus there is a need to study the effect of lactulose on the composition of gut microbiota using better techniques.in recent years high-throughput sequencing of gene for bacterial 16s ribosomal rna has emerged as a useful method for studying the composition of complex bacter- ial mixtures these techniques exploit the differ- ences in this gene between various bacteria such that their sequences accurately identify various bacterial groups often up to the species level.

in the current study we applied high- throughput sequencing to determine whether gut micro- biota in patients with cirrhosis differed from those of healthy controls and whether lactulose treatment leads to a change in the composition of gut microbiota in pa- tients with cirrhosis.methodssubjectspatients with cirrhosis irrespective of the cause or sever- ity of liver dysfunction measured using child-turcotte- pugh ctp class and with no co-existing disease were enrolled from the outpatient clinic of our institution be- tween october 2013 and april 2014. diagnosis of cirrho- sis was based on a combination of typical clinical biochemical endoscopic and radiological findings.

in either case benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate correction was used to account for multiple comparisons using p 0.05 as the cut-off.cirrhosis-dysbiosis ratiothis ratio a previously-described quantitative index of microbiota alterations accompanying cirrhosis progres- sion was computed as the natural log ln of the ratio of aggregated abundance of autochthonous lachnospira- ceae ruminococcaceae and veillonellaceae and non- autochthonous enterobacteriaceae and bacteroidaceae taxa .

our study using this technique failed to show any change in gut microbiota after lactuloseadministration.

using an endoscope requires prior cleansing of the gut which would disrupt the luminal microbiota per se.
