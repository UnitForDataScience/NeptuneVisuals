The bi- plot showed strong correlations in S1 samples between methane production and AP ratio and in S2 and S3 between primary VFAs and age which were negatively correlated with methane production.

The primer pairs of uniMet1-F and uniMet1-R were used to amplify the partial methanogen 16S rRNA gene   with the following amplification conditionsdenaturation at 95C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles ofdenaturation at 95C for 30 s annealing at 56C for 30 s and extension at 72C for 30 s. The primer pairs of Bac1 and Bac2 were used to amplify the partial bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the same conditions as above  .

The population of methanogens increased with age with a significant difference between the S1 and S3 groups p  0.05 but there was no significant difference in the bacteria population size or methanogenbacteria proportion  between the groupsp  0.34.Rumen Bacterial Composition across Different Age GroupsAfter sequence processing there were 108864 sequences clustered into 3504 OTUs for bacteria with an average ofTABLE 1  Feed intake performance methane production rumen fermentation parameters and microbial population sizes in cattle in different age groups.Item Means - SEP-value S1 n  6S2 n  7S3 n  7Performance and methane productionBody weight kg321.33 - 14.97a663.14 - 13.51b686.43 - 8.20b0.001DMI kgday6.37 - 0.09a16.15 - 0.09c15.25 - 0.12b0.010CH4 gdayhead191.93 - 11.44a379.02 - 8.88c313.73 - 9.95b0.001CH4 gkg DMI30.13 - 1.80b23.47 - 0.59a20.57 - 0.65a0.001CH4 g100 kg body weight60.34 - 4.34b57.33 - 1.96b45.66 - 1.06a0.002Rumen fermentationAmmonia-N mgdL28.91 - 1.95b27.94 - 1.82b21.19 - 2.24a0.029Acetate mmolL55.93 - 7.5665.69 - 10.7980.09 - 7.110.183Propionate mmolL14.31 - 1.20a19.00 - 2.25a29.47 - 3.03b0.001Butyrate mmolL8.51 - 1.74a10.38 - 2.10ab14.08 - 1.11b0.094Total VFA mmolL78.75 - 10.40a95.07 - 16.16ab123.62 - 11.17b0.054AP ratio3.95 - 0.52b3.40 - 0.22ab2.79 - 0.20a0.071Microbial population sizeTotal methanogen log copiesmL9.61 - 0.14a9.73 - 0.08ab9.92 - 0.08b0.124Total bacteria log copiesmL11.59 - 0.1111.78 - 0.0911.76 - 0.130.446Methanogenbacteria proportion 1.13 - 0.191.07 - 0.261.55 - 0.270.340Within a row different superscript letters indicate p  0.05 and means without superscript letters indicate p  0.05.

The concentration and profile of VFAs is related to methane production as confirmed in previous studies  .

The present study thus provides the first report to evaluate the effect of age on methane production and microbiota.

The production of propionate competes with methanogens for metabolic hydrogen consumption  .

The present findings provide the basis for further investigations of the effects of microbe-host interactions on digestive and metabolic activities as the physiological base of age-related effects.CONCLUSIONThe present study compared methane production among cows of different ages and observed significant age-related shifts and distributions of bacteria.

Heifers 9-10 months had lower methane production but higher methane production per dry matter intake DMI.

This shift may account for the age-related difference in rumen fermentation and methane production per DMI.Keywords enteric methane production rumen microbiota dairy cow age-related microbiota high-throughput sequencingINTRODUCTIONMethane is one of the most abundant greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere with a significant impact on global warming 28-times that of carbon dioxide  .
