cecal lacto- bacilli populations were significantly p  0.05 higher in broilers fed diets containing 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 lc when compared to that in control broilers at 21 and 42 d of age and there was no sig- nificant difference between the cecal lactobacilli populations of broilers fed 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 lc.at 21 and 42 d of age broiler chickens fed 1 g kg-1 lc showed significantly p  0.05 higher cecal bifidobacteria populations than the control.

at 42 d of age the populations of lactobacilli in broiler chickens given 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 lc were significantly p  0.05 higher than that of the control and between the two lc- supplemented groups chickens given 1 g kg-1 lc showed significantly p  0.05 higher lactobacilli population than those fed 0.5 g kg-1 lc.

broiler chickens supplemented with 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 lc had significantly p  0.05 lower populations of e. coli than those of control broilers at 21 and 42 d of age and the cecal e. coli populations between broilers fed 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 lc were not significantly different at both ages.serum lipids and relative weights of organsthe results of serum lipid analysis of broilers fed the three dietary treatments at 21 and 42 d of age are shown in .

birds fed dietary treatments supplemented with 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 lc had significantly p  0.01 lower populations of total cecal aerobes than the control at 21and 42 d of age.between the two supplemented groups birds fed 0.5 g kg-1 lc had significantly p  0.01 higher population of total cecal aerobes than those fed 1 g kg-1 lc at both ages.

mortality was observed in the control and broilers supplemented with 0.5 g kg-1 lc one chicken for each treatment group during 42 days of experiment but there was no mortality in broilers fed 1 g kg-1 lc.

however at both ages the cecal bifi- dobacteria populations of broilers supplemented with 0.5 g kg-1 lc were not significantly dif- ferent from that of control or broilers fed 1 g kg-1 lc.
