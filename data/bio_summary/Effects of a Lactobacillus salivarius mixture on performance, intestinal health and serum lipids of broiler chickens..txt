However at 42 d of age chickens fed 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC showed significantly P  0.01 higher body weights 2164.3 and 2274.5 g respectively than control chickens 2017.3 g.From 1 to 21 d of age body weight gains of broiler chickens were not significantly different among the dietary treatments but from 22 to 42 and 1 to 42 d of age broilers given 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC had significantly P  0.01 higher body weight gains than control chickens.

Cecal lacto- bacilli populations were significantly P  0.05 higher in broilers fed diets containing 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC when compared to that in control broilers at 21 and 42 d of age and there was no sig- nificant difference between the cecal lactobacilli populations of broilers fed 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC.At 21 and 42 d of age broiler chickens fed 1 g kg-1 LC showed significantly P  0.05 higher cecal bifidobacteria populations than the control.

At 42 d of age the populations of lactobacilli in broiler chickens given 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC were significantly P  0.05 higher than that of the control and between the two LC- supplemented groups chickens given 1 g kg-1 LC showed significantly P  0.05 higher lactobacilli population than those fed 0.5 g kg-1 LC.

Broiler chickens supplemented with 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC had significantly P  0.05 lower populations of E. coli than those of control broilers at 21 and 42 d of age and the cecal E. coli populations between broilers fed 0.5 or 1 g kg-1 LC were not significantly different at both ages.Serum lipids and relative weights of organsThe results of serum lipid analysis of broilers fed the three dietary treatments at 21 and 42 d of age are shown in .

At both ages the E. coli populations of broilers given 1 g kg-1 LC were significantly P  0.01 lower when compared to those fed 0.5 g kg-1 LC.Effects of dietary supplementations of a mixture of three L. salivarius strains LC on populations of cecal lactobacilli bifidobacteria total aerobes and E. coli of broiler chickens at 21 and 42 d of age enumerated using the conventional spread plate method and expressed as log10 CFU g-1.
