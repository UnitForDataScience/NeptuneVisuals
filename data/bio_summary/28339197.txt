A subset of representative colonies was selected indicated by red arrows and a virtual grid was laid over these colonies using the instrument's software to target where laser ablation would occur.

The light blue polygons show where mass data were collected from the colonies within the range of mz 200-2000.

The inset shows bacterial colonies growing on the surface of an agar plate.

The plate was placed inside the LAESIMS chamber for mass spectrometry profiling.
