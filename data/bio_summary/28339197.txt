the light blue polygons show where mass data were collected from the colonies within the range of mz 200-2000. the presented mass data were derived from the circled colony average of several locations taken from the colony and subtracted from mass data obtained from a blank uncolonized portion of the plate which reveals prominent single and doubly charged sodium adduct ions for wlip 1.c 2017 american chemical society andpublished march 24 2017american society of pharmacognosy1233doi j. nat.

a subset of representative colonies was selected indicated by red arrows and a virtual grid was laid over these colonies using the instrument's software to target where laser ablation would occur.

the inset shows bacterial colonies growing on the surface of an agar plate.

the plate was placed inside the laesims chamber for mass spectrometry profiling.
