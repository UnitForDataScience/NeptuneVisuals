Even the co-transfer of splenocytes from VSL3- treated NOD mice and diabetogenic cells derived from newly diabetic NOD mice conferred full protection to irradiated naive NOD mice compared to mice that have received splenocytes from PBS-treated mice .

The intestinal microbiome encompasses both the microbial community and its total genome  in human gut bacteria are made up of 100 times more genes respect to human genome .

Analysis of gut microbial regulation of host gene expression along the length of the gut and regulation of gut microbial ecology through MyD88.

Alterations in its composition have been correlated to changes in the gut immune system including defective tolerance to food antigens intestinal inflammation and enhanced gut permeability.

Although these data support the hypothesis that antigens present in the lumen of the intestine could come across the intestinal epithelial layer due to an altered gut permeability in genetically predisposed subjects thus inducing autoimmunity onset it has not been clarified whether the impaired gut perme- ability represents a cause or an effect of T1D development .Several genes have been identified as risk factors for T1D and they accounted for 40-50  of the disease risk.

This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the exposure of IgA-deficient GF mice to B. thetaiotamicron strongly induced Reg3c  whereas Reg3c-deficient mice showed high levels of IgA cells and a higher intestinal colonization by bacteria associated with adaptive immune response activation in the intestine .

Authors conclude that NOD mice harbor gut microbes that induce diabetes and that their diabetogenic microbiome can be amplified early in life through antibiotic exposure.

Con- versely the presence of a specific microbiome resembling that presents in the gut of humans in physiological condi- tions significantly reduced without abolishing T1D inci- dence in GF NOD.MyD88-negative mice .

The presence of microbiota is necessary to induce IEC proliferation in case of injury by activating TLRs accordingly IECs of GF mice showed a reduced proliferation rate compared to conventional mice .

not only supports the hypothesis that NOD microbiome is diabetogenic as demonstrated by the fact that the fecal transplantation of NOD microbes caused insulitis onset in NOR diabetic resistant mice but proved that antibiotic exposure promoted diabetes onset in NOD mice.
