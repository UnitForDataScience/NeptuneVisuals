Air bubbles remove bacteria from a surface when the three-phase line separating the liquid the air and the solid surface contacts the cells.The capillary action of moving air-liquid interfaces is known to cause colloidal aggrega- tionand to generate forces that tend to detach bacteria from surfaces in a broad range of environments including in the oral cavity during eating speaking drinking and swallowingin the eye and on contact lenses during blinkingand on rocks and ship hulls in aquatic systems.However previous research on biofilm detachment by air bubbles has focused on endpoint measurements to quantify the net amount of biofilm removed whereas the mode of biofilm disruption has remained unexplored.

This flow rate corresponds to an average flow velocity of 250 um s-1 and a shear rate at the bottom surface of 30 s-1.Air bubble generationTo introduce controlled air bubbless in the microchannel we used a three- way valve one inlet for the bacterial solution used for initial injection one inlet for the bacteria-free M63 medium used for 4 h 8 h or 12 h and one inlet for atmospheric air to generate air bubbles.

Although the evaporation of the thin liquid layer occurs regardless of the density of bacteria on the surface this mechanism only works at intermediate adhesion strengths 8 h-old biofilm on the hydro- phobic patch whereas for younger biofilms cells are swept away and for older biofilms the capillary force is insufficient to scrape cells across the surface.

However the results reported here add a new dimension to our understanding of biofilm disruption because they demonstrate that an environment in which a surface is initially uniformly colonized--which is different from the trail networks driven by twitching motility--can in fact hide an underlying structure that controls the effect of a mechanical insult on surface colonization.

g. Taken together these measurements indicate that a long air bubble largely removed 4 h-old biofilms primarily rearranged cells in 8 h-old biofilms without detaching them and had little effect on 12 h-old biofilms.Imaging of the hole formation dynamics at high temporal resolution 50 frames s-1 revealed that the hole pattern resulted from the rupturing of the residual thin liquid film between the channel surface and the bubble at discrete locations.

The critical role played by surface tension forces in the formation of holes is confirmed by experiments in which we used high flow rates up to 100 ul min-1 albeit for a short time and did not observe any spatial re- arrangement of the bacteria as in the case of the passage of an air bubble.

Surprisingly we found that although bacteria quickly covered the surface of each patch so that after 8 h of growth the cell distribution is nearly uniform Figs b and a the distribution of EPS remained highly heterogeneousBiofilm disruption by an air bubble H Jang et al.5A Cells beforeCells afterEPS beforeEPS afterFig.

d.The observed disruption pattern caused by air bubbles high- lights the microscale heterogeneity intrinsic in the biofilm's organization likely reflecting microscale spatial variability in EPS production andor surface colonization times.

We rationalize this finding in terms of the competition between dislodging shear forces and the spatially varying adhesion strength resulting from intrinsic heterogeneity in EPSdistribution within the biofilm.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe studied the formation and disruption of controlled Pseudo- monas aeruginosa PA01 biofilm patches on the glass bottom of a1Ralph M.
