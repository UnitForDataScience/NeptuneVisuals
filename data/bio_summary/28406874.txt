Recent literature has associated intestinal microbial composition with several chronic diseases including obesity9-12 diabetes13-17 gastrointestinal disturbances18-21 and neurological and neurogenerative disorders such as depression2223 anxiety24 and autism.2526Dietary influence on intestinal microbiotaDiet has been identified as the major contributing factor to the composition of intestinal microbiota.27 It is evident that dietary-related changes have the potential to exert health benefits through alteration of the intestinal microbial composition and could function as a viable mechanism to help prevent or mitigate diseases associated with an imbalance of intestinal microbiota also known as dysbiosis.27-29 Since dietary patterns are associated with specific combinations of bacteria in the intestine complex diets can provide parameters for growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors for specific microbiota phylotypes.30It is now known that host-microbiome interactions can synergize with one another to metabolize dietary components to produce signaling molecules that serve as communication systems within the body that bring health benefits.

Studies of animal models indicate that fat feeding and a high-fat diet increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide LPS endotoxin by 2-fold and 5-fold respectively resulting in increased insulin resistance and obesity.50Harmful intestinal microbes create a state of dysbiosis and release a microbial endotoxin called LPS that damages the integrity of the intestinal barrier creating a leaky gut better known as intestinal permeability that allows for the passage of LPS endotoxins into the bloodstream setting the stage for the cascade of systemic inflammation.5152 This intestinal barrier dysfunction is observed in the obese state and provides a porthole for entry of microbes and microbial-derived LPS endotoxin into the circulation producing a systemic inflammatory response resulting in increased insulin resistance and obesity.

A muciniphila is a gram-negative bacterium that has demonstrated a protective function by controlling fat storage adipose tissue inflammation and glucose metabolism.56 F prausnitzii is an abundant intestinal microbe that has shown protective effects in cases of low-grade chronic inflammation and in promoting intestinal barrier function.57SUMMARYThe epidemic levels of obesity and overweight conditions on a global scale have resulted in an increased risk for cardiovascular disease obesity and type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia cholelithiasis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as breast lung uterine and ovarian cancer.

Several studies have indicated a higher proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in obese phenotype than in individuals with normal weight9 and weight loss has shown to reduce the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio.10 It is interesting to note that a high-sugar high-fat diet that characterizes the Western diet increases the relative abundance of Firmicutes in preference to Bacteroidetes in animal models49 in comparison with low-caloric diet-induced weight loss that increases the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in obese individuals these findings however are not universal.27 Data corresponding to models of human intestinal ecosystems suggest that changing from a low-fat plant-based complex carbohydrate-rich diet to a high-fat high-sugar diet has the potential to shift the composition of the microbiota within a 24-hour period resulting in a swift alteration in metabolic pathways and modification in microbiome genotype.35 Research continues to reaffirm that obeseoverweight individuals who consume a healthier dietary pattern show less metabolic impairment and have the highest diversity in intestinal microbiota.38Microbiota inflammation and obesitySeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of microbiota as it relates to obesity.

Although the primary causative factor that leads to the development of obesity is a dysbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure recent research suggests that intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the control of body weight energy homeostasis and inflammation and therefore is an important consideration in the pathophysiology of obesity.
