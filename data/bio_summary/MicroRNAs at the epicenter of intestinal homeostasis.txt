Targeting some of these deregulated miRNAs may represent a novel treatment options for IBD patients.Gut microbiota and miRNAs Do gut microbes regulate host miRNA or do miRNAs control themHost-secreated miRNAs in control of gut microbiotaThe microbiota play a key role in the maintenance of gut homeostasis and so far efforts have mainly focused on identification of the factors and the mechanisms through which the microbial community contributes to disease development 64 65.

But is it also possible that gut microbiota affect gene expression in IECs at the post-transcriptional level by regulating the host miRNA profile Indeed it has been shown that the microbiota modulate host miRNA expression pattern 70 as mice colonized with SPF microbiota showed differential expression of nine miRNAs in their ileum and colon compared to GF controls.

Further insights into the role of miRNAs in differentiation of goblet cells were provided in another study where gut-specific deletion of Dicer1 Dicer1 Dgut which is essential for miRNA biogenesis resulted in reduction of Resistin-Like Molecule-beta RELMb expression in goblet cells and highly predisposed the mice to parasite infection.

This review focuses on the role of miRNAs and their gene regulatory networks in regulation of intestinal function and homeostasis.Where do miRNAs come from and what they doTo date hundreds of miRNAs have been discovered and one intriguing question concerns their biological role.

Nevertheless the data so far demonstrate the powerful effect of host-secreted miRNAs on bacterial growth and opens new and perhaps very effective means for manipulation of gut microbial communities.Gut microbiota impact the host gene expression program by inducing specific miRNAsThe ability of gut microbiota to regulate gene expression in the IECs is now well recognized although the mechanisms through which gut microbes exert this regulation are not fully understood 68.

Therefore these studies provide clues that the microbiota regulate host gene expression through modulation of the host miRNA signature.As discussed above the miRNA expression signature is altered during intestinal inflammation and an increasing body of evidence shows that regulatory networks involving miRNAs are at the root of controlling the inflammatory responses.

The biological relevance of these bacterially secreted ncRNAs remains unknown.These few examples showing the potential of gut micro- biota to regulate host gene expression through inducing changes in the miRNAs highlight that there is much more to be discovered especially in diseases associated with dysbiosis.Gut microbiota produces metabolites that affect miRNA expressionAs mentioned above it is very possible that bacterial ncRNA sequences found in the membrane vesicles play roles in regulation of gene expression programs in IECs.

The involvement of several miRNAs in the pathogenesis of IBD is discussed below and summarized in Table 1.MiR-10a targets the expression of IL12IL-23p40 in dendritic cells.

Microbial signals thatactivate TLR ligands and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate expression of several other miRNAs such as miR-146 miR-132 miR-9 and miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells 9 48 49.
