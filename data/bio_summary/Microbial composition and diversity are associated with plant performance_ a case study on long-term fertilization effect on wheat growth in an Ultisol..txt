However because of the inherent poor properties of Ultisol such as low pH low cation exchange capacity and deficiencies of phosphorus potassium calcium and magne- sium rational fertilization and management of soil fertility are the most important measures to improve grain yield toward a sustainable crop production Zhang et al.

Furthermore because of the difficulty in accurately predicting fertilizer re- quirements rates exceeding plant requirements are often ap- plied thus inducing unintended environmental consequences Ju et al.

Moreover fertilization changed the abun- dance and composition of soil functional microorganisms He et al.

Shen et al.

This has become a major concern for scientists environmental groups and agricultural policymakers worldwide.Recently there has been growing interest in the role of plant growth primarily mediated by microbial communities in soil Friesen et al.

Soilmicroorganisms are regarded as important agents of plant-soil system Lou et al.

First there exists nutrient competi- tion between plants and microorganisms when coexisting in a low-resource environment Hodge et al.

For example plant and microbial uptake of NH  may reduce the quantity of substrate available for nitrification and thereby lessen the potential for NO - loss via denitrification and leaching Zak et al.

Soil-borne pathogenic bacteria and fungi can impede plant growth or survival by producing toxins or occupying the nutrients' mining space at the root tips of plants Blom et al.
