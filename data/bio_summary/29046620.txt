Alternatively the salicylates in the historic calculus samples may be a plant root-derived product Badri and Vivanco  resulting from the dif- fusion highly soluble small organic acids into the calculus from burial soil.In contrast to the large number of sub-pathways represent- ing a significantly higher proportion of metabolites between historic and modern calculus only 22 individual metabolites were significantly differentially represented between historic and modern calculus Fig.

More than half of the metabolites n  185 were detected in both historic and modern calculus sam- ples demonstrating that metabolites can be recovered from historic dental calculus while 99 metabolites were detected only in modern samples and one was detected only in his- toric samples.

A subset of five historic dental calculus samples CS6 CS12 CS18 CS24 and CS46 were additionally analyzed at the Departments of Chemistry and Biomolecular Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin Madison USA to further characterize metabolites and lipids by high-resolution gas chromatography GC-MS and UPLC-MSMS Table .Table 1 Summary of sampleIDAgeaSexb SmokerOral healthSampled toothAnalyses performeddemographic and health information and analyses performedModernPD periodontal disease GV gingivitis NA not available  present - absentaAge of skeletons used for historical calculus sampling is based on osteological indicators and is a range estimatebHistorical skeleton sex estimate is based on both osteological indicators and DNA sequencing and was in concurrence between the two methodscUPLC-MSMS was performed twice the first at Metabolon Inc. and the second at the University of Wis- conson-MadisonGenetic authentication of a preserved oral microbiome in historic samplesDNA extracted from a separate fragment of each piece of historic calculus was used to assess microbial community composition.

2.6.Further characterization of historic calculus by GC-MS and UPLC-MSMSFive historic dental calculus samples were selected to further investigate metabolites and lipids in historic dental calculus samples Table .

b Historic calculus samples cluster based on biological category sex age caries status and periodontal disease status when including all metabolites detected in at least one historic sample.Ellipses indicate 95 confidence intervalsDiscussionOur results derived from the non-targeted assessment of metabolites present in dental calculus from both modern and historic samples demonstrate the significant potential of calculus as a material for metabolomics and lipidomic studies.

PLS-DA separated historic samples based on sex age caries status and periodontal disease status when using metabolites detected in at least one historic sample Fig.

This concern may be addressed in future experiments by looking at preservation of small organic acids in historic calculus samples from individuals who were never buried in soil such as from crypt burials and from archaeological samples that have been in storage for varying periods of time.Lipids particularly unmodified saturated classes are some of the best-preserved metabolites in historic calculus and appear to be particularly stable over time.

have been used to infer the use of dietary andor medicinal plants however to our knowledge no broad-scale analysis to determine the potential range of metabolites trapped in dental calculus has been undertaken.Here we present an in-depth metabolic analysis of aset of historic and modern dental calculus samples using a combination of targeted and untargeted approaches to assess the range of metabolites that can be extracted from calculus and how well they persist and preserve over time.

first including metabolites detected in both historic and mod- ern samples and then again using only those metabolites that were universally detected in all 17 calculus samples.
