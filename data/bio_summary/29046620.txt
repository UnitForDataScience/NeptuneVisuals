alternatively the salicylates in the historic calculus samples may be a plant root-derived product badri and vivanco  resulting from the dif- fusion highly soluble small organic acids into the calculus from burial soil.in contrast to the large number of sub-pathways represent- ing a significantly higher proportion of metabolites between historic and modern calculus only 22 individual metabolites were significantly differentially represented between historic and modern calculus fig.

more than half of the metabolites n  185 were detected in both historic and modern calculus sam- ples demonstrating that metabolites can be recovered from historic dental calculus while 99 metabolites were detected only in modern samples and one was detected only in his- toric samples.

these results suggest that biological categories in modern and historic calculus samples cannot be directly compared yet patterns of biological differences are maintained through time.similarly no metabolites could be specifically attrib-uted to bacterial processes but several metabolites including isovalerate valerate lactate cadaverine and putrescene are known metabolic products of oral bac- teria scully et al.

historic and modern samples still separate distinctly in pca figure s6a but many more metabolites have a significant difference in mean proportions figure s6b.we then examined differences in proportion of super-pathways sub-pathways and individual metabolites present in at least one modern and historic sample to better under- stand the patterns of preservation and loss through time.

follow- ing this analysis differential representation of metabolites between historic and modern samples was determined using the program statistical analysis of metagenomic profilesstamp parks and beiko  parks et al.

this concern may be addressed in future experiments by looking at preservation of small organic acids in historic calculus samples from individuals who were never buried in soil such as from crypt burials and from archaeological samples that have been in storage for varying periods of time.lipids particularly unmodified saturated classes are some of the best-preserved metabolites in historic calculus and appear to be particularly stable over time.

have been used to infer the use of dietary andor medicinal plants however to our knowledge no broad-scale analysis to determine the potential range of metabolites trapped in dental calculus has been undertaken.here we present an in-depth metabolic analysis of aset of historic and modern dental calculus samples using a combination of targeted and untargeted approaches to assess the range of metabolites that can be extracted from calculus and how well they persist and preserve over time.

here ubiquity among the five modern samples was applied as a measure to identify highly prevalent potentially core dental calculus metabolites complete absence of these metabolites among all twelve historic samples was used to identify metabolite candidates that may be particularly prone to loss or that are unstable and susceptible to degradation through time-dependent taphonomic processes.

first including metabolites detected in both historic and mod- ern samples and then again using only those metabolites that were universally detected in all 17 calculus samples.
