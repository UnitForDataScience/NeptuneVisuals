The absence of bacteria had no obvious influence on HDM pathology.Asthma influences lung microbiota during the neonatal periodWe tested whether HDM-induced asthma influences the viable bacteria amount in the lung.

The contribution of lung bacterial strains to the establishment of asthma or their participation in chronic inflammation has never been addressed by using HDM challenge.
