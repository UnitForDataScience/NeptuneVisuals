thus inoculation with cncm i 4969 protected mice from hdm-induced airway disease.we obtained an intermediate profile when we co- administered cncm i 4969 and cncm i 4970. the mice were not protected against the growth delay a hdm vs cncm i 49694970hdm  ns.serum ige and bal il-5 levels were similar b but bal cellularity was reduced 10.39 - 0.45 x 105 in hdm vs 7.32 - 0.75 x 105 incncm i 49694970hdm po0.01 as well as the percentage of bal eosinophils b po0.05.il-5 levels were reduced in rln supernatants after in vitro hdm re-stimulation  po0.01 reflecting reduced type 2 immune priming.

the basal level of ige was increased by both strains in the absence of hdm pbs vs cncm i 4970 and pbs vs cncm i 4969 po0.01.the treatment with hdm led to a higher amount of serum ige hdm vs pbs po0.05 and this hdm-induced ige was worsened by cncm i 4970hdm  hdm vs cncm i 4970hdmpo0.01.

hdm efficiently induced allergic asthma with an equivalent magnitude of t2immunity and inflammatory response in gf and spf mice despite higher variability of ige levels in gf sera.we observed that some innate genes showed different patterns of expression at steady statebetween gf and spf mice the level of tslp mrna was higher in gf mice whereas il-10 ifng ccl11 and muc5ac mrna levels were higher in spf mice supplementary figure s1 po0.05 for il-10 po0.01 for all other genes.

the secretion of il-5 tends to be higher in cncm i 4970-stimulated cells compared with non- stimulated cells but does not reach significant level p  0.0625. altogether cncm i 4969 induced atype 1 cytokine profile whereas cncm i 4970 a member of the staphylococcus genus whose levels were higher after hdm treatment induces secretion of the majority of cytokines tested tslp il-10 il-17a and il-12p70.we next investigated whether these two immuno- modulatory bacteria isolated from the neonatal lung microbiota could affect the severity of hdm- triggered asthma in spf mice.

this was not the case for cncm i 4969.the administration of cncm i 4969 or cncm i 4970 in spf mice did not change the frequency of lung dc and t cells observed after hdm challenge data not shown one experiment.

selected strains were deposited at the french national collection of microorganism cultures cncm under the name cncm i 4969 and cncm i 4970 patented strains.animals and proceduresanimal experiments were approved by the local ethics committee under the registration number 01553.01. spf c57bl6 mice purchased from janvier le genest st isle france were bred and housed under felasa spf conditions in our animal facilities ierp inra jouy-en-josas france or vib ghent belgium.

the challenge withfigure 3 ex vivo immunomodulation profiles of cncm i 4969 and cncm i 4970. precision-cut lung slices pcls of adult gf lungs were cultivated ex vivo for 24 h in supplemented rpmi alone medium or with 50 cfu of the two strains cncm i 4969 and cncm i 4970 isolated from healthy neonatal lungs.

in rln supernatants il-5 and il-10 production was significantly lower in the cncm i 4969hdm group than in the hdm group po0.05 suggesting reduced type 2 immune priming.the lungs from hdm-treated mice showed perivas- cular immune infiltrates myofibroblast proliferation a hematoxilin eosin safran staining mucus production periodic acid schiffalcian blue staining and a thickened epithelium relative to pbs- treated mice po0.0001.

we did not observe any striking differences in lung structure airway epithelium thickness or bronchus number between gf pbs- and spf pbs-treated mice fi although the lungs of gf mice seemed to have fewer larger alveoli as previously published the total number of cells recovered from bal was greater after hdm treatment pbs vs hdm po0.05 for gf po0.01 for spf.
