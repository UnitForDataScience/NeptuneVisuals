We analyzed these data sets using an integrated framework to identify predictors of inflammatory states and then reproduced some of the putative relationships formed among these predictors by analyzing data from the pediatric RISK cohort.Results We identified 26 predictors from our combined data set that were effective in distinguishing between regions of the intestine undergoing active inflammation and regions that were normal.

We chose these parameters as this was the only setting that resulted in the validated inflammation marker1548  genes DUOX2 and APOA1 being selected as inflammation pre- dictors.13 Log2 RPKM values of inflammation gene predictors and CLR-transformed values of inflammation OTU predictors were then concatenated into a single matrix and visualized as a heatmap after biclustering.To identify gene and OTU predictors of SAA1 expression levels from the RISK cohort we used SAA1 expression levels as a response variable and fit a sparse partial least square regression model to the RNA-Seq and 16S microbial data separately.

We further separated these predictors into 2 different subgroups--predictors with high- er abundance in regions with active inflammation and predictors with higher abundance in normal regions.

To further infer the relationships between the predictors we performed pairwise correlations using Spearman correlation on the predictors.

Inter- actions between gene and OTU predictors of SAA1 levels were then inferred using pairwise Spearman correlation values between the predictors.

To independently assess the effectiveness of these predictors in distinguishing between inflammatory states we sub- jected predictors from the first component to unsupervised PCA and biclustering analysis.

With the exception of the CD4IL17IL222 and CD4IL42IL222 pop- ulations the remaining 24 predictors from component 2 were different from predictors from component 1.

Network analysis on these 26 predictors revealed SAA1 as the most connected node linking the abundance of the genus Bacteroides with the production of IL17 and IL22 by CD4 T cells.

We have also termed the selected variables from the sGCCA model as predictors of inflammatory states.
