therefore lmp1cd40-induced migration andreduction of cd103 th dcs led to loss of helios - rorgtthfoxp3 th itreg breakdown of intestinal tolerance with higher numbers of pathogenic il-17a thifn-g th th17th1 and ifn-g th th1 cd4 t cells and commensal-specific antibodies.discussionhere we report that acute and constitutive cd40-triggering of intestinal dcs induces their robust migration from lp to the mlns leading to strong reduction of cd103 thcd11b - andcd103 thcd11b th dcs.

the fact cd103 - dcs do express and can upregulate endogenous cd40 and do express the lmp1cd40-transgene suggest that cd40-signalling might be wired differently in cd103 - dcs as compared with cd103 th dcs.taken together we present a novel intrinsic model of colitis where the migration of cd103 th dcs is induced causing their numerical reduction by apoptosis in the draining mlns.

cd103 thcd11b th dcs are a major subpopulation of tolerogenic dcs which can also induce th17 cellsor th17 and th1 cells upon activation with toll-like receptor tlr-ligands.

studies revealed precise roles of the distinct dc subsets showing that cd103 thcd11b - dcs migrating from lp to draining ln but not sessile cd64 th monocyte- derived cells are essential for the induction of itreg cells.the exact mechanisms controlling the functional switchbetween tolerogenic itreg-inducing versus immunogenic cd103 th dcs is elusive.

besides gm-csf ra andtlr2 signalling also b-catenin-dependent signals uptake of apoptotic dcs and pd-1 ligation may imprint foxp3 th treg induction reviewed in 21. in contrast it is much less clear which signals abrogate treg induction by dcs for examplein situations where induction of immunity is warranted.

although the above experiments suggest that cd40-signalling causes dcs to leave the lp we could not exclude an influence of inflammatory stimuli which have been previously reported to augment effects of cd40-ligation on dcs.

to analyse thefunctional role of cd40-signalling on itreg-inducing dcs in absence of other inflammatory signals in vivo we generated mice where cd11c th dcs receive a constitutive ligand-free cd40 signal.

as expression of the lmp1cd40 fusion protein in dcs was too low to be detected by western blot analysis or flow cytometry we analysed the expression of cre in intestinal dcs and macrophages indirectly with the help of tdrfp reporter mice which express loxp-flanked stop codon-protected rfp from the rosa26 locus.

therefore lmp1cd40-fusion protein expression was largely restricted to dcs and to mhcii thly6clow cd11c th macrophages in the intestine.expression of lmp1cd40 in dcs causes fatal colitis.

overall this data indicates that cd40-signalling in dcs was sufficient to induce fatal colitis which depends on both lymphocytes and the presence of high luminal loads ofcommensal bacteria.dc-lmp1cd40-mice have reduced frequencies of cd103 th dcs.

this finding indicates that cd103 - cd11b th dcs seem to be less susceptible to cd40-signal-induced migration as compared with cd103 dcs either induced by mab or by the lmpcd40 transgene 3a.

therefore in contrast to the increase in cd103 - dcs which is most likely caused by secondary inflammatory effects the loss of cd103 th dcs from lp is intrinsically caused by the lmp1cd40-transgene.to find out if the expression of lmpcd40 transgene wouldinduce dc-maturation we analysed surface markers and cytokine expression.
