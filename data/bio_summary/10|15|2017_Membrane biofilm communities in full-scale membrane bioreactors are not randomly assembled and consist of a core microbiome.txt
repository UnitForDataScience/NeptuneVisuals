also studies characterizing both the early colonizers and mature biofilm communities in mbrs are lacking.this study was motivated by two questions concerning the membrane biofilm communities early and mature in full-scale mbrs i is the assembly of biofilm communities early and mature the result of random immigration of species from the as community or the result of specific selection of certain species due to local conditions ii is there a core membrane biofilm com- munity in full-scale mbrs to address these questions 16s rrna gene sequencing combined with multivariate statistical analysis was applied to characterize the biofilm early and mature and as bacterial communities in five full-scale mbrs located in the same city seattle washington u.s.a. and equipped with the same membrane type and treating predominantly domestic wastewater.

for each mbr as early as mature and early mature correspond to the shared otus and sequences within two types of samples.a combined samples correspond to the five as five early biofilm or five mature biofilm samples collected from the 5 mbrs.unifrac distance  revealed clear differences in the bacterial community diversity between the as and early after only 5 h of filtration and mature biofilm samples in the full-scale mbrs.

in this study five full-scale mbrs located in seattle washington u.s.a. were selected to address two questions concerning membrane biofilm communities early and mature i is the assembly of biofilm communities early and mature the result of random immigration of species from the source community i.e.

activated sludge and ii is there a core membrane biofilm community in full-scale mbrs membrane biofilm early and mature and activated sludge as samples were collected from the five mbrs and 16s rrna gene sequencing was applied to investigate the bacterial communities of as and membrane biofilms early and mature.

the numbers from 1 to 5 refer to the five different full-scale mbrs.showed that the as and biofilm samples from each mbr were clustered together comparison of unweighted unifrac distance between samples in different categories revealed that as samples from the five mbrs were highly dissimilar from the biofilm samples early and mature and early biofilms were dissimilar from mature biofilms .

as early or mature .effect of source communityto estimate the probability that the biofilm communities early and mature represent random samples of their respective as communities the biofilm communities were compared to 1000 random subsamples of the as communities and the results were visualized on nmds plot based on the horn index .

as early or mature the five as five early or five mature biofilm samples from the five different mbrs were combined together.

also the shared otus correspond to the dominant otus 22e72 reads per otu averaging 49 reads per otu in each mbr plant whereas the unique otus correspond to the rare otus 3e10reads per otu averaging 4 reads per otu.discussionthe aim of this study was to evaluate if the assembly of biofilm communities in full-scale mbrs is random or the result of species sorting and to determine if a core biofilm early and mature community exists in full-scale mbrs.is the assembly of biofilm community early and mature the result of random immigration of species from the as community or the result of specific selection of certain species due to local conditionsalpha  and beta diversity measures using unweightedfig.

most community ecology studies of full-scale biological wastewater treatment plants havebeen limited to microbial diversity surveys of as communities and a major finding of these studies was the existence of some core as communities shared between geographically distributed biological wastewater treatment plants   which raises the question of whether a core biofilm community also exists in geographically distributed full- scale mbrs.while most previous studies have characterized the microbial communities in mature biofilms   some researchers claim that characterizing the early colonizers on membrane surfaces might help develop better biofouling control strategies yet few studies have addressed these early colonizers  .

due to technical reasons only five mbr plants were selected in this study and more comparative studies on full- scale mbrs are needed in the future to characterize the bacterial community structure of early colonizers with the aim of developing an effective global approach for mitigating biofouling in mbrs.conclusionsthe main outcomes of this study can be summarized as followsalpha and beta diversity measures showed clear differences in the community structure between activated sludge and biofilm communities early and mature in the five full-scale mbrs.

also most of these studies have characterized the mature biofilm commu- nities with very few studies addressing early biofilm communities.

alpha and beta diversity measures revealed clear differences in the bacterial community structure between the as and biofilm early and mature samples in the five full-scale mbrs.

despite the large fraction of shared sequence reads be- tween as and biofilm samples simulated biofilm communities from random sampling of the respective as community revealed that biofilm communities differed significantly from the random assemblages p  0.001 for each mbr indicating that the biofilm communities early and mature are unlikely to represent a random sample of the as community.

in addition to the presence of unique operational taxonomic units in each biofilm sample early or mature comparative analysis of operational taxonomic units and genera revealed the presence of a core biofilm community in the five full-scale mbrs.

finding more efficient strategies to control biofouling requires a more funda- mental understanding of the factors that shape membrane biofilm community assembly in mbrs.several sequential steps are generally considered to be involved in the progression of biofilm formation on surfaces beginning with the formation of a conditioning film followed by a series of ordered processes i attachment of pioneer colonizers onto surfaces ii growth of pioneer colonizers which change the surface charac- teristics of the substratum and facilitate the attachment of new organisms resulting in early biofilm formation and iii subsequent development to mature biofilms  .
