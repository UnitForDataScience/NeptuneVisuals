Among all cancer cases that were positive for F. nucleatum the level of F. nucleatum DNA content in esophageal and colorectal cancer ranged from 2.68x10-3 to 365.2x10-3 median 101.3x10-3 and from 2.10x10-3 to 166.7x10-3 median 5.08x10-3 respectively.Heterogeneity of F. nucleatum in esophageal cancer tissue.

in pancreatic cancer tissue was independently associated with the poor prognosis of patients 20.However whether F. nucleatum is present in other types of gastroenterological cancer including esophageal gastric or liver cancer has yet to be investigated.In the present study quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR method was evaluated to determine if it was able to detect the quantity of F. nucleatum DNA from an oral cavity.

To evaluate the heterogeneity of the F. nucleatum DNA within tumor tissues the F. nucleatum DNA in the superficial and invasive areas of the 5 esophageal cancer tissues that were positive for F. nucleatum were evaluated Fig.

In esophageal and colorectal cancer F. nucleatum was also detected in adjacent non-tumor tissue whereas F. nucleatum was not detected in the liver and pancreatic cancer tissuesFigure 2.

However the presence of F. nucleatum in esophageal and gastric cancer tissues remains to be investigated.In addition the F. nucleatum expression levels in superficial and invasive areas of esophageal cancer tissues were compared and an increased level was observed in superficial areas.

The involvement of F. nucleatum in tumor growth requires further investigation.In conclusion F. nucleatum DNA was detected in esopha- geal gastric and colorectal cancer but not in pancreatic and liver cancer.
