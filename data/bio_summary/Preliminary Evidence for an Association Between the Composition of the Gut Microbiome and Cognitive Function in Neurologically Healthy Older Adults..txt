Studies that more preciselymeasure dietary intake particularly feeding studies or the useof a more detailed diet log to log food intake over time andphysical activity such as actigraphy will help clarify theobserved association between the gut microbiome and cog-nitive function as dietary habits and physical activity areprimary contributors to gut microbiome composition andmay assist in disentangling the often inconsistent relation-ships between these factors and cognitive outcomes.In brief summary the present study found an associationbetween the composition of the gut microbiome andGut microbiome and cognitive function705cognitive functioning in a sample of healthy older adults.

Methods Participants were 43 community-dwelling older adults 50-85 years that completed a brief cognitive test battery and provided stool samples for gut microbiome sequencing.

Conclusions The current findings suggest that composition of the gut microbiome is associated with cognitive test performance in neurologically healthy older adults.

Dysbiosis can result from host or environmental factors and has been linked to several disease conditions including inflammatory bowel disease some types of cancer obesity and metabolic disorders Tilg  Kaser While research on the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain i.e.

The current study sought to further explore the possible association between the composition of the gut microbiome and cognitive function in a sample of healthy older adults.METHODSParticipantsA total of 43 older adults were recruited from a community recreation and wellness center 1.

Full interpretation of such findingsis difficult as the many factors influencing the compositionof the gut microbiome are just beginning to be understoodand very few studies have directly examined its possible linkto neurological function.

Chronic inflammation has long beenviewed as a contributor to cognitive decline Trollor et al.and there is some evidence that dysbiosis rather than aspecific phylum of bacteria may lead to greater inflammationTilg  Kaser Other possible mechanisms have also been suggested forthe link between the gut microbiome and neurocognitiveoutcomes including communication through the vagusnerve production of bacterial metabolites and enteroendo-crine signaling as reviewed by Sherwin Sandhu Dinan Cryan Each of these pathways has the potential toinfluence a wide range of physiological processes within thebrain.

Second the present study found across-sectional relationship between the gut microbiome andcognitive test scores but does not provide insight to possiblemechanisms or trajectories of such a relationship.

Prospectivestudies that include pre-pro-biotic supplementation will shedlight on the relationship between the gut microbiome andcognitive functioning as they have been proposed as possibletherapeutics for psychiatric conditions Sarkar et al.
