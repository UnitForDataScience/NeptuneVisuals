Elimination of CTXS E. coli popula- tions further demonstrated the return of the efficacy of the antibiotic that had been rendered ineffective by the presence of the resistance plasmids.In control mice that received the resistance plasmid but not the interference plasmid CTXR bacteria remained  Tables and  and specific rep and resistance genes In vivo cure of pEl1573-colonized mice.E.

Theoretically homologous recombination might restore toxin or antibiotic resistance genes to an interference plasmid although a less resistant addictive plasmid or a non-addictive resistance plasmid both seem preferable options to persistence of the original addictive resistance plasmid.

Modern resistance plasmids may spread through a range of different member species of the Enterobacteriaceae asa plasmid epidemic but host strain contributions to plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance phenotypes  further complicate surveillance and control  .

A conjugative resistance plasmid in the microflora directly increases risk of therapeutic failure  and may spread resistance to others.

Even when spread of a particular resistance plasmid is defined early enough for implementation of containment strat- egies the only available option is to use an antibiotic to which the plasmid does not confer resistance in an attempt to entirely eliminate all bacterial populations that carry it.Older antibiotics and those not used as primary therapy in severe sepsis may provide options for killing bacterial populations harbouring dangerous plasmids.

Plasmids encoding resistance to carbapenems andor third-generation cephalosporins which often also carry aminoglycoside resistance determinants are the highest priority for elimination.

The resistance region and principal toxin gene of pJIBE401 and pJIE512b were replaced with tetA or fosA3 retaining the antitoxin gene and introducing resistance to tetracycline TETR and fosfomycin FOSR .

coli K. pneumoniae Citrobacter freundii or Morganella morganii  carrying the respective CTXR resistance plasmid pEl1573 or pJIE512b appeared to result in loss of the resistance plasmid only after purifying selection on RIF-TET agar with bystander plasmids preserved .

Protocols based on published work  were used to introduce resistance and then inter- ference plasmids in bacteria with different chromosomal resistance markers rifampicinRIFR or azide AZIR  to allow tracking of both strains and plasmids by differential subculture.

Only antibiotic-susceptible origi- nally resident TETS CTXS E. coli AZIR TETS CTXS E. coli and RIFR TETS CTXS E. coli bacteria used to introduce resistance or interference plasmid now carrying neither were retrieved and these were present in comparable proportions 104-105 cfumg of faeces Tables and .CTX was finally re-administered days 23 24 to select for any residual resistance CTXR plasmids or transferred genes that may not have been detected by culture or direct PCR.
