Ryan demonstrated shifts in the com- position of the gut microbiome in apoE-deficient mice fed high fatcholesterol in conjunction withplant sterol esters or oat b-glucan and increased con- centrations of cecum acetate or butyrate and found that these feedings attenuated the microbial produc- tion of TMA and reduced serum cholesterol concen- trations80.In accordance with experimental data recent clinical work has shown that coronary artery disease is linked with an alternation of gut microbiota and that gut microbiota may be a diagnostic marker of morbid- ity from coronary artery disease81 82.

reported that the incidence of coronary artery disease is related to a decreased prevalence of the phylum Bac- teroidetes and increased FB ratio in the intestinal tract81.Therefore it is possible that the use of SCFAs prebiotics or probiotics live microbiota to improve the gut microbiota environment can allow SCFAs to prevent metabolic disorders and prevent ASCVD.Short Chain Fatty Acids and Visceral Adipose TissuesAdipose tissues not only store energy through the accumulation of triglycerides but secrete various adi- pokines that affect metabolism throughout the body.

The interaction between microbiota and the host influences immunological homeostasis and changes in this interaction are associated with various inflammatory diseases3.Fatty acids with a carbon number between 2 and 6 are considered short chain fatty acids SCFAs and have the following names C2 acetic C3 propionicAddress for correspondence Hideo Ohira Division of Clini- cal Nutrition Faculty of Nutrition Kobe Gakuin University 518 Arise Ikawadani-cho Nishi-ku Kobe 6512180 JapanE-mail Received April 4 2017Accepted for publication April 7 2017C4 butyric C5 valeric and C6 caproic acid.

Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota and the metagenome are associ- ated with the inflammatory condition known as ath- erogenesis6 7.

As for the connections between gut microbiota immunity and atherosclerosis recent excellent reviews should also be consulted8-11.Table 1.

They alsofound that gut microbiota can regulate cholesterol homeostasis via bile acid metabolism under hypercho- lesterolemia79.
