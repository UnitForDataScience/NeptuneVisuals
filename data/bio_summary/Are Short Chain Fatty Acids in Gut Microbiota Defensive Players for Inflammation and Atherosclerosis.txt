more than 1 mmoll of butyrate induces fas-mediated apoptosis of t cells by inhibiting hdac1 activity to induce fas promoter hyperacetylation and fas upregulation in t cells57.when butyrate is supplied into the colons of t cell-dependent colitis mouse models the number oftable 2. fecal concentration of individual scfas acetate propionate butyrate by human adultscitationed from verbeke ka et al.

oral administration of tributyrin a prodrug of butyrate increased plasma butyrate concentrations in the portal vein to 2.4 mmoll at 1 h and 0.7 mmoll at 2.5 h38.short chain fatty acids and their receptorsseveral receptors for scfas have been found to be g-protein coupled receptors gpr.

butyrate 1.0 mmoll inhibits the prolifera- tion of t lymphocytes and more than 2.0 mmoll of butyrate induces apoptosis in activated t lymphocytes but not primary macrophages52.

on the other hand 1 mmoll of butyrate causes the induction of th17 cells and also exacerbates inflammation by the production of il-23 in stimu- lated dendritic cells dcs60.thus scfas especially butyrate and propio- nate play a complicated role in treg differentiation and intestinal tract immune regulation9 53 61 62.short chain fatty acids and neutrophils monocytes and macrophagesthe chemotaxis of neutrophils is activated by inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factortnf-a il-17 etc.

butyrate increases the production of pge2 by upregulating the expression of phospholipase a2 pla2 and cyclooxygenase-2 cox2 in kupffer cells at butyrate concentrations of 0.5-10 mmoll71 in human peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells 1.0-2.0 mmoll72 and in a mouse macrophage cell line 0.2-1.0 mmoll73 fig.

have shown that butyrate propionate and acetate protect against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance and that butyrate and propionate but not acetate induce gut hormones and reduce food intake98.

the major scfas acetates propionate and butyrate have different production ratios and physiological activities.

in the future scfas may provide new insights into understanding the pathophysiology of chronic inflammation metabolic disorders and atherosclerosis and we can expect the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these diseases.key words short chain fatty acids butyrate microbiota inflammation atherosclerosiscopyrightc2017 japan atherosclerosis societythis article is distributed under the terms of the latest version of cc by-nc-sa defined by the creative commons attribution license.introductionthere are up to 100 trillion 1x1014 microbes in the human intestinal tract1 including bacteria fungi and viruses.

recent studies suggest that gut microbiota and the metagenome are associ- ated with the inflammatory condition known as ath- erogenesis6 7. this brief review will focus on scfas especially butyrate and their effects on various inflam- matory mechanisms including atherosclerosis.
