In general for the Control inoculum the source for nearly all genera could be identified whereas for the STAT inoculum there was somewhat less identification by source donor reflecting in part the extensive intragroup variation in the recipients of the STAT inoculum Supplementary Figure 11.We hypothesized that there would be a bottleneck with the transfer of the inoculum to the new hosts and the figures showing a-diversity Supplementary Figure 3b-d clearly indicate that for the dams.

a-c Numbers of mice are as in Supplementary Table 1. a Percentage of inoculum OTUsshared by that inoculum and the mouse group that received that inoculum.

In genomic studies Akkermansia has been shown to contain the glycosulfatases needed to contribute to the pathway.31 This finding is consistent with the taxonomic studies based on 16S analyses that show the high abundance of Verrucomicrobiae in the inoculum Supplementary Figure 1a and in the STAT compared to Control dams and pups especially in the IL10-- background Supplementary Figure 4c.

MetaCyc pathway abundances generated using HUMAnN2.Significance was determined by PERMANOVA P 0.001 WT vs. IL10-- all P 0.12 Control vs STAT WT P 0.04 Control vs STAT IL10-- P 0.04 Control vs Control P0.03 STAT vs STAT.

IL-10-- dams receiving the control inoculum have lower within-mouse variability than wild-type WT mice receiving the control inoculum but this does not hold true for pups.

IL10-- pups receiving the STAT inoculum have lower within- mouse variability than wild-type WT mice receiving the STAT inoculum but this does not hold true for dams.

See Supplementary Table 8. d Median Jaccard index values were calculated for each sample's pairwise comparison between the indicated groups Inoculum vs. dams dams vs. dams etc.Boxplots indicate the median values with interquartile range.

The imputed sources are shown for the introduced taxa from the Control inoculum top panel and STAT inoculum bottom panel.

Numbers of mice studied for dams pups respectively in each of the 4 groups are IL10-- Control 5 15- 42 WT Control7 20 IL10-- STAT5 10-34 WT STAT 6 15.
