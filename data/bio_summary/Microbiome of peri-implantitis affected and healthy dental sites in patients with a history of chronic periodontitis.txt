two of the healthy samples 1h 5h were significant outliers in terms of microbiome composition.microbial profiles from peri-implantitis samples were less diverse than healthy samples but this failed to reach statistical significance by estimated species richness chao-1 a p  0.104. the shannon diversity index b revealed that the peri-implantitis samples were overall less diverse but displayed higher abundance of individual taxa compared to the healthy samples p  0.0142. on average healthy samples harboured 250 otus sd 30.5 range 210-295 while sam- ples from cases of peri-implantitis contained 215 otus sd 19.6 range 168-241.compositional differences between the groupslinear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse was used to assess the differences between the two groups of samples both at the otu level and at the genus or higher taxonomic level.

these findings indicate that the communities in both health and disease are somewhat dissimilar but in general most taxa were present in both conditions albeit detected in smaller numbers of samples and proportions between health and disease ff.there was greater subject to subject variation in the microflorafound at healthy sites than at disease sites as shown by principal component analysis where it was observed that the diseased samples clustered closer together than the healthy samples.

furthermore the most common genera in health actinomyces and streptococcus and disease porphyromonas and prevotella demonstrated greater subject-to-subject variability in the healthy samples compared to the diseased samples.dissimilarities exist between peri-implantitis and periodontitis le- sions due to histopathological differences between them and the pro- gression rate of disease as the host response at implant sites may be different than at tooth sites when biofilms persist for prolonged time .

from all otus 55 otus were statistically significantly different between the healthy and peri-implantitis samples p  0.05 lda  2.5. there was an approximately even split in the numbers of discriminating otus be- tween healthy and diseased samples of these 55 taxa 26 were asso- ciated with disease .

however methodological variations across studies and lack of reporting con- founding factors in the literature such as smoking impedes the ability to draw definite conclusions regarding history of periodontal disease and occurrence of peri-implantitis albeit the general agreement of sys- tematic reviews that subjects with a history of periodontitis are at greater risk for peri-implant disease .current findings demonstrated that more periodontal pathogens from genera such as bacteroides prevotella porphyromonas treponema tannerella were present in peri-implantitis lesions in line with previous observations  .

a significantly in- creased incidence of peri-implantitis and peri-implant marginal bone loss was found in subjects with periodontitis-associated tooth loss  and although there were no statistically significant differences in both short-  5 yearsand long-term 5 years implant survival between patients with a history of chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy individuals the data suggested that the former subjects may exhibit significantly greater long-term probing pocket depth peri-implant marginal bone loss and incidence of peri-implantitis compared with periodontally healthy subjects .

whether this hypothesis applies to peri- implantitis lesions or the speculation that peri-implantitis is a simple infection  warrants further investigation.it was of interest to observe that in edentulous subject 10 from whom plaque samples were collected from disease-free implants and from one implant with peri-implantitis regardless of the similarities in the structure of the surrounding tissues and in the properties of the fixture surfaces biofilm formation between healthy and diseased im- plants differed   and its composition in the control implants followed the general observation noted for the healthy dental sites.

the homogeneity elements sought by the study limited the size of suitable participants.patients with similar characteristics in whom control of periodontal disease preceded implant placement are routinely treated in a dental practice and it is of clinical interest to understand the microbiological mechanisms that underlie disease presence at peri-implant tissues amid low levels of periodontal disease in the natural dentition.

differences between dental and implant sites were determined using linear discriminant analysis effect size and diversity analyses were conducted using past v3.02.results the microbiomes of healthy samples were more diverse than those found in disease although disease was associated with a higher abundance of taxa relative to health.

the most discriminative genera between health and disease were actinomyces and streptococcus in health and prevotella and porphyromonas in peri-implantitis with statistically sig- nificant differences between health and disease observed for three of the four genera .

species within this phylum have also been implicated in periodontal disease  gastro- intestinal infections and soft tissue infections  and appear to be highly associated with peri-implantitis   which is in line with current findings suggesting that it might constitute a suitable microbiological indicator for disease diag- nosis .

only 55 otus were sig- nificantly different between the healthy and peri-implantitis samples 26 were associated with disease and 29 with health.

after subsampling at an equal depth of 80000 readssample there were a total of 4300 otus in the diseased samples and a total of 3289 otus in the healthy samples that were used for further analyses.microbial profile analysespca revealed clear difference between microbiomes from healthy samples and those from peri-implantitis cases .
