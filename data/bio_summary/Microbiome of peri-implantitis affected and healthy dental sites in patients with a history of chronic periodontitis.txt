These findings indicate that the communities in both health and disease are somewhat dissimilar but in general most taxa were present in both conditions albeit detected in smaller numbers of samples and proportions between health and disease ff.There was greater subject to subject variation in the microflorafound at healthy sites than at disease sites as shown by principal component analysis where it was observed that the diseased samples clustered closer together than the healthy samples.

Furthermore the most common genera in health Actinomyces and Streptococcus and disease Porphyromonas and Prevotella demonstrated greater subject-to-subject variability in the healthy samples compared to the diseased samples.Dissimilarities exist between peri-implantitis and periodontitis le- sions due to histopathological differences between them and the pro- gression rate of disease as the host response at implant sites may be different than at tooth sites when biofilms persist for prolonged time .

A significantly in- creased incidence of peri-implantitis and peri-implant marginal bone loss was found in subjects with periodontitis-associated tooth loss  and although there were no statistically significant differences in both short-  5 yearsand long-term 5 years implant survival between patients with a history of chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy individuals the data suggested that the former subjects may exhibit significantly greater long-term probing pocket depth peri-implant marginal bone loss and incidence of peri-implantitis compared with periodontally healthy subjects .

Whether this hypothesis applies to peri- implantitis lesions or the speculation that peri-implantitis is a simple infection  warrants further investigation.It was of interest to observe that in edentulous subject 10 from whom plaque samples were collected from disease-free implants and from one implant with peri-implantitis regardless of the similarities in the structure of the surrounding tissues and in the properties of the fixture surfaces biofilm formation between healthy and diseased im- plants differed   and its composition in the control implants followed the general observation noted for the healthy dental sites.

The homogeneity elements sought by the study limited the size of suitable participants.Patients with similar characteristics in whom control of periodontal disease preceded implant placement are routinely treated in a dental practice and it is of clinical interest to understand the microbiological mechanisms that underlie disease presence at peri-implant tissues amid low levels of periodontal disease in the natural dentition.

Differences between dental and implant sites were determined using linear discriminant analysis effect size and diversity analyses were conducted using PAST v3.02.Results The microbiomes of healthy samples were more diverse than those found in disease although disease was associated with a higher abundance of taxa relative to health.

Plaque samples were collected from one diseased implant with peri-implantitis functional for at least two years and healthy sites in ten non-smokers who had received periodontal treatment prior to implant placement.
