Statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney test or two-way ANOVA with Fisher's post-test where appropriate p  0.05 p 0.005 and p  0.0005.Figure 2Chronic Exposure to TNF Contributes to Increased Inflammatory Responses and Tissue Damage that Occur with AgeYoung and old murine bone marrow macrophage-mediated killing of S. pneumoniae is decreased in the presence of 10 ngmL exogenous TNF n  5.Unlike old WT mice old TNF KO mice do not have increased levels of plasma IL6 n  3-10 mice per group one of two independent experiments shown.IL6 production in the whole blood of young and old TNF KO mice following stimulation with LPS or a vehicle control PBS demonstrates that old TNF KO mice do not have higher inflammatory responses to LPS compared to young mice n  5.IL6 levels as detected by ELISA in whole-lung tissue homogenates were no higher in old TNF KO mice than in young TNF mice n  3.HE stain of formalin-fixed histological sections of lungs of young and old TNF KO mice 20x magnification one representative of at least four.

This demonstrates that the age of the microbiota alters barrier function.Colonization of young GF mice with old microbiota increased paracellular permeability compared to those colonized with young microbiota however old mice colonized with either young or old microbiota demonstrated increased permeability indicating that age-related changes in the host increased susceptibility to the microbiota.Circulating TNF was measured from all the young GF mice n  13 total n  5 colonized with young microbiota and n  8 colonized with old microbiota and old GF mice n  11 total n  5 colonized with the young microbiota and n  6 colonized with the old microbiota.

Althoughold mice colonized with the old microbiota had the greatest degree of permeability old mice colonized with the young microbiota also had an increase in permeability implying that there are age-related changes in the gut that predispose to barrier dysfunction G.In addition to the paracellular permeability the age of the host contributed to levels of circulating TNF  H. Circulating TNF was measured from all the young GF mice n  13 total n  5 colonized with young microbiota and n  8 colonized with old microbiota and old GF mice n  11 total n  5 colonized with the young microbiota and n  6 colonized with the old microbiota.

Old 18 months ASF mice had higher intestinal permeability than young 10- 14 weeks ASF mice in addition to higher levels of plasma IL6 B.IL6 production after LPS stimulation in whole blood was higher in old ASF mice n  3.The taxa summary of microbiota of young and old ASF mice indicates that age-related microbial dysbiosis occurs.Taxa summaries illustrate that the composition of the young and old microbiota is retained upon transfer to young or old GF mice n  5-16 micegroup over four independent colonization experiments.Paracellular permeability was measured in GF mice colonized with young and old microbiota n  6-8 mice per group.

In contrast to WT animals aged TNF knockout KO mice did not have greater levels of IL6 in the circulation in the steady state B and when LPS was added to whole blood old TNF KO mice did not produce higher amounts of IL6 than the stimulated blood of young mice C. Constitutive IL6 production was not affected by age in TNF KO lung slices D and pulmonary cellular infiltrates were not observed in old mice demonstrating protection from inflammation in the lungs E Finally bone marrow-derived macrophages from old TNF KO mice did not have impaired pneumococcal killing in contrast to old WT mice F. Thus age-associated inflammation and more specifically chronic exposure to TNF contribute to changes in macrophage function resulting in decreased S. pneumoniae killing capacity.Intestinal Permeability and Levels of Circulating Bacterial Products Increase with AgeAlthough our data demonstrated that the presence of TNF promoted systemic inflammation and impaired macrophage function the cause of increased TNF production with age was unclear.

Statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney test or two-way ANOVA with Fisher's post-test where appropriate p  0.05 p  0.005 and p  0.0005.Figure 3The Microbiota Increase Intestinal Permeability Age-Associated Inflammation Macrophage Function and LongevityIntestinal permeability of aging mice 3 12 15 and 18 months old was measured by FITC-dextran translocation to the circulation following oral gavage n  4-8 and it was found to increase significantly with age p  0.007 one-way ANOVA.Colons of young and old mice do not have detectable changes in either epithelial architecture or inflammatory infiltrate when measured as described in the STAR Methods.Mucosal-to-serosal flux of 51Cr-EDTA as measured in Ussing chambers was used to measure the paracellular permeability of ileums and colons from young and old WT mice n  6-12.Circulating muramyl dipeptide MDP in the plasma of young and old WT mice as measured by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein NOD-nuclear factor kB NF-kB promoter bioassay.

Statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney test or two-way ANOVA with Fisher's post-test or unpaired t test where appropriate p  0.05 p  0.005 and p  0.0005.Figure 5Microbial Dysbiosis Occurs with Age and InflammationIntestinal permeability as measured by plasma FITC-dextran following oral gavage was increased in old WTSPF mice but not old TNF KO or old GF mice.Circulating MDP is increased in old SPFWT mice.

Using old 18-22 months germ-free mice which do not have age-associated inflammation we demonstrate that colonization with the microbiota from old mice drives the inflammation that accompanies aging.ResultsTNF Drives Age-Associated Defects in Macrophage FunctionWe found that after normalizing for differences in bacterial uptake between mice resident peritoneal  A and bone marrow-derived B macrophages from old wild-type WT mice 18- 22 months were impaired in their ability to kill Streptococcus pneumoniae as compared to those fromyoung WT mice 10-14 weeks.

The paracellular permeability was measured from all the GF mice colonized with the microbiota sourced from old micen  23 total n  11 young mice and n  12 old mice compared to young microbiota n  13 n  6 young mice and n  7 old mice.
