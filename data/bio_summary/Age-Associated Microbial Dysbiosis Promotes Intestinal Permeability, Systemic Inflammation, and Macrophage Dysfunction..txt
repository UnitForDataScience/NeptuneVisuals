this demonstrates that the age of the microbiota alters barrier function.colonization of young gf mice with old microbiota increased paracellular permeability compared to those colonized with young microbiota however old mice colonized with either young or old microbiota demonstrated increased permeability indicating that age-related changes in the host increased susceptibility to the microbiota.circulating tnf was measured from all the young gf mice n  13 total n  5 colonized with young microbiota and n  8 colonized with old microbiota and old gf mice n  11 total n  5 colonized with the young microbiota and n  6 colonized with the old microbiota.

althoughold mice colonized with the old microbiota had the greatest degree of permeability old mice colonized with the young microbiota also had an increase in permeability implying that there are age-related changes in the gut that predispose to barrier dysfunction g.in addition to the paracellular permeability the age of the host contributed to levels of circulating tnf  h. circulating tnf was measured from all the young gf mice n  13 total n  5 colonized with young microbiota and n  8 colonized with old microbiota and old gf mice n  11 total n  5 colonized with the young microbiota and n  6 colonized with the old microbiota.

in contrast to wt animals aged tnf knockout ko mice did not have greater levels of il6 in the circulation in the steady state b and when lps was added to whole blood old tnf ko mice did not produce higher amounts of il6 than the stimulated blood of young mice c. constitutive il6 production was not affected by age in tnf ko lung slices d and pulmonary cellular infiltrates were not observed in old mice demonstrating protection from inflammation in the lungs e finally bone marrow-derived macrophages from old tnf ko mice did not have impaired pneumococcal killing in contrast to old wt mice f. thus age-associated inflammation and more specifically chronic exposure to tnf contribute to changes in macrophage function resulting in decreased s. pneumoniae killing capacity.intestinal permeability and levels of circulating bacterial products increase with agealthough our data demonstrated that the presence of tnf promoted systemic inflammation and impaired macrophage function the cause of increased tnf production with age was unclear.

using old 18-22 months germ-free mice which do not have age-associated inflammation we demonstrate that colonization with the microbiota from old mice drives the inflammation that accompanies aging.resultstnf drives age-associated defects in macrophage functionwe found that after normalizing for differences in bacterial uptake between mice resident peritoneal  a and bone marrow-derived b macrophages from old wild-type wt mice 18- 22 months were impaired in their ability to kill streptococcus pneumoniae as compared to those fromyoung wt mice 10-14 weeks.

the paracellular permeability was measured from all the gf mice colonized with the microbiota sourced from old micen  23 total n  11 young mice and n  12 old mice compared to young microbiota n  13 n  6 young mice and n  7 old mice.

old recipients had higher levels of circulating tnf than young recipients h. young gf mice that were colonized with old spf microbiota had higher levels of plasma tnf than those recolonized with young spf microbiota  h indicating that the specific composition of the aging microbial community contributes to age- associated inflammation but there are age-related changes that predispose old mice to increased inflammation when they are exposed to any microbiota i. these data indicate that the composition of the aged microbiota altered intestinal permeability but that the composition of the microbiota interacts with other age-related changes in the host to enhance systemic inflammation.a reciprocal relationship between age-associated inflammation and microbial dysbiosisour data demonstrate that the gut microbiota andor age-related microbial dysbiosis can lead to increased gut permeability with age and result in age-associated inflammation.

average distances between the young and old wt mice were greater than the young and old tnf ko mice indicating that the beta diversity was greater between young and old wt mice p  0.04 mann-whitney test.
