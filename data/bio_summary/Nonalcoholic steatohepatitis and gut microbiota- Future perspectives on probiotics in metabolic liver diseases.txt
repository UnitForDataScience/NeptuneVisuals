While only a small proportion of patients with simple steatosis the ear- liest form of NAFLD eventually progress to NASH with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis the recent increase in NAFLD rates is such that even a small proportion of patients who develop NASH-related complications cardiovascular disease advanced fi- brosis cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma will lead to a significant burden to the healthcare system 34.

Second patients with significant fibrosis F2 had significantly higher Enterobacteriaceae proportions compared with patients with nomild fibrosis F0F1.

Finally Bifidobacterium infantis was found in the feces of patients with NASH but not in those of healthy controls.The depletion of A. muciniphila the sole intestinal representa- tive of the verrucomicrobia in human feces is associated with a reduction in the protective inner mucus layer ultimately re- ducing the intestinal barrier integrity and promoting bacterial component and endotoxin leakage from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver.

These epidemiological trends are particularly concerning given the increasing effect of NAFLD on the rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease thus leading to the need for liver trans- plantation 1.

Thus lifestyle interventions diet and physical activityex- ercise continue to remain the cornerstone for clini- cally managing patients in the spectrum of NAFLD 5.

Via a quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR approach the study published in the current issue of the Turkish Journal of Gastroenterol- ogy investigated the differences in the gut microbi- ota between patients with biopsy-proven NASH and healthy controls.

First the gut microbiota of patients with NASH was characterized by significantly decreased Akkermansia muciniphila and increased Enterobacteriaceae proportions com- pared with that of healthy controls even after statisti- cal adjustment for age and body mass index.

Third se- rum endotoxin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients with NASHAddress for Correspondence Yusuf Yilmaz E-mail c Copyright 2017 by The Turkish Society of Gastroenterology  Available online at  DOI 10.5152tjg.2017.030817327Yilmaz and Eren.

Hopefully a more in-depth knowledge of the gut microbiota in patients with NASH could ultimately lead to new targeted preventive approaches.
