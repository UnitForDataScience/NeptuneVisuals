Interest- ingly and contrary to the notion that the SCFA-producing capacity of the gut microbiota may be detrimental to obese individuals relative concentrations of SCFA and BCoAT were associated with lower body fat  higher lean mass and higher V.

thus further validating that gut microbiota composition is dependent on PA status.DISCUSSIONIn this study we provide evidence that 6 wk of aerobic ex- ercise training alters the gut microbiota and microbial-derived SCFA in previously sedentary lean and obese adults without any changes to dietary patterns.

We investigated the effects of exercise training on fecal SCFA concentrations and genes within the gut microbiota important for SCFA production and observed that aerobic exercise increased fecal concentrations of the three most abundant SCFA acetate C2 propionate C3 and butyrate C4.

However con- sidering the wide-ranging effectiveness of exercise interventions in combating weight gain and obesity-associated comorbidities in humans 19 a more comprehensive investigation into the biological systems that are responsive to both obesity and ex- ercise training including the gut microbiota is needed.In this study we investigated whether 6 wk of aerobic exercise training alters gut microbial communities and fecal SCFA in previously sedentary lean and obese adults with controls in place to ensure consistent dietary patterns.

Additionally we demonstrate that exercise-induced modulations of the gut microbiota and SCFA were strongly associated with changes in body composition in lean participantsand V. O2max in obese participants highlighting the role of the gutmicrobiota in regulating physiological adaptations to exercise training.

We hypothesized that exercise training would stimulate orthog- onal shifts in gut microbial communities dependent on body mass index BMI status and lead to increased fecal SCFA levels as well as functional metabolic capacity for the gut microbiota to produce SCFA.

Moreover it is possible that these shifts in SCFA genetic machinery may augment responses to other envi- ronmental cues within the gut including increased potential for dietary fiber fermentation ultimately leading to increased SCFA production 31.Exercise-induced increases in fecal BCoAT and SCFA levels also strongly paralleled improvements in body com- position including most notably increases in lean mass.

No differences in -diversity of the microbiota were observed between lean and obese participants at baseline see Figure Supplemental Digital Content 3 Rarefaction -diversity plot P 9 0.05 or at any of remaining collection time points P 9 0.05 data not shown.Exercise training increased fecal SCFA concen- trations and gut microbiome SCFA-producing ca- pacity depending on BMI status.

To determine if exercise caused physiologically relevant changes in gut microbiota composition principle component factor analysis PCA was completed on the change scores of bacterial genera E0-E6 that paralleled similar changes in SCFA fecal bu-tyrate or BCoAT or cardiorespiratory fitness V.
