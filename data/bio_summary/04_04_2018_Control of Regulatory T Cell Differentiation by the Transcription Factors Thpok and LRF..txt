Thus Thpok and LRF redundantly support the CD4CD82 expression pattern of Tregs as they do for conventional CD4 T cells 16 42.Thpok and LRF affect Treg functions independently of Runx3 repressionIn thymocytes and conventional T cells Thpok acts by inhibiting the expression and function of the transcription factor Runx3 16 39 42. dKO Tregs had increased levels of Runx3 but not of its homolog Runx1 which is expressed in wild-type Tregs Fig.

Of note disruption of the Foxp3 CNS2 cis-regulatory element which destabilizes Foxp3 expression but does not affect the function of remaining Foxp3 Tregs has a much milder impact on immune homeostasis than does disruption of Thpok and LRF 45 46.The functions of Thpok and LRF in Tregs differ in three important respects from those in conventional CD4 T cells.

Whereas in conventional CD4 T cells Thpok inhibits the expression of cytotoxic genes 17 27 many of these genes including that for granzyme B are normally expressed in Tregs despite Thpok expression 73 74.

3C this indi- cated that the impact of Thpok and LRF on Tregs is not mediated by their effect on CD4 expression and thereby MHC-II-induced TCR signaling 43 44.Effect of Thpok and LRF on Treg stabilityIt was reported that environmental cues in the small intestine at the interface of the epithelial layer and of the lamina propria siLP the main site of immune activity at steady-state repress Thpok resulting in Foxp3 silencing and conversion of Foxp3CD4 Tregs into Foxp32 CD4CD8aCD8b2 ex Treg intraepithelial lymphocytes IELs 20 accordingly inducible Thpok disruption resulted in the generation of Foxp32CD4CD8 ex Tregs 20.

Unexpectedly this was not the case as the requirement for Thpok is not relieved by enforced expression of CD4.Given the role of Thpok in stabilizing Foxp3 expression in in- testinal Tregs 20 it is possible that Thpok contributes to Foxp3 expression in thymocytes.

Our study supports the conclusion that the main function of Thpok and LRF in postthymic Tregs is to support Foxp3-mediated gene expression rather than to maintain expression of Foxp3 itself.This conclusion appears at odds with our observation and a previous report 20 that Thpok contributes to stabilize Foxp3 expression with little functional overlap with LRF.

Sign up at Control of Regulatory T Cell Differentiation by the Transcription Factors Thpok and LRFAndrea C. Carpenter Elizabeth Wohlfert1 Laura B. Choppx Melanie S. y The CD4 lineage-specific transcription factor Thpok is required for intrathymic CD4 T cell differentiation and together with its homolog LRF supports CD4 T cell helper effector responses.

We retrovirally transduced Foxp3 in conventional T cells either Thpok and LRF sufficient CD4 and CD8 T cells from wild-type mice or Thpok and LRF deficient CD8 T cells from B2m22 Thpokflfl Lrfflfl Cd4-Cre mice which all are MHC-II restricted.
