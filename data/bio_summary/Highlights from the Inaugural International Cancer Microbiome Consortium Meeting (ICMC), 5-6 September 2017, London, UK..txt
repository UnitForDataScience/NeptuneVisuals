what are the broad molecular mechanisms by which microorganisms may cause cancer--can we classify themthe 'driverpassenger model' and the 'alpha-bug hypothesis' are two conceptual models by which dysbiosis may cause colorectal cancer.

are these models generalisable to other cancers or do we need other models is there a unifying model to describe how dysbiosis may cause cancer in generalwith respect to dysbiosis and carcinogenesis have we moved beyond association to causationsession three co-factors in microbiome-induced carcinogenesisare there host genetic andor epigenetic factors which influence the oncogenic potential of the human microbiomehow do environmental factors--such as diet smoking stress exercise drugs and alcohol amongst others--interact with the microbiome to promote carcinogenesissession four safe exploitation of the microbiome for therapeutic benefithow might the microbiome be exploited for therapeutic benefit in cancer prevention diagnosis prognostication and treatmenthow can we research microbiome manipulation in oncology patients does this have patient safety implicationsday two--expert roundtable discussion on the role of the human microbiome in carcinogenesisin the roundtable discussion contributors addressed pre-agreed questions regarding the role of the human microbiome in carcinogenesis box 2. selected experts delivered short talks to address a specific question and stimulate discussion.

email abstractthe international cancer microbiome consortium icmc is a recently launched collaborative between academics and academic-clinicians that aims to promote microbiome research within the field of oncology establish expert consensus and deliver education for academics and clinicians.

the inaugural two-day meeting was held at the royal society of medicine rsm london uk 5-6 september 2017. microbi- ome and cancer experts from around the world first delivered a series of talks during an educational day and then sat for a day of roundtable discussion to debate key topics in microbiome-cancer research.talks delivered during the educational day covered a broad range of microbiome-related topics.

the potential role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer was discussed and debated in detail with experts highlighting the latest data in animal models and humans and addressing the question of causation versus association.

the microbiome represents a novel target for therapeutic manipulation in cancer and a number of talks explored how this might be realised through diet faecal microbiota transplant and chemotherapeutics.on the second day experts debated pre-agreed topics with the aim of producing a consensus statement with a focus on the current state of our knowledge and key gaps for further development.

the panel debated the notion of a 'healthy' microbiome and in turn the concept of dysbiosis in cancer.

on the second day experts met for a roundtable discussion to develop a consensus statement regard- ing the role of the microbiome in carcinogenesis with a focus on the current state of our knowledge and key gaps for further development.day one--'the microbiome in cancer and beyond' educational eventthe educational event was run in conjunction with the trainees section of the rsm and saw 16 academics and academic-clinicians from europe the americas and asia deliver a wide range of talks on the clinically relevant aspects of microbiome research.
