To conclude the roundtable discussed how the microbiome may be exploited for therapeutic benefit in cancer and the safety implications of performing such research in oncology patients.Keywords microbiome microbiota cancer gut consortiumPublished 20122017Received 07112017ecancer 2017 11791 httpsdoi.org10.3332ecancer.2017.791Copyright c the authors licensee ecancermedicalscience.

Lastly Professor Luis Mur described distinct microbiome changes in the sputum from patients with lung cancer and raised the possibility of bacterial biomarkers for lung cancer .Box 1.

Agenda for discussion by the roundtable.Session One Output from ICMCAs a consortium of experts with an interest in the microbiome what should we aim to achieve and how might we collaborate constructively in this regardWhen considering the 'microbiome' as an aetiological agent in cancer can we create a useful framework that acknowledges carcinogenesis induced by pathogens--such as H. pylori and HPV--compared to pathobiont-associated cancer resulting from dysbiosisSession Two Molecular mechanisms of microbiome-induced carcinogenesisMicroorganisms may influence carcinogenesis in a variety of ways.

What are the broad molecular mechanisms by which microorganisms may cause cancer--can we classify themThe 'driverpassenger model' and the 'alpha-bug hypothesis' are two conceptual models by which dysbiosis may cause colorectal cancer.

Are these models generalisable to other cancers or do we need other models Is there a unifying model to describe how dysbiosis may cause cancer in generalWith respect to dysbiosis and carcinogenesis have we moved beyond association to causationSession Three Co-factors in microbiome-induced carcinogenesisAre there host genetic andor epigenetic factors which influence the oncogenic potential of the human microbiomeHow do environmental factors--such as diet smoking stress exercise drugs and alcohol amongst others--interact with the microbiome to promote carcinogenesisSession Four Safe exploitation of the microbiome for therapeutic benefitHow might the microbiome be exploited for therapeutic benefit in cancer prevention diagnosis prognostication and treatmentHow can we research microbiome manipulation in oncology patients Does this have patient safety implicationsDay two--expert roundtable discussion on the role of the human microbiome in carcinogenesisIn the roundtable discussion contributors addressed pre-agreed questions regarding the role of the human microbiome in carcinogenesis Box 2.

Microbi- ome and cancer experts from around the world first delivered a series of talks during an educational day and then sat for a day of roundtable discussion to debate key topics in microbiome-cancer research.Talks delivered during the educational day covered a broad range of microbiome-related topics.

The potential role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer was discussed and debated in detail with experts highlighting the latest data in animal models and humans and addressing the question of causation versus association.

The microbiome represents a novel target for therapeutic manipulation in cancer and a number of talks explored how this might be realised through diet faecal microbiota transplant and chemotherapeutics.On the second day experts debated pre-agreed topics with the aim of producing a consensus statement with a focus on the current state of our knowledge and key gaps for further development.

The panel debated the notion of a 'healthy' microbiome and in turn the concept of dysbiosis in cancer.
