This resulted in identification of additional putative PSMs from growth extracts of S. pneumonia S. gordonii Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus sobrinus which showed high homology to hymenamide H mz 903.52 callyaerin H mz 1043.62 axinastatin 4 mz 806.47 gramicidin S2 mz 1126.69 phakellistatin11 mz 973.51 janthinocin A mz 1192.61 micropeptin C mz 1027.49 and Sch 378167 5511-diamide mz 1135.66 as shown on the GNPS site at .In conclusion by using a comparative analysis approach based on the annotation of parent masses in growth cultures of individual oral bacterial isolates in parallel with the highly complex in vitro biofilm community we identified unique signatures of PSMs over time which suggests that the oral microbiome has a highly dynamic chemotype that is potentially involved in the regulation of community succession and bacterium- to-bacterium interactions as well as cell-to-host signaling.

Here we report on the temporal production and overall chemodiversity of the PSM secretome of human oral cavity-associated bacterial isolates belonging to the Actinomyces Fusobacterium Lactobacillus Porphyromonas Streptococ- cus and Veillonella genera as well as an in vitro oral biofilm model system containing more than 100 bacterial species  .

Other studies identified that they are capable of inter- acting with other bacterial community members at the level of gene transcription as well as regulating bacterial population sizes and survival  .FIG 4 Venn diagrams showing unique and shared molecular masses produced at different growth stages of in vitro biofilms Bio and 14 of the total 27 studied bacterial isolates.

Furthermore these annotation approaches also provided a survey of the biosynthetic capacity of common oral bacterial community members and a method to compare isolates based on the variety of their SMs.MATERIALS AND METHODSDescription of growth media bacterial strains and saliva inoculum.

Through comparative analysis of mass spectral profiles from a collection of cultured oral isolates and an established in vitro multispecies oral community we found that the production of SMs both delineates a temporal expression pattern and allows discrimination between bacterial isolates at the spe- cies level.

In this study we assessed secreted peptidic SMs PSMs from 27 oral bacterial isolates and a complex oral in vitro biofilm community of 100 species by using the Global Natural Products Social molecular Networking and the DEREPLICATOR infrastructures which are methodologies that allow automated and putative annota-JulyAugust 2017 Volume 2 Issue 4 e00058-17msystems.asm.org 1tion of PSMs.

Other interesting putative PSMs produced both by bacterial isolates and the in vitro biofilm community were platelet activating factor PAF C-16 mz 524.368 to 524.378 and lyso-PAF mz 482.362 to 482.362-like compounds  see Table S1 posted at the above URL.

Each human mouth harbors a unique bacterial diversity consisting of on average approximately 150 bacterial taxa  and in addition to this complexity within each of these exclusive communities all primary types of organism interaction can exist i.e.

Here we expand on our knowledge of the in vitro biofilm community to include PSMs which are well-known bioactive compounds that play key roles in cell-to-cell signaling and interactions with a host .By employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MSMS on cell-free bacterial growth medium extracts using the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking GNPS  and the DEREPLICATOR  infrastructures we putatively identified a large number of PSMs secreted from the in vitro biofilm com- munity as well as from individual bacterial isolates.
