This resulted in identification of additional putative PSMs from growth extracts of S. pneumonia S. gordonii Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus sobrinus which showed high homology to hymenamide H mz 903.52 callyaerin H mz 1043.62 axinastatin 4 mz 806.47 gramicidin S2 mz 1126.69 phakellistatin11 mz 973.51 janthinocin A mz 1192.61 micropeptin C mz 1027.49 and Sch 378167 5511-diamide mz 1135.66 as shown on the GNPS site at .In conclusion by using a comparative analysis approach based on the annotation of parent masses in growth cultures of individual oral bacterial isolates in parallel with the highly complex in vitro biofilm community we identified unique signatures of PSMs over time which suggests that the oral microbiome has a highly dynamic chemotype that is potentially involved in the regulation of community succession and bacterium- to-bacterium interactions as well as cell-to-host signaling.

Here we report on the temporal production and overall chemodiversity of the PSM secretome of human oral cavity-associated bacterial isolates belonging to the Actinomyces Fusobacterium Lactobacillus Porphyromonas Streptococ- cus and Veillonella genera as well as an in vitro oral biofilm model system containing more than 100 bacterial species  .

Furthermore these annotation approaches also provided a survey of the biosynthetic capacity of common oral bacterial community members and a method to compare isolates based on the variety of their SMs.MATERIALS AND METHODSDescription of growth media bacterial strains and saliva inoculum.

A saliva inoculum for in vitro biofilm growth was collected and pooled from six healthy subjects ages 25 to 35 years as described by Edlund and colleagues .Incubation conditions for oral bacterial isolates and saliva-derived in vitro biofilms.

Through comparative analysis of mass spectral profiles from a collection of cultured oral isolates and an established in vitro multispecies oral community we found that the production of SMs both delineates a temporal expression pattern and allows discrimination between bacterial isolates at the spe- cies level.
