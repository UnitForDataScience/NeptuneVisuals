The mode of action linked with the effect EA and UROs exert on a panel of malignant cell lines includes the induction of CDKN1A gene which blocks the cell cycle and conse- quently inhibits cell growth Gonzalez-Sarrias et al..

All the other chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical or cell culture grade and used without further purification.Cell cultureThe human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC Rockville MD USA.

They have been linked to modulation of the multiple cellular processes that moderate the homeostasis between cell survival and cell death Surh  Jafari et al.

.It is a known fact that reactive oxygen species playa significant role in carcinogenesis by damaging DNA and promoting mutagenesis lipid and protein oxida- tion and modulation of cell signalling Perse .

Trypan blue dye exclusion test was used to assess the cell viability before immedi- ate stimulation experiments Strober .Determination of intracellular reactive oxygen speciesThe level of intracellular reactive oxygen species was assessed by measuring the oxidation of the probe 2070-dichlorofluorescin diacetate DCFH-DA Molecular Probes Life Sciences Eugene OR USA according to the method of Cathcart et al.

Correlation between different parameters was per- formed at significance level of p S .05.Results and discussionEffects of URO on cell growthMultifactorial aetiology of cancer can include diet environmental andor genetic influences.

Deleterious effects of ROSRNS exert includei DNA damage ii alteration in cell signalling pathways PLA ASK 1 MAPK AP-1 NFjB andiii modulation of gene expression proto-oncogene tumour suppressor gene.

Cytotoxic effect of UROs on cells was measured by assessing the leakage of LDH into cell culture supernatant.

Previous reports have found that EA inhibits growth of colon cancer cell at concentrations below 100 lM Seeram et al.
