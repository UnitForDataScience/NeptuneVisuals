The mode of action linked with the effect EA and UROs exert on a panel of malignant cell lines includes the induction of CDKN1A gene which blocks the cell cycle and conse- quently inhibits cell growth Gonzalez-Sarrias et al..

Furthermore URO A and its isomer IsoURO A have been linked with cell cycle arrest in Caco-2 cells at S and G2M phase and induction of apoptosis Gonzalez-Sarrias et al.
