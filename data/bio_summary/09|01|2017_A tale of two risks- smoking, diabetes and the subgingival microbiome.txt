on the other hand diabetics with periodontitis dis- played two robust microbial hubs with several inter- generic networks one that consisted of uncultivated phylotypes belonging to tm7 treponema micro- bacterium and sphingomonas and the other com- prising fretibacterium and peptostreptococcaceaexi g4 and xii g5 and filifactor alocis.to examine the ecological shifts from health to disease in hyperglycemics the microbiomes of diabetics with and without periodontitis were ana- lyzed and compared to periodontally healthyfigure 1 similarity in microbial community configuration between deep and shallow sites.

smoking and diabetes are the only known risk factors for this disease increasing the extent and severity of period- ontitis by 3-10-fold and hastening periodontal destruction exponentially correspondence ps kumar division of periodontology college of dentistry the ohio state university 4111 postle hall 305 w 12th avenue columbus oh 43210 usa.e-mail received 20 october 2016 revised 6 march 2017 accepted22 march 2017 published online 23 may 2017 periodontitis has been called the sixth complication of diabetes with one-third of diabetics suffering from severe periodontitis .

also only 42 species formed the core microbiome of periodontitis in diabetics and seven of these were notdetected in normoglycemics with periodontitis.

the present investigation analyzed 2.7 million 16s sequences from 175 non-smoking normoglycemic individuals controls smokers diabetics and diabetic smokers with periodontitis as well as periodontally healthy controls smokers and diabetics to assess subgingival bacterial biodiversity and co-occurrence patterns.

nearly 42 of periodontitis cases can be attributed to smoking  and critically 24 of diabetics smoke  thus creating three high-risk groups for periodontal diseases smokers diabetics and diabetic smokers.

periodontally healthy diabetics exhibited signifi- cantly lower species richness than both diabetics with periodontitis and periodontally healthy controls p  0.0019 6b.

in addition 30 species were identifiedonly in the core microbiome of periodontally healthy diabetics however none of these were detectable in diabetics with periodontitis 3b.

the core microbiome of periodontitis in smokers was larger than that of diabetics 22 of s-otus in smokers and 17 in diabetics .

co-occurrence was sparse and congeneric in smo- kers and robust inter-generic microbial hubs were seen in diabetics fi5.to compare the ecological shift from health to disease between smokers and diabetics the micro- biomes of smokers with and without periodontitis were analyzed and compared to periodontally healthy nonsmokers controls.

with nearly30 million americans suffering from adult-onset diabetes and over 1 billion smokers worldwide  preventing periodontitis in these high-risk populations will be a highly cost effective healthcare strategy.although it is established that dysbiosis of the indigenous periodontal microbiome is the primary etiological trigger for periodontitis the events that lead to this dysbiosis are not well understood.

these microbiomes exhibited significant clustering based on hba1c levels pre-diabetic o6.5 diabetic 6.5-9.9 diabetics 410. smokers with periodontitis evidenced a robust core microbiome species identified in at least 80 of individuals dominated by anaerobes with inter-individual differences attributable largely to the 'rare biosphere'.

in diabetics this environment is glucose-rich pro-oxidant protein-rich and anaerobic.the effects of smoking on the oral microbiome have been extensively studied in recent years and several investigations have established that the oral microbiome shifts in response to this environmental press   smoking creates pathogen-rich commensal- poor microbial ecosystems even in clinically healthy individuals that closely resemble disease- associated communities  although it is known that uncontrolled hyperglycemia similarly increases the risk for periodontitis very few studies have exam- ined the effects of diabetes on the subgingival microbiome  furthermore there are no studies that examine the effects of intersecting environmental presses on periodontal microbiota.hence the goal of the present investigation was to examine the effects of each environmental press on the structure and membership of the subgingival microbial communities using an open-ended deep sequencing approach.

thus in a subject with disease differences in community structure or membership were not apparent based on severity of periodontal destruction.distinct subgingival microbial assemblages are associated with uncontrolled chronic hyperglycemia 75 of the microbiome of type 2 diabetics with periodontitis was composed of gram-positive facul- tatives and gram-negative anaerobes .

when the data were analyzed at the level of the core species further differences between periodontal health and periodontitis in diabetics could be observed 3b.

however unlike diabetics smokers with periodontitis shared 86 of their microbiome with periodontally healthy smokers.in summary while certain community trends low inventory diversity periodontitis-associated signa- tures in periodontal health were similar between smoking and diabetes these communities demon- strated significant differences based on the environ- mental perturbation.
