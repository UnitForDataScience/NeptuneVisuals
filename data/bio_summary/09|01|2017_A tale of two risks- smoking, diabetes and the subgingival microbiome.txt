On the other hand diabetics with periodontitis dis- played two robust microbial hubs with several inter- generic networks one that consisted of uncultivated phylotypes belonging to TM7 Treponema Micro- bacterium and Sphingomonas and the other com- prising Fretibacterium and PeptostreptococcaceaeXI G4 and XII G5 and Filifactor alocis.To examine the ecological shifts from health to disease in hyperglycemics the microbiomes of diabetics with and without periodontitis were ana- lyzed and compared to periodontally healthyFigure 1 Similarity in microbial community configuration between deep and shallow sites.

Also only 42 species formed the core microbiome of periodontitis in diabetics and seven of these were notdetected in normoglycemics with periodontitis.

The present investigation analyzed 2.7 million 16S sequences from 175 non-smoking normoglycemic individuals controls smokers diabetics and diabetic smokers with periodontitis as well as periodontally healthy controls smokers and diabetics to assess subgingival bacterial biodiversity and co-occurrence patterns.

Nearly 42 of periodontitis cases can be attributed to smoking  and critically 24 of diabetics smoke  thus creating three high-risk groups for periodontal diseases smokers diabetics and diabetic smokers.

Periodontally healthy diabetics exhibited signifi- cantly lower species richness than both diabetics with periodontitis and periodontally healthy controls P  0.0019 6b.

In addition 30 species were identifiedonly in the core microbiome of periodontally healthy diabetics however none of these were detectable in diabetics with periodontitis 3b.

The core microbiome of periodontitis in smokers was larger than that of diabetics 22 of s-OTUs in smokers and 17 in diabetics .

Co-occurrence was sparse and congeneric in smo- kers and robust inter-generic microbial hubs were seen in diabetics Fi5.To compare the ecological shift from health to disease between smokers and diabetics the micro- biomes of smokers with and without periodontitis were analyzed and compared to periodontally healthy nonsmokers controls.

With nearly30 million Americans suffering from adult-onset diabetes and over 1 billion smokers worldwide  preventing periodontitis in these high-risk populations will be a highly cost effective healthcare strategy.Although it is established that dysbiosis of the indigenous periodontal microbiome is the primary etiological trigger for periodontitis the events that lead to this dysbiosis are not well understood.
