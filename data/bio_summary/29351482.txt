endothelium-independent dilation was not altered by diet orantibiotic treatment figure 3e and 3f.body weight as well as epididymal and subcutaneous fat masses were significantly increased bywd and unaffected by antibiotic treatment figure 4a-c. plasma leptin and insulin levels were alsoelevated in wd and not significantly decreased by antibiotic treatment figure 4d-e. likewise wdsignificantly impaired glucose tolerance with no effect of antibiotic treatment figure 4f.to begin to explore potential mechanisms by which suppression of gut dysbiosis reversed vasculardysfunction we assessed plasma levels lps-binding protein lbp and soluble cluster ofdifferentiation-14 scd14 two markers of lps signaling associated with cardiovascular outcomes 35.lbp figure 5a and the lbpscd-14 ratio figure 5b were increased in wd and significantly reducedin wdabx.

arterial stiffness was serially 601measured by in vivo aortic pulse wave velocity apwv a. antibiotic treatment in a subset of wd mice 602was initiated following 5 months of wd feeding as indicated.

we found that antibiotic treatment reduced circulating levels of il-6 and mcp-1 and vascularphosphorylation of nf-kb all of which are regulated by lps and are established mediators of vasculardysfunction 59. in addition nf-kb activation can suppress the expression of endothelial nitric oxidesynthase enos a key enzyme that regulates vascular homeostasis through the production of thevasodilatory and anti-inflammatory molecule nitric oxide no 38. although enos expression orphosphorylation was not directly measured in the current study our finding that dilation following l-name inhibition a measure of no-dependent dilation was reduced by wd feeding and restored withantibiotic treatment suggests that altered no bioavailability may have contributed to the observeddifferences in vascular function.

antibiotic treatment successfully abrogated the gut microbiota and reversed wd-induced arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.

l-name-inhibited dilation was reduced in wd mice and restoredwith antibiotic treatment figure 3d.

phosphorylation of nf-kb which also occurs downstream of lps signaling wassignificantly increased in the aorta of wd mice and normalized following antibiotic treatment figure6a.

interestingly we found that pvat expression ofconstitutively active nox4 was not altered by wd feeding or antibiotic treatment.

previous research has not observed an effectof antibiotic treatment in control low-fat diet-fed mice on markers of endotoxemia or metabolicparameters 8 11. given that sd-fed mice displayed normal vascular function we did not anticipatethat inclusion of a sd  abx group would provide any significant insight regarding the role of gutdysbiosis in mediating vascular dysfunction.
