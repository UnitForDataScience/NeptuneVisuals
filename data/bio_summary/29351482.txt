These results extend recent data linking gutdysbiosis to the development of other cardiovascular abnormalities including atherosclerosis andhypertension 60 and lend further support to the notion that the gut microbiota represents a futuretherapeutic target for cardiovascular disease 30.In the first study to examine a link between vascular function and gut dysbiosis Vikram et al.elegantly demonstrated using microbiota transplantations and antibiotic treatment that gut dysbiosiscan induce endothelial function via upregulation of vascular miR-204 and subsequent downregulation ofSirt1 Vikram et al.

L-609NAME-inhibited dilation a measure of NO-dependent dilation was calculated as the percent reduction 610in maximal EDD in the absence vs presence of L-NAME D. Endothelium-dependent dilation EID to 611sodium nitroprusside SNP E-F. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated-measures612ANOVA EDD and EID dose responses and one-way ANOVA all other outcomes.

These results indicate that gut dysbiosis contributes to the development of WD-inducedvascular dysfunction and identify the gut microbiota as a novel therapeutic target for obesity-relatedvascular abnormalities.41Abbreviations CVDCardiovascular disease aPWVaortic pulse wave velocity SDstandard dietWDWestern diet Abxantibiotics PVAT perivascular adipose tissue LPSlipopolysaccharideLBPLPS-binding protein CD14cluster of differentiation 14 AGEs advanced glycation end productsEDDendothelium-dependent dilation EID endothelium-independent dilation NO nitric oxide2IntroductionIntestinal microbes have emerged as critical regulators of human physiology 26.

Cycling conditions using the Biorad CFX96 thermalcycler were as follows 95degC for 3min and then 40 cycles of 95degC 15s 61degC 15s 72degC 10s 85degC 5sfollowed by florescence detection.Paired-end sequencing libraries were constructed by following the Illumina 16s protocol which includesamplification of the V3-V4 regions of the 16s rRNA gene purification of amplicons using AmPure6beads ligation with Illumina adaptors and dual indices followed by another round of AmPure beadpurification quantification denaturation and library pooling and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq.Paired fastq files were assembled and processed using the default myPhyloDB ver.

Due to well-establisheddifficulties obtaining reliable circulating LPS levels as well as limitations of commercially availablechromogenic assays 4 47 LPS signaling was determined by circulating levels of LBP and solubleCD14 two commonly used surrogates for LPS.

Suppression of the gut microbiota with antibiotics has been used in numerous animalmodels to establish a causal role of the gut microbiota in disease risk or progression 11 37 52 61.For example antibiotics were used to establish an obligate role of the gut microbiota in the productionof the pro-atherogenic compound trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO 65.Although antibiotics have been widely used as an experimental tool to examine the effects ofmicrobiota suppression on host physiology the approach is not without limitations.

Linear regression using Pearson's correlation andsparse Partial Least Square Regression analysis sPLS were used to identify relationships betweenspecific bacterial taxa and metavariables related to inflammation and vascular function outcomes.ResultsWe first confirmed that antibiotic administration successfully abrogated intestinal microbes by qPCRusing universal primers for the 16s ribosomal subunit.
