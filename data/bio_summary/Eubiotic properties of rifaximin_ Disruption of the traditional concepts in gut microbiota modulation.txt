The incidence of infections was low too and the few cases of C. difficile colitis reported during rifaximin treatment were generally associated with predisposing conditions such as hospitalization and prolonged antibiotic use.Therefore rifaximin eubiotic properties are asso- ciated with a good safety and tolerability profile which makes possible a wide use of this molecule in different clinical settings.EUBIOSIS A NEW-OLD CONCEPTabruptly disappear after treatment interruption lasting in the short time period further studies are needed to investigate if the positive modulation of the gut microbiota produced by rifaximin could persist over time.RIFAXIMIN AS EUBIOTIC AGENT IN CLINICAL PRACTICEIn addition to the favorable modulation of the gut microbiota rifaximin presents other features that make its use safely applicable in clinical practice.Rifaximin is poorly absorbed and a negligible concentration is retrieved in urine after oral ad- ministration.

Indeed changes in the colonic gut microbiota composition are progressively but completely reversed after rifaximin interruption differently from the effects on duodenal bacteria that appear more stable66.Indeed rifaximin administration at the same dose of 1800 mg daily did not alter the overall composition of the gut microbiota but promoted the growth of Bifidobacterium Atopobium and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.More recently Xu et al79 demonstrated that Lactobacilli could grow in response to rifaximin administration.

This has opened the scenario to the new concept of antibiotic-related gut microbiota modulation which overcomes the traditional bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects and involves the possibility of more complex interactions resulting in a modulation of the gut flora favorable to the host.In this paper we will focus on the effects of antibiotics and in particular rifaximin on gut bacteria discussing both its traditional and non-traditional properties and defining the new concept of eubiotic modulation of the gut microbiota.ANTIBIOTICS AND GUT MICROBIOTApathogens5556.

In particular rifaximin can down-regulate the inflammatory response triggered by the gut microbes by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor NF-kB via the pregnane X receptor PXR and by reducing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin IL-1B and tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNFa67-71.Moreover rifaximin alters bacterial virulence through the inhibition of adhesion internalization and translocation72-75 and can modify bacterial meta- bolism76.Rifaximin modulation of gut microbial compositionFigure 1 Effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota.

The most frequent ones have been headache nausea dizziness dyspepsia abdominal discomfort abdominal distention diarrhea constipationThe increase in bacteria beneficial to the gut associated with rifaximin treatment together with its additional properties and its local action reasonably support a reclassification of this molecule which can be defined not only as an antibiotic but also as an eubiotic namely a positive modulator of the gut ecosystem.Usually humans live in a commensal and mutualistic symbiotic relationship with their own gut microbiota which is a prolonged and close association resulting in a benefit for one or both the organisms94.However the term symbiosis does not com- pletely describe the exact nature of this cooperation failing to depict the dynamism that is the culprit of this relationship.

Lactobacillus abundance was increased at the end of treatment with rifaximin and 1 mo thereafter while no modification of the overall composition of the gut microbiota was observed even stratifying patients according to treatment timepoints and considering the original disease.In conclusion rifaximin is able to increase the abundance of beneficial intestinal bacteria whilekeeping stable the overall composition of the gut microbial community.

This peculiar characteristic may differentiate rifaximin from the other systemic antibiotics.RIFAXIMIN A POORLY ABSORBED ANTIBIOTIC WITH NON-TRADITIONAL EFFECTS ON GUT BACTERIAalso belongs to the non-traditional features of this poorly absorbed antibiotic.EUBIOTIC EFFECTS OF RIFAXIMIN ON THE GUT MICROBIOTAIn addition to the aforementioned activity against bacterial adherence internalization and translocation and to the anti-inflammatory effects there is evidence of a positive modulation of the gut microbiota as a consequence of rifaximin treatment Table 1.The pioneering study that demonstrated for the first time the increase in beneficial bacterial strains associated with rifaximin intake was conducted more than ten years ago on twelve patients affected by ulcerative colitis77.

Rifaximin eubiotic effects on gut microbiotathese clinical settings the beneficial modulation of the gut microbiota produced by rifaximin together with its other non-traditional effects result in a beneficial anti- inflammatory and trophic action on the intestine.CONCLUSIONThe symbiotic host-gut microbiota relationship is a condition of relational harmony fluctuating between eubiosis and dysbiosis.
