as the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining humans' health less or more specific gut microbiota alterations have been associated with various gastrointestinal diseases6-20.

these findings strongly support the use of gut microbiota modulators such as antibiotics prebiotics and probiotics as the treatment of choice in almost all gastrointestinal disorders.in addition to the speculative and intriguing value of these physiopathological findings it is also interesting to address which modifications of the gut microbiota may occur after a therapeutic intervention such as antibiotic treatment.

all these modifications are highly variable among individuals and the consequences of antibiotics-associated gut microbiota perturbation in humans remain unknown.morgun et al59 analyzed metagenomic andmetatranscriptomic changes in a mouse model of microbiota depletion after the administration of an antibiotic cocktail ampicillin vancomycin neomycin and metronidazole.

indeed changes in the colonic gut microbiota composition are progressively but completely reversed after rifaximin interruption differently from the effects on duodenal bacteria that appear more stable66.indeed rifaximin administration at the same dose of 1800 mg daily did not alter the overall composition of the gut microbiota but promoted the growth of bifidobacterium atopobium and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.more recently xu et al79 demonstrated that lactobacilli could grow in response to rifaximin administration.

the incidence of infections was low too and the few cases of c. difficile colitis reported during rifaximin treatment were generally associated with predisposing conditions such as hospitalization and prolonged antibiotic use.therefore rifaximin eubiotic properties are asso- ciated with a good safety and tolerability profile which makes possible a wide use of this molecule in different clinical settings.eubiosis a new-old conceptabruptly disappear after treatment interruption lasting in the short time period further studies are needed to investigate if the positive modulation of the gut microbiota produced by rifaximin could persist over time.rifaximin as eubiotic agent in clinical practicein addition to the favorable modulation of the gut microbiota rifaximin presents other features that make its use safely applicable in clinical practice.rifaximin is poorly absorbed and a negligible concentration is retrieved in urine after oral ad- ministration.

rifaximin eubiotic effects on gut microbiotathese clinical settings the beneficial modulation of the gut microbiota produced by rifaximin together with its other non-traditional effects result in a beneficial anti- inflammatory and trophic action on the intestine.conclusionthe symbiotic host-gut microbiota relationship is a condition of relational harmony fluctuating between eubiosis and dysbiosis.

the poorly absorbed antibiotic rifaximin seem to be different from the other antibiotics because it exerts non-traditional effects additional to the bactericidalbacteriostatic activity on the gut microbiota.

animal models culture studies and metagenomic analyses have demonstrated an increase in bifidobacterium  faecalibacterium prausnitzii and lactobacillus abundance after rifaximin treatment probably consequent to the induction of bacterial resistance with no major change in the overall gut microbiota composition.

antibiotics are therefore modulators of the symbiotic relationship between the host and the gut microbiota.
