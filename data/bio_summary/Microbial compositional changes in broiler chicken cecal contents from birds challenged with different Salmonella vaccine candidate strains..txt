individual sample was represented as spot with red group 1 unvacinnated blue group 2 vaccinated with pbad-mvin s. typhimurium uk-1 orange group 3 vaccinated with wild type salmonella uk-1 and green group 4 vaccinated with ddmetrmetd s. typhimurium uk-1.

group 1 unvaccinated group 2 vaccinated with pbad-mvin s. typhimurium uk-1 group 3 vaccinated with wild type salmonella uk-1 group 4 vaccinated with ddmetrmetd s. typhimurium uk-1.most otus belonged to clostridiales with 95.19 from g1 93.30 from g2 87.89 from g3 and 96.12 from g4 of the total class.

group 4 samples vaccinated with ddmetrmetd s. typhimurium uk-1 exhibited greater observedotu and chao1 numbers compared to the other groups while g2 vaccinated with pbad-mvin s. typhimurium uk-1 yielded lower numbers a and b. the shannon diversity plot also yielded higher numbers in the g4 samples c. these results indicated that g4 birds are more diverse in their cecal pop- ulations than the other groups.unweighted principal coordinated analysis pcoa unifrac plot that was generated by the beta diversity analysis is shown in .

the birds in g2 to 4 were orally inoculated with pbad-mvin s. typhimurium uk-1 108 cfu 0.2 ml wild type s. typhimurium uk-1 108 cfu0.2 ml and ddmetrmetd s. typhimurium uk-1 108 cfu0.2 ml via a sterile gavage needle on day 2 post-hatch and re- inoculated on day 7 post-hatch respectively.

the cecal microbial community obtained from unvaccinated group 1 and vaccinated chickens group 2 vaccinated with pbad-mvin group 3 vaccinated with wild type group 4 vaccinated with ddmetrmetd were subjected to micro- biome sequencing analysis with an illumina miseq platform.

a total of 45 chicks were utilized in the previous study and each bird was distributed into 4 groups g1 15 birds unvaccinated g2 10 birds vaccinated with pbad-mvin s. typhi- murium uk-1 g3 10 birds vaccinated with wild type s. typhi- murium uk-1 and g4 10 birds vaccinated with ddmetrmetds.

vaccine 35 2017 3204-32083205in the present study we compared bacterial compositional changes in ceca of unvaccinated and vaccinated chickens with a wild type salmonella uk-1 positive control and two mechanisti- cally distinct vaccine strains namely a methionine auxotrophic mutant ddmetrmetd recently constructed in our laboratory and a mutant strain pbad-mvin vaccine strain which was initially introduced in our previous research  using a next generation sequencing ngs to assess potential impact of the salmonella vac- cine strains on the cecal microbiota.materials and methodsbacterial strainsa wild type s. typhimurium uk-1 strain had previously been utilized to construct potential vaccine strains and a nalidixic acid na resistant s. typhimurium uk-1 derived from the wild type was used as the challenge strain.

group 3 exhibited a lower percentage of firmicutes than other groups while they yielded higher abundance levels of bacteroidetes 3.21 of g3 vs. 0.01 to 0.04 of other groups and verrucomicrobia compared to other groups.at the taxonomic class level bacteria with the highest proportion was clostridia in all groups data not shown.

group 3 yielded a lower proportion of clostridiales than the other groups while it exhibited a higher abundance of bacteroidales 3.21 in g3 vs. 0.01 to 0.04 in other groups and verrucomicro- biales 2.49 in g3 versus 0.25 to 1.73 in other groups.at the family level samples were dominated by ruminococcaceae clostridiales order level lachnospiraceae erysipelotrichaceae and lactobacillaceae accounting for 37.17 29.50 24.39 1.26 and 1.51 average value from total samples data not shown.

instead higher proportions of ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae were observed in g2 39.43 and 27.91 respectively and g3 40.10 and 24.91 than g1 34.84 and 22.99 and g4 34.31 and 21.73. the relative abundance of verrucomicrobiaceae was higher in g3 2.49 and 4 1.73 as compared to g1 0.25 and g2 1.73at the genus level clostridiales order level ruminococcus taxonomical proposed but not confirmed ruminococcaceae fam- ily level oscillospira and ruminococcus were the dominant bacte- rial groups with 29.50 13.84 16.77 9.69 and 6.11 respectively b. similar to the family level results the abundance of clostridiales order level was significantly higher in g4 37.61 compared to g3 21.26. a significantly higher proportion of oscillospira was also exhibited in g1 11.62 compared to g2 6.77. the ruminococcus genus is one of the most predominant bacterial groups found in the gastrointestinal tracts of chickens and turkeys and the relative abundance of ruminococcus in each treatment group was not affected by salmonella vaccine strains.

firmicutes were the most predominant bacteria accounting for 98.20 g1 unvaccinated 97.18 g2 vaccinated with pbad-mvin 91.90 g3 vaccinated with wild type and 97.55 g4 vaccinated with ddmetrmetd.

the ngs microbiome analysis of chicken ceca revealed considerable changes in microbial composition in the presence of the different vaccine strains and exhibited detectable patterns of distinctive clustering among the respective groups the r value of unweighted pcoa plot was 0.68. the present study indicates that different s. typhimurium vac- cine strains can differentially influence the microbiota of the ceca in terms of presence but not in the rel- ative abundance of microbiota.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionmicrobiological safety of food has become a global public health issue to both the consumers and the food industry.
