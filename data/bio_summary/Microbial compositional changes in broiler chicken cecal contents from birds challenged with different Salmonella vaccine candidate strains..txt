Vaccine 35 2017 3204-32083205In the present study we compared bacterial compositional changes in ceca of unvaccinated and vaccinated chickens with a wild type Salmonella UK-1 positive control and two mechanisti- cally distinct vaccine strains namely a methionine auxotrophic mutant DDmetRmetD recently constructed in our laboratory and a mutant strain PBAD-mviN vaccine strain which was initially introduced in our previous research  using a next generation sequencing NGS to assess potential impact of the Salmonella vac- cine strains on the cecal microbiota.Materials and methodsBacterial strainsA wild type S. Typhimurium UK-1 strain had previously been utilized to construct potential vaccine strains and a nalidixic acid NA resistant S. Typhimurium UK-1 derived from the wild type was used as the challenge strain.

Individual sample was represented as spot with red Group 1 unvacinnated blue Group 2 vaccinated with PBAD-mviN S. Typhimurium UK-1 orange Group 3 vaccinated with wild type Salmonella UK-1 and green Group 4 vaccinated with DDmetRmetD S. Typhimurium UK-1.

Group 4 samples vaccinated with DDmetRmetD S. Typhimurium UK-1 exhibited greater observedOTU and Chao1 numbers compared to the other groups while G2 vaccinated with PBAD-mviN S. Typhimurium UK-1 yielded lower numbers A and B.

Group 1 unvaccinated Group 2 vaccinated with PBAD-mviN S. Typhimurium UK-1 Group 3 vaccinated with wild type Salmonella UK-1 Group 4 vaccinated with DDmetRmetD S. Typhimurium UK-1.Most OTUs belonged to Clostridiales with 95.19 from G1 93.30 from G2 87.89 from G3 and 96.12 from G4 of the total class.

The birds in G2 to 4 were orally inoculated with PBAD-mviN S. Typhimurium UK-1 108 CFU 0.2 ml wild type S. Typhimurium UK-1 108 CFU0.2 ml and DDmetRmetD S. Typhimurium UK-1 108 CFU0.2 ml via a sterile gavage needle on day 2 post-hatch and re- inoculated on day 7 post-hatch respectively.

A total of 45 chicks were utilized in the previous study and each bird was distributed into 4 groups G1 15 birds unvaccinated G2 10 birds vaccinated with PBAD-mviN S. Typhi- murium UK-1 G3 10 birds vaccinated with wild type S. Typhi- murium UK-1 and G4 10 birds vaccinated with DDmetRmetDS.

The cecal microbial community obtained from unvaccinated group 1 and vaccinated chickens group 2 vaccinated with PBAD-mviN group 3 vaccinated with wild type group 4 vaccinated with DDmetRmetD were subjected to micro- biome sequencing analysis with an Illumina MiSeq platform.

Firmicutes were the most predominant bacteria accounting for 98.20 G1 unvaccinated 97.18 G2 vaccinated with PBAD-mviN 91.90 G3 vaccinated with wild type and 97.55 G4 vaccinated with DDmetRmetD.

Group 3 exhibited a lower percentage of Firmicutes than other groups while they yielded higher abundance levels of Bacteroidetes 3.21 of G3 vs. 0.01 to 0.04 of other groups and Verrucomicrobia compared to other groups.At the taxonomic class level bacteria with the highest proportion was Clostridia in all groups data not shown.
