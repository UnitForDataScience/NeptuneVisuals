since the maximum microbial removal observed in ec trials was already attained at 20e60 min the sequential treatment was per- formed by selecting a duration of 30 min for the initial ec stepwhich was performed with 200 ml samples using a stirred fefe cell at j 200 a m-2.

after30 min of treatment the heterotrophic bacteria concentration diminished 4.12 log units in the primary effluent and 3.20 log unitsfig.

these values differ from those reported by  who described a very high toc abatement of about 90 for a secondary treatment of urban wastewater with conven- tional activated sludge although they reached a very weak disap- pearance 1.5e2.4 log units of bacterial indicators.a and b illustrates the decay of bacteria concentration atdifferent times of the sequential treatment in both wastewater samples.

somatic coliphages were the less persistent organisms being un- detectable after 20 min in both matrices followed by the eukary- otes whose content decreased substantially at that time with total disappearance at 60 min.

60 min whereas heterotrophic bacteria enterococci and spores were more resistant.

in contrast the concentration of hetero- trophic bacteria decayed to 103 cfu ml-1 in 90 min corre- sponding to a reduction of 3.66 and 2.81 log units for the primary and secondary effluents respectively.

s1 reveals a quick removal of such bacteria in both matrices during the first 10 min of ec followed by a slower concentration decay until the end of the electrolysis.

after 30 min of ef for example the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria was below 10 cfu ml-1 with decays of 3.62 and 3.97 log units for the primary and secondary effluent respectively.

in contrast most of the eukaryote bacteria persisted until 5e10 min for the primary one.

s4 reveals a fast inactivation of hetero- trophic bacteria during the 30 min of the ef step despite the slight concentration increase upon ph adjustment to 7 after the ec step.

all the active microbiota except the heterotrophic bacteria were inactivated within 30 min of ef including the spores.

a sequential ecef treatment 30 min each was more effective for a combined decontamination and disinfection of urban wastewater.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionwastewater disposal through direct discharge into the aquatic environment entails potential risks for humans animals and eco- systems due to the presence of chemical and microbiological con- taminants.
