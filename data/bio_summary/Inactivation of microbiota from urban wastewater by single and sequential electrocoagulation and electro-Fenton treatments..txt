TOC removed and residual upon different treatments EC of 200 mL of primary and secondary effluents at j 14 200 A m-2 for 90 min electro-Fenton EF of 100 mL of the same wastewater samples at pH 3.0 and pH7 using an undivided BDDair- diffusion cell electrodes with 3 cm2 area at j 14 333 A m-2 and 25 oC for 30 min two-step ECEF processes for 30 min each.anode has been reported as well.

Since the maximum microbial removal observed in EC trials was already attained at 20e60 min the sequential treatment was per- formed by selecting a duration of 30 min for the initial EC stepwhich was performed with 200 mL samples using a stirred FeFe cell at j 200 A m-2.

The subsequent EF treatment of 100 mL of the supernatant liquid which already contained soluble iron ions formed in EC usually 3 mg L-1  was performed for 30 min as well using a stirred BDDair-diffusion tank reactor at j 333 A m-2.

The sequential application of EC and EF steps for 30 min each was the best treatment for the disinfection of urban wastewater.

Somatic coliphages were the less persistent organisms being un- detectable after 20 min in both matrices followed by the eukary- otes whose content decreased substantially at that time with total disappearance at 60 min.

A sequential ECEF treatment 30 min each was more effective for a combined decontamination and disinfection of urban wastewater.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Fe and BDD electrodes were immersed in Milli-Q water at 100 oC for 10 min and dried under an air stream.

The microor- ganism content is given as the mean value from two independent trials and the graphs also show the error bars that account for a 95 confidence interval.Results and discussionElectrocoagulationThe EC assays were performed with 200 mL of the primary and secondary effluents using a stirred FeFe tank reactor at j 200 A m-2 for 90 min.

At 20 min only amoebae could not be abated substantially in the latter effluent.Despite the large disappearance of all the microbiota understudy TOC content underwent a rather discrete removal for both kinds of wastewater upon EC treatment.

The assays were made with 100 mL of each effluent using a stirred BDDair-diffusion cell at j 333 A m-2 for 30 min.
