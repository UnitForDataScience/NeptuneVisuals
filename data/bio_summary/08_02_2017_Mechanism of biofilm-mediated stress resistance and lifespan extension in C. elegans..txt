Stained exopolysaccharides were detected only in the intestine of the worms fed with wild type B. subtilis while in worms grown on DepsH we observed only minor intestinal staining due to the binding of WGA-FITC to worms' glycocalyx and possibly due to weak binding to the B. subtilis cell wall.To obtain independent visual support for biofilm formation in C. elegans we examined worms fed with biofilm-producing B. subtilis biofilm or its DepsH mutant by electron microscopy and found vegetative cells surrounded by a dense matrix only in animals fed on biofilm-producing B. subtilis Supplementary Fig.

right panel suggesting that beneficial effects of the B. subtilis biofilm were not specific to any particular bacterial genetic background.To address if the beneficial effect of biofilm is a unique property of B subtilis or is also a feature of other non-pathogenic bacteria we studied thermotolerance of C. elegans fed on another Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and its biofilm-deficient counterpart DspaCBA Fig.

Thus to investigate the effect of B. subtilis biofilm formation on C. elegans physiology we first examined thermotolerance of worms fed the undomesticated B. sub- tilis isolate NCBI3610 and its biofilm-deficient derivatives DepsH and DtasA each of which lacks a different extracellular matrix component exopolysaccharide and amyloid-like protein fibers respectively essential for biofilm formation .

The table shows a list of genes whose expression changed q-value 0.05 in C. elegans fed biofilm-forming B. subtilis NCBI3610 biofilm compared to biofilm-deficient B. subtilis DepsH at day 5 of adulthood validated by RT-PCR.

RT-PCR analysis of pha-4 expression in C. elegans eat-2 dashed bars and N2 empty bars fed biofilm-forming biofilm and biofilm deficient DepsH DtasA B. subtilis strains.

Taken together our data demonstrate that B. subtilis forms biofilms in the C. elegans intestine.To determine whether the observed beneficial effects of the biofilm require live metabolizing bacteria we treated plated bacteria with a mix of antibiotics to eliminate vegetative cells leaving previously-synthesized components of the biofilm intact see Supplementary Discussion.

To determine whether the protective effect of biofilm-forming bac- teria against lethal infection by pathogenic P. aeruginosa was due to their superior intestinal retention we compared gut colonization by wild-type and biofilm-deficient B. subtilis and found by either colonization or guillotine assays no significant difference in the number of cells of each B. subtilis strain in the gut lumen Supplementary Fig.

These results suggest that commensal biofilm-producing B. subtilis may not compete directly with pathogenic Pseudomonas in the C. elegans gut but rather mobilize host defense sys- tems against the pathogen.Biofilm formation by B. subtilis extends the C. elegans lifespan.
