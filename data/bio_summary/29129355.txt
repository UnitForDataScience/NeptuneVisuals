this result suggested that the genetics of the human host might also play some role or roles in the formation of enterotypes.discussionthe human gut microbiome is a very complex ecosystem that might be influenced by many factors such as diet host health status age gender heightweight geographic environment medi- cation and host genetic structure recent studies on the human microbiome have suggested that individuals can be classified into three distinct enterotypes representing a network of three distinct microbial community types with each one dominated by a particu- lar genus while consensus largely exists that these enterotypes are the result of long-term dietary behavior the concept itself has also been challenged since other studies have proposed the existence of microbial community gradients rather than distinct enterotypes hence the possibility of a microbiome-based classification of human individuals is still subject to debate.

the raw paired-end sequencing read duplications were removed with cus- tom script mapped to the human reference genome 1000 genomes project v37 using bwa v0.7.5a with default settings and then the human source sequencing reads were removed by sam- tools v0.1.19 thereafter the pure microbiome sequencing reads were assessed and filtered according to the base qual- ity q  20 p  80 using fastx-toolkit  .the high quality microbiome sequencing reads were assembled by the soapdenovo2 package v2.04 using the parameters avg ins  250 k  63 k  45 r  y m  3 and others as default set- tings per individual.

since some participants provided only partial samples high quality dna sam- ples were finally selected from 48 han 48 kzk and 96 uig for further processing in which two human blood dna samples were missing.human dna genotyping and processinghuman dna genotyping was performed on an illumina human omnizhonghua-8 snp array and the raw intensity data were ana- lyzed with genomestudio.

furthermore the median-joining mj haplotype network composed of all ns muta- tions from the identified snps for each gene was constructed using network v4.6  and the 3d structures of homologous proteins according to these 40 genes were extracted from the protein data bank pdb database   using blastp and exhibited using pymol software .statistical analysisthe significance of relative abundance distributions between different taxa or functional catalogues was measured by the mann-whitney u test for two groups and the kruskal-wallis test for more than two groups and all p values were adjusted by benjamini-hochberg bh correction which were all performed using r packages.

furthermore the human genome-wide association study also showed that the abundance of the gut microbiota was highly correlated with the genotype of a specific locus within the human genome although the responsible biolog- ical mechanism will need further evaluation in future studies.conclusionin summary considerable differentiations were identified between two enterotypes that were not only reflected in the taxo- nomic compositions but also in the composition of functional genes and genomic diversity patterns within microbial genomes.

quantitatively the vari-ance between the two enterotypes was 31.12 of the total variance at the genus level based on amova as shown in which demonstrated that differences in the bacterial community com- position between the two enterotypes were significantly higher than the differences observed among the three human populations.
