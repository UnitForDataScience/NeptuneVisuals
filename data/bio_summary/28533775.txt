In front of an infectious challenge neutrophils are recruited in large numbers to the infected tissues the hematopoietic system must rapidly respond to the demand of these cells by turning from the steady-state to an emergency granulopoiesis .The tissue macrophages activate the LRX family transcrip- tion factors during the ingestion of apoptotic neutrophils in steady-state granulopoiesis.

In this context transcription factor CEBP-a regulates steady- state granulopoiesis whereas CEBP-b is critical for triggeringemergency granulopoiesis in response to GM-CSF .

8507. doi The number of granulocytes is maintained by a regulated balance between granulopoiesis in the bone marrow and clearance and destruction in peripheral tissues.

Therefore factors affecting the normal granulopoiesis lead to alterations in innate defenses and reduce the resistance against infections.

In this study we give a description on recent advances regarding the molecular and cellular events that regulate steady-state and emergency granulopoiesis which are crucial processes for the generation of protective innate immune responses.

Particular attention will be given to emergency granulopoiesis alterations in immunosup- pression states caused by malnutrition and chemotherapy.

The role of microbiota in main- taining a steady-state granulopoiesis and the immunological mechanisms involved are also discussed.

The mechanisms for systemic immunomodulation by the microbiota provide a probable mechanism for immunobiotics activity demonstrating that translocated microbial prod- ucts benefit the host by enhancing systemic innate immune function.In this mini review we examine the interaction between microbiota and immune system and how this crosstalk affects the maintenance of a steady-state granulopoiesis that is crucial for the generation of protective innate immune responses.
