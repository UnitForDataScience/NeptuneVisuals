The TEER measurements were resumed and recorded hourly over 12 h. Since the initial TEER for each insert was different the effect on TEER over time was expressed as the change in TEER compared to the initial TEER for each insert using the following Equation 1Change in TEER   TEER current-TEERinitial100.1TEERinitialSurvival of F. prausnitzii in Anaerobic Cell Culture MediaThe three F. prausnitzii strains were incubated in M199 TEER medium to monitor their survival.

In contrast when 75 or 100 BHI were added to the apical side of Caco-2 cell monolayers the normalized TEER values were significantly lower compared to cells treated with 0 BHI across all time points p  0.05.The TEER of the Caco-2 cells treated with 50 BHI reached a plateau of approximately 300 cm2following the initial drop in TEER whereas those with cell culture medium had TEER values that plateaued at approximately 600 cm2.

Triplicates of the bacterial solutions were incubated at 37 C and the optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm OD600nm was recorded Implen OD600 DiluPhotometer with DC10 DiluCell cuvettes Total Lab Solutions Auckland New Zealand at 2-h intervals over 24 h.TEER and Viability of Caco-2 Cells Using a Combination of Cell and Bacterial Culture MediaThe effect of combining M199 TEER medium and BHI medium on the TEER and viability of Caco-2 cells was examined using the apical anaerobic co-culture model.

The apical compartment of Caco-2 cell monolayers were exposed to non-supplemented anaerobic M199 TEER medium 0 BHI or M199 TEER medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of anaerobic BHI medium 25 50 75 or 100 BHI.Viability mean - SEM n  20 of Caco-2 cells after 12 h incubation.

Viability of the Caco-2 cells was unchanged as a consequence of differing culture medium composition p  0.07. b Mean -SEM n  20 change in TEER as a percentage of initial TEER across Caco-2 cell monolayers over 12 h for each medium.

The Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with this combination of bacterial and cell culture medium had TEER values that were more comparable to those reported for human colon tissues 100 to 300 cm2 .Two F. prausnitzii Strains Grew in 50 Bacterial Medium When Co-Cultured with Caco-2 CellsBased on the results above the viability of the F. prausnitzii strains was tested using the anaerobic M199 TEER BHI ratio 11 which was referred to as 50 BHI.

The F. prausnitzii strains may be able to use riboflavinvitamin B2 one component of M199 for its extracellular electron transfer which may benefit growth at this oxic-anoxic interphase .Live F. prausnitzii Did Not Alter TEER across Caco-2 CellsTo determine whether live F. prausnitzii was able to improve TEER differentiated Caco-2 monolayers were co-cultured with the three F. prausnitzii strains A2-165 ATCC 27768 or HTF-F in the apical anaerobic co-culture model using 25 or 50 BHI as apical medium.

Therefore it was decided to supplement cell culture medium with a complex bacterial culture medium.Bacterial Medium Did Not Affect Caco-2 Viability but Reduced TEER at High ConcentrationsAs our previous experience indicated that bacterial medium can be detrimental to mammalian cells initially the effect of the bacterial medium on the Caco-2 cell monolayers was investigated.

Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with 50 BHI showed no difference in TEER to Caco-2 cells treated with 0 BHI across all time points.
