the teer measurements were resumed and recorded hourly over 12 h. since the initial teer for each insert was different the effect on teer over time was expressed as the change in teer compared to the initial teer for each insert using the following equation 1change in teer   teer current-teerinitial100.1teerinitialsurvival of f. prausnitzii in anaerobic cell culture mediathe three f. prausnitzii strains were incubated in m199 teer medium to monitor their survival.

in contrast when 75 or 100 bhi were added to the apical side of caco-2 cell monolayers the normalized teer values were significantly lower compared to cells treated with 0 bhi across all time points p  0.05.the teer of the caco-2 cells treated with 50 bhi reached a plateau of approximately 300 cm2following the initial drop in teer whereas those with cell culture medium had teer values that plateaued at approximately 600 cm2.

the interaction between the bacterial treatment and time was significant for both media figure  p  0.001. however there were no differences between the teer of caco-2 cells treated with either the 25 or 50 bhi medium or the three f. prausnitzii strains in the respective medium for each time point p  0.05.0-10-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90-100024681012time hours0-10-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90-100024681012time hoursbfigure 5. change in teer across caco-2 monolayers co-cultured with live f. prausnitzii using 25 and 50 bhi as apical medium.

therefore it was decided to supplement cell culture medium with a complex bacterial culture medium.bacterial medium did not affect caco-2 viability but reduced teer at high concentrationsas our previous experience indicated that bacterial medium can be detrimental to mammalian cells initially the effect of the bacterial medium on the caco-2 cell monolayers was investigated.

the caco-2 cell monolayers treated with this combination of bacterial and cell culture medium had teer values that were more comparable to those reported for human colon tissues 100 to 300 cm2 .two f. prausnitzii strains grew in 50 bacterial medium when co-cultured with caco-2 cellsbased on the results above the viability of the f. prausnitzii strains was tested using the anaerobic m199 teer bhi ratio 11 which was referred to as 50 bhi.
