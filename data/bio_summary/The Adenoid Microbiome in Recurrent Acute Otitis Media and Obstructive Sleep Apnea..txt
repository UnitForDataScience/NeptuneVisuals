Original Article The Adenoid Microbiome in Recurrent Acute Otitis Media and Obstructive Sleep ApneaCarolyn O. Dirain Rodrigo C. Silva William O. Collins Patrick J. AntonelliDepartment of Otolaryngology University of Florida Gainesville USAINTRODUCTIONAcute otitis media AOM is one of the most common infections in children with approximately 50 to 85 of children experienc- ing at least one episode of AOM by two to three years of age 1 2.

The use of these techniques has shown far greater microbial diversity than previously shown with conventional microbiology techniques 15-17.Gene pyrosequencing has been utilized to study the prevalence of bacterial families in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from children with AOM and to compare nasal microbial communities in children with and without otitis media 18 19.

The PCR reaction conditions for amplification of DNA were 95degC for 15 s and 40 cycles of 95degC for 3 s and 58.5degC for 30 s. Dissociation or melting curves were generat-ed immediately after the real-time PCR run to check for non-specific product formation.Statistical AnalysisPower analysis was conducted using GPower statistical analysis and using the criteria that at least 25 difference in a species abundance between RAOM and OSA will be observed based on a previous sim- ilar study a 20 standard deviation in each group an a of 0.05 and power of 0.80 we determined that at least 7 samples is needed for each group for the pyrosequencing analysis.Differences in the relative abundance of all operational taxonomic units OTUs among groups were evaluated using distance based redundancy analysis dbRDA 28.

Tano and colleagues have shown that the alpha-hemolytic streptococci from children with RAOM are less effective at inhibiting middle ear pathogens than those from children without otitis media 37.

The eco- nomic and social burden of AOM and its sequelae is considerable particularly in the first five years of life hence AOM remains the focus of much investigation 8.It is well known that the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenza and Moraxella catarrhalis 9 10.

Additionally our observation that adenoids from patients with RAOM have higher prevalence of S. pneumoniae in conjunction with the presence of P. aeruginosa may lend sup- port to earlier findings that the risk of P. aeruginosa otitis media is increased by prior acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae in the chinchilla model 35.One factor that can contribute to the transition from a healthy to a disease state is the disequilibrium of the indigenous microflora or commensal bacteria.

After DNA extraction DNAquantity A260 nm and quality A260 nm A280 nm were determined using a spectrophotometer Synergytm HT BioTek Instruments Inc. WinooskiVT with Gen5 software.Total bacterial load was assessed using a 16S primer set 16S For- ward 5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG3' and 16S Reverse 5'-TTACCG-CGG CTGCTGG-3'.

Adenoid specimens were obtained from children between 2 and 11 years old who were undergoing routine adenoidectomy for RAOM n7 or OSA without otitis media n13.
