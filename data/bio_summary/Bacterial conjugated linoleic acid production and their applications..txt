the first process is from la to monoenoic acid followed by the process from monoenoic acid to stearic acid .

however when the gene was cloned into var- ious expression systems no cla was produced although recombinant bacillus subtilis produced a fatty acid with the same molecular weight as a hydroxylated linoleic acid derivative at the expense of linoleic acid .

this finding suggests that the two hy- droxyl fatty acids are intermediates in cla production starting with hydration of linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-octadecenoic acid and sub- sequent dehydrating isomerization of the hydroxyl fatty acid to cla.furthermore hydroxyl fatty acids when used as substrate were con- verted to cla by l. acidophilus.

10-hydroxyl-cis-12-octadeneic acid 10-oxo-cis-12-octadeneic acid 10-oxo-trans-octadeneic acid are detected which is considered as the intermediates during the iso- merization of la into cla.

furthermore the advances and potential in the heterologous expression of cla genetic determinants will be presented.introductionconjugated linoleic acid cla refers to a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid c182 c9c12 with conjugated double bonds.

cla could also be accumulated at a level of up to 2700 mgl by l. plantarum jcm1551 with ricinoleic acid 12-hydroxy- cis-9-octadecenoic acid as the substrate .

linoleic acid could be converted into different hydroxyl fatty acids such as 10-hoe 1013-dihoa and 13- hydroxy-cis-9-ocatadecenoic acid 13-hoe.

lactis ccrc 10791 and s. thermophilus ccrc 12257 were reported to convert free linoleic acid in skim milk plus 12 free linoleic acid .

p. acnes atcc 6919 could also catalyze the production oft10c12-cla from linoleic acid at high level .additionally t10c12-cla could be also produced from linoleic acid by megasphaera elsdenii.

showed that c. sporogenes atcc 22762 could generate t10t12-cla at a low level while c9t11-cla was the major isomer produced.while c9t11-cla was the major isomer in lactic acid bacteria t10c12-cla isomer could be produced by some lactic acid bacteria strains .

bacterial cells capable of isomerizing li- noleic acid to cla exhibit greater tolerance to linoleic acid compared with bacteria that exhibit non-cla production.

it was reported that the majority of cla-producing propio- nibacteria were those inhibited by the presence of high concentrations of free linoleic acid and a positive correlation between microbial cla production and tolerance to linoleic acid was observed among the cla producing strains.
