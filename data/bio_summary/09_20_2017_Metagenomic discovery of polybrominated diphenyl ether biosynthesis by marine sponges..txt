No other bacterial species were detected in sufficient abundance to support coverage of the bmp gene cluster observed in the metagenomic data.We thus named the putative bmp gene cluster from the Clade Ia SP12 metagenome as hsbmp H. spongeliae derived bmp operon Figure 4C numbering individual genes by homology to the previously described Pseudoalteromonas bmp gene cluster4.

In the analogous variable region for Clade IV two genes hsbmp13-14 encode peptides homologous to B12-dependent iron-sulfur cluster enzymes followed by a disruptedAgarwal et al.Page 8repetition of the hsbmp5 gene encoded by hsbmp15-16 sharing 80 nucleotide identity with the hsbmp5 gene.

The hsbmp gene encoding a CYP450 hydroxylase with no analogous counterpart in the Pseudoalteromonas bmp gene cluster was designated hsbmp12 preceded by a partial 315 bp duplication of the 5'-region of the hsbmp5 gene named hsbmp11.

The requirement of an additional hydroxylase such as hsbmp12 for the natural production of polybrominated dioxins andAgarwal et al.Page 7di-OH-BDEs mirrors our prior biomimetic studies in which a flavin-dependent hydroxylase was refactored in combination with bmp5 and bmp7 for the production of polybrominated dioxins and di-OH-BDEs36.Identification of alternative hsbmp operon structuresWith the confirmation that Clade Ia SP12 hsbmp genes encode the synthesis of PBDEs we next turned to metagenomes from sponge specimens SP4 Clade IV and GUM007 CladeIII to evaluate how their hsbmp operon structures correlate with their respective polybrominated natural product variability Figure 2.

Depth of coverage was calculated using the idxstats module of samtools version 0.1.1957.Assembled scaffolds were classified according to taxonomic origin as previously described58 first performing a blastx search against the GenBank nr reference database downloaded October 16 2015 using Diamond version 0.7.9 identifying the taxonomic classification of database match sequences using DarkHorse version 1.5 at a filter setting of zero41 then tallying the taxonomic distribution of database matches for each individual scaffold.Identification of hsbmp clusters from additional sponge cladesWe used targeted amplification to capture the hsbmp gene cluster in all host clades by using metagenomic sequence data from both SP12 Clade Ia and SP4 Clade IV.

Despite the high average coverage depth we did not observe hsbmp genes in metagenomic sequences from Clade III sponge specimen GUM007.To obtain a more complete set of hsbmp operon sequences from different sponge clades we designed consensus primers based on the Clade Ia hsbmp metagenomic sequence and partially assembled scaffolds from Clade IV see Supplementary Methods for details Supplementary Figure 10 Supplementary Table 8.

The Clade IV SP4 metagenome contained hsbmp gene homologs on several small incompletely assembled scaffolds of cyanobacterial origin Supplementary Figure 8A.

The Clade IV cluster also contains a hypothetical gene with no apparent functional role hsbmp17 upstream of hsbmp6.DISCUSSIONBy integrating chemical characterization of secondary metabolites molecular taxonomic classification of sponge hosts and their associated microbiomes metagenomic sequencing and assembly targeted PCR amplifications and functional reconstruction by expression of candidate biosynthetic genes in a heterologous host we have identified clusters of microbial genes encoding proteins responsible for the natural production of PBDEs in the Indo-Pacific Dysideidae sponges.

The scattered distribution and the reduced assembly coverage depth for the SP4 metagenome as compared to the Clade Ia SP12 metagenome with comparable input reads Figures 4B Supplementary Figure 8A Supplementary Table 3 is consistent with the higher microbiome diversity and reduced H. spongeliae relative abundance in Clade IV sponges Figure 3.

The hydroxylating CYP450 hsbmp12 and hypothetical hsbmp11 genes from Clade Ia present in the variable region were absent from Clade Ib.
