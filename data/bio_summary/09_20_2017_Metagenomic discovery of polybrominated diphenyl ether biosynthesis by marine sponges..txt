No other bacterial species were detected in sufficient abundance to support coverage of the bmp gene cluster observed in the metagenomic data.We thus named the putative bmp gene cluster from the Clade Ia SP12 metagenome as hsbmp H. spongeliae derived bmp operon Figure 4C numbering individual genes by homology to the previously described Pseudoalteromonas bmp gene cluster4.

The requirement of an additional hydroxylase such as hsbmp12 for the natural production of polybrominated dioxins andAgarwal et al.Page 7di-OH-BDEs mirrors our prior biomimetic studies in which a flavin-dependent hydroxylase was refactored in combination with bmp5 and bmp7 for the production of polybrominated dioxins and di-OH-BDEs36.Identification of alternative hsbmp operon structuresWith the confirmation that Clade Ia SP12 hsbmp genes encode the synthesis of PBDEs we next turned to metagenomes from sponge specimens SP4 Clade IV and GUM007 CladeIII to evaluate how their hsbmp operon structures correlate with their respective polybrominated natural product variability Figure 2.

The scattered distribution and the reduced assembly coverage depth for the SP4 metagenome as compared to the Clade Ia SP12 metagenome with comparable input reads Figures 4B Supplementary Figure 8A Supplementary Table 3 is consistent with the higher microbiome diversity and reduced H. spongeliae relative abundance in Clade IV sponges Figure 3.

In the analogous variable region for Clade IV two genes hsbmp13-14 encode peptides homologous to B12-dependent iron-sulfur cluster enzymes followed by a disruptedAgarwal et al.Page 8repetition of the hsbmp5 gene encoded by hsbmp15-16 sharing 80 nucleotide identity with the hsbmp5 gene.

The hsbmp gene encoding a CYP450 hydroxylase with no analogous counterpart in the Pseudoalteromonas bmp gene cluster was designated hsbmp12 preceded by a partial 315 bp duplication of the 5'-region of the hsbmp5 gene named hsbmp11.

Despite the high average coverage depth we did not observe hsbmp genes in metagenomic sequences from Clade III sponge specimen GUM007.To obtain a more complete set of hsbmp operon sequences from different sponge clades we designed consensus primers based on the Clade Ia hsbmp metagenomic sequence and partially assembled scaffolds from Clade IV see Supplementary Methods for details Supplementary Figure 10 Supplementary Table 8.

The Clade IV SP4 metagenome contained hsbmp gene homologs on several small incompletely assembled scaffolds of cyanobacterial origin Supplementary Figure 8A.

All PCR results were replicated in at least two sponge samples from each clade.Consistent with their functional roles in the synthesis of PBDEs Figure 4A the hsbmp gene clusters for Clades Ib and IV contained the core repertoire of hsbmp5-7 genes and displayed high overall sequence similarity to Clade Ia across the regions spanning these operon elements Figure 4C Supplementary Table 9.

The subsequent structural diversification of 1 is biosynthetically encoded within the variable region between the hsbmp7 and hsbmp6 genes in Clade Ia and Clade IV hsbmp operons Figure 4C.

Multiple samples were obtained corresponding to Clades Ia Ib III and IV while no specimens belonging to the Dysideidae Clade II were identified in our collection.Agarwal et al.Page 4Mass spectrometry and NMR analyses of sponge extracts revealed clear correlations between the sponge ITS-2 sequence phylogeny Figure 2A and polybrominated phenolic chemistry Figure 2B.
