all genus members with occupancies higher than 0.1 in either wild-type blue or tg-appps1 mice red are presented n5 each.tion.in comparing the results of the present study with those pub- lished in the literature it may be worth noting that the altered occupancy of pfirmicutes in tg-appps1 mice from 34.7 to 57.5 z 3.45 in the present study was similar to a recently re- ported increase of this phylum in 5xfad mice from 34 to 49 p0.003 9. on the other hand the decrease in occupancy of p bacteroidetes was more prominent in 5xfad mice from 61 to 46 p0.003 9 than in tg-appps1 mice from 17.8 to 8.7 z -0.73. the occupancy of pproteobacteria decreased in tg- appps1 mice from 30.5 to 20.7z-1.56 whereas no informa- tion on this phylum member was available in 5xfad mice table 3.at the genus level tg-appps1 mice exhibited decreases in oc- cupancy of gallobaculum  and ganaerostipes  and increasesin occupancy of godoribacter  gstreptococcus and gdorea .

of the 130 genus members with relative occupancies 0.1 in either wild type or tg-appps1 mice 39 members were upregulated and 16 members were downregulated in tg-appps1 mice by more than one sd relative to wild-type mice while the remaining 70 mem- bers were unchanged in tg-appps1 mice.

microbiomes secrete membrane vesicles also called extracellular vesicles evs or shedding microvesicles 10 11. gram-negative bacterial evs are small in size 10 to 300 nm in diameter and have a lipopolysaccharide lps-containing outer membrane and periplasmic constituents 11 12. gram- positive bacterial evs are also small in size 50150 nm in diam- eter 13 14. bacterial evs contain bacterial dna fragments rnas adhesins toxins lipoproteins phospholipids peptidogly- cans and immunomodulatory compounds 10 13-17. due to their small size bacterial membrane vesicles are permeable to the cellular membrane of the intestinal barrier and are thereby distrib- uted throughout the body including blood 18 19. these results suggest that blood serum can be used as an alternative route for metagenome analysis of bodily microbiota.in the present study we investigated whether bacterial evs in blood would be useful for the assessment of bodily microbiota in tg-appps1 mice.materials and methodsanimalstg-appsweps1de9 tg-appps1 for short mice 20 were ob- tained from the jackson laboratories bar harbor me usa.

1c.the microbiota for which occupancies in tg-appps1 mice were altered at the class order and family levels are further speci- fied and summarized in table 1. among pfirmicutes members the changes in cbacilli is remarkable particularly the increase of faerococcaceae and fleuconostocaceae and the decrease of f lactobacillaceae in tg-appps1 mice.

among pactinobacteria  fcorynebacteriaceae notably de- creased in tg-appps1 mice table 1.we continued to analyze the occupancies of specific genus mem- bers in tg-appps1 mice relative to wild-type controls.

of these altered genus members 17 were newly detected in tg-appps1 mice but not in wild-type mice while 12 were detected in wild-type mice but lost in tg-appps1 mice table 2. the heat-map analysis in fig.

the total relative occupancy of these 55 3916 altered genus members was 29.9 in wild-type mice and 52.2 in tg-appps1 mice table 2. of the 55 altered genus members 9 had occupancies 0.1 in either wild-type or tg-appps1 mice.

2b.discussionmetagenome analysis of bacterial evs in blood identified altered bodily microbiota compositions in tg-appps1 mice we demonstrated in the present study that bodily microbiotacompositions were altered in tg-appps1 mice compared to those of non-transgenic control.

this increase was comprised change in the following genus members gaerococcus from 0.02 to 10.45gjeotgalicoccus from 0.83 to 8.50 an unclassified member of oclostridiales from 4.66 to 7.03 gblautia from 0.12 to 1.37 and an unclassified member of fruminococcaceae from 2.44 to 6.09. in contrast to these genus members glactobacillus decreased from 5.57 to 3.13.the total occupancy of pproteobacteria decreased from 30.5table 1. the percent compositions of microbiomes at the levels of class order and family in wild-type and tg-appps1 micethe family members of microbiomes for which occupancy differed by more than one standard deviation sd one z in tg-appps1 mice from that of wild-type mice are presented along with the higher taxonomy levels.

it was notable that gcorynebacterium  a genus member of pactinobacteria  decreased from 3.50 to 0.94 and that an unclassified member offs24-7 a genus member of pbacteroidetes decreased from 6.30 to 1.81.as summarized with the results of the heat-map analysis certain genus members were newly detected in tg-appps1 mice but not in wild-type mice while other members were detected in wild- type mice but lost in tg-appps1 mice.

a recent study reported that the occupancy of godoribacter increased in the gut of aged mice 27 and in tg-appps1 this study and 3xtg mouse 7. these results suggest that the in- crease of godoribacter in tg-appps1 mice is likely related to ad pathology rather than simple aging.

among the altered microbiota a number of genus members were detected in tg-appps1 mice but not in wild-type mice while other genus members were identified in wild-type mice but not in tg-appps1 mice.

the z-score was calculated as x - ms where mmean xindividual score sstandard deviation sd.resultstg-appps1 mice show plaque deposition in the brain start- ing from 6.5 months of age and severe cognitive deficits at 77.5 months 24-26. bacterial evs in blood were collected from 8-month-old tg-appps1 mice and their wild-type controls and bacterial dna was extracted from prepared evs as described in the materials and methods.

pcr amplification of variable regions of 16s ribosomal rna rrna genes and subsequent sequence readings led us to identify approximately 2500 and 3200 otus for wild-type and tg-appps1 mice respectively.
