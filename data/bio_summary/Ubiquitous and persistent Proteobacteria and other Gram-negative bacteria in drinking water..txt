Therefore the identification of the most ubiquitous and persis- tent bacteria in drinking water may contribute to improve the current knowledge not only on the ecology of bacteria in drinking water sys- tems but also on the potential human-health risks associated with their presence in tap water.This study aimed at identifying culturable Gram-negative bacteria from tap water with widespread distribution in tap water and in its source ubiquitous or suggested as possible resident bacteria when were found at different sampling occasions persistent.

This was an ap- proach to infer about the occurrence of acquired antibiotic resistance or related genes in tap water and their relationship with the tap water cul- tivable bacterial communities.In most of the tap water samples the genes intI1 and blaTEM were above or close to the limit of quantification LOQ intI1 gene  140 cop- iesL LOQ blaTEM gene  1230 copiesL Fig.

In contrast most of the Alphaproteobacteria prefer habitats with very low levels of nutrients a preference that confers an advantage to survive in the tap water environment  .In agreement with the high prevalence of Alphaproteobacteria in tap water a high number of genera from this class was observed to be ubiqui- tous in tap water Blastomonas Brevundimonas Methylobacterium Sphingobium and Sphingomonas.

Of the 1089 isolates confirmed as non-repetitive 795 were identified to species level .Persistent and ubiquitous Gram-negative taxaAs a way to make the analysis of the results more objective the gen- era or species of the isolates were classified as ubiquitous andor persis- tent according to the following criteria a ubiquitous genus wasTotal1527 48.41089795 73.0 135identified at least in five of the 11 sampled taps or in the three types of water rawozonated final treated and tap water a persistent spe- cies was identified in the same site in all the three sampling campaigns or in the first and third campaign.Determination of MICs to antibiotics and metals in the ubiquitous tap water bacteriaAt least 10 of the isolates of each genus classified as ubiquitous n  9 Blastomonas n  326 Brevundimonas n  634 Methylobacterium n  517 Sphingobium n  524 Sphingomonas n  1054 Acidovorax n  729 Ralstonia n  434 Acinetobacter n  21155 and Pseudomonas n  748 were characterized for the MIC to selected antibiotics and metals based on the microdilution method as described by .

The antimicrobials tested were selected based on the fact that the resistance to amoxicillin is frequent in tap water bac- teria often due to intrinsic mechanisms and because in some studies re- sistance to aminoglycosides was observed in tap water but not in the water source suggesting a selection effect  .

The rationale for the selection of the heavy metals arsenite and copper was the common occurrence of arsenic in natural waters  and the presence of copper in some of the materials used for the water pipes.Detection and quantification of genes in total DNA extracts of tap waterThe genes 16S rRNA intI1 blaTEM sul1 and qnrS were quantified in three replicates of total DNA extracts obtained from 15 L of water ineach sampling date of the 11 household tap water samples   using quantitative PCR as described before .Statistical analysisA Principal Components Analysis PCA was performed with the MIC values for the tested isolates belonging to ubiquitous genera.

Possible correlations between the diversity of species found and their abundance in tap water and the total and cultivable bacteria counts  and the abundance of the selected genes detected in tap water samples were assessed based on Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA using the log-transformed values of each variable.

The dendrogram was constructed with the iTOL - interactive tree of life  based on the taxon ID codes.ResultsPhyla and classes bacterial identificationThe tap water analyzed in this study undergoes different treatment stages  and for a matter of simplicity from this point forward water source includes raw and ozonated water treated water in- cludes samples collected after chlorination and tap water includes household taps.

The combination of differ- ent degrees of tolerance to the tested antimicrobials is expressed in the PCA biplot  that suggests the organization of four major groups according to the MIC values.Detection and quantification of antibiotic resistance or related genes in tap waterGiven their widespread distribution in environmental samples the genes intI1 blaTEM sul1 and qnrS   were surveyed in total DNA extracts of tap water.
