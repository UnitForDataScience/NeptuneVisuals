and others which has shown that the genetic and taxonomic composition of the placental microbiota closely resemble those of the oral cavity.Compositional and functional development of the gut microbiota during infancy After birth the gut microbiota of a newborn is transiently dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus.Thereafter an infant's gut microbiota is dominated by Bifidobacterium and some lactic acid bacteria.Bifidobacterium-dominated microbiota called Bifidus flora is maintained until the introduction of solid food.After weaning Bifidus flora is outcompeted by adult-type microorganisms represented mainly by bacteria in the genera Bacteroides Prevotella Ruminococcus Clostridium and Veillonella which colonize an infant's intestines.Eventually by about three years of age a typical adult-like gut microbiota is established.The functions of the gut microbiota also change greatly before and after the introduction of weaning foods.

Indeed excessive Th1 or Th2 activation results in chronic inflammation and auto- immune or allergic disease.Gut microbiota aberrations associated with allergy developmentColonization of intestines with bacteria and the development of a gut microbiota in infancy are closely related to the development of the immune system.In fact altered development of gut microbiotas is suspected to be associated with the onset of autoimmune or allergic diseases.Numerous cohort studies have shown that alterations in the gut microbiota during infancy and early childhood are associated with allergic diseases .

The functional repertoire of an infant's microbiota changes during the first year of life as the early microbiota before weaning is enriched in bacteria with genes thatFig.

Diversity of the gut microbiota increases with age until it becomes a stable adult microbiota.

This process of establishing the gut microbiota is affected by various factors such as delivery mode methods of milk feeding the introduction of solid foods and foods consumed daily in childhood.facilitate lactate utilization whereas after weaning solid foods promote the growth of bacteria enriched in genes coding to allow the utilization of a larger variety of carbohydrates vitamin syn- thesis and xenobiotic degradation.Effect of the mode of newborn deliveryA number of studies have indicated that the mode of delivery affects the development of the gut microbiota in early life.

Inter- estingly the gut microbiota of a newborn will closely resemble the microbiota that it encountered during birth.

In addition the microbiotas and FA profiles in milk were different in Europe Spain and Finland Africa South Africa and Asia China.However there is little understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of FA in breast milk on the development of the host immune system and how they may be related to the establishment of the gut microbiota in infancy.Perturbation by antibioticsThe use of antibiotic in early life has profound effects on the development of the gut microbiota.

The use of antibiotics in infants shifts the composition of the gut microbiota toward a high abun- dance of Proteobacteria and low abundance of Actinobacteria populations decreases the overall diversity of the infant's microbiota and selects for drug-resistant bacteria.According to some epidemiological surveys the use of antibiotics in early life increases the risk of developing allergic diseases such as asthma atopic disease eczema and type 1 diabetes.Tanaka et al.

Simultaneously the immune system matures through bidirectional interactions with the gut microbiota promoting the development of the immune system but also the host immune system shaping the development of the gut microbiota.
