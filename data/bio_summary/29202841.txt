Quantification was done by using standard curves made from known concentrations of plasmid DNA containing the re- spective amplicon for each set of primers.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed with RStudio The R Foundation for Statistical Computing version 3.1.0 using the gamm4 package for R version 0.2-2.To test the effect of both dietary protein levels on composition and functionality of microbiota in lean and obese dogs and their effect on host metabolism a gen- eral additive mixed model was used Y  m  dog  diet  BC  group  D x BC  e where m is the overall mean Dog a random effect diet refers to HP or LP BC is the body condition of the dogs lean vs. obese group is the order by which dogs received the diets groups 1-4 and refers to the carry-over effect D x BC is the interaction between diet and body condition and refers to the direc- tion or size of the effect of dietary protein on lean and obese animals and e is the error term.Faecal concentration of valerate and p-cresol were only detected in three and one samples respectively and hence these parameters were not taken into consider- ation when performing the statistical analysis.For the D x BC the nparcomp package of R was used version 2.0 for post-hoc test by creating dummy vari- ables and an own contrast matrix.Statistical significance was accepted at P  0.05.Table 2 Ingredient composition and nutrient analysis of the experimental dietsItemsLPHP IngredientsAs-is basis g100 gNutrient AnalysisDM g100 g92.796.2g100 g DMLP low protein diet HP high protein diet CP crude protein DM dry matter EE ether extract CF crude fibre ME metabolizable energy NFE nitrogen-free extract TDF total dietary fibre1Animal digest a material which results from chemical andor enzymatichydrolysis of clean and undecomposed animal tissue  2Calculated NFE   DM -  EE  CP   ash   CF 3Calculated ME  16.7xg CP  37.7xg Fat 16.7xg NFE ResultsFood energy and protein intakeTwo obese dogs one from group 3 and one from group4 were excluded from the study due to injuries not as- sociated with the present study.

These results are in agreement with previous studies in dogs fed high protein diets  In addition higher serum concentrations of indoxyl sulphate and 3- OH isovalerylcarnitine in dogs fed HP were observed supporting colonic production and absorption of protein fermentation metabolites To date no toxicity or tolerance tests have been performed on the effects of protein fermentation metabolites on canine gut health and the only studies available concerning the link be- tween protein fermentation and canine gut health have evaluated the effects of prebiotics probiotics and synbio- tics .

and Haliangium ochraceum which are capable of brea- king down aromatic putrefactive substances were in- creased in cats fed a high protein diet Therefore whether the increased protein fermentation metabolites are harmful for dogs needs to be further investigated es- pecially the beneficial effects of indole that have been proposed by in vitro studies such as the increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and strengthening of epithelial cell barrier properties ConclusionsIn our study high protein diet promoted the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria which includes clostridial clusters I IV and XIVa in dogs independent of body condition and importantly this butyrate synthesis issuggested to relate to the BK pathway as compared to BCoAT pathway in humans.

This should be taken into consideration in future nutritional interven- tions and disease prevention.Additional fileAbbreviations3OH-C4 3-OH butyrylcarnitine 3OH-C5 3-OH isovalerylcarnitine BC Body condition BCoAT Butyryl CoA acetate CoA transferase BCS Body condition score BK Butyrate kinase BW Body weight C0 Free carnitineC2 Acetylcarnitine C3 Propionylcarnitine C3DC MalonylcarnitineC4 Butyryl- and isobutyrylcarnitine C5 Isovalerylcarnitine CoA Co-enzyme A CP Crude protein D x BC Interaction between diet and body condition DGGE Denaturing gradient gel-electrophoresis DM Dry matter EE Ether extract EI Energy intake FI Food intake HP High protein diet LP Low protein diet NFE Nitrogen free extract PI Protein intake SCFA Short-chain fatty acids TDF Total dietary fibreAcknowledgmentsThe work of J.

Therefore assessing terminal genes of butyrate synthesis pathways could provide valuable information specifically target the activity of the butyrate-producing bacterial community.The aim of the present study was 1 to investigate the impact of dietary protein on faecal microbial profile and functionality especially focusing on butyrate-producing microbiota and the concomitant fermentation and host metabolic profile in dogs and 2 to compare the re- sponse of lean and obese dogs to two different levels of dietary protein.

Prior to the study dogs were deemed healthy apart from obesity in six dogs based on physical exams complete blood counts and serum biochemistry.Two isocaloric experimental diets Table a high protein diet HP which consisted of 50.0 g crude pro- tein CP 12.2 g ether extract EE and 32.2 g nitrogen free extract NFE on 100 g dry matter DM basis and a low protein diet LP which consisted of 17.8 g CP13.6 g EE and 62.3 g NFE on 100 g DM basis were for- mulated with the same ingredients NV Versele-Laga.
