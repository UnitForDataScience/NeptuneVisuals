these results are in agreement with previous studies in dogs fed high protein diets  in addition higher serum concentrations of indoxyl sulphate and 3- oh isovalerylcarnitine in dogs fed hp were observed supporting colonic production and absorption of protein fermentation metabolites to date no toxicity or tolerance tests have been performed on the effects of protein fermentation metabolites on canine gut health and the only studies available concerning the link be- tween protein fermentation and canine gut health have evaluated the effects of prebiotics probiotics and synbio- tics .

and haliangium ochraceum which are capable of brea- king down aromatic putrefactive substances were in- creased in cats fed a high protein diet therefore whether the increased protein fermentation metabolites are harmful for dogs needs to be further investigated es- pecially the beneficial effects of indole that have been proposed by in vitro studies such as the increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and strengthening of epithelial cell barrier properties conclusionsin our study high protein diet promoted the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria which includes clostridial clusters i iv and xiva in dogs independent of body condition and importantly this butyrate synthesis issuggested to relate to the bk pathway as compared to bcoat pathway in humans.

therefore assessing terminal genes of butyrate synthesis pathways could provide valuable information specifically target the activity of the butyrate-producing bacterial community.the aim of the present study was 1 to investigate the impact of dietary protein on faecal microbial profile and functionality especially focusing on butyrate-producing microbiota and the concomitant fermentation and host metabolic profile in dogs and 2 to compare the re- sponse of lean and obese dogs to two different levels of dietary protein.
