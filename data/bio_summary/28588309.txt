The explained variance of the principal axes Axis 1 horizontally and Axis 2 vertically are 9.319 and 6.008 respectively The species explained 39.82 of the total information amount.

The butyrate producing bacteria Roseburia Faecalibacterium Clostridium Coprococcus and Prevotella were reduced in the ESRD group LDA values  2.0.

In qPCR analysis The butyrate producing species Roseburia spp.

The enterotypes change from Prevotella to Bacteroides in ESRD patients.

The gut microbiota was associated with the inflammatory state and renal function of chronic kidney disease.The human gut is immensely populated with microorganisms predominantly anaerobic bacteria.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify differences in the composition of gut microbiota in ESRD patients in southern China.Materials and MethodsStudy subjects.

The study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Southern Medical University Guangzhou China.

The underlying cause of 21 ESRD patients was chronic glomerulonephritis 11 was hypertensive nephropathy 6 was obstructive nephropathy 3 was polycystic kidney disease 2 was systemic lupus erythema- tosus 2 was chronic pyelonephritis 7 was unclear.

The rest patients have never been treated with dialysis.
