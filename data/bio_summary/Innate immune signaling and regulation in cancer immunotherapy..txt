If tumor cells are not completely eliminated then immune inhibitory pathways suppress T cell activation as part of a negative feedback loop.as DNGR1 which potentiates cross-presentation of an- tigens derived from necrotic cells 42 and secrete IL-12 leading to TH1 polarization 43 44.The role of type I IFNs is critical in the early stag-es of anti-tumor immune response because a blocking antibody against this cytokine prevented rejection of atransplantable immunogenic tumor if administered with- in the first 4-6 days of tumor growth but had no effect at later time points 32.

Thus intratumoral expression of type I IFNs may even prompt tumor-infiltrating Batf3 DCs to cross-prime naive CD8 T cells in the tumor bypassing the need for migration to the draining lymph nodes.The STING pathway and innate immune sensing of tumorsA major conundrum had been how antigen-present- ing cells APCs in the tumor microenvironment could productively cross-present tumor antigens to T cells in the absence of pathogen-derived factors.

The initial innate immune sensing of tumors results in recruitment activation and clonal expansion of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells which have the potential to kill cognate tumor cells.

One explanation for the failure of complete tumor elimination by spontaneous immune responses is the observation that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes TILs become dysfunctional via dominant suppressive mecha- nisms in the tumor microenvironment 13 14.

Thus in patients with T cell-inflamed tumors elimination of selected suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microen- vironment and reactivation of the dysfunctional T cells leads to improvement of tumor control.

Despite these positive advances only a fraction of cancer patients within each tumor type exhibits a spontaneous T cell-in- flamed tumor phenotype and clinical response to these checkpoint blockade agents.

They are recruited back to the tumor microenvironment under the influence of CXCL9 and CXCL10 also released by Batf3 DCs in the tumor microenvironment.

Dynamic movement of infiltrated CD8 effector T cells results in direct contact with tumor cells which can lead to tumor cell death.

Collectively these findings support a model in which type I IFN production in the tumor facilitates antigen cross-presentation by Batf3 DCs which then migrate via the lymphatics to the tumor-draining lymph nodes where they cross-prime naive CD8 T cells.In further support of a pivotal role of Batf3 DCs in anti-tumor immunity a recent study demonstrated that CD103 DCs in the lung internalize membrane-bound cytoplasmic material which they termed cytoplast re- leased in the lung vasculature by circulating tumor cells 47.

Other cells in the tumor can contribute to production of type I IFNs including tumor endothelial cells 51.The involvement of type I IFNs in the innate immune sensing of cancer provided a tool for probing candidate PRR pathways.
