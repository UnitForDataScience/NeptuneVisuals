The single SNP differentiating between Groups I and II is indicated by a perpendicular red line on the branch between nodes d and k. B MLVA phylogenies of 10 and 38 Malagasy Y. pestis samples from basal SNP nodes d and k respectively.

Alignment and SNP calling methods were wrapped by the Northern Arizona SNP Pipeline NASP  .New SNP screeningPrimers were designed targeting a 250 bp region around each of 188 newly identified poten- tial SNP targets  using Primer3   with strain CO92 as the reference sequence and with the potential SNP located at the center of each amplicon.

In Madagascar the high and low plague seasons are associated with similar Y. pestis population expansions and contractions as indicated by higher levels of both Y. pestis seroprevalence in rats  and numbers of human cases   during the high plague season compared to the low season.

However compared to other subgroups there was far more overlap and fewer distinct geographic patterns among the individual nodes particularly for subgroups h j and v. All three of these subgroups contained several nodes that were dispersed across the overall geo- graphic distribution of their respective subgroups including h03 h05 and h11 for subgroup h j01 -j03 and j05 for subgroup j and v09 and v11 -v13 for subgroup v Figs  .Similar to the geographically dispersed nodes within subgroup s most of these nodes were more basal within the phylogeny andor contained larger numbers of samples and consider- able MLVA diversity  .

In addition as previously determined   it was also the subgroup respon- sible for the re-emergence of plague in the port city of Mahajanga during the 1990s .Individual SNP defined nodes within subgroup s displayed some additional spatial clustering with newly identified nodes s10 -s11 found mostly in the south in districts Ambositra and southern Fandriana s14 found mostly in districts Soavinandriana and Faratsiho s15 -s16 iso- lated to district Faratsiho and s17 -s18 and s20 -s22 found mostly in Antananarivo and the immediately adjacent district Manjakandriana.

Overallspatial clustering of the individual nodes was consistent with the SNP phylogeny withGeographic distributions of identified SNP nodes within Group I.

The resulting SNP matrix was filtered to focus on the SNPs to be verified.Phylogeographic analysesA SNP phylogeny was generated for all 773 samples using data from 42 informative SNPs from the 63 screened previously identified SNPs and 170 additional informative SNPs identified here from among the 188 potential new SNP targets  and Tables.

Periodically Y. pestis emerges from these enzootic reservoirs in large-scale epizootics involving massive die-offs of highly sus- ceptible rodent species that serve to amplify and spread Y. pestis   .Alternating enzootic and epizootic cycles human involvement and ecology have all con- tributed to the observed phylogeography of Y. pestis and its consistent pattern of the spread of one to a few genotypes followed by localized differentiation.

To address that gap and further inform our understanding of plague epidemiology we investi- gated the phylogeography of Y. pestis in Madagascar over an 18 year period.MethodologyPrincipal findingsWe generated whole genome sequences for 31 strains and discovered new SNPs that we used in conjunction with previously identified SNPs and variable-number tandem repeats VNTRs to genotype 773 Malagasy Y. pestis samples from 1995 to 2012.

We also found evidence of various Y. pestis dispersal events including over long distances but no evidence that any dispersal events resulted in successful establish- ment of a transferred genotype in a new location during the examined time period.ConclusionsSignificanceOur analysis suggests that persistent endemic cycles of Y. pestis transmission within local areas are responsible for the long term maintenance of plague in Madagascar rather thanHSHQDC-10-C-00139 to PK the Cowden Endowment at Northern Arizona University and Wellcome fellowships 081705 and 095171 to ST.
