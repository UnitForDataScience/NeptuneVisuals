The selected studied agar media were the following Plate Count Agar CM0325 Oxoid for total viable counts incubated at 30 oC for 48e72 h de Man-Rogosa-Sharp MRS me- dium CM 0361 Oxoid for LAB adjusted to pH 5.7 overlaid with the same medium and incubated at 30 oC for 48e72 h Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol Agar Base LAB036 supplemented with selective supplement 009 LAB M for yeastsmolds incubated at 25 oC for 48e72 h Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar CM 0485 Oxoid for Enterobacteriaceae overlayed with the same medium and incubated at 37 oC for 24 h Pseudomonas agar base CM559 supplemented with selective supplement CFC SR0103 OXOID for Pseudomonas spp.

Further details of the High Pressure system and operating conditions can be found elsewhere .After the HPP treatment the samples were divided according to their origin from the 2 different meat batchesdifferent inoculum HPP treatmentcontrol samples not HPP treated and stored at 4 and 12 oC in high precision -0.5 oC incubation chambers VELP Scientifica Usmate MB Italy until spoilage was pronounced discoloration and presence of off-odors and non-inoculatedsamples were characterized from sensory analysis as spoiled.

This protein coagulation and contraction of the muscle bundles as reported by induce a firmer texture in the HPP samples 300 MPa 35 oC 1 min and 400 MPa 30 oC 1 in com- parison with the control that explains the increased coherence of cooked HPP samples in this study.Although high-pressure treatments induced visible modifica- tions in raw meat's color the color difference was reported also by others to be greatly reduced after cooking  .

incubated at 25 oC for 48 h Xylose lysine deoxycholate XLD CM 0469 Oxoid for Salmonella incubated at 37 oC for 16e18 h. In all growth media incubation time was extended by 1e2 days for the HPP samples to allow recovery of lethallysublethally injured or stressed by HPP treatment cells.

At each time point 3 packages of inoculated samples from each case and batch were used for microbial enumeration and pH analysis and 3 for enrichment and 3 samples from the non-inoculated samples were used for sensory analysis.Microbiological analysis25 g of chicken fillets sample were aseptically added to 50 ml sterile 14 Ringer's solution and homogenized in a stomacher Stomacher 400 Circulator Seward for 60 s at room temperature.

At the low inoculum level the pathogen could not be detected with the enrichment method after the first storage days 2nd day for 4 oC and 0 day for 12 oC.

From the results it was evident that HPP may enhance the safety and increase the shelf life 6 at 4 oC and 2 days at 12 oC of chicken meat.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionGlobal meat production rose by almost 20 over the last decade mostly by the growth in poultry and pigmeat.

The strains were revived from astock culture stored at 80 oC subcultured into 10 ml Brain HeartInfusion Broth BHI LabM LAB049 and incubated overnight at 37 oC.

The S. Enteritidis population in sliced cooked ham was reduced 5 log CFUg after HPP of 450 MPa5 minand the numbers did not increase significantly during the 35 days of storage at 4 oC while at 10 oC the population varied between 1 and 3 log CFUg .

During storage at 12 oC the initial strain distribution was similar to this at 4 oC as it was expected i.e.
