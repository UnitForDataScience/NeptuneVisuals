species SRB sulfate-reducing bacteria TMA trimethylamine TMAO trimethylamine-N-oxideThe human gut microbiomeThe human gut is home to 100 trillion microorganisms most of which live in the colon the distal part of the gastrointesti- nal tract.

Collectively these microbes are called the human gut microbiota or if also referring to their genomes and the surrounding habitat the human gut microbiome.

Our gut microbes are basically small biochemical factories expanding our body's metabolic capacities many times Grice and Segre 2012.The gut microbiome is intricately connected to other organs and our general health.

The fast response of the gut microbiome to such changes is thoughtto be the result of the rapid growth rate of many bacterial species and the regular large expulsion of gut contents Sonnenburg and Backhed 2016.

In addition to these rapid temporal responses age has been shown to affect the compo- sition of the gut microbiome as well albeit at a much slower rate O'Toole and Jeffery 2015.Despite these temporal and population differences patterns of gut microbial composition in health are starting to emerge.

2012 emphasizing that the composition of the gut microbiome is not as much about 'Who is there' but about 'What are they doing' This metabolic functional redundancy is likely to confer stability and resilience to the gut microbiota in the setting of dietary and environmental disturbances Moya and Ferrer 2016.

2017.Metabolism of human milk in infantsThe microbiome and metabolic reactions of the human in- fant gut are distinct from those of the adult gut.

Here we will list some recent discoveries in this field as a foretaste of the excit- ing possibilities to come.First Oxalobacter formigenes is an -degrading anaerobic gut bacterium thought to protect against hyperoxaluria and kidney stones by decreasing the amount and absorption of oxalate in the gut Siener et al.

Knowledge of the composition and metabolic activity of an individual's gut microbiota can be extremely helpful in predicting that individual's response to certain drugs Ursell and Knight 2013 Klaassen and Cui 2015.Concluding remarksThis review has provided a broad overview of known biochemical reactions performed by microbes in the human gut and their importance for human physiology.
