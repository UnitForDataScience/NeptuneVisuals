therefore the development of th cells can be controlled by the microbiota and the disturbance of th-cell development by an altered microbiota may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases.recently emerging reports have highlighted the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflamma- tory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ra type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus dm and asthma.

therefore it has been demonstrated that in various genetically susceptible models the gut microbiota could orchestrate the development of auto- immune arthritis through a th cell-mediated pathway.beyond the gut microbiota the association of the oral and lung microbiota with ra disease pathology has been described.

similarly gf mice transferred with the gut microbiota of hfd-fed mice showed a greater increase in total body fat than those transferred with normal microbiota.importantly it has been demonstrated that hfd-induced gut microbiota causes a reduction of intestinal th17 cells through the impairment of the ability of intestinal antigen-presenting cells to induce functional th17 cells.7 karlsson and qin research groups have observed the changes in the gut microbiota in t2d and surprisingly found a decrease in an scfa-producing strainclostridia known as a potent inducer of treg cells.

of interest  160 distinct bacterial species have been found to differ in each individual and the relative abundance of common bacterial phyla is also different in each individual.the composition and abundance of the microbiota may be affected beginning early in life by such factors as genetics prenatal environment diet and antibiotic treatment.the host immune system has co-evolved with the micro- biota populating the human body and this microbiota provides many beneficial functions to its host including synthesizing nutrients protecting against invasion by pathogens and regulating immune responses to self-antigens.

altered commensal microbiota in the gut or lung could influence the progression of various tissue-specific diseases through signal mediators including microbes microbial metabolites and circulating immune cells.cells and il-17 levels are also increased in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with ra.although genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses have found genetic risk factors like hla-dr the pathogenesis of ra cannot be fully interpreted by considering only genetic variations.recently the gut microbiota has been proposed as an indispensable environmental factor in the progression of ra.

thus the composition of the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the balance between inflammatory th cells and suppressive treg cells to maintain immune tolerance under healthy conditions.the alteration of the gut microbiota namely dysbiosis may influence immune tolerance and lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as ra in genetically susceptible models.in a murine experimental model the colonization of sfb in the gut of spontaneous arthritis-prone kb x n mice under gf conditions leads to the induction of functional th17 cells and the reduction of treg cells driving the onset of autoimmune arthritis.

interestingly gf mice that lack any exposure to microbes and microbial colonization showed more severe immune responses of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation suggesting that the commensal microbiota is essential for developing a normal immune system and protect- ing against airway inflammation.with the progress of recent serological approaches to identify microbe-specific antibodies and species-targeted pcr-based approaches several studies have shown that the upper and lower airways of patients with asthma have a bacterial microbiota distinct from that of healthy people which indicates a relationship between airway microbial diversity and susceptibility to asthma.chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae infec- tions have been found to be associated with the acute exacerbation of asthma.

to systematically overcome the limits of human microbiota research various mouse model systems have been used for mechanistic inves- tigations due to the fact that they have strong similarities with human genetics and the human gut microbiota.

in an attempt to understand the effects of the human microbiota humanmicrobiota-associated mice have been developed and used in human-like ecologic systems.although we present the interplay between the microbiota and t cells in healthy and disease conditions the overall immune system is a complex network affected by genetic susceptibility and various environmental triggers that initiate and contribute to disease progression.

in particular commensal microbiota is necessary in the development induction and function of t cells to maintain host immune homeostasis.

alterations in the compositional diversity and abundance levels of microbiota known as dysbiosis can trigger several types of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases through the imbalance of t-cell subpopulations such as th1 th2 th17 and treg cells.

the human body is continuously exposed to environmental microorganisms and is colonized by a variety of microbes known collectively as the microbiota that comprise an ecological community of commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms.

with the development of culture-independent modern techni- ques for detecting microorganisms such as 16s rrna-dna sequencing and whole-genome shotgun sequencing  1200 different bacterial species have been commonly identified in the human gut microbiota the majority of which is composed of five phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes actinobacteria proteo- bacteria and verrucomicrobia.

this suggests that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in the balance of the host immune system between activation and tolerance.

among the various immune cells the microbiota has been shown to be associated with the development of th1 th2 th17 and treg cells.
