somedietary fibers can also be classified as prebiotic.prebi- otics are defined as selectively fermented ingredients that result in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus conferring benefits upon host health.this review discusses the impact of consumption of dietary fibers and prebiotics on the gastrointestinal microbiota including the role of the ingredients' physiochemical properties and dose as well as the phenotypic responses related to the composition of the resident microbiota.the role of diet fiber and prebiotics on the gastrointestinal microbiomethe capacity of diet to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota of humans and other mammals has been extensively studied indicating that the composition of the diet habitual dietary intake and acute dietary changes all impact the microbial communities within the gut.

increasingly diet is recognized as a key environmental factor that mediates the composition and metabolic function of the gastrointestinal micro- biota.indeed consumption of specific dietary ingre- dients such as fiber and prebiotics is an avenue by which the microbiota can be modulated.dietary fibers carbohydrate polymers which are neither digested nor absorbed are subjected to bacte- rial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and thus impact the composition of bacterial communities as well as microbial metabolic activities including the production of fermentative end products.

in addition intervention studies in humans have dem- onstrated that dietary fiber and whole grain intake increase gut bacterial diversity.low-fiber intake in western societies is purported to be a driver in the depletion of the human gastrointestinal micro- biota and subsequent increases in chronic non-com- municable diseases such as obesity cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and colon cancer.dietary fiberdietary fiber is a broad term and thus the impact of fiber consumption on the gastrointestinal microbiota will vary based on the type of fiber consumed.

metagenomic sequencing for example has revealed that the gastrointestinal microbiota contains approximately 150 fold more genes than that of the human genome.intriguingly human enzymes are not able to digest most fibers and prebiotics indeed less than 20 glycosidases have been identified in the human genome as enzymes involved in digestion of dietary polysaccharides.the metabolization of die- tary polysaccharides by the gastrointestinal bacteria is an example of the symbiotic relationship between the host and the microbiota.

the concentration of scfas changes throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with the highest concentrations in the proximal colon and diminishing concentrations in the distal colon the region of the gastrointestinal tract with the greatest density of microbes.among the scfas butyrate is the key energy source for colonocytes and enterocytes.

in one well-controlled feeding study individuals without ruminococcus bromii present in their microbiota had a reduced capacity to ferment the supplemented resistant starch resulting in 20-30 fermentability compared to 100 fermentability in those with ruminococcus bromii.state of the scienceclinical studies on the impact of fiber or prebiotic consumption on the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota provide examples of varied responses related to consumption of different types of fibers in the context of the complex milieu of the gastrointestinal tract .

technological and computational advances over the past decade have allowed researchers to gain a better understand- ing of the composition and function of the trillions of microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract and there is mounting evidence of an interrelationship of diet the gastrointestinal microbiota and human health.

in all animal experimentation defined diets rather than chow should be utilized to improve reproducibility of results among studies.future directionsinsights into how fiber including those considered prebiotics impacts the gastrointestinal microbiota are emerging however more research is needed to deter- mine if modulation of the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota translates to health benefits in human populations.

the moral rights of the named authors have been asserted.habitual dietary patterns are associated with the com- position of individual's gastrointestinal microbiota but significant changes in macronutrient and fiber intake also can rapidly induce changes.pronounced shifts in bacterial diversity and production of micro- bial derived fecal fermentative end products have been demonstrated in as little as 24 hours in humans switching between an agrarian diet rich in fiber  30 gramsday to a meat-based diet that was essentially devoid of fiber.dietary fiber intake is notably different across industrialized and unindustrialized parts of the world--westernized diets are characterized by their high content of animal protein fat sugar and starch and low fiber content while the diets of inhabitants of unindustrialized rural communities in african countries such as burkina faso and tanzania provide up to seven times more fiber due to increased intake of fibrous plants.

cross-sectional studies of human populations across the globe reveal that greater dietary fiber intake is associated with increased gastrointestinal microbial community diversity.preclinical studies have dem- onstrated a causal role of fermentable fiber consump- tion on microbiota diversity whereby mice fed diets that are devoid of fermentable fibers develop depleted microbiota diversity over a few generations.

consumption of prebiotics is a dietary strategy by which the gastrointestinal microbiota can be modified for health benefit.

for example short-chain fos is fer- mented within 4 hours agave inulin a highly branched fructan begins to be fermented four hours postprandially and peaks within 6 hours and chic- ory inulin a long-chain linear fructan has peak fer- mentation 8 hours postprandially.consumption of dietary fiber promotes extensive metabolic interactions among bacterial species present in the gastrointestinal microbial community.

thus dietary modulation of the human gastrointestinal microbiota via fiber or prebiotic con- sumption can result in metabolic consequences that are different from results of single culture based experimen- tations that assess bacterial growth on isolated sub- strates.

polydextrose contains both a- and b-linked 12 13 14 and 16 glucose monomers.each fiber's distinct molecular structure provides a partial explanation for the differential effects of consumption of the human gastrointestinal microbiota.conclusionshost-microbe interactions are undeniably complex with the balance of benefit and harm depending on many dietary and microbial factors.
