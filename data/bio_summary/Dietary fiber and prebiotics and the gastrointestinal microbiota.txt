Somedietary fibers can also be classified as prebiotic.Prebi- otics are defined as selectively fermented ingredients that result in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus conferring benefits upon host health.This review discusses the impact of consumption of dietary fibers and prebiotics on the gastrointestinal microbiota including the role of the ingredients' physiochemical properties and dose as well as the phenotypic responses related to the composition of the resident microbiota.The role of diet fiber and prebiotics on the gastrointestinal microbiomeThe capacity of diet to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota of humans and other mammals has been extensively studied indicating that the composition of the diet habitual dietary intake and acute dietary changes all impact the microbial communities within the gut.

Increasingly diet is recognized as a key environmental factor that mediates the composition and metabolic function of the gastrointestinal micro- biota.Indeed consumption of specific dietary ingre- dients such as fiber and prebiotics is an avenue by which the microbiota can be modulated.Dietary fibers carbohydrate polymers which are neither digested nor absorbed are subjected to bacte- rial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and thus impact the composition of bacterial communities as well as microbial metabolic activities including the production of fermentative end products.

In addition intervention studies in humans have dem- onstrated that dietary fiber and whole grain intake increase gut bacterial diversity.Low-fiber intake in Western societies is purported to be a driver in the depletion of the human gastrointestinal micro- biota and subsequent increases in chronic non-com- municable diseases such as obesity cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and colon cancer.Dietary fiberDietary fiber is a broad term and thus the impact of fiber consumption on the gastrointestinal microbiota will vary based on the type of fiber consumed.

Metagenomic sequencing for example has revealed that the gastrointestinal microbiota contains approximately 150 fold more genes than that of the human genome.Intriguingly human enzymes are not able to digest most fibers and prebiotics indeed less than 20 glycosidases have been identified in the human genome as enzymes involved in digestion of dietary polysaccharides.The metabolization of die- tary polysaccharides by the gastrointestinal bacteria is an example of the symbiotic relationship between the host and the microbiota.

The concentration of SCFAs changes throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with the highest concentrations in the proximal colon and diminishing concentrations in the distal colon the region of the gastrointestinal tract with the greatest density of microbes.Among the SCFAs butyrate is the key energy source for colonocytes and enterocytes.

In one well-controlled feeding study individuals without Ruminococcus bromii present in their microbiota had a reduced capacity to ferment the supplemented resistant starch resulting in 20-30 fermentability compared to 100 fermentability in those with Ruminococcus bromii.State of the scienceClinical studies on the impact of fiber or prebiotic consumption on the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota provide examples of varied responses related to consumption of different types of fibers in the context of the complex milieu of the gastrointestinal tract .

Technological and computational advances over the past decade have allowed researchers to gain a better understand- ing of the composition and function of the trillions of microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract and there is mounting evidence of an interrelationship of diet the gastrointestinal microbiota and human health.

In all animal experimentation defined diets rather than chow should be utilized to improve reproducibility of results among studies.Future directionsInsights into how fiber including those considered prebiotics impacts the gastrointestinal microbiota are emerging however more research is needed to deter- mine if modulation of the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota translates to health benefits in human populations.

The gastrointestinal microbiota is influenced by a number of factors including genetics host physiology age of the host disease stress etc.
