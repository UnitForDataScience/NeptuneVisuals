A The figure shows DGGE gels of the V3 hypervari- able 16S rDNA region demonstrating the microbiota's composition in the feces of rats from control Ctrl simulated microgravity HU simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 4 weeks HUE4 and simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 8 weeks HUE8.

Distribution of bacterial phylotypes A and subgroups B in the fecal samples of rats from the following groups Control Ctrl simulated microgravity HU simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 4 weeks HUE4 and simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 8 weeks HUE8.

Quantitative-polymerase chain reaction analysis measured the abundance of specific bacterial groups in the control Ctrl simulated microgravity HU simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 4 weeks HUE4 and simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 8 weeks HUE8 groups.

We thus sought to characterize the possible impact of simulated hypogravity on gut commensal microbiota and to evaluate the protective effect of estrogen on the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota in rats under simulated hypogravity.

The rats were caged separately in a room maintained at 21C and controlled lightdark cycles 1212 h. The rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 rats each as follows A control group without any treatment a simulated microgravity group tail suspension for 8 weeks group and simulated microgravity combined with estrogen for 4 weeks and 8 weeks groups estrogen was administered via the intramuscular injection of estradiol benzoate at a dose of 80 ugKg daily for first seven days then rat were euthanized at the timepoints of 4 weeks and 8 weeks respectively.

DGGE bands from the PCR products of the V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes from rat fecal samples of control simulated microgravity or simulated microgravity combined with estrogen administration groups are shown in Fig.

To evaluate whether simulated microgravity and the administration of estrogen under simulated micro- gravity affect bacterial translocation we detected serum LPS and LBP levels as surrogate markers.

Estrogen the most frequently affected hormone when under simulated microgravity regulates the permeability of the colonic mucosa barrier.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in intestinal microbiota under simulated microgravity and to investigate the protective effect of estrogen against those changes.
