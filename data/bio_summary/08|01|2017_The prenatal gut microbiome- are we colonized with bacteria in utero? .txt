Translocation of bacteria from the oral and gut microbiomes of mothers during pregnancy in ad- dition to ascension of bacteria from the vaginal microbiome may explain the presence of non-pathogenic bacteria in intra- uterine locations.

Lacto- bacillus contribute to the regulation of vaginal pH and mediate infection via the production of lactic acid.Table 1 Summary of literature identifying maternal bacteria as potential sources of infant transfer in humansAuthor referencePopulationSample sizeMethodRelevant findingsPublic dataMeconiumHu et al.

For example a low diversity the overall variety of different types of bacteria of the gut microbiome has been associated with obesity 78and inflammatory bowel disease 9 while a decrease in the abundance the relative proportions of some bacteria has been associated with type 2 diabetes 10.

For example in a study of 23 healthy newborns reduced diversity of bacteria in meconium first stool after birth was observed compared with adult stool samples with reductions in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacteria common in the adult but not infant gut microbiome 50.

In addition to vaginal ascension it is believed that endometrial uterine tissue hosts microbes that incorporate into the placenta at the time of placental implantation during pregnancy 61 sug- gesting that the foetus could be exposed to bacteria from the vaginal or uterine sources prior to delivery.In contrast to the vaginal microbiome the gut microbiome is characterized by a greater abundance and more diverse bacteria composition 6.

This contrasts with prior assumptions that ascension of bacteria from the vagina was the only plausible method of bacterial colonization in intrauterine tissues 577677.Pathogenic species of bacteria have been detected in intrauterine locations for some time in the context of infections complications or preterm delivery 78-80.

While no bacteria were foundin controls 13 of the women with pre-eclampsia harboured bacteria known to be associated with gastrointestinal infection and periodontitis 81.
