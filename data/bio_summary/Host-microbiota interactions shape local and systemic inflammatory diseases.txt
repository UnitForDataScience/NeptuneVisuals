Overall these observations demonstrate that the colonizing microbiota and host immune system have a complex dynamic and reciprocal dialogue.Members of the microbiota are recognized by the innate immune system through their conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns referred to herein as microbe-associated molecular patterns MAMPs 14 to encompass such ligands in normally non-pathogenic organisms of the microbiota.

It is clear that the gut microbiota has a strong influence on the shape and quality of the immune system and correspondingly the immune system guides the composition and localization of the microbiota.

While these have already been proposed and demonstrated as ways in which infectious pathogens such as viruses may lead to chronic autoimmune disease in humans 59 less research has elucidated mechanisms in which resident or transient microbiota can have similar roles in systemic inflammatory diseases.In certain contexts gut microbiota can exert an 'adjuvant' effect in the priming of autoreactive adaptive immune responses.

Among others proposed and emerging therapies include modification of diet 81 110 more targeted antibiotics to preserve microbiota integrity 111 supplementation of immunoregulatory metabolites administration of live biotherapeutic products 112 and fecal microbiota transplant therapy FMT 113-116.

Weill Department of Medicine Gastroenterology Division Weill Cornell Medicine New York New York USADepartment of Microbiology  Immunology Weill Cornell Medicine New York New York USAThe Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Weill Cornell Medicine New York New York USAAbstractRecent advances in understanding how the mammalian immune system and intestinal microbiota functionally interact have yielded novel insights for human health and disease.

Modern technologies to quantitatively measure specific members and functional characteristics of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract along with fundamental and emerging concepts in the field of immunology have revealed numerous ways in which host-microbiota interactions proceed beneficially neutrally or detrimentally for mammalian hosts.

Lastly we discuss translational therapies stemming from research on host-microbiota interactions that could be utilized for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.IntroductionThe human body hosts a remarkable variety 1 and quantity 2 of microorganisms collectively referred to as the microbiota.

The microbiota encompasses archaea bacteria eukarya and viruses which form a complex ecosystem thought to have co-evolved with mammalian hosts over time.

Commensal bacteria are the most well-defined member of the microbiota and amongst the various body surfaces where commensal bacteria reside the gastrointestinal GI tract contains the highest densities which are estimated to range between 1011 to 1014 cells per gram of luminal content 3.

This enormous cellular and genetic component of the human body is now well recognized to provide indispensible functions in digestion nutrition status and protection against invasive pathogens 4.The mammalian immune system is also significantly enriched in the GI tract and engages in a complex dialogue with the microbiota in order to maintain a state of homeostasis that isCORRESPONDENCE Gregory F.
