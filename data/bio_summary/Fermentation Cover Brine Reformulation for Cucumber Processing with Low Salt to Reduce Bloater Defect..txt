However supplementation of cover brines acidified with acetic acid with CaOH2 so that calcium acetate a buffer could form in solution aided in maintaining a higher end of fermentationTable 5-Characteristics of cucumber fermentations brined with CaCl2 and potassium sorbate 6.00.2 mM supplemented with calcium hydroxide 20.2 mM and NaCl.NaCl80 mM CaCl23.41 - 0.02ABC7.33 - 0.05AB82.24 - 6.34AB32.31 - 26.16A23.05 - 8.81BC19 - 13A25 mM CaCl23.49 - 0.04ABC7.58 - 0.09A94.19 - 12.36A14.41 - 8.17AB22.33 - 6.34BC47 - 2B25 mM CaCl2  690 mM NaCl25 mM CaCl2 and 345 mM NaCl3.52 - 0.07AB6.42 - 0.11B83.57 - 5.63AB1.70 - 1.08BC25.78 - 6.96AB16 - 9A3.51 - 0.11ABC7.09 - 0.15AB88.27 - 4.06AB3.04 - 3.12BC22.17 - 6.23CD25 - 1AAll jars were inoculated with L. plantarum LA0445 and supplemented with acetic acid in the form of vinegar to pH 4.7.

It is concluded that the modified cover brine formulation containing CaOH2 and NaCl enables the complete conversion of sugars decreases production of CO2 and levels of Enterobacteriaceae but insignificantly reduces bloater index.Keywords brine acidification brine reformulation buffering capacity cucumber bloater cucumber fermentation lacto- bacilliPractical Application A cucumber fermentation cover brine containing CaOH2 0.26 CaCl2 345 mM 2 NaCl and acetic acid to pH 4.7 has a functional combination of ingredients enabling a complete conversion of sugars to lactic acid with reduced production of acetic acid and CO2.

In addition NaCl is mainly used in cucumber fermentations to inhibit the undesired microbiota and indirectly select for lactic acid bacteria the central microbes in sugar conversion to organic acids.This study intended to define a functional combination of buffer capacity salt content and acid in cover brines so that bloater in- dex is minimized in the newly developed cucumber fermentation system brined with 100 mM CaCl2 and 6 mM potassium sor- bate instead of 1.03 M NaCl McFeeters and Pe'rez-D'iaz 2010 Pe'rez-D'iaz and others 2015.

Values shown are the average and standard deviations of 4 jars corresponding to duplicates with 2 independent cucumber lots.cover brine formulated with reduced CaCl2 addition of CaOH2 and the supplementation with 345 mM NaCl had the higher pH acceptable bacterial counts and acetic and lactic acids production no residual sugars and a bloater index below that observed in the absence of the NaCl.Bacterial population composition as a function of cover brine formulationFigure 7 shows data corresponding to the analysis of OTUs in cover brine samples collected from cucumber fermentations containing CaCl2 and potassium sorbate supplemented with and without CaOH2 or NaCl and acidified to pH 4.7 0.1 with acetic acid.

When studying laboratory scale cucumber fermentations acidified to pH 4.6 with lactic acid Table 3 the positive control was acidified with acetic acid to pH4.6 and the negative control was brined with 25 mM CaCl2 and 12 mM potassium sorbate to simulate conditions known to pro- mote a complete homofermentation and the inhibition of fer- mentation respectively.

Glucose and fructose at 49.4 2.2 and 51.3 3.1 mM respectively were consumed in all treat- ments except the positive control without buffer in which 2.10.4 mM fructose was detected after 14 d. Most of the lactic acid was produced before day 7 and increased about 10 mM in the following 7 d data not shown.

Although the highest amount of lactic acid produced was observed when CaCl2 was supplemented to 25 mM instead of 100 mM the same treatment enabled the production of 14 mM acetic acid Table 5.

Pilot commercial scale cucumber fermentations brined with such ingredients are to reveal the efficacy of this process ready formulation in the presence of oxygen from air in tanks as opposed to 3.8 L 1-US gal closed jars in the laboratory.IntroductionBloater defect occurring in cucumber fermentations leads to significant yield and economic losses for the pickling industry in the United States Fleming and others 1973b.
