utilization of malic acid at a slower rate en- ables the maintenance of a co2 concentration below that needed for bloating during the active fermentation period minimizing the incidence of the defect.the co2 levels in jars of cucumbers preserved by acidification was estimated at 25 of the total gas that forms in cucumber fermentations in jars table 2 and 3 figure 2 5  6. this observation is in line with those made by fleming and others 1973a concluding that the co2 level in pasteurized unfer- mented cucumber jars is about 7. thus it was confirmed that the majority of the gas formed in cucumber fermentations derives from anaerobic microbial activity.it was learned that the presence or absence of cacl2 nacl andor caoh2 in carbonated water did not impact the release of co2 to a headspace figure 4. the levels of the calcium and sodium salts tested in this experiment were not sufficient to affect the solubility of the gas under the conditions of our test at 30 degc veldhuis and etchells 1939 fleming and others 1973b 1975. however supplementation of cover brines acidified with acetic acid with caoh2 so that calcium acetate a buffer could form in solution aided in maintaining a higher end of fermentationtable 5-characteristics of cucumber fermentations brined with cacl2 and potassium sorbate 6.00.2 mm supplemented with calcium hydroxide 20.2 mm and nacl.nacl80 mm cacl23.41 - 0.02abc7.33 - 0.05ab82.24 - 6.34ab32.31 - 26.16a23.05 - 8.81bc19 - 13a25 mm cacl23.49 - 0.04abc7.58 - 0.09a94.19 - 12.36a14.41 - 8.17ab22.33 - 6.34bc47 - 2b25 mm cacl2  690 mm nacl25 mm cacl2 and 345 mm nacl3.52 - 0.07ab6.42 - 0.11b83.57 - 5.63ab1.70 - 1.08bc25.78 - 6.96ab16 - 9a3.51 - 0.11abc7.09 - 0.15ab88.27 - 4.06ab3.04 - 3.12bc22.17 - 6.23cd25 - 1aall jars were inoculated with l. plantarum la0445 and supplemented with acetic acid in the form of vinegar to ph 4.7. values shown are the average and standard deviations of 4 jars corresponding to duplicates with 2 independent cucumber lots.

lactic acid has been found to serve as an effective antimicrobial against escherichia coli o157h7 in relatively low concentrations as compared to acetic acid in cu- cumber fermentations breidt and caldwell 2011 lu and others 2011.supplementation of low salt cucumber fermentation in a bag- in-box system with caoh2 enhanced buffering capacity as ev- idence by a higher final ph and enabled the complete utilization of the sugars naturally present in the fruits mcfeeters and others 2002. cucumber fermentations supplemented with calcium ac- etate also result in pickles with enhanced texture given the role of calcium as a firming agent fleming and others 1978.acidification of cucumber fermentation cover brines not only helps suppressed the indigenous microbiota but also reduces the levels of dissolved co2 fleming 1984 mcdonald and others 1991. lower initial ph in cucumber fermentations achievable by acidification enables the presence of more hco3- species as compared to ph values above 5.2. the deriving gaseous form of co2 is thus more readily available for removal by the air purging typically applied in the commercial process at the more acidic ph fleming and others 1973b greenwood and earnshaw 1997.sodium chloride nacl in fermentation cover brines influ- ences the solubility of co2 and thus bloater index fleming and others 1973a 1975 1979. more gaseous co2 evolves from fer- mentations brined with nacl to 40 and 60 saturation than in those saturated to 20 and 30 veldhuis and etchells 1939.the sodium salt is also known to significantly reduce fermented cucumber spoilage caused by lactobacillus buchneri and other in- digenous microbiota if added to 6 in combination with a ph of 3.2 johanningsmeier and others 2012. in addition nacl is mainly used in cucumber fermentations to inhibit the undesired microbiota and indirectly select for lactic acid bacteria the central microbes in sugar conversion to organic acids.this study intended to define a functional combination of buffer capacity salt content and acid in cover brines so that bloater in- dex is minimized in the newly developed cucumber fermentation system brined with 100 mm cacl2 and 6 mm potassium sor- bate instead of 1.03 m nacl mcfeeters and pe'rez-d'iaz 2010 pe'rez-d'iaz and others 2015. although cucumber fermentations brined with cacl2 are more environmentally benign as compared to the traditional system brined with nacl a higher incidence of bloating has been associated with it in particular when size 3a and 3b cucumbers are brined mcmurtrie 2016 zhai and others 2017. zhai and others 2017 determined that the use of an al- lochthonous malic acid decarboxylase-deficient starter culture in acidified nacl free cucumber fermentations brined with cacl2 reduces bloater index but an incomplete conversion of sugars oc- curs.

the bottom panel shows amounts of co2 measured in the vacu- tainer tubes' headspace after its release from carbonated water treated with relevant combinations of the variables listed for the top panel   80 mm cacl2 and 20.2 mm caoh2   25 mm cacl2 and 20.2 mm caoh2  25 mm cacl2 20.2 mm caoh2 and 690 mm nacl and   25 mm cacl2 20.2 mm caoh2 and 345 mm nacl.

cucumbers preserved by acidi- fication in vacuum sealed jars were used to determine amountsof co2 produced from sources other than the microbial activityfigure 6-influence of cacl2 caoh2 and nacl on the release of co2 by acidification with acetic acid in cucumber fermentations amounts of co2 measured in vacutainer tubes headspace after its release from fermenta- tion cover brines   20.2 mm caoh2   25 mm cacl2   25 mm cacl2 20.2 mm caoh2 and 680 mm nacl   25 mm cacl2 20.2 mmcaoh2 and 340 mm nacl and   100 mm cacl2.

although the highest amount of lactic acid produced was observed when cacl2 was supplemented to 25 mm instead of 100 mm the same treatment enabled the production of 14 mm acetic acid table 5. supplementation of such treatment with nacl minimized the formation of acetic acid to about 2.37 0.95 mm with slightly less lactic acid formed table 5. the 12.3 0.9 mm of malic acid detected from fresh cucumber slurry were undetectable in the fermentations on day 14 data not shown likely due to the inoculation with l. plan- tarum la0445 as a starter culture able to decarboxylate the organic acid and possibly to the metabolic activity of the indigenous mi- crobiota.

it is concluded that the modified cover brine formulation containing caoh2 and nacl enables the complete conversion of sugars decreases production of co2 and levels of enterobacteriaceae but insignificantly reduces bloater index.keywords brine acidification brine reformulation buffering capacity cucumber bloater cucumber fermentation lacto- bacillipractical application a cucumber fermentation cover brine containing caoh2 0.26 cacl2 345 mm 2 nacl and acetic acid to ph 4.7 has a functional combination of ingredients enabling a complete conversion of sugars to lactic acid with reduced production of acetic acid and co2.

values shown are the average and standard deviations of 4 jars corresponding to duplicates with 2 independent cucumber lots.cover brine formulated with reduced cacl2 addition of caoh2 and the supplementation with 345 mm nacl had the higher ph acceptable bacterial counts and acetic and lactic acids production no residual sugars and a bloater index below that observed in the absence of the nacl.bacterial population composition as a function of cover brine formulationfigure 7 shows data corresponding to the analysis of otus in cover brine samples collected from cucumber fermentations containing cacl2 and potassium sorbate supplemented with and without caoh2 or nacl and acidified to ph 4.7 0.1 with acetic acid.

levels not connected by the same letter are significantly different.evaluation of the release of co2 from carbonated water as a function of acidification with lactic aceticand phosphoric acidsacidification with any of the acids induced an increment in co2 in the headspace from 19.04 0.22 mg100 ml to a maximum of 26.11 6.39 mg100 ml figure 3. although no significant differences were detected among the 3 acids figure 3 shows that increasing amounts of lactic and phosphoric acids in the system induced a greater proportion of the co2 in the carbonated water to be displaced to the headspace as compared to acetic acid.influence of caoh2 and nacl on the release of co2 from carbonated watertreatments containing caoh2 had a higher final ph at 3.400.10 after adding 555 mm acetic acid presumably due to the for- mation of calcium acetate a buffer table 5. addition of calcium derivatives to the carbonated water resulted in no significant dif- ferences in the amounts of co2 measured from the headspace of vacutainer tubes indicating such compounds are not affecting the release of the gas figure 4. no significant differences in the con- centrations of the evolving gas were observed when adding from 128 to 555 mm acetic acid as well data not shown.release of co2 and bloater index in cucumber fermentation brined with cacl2 and potassium sorbate acidified with lactic acid to ph 4.6no significant differences were found in the end of fermentation ph lactobacilli colony counts co2 amounts and bloater index among treatments table 3. co2 levels in the negative control jars in which the cucumbers were subjected to preservation by acidification without fermentation were approximately 30 of that detected in the fermenting jars table 3 confirming that most of the gas produced derives from microbial activity instead of tissue respiration.

when studying laboratory scale cucumber fermentations acidified to ph 4.6 with lactic acid table 3 the positive control was acidified with acetic acid to ph4.6 and the negative control was brined with 25 mm cacl2 and 12 mm potassium sorbate to simulate conditions known to pro- mote a complete homofermentation and the inhibition of fer- mentation respectively.

microbial growth peaked by day 3 in all treatments with no sig- nificant differences table 5. glucose and fructose at 49.4 2.2 and 51.3 3.1 mm respectively were consumed in all treat- ments except the positive control without buffer in which 2.10.4 mm fructose was detected after 14 d. most of the lactic acid was produced before day 7 and increased about 10 mm in the following 7 d data not shown.

the impact of the most effective combination of supplements in cucumber fermentation brines to reduce bloater index on the indigenous microbiota was also eval- uated using metagenetics.materials and methodsmonitoring tissue respiration in acidified cucumbers without fermentationa cucumber preservation method by acidification developed by pe'rez-d'iaz and mcfeeters 2008 was applied to determine the amount of co2 formed from respiration of the vegetative tissue after brining.

the impact of the experimental vari- ables supplementation with caoh2 nacl and acids in the microbiota of cucumber fermentations was analyzed by determin- ing the relative abundance of otus in fermentation cover brine samples.in this study it was possible to determine that acidification with lactic acetic or phosphoric acids aided in releasing co2 to a headspace from carbonated water and preservation or fermenta- tion cover brines in similar ways tables 2-4 figure 2 3 and 5. buffered and acidified fermentations yielded a reduction in the formation of co2 and bloater index table 5. utilization of a malic acid decarboxylase deficient starter culture in combination with acidification in low salt cucumber fermentations yielded a lower bloater index under the conditions of this study table 4. mcfeeters and others 1984 showed that the inability of a l. plantarum starter culture to decarboxylate the malic acid inherently present in cucumbers mcfeeters and others 1982 aided in re- ducing bloater incidence by diminishing the total levels of co2 in the system and maintaining them below the concentration needed to induce bloating.

approximately 59 of total co2 was produced prior to day 3 fluctuating from 14.55 5.14 mg 100 ml on day 3 to 24.67 7.05 mg 100 ml on day 14 figure 5. the negative control in which wild fer- mentations proceeded produced significantly more co2 than all other treatments table 4 and figure 5. fermentations inoculated with l. plantarum fs965 in the absence of acidification positive control also produced significantly more co2 than the 2 exper- imental treatments in which the brines were acidified table 4 and figure 5. the combination of a starter culture with cover brine acidification generated a reduction in the co2 measured in particular when l. plantarum fs965 was used as a starter culture table 4 and figure 5.table 3-characteristics of laboratory scale cucumber fermentations brined with cacl2 potassium sorbate 6.0 - 0.2 mm and caoh2 acidified to ph 4.6 - 0.1 with lactic acid.co2 mg  100 ml of cover brine3.39 - 0.03b7.88 - 0.18a7.14 - 2.24a13.96 - 4.04a20.91 - 4.54ab44 - 32avalues shown represent averages and standard deviations of 4 runs from duplicate trials with different lots of cucumbers.
