A meta-analysis revealed significant group differences for LFD compared with other diets with regard to gastrointestinal symptoms SMD 14 -0.62 95 CI 14 -0.93 to-0.31 P 14 0.0001 abdominal pain SMD 14 -0.50 95 CI 14 -0.77 to -0.22 P 14 0.008 and health-related quality of life SMD 14 0.36 95 CI 14 0.10-0.62 P 14 0.007.

The magnitude of the heterogeneity was categorized as I2 14 0 to 25 low heterogeneity I2 14 26 to50 moderate heterogeneity I2 14 51 to 75 substantial heterogeneity and I2 14 76 to 100 considerable heterogeneity .

Patients in all RCTs were diagnosed with IBS according to Rome-III criteria including subtypes with predominant symptoms of either diarrhea IBS-D or constipation IBS-C mixedalternating symptoms IBS-MA or of unspecified type IBS-U except for two RCTs that only included IBS-D andor symptoms of bloating .

One RCT was excluded becauseit used the low FODMAP dietonly to wash out symptoms in the initial stage of the investigation on the effects of diets that were high or low in gluten .

High risk also had to be considered for other bias in two studies .Analysis of overall effectThe results of the meta-analysis are displayed in .Primary outcomesThe meta-analysis revealed significant group differences for LFD compared with any control for GI symptoms SMD 0.62 95 CI 0.93 to 0.31 P 0.0001 heterogeneity I 77c229.95 P0.0004 and abdominal pain SMD0.5095 CI0.77 to 0.22 P0.008 heterogeneity I2 63c2 19.07 P0.0004.Although one study found no difference between patients with IBS-D and patients with IBS-C  improvements in IBS symptoms were less for patients with IBS-C in two studies .

Therefore the mechanism behind the low FODMAP diet lies in the reduction of the fermentable load and the liquid volume that is delivered to the colon to reduce gas production and luminal distension that is associated with GI symptom relief in patients with IBS .The primary purpose of this study is to review and meta- analyze the effectiveness of such a diet in the treatment of functional GI symptoms in patients with IBS.
