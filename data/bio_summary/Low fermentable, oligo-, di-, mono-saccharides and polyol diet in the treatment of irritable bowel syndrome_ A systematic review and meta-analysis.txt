the findings of our review are also in line with a descriptive review on lfd for ibs that considered 40 articles 31 original studies and nine reviews and concluded that the lfd should be the first dietary approach in patients with ibs because it not only improves symptoms but also provides relative ease of implementation .external and internal validityall studies used the rome criteria as a standard for eligi- bility thus standardizing the results.

cohen's categories were used to evaluate the magnitude of the overall effect size as follows smd of 0.2 to 0.5 small effect size smd of 0.5 to 0.8 medium effect size and smd greater than 0.8 large effect size.assessment of heterogeneitythe i2 statistics a measure of how much variance between studies can be attributed to differences between studies rather than chance was used to analyze the statistical heterogeneity between the studies.

high risk also had to be considered for other bias in two studies .analysis of overall effectthe results of the meta-analysis are displayed in .primary outcomesthe meta-analysis revealed significant group differences for lfd compared with any control for gi symptoms smd 0.62 95 ci 0.93 to 0.31 p 0.0001 heterogeneity i 77c229.95 p0.0004 and abdominal pain smd0.5095 ci0.77 to 0.22 p0.008 heterogeneity i2 63c2 19.07 p0.0004.although one study found no difference between patients with ibs-d and patients with ibs-c  improvements in ibs symptoms were less for patients with ibs-c in two studies .

three rcts compared lfd with a habitual diet two rcts provided all meals and compared lfd with a western diet one rct each compared lfd with a diet high in fodmaps or a sham diet and two rcts compared with other diet recommendations for ibs.

given the low power of this test when only few studies or studies with a low sample size are included in a meta-analysis a p value  a0.10 was regarded as significant heterogeneity .fig.

patients were also excluded if on a paleolithic or gluten-free diet low fodmap or low carbohydrate diet.intervention characteristicstwo rcts compared lfd with a habitual diet  one with a diet that is generally recommended for patients with ibs  and two provided all meals and compared lfd with a western diet americanaustralian .

one rct measured lfd up to the usual diet recommendations for patients with ibs  and one rct compared the lfd with the modified guidelines from the national institute for health and care excellence .
