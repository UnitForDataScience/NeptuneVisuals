Thus characterizing skin microbiome turnover among individual communities throughout the range of the eastern hellbendermay benefit current conservation approaches by providing an additional guide for translocations.We implemented culture-independent microbiome characterization methods to identify cutaneous bacterial communities on the skin of eastern hellbenders and river water.

We observed variation among hellbender populations in skin microbial community diversity and proportion of shared operational taxonomic units OTUs between animal and river water communities.

Future work should focus on investigating forces shaping microbiome structure in eastern hellbenders examining functional variation among populations and evaluating effectiveness of microbiome management recommendations.Keywords community ecology host-associated bacteria metacommunity amphibian conservation range-wideINTRODUCTIONIn animal and plant systems symbiont microbes provide important functional services to host physiological processes including immune system activation metabolic regulation energy uptake tissue differentiation and pathogen defense        .

A previous study evaluated the microbiome communities between the two hellbender subspecies and characterized divergence in skin communities of both populations  .

We also evaluated metacommunity structure of hellbender skin communities to quantify species turnover among individuals.

We noted significant correlations between hellbender sample ordination scores and elevationFIGURE 3  Box-plot distributions of alpha diversity values A- Observed OTUs B- Shannon Diversity Index for cutaneous microbial communities from eastern hellbenders at different localities in the subspecies' range.

Thus incorporating functional characterization in future assessments of hellbender skin will be useful to evaluate how OTU turnover influences important functional traits such as pathogen defenseor community resistance to anthropogenic activities   .Skin Community Compositional DifferencesImplementing a phylogenetic based dissimilarity index to characterize beta diversity among hellbender skin communities allowed us to assess bacterial lineage turnover.

We then tested for differences in skin community diversity and the proportion of shared microbes between water and skin communities among populations.
