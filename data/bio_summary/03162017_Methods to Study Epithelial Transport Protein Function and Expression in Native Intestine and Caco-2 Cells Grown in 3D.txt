polarity differentiation and tight junction integrity are critical for the study of the functionality of epithelial transport systems.With respect to models the typical cell lines used currently in intestinal epithelial transport research are Caco-2 a model of fully differentiated absorptive small intestinal epithelial cells and T84 cells or HT-29 subclones models of crypt-derived large intestinal epithelial cells1.

Taking into consideration the challenges in the field with respect to models and the measurement of transport function we demonstrate here a protocol to grow Caco-2 cells in 3D and describe the use of an Ussing chamber as an effective approach to measure serotonin transport such as in intact polarized intestinal epithelia.Correspondence to Ravinder K.

In addition we describe methods to study SERT function and regulation by TGF-b1 a pleiotropic cytokine in small intestinal mucosa by utilizing an Ussing chamber technique.ProtocolStudy of Intestinal Transporters in a 3D Culture System of Caco-2 Growing 3D Caco-2 Cell Culture on a Gelatinous Protein MixtureThaw growth factor reduced gelatinous protein mixture on ice for 8 h or ON at 4 degC.

SERT Protein Expression in Caco-2 Cells Grown in 2D and 3DLysates from Caco-2 cells cultured on a plastic support and Caco-2 3D spheres were resolved by SDS-PAGE blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed with the SERT antibody and GAPDH.

Thus ECM-based natural hydrogels containing common components such as laminin collagen IV and heparin sulfate proteoglycan are extensively used for the generation of 3D cell cultures16.The protocol described here demonstrates the suitability of 3D Caco-2 cells grown in gelatinous protein mixture an ECM-based natural hydrogel extracted from Engelbreth- Holm-Swarm EHS mouse tumors for epithelial transport research.

However to mimic the physiological organization of intestinal epithelial cells there has been considerable interest in the development of a Caco-2 culture in 3D.

In all cases the magnitude of the Gt or Rt can be a real-time indicator of viability and can be useful in discriminating between the specific and nonspecific effects of tested reagents.In summary the methods described here can facilitate our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the function and regulation of epithelial transporters inAnabazhagan et al.Page 9healthy and diseased conditions such as intestinal inflammation infectious diarrhea malabsorption or metabolic disorders.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Mr. Christopher Manzella MDPhD student in the RKG laboratory for helping to edit and proofread our manuscript.ReferencesSimon-Assmann P Turck N Sidhoum-Jenny M Gradwohl G Kedinger M. In vitro models of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.

The 3D Caco-2 cysts at 10 - 12 days show polarity and more differentiation than 2D Caco-2 cells grown on transwells17 unpublished observations.

Further to minimize the influence of the intrinsic neuromuscular system seromuscular stripping of intestinal mucosa can be performed to investigate the regulation of transporters in the epithelium8.We demonstrate that Caco-2 cells grown in 3D on gelatinous protein form a hollow lumen expressing distinct apical and basolateral markers.

We show that Caco-2 cells in 3D can be used to study epithelial transporters.
