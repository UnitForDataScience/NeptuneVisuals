Adv Nutr 20178240-52.Keywords nonalcoholic fatty liver disease gut microbiota diet NAFLD NASH probioticsIntroductionNonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD6 is the most com- mon cause of chronic liver diseases in the world 1.

Con- sidering that the anatomy of the liver facilitates a close inter- action between the liver and gut microbiome it is possible that gut microbial metabolites and circulating byproducts influence liver function.

On the other hand through their receptor GPR43 and other pathways they reduce gut permeability and invasion of bacterial pro- ducts through the portal vein and liver and thus protect the liver from the ensuing damaging inflammation which then results in downregulation of insulin signaling in adi- pose tissue thereby decreasing fat accumulation 80.

Genetics of alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

J Nutr Biochem 200920657-62.Askari F Rashidkhani B Hekmatdoost A. Cinnamon may have therapeutic benefits on lipid profile liver enzymes insulin resistance and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients.

Due to the close anatomic and functional association between the intestinal lumen and the liver through the portal system it is speculated that the gut microbiome may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

Furthermore diet which can modulate the gut microbiome and several metabolic pathways involved in NAFLD development shows a potential tripartite relation between the gut diet and the liver.

NAFLD is defined as a liver pathologic spectrum which is initiated by steatosis that may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepati- tis NASH.

In addition to genetic background environmental factors such as diet and the intestinal microbiome should be consid- ered critical factors in the development of NAFLD 6 7.The gut microbiome the trillions of microbes living in the gut may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases 8 9.
