according to some authors a greater variabil- ity in intestinal bacterial composition may reflect a greater resistance to pathogen invasion.intestinal bacterial diver- sity appears to confer resilience and consequently greater stability of the bacterial ecosystem.however the higher quantification of a bacterial phylum is not necessarily asso- ciated with a greater number or diversity of colonizing bacterial genera and species.

quando comparadas aquelas sem sobrecrescimento bacteriano no intestino delgado 377 vs. 103 p  0002. maior contagem de eubacterias totais p  0014 e firmicutes p  0038 foi observada nas criancas sem sobrecrescimento bacteriano no intestino delgado enquanto que as criancas com sobrecrescimento bacteriano no intestino delgado apresentaram maior contagem de salmonella p  0002.conclusao nas criancas com diagnostico de sobrecrescimento bacteriano no intestino delgado verificaram-se menores valores de estatura para idade e de hemoglobina.

in the presence of sibo the production of these gases can also be observed in the smallfecal microbiota and bacterial overgrowth3intestine through the action of contaminating bacteria.in this context a study carried out by the present research groupin children exposed to poor living conditions found that those diagnosed with sibo had a higher fermentation potential not only in the small intestine but also in the colon suggesting a situation of dysbiosis throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract in the presence of this clinical condition.considering that the intestinal microbiota composition can be influenced by the environment and the living condi- tions to which the individual is exposedand the negative consequences of the environmental enteric dysfunction in childhoodthe present study aimed to analyze the fecal microbiota composition of children with and without sibo living in an urban slum in brazil as well as to investigate the occurrence of growth deficit and anemia in these children.methodsdesignthis was a cross-sectional study carried out in the city of osasco metropolitan region of sao paulo brazil.

however these data need to be analyzed with caution due to the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the intestinal and systemic inflam- matory response.the greater susceptibility of children living in slums to nutritional disorders has been already well demonstrated in the literature.however the present findings also indi- cate a higher frequency of low nutritional stature in sibo patients when compared to those without sibo when both groups are exposed to the same risk factors.a study carried out in bangladesh with 90 2-year-old chil- dren living in poverty found that the main factor associated with sibo was the reduction in the ha z-score in compari- son to the birth parameters regardless of whether children had or not recent or frequent diarrheal disease.another result that similar to short stature reinforces the occurrence of a malabsorption syndrome was the lower mean levels of hemoglobin found in the group of children with sibo.

when compared to those without small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 37.7 vs. 10.3p  0.002. higher counts of total eubacteria p  0.014 and firmicutes p  0.038 were observed in children without small intestinal bacterial overgrowth however a higher count of salmonella p  0.002 was found in children with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

the quantifi- cation of bacterial phyla genera and species according to the presence or absence of sibo is presented in discussionin the present study differences were observed in the fecal microbiota composition of children with sibo living in an urban slum more precisely higher frequency and counts of salmonella spp.

and lower counts of firmicutes and total eubacteria were observed in children with sibo when com- pared to those without it.in a previous study carried out by the present research team a finding that motivated the study of the fecal micro- biota of children exposed to poverty and diagnosed with sibo was a differentiated pattern of fermentation in the colon characterized by the higher production of hydrogen in the breath test.this result led to the assumption that individuals with sibo possibly have a situation of dysbio- sis in the different intestinal segments and not only in the small intestine.

conversely the character- ization of sibo is usually associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in bacterial genera and species in the small intestine.the bacteria involved in the occurrence of sibo are mainly gram-negative which have lipopolysaccharide lps in their cell membranes.

similarly the higher quantifi- cation of total eubacteria in the group of children with sibo can be reflect a higher bacterial concentration.the genetic variability of the microorganisms that make up the microbiota of individuals with and without sibo could be identified with the use of new generation sequencing technologies which may be the subject of future stud- ies.

however based on the hypothesis that individuals suscep- tible to bacterial contamination by potentially pathogenic species may present serious damage in their health and nutrition it is necessary to emphasize the importance of effective public policies for the improvement of housing conditions and basic sanitation of the vulnerable popula- tion thus contributing to the eradication of environmental enteropathy.fundingfundacao de amparo a pesquisa do estado de sao paulo fapesp.conflicts of interestthe authors declare no conflicts of interest.references- - -- -- - - -- - - - - -- - -- - -8mello cs et al.
