c A wide range of early-stage data analysis choices can strongly affect microbial community data analysis including the quality control of the raw data the normalization of the raw data choice of host and microbial features to extract and algorithms to profile them.

Research challenges also arise however at the intersection of microbial ecology and molecular epidemiology as population-scale microbiome study designs and methods that adequately account for human variability environmental exposures and technical reproducibility are also still in the early stages of devel- opment -Existing technologies for population-scale microbiome studies share many similarities with molecular epidemiology techniques for human gene expression and genome-wide association studies Human-associated microbial communities are most often profiled in terms of their com- position for example by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA genes to yield phylogenetic or taxonomic profiles abbreviated here as 16S amplicon profiling 16S and other amplicon-based technologies are limited in their phylogenetic ranges for example 16S rRNA gene studies primarily target bacteria with some crossover whereas 18S or internal transcribed spacer ITS studies typically target fungi.

The first experimental design considerations around sampling therefore include accessibility degree of human orother 'contaminant' nucleotides and biomass.At one extreme stool is well-suited for metagenomics and metatranscriptomics because it is rarely subject to biomass limitations and easily yields high quantities of microbial RNA and DNA with low host contamination up to 75 of fecal mass is estimated to be bacterial By contrast it is challenging to achieve DNA or RNA yields from skin swabs in the quantities required for typical shotgun sequencing library preparation.Finally every human microbiome sample will contain some human DNA.

by mapping metagenomic sequences to that of reference and calling SNVs  or intrinsically by aligning sequences directly from one or more meta- genomes and identifying SNVs among them Finally as microbial strains often differ dramatically in theircarriage of different core or pangenome elements or genomic islands unlike most populations within eukaryote species  strains can also be identified by the presence or absence of one or more genes or gen- omic regions This requires less sequencing depth and is thus sensitive to less abundant members of a community but can be more susceptible to noise and unable to delineate closely related strains.Although strain identification characterization and phylogenetics are well-developed for microbial isolates the use of culture-independent amplicon or meta- genomic sequence data to perform such tasks is still in its infancy and can suffer from a variety of drawbacks.

Finally human population studies provide a starting point for the follow-up characterization of microbial biochemical mechanisms which can integrate characterization tech- niques such as culture-based physiology microbial metabol- ism co-culture and interactions.

Franzosa12 Tommi Vatanen2 Xochitl C. Morgan3 and Curtis Huttenhower12IntroductionPopulation-scale studies of the human microbiome now have at their disposal a remarkable range of culture- independent and other molecular and cellular biology technologies but the identification of elements of the microbiome that are functionally important for human health remains challenging.

Community metatranscrip- tomics metabolomics and metaproteomics techniques are emerging to link nucleotide sequence-based profiles to their bioactive products   as are complementary tech- nologies such as immunoglobulin A gene sequencing IgA-seq immunoprofiling and human cell screening techniques to jointly profile microbial and human host ac- tivities   .

Considerations for the collection of human microbiome specimensThe microbial ecology of body sites and niches across the human body is incredibly diverse and studies of these different environments typically call for multiple different sample collection and storage methods.
