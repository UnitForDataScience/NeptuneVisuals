research challenges also arise however at the intersection of microbial ecology and molecular epidemiology as population-scale microbiome study designs and methods that adequately account for human variability environmental exposures and technical reproducibility are also still in the early stages of devel- opment -existing technologies for population-scale microbiome studies share many similarities with molecular epidemiology techniques for human gene expression and genome-wide association studies human-associated microbial communities are most often profiled in terms of their com- position for example by sequencing the 16s ribosomal rna rrna genes to yield phylogenetic or taxonomic profiles abbreviated here as 16s amplicon profiling 16s and other amplicon-based technologies are limited in their phylogenetic ranges for example 16s rrna gene studies primarily target bacteria with some crossover whereas 18s or internal transcribed spacer its studies typically target fungi.

many current culture-independent tools profile microbial community membership by delineating genera or species but microbial epidemiologists have long recognized that not all strains within a species are equally functional particularly with respect to patho- genicity.

orf open reading framewithin a community or between community members and reference genomes or identifying variable regions such as gained or lost genomic elements table community snv identification like microbial isolate or human genetic profiling requires sufficiently deep cover- age typically 10x or more of every microbial strain to be differentiated but can delineate closely related strains very precisely.

by mapping metagenomic sequences to that of reference and calling snvs  or intrinsically by aligning sequences directly from one or more meta- genomes and identifying snvs among them finally as microbial strains often differ dramatically in theircarriage of different core or pangenome elements or genomic islands unlike most populations within eukaryote species  strains can also be identified by the presence or absence of one or more genes or gen- omic regions this requires less sequencing depth and is thus sensitive to less abundant members of a community but can be more susceptible to noise and unable to delineate closely related strains.although strain identification characterization and phylogenetics are well-developed for microbial isolates the use of culture-independent amplicon or meta- genomic sequence data to perform such tasks is still in its infancy and can suffer from a variety of drawbacks.

tens to hundreds of gigabases to differentiate secondary strains except when only one or a few organisms dominate finally as in other areas of microbial genomics metagenomic strain identi- fication is sensitive to the definition of a 'strain' which can vary from clonality at all genomic loci possibly in- cluding plasmids clonality at all sequenced locations possibly only within an amplified region or allowing some non-zero degree of nucleotide-level divergence .metatranscriptomics enables characterization of context-specific dynamic biomolecular activity in microbial communitiestaxonomic profiling at any level of resolution is in- creasingly accompanied by functional profiling--pairing a community's organismal makeup with its gene andorpathway catalog metagenomic dna sequencing however yields information only regarding the commu- nity's functional potential--which organisms at what abundances might be able to carry out which biological processes and not necessarily which genes are being transcribed under current conditions.

c a wide range of early-stage data analysis choices can strongly affect microbial community data analysis including the quality control of the raw data the normalization of the raw data choice of host and microbial features to extract and algorithms to profile them.

when possible the meta-analysis of host and microbial features with respect to shared phenotypes of interest can allow more confidence in prioritizing microbial taxa gene products or small molecules that have statistically significant roles in disease relative to covariates.

one avenue of research aimstable 3 tools for feature-wise differential abundance analysis in microbial community taxonomic profilescss cumulative sum scaling rle relative log expression tmm trimmed mean by m-value tss total-sum scalingto capture the correlation among repeated measurements by using random effects     other studies have relied on dynamical system or probabilistic spline modeling  of microbiome time-series data to study the temporal dynamics and stability of microbial ecosystems.

to identify microbial associa- tions with an outcome variable supervised analysis  provides the resolution needed to identify patterns that might not be captured by the single strongest axis of vari- ation as well as rigorous statistically justified quantifica- tion of such associations.to this end several families of omnibus test assess whether overall patterns of microbial variation in a community associate with covariates by some signifi- cance model e.g.

for single-feature differential abundance analysis study-specific effects may alternatively be addressed by adopting a unified model with identi- cally defined effect sizes which can then be compared and combined across studies using existing proper statistical methods for example mixed-effects models another promising direction is high- dimensional predictive modeling techniques that is using subjects' microbial profiles as predictors for out- comes of interests such as random forests neural net- works and support vector machines which are often successful in reproducibly predicting phenotype across multiple cohorts  0. the results obtained to date suggest avenues by which discriminative machine-learningmodels can be applied in microbial community settings to robustly associate features across multiple studies with outcomes of interest.conclusionslike existing molecular epidemiology technologies the translation of population studies of the human microbiome will require complex processes in order to achieve observa- tional discovery reproducibility across cohorts and mech- anistic validation typically in models or in vitro.

finally human population studies provide a starting point for the follow-up characterization of microbial biochemical mechanisms which can integrate characterization tech- niques such as culture-based physiology microbial metabol- ism co-culture and interactions.

although highly sensitive these technologies also suf- fer from contamination amplification and extraction biases a subset of these issues are shared by whole- community shotgun metagenomic sequencing approaches which can further describe the functional genetic potential of the entire community but do not tell us what portion of this genetic potential is actively transcribed or translated in any particular environment 5. community metatranscrip- tomics metabolomics and metaproteomics techniques are emerging to link nucleotide sequence-based profiles to their bioactive products   as are complementary tech- nologies such as immunoglobulin a gene sequencing iga-seq immunoprofiling and human cell screening techniques to jointly profile microbial and human host ac- tivities   .
