Activation of Notch pathway could stimulate ISCs dif- ferentiation into absorptive cell lineages while cis-inhibition of Notch directs ISCs toward secretory lineage cells such as goblet cells enteroendocrine cells Paneth cells or tuft cells .

Epithelial differentiation into goblet cells was increased upon inhibiting the Notch signaling in the intestine and the Notch signaling could also be modulated by TLR4  .Within the intestinal crypt Lgr5 stem cells constitutively express much higher levels of the cytosolic innate immune sensor Nod2 than do Paneth cells .

Studies have shown that the Lgr  crypt base columnar cells CBC cells are rapidly dividing ISCs which is necessary for gut renewal .

The4 LRCs are activated during stress of injury and subsequently produce intestinal progenitor cells to replace the damaged intes- tinal cells .

The defects in ISCs differentiation to Paneth cells or goblet cells are always observed in IBD which results in luminal microbe invasion of the mucosa and inflammation .

S. Typhimurium infects and damages the intestinal epithelial then promotes migration of neutrophils that produce ROS which facilitate conversion of S O2- gener-The effect of the intestinal Microbiota on Paneth CellsPaneth cells located at the base of the crypts in the small intestine are highly specialized secretory cells.

Salmonella infectioncould stimulate the expansion of the Paneth cells population withincreased expression of MyD88 in Paneth cells which is sufficient to limit Salmonella penetration across the mucosal barrier  .

Recent study also demonstrated that Paneth cells are impor- tant for the differentiation and proliferation of ISCs which are interspersed between Paneth cells .

However the complete loss of Paneth cells did not damage the intestinal crypt structure and main- tain the physiological proliferation of ISCs in vivo which implied the underlying mucosal cells may act as a potential ISCs niche .
