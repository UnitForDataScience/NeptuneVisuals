noitall-most good evening abi it is always a plea- sure to be here.ms.

noitall-most yes abi this is a very curious and unexpected finding by the groups of professor scarlett havabotoxy and dr. gotthilf von pickelface at the euro- pean centre for clinical dermatology in slovenia that was published in natural science.the background to the story is in essence when out- side temperatures plummet and we turn up the central heating of our houses and workplaces the exposed parts of our body - primarily our faces - are subjected to two environmental insults namely cold often exacer- bated by a chill factor and low humidity.

noitall-most well previously it was assumed that the so-called winter rosy face or wrf which ranges from a bit of flakiness to the uncooked burger patty ap- pearance and rosacea was due to drynesscold- induced damage of the skin and a resulting inflammatory reaction that causes the typical symptoms.ms.

noitall-most yes abi but these treat the symptoms not the cause so only give temporary relief.

noitall-most oh sorry a problem with microbiome sequencing is the variation in population sizes of differ- ent organisms.

noitall-most no that is an exaggeration keep in mind that when it is active it does no harm and it's only when it seeks to get out of the cold more or less like wedo when winter arrives does it cause a problem and then only passively since it is effectively in hibernation.ms.

noitall-most ali it is a bit too early to say but we can be optimistic.

noitall-most yes i perfectly agree.
