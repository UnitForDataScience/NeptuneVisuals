plasma and saliva metabolites were analyzed using lc-ms as previously described a pre-specified protein panel was run on the somalogic platform the microbiomic analysis in saliva and from buccal and rectal swabs was conducted as established earlier and in-house qpcr was used for expression analysis of a small selected panel of genes.a triaxial actigraph device wactisleep-bt recorded accelerometer and light sensor data with subsequent wear time analysis and sleep scoring in actilife 6.0 software.

in addition to standard descriptive statistics we applied permutation tests principal component analysis principal coordinate analysis circadian multiresolution analyses cosinor method ingenuity pathway analysis variance correlation analysis and a time-versus-subject contribution to var- iance analysis.resultswe successfully integrated and analyzed this multidimensional dataset roughly 2.2 million data points collected from 6 healthy volunteers over the course of 4 months including two 48-hour sessions of additional deep pheno- typing fig.

such deep phenotypic characterization will provide a comparator for investigation of chronobiomic diver- gence of potential mechanistic and therapeutic value in syndromes of time dependent disease expression such as non-dipping hypertension nocturnal asthma and depression.referencescurtis a. m.  fitzgerald g. a. central and peripheral clocks in cardiovascular and metabolic function.

.in summary we were able to detect internally consistent time dependent patterns in blood pressure heart rate cortisol activity communication mobility and light consistent with the physiological and behavioral expec- tations for this cohort in the natural setting under the conditions of this experiment.next we were interested to assess the comparative contributions of time the signal and inter-subject behav- ioral differences the noise to variability in our datasets.

time-of-day dependent differences in metabolite proteingene levels are displayed selecting the top-ranked candidates per non-parametric statistical test i aggregated by morningevening for all n 6 subjects left column ii aggregated by time point 0 h - morning 12 h - evening 24 h - morning 36 h - evening 48 h - morning for all n 6 subjects second left column andiii individual time series from session 1 red and session 2 blue for each subject 6 columns to the right.

time-of-day dependent differences in the relative fraction of bacterial genera are displayed i aggregated by morningevening for all n 6 subjects left column ii aggregated by time point 0 h - morning 12 h - evening 24 h - morning 36 h - evening 48 h - morning for alln 6 subjects second left column and iii individual time series from session 1 red and session 2 blue for each subject 6 columns to the right.

.to parse the relative contributions of time and inter-subject differences to variability in the datasets we con- ducted a principal component analysis figure s4.

in an effort to explore which disease categories might be subject to time dependent oscillations we performed a time-specific pathway analysis of the metabolome and the proteome.

b the observation time for the biosensor-derived data was a total of four months with two 48-hour sessions session 1  2 scheduled two weeks apart to extend the biosensor platform by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring abpm and timestamped dietary intake smartintake as well as by collection of timed biospecimens for multiomics analysis at 12-hour intervals.accelerometers that is axes 1 2 and 3 to measure acceleration in three directions correlate highly with each other as expected e.g.
