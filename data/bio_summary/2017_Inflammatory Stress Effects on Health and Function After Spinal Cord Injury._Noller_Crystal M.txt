However prolonged inflammation is now known to be associated witha myriad of disorders that include type 2 diabetes andall-causecardiovasculardiseases.Thesechronic inflammatory disorders may not be triggered by the conventional progenitors of infection and injury but rather caused by sustained tissue malfunction and persistent activation of endocrine and paracrine signaling which ultimately block reestablishment of preinjury tissue function and systemic homeostasis.Spinal cord injury SCI is a condition known to be characterized by extensive pro-inflammatory activity.1 Acute inflammation occurs at the time of injury but residual inflammation can persist beyond the initial insult indefinitely.2 Chronic inflammation also results from common secondary complications of SCI eg pulmonary infections urinary tract infections and pressure ulcers.134 Thus far SCI research has primarily focused on modulating acute inflammation occurring within the spinal cord to decrease secondary damageCorresponding author Mark S.

A recent clinical trial found that targeting inflammation improved depression after SCI.43 Considering the interrelated nature of inflammation with pain and depression40-42 and the impact these conditions have on health and mortality risk after injury1544 chronic inflammation may be a legitimate target in the all-inclusive management of SCI.Acute infectionsAcute infections of the lungs urinary tract and pressure ulcers are among the most common of secondary medical complications occurring after SCI13445-47 represent the third highest source of all-cause mortality after injury45 and can even impact functional neurological recovery.48Respiratory complications affect approximately 30 to 100 of persons with SCI depending on the level of injury.49-51 Pneumonia is one of the primary risk factors for increased mortality after210Topics in spinal cord injury rehabiliTaTionsummer 2017SCI52 and is the primary cause of death for both the acute and chronic phases of SCI.43449 It is known that the presence of systemic inflammation worsens respiratory function and that irrespective of the level or completeness of injury higher levels of nonspecific acute phase reactant CRP and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 are associated with reduced pulmonary function after SCI.53The presence of symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria poses risks for both acute and chronic inflammation.

Indeed this approach has been suggested for other neurological conditions such as stroke9394 and is a significant component of recently described interventions for persons with SCI.83Influence of bacteria and the microbiomeRecent research on the gut microbiome has uncovered a novel source of inflammation that may be especially relevant in addressing cardiometabolic risk.95 The role of the gut microbiome in the development of metabolic syndrome has been described and involves several putative mechanisms including bacterial-derived lipopolysaccharides LPS and short-chain fatty acids produced during fermentation of dietary polysaccharides.95LPS found in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is a highly inflammatory stimulant96 these bacterial wall components can induce metabolic endotoxemia a low-grade inflammatory state that can lead to metabolic syndrome.959798 Elevated LPS levels have been associated with obesity insulin resistance diabetes and cardiovascular disease.9798 Typically the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier restricts the passage of resident bacteria however breakdown of this barrier can lead to bacterial translocation.99 Bacterial translocation has been shown to occur within 7 days after SCI in rodents.100101 If bacterial translocation also occurs and persists in humans it could explain one source of the nonspecific inflammation commonly observed after injury.1 It may also explain part of the elevated risk for cardiometabolic disorders in this population.816 Furthermore if the bacteria are predominantly of the Gram-negative type LPS-associated gastrointestinal dysmotility102 may explain one cause of gastrointestinal problems commonly observed after SCI.103212Topics in spinal cord injury rehabiliTaTionsummer 2017The second proposed factor linking the gut microbiome to metabolic syndrome involves short- chain fatty acids SCFA which are known to play an important role in regulating inflammation and insulin resistance.104 SCFAs including butyrate are also involved in gut-brain signaling through the vagus nerve105 which has been implicated in regulating metabolic and immune homeostasis.106 Additionally SCFA levels have been negatively correlated with colonic transit time.107Although an altered gut microbiome holds potential to impact health outcomes after SCI this novel source of inflammation has only received limited attention in persons with SCI.

They can also initiate and sustain chronic inflammation leading to the exacerbation of existing conditions and creating a microenvironment suitable for the development and sustained risk of new medical complications.Inflammatory Stress Effects on Health and Function After Spinal Cord Injury213Chronic inflammation amplifies the risk for cardiometabolic disorders after injury although treating inflammation as an independent cardiometabolic risk factor has been widely overlooked for this population.Also by exacerbating secondary complications chronic inflammation directly impacts both the quality of life and mortality risk after injury.

A recent study in persons with SCI reported that roughly 23 of participants had a symptomatic urinary tract infection45 although nearly 70 of participants had asymptomatic bacteriuria.45 Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in other populations54 and thus may explain one source of non-resolving inflammation after SCI.Pressure ulcers occur in 30 to 80 of persons with SCI.4755 If left untreated pressure ulcers can lead to severe infection and bacteremia.4 Pressure ulcers occur in parallel with secondary complications characterized by inflammation and may exacerbate conditions that lead to inflammation.

In the former for example a higher prevalence of pressure ulcers has been observed in persons with pneumonia.56 In the latter changing of a bandage and debridement of pressure ulcers can trigger autonomic dysreflexia.55 The concomitant occurrence of secondary conditions after SCI may impede the resolution of inflammation as chronic inflammation can delay wound healing.57 However chronic inflammation may also expedite the development of additional complications.

Chronic low-grade inflammation is an established risk factor for metabolic disorders in persons without SCI.9 Elevated values of C-reactive protein CRP a clinical marker of cardiovascular risk and systemic inflammation1011 have repeatedly been demonstrated in persons with SCI.812 These values correspond with high cardiovascular disease risk per defined guidelines of the American Heart Association1012 and are higher in persons with tetraplegia than paraplegia.12 Although survival rates after SCI have greatly improved13 persons aging with SCI face an increased risk for secondary health complications such as cardiovascular disease.14 Therefore it is critical that effective treatments for chronic inflammation be developed to lessen the long-term medical risks that have been documented.1516We review the factors that contribute to a chronic inflammatory state after SCI.

Manipulating this novel source of inflammation holds promise for persons with SCI as well as other conditions characterized by chronic inflammation.Pro-inflammatory phenotype after SCIAs noted recent attention has focused on blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a unified forerunner of cardiovascular disease111112 and apredictor of atherogenesis and cardiovascular events.112 This pro-inflammatory phenotype has now been documented after SCI by several laboratories.812113-118 An expanding body of in vitro studies supports the view that inflammation may directly influence disease processes.112 The pro- atherogenic activity of various serological products raises unique concerns for persons with SCI as concentrations of blood-borne inflammatory cytokines are typically elevated.

Thus far researchers and clinicians have focused on modulating acute inflammation to preserve sensorimotor function.
