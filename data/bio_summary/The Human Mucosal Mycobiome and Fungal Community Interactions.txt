In this review we will explore these associations along with the interactions between fungal communities and their human and microbial habitat and discuss the future applications of systems biology in determining their role in disease status.Keywords mycobiome microbiome bacterial-fungal interactions fungal-fungal interactions host-fungal interactions systems biologyIntroductionWith the global burden of fungal diseases rising researchers have begun to turn to next-generation sequencing NGS technology to investigate the role fungi play in the spectrum of human health and disease.

Therefore like the interactions between P. aeruginosa and C. albicans the outcome of the interaction between S. gordonii and C. albicans is likely to be controlled by the local environment.Fungal-Fungal InteractionsIn addition to interacting with bacteria fungi also interact with one another.

The roles these interactions play during infection are still unclear and it is possible that the host environment determines which interactions will prevail.The best-documented agonistic fungal-bacterial interactions occur in the oral cavity during the formation of dental plaque.

Therefore although our current knowledge of the role of the interactions between fungi and bacteria on the microbiota structure and composition are limited there is precedent that these interactions play an important role and require further investigation.Fungal-Bacterial InteractionsFungi and bacteria can interact on multiple levels making polymicrobial interaction studies complex.

Whilst a key component of these interactions are those between the fungi and the host innate and adaptive immune system the specifics of these interactions are covered elsewhere in this special issue.

From this we can see that an ability to model the interactions between host mycobiome and metabolome will be extremely powerful tool in determining the role of host-mycobiome interactions in both health and disease.Modeling of the Mycobiome Microbiome and Host InteractionsMetagenomic analysis can provide information for the genes and species of the bacteria and potentially fungi and through using different functional databases such as KEGG the metabolic functions of these communities can be determined.

Using GEMs in community metabolic modeling can successfully predict the contribution of individual species and interactions between them to the overall simplified community metabolism and elucidate the interactions between the bacteria .
