The complete genomic sequence of Vibrio gazogenes ATCC 43942 is reported herein contributing to the knowledge base of strains in the Vibrio genus.ibrio gazogenes is an estuarine Gram-negative bacterium that is known for its ability to synthesize industrially relevant proteins such as amylases and proteases  and bactericidal and fungicidal pigments magnesidin A  prodigiosins and cycloprodi-giosins .V.

Also in our ongoing unpublished data studies we have consistently observed the ability of this Vibrio strain to degrade mycotoxins and generate a unique set of antibiotics that are active against multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
