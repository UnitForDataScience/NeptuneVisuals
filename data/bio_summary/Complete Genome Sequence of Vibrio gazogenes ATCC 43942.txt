the complete genomic sequence of vibrio gazogenes atcc 43942 is reported herein contributing to the knowledge base of strains in the vibrio genus.ibrio gazogenes is an estuarine gram-negative bacterium that is known for its ability to synthesize industrially relevant proteins such as amylases and proteases  and bactericidal and fungicidal pigments magnesidin a  prodigiosins and cycloprodi-giosins .v.

also in our ongoing unpublished data studies we have consistently observed the ability of this vibrio strain to degrade mycotoxins and generate a unique set of antibiotics that are active against multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
