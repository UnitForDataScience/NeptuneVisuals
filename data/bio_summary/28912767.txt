The relative abundances of Knufia Microcyclospora Microcyclosporella Parastagonospora Penidiella Phoma and Uwebaunia in the rumen of S kids were low 2 at all ages while their relative abundances in the rumen of G kids increased with age P  0.05.

Results showed that higher P  0.05 relative abundances of Prevotella Butyrivibrio Pseudobutyrivibrio Methanobrevibacter.gottschalkii Neocallimastix Anoplodinium- Diplodinium and Polyplastron and lower relative abundance of Methanosphaera P  0.042 were detected in the rumen of S kids when compared to those in G kids.

The relative abundance of Neocallimastix was greater P  0.001 while relative abundances of Microcyclosporella Knufia Parastagonospora and Uwebraunia were lower P  0.05 in the rumen of S kids compared to those in G kids.

The relative abundances of Anoplodinium-Diplodinium and Polyplastron were greater P  0.05 while Polyplastron relative abundance was lower P  0.001 in the rumen of S kids compared to those in G kids.

Finally Microcyclosporella and Parastagonospora are well-known fungal plant-pathogens     and their greater relative abundances in the rumen of G kids suggest the notion that fungal composition is diet-driven     which provokes further consideration of their roles in modulating host immune function.To our knowledge limited studies research on microbiota and host innate immune function cross-talk in the rumen and how such interaction can be impacted by dietary interventions.

The findings provide useful information in interpreting microbiota and host interactions and developing nutritional strategies to improve the productivity and health of rumen during early life.Keywords rumen microbiota mucosal innate immune function animal development process feeding typeINTRODUCTIONRuminants have a remarkable ability to convert human- indigestible plant biomass into human-digestible food products through rumen microbial fermentation  .

Conversely Prevotella relative abundance increased drastically P  0.01 with age being the most dominant genus after day 28 20 while Bacteroides relative abundance was high 12.1 at only day 7.

After day 28 relative abundances of ruminal Asteroleplasma and Anaeroplasma ranged from 0.3 to 1.2in G kids while their ruminal relative abundances were low 0.2 in S kids.

Furthermore expression of TJs declined P  0.05 from day 0 to 70 in the ruminal mucosa of both groups.Relationship between Microbial Community and Expression of Genes Involved in Ruminal Mucosal Innate Immune FunctionAs presented in  TLR1 mRNA abundance was positively correlated with R  0.50 relative abundances of Anaeroplasma Knufia Piromyces Uwebraunia and Entodinium while negatively correlated with R  0.50 relative abundances of Mbb.

gottschalkii relative abundance while TLR3 mRNA abundance was positively correlated with R  0.50 relative abundances of Knufia and Uwebraunia.
