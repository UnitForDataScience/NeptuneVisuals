The selected functions were O2-independent peripheral pathways car- boxylation addition of fumarate and hydroxylation O2-dependent pe- ripheral pathways dioxygenase and monooxygenase O2-dependent central pathways oxygen intradiol ring-cleavage and oxygen-depen- dent extradiol ring-cleavage and O2-independent central pathways ATP dependent ring cleavage .Overall families belonging to Archaea and Bacteria domains were in- volved with some steps of aromatic compound degradation based on the functional gene assignment .

These data suggest a predominance of aerobic pe- ripheral pathways in the FBR and anaerobic peripheral pathways in the UASB and EGSB reactors.The main goal of peripheral pathways is to transform aromatic com- pounds into central intermediate compounds such as benzoyl- coenzyme A .

BarceloKeywordsLinear alkylbenzene sulfonate LAS Aromatic compound degradation pathways Illumina sequencing genetic potentiala b s t r a c t The taxonomic and functional diversity of three different biological reactors fluidized bed reactor FBR up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor UASB and expanded granular sludge bed reactor EGSB used for commercial laundry wastewater treatment was investigated using metagenome shotgun sequencing.

Within the O2-dependent pathways the most prevalent genes in all samples were 4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase EC 4.1.1.44 and 3-oxoadipate enol-lactonase EC 3.1.1.24 for intradiol ring cleav- age and homogentisate 12-dioxygenase EC 1.13.11.5 for extradiol ring-cleavage.In summary the UASB and EGSB reactors showed a prevalence of central and peripheral O2-independent pathways whereas the FBR re- actor presented a prevalence of central and peripheral O2-dependent pathways.

The exclusive and shared genera by UASB and EGSB samples showed a predominance of facultative anaerobic or strict anaerobic growth.The investigation of the virome in the biological reactor samples showed overrepresentation of the Microviridae family with relative abundance ranging from 51.3 to 68.1 and with Bacteria as a host followed by Myoviridae and Siphoviridae families with percentages higher than 6 and with Bacteria and Archaea as hosts .

Normally O2-independent peripheral pathways include carboxylation the addition of fumarate and hydroxylation whereas O2-dependent peripheral pathways include the action of dioxygenases and monooxygenases.

For the pathways for aromatic compound degradation data showed the presence of O2- independent peripheral pathways that include carboxylation the addi- tion of fumarate and hydroxylation with a relative abundance of 0.94 for the FBR reactor and 1.30-1.53 for EGSB and UASB respectively .

Therefore UASB showed a higher relative abundance of O2-independent central pathways whereas FBR showed a higher per- centage of O2-dependent central pathways.

Interestingly archaeal members may be related to O2-independent peripheral and O2-dependent central pathways suggesting that such microorganisms should not be neglected in future studies of the biodegradation of LAS.Additionally some bacterial families such as Bradyrhizobiaceae Sphingomonadaceae Nocardiaceae Rhodocyclaceae and Geobacteraceae likely play an important role in the degradation pathways of aromatic compounds which is consistent with previous findings using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.ConclusionsThis study represents a major step forward compared to previous studies in which the functional roles were inferred using the rRNA gene.

The EGSB and UASB reactors showed a predominance of methanogens and genes related to methanogenesis with a prevalence of the acetoclastic pathway in addition to the peripheral and central O2-independent pathways for aromatic compound degrada- tion.
