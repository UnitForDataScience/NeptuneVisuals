three other meta-analyses have since been published but are limited by heavy reliance on observational data and heterogeneous inclusion criteria.7-9 two randomized controlled trials rcts for fmt in uc have been published since the most recent meta-analysis.1011 furthermore no meta-analysis to date has focused on randomized trials or examined endoscopic healing from fmt an outcome which is felt to be a key endpoint of clinical trials in uc given the long-term outcomes associated with it.12to update and improve on the previous systematic reviews we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fmt in uc using only high-quality evidence.methodsstudy selectiona systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies that investigated treatment with fecal microbiota1702  inflamm bowel dis  volume 23 number 10 october 2017table 1. definition of outcomes from trials includedsubscore 1paramsothy 2017 mild-to-moderate uc mayoscore 4-10 with endoscopic subscore 1score 14 0mayo score 3 and 1 reduction in endoscopic mayo scoremayo score33 point reduction in mayo score or 50 or greater reduction from baseline in combined rectal bleeding plus stool frequency subscores or bothscore 14 0 mayoendoscopicscore 14 0rossen2015 mild-to-moderate uc sccai4-11 with endoscopic subscore 1sccai simple clinical colitis activity index.sccai 2 and 1 reduction in endoscopic mayo subscoresccai 21.5 point reduction insccaimayoendoscopic score 14 0transplantation in uc.
