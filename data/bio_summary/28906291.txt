All 4 studies were prospective RCTs.10112021 One study administered FMT through the upper gastrointestinal tract through nasoduodenal infusion21 and the other studies used the lower gas- trointestinal tract for administration.112021 Two studies used low frequency of administration 2-3 doses total1121 and 2 studies used higher frequency of administration 6-41 doses total.1020 Two studies used single donor for FMT2021 and 2 studies used pooled donors for FMT preparation.1011 One study ensured all FMT sam- ples were anaerobically prepared.11 Duration of the studies was between 7 and 12 weeks.

A further 6 studies were excluded after careful review of the full text 5 were cohort studies14-18 and 1 was a pediatric RCT.19 Overall4 studies including 1 abstract with 277 participants were eligible for meta-analysis.10112021Characteristics of Included StudiesCharacteristics of studies included are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Ongoing prospective studies including a recently funded American Gastroenterological Asso- ciation AGA national FMT registry that aims to prospectively monitor 4000 patients for up to 10 years post-FMT will help determine the short-term and long-term safety profile of FMT Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02403622.23Rigorous donor screening protocols were used for these studies and would need to be used if FMT were to become acceptable for clinical practice.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess fecal microbiota transplantation FMT as a treatment for active UC.Methods A literature search was conducted to identify high-quality studies of FMT as a treatment for patients with UC.

Odds ratios with 95 confidence intervals CIs are reported.Results Overall 4 studies with 277 participants were eligible for inclusion.

Three other meta-analyses have since been published but are limited by heavy reliance on observational data and heterogeneous inclusion criteria.7-9 Two randomized controlled trials RCTs for FMT in UC have been published since the most recent meta-analysis.1011 Furthermore no meta-analysis to date has focused on randomized trials or examined endoscopic healing from FMT an outcome which is felt to be a key endpoint of clinical trials in UC given the long-term outcomes associated with it.12To update and improve on the previous systematic reviews we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMT in UC using only high-quality evidence.METHODSStudy SelectionA systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies that investigated treatment with fecal microbiota1702  Inflamm Bowel Dis  Volume 23 Number 10 October 2017TABLE 1.

High sen- sitivity filter was used to limit studies to RCTs.

The reference lists of any studies meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed manually to identify additional relevant publications.

We adhered to PRIS- MA preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta- analyses recommendations where possible.13InclusionExclusion CriteriaFor inclusion in the meta-analysis studies were required to meet the following criteria 1 prospective randomized controlled design 2 enrolled adult subjects with endoscopically and clinically active UC based on clinical assessment scores commonly used for UC 3 fecal transplantation offered in the interventional arm and4 control group receives a placebo consisting of only the FMT excipient no microbiota or an autologous FMT.

colonoscopy enteric tube or enemas were all permitted as were studies that used either single or pooled donor FMT.
