Peak intensities for pentanoic acid valine leucine isoleucine 3-phenyllactic acid phenylalanine 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 2-phenyllactic acid putrescine indole-3-propanoic acid ferulic acid indole-3-lactic acid L-tyro- sine indole-3-propanoic acid ferulic acid indole-3-lactic acid L- tryptophan and deoxycholic acid in fecal samples were gradually increased along with increased sample weight in the TICs.

Method 2 MC 21 locates in the left side of the inner circle and emphasized the majority fatty acid meta- bolismlipids metabolism 3 TCA Cycle intermediates isocitric acid a-ketoglutaric acid and succinic acid polyamines purine and pyrimidine derivatives and 2 metabolites from tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolism phenylacetic acid and mandelic acid.

The debris was consid- ered as pre-extracted pooled feces samples and used for method evaluation.Standard mixtures were prepared by mixing the stock solutions in water or methanol resulting in a final concentration of 500 mM for each amino acid 250 mM for each phenyl derivative organic acid and fatty acids and 125 mM for each choline metabolite bile acid indole sugar vitamin and amine.

The correlation coefficients r2 for 3-phenyllactic acid 4- hydroxyphenylacetic acid and deoxycholic acid in fecal samplesranged from 10 mg to 40 mg approached 0.99.

The optimal condition influencing the identified metabolite extraction is experiment 3 31 methanolchloroform vv which is correlated to most of the resolved peaks.acids SCFA including pentanoic acid hexanoic acid and 3- methylvaleric acid.

This area had 23 tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolites 4 metabolites from tryptophan meta- bolism tryptophol indole-3-acetic acid indole-3-propanoic acid and xanthurenic acid and 6 metabolites from fatty acid meta- bolismlipids metabolism.

The value of P1 is obtained from the low-dosed group and the control group The value of P2 is obtained from the mid-dosed group and the control group The value of P3 is obtained from the high-dosed group and the control group.c Fold change Fc is the ratio of the mean value for measured fecal samples obtained from each rhubarb-dosed group to the mean value for the control samples obtainedfrom the control group.

The value of Fc 1 is obtained from the low-dosed group and the control group The value of Fc 2 is obtained from the mid-dosed group and the control group The value of Fc 3 is obtained from the high-dosed group and the control group.decreased in rhubarb treated samples.
