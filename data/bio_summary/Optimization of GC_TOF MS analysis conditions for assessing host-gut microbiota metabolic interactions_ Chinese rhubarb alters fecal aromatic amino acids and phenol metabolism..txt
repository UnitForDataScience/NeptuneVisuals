the debris was consid- ered as pre-extracted pooled feces samples and used for method evaluation.standard mixtures were prepared by mixing the stock solutions in water or methanol resulting in a final concentration of 500 mm for each amino acid 250 mm for each phenyl derivative organic acid and fatty acids and 125 mm for each choline metabolite bile acid indole sugar vitamin and amine.

most of these metabolites in fecal samples ranged from 20 mg to 50 mg exhibited good linearity see supplementary material table 2. the correlation coefficients r2 for 3-phenyllactic acid 4- hydroxyphenylacetic acid and deoxycholic acid in fecal samplesranged from 10 mg to 40 mg approached 0.99. the linearity of putrescine was only in the range from 20 mg to 40 mg. therefore 40-mg fecal sample was selected as the optimum weight for determining these metabolites.another experiment design was set to investigate the extraction efficiency with different extraction solution for metabolites in different pathways.

the optimal condition influencing the identified metabolite extraction is experiment 3 31 methanolchloroform vv which is correlated to most of the resolved peaks.acids scfa including pentanoic acid hexanoic acid and 3- methylvaleric acid.

iaa indole-3- propanoic acid ipa and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid 5-hiaa were elevated and xanthurenic acid was decreased in rhubarb treated samples in a dose dependent manner.

the mass spectrometry data was acquired at full scan mode mz 30- 600 with an acquisition rate of 10 spectra per second and a solvent delay of 7 min.method validation62 reference standards representing choline metabolism fatty acid metabolism tryptophan metabolism tyrosine and phenylala- nine metabolism lysine metabolism histidine metabolism argi- nine and proline metabolism branched-chain amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism tca cycle were used to evaluate with optimized procedure.

method 1 located in the left side of the bi-plot and mc 11 emphasized two tca metabolites malic acid and fumaric acid and short chain fattyfig.

2 intermediates from tca cycle malic acid and citric acid and some purine and pyrimidine derivatives and metabolites in arginine and proline metabolism are highly correlated with method n1 and n2.

the correlation between phenyl-containing metabolites and gut microbiota has been widely reported e. decreased phenylalanine and increased levels of most of the phenyl-containing metabolites such as 4- hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid indicates the elevated conversion of phenylalanine in the gut.

the decreased level of putrescine and increased level of ornithine in the rhubarb treatment feces samples indicates inhibited activity of odc associated with rhubarb treatment.fumaric acid and succinic acid are the end products of anaerobic bacteria fermentation in the gut .
