Subsequently their synteny with respective partner genes cutC and cntA was determined where genes separated by10 genes based on locus tag were considered as syntenous.Due to the high consistency of all parameters investigated for cutC HMM similarity cutoffs were chosen as the sole selec- tion criterion resulting in 1114 candidate genes 454 unique proteins.

No significant correlations between gene abun- dances of cutC with relative abundances of respective taxa previously described to contain those genes were observed Additional file Specifically Clostridium XIVa and Desulfovibrio relative abundances based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis were dissimilar to cutC gene abundances obtained with our assay.

In silico analysis on coverage of developed primers suggested that a broad range of cutC and cntA gene sequences are targeted namely 93 and 96 of all unique cutC and cntA genes respectively allowing for one mismatch in each primer.To test actual primer performance on various targets in vitro short synthetic sequences that contained the target sequences from distinct taxa covering a broad thermo- dynamic range were used as a template in qPCR reac- tions.

Currently little information on the composition of TMA producers in the gut is available due to their low abundance and the requirement of specific functional-based detection methods as many taxa show disparate abilities to produce that compound.Results In order to examine the TMA-forming potential of microbial communities we established databases for the key genes of the main TMA-synthesis pathways encoding choline TMA-lyase cutC and carnitine oxygenase cntA using a multi-level screening approach on 67134 genomes revealing 1107 and 6738 candidates to exhibit cutC and cntA respectively.

In this study we hence considered YeaW as belonging to the CntA cluster of enzymes as originally proposed by Zhu and colleagues Importantly a recent report based on a genome-screening approach suggesting that numerous taxa contain both cntAB and yeaWX is misleading  as the database developed in this study unequivocally shows that the vast amount of genomes exhibits a single copy of this gene group.The established databases present a comprehensive update of previous cutC and cntA gene sequence collections adding a multitude of new gene sequences.

The reference sets for each gene contained all unique sequences considered as cutC and cntA genes respectively as well as the 300 top-scoring unique protein sequences below the set HMM thresholds representing distinct sequences see the  and  sections the 34 sequences derived from Bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true cntA were included as well as previously performed for butyrate producers  This allowed a clear differentiation of amplicons that showed low similarity to reference se- quences into those probably encoding enzymes for TMA production and others that are considered not to encode this function which were not included in follow-up analyses.

However the majority of those se- quences were identical to other cntA genes in the respective genomes and only two candidates Klebsiella pneumoniae BIDMC 18C and Cupriavidus taiwanensis STM 6070 exhibited two non-identical cntA sequences.Gene-targeted assays to investigate the TMA-producing communityGene-targeted assays for cutC and cntA were developed in order to determine the potential of the gut microbiota to produce TMA and to characterize the composition of this functional community in detail.

An initial 95 degC step for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 degC for 45 s annealing at 57 and 53 degC for cutC and cntA respectively for 45 s and an extension step at 72 degC for 45 s deploying final primer concentrations of 2.5 and 0.75 mM for cutC and cntA respectively.

XLSX 442 kbAdditional file 3 Results of standard curves for cutC A and cntA B are shown whereas amplification results of various short synthetic sequences containing the cutC C or cntA D primer target sequences aredisplayed below.
