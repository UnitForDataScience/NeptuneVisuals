in this study we hence considered yeaw as belonging to the cnta cluster of enzymes as originally proposed by zhu and colleagues importantly a recent report based on a genome-screening approach suggesting that numerous taxa contain both cntab and yeawx is misleading  as the database developed in this study unequivocally shows that the vast amount of genomes exhibits a single copy of this gene group.the established databases present a comprehensive update of previous cutc and cnta gene sequence collections adding a multitude of new gene sequences.

in silico analysis on coverage of developed primers suggested that a broad range of cutc and cnta gene sequences are targeted namely 93 and 96 of all unique cutc and cnta genes respectively allowing for one mismatch in each primer.to test actual primer performance on various targets in vitro short synthetic sequences that contained the target sequences from distinct taxa covering a broad thermo- dynamic range were used as a template in qpcr reac- tions.

melting curves were subsequently performed using the following program 95 degc for 5 s followed by 65 degc for 60 s and a final continuous reading step of seven acquisitions per second between 65 and 97 degc.table 1 primers targeting cutc and cnta as well as the v1-2 region of the 16s rrna gene with modified forward primer are shownbold letters highlight the degenerate bases within sequences total combinations--cutcf 32 cutcr 16 cntaf 32 cntar 512 16sf 32 16sr 1. expected sizes of amplified products excluding primers are 275 bp cutc and 249 bp cnta based on references acl49259 and efk52065 respectivelystandard curves were generated from dilutions of 106 to 103 genome copies where an equimolar mixture of dna from clostridium hathewayi dsm 13479 and desulfovi- brio desulfuricans subsp.

no significant correlations between gene abun- dances of cutc with relative abundances of respective taxa previously described to contain those genes were observed additional file specifically clostridium xiva and desulfovibrio relative abundances based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis were dissimilar to cutc gene abundances obtained with our assay.

currently little information on the composition of tma producers in the gut is available due to their low abundance and the requirement of specific functional-based detection methods as many taxa show disparate abilities to produce that compound.results in order to examine the tma-forming potential of microbial communities we established databases for the key genes of the main tma-synthesis pathways encoding choline tma-lyase cutc and carnitine oxygenase cnta using a multi-level screening approach on 67134 genomes revealing 1107 and 6738 candidates to exhibit cutc and cnta respectively.

an initial 95 degc step for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 degc for 45 s annealing at 57 and 53 degc for cutc and cnta respectively for 45 s and an extension step at 72 degc for 45 s deploying final primer concentrations of 2.5 and 0.75 mm for cutc and cnta respectively.

xlsx 442 kbadditional file 3 results of standard curves for cutc a and cnta b are shown whereas amplification results of various short synthetic sequences containing the cutc c or cnta d primer target sequences aredisplayed below.

however the majority of those se- quences were identical to other cnta genes in the respective genomes and only two candidates klebsiella pneumoniae bidmc 18c and cupriavidus taiwanensis stm 6070 exhibited two non-identical cnta sequences.gene-targeted assays to investigate the tma-producing communitygene-targeted assays for cutc and cnta were developed in order to determine the potential of the gut microbiota to produce tma and to characterize the composition of this functional community in detail.

the reference sets for each gene contained all unique sequences considered as cutc and cnta genes respectively as well as the 300 top-scoring unique protein sequences below the set hmm thresholds representing distinct sequences see the  and  sections the 34 sequences derived from bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true cnta were included as well as previously performed for butyrate producers  this allowed a clear differentiation of amplicons that showed low similarity to reference se- quences into those probably encoding enzymes for tma production and others that are considered not to encode this function which were not included in follow-up analyses.

panel a depicts gene abundances of cutc red and cnta blue relative to the total amount of 16s rrna gene copies of a sample.

as for the amplicon analysis above the refer- ence set of each gene additionally included sequences that were below the set hmm threshold 500 top-scoring unique nucleotide sequences for cutd and cntb the threshold was defined by the lowest scoring gene that was syntenous with its partner gene sequences derived from bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true cnta were included as well.

thus due to the low abun- dance of bacteria encoding a tma-producing potential sequencing depth was not enough to ensure adequate coverage for assembly the blast searches yielded on average only 56 and 13 reads for cutc and cutd respect- ively even for hmp datasets where an ample amount of reads on average 108 is provided.in order to gain insights into tma-producing communities of atherosclerotic individuals we reanalyzed metagenomes provided by karlsson and colleagues  who specif- ically investigated the microbial composition of symp- tomatic atherosclerosis patients n  12 and compared them to healthy control samples n  13. our results indicated increased abundances of bacteria exhibiting the potential to produce tma by about a factor of2 in the patient group where the abundances of key genes of both pathways were elevated median values of 0.39 and 0.11 patient group versus 0.22 and 0 controls for cutc and cnta respectively as a per- centage of bacteria calculated to exhibit the genes additional file .

subsequently their synteny with respective partner genes cutc and cnta was determined where genes separated by10 genes based on locus tag were considered as syntenous.due to the high consistency of all parameters investigated for cutc hmm similarity cutoffs were chosen as the sole selec- tion criterion resulting in 1114 candidate genes 454 unique proteins.

on average 98.2 cutc and 92.5 cnta of all merged sequences passed these initial steps resulting in a mean of 40915 - 12376 cutc sequences per sample from 23696 to 71952 and 42079 - 7746 cntasequences from 28471 to 52687 derived from 50 and 12 samples respectively.

consequently overall nucleotide similarity of cutc amplicons to reference sequences was low 86 - 7.detailed analysis applying high clustering identity cutoffs 99 and 98 nucleotide similarity revealed high diver- sities of the cutc gene with several thousand distinct sequence types that are shared between a few samples 10 additional file at a cutoff level of 95 1310 distinct sequence types could be differentiated.
