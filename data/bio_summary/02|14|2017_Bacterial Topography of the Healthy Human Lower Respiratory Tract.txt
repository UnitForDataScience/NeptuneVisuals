we sought to establish whether bronchoscopic sampling accurately reflects the lung microbiome in health and to distinguish between two proposed routes of authentic microbial immigrationi dispersion along contiguous respiratory mucosa and ii subclinical microaspira- tion.

in health the lung microbial community compo- sition determined by culture-independent techniques correlates with key features of host inflammation   and its variation at spatially distinct lung sites within individuals is lower than intersubject community variation .culture-independent analyses of bronchoscopic specimens identify the oropharynx as the primary source for the bacterial lung microbiome in health   .

thus provided one accepts the validity of bronchoscopic sampling these findings indicate that the healthy lung microbiome is determined largely by the balance between immigration of the oropharyngeal microbiota and its elimination by mucociliary clearance coughing and local host defenses the adapted island model of lung biogeography  .however with few exceptions     studies of healthy individuals have been performed by using a single bronchoscopic specimen per subject and few have systematically analyzed the bacterial topography of the healthy human respiratory tract.

we analyzed samples independently of smoking status which does not induce significant differences in the lung microbiome of otherwise healthy individuals .

these findings and especially these methodological considerations provide crucial reference information to define how bacteria contribute to infectious and noninfectious lung diseases which collectively cause 15 of worldwide deaths.verifying that bronchoscopic sampling can be used reliably to study the human lung microbiome has several important implications.

investigative bronchoscopy is increasingly being incorporated into multicenter observational trials to link microbiome analyses to intermediate biomarkers of disease activity and progression .

fortunately with this precaution the source of bacterial dna becomes clear.consistent with numerous previous studies of the healthy human bacterial lung microbiome      we found that airway and lung communities resemble oropharyngeal communities with minimal evidence of site-specific enrichment by reproducing bacteria.

the bacterial signal introduced by these sources--referred to variously as the kitome and contaminome--is unavoidable in low-biomass microbiome studies  .

we have adopted and strongly support recommendations on minimizing the risk of systematic bias and false grouping in low-biomass microbiome studies  i.e.

sequencing of multiple negative controls for all potential sources of contamination using a single dna extraction kit for all specimens randomizing the order in which specimens are processed and systemati- cally comparing the taxa detected in negative controls with those in biological speci- mens to determine the relative influence of reagent contamination.our results provide further support for the adapted island model    in which the lung microbiome in health is determined by the balance of microbial immigration here identified as chiefly due to microaspiration and elimination    with a minimal detectable influence from selective pressure on reproducing communities .

further studies are needed to elucidate how specific pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases  alter this balance of ecological forces and conversely how deviations in the structure of bacterial respiratory tract communities from the neutral orally derived microbiome participate in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung diseases.
