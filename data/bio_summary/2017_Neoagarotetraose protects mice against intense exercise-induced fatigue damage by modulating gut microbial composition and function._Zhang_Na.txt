The Motion and NAT mice were given identical intense exercise simultaneously while the Control mice were raised without any exercise pro- tocols.

A recent finding showed that exercise initiated dur- ing early life might have a more pronounced impact on the gut microbiota than exercise initiated in adulthood 27.Our results proposed that intense exercise could signifi- cantly change gut microbiota structure increasing pathogens and decreasing probiotics.

The detailed exercise protocol is described in the following sec- tion.

The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Ocean University of China Approved protocol ID SCKK2012-0001.Exercise protocolA forced exercise wheel-track treadmill YLS-10B Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences Jinan China was used in this study.

The relative abundance of Desulfovibrionales was significantly increased by intense exercise.

The results suggest that intense exercise damaged the integrity of the histological mor- phology of the intestinal mucosa as well as immune function while NAT prevented injury to the intestinal mucosa.
