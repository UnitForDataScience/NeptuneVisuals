Taken together our data suggest that NAT tended to alter the microbial composition of mice under intense exercise.NAT affected the gut microbial diversity of mice under intense exerciseMicrobial diversity in the mice gut was assessed using a QI- IME pipeline based on the OTU table Supporting Informa- tion Table 2 generated using a Closed Reference protocol 16.

Compared to the Motion mice the NAT-fed mice exhibited an increase in body weight.3.2 NAT maintained gut epithelial integrity in mice under intense exerciseWe analyzed the histological morphology of the small intes- tine of the mice Fig.

After a 7-day acclimation period the mice were randomly assigned to three groups of eight mice each untreated group Control intense exercise group Motion and intense exercise plus NAT treatment group NAT.

Together these findings suggest that NAT may improve intestinal barrier integrity in mice undergoing intense exercise.3.3 Dietary NAT altered the microbiota metabolic products of mice under intense exerciseWe determined the fecal concentration of SCFAs including acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and pentanoate acid by GC Fig.

The Motion and NAT mice were given identical intense exercise simultaneously while the Control mice were raised without any exercise pro- tocols.

RESEARCH ARTICLENeoagarotetraose protects mice against intense exercise-induced fatigue damage by modulating gut microbial composition and functionNa Zhang1 Xiangzhao Mao1 Robert W. Li2 Enling Hou1 Yuming Wang1 Changhu Xue1 and Qingjuan Tang11 College of Food Science and Engineering Ocean University of China Qingdao China2 Animal Genomics and Improvement Laboratory United States Department of Agriculture Agriculture Research Service USDA-ARS Beltsville MD USAScope Exhaustive exercise stress has emerged as an important health issue and gastrointestinal problems are a common concern during intense exercise.

PCR was performed using the following cycling profile ini- tial denaturing at 95degC for 2 min followed by 20 cycles of 95degC for 30 s 60degC for 30 s and 72degC for 60 s. The amplicons were purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP bead kit Beck- man Coulter Genomics Danvers MA USA and quantified using a BioAnalyzer high-sensitivity DNA chip and a Quan- tiFluor fluorometer.

In this study we investigated the potential antifatigue effects of neoagarotetraose NAT in mice under intense exercise stress.

Furthermore NAT administration significantly increased the fecal concentration of total short-chain fatty acids p  0.01.Conclusion Together our findings suggest that NAT may protect mice against intense exercise- induced fatigue and provide insights into the mechanisms of NAT as a potential prebiotic.Keywords16S rRNA  Gut microbiota  Metagenome  NAT  SCFAsAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived July 30 2016Revised December 27 2016Accepted January 4 2017IntroductionFatigue has emerged as an important health issue in humans.

Consequently intense exercise stress led to signif- icantly reduced body weight in the mice p  0.05.
