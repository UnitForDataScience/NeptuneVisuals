Taken together the gut microbiota regulate the composition of bile acids and the activity of FXR signaling in the ileum of ApoE mice.Considering that bile acids undergo the enterohepatic circulation we determined whether the altered bile acid composition in GF ApoE mice was associated with mi- crobial regulation of hepatic enzymes in bile acid synthesis.

Col- lectively our findings suggest that GF ApoE mice have immune-regulatory properties including decreased plasma LPS levels and decreased pro-inflammatory molecules in macrophages and plasma which may lead to the reduction of aortic inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion forma- tion in GF ApoE mice.DISCUSSIONanalyses of MOMA-2-positive macrophages C and CD4 T cellsIn this study we demonstrated that GF ApoEmice areD in the aortic sinus from Conv n  6 and GF n  5 ApoEmice.

Collectively activation of the FGF15-FGFR4 axiswas associated with the suppression of bile acid synthesis viainhibition of CYP7A1 in GF ApoE mice.The gut microbiota affect cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liverNext we determined whether the altered bile acid pro- file in GF mice was associated with microbial regulation of enzymes in the cholesterol homeostasis.

UPLC-Q-TOFMS-based analysis of bile acids in the distal ileum and feces from GF and Conv ApoE mice revealed that the absence of gut microbiota affected the composition of bile acids both in the small intestine and the feces Fig.

The distal ileum from GF mice exclusively contained taurocholic acid TCA and tauro--muricholic acid TMCA whereas that from Conv mice included a variety of bile acids other than TCA and TMCA for example cholic acid and -muricholic acid MCA indicating that the gut microbiota would ef- fectively deconjugate taurine-conjugated bile acids in the small intestine.

We confirmed that most of the fecal bile acids in Conv mice were unconjugated bile acids whereas all bilen  7 and GF n  7 ApoE mice were prepared for plasma total cholesterol A left and triglycerides TG B left.

Next we investigated gene expressions involved in bile acid transporters in the distal ileum and found that the expressions of apical bile acid transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 Mrp2 and basolateral transporter organ solute transporter Osta were upregulated in the distal ileum of GF mice while theTABLE 1.

In the intes- tine bile acids restrict bacterial proliferation and over- growth whereas bacterial enzymes modify primary bile acid through deconjugation dehydrogenation dehydrox- ylation and sulfation reactions to produce secondary bile acids.

Taken together these results indicate that gut microbiota could regulate cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis in ApoE mice.The gut microbiota regulate bile acid homeostasis in ApoEKO miceTo assess how the gut microbiota regulate lipid metabo- lism we focused on the bile acids because they are synthe- sized from cholesterol in the liver then excreted into the intestine and converted into secondary bile acids by the gut microbiota.
