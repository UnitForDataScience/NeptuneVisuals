Bead transit was tracked by X-ray imaging to monitor gastric emptying 4 h small intestine SI transit 9 h and large intestine transit 12 h. Plasma extracts were analyzed by lipid and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography HILIC and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LC-MS. Cecal microbial com- position was determined by Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis using the QIIME pipeline.

While this suggests that GI transit may also be altered as occurs in intestinal stress-associated functional disorders fecal pellet output does not always correlate with colonic transit in response to stress 31.Understanding the relationship between stressanxiety and GI transit may help develop long-term approaches to self- management of mild dysmotility for example through dietary intervention.

GI transit was tracked at three time points by X-ray imaging while rats were under brief 5 isoflurane anesthesia to monitor exit from stomach 4 h small intestinal transit 9 h and large intestinal transit 12 h. The metallic beads were visualized by X-ray and the relatively opaque barium sulfate outlined the GI tract enabling identification of bead location.Ventral and right lateral views were taken using a portable X-ray unit Porta 100HF 2.0kW High Frequency Job Yokohama Japan including a camera and digital cassette Canon 55G DR sensor panel in conjunction with a laptop computer Lenovo ThinkPad W530 and image-viewing software Lenovo ThinkPad W530.

We used an established high- resolution imaging method to track GI transit of solid matter from the stomach to the distal colon in vivo 11.To achieve high-resolution images we used an X-ray imag- ing system which can readily determine relative rates of transit between regions.

We measured different regions by tracking the transit of six metallic beads over 12 h to assess difference in stomach emptying and in small and large intestinal transit.

This subset of animals was excluded from subsequent transit score analysis because no meaningful transit measure- ments were possible due to stomach emptying being substan- tially delayed.GI TransitSprague-Dawley.

First published April 13 2017 gastric accommodation and intestinal morphology suggest impaired gastrointestinal GI transit may occur in the Wistar-Kyoto WKY rat strain as common in stress-associated functional GI disorders.

Because changes in GI transit can alter microbiota composition we investigated whether these are altered in WKY rats compared with the resilient Sprague-Dawley SD rats under basal conditions and characterized plasma lipid and metabolite differences.

GI transit was decreased by 34 9 h and 21 12 h in WKY compared with SD rats.

The unexpected WKY rat phenotype of delayed gastric emptying yet rapid SI transit was associated with altered lipid and metabolite profiles.
