antifungal effect against c. albicans was only shown by biopure mtad.conclusionsoverall biopure mtad is the most effective root canal irrigant as it has shown an antibacterial effect against all the tested microorganisms.

the presence of doxycycline defines the superior antimicrobial effect of mtad against e. faecalis.9 however results of this research are in contradiction to reports which refute theantimicrobial effect of mtad against e. faecalis.10in the present study antifungal effect against c. albicans was shown only by mtad this result obtained was in agreement with the result given by arslan et al.27 who demonstrated antimicrobial action ofmtad against c. albicans and e. faecalis.

1 was used to prepare 6-mm diameter discs which were later soaked in 40 ul of normal saline and biopure mtad respectively.the company-made aztreonam and metronidazole antibiotic discs bd diagnostic india were also used for the test.these antibiotic discs were then aseptically transplanted to the agar plate formerly incubated with microorganisms.for group 1 and group 2 agar plates biopure mtad aztreonam metronidazole and normal saline containing discs and for group 3 and group 4 agar plates biopure mtad aztreonam and normal saline prepared discs were transferred aseptically.group 1 and group 2 agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment created using the anoxomat system mart microbiology bv netherlands for 48 h.group 3 and group 4 plates were incubated for 48 h at 37degc under the aerobic conditions in an atmosphere of 10 co2 in a co2 incubator new brunswick usa.

yujra et al.26 demonstrated that long-standing metronidazole therapy preferred the establishment of c. albicans in the oral cavity of rats.in the current study maximum mean zone of inhibition against e. faecalis was revealed by biopure mtad  which is in accordance with several other studies.7 newberry et al.8 in their studyidentified that seven out of the eight tested strains of e. faecalis growth were affected when mtad was used as a final irrigant.

metronidazole and aztreonam on the other hand are however not significantly efficacious against all strains of microbes commonly present in the root canal thus limiting their use as an effective antimicrobial root canal irrigant.although the present study was done with strict adherence to all the scientific protocols still further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the different irrigants which may further widen their horizon in the field of endodontics.financial support and sponsorshipnil.conflicts of interestthere are no conflicts of interest.referenceskargul b tanboga i altinok b. conventional endodontic treatment of primary molars usinggo tometronidazole as an intra-canal medicament a pilot study.

poor affinity has been shown for the pbp-3 of gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria which could be the reason behind its mild activity against e. faecalis.conclusionson the basis of results obtained in the current study it may be stated that biopure mtad can bego torecommended as an effective alternative to the currently used root canal irrigants due to its superior antimicrobial properties against both aerobic and anaerobic microbial organisms as well as c. albicans.
