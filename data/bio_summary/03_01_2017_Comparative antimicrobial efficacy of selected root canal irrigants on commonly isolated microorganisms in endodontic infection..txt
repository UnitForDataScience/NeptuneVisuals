Aztreonam also showed an antibacterial effect in the present study raising its possibility to be used as a root canal irrigant in the future.Key words Agar disc diffusion method BioPure MTAD Candida albicans Enterococcus faecalisINTRODUCTIONGo toReduction or elimination of microflora during root canal treatment is achieved by the combined effect of both chemomechanical preparation and intracanal medications.12 The removal of microorganisms andother irritants from the confines of the root canal is conducted by means of the mechanical action of instruments and the flow and backflow of the irrigating solutions.34BioPure MTAD DentsplyTulsa Tulsa OK USA which is a mixture of a tetracycline isomer citric acid and a detergent5 has been recommended as a final rinse irrigant because of its antimicrobial properties and its ability to remove the smear layer.67 It is less cytotoxic than most of the endodontic medicaments.

The presence of doxycycline defines the superior antimicrobial effect of MTAD against E. faecalis.9 However results of this research are in contradiction to reports which refute theantimicrobial effect of MTAD against E. faecalis.10In the present study antifungal effect against C. albicans was shown only by MTAD this result obtained was in agreement with the result given by Arslan et al.27 who demonstrated antimicrobial action ofMTAD against C. albicans and E. faecalis.

Antifungal effect against C. albicans was only shown by BioPure MTAD.ConclusionsOverall BioPure MTAD is the most effective root canal irrigant as it has shown an antibacterial effect against all the tested microorganisms.

Metronidazole and aztreonam on the other hand are however not significantly efficacious against all strains of microbes commonly present in the root canal thus limiting their use as an effective antimicrobial root canal irrigant.Although the present study was done with strict adherence to all the scientific protocols still further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the different irrigants which may further widen their horizon in the field of endodontics.Financial support and sponsorshipNil.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.REFERENCESKargul B Tanboga I Altinok B.

Yujra et al.26 demonstrated that long-standing metronidazole therapy preferred the establishment of C. albicans in the oral cavity of rats.In the current study maximum mean zone of inhibition against E. faecalis was revealed by BioPure MTAD  which is in accordance with several other studies.7 Newberry et al.8 in their studyidentified that seven out of the eight tested strains of E. faecalis growth were affected when MTAD was used as a final irrigant.
