On the other hand most of the lactobacilli preferring PR digests over the peptone grew better on PR16 or PR24 than on PR36.Consumption of PR peptides by bifidobacteria and lactobacilliPeptide utilization was analyzed by UPLCESI-MS for 8 Bifidobacterium and 7 Lactobacillus strains representative of different speciessubspecies and selected among those with best growth on PR digests .

Other bioactive peptides which could occur in PR were no longer detectable after digestion thus some doubts arise about their real availability in vivo.Potential health promoting effects of PR peptides are supported by observation that the digests of PR sustained abundant growth of pure cultures of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli natural beneficial colonizersof the human colon and potential probiotics  .

This study demonstrated that peptides derived from simulated gastrointestinal digestion of PR supported the growth of most lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.IntroductionParmigiano Reggiano PR is a raw-milk hard cooked long-ripened cheese of high quality and nutritional value produced in a restricted area in northern Italy.

Ripened PR is lactose- and galactose- free and rich in free organic acids mostly derived from bacterialAbbreviations PR Parmigiano Reggiano GIT gastrointestinal tract SLAB starter lactic acid bacteria NSLAB non-starter lactic acid bacteria PCA principal component analysis HPLC High Performance Liquid Chromatography UPLC Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography ESI electrospray ionization MS mass spectrometry Corresponding author at Dept.

On this basis it has been hypothesized that PR peptides could promote growth andor activity of these beneficial microbes thus modulating the resident microbiota towards a balanced and healthy composition .The health effects of PR bioactive peptides on intestinal bacteriarequire that they resist gastrointestinal digestion and at least partially reach the colon.

Overlaid Full Scan chromatograms obtained for the waters soluble extracts Panel A and the digests Panel B of PR16 black PR 24 green and PR 36 orange.

For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article.the PR can be sold on the market .Few previous studies performed in vitro digestion of PR but mainly focused on quantification of specific peptides   without providing a thorough characterization of the whole profile.

The cultures of human colonic microbiota confirmed that PR digest promoted the growth of commensal bifidobacteria.

The overall mineral content of PR is 4.0 to 4.5 with NaCl at approximately 1.5 .Long ripening times allow for cheese extensive proteolysis   due to the residual rennet activity and the enzymes of starter SLAB and non-starter NSLAB lactic acid bacteria.

The potential biological activity of PR peptides has recently attracted particular interest  .
