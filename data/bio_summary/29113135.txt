hl healthy humans nash nash patients std standard diet hfd high-fat diet.discussionsome studies indicate that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the regulation of host metabolism homeostasis innate immunity development of insulin resistance and progression of obesity -.

therefore we suggest that inoculated nash gut microbiota causing severe nafld might be related to inflammasome activation and further experiments are needed for verification.several reports point to strong correlations between the gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokines and the contribution to the progression of nafld .

these results revealed the relationship between western diet and gut microbiota might play important roles in nafld and nash.conclusionsthe results presented here provided evidence that composition of the intestinal microbiota may interfere with nafld andor nash progression through multiple inflammation reactions.

taken together our findings may lead to novel strategies such as colonization with fecal bacteria from nash patients to investigate nafld pathogenesis.supplementary materials the following are available online at  table s1 anthropometric and metabolic variables of donors table s2 real-time pcr primers used in this study.acknowledgments we thank the preclinical animal testing platform for precision medicine most 106-2319- b-492-001- human gut microbiota transplant which is funded by the ministry of science and technology most of taiwan for technical support in customized gut microbiota transplantation experiment.

although fibrosis is not a requirement for the diagnosis of nash it is often present in nash patients .

this experimental design resulted in four groups the hl feces inoculated in b6 mice fed the standard diet hl-std the hl feces inoculated into b6 mice fed the high-fat diet hl-hfd the nash patients' feces inoculated into b6 mice fed the standard diet nash-std and the nash patients' feces inoculated into b6 mice fed the high-fat diet nash-hfd.
