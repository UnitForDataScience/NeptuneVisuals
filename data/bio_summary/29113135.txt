Therefore we suggest that inoculated NASH gut microbiota causing severe NAFLD might be related to inflammasome activation and further experiments are needed for verification.Several reports point to strong correlations between the gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokines and the contribution to the progression of NAFLD .

Taken together our findings may lead to novel strategies such as colonization with fecal bacteria from NASH patients to investigate NAFLD pathogenesis.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at  Table S1 Anthropometric and metabolic variables of donors Table S2 Real-time PCR primers used in this study.Acknowledgments We thank the preclinical animal testing platform for precision medicine MOST 106-2319- B-492-001- human gut microbiota transplant which is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology MOST of Taiwan for technical support in customized gut microbiota transplantation experiment.

These results revealed the relationship between Western diet and gut microbiota might play important roles in NAFLD and NASH.ConclusionsThe results presented here provided evidence that composition of the intestinal microbiota may interfere with NAFLD andor NASH progression through multiple inflammation reactions.

These studies suggest that interventions targetingthe metabolism-associated activity of gut microbiota might be effective in treating obesity and the associated metabolic disorders such as NAFLD and NASH.Recent evidence from humans and from animal models has also linked gut microbiota to the pathological progression of NAFLDNASH via the gut-liver axis .

Therefore the imbalance of gut microbiota might correlate with insulin resistance and contributed to NAFLD severity.In recent years experimental and clinical studies have shown a pathogenic association between the gut microbiota and NAFLD.

Our results revealed that the gut microbiota from NASH Patients aggravated hepatic steatosis and inflammation.
