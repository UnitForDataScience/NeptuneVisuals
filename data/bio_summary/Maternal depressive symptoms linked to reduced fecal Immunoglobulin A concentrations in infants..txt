This was observed for infants exposed to antibiotics p  0.027 born to a mother with no depression history p  0.021 and born to a mother who had asthma or another allergic condition p  0.032. shows significantly lower infant sIgA concentra- tions in the Postnatal group compared to the reference group when the mother had asthma or allergy during pregnancy p  0.041.Lowest quartile sIgA by maternal depressive symptoms crude and adjusted associationsThe crude odds ratio OR for lowest fecal sIgA quartile was 2.12 95 CI 1.02-4.42  for the Both DS group indicating that infant exposure to maternal DS during the pre- and postnatal peri- ods elevated the likelihood of low fecal sIgA concentrations by 2- fold when compared to infants of mothers with few DS symptoms.

Hence in the event that elevated maternal glucocorticoids or catecholamines lower B cells in the human fetus and newborn infant this effect could lower or delay IgA production in the developing infant independent of serotonin activity.The chronicity of maternal prenatal depressive symptoms is lesswell studied but maternal distress often does not end at birth .

diarrhea and gastroenteritis and allergic symp- toms in the first three months of the infant's life   but whether maternal distress also affects human infant gut immunity has not been previously investigated.Our results show that maternal depressive symptoms are asso- ciated with lowered infant fecal sIgA a vital component in the first- line defense of the immature immune system and the development of gut microbiota in early life.

The percentage of infants having sIgA concentrations in the lowest quartile 3.23 mgg feces was 20 in the reference group which was lower than the percentages found in any of the DS groups 35-37 .Median infant fecal sIgA by maternal depressive symptoms stratified comparisonsFollowing stratification by breastfeeding status at stool collec- tion significantly lower sIgA concentrations were seen in not breastfed infants of mothers with both pre and postnatal DS com- pared to the reference group p  0.033 .

In this model the likelihood of having low fecal sIgA concentrations was 3.07 for infants in the Both group with multi- ple adjustment for infant age at stool sample collection breast- feeding status antibiotics exposure presence of household pets maternal gravida status maternal asthma or allergy during preg- nancy and prenatal SSRI use 95 CI 1.25-7.55 .There was a 2.44 95 CI 1.07-5.57 greater odds of having lowest quartile sIgA when mothers were in the Prenatal group in the same model.

For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article.DiscussionIn a subsample of 403 infants from a prospective birth cohort exposure to clinically significant levels of maternal depressive symptoms throughout the pre and postnatal period was associated with reduced infant fecal sIgA concentrations in the first few months of life.

Accumulating epidemio- logical evidence support links between pre and postnatal maternal distress and the development of asthma and allergy   which has been attributed to maternal behaviours such as smoking or reduced breastfeeding or other factors which affect the infant's immune system stress biology or risk for allergic diseases  .Indeed distress in the mother can reduce breastfeeding the main source of sIgA  promote smoking which lowers breast milk IgA levels  and increase exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs a pri- mary treatment for depression all of which have immunomodu- latory effects on the fetus or infant  .

How- ever pet exposure have shown to reduce the abundance of certain species of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria  .In the absence of prenatal depressive symptoms breastfeeding status greatly affected the association between postnatal maternal depressive symptoms and infant sIgA concentrations.

The odds ratio for postnatal depressive symptoms lost significance with the addition of the breastfeeding status variable suggesting that reduction of breastmilk intake may explain the very low concen- trations of infant sIgA seen with maternal postnatal depressive symptoms.

Exclusively breastfed infants green showed borderline significantly lower sIgA concentrations in infants of the Prenatal group compared to the reference group while infants not breastfed blue had significantly lower sIgA when in the Both group compared to the reference group.
