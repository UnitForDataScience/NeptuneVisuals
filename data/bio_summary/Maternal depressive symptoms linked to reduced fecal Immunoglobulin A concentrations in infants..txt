hence in the event that elevated maternal glucocorticoids or catecholamines lower b cells in the human fetus and newborn infant this effect could lower or delay iga production in the developing infant independent of serotonin activity.the chronicity of maternal prenatal depressive symptoms is lesswell studied but maternal distress often does not end at birth .

diarrhea and gastroenteritis and allergic symp- toms in the first three months of the infant's life   but whether maternal distress also affects human infant gut immunity has not been previously investigated.our results show that maternal depressive symptoms are asso- ciated with lowered infant fecal siga a vital component in the first- line defense of the immature immune system and the development of gut microbiota in early life.

accumulating epidemio- logical evidence support links between pre and postnatal maternal distress and the development of asthma and allergy   which has been attributed to maternal behaviours such as smoking or reduced breastfeeding or other factors which affect the infant's immune system stress biology or risk for allergic diseases  .indeed distress in the mother can reduce breastfeeding the main source of siga  promote smoking which lowers breast milk iga levels  and increase exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris a pri- mary treatment for depression all of which have immunomodu- latory effects on the fetus or infant  .

few studies have addressed the stress-microbiome-immunity connections in humans.using data from the canadian healthy infant longitudinal development child birth cohort the purpose of this study was to determine the association between maternal pre and postnatal depressive symptoms ds and infant fecal siga concentrations.

the odds ratio for postnatal depressive symptoms lost significance with the addition of the breastfeeding status variable suggesting that reduction of breastmilk intake may explain the very low concen- trations of infant siga seen with maternal postnatal depressive symptoms.
