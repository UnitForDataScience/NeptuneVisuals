A low FODMAP diet does not slow transit5 but it does reduce osmotic activity through the large bowel thus a FODMAP restriction may be efficacious in patients with fast transit to lessen their diarrhea.

Guidance from a dietitian will encompass dietary methods to treat IBS but additionally identify where dietary treatment is not indicated to ensure that diet is correctly used and pa- tients are not nutritionally or psychologically compromised.IntroductionA low FODMAP fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyols diet is predominantly used to re- duce symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome IBS and is now commonly used worldwide.

There is weak evidence for the use of probiotics to lessen IBS symptoms with the exception of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 showing small clinical benefit.18 Prebiotics may have merit in positively altering the microbiome and subsequent IBS symptoms but they are also FODMAPs which may exacer- bate symptoms.

Other treatments targeting reduced sensation or visceral stimulation are composed of antispasmodic agents including pep- permint oil simethicone mebeverine hydrochloride and butylscopolamine which have small benefit over placebo 58 vs 46.6 These may be considered as adjunct therapy to a low FODMAP diet or an alternative when FODMAP manipulation is less practical to apply e.g.

Par- ticularly in patients who are already reducing their FODMAP in- take fiber which commonly coexists with FODMAPs may also be reduced and oppose the benefit of the low FODMAP diet.

A low FODMAP fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyols diet effectively reduces symptoms in 75 of patients.

It is known that the degree of poly- merization is directly and inversely related to osmolarity8 there- fore a reduction in monosaccharides including polyols and disaccharides may be enough to reduce symptoms rather than a full low FODMAP diet.
