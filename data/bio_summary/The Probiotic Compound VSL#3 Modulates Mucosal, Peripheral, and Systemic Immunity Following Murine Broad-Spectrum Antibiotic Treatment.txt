Both complex SPF microbiota and VSL3 bacteria were able to stably colonize the murine intestinal tract of ABx mice further supporting the suitability of the microbiota depleted mouse model to explore the complexFIGURE 9  IFN-g and IL-10 producing CD4 cells in intestinal and systemic compartments of secondary abiotic mice following recolonization with VSL3 or complex murine microbiota.

In terms of activation status of immune cell populations we could observe that VSL3 recolonization was as efficient as complex microbiota recolonization given that VSL3 application resulted in a complete recovery of Treg activated DC and CD8 memoryeffector cells in all included intestinal and systemic immunological sites and of the CD4 memoryeffector cells in the small and large intestinal lamina propria.

Moreover mice subjected to FMT showed at day 28 after recolonization a complex large intestinal microbiota composition that was comparable to the microbiota in conventional control animals Figure 1C.Given that mice were clinicallymacroscopically uncompromised upon antibiotic treatment as well as following respective recolonization regimens as assessed by a clinical scoring system on a daily basis not shown we next assessed potential microscopic changes in the intestinal tract.

Both VSL3 treatment and FMT could sufficiently restore the antibiotics induced CD8 cell frequency reduction in the small and large intestines as indicated by higher small and large intestinal CD8 cell abundances as compared to ABx miceFIGURE 4  CD4 cells in intestinal and systemic compartments of secondary abiotic mice following recolonization with VSL3 or complex murine microbiota.

Hence again peroral VSL3 application or FMT were able to reverse antibiotics induced decreases in T cells depending on the respective immunological compartment.FIGURE 5  CD8 cells in intestinal and systemic compartments of secondary abiotic mice following recolonization with VSL3 or complex murine microbiota.
