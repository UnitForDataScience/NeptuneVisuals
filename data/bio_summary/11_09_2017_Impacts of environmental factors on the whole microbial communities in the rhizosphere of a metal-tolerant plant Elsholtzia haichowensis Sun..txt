With essential roles in soil ammonification archaea arehighly related to NH3 availability affected by soil pH which de- termines the equilibrium between molecular NH3 and ionic NHth4 e. Additionally we revealed the obvious difference in archaeal taxonomic composition between metalliferous soils Tonglushan pH 6.96 Fengjiashan pH 7.40 and non-metalliferous soils Macheng pH 5.05 C. The dominant phylum Crenarchaeota was more abundant in the twometalliferous areas while Parvarchaeota behaved oppositely.

The present study therefore aimed to 1 unveil the whole microbial communities in the rhizospheric and sur- rounding soils of E. haichowensis including bacteria fungi and archaea 2 explore the influence of 37 EFs on the whole microbial communities in the rhizosphere of E. haichowensis 3 identify key influential factors shaping rhizospheric microbial community and distinguish the response of different microbial population to each EF.

The different impacts of pH on extractable- and DGT-fraction of HMs in the present study therefore suggested that DGT is a good analytical tool measuring the HM availability and mobility in situ determined by the syner- getic effects of soil pH texture and SOM.Microbial community structure and diversityThe copy numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA fungal 25-28S rRNA and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were quantified by qPCR to assess microbial populations in soils as listed in ESI Table S6.

Rhizosphere only showed strong impacts on fungi and bacteria accounting for 14.7 and 4.9 variation of fungal taxonomic composition and bacterial a-diversity.Soil property effects on microbial communityIn the present study bacteria and archaea were more sensitive to soil pH than fungi showing discriminated influence of soil pH across different microbial populations.

Strongly linked with microbial biomass soil aggregate size and water holding capacity  soil clay content has a close relationship with nutrient retention in soils and supplies better habitats for microbial community  .

The relationship between EFs and different soil microbial phylogenetic populations remains unclear in rhizosphere.Elsholtzia haichowensis Sun is a well-known indicator of copper Cu mines and candidate for phytoremediation widely distributed in Cu mining wastes and Cu-contaminated soils in China  .

The results from ecological network also proved that all the bacterial modules and 3 of the 4 archaeal modules were significantly correlated with spatial distance whereas it was only 3 of the 9 fungal modules ESI Table S8-S10.ConclusionThis study firstly explored the whole microbial communities including bacteria fungi and archaea in rhizospheric soils ofE.

The relative abundance of Parvarchaeota was significantly higher in soils from Macheng than those from the two metalliferous areas.The role of environmental factors in shaping microbial communityThe molecular ecological network was constructed to describe the complex patterns of bacterial fungal and archaeal inner- relationships .

The relationships between soil microbial commu- nities and EFs e. g. pH texture nutrients and spatial distance have been recently studied.

The bulk soils were sampled near Eh-surrounding soils at each site without vegetation.
