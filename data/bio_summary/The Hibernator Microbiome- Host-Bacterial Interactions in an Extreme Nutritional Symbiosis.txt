From mid-summer through early fall ground squirrels accumulate large adipose stores with body mass typically doubling from spring emergence to fall immergence into underground burrows.Ground squirrels are homeothermic during the active season body temperatures 35-37C andthen experience variable body temperatures during the hibernation season lasting 5-6 months in 13-lined ground squirrels and 8-9 months in Arctic ground squirrels.

Hibernation was facilitated by housing squirrels in cold rooms 4C ambient for 13-lined ground squirrels and -5C for Arctic ground squirrels and food and water were removed after the start of torpor bouts for the duration of hibernation.Results of both studies revealed that season has a strong effect on community assemblage of luminal microbiotas across the annual cycle.

However Proteobacteria isa relatively low-abundance phylum for both ground squirrels in all seasons 4.Seasonal changes in the structure of the mucosal microbiota have been examined in 13-lined ground squirrels 25.

Similarly in Arctic ground squirrels flow cytometry and live-dead assays of cecal luminal bacteria showed reduced cell densities and proportion of dead cells in hibernation relative to summer levels 110.Changes in taxonomic composition over the annual hibernation cycle in ground squirrels suggest a possible reprogramming of microbiome function.

In Arctic ground squirrels winter SCFA concentrations and proportions are not changed after 3 days of constant high body tem- perature posthibernation in the absence of feeding 110 confirming that the absence of dietary substrates and not low temperature itself is the main driver of metabolic output of the hibernator microbiota.The dominant effect of diet in regulating taxonomic composition of the hibernator microbiomeis particularly evident when contrasting results in ground squirrels with those in the Syrian hamster Mesocricetus auratus which feeds during interbout arousals to normothermia.

Together these two studies provide an insightful survey of seasonal changes in ground squirrels microbiotas and demonstrate the resilience of the communities in the face of extreme changes in substrate availability and temperature.Phylum-level changes in luminal microbiota composition over the hibernation cycle that arecommon to both ground squirrel species include increases in the relative abundance of Bac- teroidetes and Verrucomicrobia and reduced abundance of Firmicutes during hibernation 15110 Figure 2.

Such core assemblages in the ground squirrel gut may represent taxa that are particularly persistent during extreme dietary shifts of feeding and fasting.In general substantial similarity exists between microbiotas in 13-lined and Arctic ground squirrels at the family level and higher despite the fact that the two species inhabit very different environments short-grass prairie versus Arctic tundra respectively and maintain different min- imal body temperatures during torpor 3C versus -2.9C.

How- ever information from these studies is limited because the majority of gut bacteria are unculturable.Sequenced-Based Microbiota AnalysisThe first sequence-based targeted study of luminal microbiota in 13-lined ground squirrels used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR with DNA extracted from summer and hibernating squirrels with primers targeted to domain Bacteria a Bacteroides- Prevotella group Lactobacillus-Enterococcus group and Eubacteria-Clostridium group.

Arctic ground squirrels were all trapped in the wild and then sampled in summer after 3 months of hibernation in torpid or interbout arousal states or 3 days after hibernation ended when squirrels were at high body temperature but before feeding resumed.

In Arctic ground squirrels these parameters peak in summer squirrels followed by the winter states of torpor and IBA with posthibernation diversity the lowest 110.
