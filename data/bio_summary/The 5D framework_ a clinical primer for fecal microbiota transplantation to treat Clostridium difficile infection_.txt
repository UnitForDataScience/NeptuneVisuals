The 5D FMT framework includes decision donor discussion delivery and discharge .DECISION DECIDING ON THE APPROPRIATE PATIENT WITH C DIFFICILE INFECTION TO UNDERGO FMTIndications for FMTAccording to the initial FMT working group consisting of gastroenterology and infectious disease thought leaders the primary indications for FMT are as follows 1 recur- rent C difficile infection defined as 3 or more episodes of mild to moderate C difficile infection and failure to respond to a 6-week to 8-week taper of vancomycin or at least 2 episodes of C difficile infection requiring hospitali- zation and associated with significant morbidity 2 mod- erate C difficile infection with no response to standard therapy for at least 1 week and 3 severe C difficile infec- tion with no response to standard therapy for 48 hours.However many of the randomized controlled trials that came out after these initial recommendations enrolled patients who had failed an initial course of antibi- otics.In published treatment guidelines the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases have both included FMT as an option for recurrent C difficile infection.The recent European FMT guidelines report a strong recommendation with high quality of evidence for the use of FMT for the treatment of recurrent C difficile infection with overall resolution rates ranging between 85 and 89.7.

Among the patients treated with this sequential FMT protocol 91 5257 experienced clinical cure at 1 month with a 100 cure rate for severe C difficile infection n Z 19 and an 87 cure rate for severe-complicated C difficile infection n Z 33.This emerging body of literature on the use of FMT in critically ill patients suggests that FMT may be a viable alternative to colectomy however randomized controlled trials are needed.Stool testing for C difficile infectionIn order to confirm the diagnosis before performing an FMT clinicians should review all available results of C difficile infection tests including the type and timing.

Epidemiologic data suggest that the number of C difficile infection-associated hospitalizations nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010and a recent study estimated 29300 annual C difficile infection-associated deaths in the United States.FMT is now regarded as a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of recurrent C difficile infection.

The guidelines do not recommend the use of FMT for the first episode of C difficile infection given insufficient evidence.In terms of severe C difficile infection there is emergingevidence to suggest that FMT may be a useful tool in thetreatment of severe or severe-complicated C difficile infec- tion.

If patients do not respond to antibiotics against C difficile and have ongoing or intermittent diarrhea other etiologies should be investigated.We recommend that clinicians follow the 2016 Euro- pean Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines for C difficile infection testing which state that no single commercial test can be used as a stand-alone test for diagnosing C difficile infection.

Our recommendation is glutamate dehydrogenase EIA because it is less expensive and has a slightly superior negative predictive value at higher C difficile infection prevalence compared with NAATPCR 98 vs 96 at hypo- thetical C difficile infection prevalence of 50 and a nega- tive predictive value of 100 at lower C difficile infectionprevalence.

This primer navigates how to decide whether a patient with C difficile infection is appropriate for FMT and how to select and screen stool donors identify the ideal delivery modality and provide follow-up care after FMT.C difficile infection is a significant public health risk and has emerged as the most common cause of health care- associated infection in the United States.The rise of C difficile infection is a reflection in part of challenges with antibiotic stewardship and the emergence of moreAbbreviations CMV cytomegalovirus EBV Epstein-Barr virus EIA enzyme immunoassay FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration FMT fecal microbiota transplantation IBD inflammatory bowel disease IND investigational new drug NAAT nucleic acid amplification test PCR polymerase chain reaction.DISCLOSURE J. Allegretti and Z. Kassam are consultants for and receive research support from Finch Therapeutics.

Therefore we do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics against C difficile after FMT in patients who were given antibiotics not directed against C difficile.Patients should be followed closely to monitor for C difficile infection recurrence for up to 8 weeks after FMT.

The recommendation for refractory C difficile infection is also strong although the quality of evidence is low however it is noted that patients with refractory C difficile infection likely have more-severe disease.

Clinicians should review carefully whether a nucleic acid amplification test NAAT also called polymerase chain reaction PCR assay or a toxin AB enzyme immunoassay EIA that directly detects C difficile toxin was conducted for the C difficile toxin gene.
