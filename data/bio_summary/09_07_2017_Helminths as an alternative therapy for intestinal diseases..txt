TRUST-1 NCT01576471 a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating 250 North American patients with moderate-to-severe disease did not improve the disease activity index or remission rates although a nonsignificant improvement was noted in patients with a more severe disease score.TRUST-2 NCT01279577 a double-blind placebocontrolled randomized trial of 252 Eur opean adults with mildly-to-moderately active ileo- colonic uncomplicated CD documented that the administration of fortnightly doses of 250 2500 or 7500 TSO15 mL suspensionday over 12 wk with a four-week follow-up was safe with no serious adverse drug reactions.

Some questions remain to be investigated regarding the use of helminths in intestinal disease such as the importance of the particular species of helminths used appropriate dosing regimens low or high optimal timing of treatment before the onset of disease in acute or chronic disease or at younger ages the role of host genetics diet and environment and elucidation of the exact mechanisms of protective effect.In regard to the species of helminth we believethat the majority of the studies had negative results because of the use of T. suis.

Some pathologic processes increase intestinal permeability such as inflammatory bowel disease IBD311 atopic eczema12 celiac disease dermatitis herpetiformis13 cystic fibrosis1415 alcohol consumption16 use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs1720 and acute infectious diarrhea1221.

To date there are no studies of S. stercoralis for treating intestinal inflammation.Evidence of helminth therapy in inflammatory boweldiseaseApproximately 15 years ago the first clinical studies of helminth therapy for intestinal disease in humans utilized embryonated viable eggs of T. suis in the treatment of ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn's disease CD.
