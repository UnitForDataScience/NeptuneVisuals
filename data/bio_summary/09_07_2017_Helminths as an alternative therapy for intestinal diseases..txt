trust-1 nct01576471 a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating 250 north american patients with moderate-to-severe disease did not improve the disease activity index or remission rates although a nonsignificant improvement was noted in patients with a more severe disease score.trust-2 nct01279577 a double-blind placebocontrolled randomized trial of 252 eur opean adults with mildly-to-moderately active ileo- colonic uncomplicated cd documented that the administration of fortnightly doses of 250 2500 or 7500 tso15 ml suspensionday over 12 wk with a four-week follow-up was safe with no serious adverse drug reactions.

some questions remain to be investigated regarding the use of helminths in intestinal disease such as the importance of the particular species of helminths used appropriate dosing regimens low or high optimal timing of treatment before the onset of disease in acute or chronic disease or at younger ages the role of host genetics diet and environment and elucidation of the exact mechanisms of protective effect.in regard to the species of helminth we believethat the majority of the studies had negative results because of the use of t. suis.

some pathologic processes increase intestinal permeability such as inflammatory bowel disease ibd311 atopic eczema12 celiac disease dermatitis herpetiformis13 cystic fibrosis1415 alcohol consumption16 use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs1720 and acute infectious diarrhea1221.

to date there are no studies of s. stercoralis for treating intestinal inflammation.evidence of helminth therapy in inflammatory boweldiseaseapproximately 15 years ago the first clinical studies of helminth therapy for intestinal disease in humans utilized embryonated viable eggs of t. suis in the treatment of ulcerative colitis uc and crohn's disease cd.

with the arrival of the immunobiologic era and the use of antibodies we propose a distinctive pathway for treating patients with ibd and celiac disease.

we have some evidence about the safety and tolerability of helminth use but evidence about their impact on disease activity is lacking.

some questions remain to be investigated regarding the use of helminths in intestinal disease such as the importance of the specific species of helminths used appropriate dosing regimens optimal timing of treatment the role of host genetics diet environment and the elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action.

a decade later strachan proposed that reduced exposure to infections in early childhood owing to a combination of diminished family size improved living standards and higher levels of personal hygiene might result in an increased risk of allergic disease later in life30.

these studies showed safety tolerance and a significant disease remission when oral administration of viable and embryonated eggs was performed repeatedly4445.
