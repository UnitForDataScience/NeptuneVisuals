A lack of nutrient availability during fasting also stimulates the synthesis and release of 5-HT from EC cells in mice due to increased transcription of Tph1 Similarly exposure of primary colonic EC cells to low glucose reflecting in vitro fasting conditions also induces TPH1 expression and increases 5-HT synthesis and release EC cells are sensitive to both acute increases and chronic reductions in glucose availability although themechanisms governing such responses remain unclear.Glucose entry to EC cells through the Na-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 has been suggested as a potential pathway for glucose-stimulated 5-HT secretion in BONFigure 2.

In contrast activation of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors augments the respiratory capacity and mem- brane excitability of pancreatic islet cells to exert an incretinlike effect by increasing insulin secretion from b cells while suppressing glucagon release from a cells through activation of 5-HT1F receptors 61-64.

SCFAs can act in a chronic fashion on EC cells by increasing TPH1 expression and 5-HT synthesis The interaction ofSCFAs with free fatty acid receptor FFAR 2 may me- diate this response however clear evidence for this in primary EC cells has not yet been provided.EC cells respond to neuromodulatory agents 2 acetylcholine g-aminobutyric acid and pituitary ade- nylate cyclase-activating peptide are all capable of in- creasing EC-cell 5-HT release in vitro 87 92 103-106.
