A lack of nutrient availability during fasting also stimulates the synthesis and release of 5-HT from EC cells in mice due to increased transcription of Tph1 Similarly exposure of primary colonic EC cells to low glucose reflecting in vitro fasting conditions also induces TPH1 expression and increases 5-HT synthesis and release EC cells are sensitive to both acute increases and chronic reductions in glucose availability although themechanisms governing such responses remain unclear.Glucose entry to EC cells through the Na-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 has been suggested as a potential pathway for glucose-stimulated 5-HT secretion in BONFigure 2.

In contrast activation of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors augments the respiratory capacity and mem- brane excitability of pancreatic islet cells to exert an incretinlike effect by increasing insulin secretion from b cells while suppressing glucagon release from a cells through activation of 5-HT1F receptors 61-64.

SCFAs can act in a chronic fashion on EC cells by increasing TPH1 expression and 5-HT synthesis The interaction ofSCFAs with free fatty acid receptor FFAR 2 may me- diate this response however clear evidence for this in primary EC cells has not yet been provided.EC cells respond to neuromodulatory agents 2 acetylcholine g-aminobutyric acid and pituitary ade- nylate cyclase-activating peptide are all capable of in- creasing EC-cell 5-HT release in vitro 87 92 103-106.

Almost all of the 5-HT in our bodies is synthesized in specialized enteroendocrine cells within the gastrointestinal GI mucosa called enterochromaffin EC cells.

EC cells are sensory cells that are capable of integrating cues from ingested nutrients the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiome.

These cells are scattered within the gastrointestinal GI epithelium and make up about 1 of all cells lining the GI tract.

Enterochromaffin EC cells within the GI mucosa are specialized enteroendocrine cells that syn- thesize and secrete between 90 and 95 of total body serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT They are a considerable source of this important multifunctional bioamine and constitute about half of all enteroendocrinecells.

In addition we discuss the in- volvement of altered 5-HT homeostasis in clinically important metabolic diseases and examine the evidence for EC cells as critical sensory cells within the gut.5-HT Regulates Blood Glucose and Obesity Through Effects on Hepatocyte and Adipocyte FunctionGut-derived 5-HT is a regulator of metabolism through interactions with key metabolic target tissues 1 and altered gut-derived 5-HT is related to both T2D and obesity.

Isolating and studying primary EC cells has proven difficult because EC cells are dispersed throughout the GI tract epithelial cell layer.

Although methods for the purification and culture of primary human and rodent EC cells have recently been developed 35 82 87-89 the majority of studies of EC-cell function have been undertaken in BON cells a human carcinoid EC-cell line.
