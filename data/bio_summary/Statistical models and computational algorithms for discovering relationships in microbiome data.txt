The flexibility of a finite mixture model can be thought of as an additional means of accommodating the heterogeneity of the data that cannot simply be attributed to covariates such as through a linear model and can even be superior to them Finite mixtures of the DM were developed previously for microbiome analysis to identify subgroups based on abundance similar to previously considered enterotypes 011.

It has also specifically been favoured in the context of FMMs L2 for many reasons including as a model selection criterion F2.4 ExamplesBefore analyzing our motivating data we illustrate our method using a small simulated data set.

Shaikh and J. Beyene Discovering relationships in microbiome datasuitably modelled by a DM was previously outlined LThe DM has been used in sparse variable selection 013 and been advocated as a realistic means of simulating microbiome data The DM has also been used in clustering algorithms to find structure using finite mixture models FMMs A clear advantage of using FMMs of DM is that it can be flexible for modelling compositions of OTUs in samples.

This analysis employed a variety of methods including discovering differential abundance comparing diversity and other class comparison approaches which is not the goal of our work.Twins dataThe second motivating data set is well-known in the microbiome data used to analyze stool samples of lean and obese twins and their mothers Tgrouped at the genera level The original analysis discovered compositions and phylogenic similarities varied with consanguinity.MethodologyBefore introducing the proposed method itself we first discuss the necessary technical detail of the back- ground material used to develop the method.
