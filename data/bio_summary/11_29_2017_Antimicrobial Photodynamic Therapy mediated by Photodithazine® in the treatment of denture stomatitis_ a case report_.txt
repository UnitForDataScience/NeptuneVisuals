for this reason the apdt is as feasible as nystatin and could be considered as a ds treatment by the patients and the health professional.at baseline before treatment patients showed ds type i or ii and clinical improvement of the inflammation after 6 sessions of apdt was observed.

the recovery of microorganisms was performed before treatment in- itial at the end of the treatment final and at the follow-up time intervals of 15 30 and 45 days after the end of treatments.

for most patients the cfuml values obtained in the last microbiological collection day 45 were lower than those found before the treatment initial.

three patients presented clinical resolution of ds no ds signal after apdt treatment.

patients with ds may display various symptoms including burning painful sensation change of taste and swallowing difficulty but most often are asymp- tomatic .the treatment of ds includes the use of topical and systemic anti- fungal drugs.

during apdt treatment no suffering such as discomfort or pain was reported by the patients.

for most patients the cfuml values obtained in the last microbiological collection day 45 were lower than those found before the treatment initial.

three patients presented clinical resolution of ds no ds signal after apdt treatment.

it is important to highlight that in the present investiga- tion the patients were followed by the periods of 15 30 and 45 days after the conclusion of the treatment and during these periods none of them presented neither worsening nor complication of the ds nor an- other type of infection.

therefore it is possible to suggest that this re- duction on the oral microbiota was not harmful for the commensal microbiota.in the present study it was observed that three patients presentedclinical resolution of ds no ds signal after apdt treatment.

in the literature there is a study that evaluated 6 sessions of apdt mediated by photogem 500 mgl for the treatment of 5 patients with ds .

besides that standardized photographs of the palate were taken at the same periods evaluated.from all patients submitted to apdt 3 of them were female and 2male the mean age of the patients was 63 years old and the mean age of the denture was 8 years.

standardized photographs of the palates were taken prior the treatment initial at the end final and until 45 days after the completion of treatments.
