Altogether this study indicates a prob- able association between OP accumulation and diabetic prevalence with no change in AChE activity.Chronic OP impairs glucose tolerance and induces oxidative stressSince the human studies indicate the association be- tween plasma OP residues and diabetes prevalence we examined whether chronic exposure to OP is a risk fac- tor for hyperglycemia by studying a preclinical model of OP exposure in BALBc mice.

In sum RNA-seq analysis and subsequent studies indicate that OP chronic expos- ure induces the expression of OP degradation machinery of the gut microbiome that appears to be the key mech- anism behind impaired glucose tolerance.Acetic acid produced by microbial degradation of OP induces gluconeogenesisTo understand the effect of the microbial degradation of OP on host metabolism we executed whole metabolite profiling of caecum tissue from control and MCP-fed animals.

The regression co-efficients b for direct ex- posure category were 3.8 x 10-3 P  0.01 2.1 x 10-3 P 0.05 7.2 x 10-7 P  0.08 and 2.4 x 10-4 P  0.01 forMCP CHL MAL and MAPR respectively.

Alterations in ecology and physiology of gut microbiota affects the host metabolism and thereby determines the transition between health and disease including diabetes For instance gut microbiota was proven to mediate the glucose in- tolerance induced by non-caloric artificial sweeteners Thus the present study is designed to explore the effect of chronic OP exposure on glucose homeostasis and to identify the role of gut microbiota in OP-induced hyperglycemia.ResultsPlasma OP residues associated with human diabetes Based on the survey executed among the pesticide users including pesticide applicators farmers and pesticide sellersinthevillagesofVadapalanjiPanchayat Additional file Figure S1 we found OP constitutes nearly 50 of insecticide usage Additional file FigureS2A Additional file Table S1.

Collect- ively these results indicate that acetic acid was produced by the gut microbial degradation of OP and thereby glu- coneogenesis was induced in intestine and liver.Fecal acetate and esterase activity correlates with OP residues and human diabetic statusTo examine the prevalence of a similar phenomenon of gut microbiota-dependent OP-induced hyperglycemia in humans we collected fecal samples from control n 60 and diabetic people n  60 in the same population that studied for OP residues Additional file Table S8.

A linear regression between OP residues and fecal esterase activity indicates the induction of the expression of OP degrading genes in OP environment and this is evi- denced by the increased fecal acetate observed in the diabetic samples.
