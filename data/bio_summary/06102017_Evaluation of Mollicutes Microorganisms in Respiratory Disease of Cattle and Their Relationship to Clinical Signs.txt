mendonca ribeiro l. miranda marques j. timenetsky and l. gregorybackground bovine respiratory disease brd is an important problem in cattle production that is responsible for eco- nomic losses in dairy herds.

molli- cutes p  .035 and m. dispar p  .036 were more common in brd cattle.

mycoides sc has never been detected in brazilian cattle although its detection in the external auditory meatus of clinically healthy goats was described else- where.11 m. bovis is an opportunistic bacterium consid- ered part of the bovine respiratory tract microbiota.12 after stressful situations m. bovis becomes pathogenic and clinical signs of brd are observed especially in young calves.13 m. dispar was first isolated from pneu- monic lungs of cattle14 and it has been described as a potential pathogen associated with brd.1516considering the importance of mycoplasma spp.

in thedevelopment of brd the aim of our study was to evalu- ate the occurrence of the most important mycoplasma species in the lower respiratory tract of healthy and sick brazilian cattle in relationship to clinical signs of brd.materials and methodsthe study was conducted at the internal medicine department school of veterinary medicine and animal science university of sao paulo and at the laboratory of mycoplasmas institute of biological sciences university of sao paulo brazil.

all proce- dures were carried out in agreement with the guidelines of ethical principles in animal research adopted by the ethic committee on the use of animals of the school of veterinary medicine and ani- mal science of university of sao paulo.sixty young dairy cattle were randomly selected and enrolled in the study.

fifty-eight cattle were from 10 farms located in the stateof sao paulo brazil.

two cattle were presented at the veterinary hospital of the school of veterinary medicine and animal science university of sao paulo.case definitionbovine respiratory disease was diagnosed when the animal showed 2 of the following clinical signs mucopurulent or purulent nasal discharge cough rectal temperature 39.5degc res- piratory rate 40 breathsmin and increased cranioventral lung sounds or crackle.61718 the limits of the lung field were 12deg intercostal space at iliac line and 11deg intercostal space at sciatic line.

two experienced veterinarians on our research team per- formed the physical examinations in all cattle.

animals were allocated in 2 groups healthy n  28 and brd cattle n  32.sample collectionthe distal part of the neck was shaved and decontaminated with 70 alcohol and iodopovidone.
