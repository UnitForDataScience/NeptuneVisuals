Inulin-type fructans added to foods and beverages may modestly decrease serum triacylglycerols.Using colonic experimental colitis animal model induced by dextran sulfate sodium the effects of consumption of a diet high in red meat with adding the resistant starch were examined and the addition of resistant starch exhibited a great benefit on alleviating dextran sulfate sodium plus red meat induced inflammation indicating that improvement of colonic colitis by resistant starch attributes to its function of anti-inflammation 18.Dietary treatment on patients who have impaired fasting glucose impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with resistant starch reduced fasting insulin and insulin resistance postprandial glucose and insulin levels 19.

Dietary resistant starch enhances population of Ruminococcus Bromii in gut microbio- ta increases the concentration of short-chain fatty acids improves microbial metabolism and increases insulin sensitivity.Cell signaling pathways related to physiological effect of resistant starchA fairly amount of studies has been focused on the cell signaling pathways related to the physiological effect of resistant starch.

Functionally the resistant starch diet group had a lower enterocyte injury score than did control mice and this was associated with increased abundance of butyrate producers including Incertae sedis XIV Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae demonstrating the microbiota alterations induced by resistant starch 46.As previously mentioned resistant starch treatment is associated with increased guthormones peptide YY PYY and glucagon-like peptide 1 GLP-1 Vidrine et al.

This resistant starch diet decreased fatty acid intake and synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation and glycerol-phospholipid synthesis 14.Bean another form of resistant starch led to decrease in energy intake waist circumference systolic blood pressure and HbA1c and to improvements in blood glucose control and insulin sensitivity 15.

A study in a single- blinded randomized parallel nutritional intervention for 20 insulin resistant subjects has demonstrated therapeutic effect of resistant starch treatment by showing improved insulin sensitivity waist circumference and fat storage in tibialis muscle 20.

Furthermore the fractional synthesis rate in the pancreas spleen duodenum jejunum ileum and colon in a corn group were much higher in high level resistant starch treated group compared to low level resistant starch diet fed group 24.Tang et al.

It is clear that 3 d of intervention with resistant starch increased systemic levels of gut hormones involved in appetite regulation metabolic control and maintenance of gut barrier function as well as improved markers of glucose homoeostasis in middle-aged subjects.The effects of a diet high in resistant starch on luminal microbiota composition luminal SCFA concentrations and the expression of host genes involved in SCFA uptake SCFA signaling and satiety regulation in mucosal tissue obtained from small intestine cecum and colon were studied using 20 adult female pigs.

Cecal and colonic short-chain fatty acids concentrations were significantly greater in resistant starch-fed pigs and cecal gene expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 SLC16A1 and glucagon GCG was induced by resistant starch.

reported that high resistant starch diet significantly attenuated disease-induced interstitial fibrosis inflammation tubular damage activation of NFkB upregulation of pro-inflammatory pro-oxidant and pro-fibrotic molecules impaired Nrf2 activity down- regulation of antioxidant enzymes and disruption of colonic epithelial tight junction 21.Using IL-10-deficient IL-10-- mice as a model the effect of resistant starch on inflammation in various tissues including spleen mesenteric lymph nodes duodenum jejunum ileum and colon was evaluated 39.

This reduction in inflammation might be brought about by the resistant starch-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes.Sagar et al used a combinational approach of Bifido bacterium breve with non-digestible oligosaccharides this is resistant starch to explore their effects on airway inflammation and remodeling based on a murine ovalbumin-induced chronic asthma model 42.The combination of B. breve with non-digestible oligosaccharides suppressed pulmonary airway inflammation reduced T cell activation and mast cell degranulation modulated expression of pattern recognition receptors cytokines and transcription factors and reduced airway remodeling.
