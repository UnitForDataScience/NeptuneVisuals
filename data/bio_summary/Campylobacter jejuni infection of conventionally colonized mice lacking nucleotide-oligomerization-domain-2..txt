Two-sided probability p val- ues 0.05 were considered significant.ResultsPathogenic colonization properties in C. jejuni infected conventionally colonized NOD2-- miceIn order to investigate the role of NOD2 during C. jejuni infection of mice harboring a conventional microbiota NOD2-- and corresponding WT control mice were perorally infected with 109 CFU C. jejuni strain 81-176 on three consecutive days days 0 1 and 2.

Slightly higher percent- ages of C. jejuni infected NOD2-- mice were associated with higher commensal intestinal E. coli loads as com- pared to WT controls.Microscopic sequelae and pro-inflammatory cell responses upon C. jejuni infection of conventional NOD2-- mice Following C. jejuni infection mice of either genotype were virtually uncompromized from their clinical aspect.

Hence large intestinal IL-6 secretion as well as TNF and IL-18 mRNA levels were higher in NOD2-- as compared to WT mice upon pathogenic infection whereas C. jejuni induced colonic IL-22 down-regulation occurred in WT mice only.Translocation of intestinal commensal speciesto extra-intestinal compartments following C. jejuniinfection of conventional NOD2-- miceWe next addressed whether C. jejuni infection was asso- ciated with translocation of viable bacteria originating from the commensal intestinal microbiota to MLN and extra-intestinal compartments.

We here elucidated the role of NOD2 during murine C. jejuni infection in more detail.Results Conventionally colonized NOD2 deficient NOD2-- mice and corresponding wildtype WT counterparts were perorally infected with C. jejuni strain 81-176 on three consecutive days.

Whether NOD2 is also capable of sensing other microbial struc- tures or participates as a mere signaling partner is under current debate .In the present study we addressed the role of NOD2 in C. jejuni infection of mice harboring a conventional intestinal microbiota and surveyed potential C. jejuni induced NOD2 dependent pro-inflammatory sequelae and bacterial translocation from the commensal intesti- nal microbiota to extra-intestinal compartments.MethodsEthics statementAll animal experiments were conducted according to the European Guidelines for animal welfare 201063EU with approval of the commission for animal experiments headed by the Landesamt fur Gesundheit und Soziales LaGeSo Berlin registration number G013510.

Innate immune responses were less distinctly induced in C. jejuni infected NOD2-- versus WT mice as indicated by lower colonic numbers of neutrophils in the former.Conversely adaptive immune cell counts including T lymphocytes were higher in large intestines of NOD2-- as com- pared to WT mice that were paralleled by increased colonic IL-6 secretion and higher TNF and IL-18 mRNA expression levels in large intestines of the former.

Interestingly C. jejuni induced colitis was more pronounced in NOD2-- IL-10-- mice as compared to IL-10-- mice.

In addition NOD2 deficiency is associated with defective expression of antimicrobial peptides resulting in compro- mized pathogenic clearance by the host  .Several studies further revealed the importance of NOD2 in sensing and elimination of pathogens given that NOD2-- mice have been shown to be more suscep- tible to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium  or Listeria monocytogenes .

Notably large intestinal mRNA expression levels of mucin-2 constituting a pivotal factor involved in epithelial barrier integrity were comparable in naive and C. jejuni infected mice of either genotype.Conclusion NOD2 is involved in the well-balanced regulation of innate and adaptive pro-inflammatory immune responses of conventional mice upon C. jejuni infection.Keywords Campylobacter jejuni Nucleotide-oligomerization-domain-2 NOD2 In vivo infection Intestinal microbiota Colonization resistance IL-23IL-22IL-18 axis Pro-inflammatory immune responses Bacterial translocationBackgroundHuman Campylobacter infections are currently on the rise as indicated by increased prevalence and incidence rates in developed as well as developing countries  .

In addition innate immune responses were more pronounced in NOD2 deficient mice as indicated by an increased influx of neutrophils into the colonic mucosa and lamina propria following C. jejuni infection that was more pronounced in NOD2-- as compared to WT mice and paralleled by higher levelsof pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF.
