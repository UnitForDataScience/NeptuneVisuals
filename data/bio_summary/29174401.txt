Ampicillin resistance and GFP marker genes were P1 transduced from E. coli MG1655 latt-ampgfp  into strain E. coli MG1655 resistant to streptomycin  producing strain MG1655 GFP named MG1655 in this manuscript.

This single SNP was sufficient to confer the ability to infect strain MG1655 Figure S3 although this happened at the expense of bacteriophage replication in its original host strain LF82 decrease of nearly 100-fold without conferring highly efficient replication in strain MG1655 Figure S3.

Data are shown as titers of P10 bacteriophages recovered at day 7 A or day 24 B following their incubation in flasks in presence of coupled strains LF82  MG1655 black or LF82  MEc1 blue or MEc1  MG1655 green or all three of them red see .

Due to likeliness of coprophagy in these animals each cage was considered to have hosted a single adaptation event.Bacteriophage P10 was also independently mixed with strain LF82 or MG1655 in vitro and in conventional mice during 24 days and no plaques were ever recovered on lawns of MG1655.Bacteria and Bacteriophage QuantificationBacterial and bacteriophage samples from liquid cultures or freshly collected fecal samples were weighed and homogenized in PBS serially diluted in PBS and 4 mL of each dilution were spotted onto LB or Drigalski agar supplemented with streptomycin and kana- mycin or ampicillin for the quantification of strains LF82 or MG1655 respectively.

The resulting bacteriophage lysate was named rP10 MG. Then P10 rP10 and rP10 MG were added to exponentially growing cultures at OD6000.2 of either strains LF82  MG1655 LF82  MEc1 or MEc1  MG1655 mixed in equal proportions and at M.O.I.

The shared acquired infectivity toward strain MG1655 has a very variable effect on the global host range.

Only positive results are shown for clarity.RESULTSThe Intestinal Environment Promotes Bacteriophage Host JumpOur experimental approach involved a tripartite network consist- ing of 1 a novel virulent bacteriophage P10 related to the Myovirus Felix O1 2 its host the pathogenic Escherichia coli strain LF82 and 3 the commensal E. coli strain MG1655 to which P10 cannot bind and is therefore non-infective up to 1010 pfu were tested Figure S1.

The behavior of these three partners was monitored for 24 days in parallel in three condi- tions in vitro planktonic cultures in the gut of mice colonized only with strains LF82 and MG1655 dixenic and in the gut of conventional mice A and see Figure S2 for bacterio- phage population densities.

We screened for ''host jumps'' or in other words a gain of function by P10 the function being the ability to infect the previously insensitive host strain MG1655.

Interestingly bacterio- phage P10 variants adapted to strain MG1655 hereafter named adP10 and still infecting strain LF82 were isolated but onlyfrom the gut of conventional mice 20 rate.
