Below are reported the most important bacteria strains which aid the immune response triggered by anticancer drugs together with their mechanism of action whenever known.Probiotic bacteria strains reprogram anticancer immune responseThe most significant in vitro in vivo and clinical studies regarding the influence of probiotic bacteria strains on anticancer immune re- sponse are indicated in .Lactobacillus strainsThe majority of probiotics belong to the group of lactic acid bac- teria being Lactobacillus the most prominent probiotics members.

Instead in this review we briefly survey the up-to-date un- derstanding of how gut microbiota can affect both spontaneous immune responses or immunotherapy against various cancer types.The gut microbiota in immune homeostasis and cancerHuman intestine harbors hundred trillion organisms mainly bac- teria representing the most densely populated ecosystem known to date .

Unfortunately the above described immune response against cancer not always performs optimally thus allowing the cancer cells to escape the death.

Interestingly when Lactobacillus plantarum enriched with selenium nanoparticles SeNPs was given to a group of female mice which received concurrently a subcutaneous injection of breast cancer cells 4T1 and the administration continued throughout the experiment a more efficient immune response toward the cancer through the elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-g TNF-a and IL-2 levels and increased NK cell activity were found when com- pared to control mice .

More importantly it has been recently demonstrated that some gut bacteria strains synergize with largely-used anticancer drugs as alkylating or immune checkpoint blockade agents thus optimizing the immune response against multiple solid cancers.

In fact while the immune system shapes the gut microbiota composition the latter regulates the immune systems responses .

The latters play an important role in maintaining immune tolerance not only towards the gut microbiota but also towards dietary antigens and are also fundamental in suppressing tissue injure provoked by immune responses against pathogens e.g.

Here the advances in the understanding of how gut microbes and immune response shape each other in a cancer context are reviewed together with the implications of these finding for future antitumor therapy.
