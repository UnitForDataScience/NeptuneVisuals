The sharp enrichment of this trait in the S. officinalis microbiome followed by sediments leads us to posit that these enzymes may primarily act as anti-oxidant agents in these particular settings along with other anti-oxidant enzymes known to be enriched in sponges such as glutathione peroxidases   observed here to possess high abundance in both sponges and sediments Supplementary Table S4 IPR IPR000889.

Conversely the very dominant OTUs in seawater essentially representing a mix of Flavobacteriia Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria phylotypes were all markedly de-selected in the sponge host except for OTU 442 unculturedRhodobacteraceae the second most abundant seawater phylotype which was the 5th and 14th most abundant OTU in sediments and sponges respectively Supplementary Table S3.IPR Functional ProfilingFrom the 10272 IPRs detected throughout the functional dataset using the EMG data processing pipeline see section Materials and Methods for details 6046 were present in all biotopes whereas 234 695 and 1130 were specific to S. officinalis seawater and sediments respectively.

Because these attributes have been commonly verified in diverse sponge symbiont lineages   it can be argued that they contribute significantly to the observed difference in taxonomic assembly between sponges sediments and seawater observed here.One important finding in this study was the observation that several of the features identified as genomic signatures of the S. officinalis microbiome displayed higher abundances in sediments than in seawater.

While archaea were less represented in seawater c. 0.18 of classifiable reads than in sponges 1.6-3.9 and sediments 1.7-3.2 eukaryotic reads were slightly more abundant in the former biotope 3.11-4.36 of classifiable reads than in the latter 2.12-2.39 and 2.04-2.32 in sponges and sediments respectively.

Alternative analytical pipelines were used to verify the consistency of the major trends found and to compare the S. officinalis microbial metagenome with those of other sponge hosts.MATERIALS AND METHODSSampling and Sponge IdentificationSampling of S. officinalis specimens c. 10 g n 4 seawater 2 L n 3 and sediments c. 50 g of upper 5 cm layer n 3 took place in May 2014 by SCUBA diving at 20 m depth off the coast of Pedra da Greta 36 58 47.2N7 59 20.8W Algarve southern Portugal.

The consistent trend found here for a primarily heterotrophic less-motile community of endosymbionts highlights the need of approaching distinct microniches within marine sponges for a better understanding of microbiome spatial distributions and dynamics in these hosts  .Finally we detected much higher incidence of CRISPR-Casand restriction endonucleases in the S. officinalis microbiomethan in seawater--in accordance with earlier metagenomics surveys      --and sediments.

Future studies aiming to define the gene content of the community of circular plasmids present in marine sponges will certainly shed new light on the functional features more likely to traffic about in the mobile gene pool within the Porifera.Physical connectivity between sponges and sediments although usually given less importance in microbiology studies than seawater intake via filtering takes place by the capture of particulate organic matter and particles in suspension by the sponge host  .
