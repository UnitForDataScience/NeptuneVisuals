All rights reserved.IntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome IBS refers to a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder currently defined by the Rome III criteria including abdominal pain or dis- comfort associated with altered bowel habits without or- ganic abnormalities 1.

In summary according to the hypothesis that abdominal paindiscomfort results from a visceral hypersensitivity in IBS we expect that our study demonstrates that the present mixture of probiotic strains of L. acidophilus significantly reduced abdominal pain and improved oth- ers secondary endpoints such as other IBS symptoms and bowel habits.Limitations of the studyIn order to confirm the efficacy of probiotics as a well-established therapeutic approach in the manage- ment of IBS symptoms further investigations will be needed by performing other large-scale studies in ac- cordance with EFSA guidance to evidence health-claimsrelated to gastrointestinal discomfort or bowel function 36.

Thus the aim of the current study is to test with the highest methodology the hypothesis that a consumption for 8 weeks of a mixture of two L. acido- philus probiotic strains selected for their strain-specific properties could result in an improvement of abdominal paindiscomfort as well as other IBS symptoms such as bloating flatus rumbling and bowel habits including stool frequency and consistencyappearance.Materials and Methods Trial designThe design of this protocol refers to a multicentredouble-blind placebo-controlled two-armed parallel design individually randomized trial comparing pro- biotics with placebo in patients with IBS.

The study design was also adaptive with an interim analysis after the first sixty patients were included 75 of the overall participants providing enough accuracy according to the positive results of a previous RCT us- ing probiotics in 60 IBS patients 4.
