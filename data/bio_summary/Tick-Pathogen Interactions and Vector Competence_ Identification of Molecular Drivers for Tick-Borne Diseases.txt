With respect to the tick innate immune responsephagocytophilum subverts tick RNAi by mechanisms other than reduction of Tudor staphylococcal nuclease Tudor-SN levels to preserve a protein that is important for tick feeding Ayllon et al.

Identification of interactions that promote tick survival spread and pathogen transmission provides the opportunity to disrupt these interactions and lead to a reduction in tick burden and the prevalence of tick-borne diseases.

These genetic determinants affect traits such as tick host preferences duration of tick attachment tick-host-pathogen and microbiome-pathogen interactions and susceptibility to pathogen infection Ramamoorthi et al.

Together with tools such as tick cell lines and the widespread adaptation of RNA interference RNAi to study tick gene function Bell- Sakyi et al.

In the absence of transovarial passage ticks must acquire infection in each generation during a bloodmeal.phagocytophilum initially infects tick midgut cells and then subsequently develops in the salivary glands for transmission to susceptible hosts during tick feeding.

In the tick spirochetes colonize the midgut and then traverse into the hemocoel and migrate to salivary glands for transmission during tick feeding Pal et al.

The type IV secretion system T4SS was proposed to be involved in the secretion of HSP70 and theMSP4 interaction with tick cells may induce the secretion of vesicles at the phagocytic cup to aid in adhesin secretion for rickettsial infection of tick cells Villar et al.

An important protein involved in spirochete colonization of the tick midgut is the outer surface protein A OspA which binds to the tick receptor for OspA TROSPA Pal et al.

An I. scapularis dystroglycan like protein ISDLP as well as a tick receptor for the B. burgdorferi protein BBE31 TRE31 help spirochetes traverse from the tick midgut into the hemocoel Zhang L. et al.

burgdorferi outer surface protein C OspC produced when bacteria leave the tick midgut binds to tick salivary protein 15 Salp15 Ramamoorthi et al.
