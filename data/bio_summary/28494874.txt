Foremost both the poor-prognosis stroma tumors and good-prognosis SSC tumors were enriched in gene sets associated with ''immune pro- cesses'' and exhibited high T cell infiltration as evaluated by both RNA-seq D and DNA methylation profiling  E. However SSC tumors were enriched in transcripts defining active cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells and depleted in transcripts associated with an activated ''stroma'' and ''immunesuppression'' whereas the reverse pattern was observed in poor-prognosis stroma tumors D. A relative enrichment of stromal cells such as myofibroblasts IMR90 and mesen- chymal stem cells MSCs in stroma tumors was observed by RNA-seq D and confirmed by DNA methylation analysis E. The CIN and dARE tumors were instead relatively depleted in gene sets associated with both stromal and immune activity in particular IFN-ag signaling and T cells again seen in both RNA-seq D and DNA methylation data E. Finally the goblet tumor TME was most similar to normal mucosa as evaluated by PCA of stromal transcripts Figure S3A and characterized by high expression of immunoglobulin A IGHA1 and IGHA2 the principal antibody of normal intestine A.Interestingly we found that the tumor archetype distribution differed between public CRC cohorts F which had been subtyped into tumor archetypes using our ''CRCclassifier'' Figure S3B.

This identified five tumor archetypes denoted ''goblet'' ''stroma'' ''SSC'' ''dARE'' and ''CIN'' A and S2A see Figure S2B for distribution of tumor archetypes according to TNM stage gender location and MSI status which were validated in the two independent CRC cohorts as described above for the CC archetypes B S2C S2D S2E and S2F.

The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA cohorts ''COAD'' ''READ'' ''BLAD'' BRAD'' ''LUAD'' and ''PRAD'' were acquired as level 3 processed data matrixes for RNA-seqV2 data from the TCGA portal .

Finally the in- clusion of stromal transcripts identified two tumor archetypes ''dARE'' and ''CIN'' that both belonged to the adsorptive CC archetype and shared features characteristic of conventional CRC such as CIN A.

For stroma tumors we combined three biomarker panels for enhanced EMT DNA methylation loss and reduced IFN-g signaling for SSC tumors we combined three biomarker panels for enhanced EMT stromal stem cell STC activity and reduced IFN-g signaling and for CIN tumors four biomarker panels for reduced RETOxphosperipheral blood mononuclear cell PBMCIFN-g signaling were combined for details on how the composite panels were derived see Supplemental Experimental Procedures section ''Establishment of archetype-specific prog- nostic biomarker panels and calculation of panel scores'' the relevant gene sets are marked with asterisk in A.

We divided the TNM stage II-III tumors from the SYSCOL and GSE39582 cohorts into aggressive CRC relapseCRC-related death and non-aggressive groups no relapse or CRC-related death within the stroma SSC and CIN archetypes and compared aggressive and non-aggressive sam- ples by GSEA the goblet and dARE archetype tumors were excluded from this analysis due to low numbers of relapsing cases.

We next validated the P-scores in samples from independent public cohorts sufficiently sized for archetype-specific analysis of RFS A right panels cohorts were combined to increase num- ber of relapse events in each cohort see Supplemental Experi- mental Procedures section ''Relapse-free survival analysis and samples included'' here the CIN panel could be evaluated in more validation cohorts than the SSC and stroma panels due to the higher frequency of the CIN archetype.

In agreement a biomarker panel based on the top ten enricheddepleted EMT- related transcripts in aggressive stroma tumors were prognostic only in stroma tumors and not SSC tumors and vice versa  C and S5B.
