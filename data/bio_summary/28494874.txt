foremost both the poor-prognosis stroma tumors and good-prognosis ssc tumors were enriched in gene sets associated with ''immune pro- cesses'' and exhibited high t cell infiltration as evaluated by both rna-seq d and dna methylation profiling  e. however ssc tumors were enriched in transcripts defining active cytotoxic cd4 and cd8 t cells and depleted in transcripts associated with an activated ''stroma'' and ''immunesuppression'' whereas the reverse pattern was observed in poor-prognosis stroma tumors d. a relative enrichment of stromal cells such as myofibroblasts imr90 and mesen- chymal stem cells mscs in stroma tumors was observed by rna-seq d and confirmed by dna methylation analysis e. the cin and dare tumors were instead relatively depleted in gene sets associated with both stromal and immune activity in particular ifn-ag signaling and t cells again seen in both rna-seq d and dna methylation data e. finally the goblet tumor tme was most similar to normal mucosa as evaluated by pca of stromal transcripts figure s3a and characterized by high expression of immunoglobulin a igha1 and igha2 the principal antibody of normal intestine a.interestingly we found that the tumor archetype distribution differed between public crc cohorts f which had been subtyped into tumor archetypes using our ''crcclassifier'' figure s3b.

this identified five tumor archetypes denoted ''goblet'' ''stroma'' ''ssc'' ''dare'' and ''cin'' a and s2a see figure s2b for distribution of tumor archetypes according to tnm stage gender location and msi status which were validated in the two independent crc cohorts as described above for the cc archetypes b s2c s2d s2e and s2f.

finally the p-score also provided prognostic information additional to msi status a well-established marker of favorable prognosis  in the patient sam- ples for which tumor msimss status was available figure s6d.adiscovery cohortsvalida on cohortsrfs st.ii-iii stroma syscolrfs st.ii-iii stroma gse39582rfs st.ii-iii stroma gse17538rfs st.ii-iii stroma gse37892pval  0.00110 20 40 60 80 100time monthsp-stroma 1.05 n 12p-stroma 1.05 n 17rfs st.ii-iii ssc syscolpval  0050100150200time monthsp-stroma 1.05 n 21p-stroma 1.05 n 33rfs st.ii-iii ssc gse395820 20 40 60 80 100time monthsp-stroma 1.05 n 11p-stroma 1.05 n 21rfs st.ii-iii ssc gse17538gse14333pval  0.0372020406080time monthsp-stroma 1.05 n 9p-stroma 1.05 n 15rfs st.ii-iii ssc gse37892gse13294pval  0.0006050100150time monthsp-ssc 1.05 n 15p-ssc 1.05 n 29rfs st.ii-iii cin syscolpval  0.0004050100150200time monthsp-ssc 1.05 n 34p-ssc 1.05 n 54rfs st.ii-iii cin gse39582pval  0.0278020 40 60 80 100time monthsp-ssc 1.05 n 15p-ssc 1.05 n 26rfs st.ii-iii cin gse17538gse14333pval  0.0163050 time month1s00 150p-ssc 1.05 n 28p-ssc 1.05 n 36rfs st.ii-iii cin gse37892rfs st.ii-iii cin gse41258rfs st.ii-iii cin gse13294pval  0.0059050100150time monthsp-cin 1.05 n30p-cin 1.05 n55b stroma-ssc-cin all cohortspval  0050100150200time monthsp-cin 1.05 n58p-cin 1.05 n 94pval  0.0227050100150time monthsp-cin 1.05 n 23p-cin 1.05 n 33pval  0.01420 20 40 60 80 100time monthsp-cin 1.05 n 24p-cin 1.05 n 39pval  0.0453050100150time monthsp-cin 1.05 n 11p-cin 1.05 n 17pval  0.0066050100time monthsp-cin 1.05 n 18p-cin 1.05 n 29stroma syscol stroma gse39582 stroma gse17538 stroma gse37892 ssc syscol cdiscovery cohorts n438dunivariate analysis mul variate analysisp-val.

finally the in- clusion of stromal transcripts identified two tumor archetypes ''dare'' and ''cin'' that both belonged to the adsorptive cc archetype and shared features characteristic of conventional crc such as cin a. notably we found that patients with stroma archetype tumors had shorter rfs than other patients particularly the ssc tumor patients in the gse39582 and syscol-gse41258 cohorts c and s2h.

the cancer genome atlas tcga cohorts ''coad'' ''read'' ''blad'' brad'' ''luad'' and ''prad'' were acquired as level 3 processed data matrixes for rna-seqv2 data from the tcga portal .

we next validated the p-scores in samples from independent public cohorts sufficiently sized for archetype-specific analysis of rfs a right panels cohorts were combined to increase num- ber of relapse events in each cohort see supplemental experi- mental procedures section ''relapse-free survival analysis and samples included'' here the cin panel could be evaluated in more validation cohorts than the ssc and stroma panels due to the higher frequency of the cin archetype.

for stroma tumors we combined three biomarker panels for enhanced emt dna methylation loss and reduced ifn-g signaling for ssc tumors we combined three biomarker panels for enhanced emt stromal stem cell stc activity and reduced ifn-g signaling and for cin tumors four biomarker panels for reduced retoxphosperipheral blood mononuclear cell pbmcifn-g signaling were combined for details on how the composite panels were derived see supplemental experimental procedures section ''establishment of archetype-specific prog- nostic biomarker panels and calculation of panel scores'' the relevant gene sets are marked with asterisk in a. each of these three composite biomarker panels generated a panel score p-score which were denoted p-stroma p-ssc and p-cin for the stroma ssc and cin archetypes respectively.

enrichment in the stroma archetype had a low rms in the ssc archetype and vice versa b. in agreement a biomarker panel based on the top ten enricheddepleted emt- related transcripts in aggressive stroma tumors were prognostic only in stroma tumors and not ssc tumors and vice versa  c and s5b.

we divided the tnm stage ii-iii tumors from the syscol and gse39582 cohorts into aggressive crc relapsecrc-related death and non-aggressive groups no relapse or crc-related death within the stroma ssc and cin archetypes and compared aggressive and non-aggressive sam- ples by gsea the goblet and dare archetype tumors were excluded from this analysis due to low numbers of relapsing cases.

it should be stressed that the identification of the dare archetype also proved essential to our prognostication strategy we were unable to validate cin subtype-specific prognostic biomarkers if the transcriptionally extreme dare tumors were not separated from the cin tumors data not shown.our dual class discovery approach also helped illustrate that the tme rather than the cc archetype is a major determinant of patient prognosis both between and within tumor archetypes.
