Thus in the NCS bioaugmented samples DT90s varied from 8.5 12 mg kg-1 to 33.9 days 400 mg kg-1 compared to the corresponding ACS bioaugmented samples where DT90s ranged from 7.8 days 12 mg kg-1 to 14.6 days 400 mg kg-1 .The impact of bioaugmentation and TBZ contamination on theiversity of the soil bacterial communityThe a-diversity of the bacterial community in the different samples of the NCS was calculated Simpsons Shannon-Wiener and Evenness indices based on the amplicon sequencing dataTable 2The dissipation kinetic parameters of thiabendazole TBZ in samples of naturally contaminated soil NCS or artificially contaminated soil ACS which were bio- augmented Bio or not bioaugmented NBio with a TBZ-degrading consortium.Soil treatmentsParametersobtained Supplementary Table 2.

Soil samples collected from transects B 400 mg kg-1 and D 12 mg kg-1 TBZ showed similar bacterial b-diversity which was drastically different from the composition of the bacterial community in the soil samples from transect A high contamination level - 12000 mg kg-1.

In ACS samples amended with 12 250 and 400 mg kg-1 TBZ bioaugmentation drastically accelerated the dissipation of TBZ with DT90 values of 7.8 10.9 and14.6 days respectively compared to DT90s of 365 105.5 and 191.9 days in the respective non bioaugmented samples a b c. A similar pattern was observed in the NCS where bio- augmentation of samples contaminated with 12 250 and400 mg kg-1 TBZ resulted in DT90s of 8.5 12 mg kg-1 28.7 250 mg kg-1 and 33.9 400 mg kg-1 days compared to DT90 of250 days in the corresponding non bioaugmented NCS samples a b c .

We showed using high-throughput amplicon sequencing which could record the response of the rare members of the soil bacterial community  that the soil bioaugmentation with the TBZ-degrading consortium is not ex- pected to induce drastic changes in the soil bacterial community.TBZ contamination level was the key factor driving the composition of the bacterial community in the NCS.

Regarding a-diversity in the other two transects B and D a significant increase was evident at 56 days Supplementary Table 2.The impact of bioaugmentation and TBZ contamination on theb-diversity of the soil bacterial communityThe bacterial community in the examined soil samples was composed of 1605 distinct OTUs.

At the order level the soils from transect A and B showed similar composition with dominant members belonging to the orders Rubrobacterales Micrococcales Gemmatimonadales Planctomycetales Cytophagales Bacillales Rhi-zobiales and Acidobacteriales b.When the b-diversity of bacteria in the samples from transect A was determined a dramatically different bacterial community compared to the soils from transects B and D was observed .Regardless of bioaugmentation and sampling time Proteobacteria dominated the bacterial community in transect A relative abun- dance 81.4e91.3 average 86.9 .

Multivariate statistical analysis showed that regardless of time and bioaugmentation the bacterial community in the most contaminated soil samples transect A was unique and clearly distinct from the bacterial community in transects B and D. This was a reflection of the dominance of Proteobacteria in the soil from transect A at the expense of Actinobacteria Gemmatimonadetes Acidobacteria and Firmicutes which were most impacted by the high contamination levels of TBZ.

In addition we determined the total bacterial growth during degradation of TBZ by i q-PCR using bacterial universal primers 338f  and 518r  as described by ii OD600 measurements and iii dilution plating on LB Supplementary Fig.

In a parallel study showed that pollution of soil with a cocktail of aromatic pollutants resulted in a consistent reduction in the a-diversity of soil bacteria.Analysis of the b-diversity of the bacterial community in the NCSshowed that it was dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in accordance with previous studies reporting bacterial diversity in other contaminated sites  .
