thus in the ncs bioaugmented samples dt90s varied from 8.5 12 mg kg-1 to 33.9 days 400 mg kg-1 compared to the corresponding acs bioaugmented samples where dt90s ranged from 7.8 days 12 mg kg-1 to 14.6 days 400 mg kg-1 .the impact of bioaugmentation and tbz contamination on theiversity of the soil bacterial communitythe a-diversity of the bacterial community in the different samples of the ncs was calculated simpsons shannon-wiener and evenness indices based on the amplicon sequencing datatable 2the dissipation kinetic parameters of thiabendazole tbz in samples of naturally contaminated soil ncs or artificially contaminated soil acs which were bio- augmented bio or not bioaugmented nbio with a tbz-degrading consortium.soil treatmentsparametersobtained supplementary table 2. manova analysis showed that the level of contamination had the strongest effect p  0.001 on bacterial a-diversity followed by time p  0.05 while bio- augmentation as a main factor did not induce significant effects.

soil samples collected from transects b 400 mg kg-1 and d 12 mg kg-1 tbz showed similar bacterial b-diversity which was drastically different from the composition of the bacterial community in the soil samples from transect a high contamination level - 12000 mg kg-1.

regarding a-diversity in the other two transects b and d a significant increase was evident at 56 days supplementary table 2.the impact of bioaugmentation and tbz contamination on theb-diversity of the soil bacterial communitythe bacterial community in the examined soil samples was composed of 1605 distinct otus.

gemmatimonadetes were abun- dant in transects b and d with their relative abundance increasing significantly at 56-day 4.9e13.9 average 8.2. acidobacteria 4.0e8.3 average 6.4 firmicutes 3.4e5.8 average 4.5 chloroflexi 2.2e3.4 average 2.8 and planctomycetes 0.6e2.5 average 1.4 were also detected at levels  1. at the class level a- proteobacteria was the most abundant class of proteobacteria with their relative abundance showing a reduction with time 51.5e82.2 average 70.7. in contrast g-proteobacteria 5.1e31.5 average 11.3 d-proteobacteria 6.4e19.3 average 10.4 and b-proteobacteria 4.4e14.4 average 7.3 showed an opposite temporal trend a. at the order level the soils from transect a and b showed similar composition with dominant members belonging to the orders rubrobacterales micrococcales gemmatimonadales planctomycetales cytophagales bacillales rhi-zobiales and acidobacteriales b.when the b-diversity of bacteria in the samples from transect a was determined a dramatically different bacterial community compared to the soils from transects b and d was observed .regardless of bioaugmentation and sampling time proteobacteria dominated the bacterial community in transect a relative abun- dance 81.4e91.3 average 86.9 .

b-proteobacteria was the second most abun- dant proteobacterial class 17.8e43.4 average 28.4 a. a- proteobacteria showed a lower relative abundance in the highly contaminated samples of transect a 7.9e20.6 average 14.7 while the relative abundance of d-proteobacteria was below 0.5. at the order level bacteria of the orders burkholderiales b-pro- teobacteria and pseudomonadales g-proteobacteria dominated the soil bacterial community in transect a while rhizobiales was the most resilient order of the a-proteobacteria b. xantho- monadales g-proteobacteria and shingobacteriales bacteroidetes showed a significant increase in their relative abundance from 14 days onwards.hierarchical clustering grouped samples into two distinctgroups.

the first cluster comprised all samples collected from transect a whereas the second cluster comprised all samples collected from transects b and d a. within each cluster samples were ordinated according to time.

we showed using high-throughput amplicon sequencing which could record the response of the rare members of the soil bacterial community  that the soil bioaugmentation with the tbz-degrading consortium is not ex- pected to induce drastic changes in the soil bacterial community.tbz contamination level was the key factor driving the composition of the bacterial community in the ncs.

multivariate statistical analysis showed that regardless of time and bioaugmentation the bacterial community in the most contaminated soil samples transect a was unique and clearly distinct from the bacterial community in transects b and d. this was a reflection of the dominance of proteobacteria in the soil from transect a at the expense of actinobacteria gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and firmicutes which were most impacted by the high contamination levels of tbz.

in addition we determined the total bacterial growth during degradation of tbz by i q-pcr using bacterial universal primers 338f  and 518r  as described by ii od600 measurements and iii dilution plating on lb supplementary fig.

bacterial inoculum was harvested at 50 h which coincided with near complete degradation of tbz and the maximum density of both the sphingomonas phy- lotype and the total bacterial community supplementary fig.

error bars in each point represent the standard deviation of the mean.further two-way anova revealed that soil samples collected from transect a exhibited the lowest a-diversity of the soil bacterial community which did not recover with time.

three otus 9 2 and 5 contributed 64.64 to the similarity of the bacterial community in the samples of transect a. otu 9 belonged to b-proteobacteria order bur- kholderiales genus advenella and contributed 23.9. otus 2 and 5 belonged to g-proteobacteria order pseudomonadales genusfig.
