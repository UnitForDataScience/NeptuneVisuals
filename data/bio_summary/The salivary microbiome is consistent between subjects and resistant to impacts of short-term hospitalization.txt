Together the higher sequence diversity detected by V1V2 and the known limitations of V4V5 from our mock community analysis suggest that the V1V2 region may be preferable for analysis of the salivary microbiome.When we compared the beta diversity of both regions we found that the average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between samples was significantly higher when using the V1V2 region compared to the V4V5 region Fig.

We found that the Simpson diversity was considerably higher for the V1V2 region in comparison to the V4V5 region indicating that V1V2 was superior in detecting the evenness of our community and suggesting that V1V2 is better suited to analyze communities of oral bacteria Fig.

D Theoretical and observed relative abundances of genera detected in HM-783D using the V1V2 and V4V5 hypervariable regions.this further suggests that the V4V5 may not accurately represent the true proportions of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity.V1V2 is preferred for salivary microbiome analysis.

Similarly the V1V2 dataset was dominated by a small number of genera using V1V2 however we could detect Staphylococcus - a major component of the HM-783D mock community that was undetected using V4V5 Fig.

We believe this observation stems from our earlier finding that the V1V2 region can detect more unique ribosomal sequence variants in comparison to V4V5 indicating that V1V2 is more sensitive to differences in community structure between samples.

As was the case with the even community both V1V2 and V4V5 overrepresented Neisseria relative to its true propor- tions however this effect was more dramatic for V4V5.

Therefore it is evident that the oral microbiome is a major determinant of oral and possibly overall health.While its link to oral health is well established studies suggest that the oral microbiome may be important in systemic diseases as well.

Our preliminary data using the HMP mock community suggested that the V1V2 region can detect more unique taxa within the mock community.

When analyzing the even mock community we found that the V1V2 region was able to better cap- ture the true community composition Fig.
