Such relationships define the very existence of the forest types and dictate the physiochemical properties of these ecosystems.Any effort to evaluate the impact of land-use and changes to the natural forest ecosystem warrants an in-depth investigation across a gradient of forest types such as primary forest second- ary forestlogged forest and oil palm plantation.

This study reports the changes in bacterial community structure in organ- ic soil 0-5 cm O-Horizon and organic-mineral soil 5- 15 cm A-Horizon across Maliau Basin Conservation Area old growth forest MBOG Fragment E logged forest FELF located in Kalabakan Forest Reserve to Benta Wawasan oil palm plantation BWOP using two-step PCR amplicon anal- ysis of bacteria DNA on Illumina Miseq next generation se- quencing.

Rapid rates of forest conversion and degradation have prompted intergovernmental agreements between Indonesia Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam to pro- tect and sustainably use the forests that remain in Borneo via Heart of Borneo Initiative.To date 5.8 million ha of tropical forest in Borneo has been converted for agriculture especially for oil palm Elates guineensis plantation because of the increasing global demand for cheaper sources of oil for food and biofuel  .

Timber extraction result- ed in conversion of habitat from primary forest to secondary forest which was then further degraded-fragmented for ag- ricultural purposes primarily for the monocultures of oil palm .Land-use change significantly affects the balance and sta- bility of biodiversity and ecosystem processes.

Bacteria community structure of pristine forest logged forest and oil palm plantation has been studied    but has only focused on topsoil bacterial community structure at the phylum level.

This study reports on the dynamics of vertical gradients in bacterial community in the top organic soil layer 0-5 cm O-Horizonand the organic-mineral soil layer 5-15 cm A-Horizon across land-use gradients at species level .Materials and MethodsStudy Area The study was based in the Belian Plot of the Maliau Basin Conservation Area 4deg 44' N 116deg 58' E which is old growth forest dominated numerically by large Dipterocarpaceae and has never been logged referred to as Maliau Basin old growth forest.

A total of 45 soil cores were collected from old growth forest 15 soil cores logged forest 15 soil cores and oil palm plantation 15 soil cores.

Organic layer soils from Maliau Basin old growth forest MBOG are dominated by Proteobacteria 30.3 while Actinobacteria dominate in Fragment E logged forest FELF and Benta Wawasan oil palm planta- tion BWOP with 30.5 and 29.3 respectively Fig.
