We briefly introduce compositional data illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.Keywords microbiota compositional data high-throughput sequencing correlation Bayesian estimation count normalization relative abundanceINTRODUCTIONThe collection and analysis of microbiome datasets presents many challenges in the study design sample collection storage and sequencing phases and these have been well reviewed Robinson et al.

Many methods for the analysis of microbiome datasets assume that sequencing data are equivalent to ecological data where the counts of reads assigned to organisms are often normalized to a constant area or volume.

Compositional data have a negative correlation bias and a different correlation structure than the underlying count data.

Taking the logarithm of these ratios thus log-ratios makes the data symmetric and linearly related and places the data in a log-ratio coordinate space Pawlowsky-Glahn et al.

These latter two metrics have been incorporated into the R package propr that includes an adaptation allowing the calculation of the metrics with sparse data that gives an expected value of r Er that approaches 1 if the two features have exactly constant ratios in the data Lovell et al.

However many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data.

The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis.

Data that are naturally described as proportions or probabilities or with a constant or irrelevant sum are referred to as compositional data.

Compositional data contains information about the relationships between the parts Aitchison 1986 Pawlowsky-Glahn et al.

We can see the difference between counts and compositions by comparing the data for the actual counts for three samples in the top barplot with their proportions in the bottom barplot.
