When vitamin D was combined with calcium supplementation a lowered risk of preeclampsia was found but this was accompanied by an increased risk of preterm birth Additional high-quality evidence from randomized trials is still needed to ascertain the magnitude of benefit that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy can provide for mothers and their children.Adolescent nutrition interventionsSpecial consideration must be made for the effec- tiveness of nutritional interventions in adolescent206Volume 20  Number 3  May 2017Improvement of maternal and child nutrition Vaivada et al.populations 29 This is particularly salient for girls who are entering reproductive age whose food intake may be insufficient to meet the metabolic demands both of their own growth and those of a fetus.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2015 11CD004905.The meta-analyses provide the most recent available data on the effect of antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation on birth outcomes potentially informing a change in WHO recommendations on iron-folic acid supplements.Prado EL Adu-Afarwuah S Lartey A et al.

Current WHO recommendations call for daily supplementation with a combination of 30-60 mg iron and 400 mg folic acid or weekly supplementation with 120 mg iron and 2800 mg folic acid whereas evidence1363-1950 Copyright c 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health Inc.

Recent meta-analyses have determined that in areas where services for the prevention and management of malaria are available iron provision does not increase the risk of clinical malaria Although not as effective as daily supplementation intermit- tent iron supplementation in children may be suf- ficient in areas where daily supplementation is not feasible .

Sialylated oligosaccharides found in breastmilk modulate the infant microbiome and their absence has been found to be associated with severe under- nutrition 65 lending further support for the crucial importance of breastfeeding for the estab- lishment of a healthy microbiome and the preven- tion of malnutrition.Vitamin D supplementationA Cochrane review of vitamin D supplementation interventions for the prevention of infections in young children identified four randomized trials only one of which was conducted in an LMIC setting208Volume 20  Number 3  May 2017Improvement of maternal and child nutrition Vaivada et al.with a very high level of vitamin D deficiency Afghanistan There was no conclusive benefit of vitamin D on the incidence of diarrhea or pneu- monia CONCLUSIONOur review indicates that the global evidence base for nutrition interventions continues to expand including new evidence that strengthens existing recommendations and lends support for the uptake of new interventions.

Similarly the relationship between early nutrition and early child development is well established and recent data underscore the importance of invest- ments in maternal and child nutrition interventions to address human capital a key strategy for the next 'Decade of Nutrition' AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Renee Sharma and Mahdis Kamali for their support in the preparation of this study.Financial support and sponsorshipThis work was supported in part by UNICEF New York USA.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.REFERENCES AND RECOMMENDED READINGPapers of particular interest published within the annual period of review havebeen highlighted asof special interest of outstanding interestLiu L Oza S Hogan D et al.
