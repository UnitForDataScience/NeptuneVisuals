Such alterations may in turn change the relation between the host and the resident microbiota from symbiosis to dysbiosis thereby fueling initiation and progression of periodontitis and dental caries.Saliva is the biological fluid of the oral cavity which is critical for maintenance of oral and general health.Therefore saliva has been intensively investigated for candidate biomarkers associated with oral health and disease.Saliva is sterile when entering the oral cavity but when sampled saliva contains a diverse microbiota.In healthy oral conditions the composition of the salivary microbiota is different from that of supragingival and subgingival biofilms.On the other hand the presence of specific bacterial species in saliva such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans has been reported in individuals with periodontitis and dental caries respectively.Essentially these findings suggest that bacteria from local periodontitis and caries lesions may be spilled-over and dispersed into saliva.

ARTICLEOPENMetagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of saliva reveals disease-associated microbiota in patients with periodontitis and dental cariesDaniel Belstrom1 Florentin Constancias2 Yang Liu2 Liang Yang 2 Daniela I. Drautz-Moses2 Stephan C. Schuster2 Gurjeet Singh Kohli2 Tim Holm Jakobsen3 Palle Holmstrup1 and Michael Givskov23INTRODUCTIONPeriodontitis and dental caries are the two most prevalent oral diseases and the primary causes of tooth loss in the western world.At present periodontitis and dental caries are mostly diagnosed at late stages of disease often leading to costly and invasive dental treatment.

So far only a few studies have reported higher expression of specific bacterial genes to associate with dental caries.In addition the potential of using comprehensive metatranscrip- tomic microbial analysis of saliva to identify possible biomarkershas not yet been evaluated.1Section for Periodontology and Oral Microbiology Department of Odontology Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Copenhagen Copenhagen Denmark 2Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering Nanyang Technological University Singapore Singapore Singapore and 3Costerton Biofilm Center Department of Immunology and Microbiology Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Copenhagen Copenhagen DenmarkCorrespondence Daniel Belstrom Daniel Belstrom and Florentin Constancias contributed equally to this work.Received 20 February 2017 Revised 3 August 2017 Accepted 1 September 2017Metagenomictranscriptomic analysis of salivaD Belstrom et al.2The aims of the present study were to employ metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses to i characterize the diversity and community composition of the salivary microbiota ii to utilize these data to determine the microbial activity DNARNA ratio of each taxon identified and iii to identify differentially expressed microbial genes.

Streptococcus was significantly more abundant based on metatranscriptomic identification 50 than metagenomic identification 25 p  0.05.The predominant 20 bacterial species based on metagenomic and metatranscriptomic bacterial identifications are displayed in Fig.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to perform comprehensive simultaneous metagenomic and metatranscriptomic characteriza- tion of the salivary microbiota.Streptococcus was identified as the most predominant bacterial genus by use of both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses Figs.

a. Interestingly this observation aligns with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data extracted from a batch of supragingival samples in which major differences in bacterial metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles were observed.Thus this observa- tion suggests that some bacterial genera including Streptococcus may constitute the more active part of the salivary microbiota while other members of the salivary microbiota for example Rothia sp.

These specific and well-known disease-asso- ciated bacterial species were identified in higher relative abundance in saliva samples from patients with periodontitis and dental caries.
