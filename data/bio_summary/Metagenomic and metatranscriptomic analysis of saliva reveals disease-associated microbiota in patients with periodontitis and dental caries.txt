such alterations may in turn change the relation between the host and the resident microbiota from symbiosis to dysbiosis thereby fueling initiation and progression of periodontitis and dental caries.saliva is the biological fluid of the oral cavity which is critical for maintenance of oral and general health.therefore saliva has been intensively investigated for candidate biomarkers associated with oral health and disease.saliva is sterile when entering the oral cavity but when sampled saliva contains a diverse microbiota.in healthy oral conditions the composition of the salivary microbiota is different from that of supragingival and subgingival biofilms.on the other hand the presence of specific bacterial species in saliva such as porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans has been reported in individuals with periodontitis and dental caries respectively.essentially these findings suggest that bacteria from local periodontitis and caries lesions may be spilled-over and dispersed into saliva.

these specific and well-known disease-asso- ciated bacterial species were identified in higher relative abundance in saliva samples from patients with periodontitis and dental caries.

the primary finding was that both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses identified higher salivary abundance of specific oral bacterial species in periodontitis and dental caries patients.

notably 16s-metabarcoding analysis of the same samples showedsignificantly lower relative abundance of streptococcus species in samples from periodontitis patients compared to healthy con- trolswhich suggests that metatranscriptomic profiles observed in this study probably associates with differential functional activity of salivary streptococcus species in oral health and disease.

were identified with significantly higher relative abundance in samples from periodontitis and dental caries patients respectively based on both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches figs.

50 of all rna reads could be taxonomically assigned to streptococcus species it is likely that a substantial part of salivary metabolic activity derived from streptococcus species which is further supported by the fact that streptococcus species are proficient in carbohydrate metabolism.

the main hypothesis was that the taxonomic composition as well as microbial activity could be an indicator of the oral health status and possible differences might potentially be used as proxy biomarkers of oral health and disease.resultsgeneral informationfrom a total of 30 saliva samples 768.62 m mean 25.62 m range14.61 m-32.64 m dna sequences and 981.48 m mean 32.72 m range 26.40 m-38.44 m rna sequences were generated out of which 274.17 m dna mean 9.14 m range 2.58 m-18.52 m and148.49 rna mean 4.50 m range 2.93 m-9.11 m passed quality control supporting material table s1.at species level a significantly higher a-diversity observed species was recorded by metagenomics compared to metatran- scriptomic analysis figs.
