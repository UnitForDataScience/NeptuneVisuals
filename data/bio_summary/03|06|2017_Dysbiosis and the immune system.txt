Inflammatory conditions strongly cor- related with an overall decrease in microbiota species richness and an alteration in the abundance of several taxa with mucosal samples correlating better with dis- ease severity than did luminal faecal samples while anti- biotic use exacerbated microbial dysbiosis associated with disease.This demonstrates the potential of shotgun meta- genomic sequencing and non-targeted metabolom- ics to characterize microbial community function in IBD which may enable the identification of microbial biomarkers127.

The microbiota of wild-type mice varies considerably between vivaria and between commercial vendors23147 thus dimin- ishing the universality of local compositional comparisons of the microbial taxa present in different mice.Second as host-microbiome co-evolution probably selected for microbial function rather than microbial composition5 the concept of dysbiosis likewise deserves a functional rather than a taxonomic interpretation.

Despite the reported differences in microbial composition the role of TLR signalling in the control of intestinal micro- bial ecology remains unresolved as follow-up studies have suggested that maternal transmission rather than genetic deficiency might explain the microbial differences observed in TLR-deficient mice59.Additional PRRs with a suggested link to micro- bial dysbiosis are the NOD-like receptors NLRs.

A more individualized approach that links microbial community structure anddisease phenotype might therefore prove more effective with regard to diagnosing early disease progression on the basis of microbial biomarkers.

In addition levels of the microbial metabolite4-ethylphenylsulfate were increased in the serum of offspring that displayed autism-like behaviour and induced behavioural symptoms in control mice suggesting a role for microbial metabolites in autism19.

Although several of these new associations have brought about promising implications for future diagnos- tic and therapeutic approaches various challenges need to be overcome by the field to harness the new wealth of information on different states of the microbial ecosystem and their role in disease development.NATURE REVIEWS  IMMUNOLOGYVOLUME 17  APRIL 2017  229REVIEWS First given the wide range of composition that the intestinal microbiota can assume in the absence of overt disease the importance of appropriate controls for defin- ing a microbial ecosystem as dysbiotic is imminent10.

Relative to microbial composition microbial function- alities and metabolite profiles associated with a particular condition or genotype might be not only more consistent across populations geography and animal facilities23 but also of much higher causative relevance for the associated disease manifestation.

In recent years many of the modern multifactorial diseases that show an increas- ing incidence have been associated with an abnormal microbiome structure termed dysbiosis which affects the taxonomical composition as well as the metagenomic function of the microbial community.

In this Review we focus primarily on the bacterial part of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and its effects on immune homeostasis and the risk of immune-mediated and immune-associated diseases.The healthy intestinal microbial community can be characterized in terms of diversity stability and resist- ance and resilience4 which are defined respectively as the richness of the ecosystem its amenability to perturb- ation and its ability to return to the pre-perturbation state.

Data from large human cohort studies suggest that multiple stable states of the microbial ecosystem can col- onize a host in the absence of overt signs of disease5-7 FIG.
