Typically the initial colonizers of the gut are facultative anaerobes and within days or weeks there is a shift from facultative to obligate anaerobes  The establishment of the microbiota is influenced by multiple factors including gestational age delivery mode birth weight diet and exposure to antibiotics - For example the microbiota of infants born vaginally resembles the mother's vaginal and fecal microbiota whereas the microbiota of infants born by cesarean section is more similar to the microbiota of skin or other environments  It has also been sug- gested that C-section-delivered infants have lower diversity gut microbial communities compared to vagi- nally delivered infants The infant gut undergoes a rapid increase in the abundance and diversity of micro- bial communities during the first few weeks After 2-3 years of life the gut microbiota become more stable and adult-like  Large variations have been observed among different individuals and also over time within the same individual .

In premature infants high level of fecal acetate has been associated with in- creased Bifidobacteria ConclusionsIn this study we conducted a metagenome-informed metaproteomic analysis of 30 gut communities from four human preterm infants allowing us to characterize species-specific gut microbial functional variations be- tween infants during the critical first few weeks of life.

Dys- biosis of the gut microbiota has been linked to many diseases such as Crohn's disease - diabetes  and autoimmune diseases The establishment of gut microbiota begins during infancy and emerging evi- dence suggests that this initial colonization has lifelong effects on human health A rapidly increasing number of studies have focused on understanding the establishment of the microbiota at birth or microbiota associations with infant health and disease.Although originally thought to be born sterile the presence of microbes in placental and meconium sam- ples has suggested that infants may be colonized by small populations of microbes prior to birth Re- gardless newborn infants are exposed to large num- bers of bacteria from the mother and the environment at birth.

This is particularly critical forpremature infants who may have a delayed and aber- rant microbiota.Infants born prematurely are at higher morbidity and mortality risk due to immature organ systems that are not properly adapted to extrauterine life These infants are susceptible to inflammatory disorders as a result of their poorly developed immune system and prenatalpostnatal events that inappropriately modulate immunity e.g.

Results showed that gut colonization was largely unique among infants and that no single bacterial strain was shared among all infants who developed NEC This suggests that the disease is not caused by a single bacterial strain but rather may be associated with multiple deleterious bacteria that disrupt essential activities of mutualistic microbes.

Microbial composition was largely different between infants and Enterococcus faecalis was the only species that was shared by all infants.

The four infants in this study represent four of the first infants within the overall co- hort to undergo metagenomics sequencing that also had remaining fecal samples with enough biomass to permit proteomic analysis.

Metaproteomics is an emerging technology for the large-scale characterization of metabolic functions in complex microbialcommunities gut microbiota.Results We applied a metagenome-informed metaproteomic approach to study the temporal and inter-individual differences of metabolic functions during microbial colonization of preterm human infants' gut.

By analyzing 30 individual fecal samples we identified up to 12568 protein groups for each of four infants including both human and microbial proteins.

perinatal infection and inflammation Among premature infants the incidence of sep- sis and necrotizing enterocolitis NEC have remained high and have been associated with aberrant gut micro- bial colonization during first few weeks of life The role of bacterial colonization in neonatal NEC has been suggested by a number of observations including the identification of pneumatosis intestinalis gas in the bowel wall which is most likely produced by intestinal bacteria occurrence of outbreaks in hospital and reso- lution of inflammation after treatment with antibiotics -Recently Raveh-Sadka et al.
