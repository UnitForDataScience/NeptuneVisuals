hepaticus negative SH- top left a mouse that was Smad3-- and H. hepaticus negative S-H- top right a mouse that was Smad3 and H. hepaticus positive SH bottom left and a mouse that was Smad3-- and H. hepaticus positive S-H bottom right three panels from one histological section.

Even though both SMAD3 deficiency and H. hepaticus inoculation are required for colon cancer in this model the OXPHOS pathway is changed more by H. hepaticus than by SMAD3 deficiency.It is important to note that Lactobacillus plantarum does not appear to be involved in altering butyrate polyamine LPS or OXPHOS levels yet it is undetectable in the mice with H. hepaticus  see also .

hepaticus positive H. hepaticus only SH and iv Smad3--H. hepaticus positive combined S-H. summarizes each comparison group where cecal samples from 10 mice were pooled per group 11 malefemale ratio.

Results are split into two sections first pathways that are changed by the Smad3-- and combined but not H. hepaticus effects and second pathways that are changed by the H. hepaticus and combined but not Smad3-- effects.Smad3-- and combined effects on bacterial pathways.
