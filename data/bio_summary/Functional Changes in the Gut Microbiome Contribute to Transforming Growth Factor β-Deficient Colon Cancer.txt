hepaticus negative SH- top left a mouse that was Smad3-- and H. hepaticus negative S-H- top right a mouse that was Smad3 and H. hepaticus positive SH bottom left and a mouse that was Smad3-- and H. hepaticus positive S-H bottom right three panels from one histological section.

Even though both SMAD3 deficiency and H. hepaticus inoculation are required for colon cancer in this model the OXPHOS pathway is changed more by H. hepaticus than by SMAD3 deficiency.It is important to note that Lactobacillus plantarum does not appear to be involved in altering butyrate polyamine LPS or OXPHOS levels yet it is undetectable in the mice with H. hepaticus  see also .

hepaticus positive H. hepaticus only SH and iv Smad3--H. hepaticus positive combined S-H. summarizes each comparison group where cecal samples from 10 mice were pooled per group 11 malefemale ratio.

Results are split into two sections first pathways that are changed by the Smad3-- and combined but not H. hepaticus effects and second pathways that are changed by the H. hepaticus and combined but not Smad3-- effects.Smad3-- and combined effects on bacterial pathways.

Finally H. hepaticus itself has increased RNA counts of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation OXPHOS.

Additionally we focus on significant changes to RNA counts in genes by sample type using the following comparisons S-H- versus SH- SH versus SH- and S-H versus SH- here referred to as Smad3-- effect H. hepaticus effect and combined effect respectively.

Changes in fractions of total bacterial counts at different taxonomic levels for the SH- Control S-H- Smad3-- SH H. hepaticus only and S-H Combined groups.

Similarly to buk these genes have different RNA counts in the Smad3-- and combined effects but little difference in the H. hepaticus effect.For aguB in the combined group S-H the species Marinomonas mediterranea MMB-1 Desulfotomaculum ruminis DSM 2154 and Bacteroides uniformis dnLKV2 are responsible for the majority of the expression.

As already discussed there are strong correla- tions between the presence of inflammatory conditions and the progression of colo- rectal cancer thus we examined LPS gene signatures in our data set.Several LPS genes have increased RNA counts in the H. hepaticus and combined effects 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic-acid transferase kdtA UDP-3-O-3-hydroxymyristoyl N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase lpxD and UDP-3-O-3-hydroxymyristoyl gluco- samine N-acyltransferase lpxC.

Intriguingly it is not H. hepaticus itself that is responsible for the increased RNA counts it is M. schaedleri.
