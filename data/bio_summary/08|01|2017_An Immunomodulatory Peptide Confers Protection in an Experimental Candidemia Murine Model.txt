we also performed xtt 23-bis-2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl- 2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assays to assess the biofilm-inhibitory effect of idr- 1018 which revealed that peptide concentrations 4 ug ml-1 promoted viability loss of 40 on 2-day-old biofilms formed by both c. albicans strains .table 1 mics mfcs and mbics of idr-1018 against the c. albicans strains in this studyaathe mics after the 24- or 48-h experiment endpoints were 32 and 64 ug ml-1 for c. albicans atcc 10231 and the clinical isolate ci respectively.

a total of 10 animals were utilized for each of the 6 experimental groups i mock infected with pbs and pbs treated ii infected with c. albicans and pbs treated iii infected with c. albicans and treated with amphotericin b 0.5 mg  kg-1 and iv to vi infected with c. albicans and treated with 1 5 and 10 mg  kg-1 idr-1018 respectively.

the mics of idr-1018 against c. albicans planktonic cells were 32 and 64 ug ml-1 for the c. albicans atcc 10231 and clinical isolate ci strains respectively in experiments with both 24- and 48-h end- points .

albicans cells that originated from mature biofilms treated with 16 ug ml-1 of peptide presented a lower growth rate than planktonic cells not biofilm derived and treated with the same concentration of idr-1018 which does not exert fungicidal or fungistatic action.

all experiments for mic assays were performed using a starting inoculum of 2.5 x 103 yeast cells per well as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute guideline m27-a3 .the immunomodulatory profile of idr-1018 over macrophage cells was created using heat-killed c. albicans hkca as an infectious stimulus.

biofilm cells were stained using the livedead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular probes eugene or containing syto-9 green fluorescence live cells and propidium iodide pi red fluorescence dead cells at a ratio of 15 volvol.

a c. albicans atcc 10231 and b c. albicans clinical isolate ci untreated biofilms and biofilms treated with ampho- tericin b 16 ug ml-1 fluconazole 64 ug ml-1 and idr-1018 2 to 256 ug ml-1.

although those same peptide concentrations 32 to 64 ug ml-1 prevented c. albicans biofilm formation idr-1018 at a concentration 8-fold lower than its planktonic mic inhibited biofilmfig 3 influence of idr-1018 on cytokine production by bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated or not with heat-killed c. albicans hkca.

candida albicans strain atcc 10231 and a clinical isolate ci from laboratorio central de saude do distrito federal lacen a brazilian reference laboratory for clinical isolates in brasilia brazil obtained from a blood culture of an immunocompromised patient infected with c. albicans were used in this study.

2016. dissecting candida albicans infection from the perspective of c. albicans virulence and omics ap- proaches on host-pathogen interaction a review.

peptide idr-1018 at concentrations of 32 and 64 ug ml-1 was able to cause both death of c. albicans planktonic cells minimal fungicidal concentration mfc and a reduction in crystal violet-stained biofilm adhesion to the plastic sides of microtiter plates.

to investigate the potential of idr-1018 to act on mature biofilms we used confocal microscopy with flow cells which do not suffer from the same issues as the plastic adherent biofilm assay method for c. albicans ci.

albicans ci cells.

the mbics for preformed biofilms of both c. albicans strains were 8-fold lower than their respective mics 4 and 8 ug ml-1 respectively and were determined using flow cells coupled with confocal microscopy.hemolytic and cellular viability assay with idr-1018 treatment.

the cellular viability of all cells under the tested conditions was 99 which permitted an evaluation of idr-1018's effects on the cytokine profile of bmdms stimulated with heat-killed c. albicans hkca with or without gamma interferon ifn--y. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas were performed for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf-a interleukin-113 il-113 il-6 il-12 and il-10 .
