We also performed XTT 23-bis-2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl- 2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assays to assess the biofilm-inhibitory effect of IDR- 1018 which revealed that peptide concentrations 4 ug ml-1 promoted viability loss of 40 on 2-day-old biofilms formed by both C. albicans strains .TABLE 1 MICs MFCs and MBICs of IDR-1018 against the C. albicans strains in this studyaaThe MICs after the 24- or 48-h experiment endpoints were 32 and 64 ug ml-1 for C. albicans ATCC 10231 and the clinical isolate CI respectively.

A total of 10 animals were utilized for each of the 6 experimental groups i mock infected with PBS and PBS treated ii infected with C. albicans and PBS treated iii infected with C. albicans and treated with amphotericin B 0.5 mg  kg-1 and iv to vi infected with C. albicans and treated with 1 5 and 10 mg  kg-1 IDR-1018 respectively.

The MICs of IDR-1018 against C. albicans planktonic cells were 32 and 64 ug ml-1 for the C. albicans ATCC 10231 and clinical isolate CI strains respectively in experiments with both 24- and 48-h end- points .

albicans cells that originated from mature biofilms treated with 16 ug ml-1 of peptide presented a lower growth rate than planktonic cells not biofilm derived and treated with the same concentration of IDR-1018 which does not exert fungicidal or fungistatic action.

All experiments for MIC assays were performed using a starting inoculum of 2.5 X 103 yeast cells per well as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline M27-A3 .The immunomodulatory profile of IDR-1018 over macrophage cells was created using heat-killed C. albicans HKCA as an infectious stimulus.

Biofilm cells were stained using the LIVEDEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit Molecular Probes Eugene OR containing SYTO-9 green fluorescence live cells and propidium iodide PI red fluorescence dead cells at a ratio of 15 volvol.

A C. albicans ATCC 10231 and B C. albicans clinical isolate CI untreated biofilms and biofilms treated with ampho- tericin B 16 ug ml-1 fluconazole 64 ug ml-1 and IDR-1018 2 to 256 ug ml-1.

Although those same peptide concentrations 32 to 64 ug ml-1 prevented C. albicans biofilm formation IDR-1018 at a concentration 8-fold lower than its planktonic MIC inhibited biofilmFIG 3 Influence of IDR-1018 on cytokine production by bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated or not with heat-killed C. albicans HKCA.

Candida albicans strain ATCC 10231 and a clinical isolate CI from Laboratorio Central de Saude do Distrito Federal LACEN a Brazilian reference laboratory for clinical isolates in Brasilia Brazil obtained from a blood culture of an immunocompromised patient infected with C. albicans were used in this study.
