The mean concentration of N-acetyltryptophan was 10-fold higher in urine of piperacillin-tazobactam-treated mice than in urine of saline controls or aztreonam-treated mice on day 3 after antibiotic treatment 7 of 8 piperacillin- tazobactam-treated mice had increased levels of N-acetyltryptophan in comparison to the pretreatment levels.

The antibiotic dose was equal to the usual human doses administered over a 24-h period milligrams of antibiotic per gram of body weight.To assess in vivo colonization resistance subgroups of the antibiotic-treated mice were challenged with 104 CFU of C. difficile VA17 spores by orogastric gavage either before or 3 6 or 11 days after the completion of antibiotic treatment 8 mice from each treatment group were challenged at each time point.

For the group of mice challenged with C. difficile on day 11 8 mice fresh urine specimens were collected in sterile Eppendorf tubes before antibiotic treatment and on days 3 6 and 11 after antibiotic treatment.

Compounds were assessed as possible biomarkers of colonization resistance if there was a significant difference in concentrations between the piperacillin-tazobactam-treated and control mice on day 3 after piperacillin-tazobactam treatment but not at baseline or day 11 this choice was based on the finding that colonization resistance was disrupted on day 3 after piperacillin-tazobactam treatment but not at baseline or on day 11 after treatment.

Piperacillin-tazobactam-treated mice had altered colonization resistance when chal- lenged with C. difficile 3 days after the final antibiotic dose with high-density coloni- zation in comparison to the controls and aztreonam-treated mice P  0.001 6 days after the final antibiotic dose there was a nonsignificant trend toward an increased density of colonization in the piperacillin-tazobactam-treated versus control and aztreonam-treated mice P 0.07.

Our finding of increased N-acetyltryptophan and decreased indole-3-propionic acid concentrations in urine of piperacillin-tazobactam-treated mice is consistent with previously reported data for stool of antibiotic-treated mice and for serum of germfree mice   .

The concentrations of cinnamoylglycine and enterodiol were 100- fold lower in urine of all of the piperacillin-tazobactam-treated mice than in urine of the saline controls or aztreonam-treated mice on day 3 after antibiotic treatment.DISCUSSIONOur findings are consistent with data from previous studies in demonstrating that piperacillin-tazobactam treatment causes a disruption of colonization resistance whereas aztreonam an agent lacking activity against anaerobes does not .

We demonstrated previously that clindamycin or piperacillin- tazobactam treatment of mice resulted in the disruption of colonization resistanceAugust 2017 Volume 61 Issue 8 e00477-17Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1FIG 1 Effect of antibiotic treatment on in vivo colonization resistance to Clostridium difficile.

Mice received subcutaneous antibiotic treatment for 2 days and subgroups 8 per group were challenged with 10000 CFU of C. difficile spores before treatment or on days 3 6 and 11 after antibiotic treatment by gastric gavage.

By correlating the timing of the functional recovery of colonization resistance with changes in concentrations of se- lected urine metabolites we identified 3 potential urinary biomarkers of colonization resistance N-acetyltryptophan cinnamoylglycine and enterodiol.The biomarkers identified are biologically plausible and our findings for these compounds are consistent with data from previous studies with germfree mice and antibiotic-treated mice or humans   .
