The microorganisms from the oral cavity of the offending snake get an optimal environmental growth condition at the puncture site which may results in an infection if neglected may leads to the serious cause of amputation and permanent disabilities in snakebite victim .However information about the oral microbiota of snakes is limited as very few studies and limited data are available on snakebite infections.

Twenty-three Mor- ganella morganii isolates were obtained from IC five each from RV and KV which are higher than any other microorganism isolated and it was not observed in EV.Table 3 Antibiotic susceptibility of oral cavity isolates of snakesThe values indicated in the bracket are percent susceptibilities of isolatesCEP Cephalothin CD Clindamycin COT Cotrimoxazole E Erythromycin GEN Gentamicin OF Ofloxacin P Penicillin VA Vancomycin AMP Ampicillin C Chloramphenicol OX OxacillinLZ Linezolid AZM Azithromycin AK Amikacin CLR Clarithromycin TEL Teicoplanin MET Methicillin AMC Amoxyclav NV Novobiocin TE TetracyclineTable 4 Antibiotic susceptibility of oral cavity isolates of snakesThe values indicated in the bracket are percent susceptibilities of isolatesIPM Imipenem CIP Ciprofloxacin TOB Tobramycin MO Moxifloxacin OF Ofloxacin SPX Sparfloxacin LE Levofloxacin NX Norfloxacin COT Cotrimoxazole CL Colistin NA Nalidixic acid AMC Augmentin K Kanamycin GAT Gatifloxacin GEN Gentamicin AK Amikacin S Streptomycin CTR Ceftriaxone CPD Cefpodoxime TI TicarcillinAssessment of Cultivable Oral Bacterial Flora from Important Venomous Snakes...1285The other pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for causing soft tissue infection ecthyma gangrenosum folliculitis dermatitis urinary tract infec- tion osteomyelitis and nosocomial infection in immune- suppressed snakebite victims.Aeromonas hydrophila is one of the potentially impor- tant pathogen which causes hemorrhagic septicemia some strains are responsible to produce aerolysin endowed with hemolytic cytolytic activity and diarrheal illness.

Several studies demonstrate the diversity of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic microorgan- isms in the oral flora of southern African snakes Chinese cobra and Bamboo pit viper as well as the involvement of these secondary infectious agents after the snakebite      .Specific antivenom is the only remedy for snakebite envenomation treatment but equal importance has to be given to the secondary wound infections arising from pathogens of the oral cavity of snakes which can be avoided with the use of a definite course of antibiotics   .

India records the worst number of snakebite incidences which devotes considerable impor- tance towards snakebite envenomation and injurious com- plications resulting after the snakebite  .

The pathogens from the oral cavity of the snake tend to initiate an infection resulting in gas gangrene soft tissue necrosis and permanent physical disabilities.

The study can conclude that the oral cavity of the snakes has a diversity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics.

The microbial flora of the oral cavity of snakesAssessment of Cultivable Oral Bacterial Flora from Important Venomous Snakes...1279varies greatly as the snake habitat is in close proximity to the rhizosphere and also the prey contributes in the diversity of snake mouth microflora  .

The oral cavity swabs were taken instantly after capturing of snakes before the administration of any food drugs or antibiotics.

The snakes of each group were labeled as IC C1-C5 RV R1- R5 KV K1-K5 and EV E1-E5.Swabbing MethodThe captured snakes were restrained manually and immo- bilized to set up the satisfactory swabbing from the oral cavity of snakes with the help of the sterile mouth gag.

The antibiotic susceptibility test of aerobic iso- lates was performed at 35 - 2 degC for 24-48 h in an incubator whereas anaerobic isolates were tested at 35 - 2 degC in an anaerobic incubator for 24-48 h.Assessment of Cultivable Oral Bacterial Flora from Important Venomous Snakes...1281ResultsAll swab samples collected from the oral cavity of snakes have showed microbial growth in the enrichment medium after incubation.
