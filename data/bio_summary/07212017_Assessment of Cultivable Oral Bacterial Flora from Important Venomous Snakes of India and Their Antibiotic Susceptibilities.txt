however some authors reported the presence of citrobacter species providencia species yersinia species bordetella species chryseobacterium species shewanella species steno- trophomonas species diphtheria species lactococcus species rhodococcus species vagococcus species some cetobacterium species and anaerobic bacilli in the oral cavity of snakes       .antibiotic susceptibility testingthe use of antibiotics in snakebite treatment is controver- sial.

several studies have explored the microorganism harbored in the oral cavity of snakes including enterobacteriaceae family species aeromonas hydrophila pseudomonas aerugi- nosa staphylococcus aureus streptococcus species micrococcus species bacillus species and anaerobes like clostridium perfringens and bacteroides species      .

a wide range of microorganisms have been reported in snakebite-related infection which includes staphylococcus aureus proteus vulgaris shigella species pseudomonas aeruginosa morganella morganii aeromonas hydrophilaenterococcus species serratia marcescens proteus mir- abilis shewanella putrefaciens enterobacter aerogenes salmonella typhi citrobacter freundii klebsiella pneu- moniae bacillus subtilis bacillus megaterium and bacillus cereus and anaerobes include clostridium per- fringens streptococcus species and bacteroides species         .in snakebite studies a negligence occurs in the associ- ation of microbial infections caused by snakebites due to increased attention given to cases of envenomation   .

a total 205 strains were isolated from the oropharyngeal cavity of snakes which represent the common pathogens especially morganella morganii escherichia coli aeromonashydrophila pseudomonas aeruginosa coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus bacillus species micrococcus species and some anaerobes including clostridium per- fringens.

the oral cavity flora of snakes is mostly dominated by enterobacteriaceae 41.80 and each snake oral flora having distinct patterns varies from species to species.

twenty-three mor- ganella morganii isolates were obtained from ic five each from rv and kv which are higher than any other microorganism isolated and it was not observed in ev.table 3 antibiotic susceptibility of oral cavity isolates of snakesthe values indicated in the bracket are percent susceptibilities of isolatescep cephalothin cd clindamycin cot cotrimoxazole e erythromycin gen gentamicin of ofloxacin p penicillin va vancomycin amp ampicillin c chloramphenicol ox oxacillinlz linezolid azm azithromycin ak amikacin clr clarithromycin tel teicoplanin met methicillin amc amoxyclav nv novobiocin te tetracyclinetable 4 antibiotic susceptibility of oral cavity isolates of snakesthe values indicated in the bracket are percent susceptibilities of isolatesipm imipenem cip ciprofloxacin tob tobramycin mo moxifloxacin of ofloxacin spx sparfloxacin le levofloxacin nx norfloxacin cot cotrimoxazole cl colistin na nalidixic acid amc augmentin k kanamycin gat gatifloxacin gen gentamicin ak amikacin s streptomycin ctr ceftriaxone cpd cefpodoxime ti ticarcillinassessment of cultivable oral bacterial flora from important venomous snakes...1285the other pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for causing soft tissue infection ecthyma gangrenosum folliculitis dermatitis urinary tract infec- tion osteomyelitis and nosocomial infection in immune- suppressed snakebite victims.aeromonas hydrophila is one of the potentially impor- tant pathogen which causes hemorrhagic septicemia some strains are responsible to produce aerolysin endowed with hemolytic cytolytic activity and diarrheal illness.

the microorganisms from the oral cavity of the offending snake get an optimal environmental growth condition at the puncture site which may results in an infection if neglected may leads to the serious cause of amputation and permanent disabilities in snakebite victim .however information about the oral microbiota of snakes is limited as very few studies and limited data are available on snakebite infections.

several studies demonstrate the diversity of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic microorgan- isms in the oral flora of southern african snakes chinese cobra and bamboo pit viper as well as the involvement of these secondary infectious agents after the snakebite      .specific antivenom is the only remedy for snakebite envenomation treatment but equal importance has to be given to the secondary wound infections arising from pathogens of the oral cavity of snakes which can be avoided with the use of a definite course of antibiotics   .

india records the worst number of snakebite incidences which devotes considerable impor- tance towards snakebite envenomation and injurious com- plications resulting after the snakebite  .

the researchers reported the involvement of staphylococcus aureus micrococcus species and streptococcus species in the development of an abscess cellulitis and other deep tissue infection .

among the enterobacteriaceae family species escherichia coli salmonella species and proteus vulgaris are responsible for various infections including gastroenteritis septicemia respiratory tract infection meningitis diarrhea fever and soft tissue infection.

snakebite is a major cause of the human morbidity and mortality since ancient times as it not only affects the victim by systemic envenomation but also by wound infections originating from deadly pathogenic microorganisms from the oral cavity of the offending snake.

to reduce the risk of anatomical complication and severity of secondary wound infection resulting from snakebite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is preferred.the bacterial flora of the oral cavity of snakes was highly diverse in nature and changes according to the geographical variation snake health and type of prey ingested    .

twelve isolates of clostridium per- fringens were derived from the oral cavity of snakes which implicates the possible role of this organism in the for- mation of gas gangrene in snakebite victims.
