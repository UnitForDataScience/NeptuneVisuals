Are we any closer to screening for colorectal cancer using microbial markersA critical reviewLubomir Starya Kristyna Mezerovab Pavel Skalickya Pavel Zborila Vladislav RaclavskybcThe role of gut microbiota in the development of sporadic colorectal cancer CRC is supported by a number of studies however the conclusiveness of published metagenomic studies is questioned by technical pitfalls and limited by small cohort sizes.

Last but not least we summarise available knowledge useful for improving care for patients immediately.Key words colorectal cancer microbiome culturomics screening markersReceived June 15 2017 Accepted November 15 2017 Available online December 13 2017 httpsdoi.org10.5507bp.2017.051aDepartment of Surgery I University Hospital Olomouc Czech RepublicbDepartment of Microbiology Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry Palacky University Olomouc Czech Republic cInstitute of Molecular and Translational Medicine Palacky University Olomouc Czech Republic Corresponding author Vladislav Raclavsky e-mail INTRODUCTIONSporadic colorectal cancer CRC represents 80-85 of all CRC cases.

It should however be stressed that trustworthy conclusions useful for population-wide screening can be reached only when validation studies are verified indepen- dently on the same well defined population representing a challenging but meaningful task for public health au- thorities and funding agencies.Search strategy and selection criteriaData for this article were identified by searches of PubMed using the terms colorectal cancer gut micro- biome culturomics screening and combinations of these terms and by following references from relevant articles.
