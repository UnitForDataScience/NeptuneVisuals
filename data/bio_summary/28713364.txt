brown particles were considered as positive cells.the percentage of foxp3- and il-10-positive cells in rats in the model group was significantly lower than the normal p  0.05 while the percentage of tnf-a and nf-kb p65 was significantly higher p  0.05. after treatment with hep the percentages of foxp3- and il-10-positive cells significantly increased compared with the model group and the percentages of tnf-a- and nf-kb p65-positive cells significantly reduced compared with the model group p  0.05. after treatment with 100 mgkg  day of hep all the cytokine levels were restored to near normal some anti- inflammatory cytokines 1l-1a  1l-2 figure 5  influence of cyclophosphamide on the cecal microbiota of mice.

the immunosuppressant mice were induced by intra-peritoneally injecting cyclophosphamide cyclophosphamide- induced group ctx 80 mgkg once a day for 3 days while the mice in the normal group were intraperitoneally injected with saline as a control.

the rats in the hep-treated group showed a significant improvement compared with the tnbs-treated group.
