Normal group model group induced by TNBS enema HEP group the crude protein extract-treated group after TNBS enema and positive control group treated with 100 mgkg  day of 5-aminosalicylic acid after TNBS enema.

Then 24 moderately sizedFigUre 4  Continuedmice were chosen and divided into three groups including HEP3 high-dose group HH 100 mgkg  day HEP3 low- dose group HL 50 mgkg  day and model group with eight mice in each group and another eight normal mice as the normal group.

Control is the normal group without any treatments Model is the TNBS-induced IBD rats HEP is the crude proteinextract-treated group after TNBS enema and 5-aminosalicylic acid 5-ASA is the positive control group treated with 100 mgkg  day of 5-ASA after TNBS enema.

All the results revealed that HEP3 a 52-kDa protein extracted fromerinaceus was a FIP.heP3 reversed d-galactose-induced hiepic senescent cell ProliferationAs shown in  the number of blue-stained cells of the model group induced by 40 mgmL of d-galactose for 72 h  a the d-galactose-induced senescent cells are not shown was obviously higher than that of the normal group P  0.05 HEP3 could reduce the number of senescent cellsespecially in the high-dose group and promote cell prolifera-tion  b-e.

The model group wasreduced to 2884.07 2974.49 094 and 6.81 the different were significant by compared to the normal P  0.05 while these parameters were recovered to 3303.52 3387.48 0.96 7.13 forthe low-dose HEP3-treated group P  0.05 and the high-dose group 3415.14 3540.04 0.96 7.33 respectively were better P  0.01.

P  0.05 vs the control group P  0.05 P  0.01 vs the model group indicating significant differences compared with the model group.FigUre 2  Effects of HEP on trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution TNBS-induced rats.

The immunosuppressant mice were induced by intra-peritoneally injecting cyclophosphamide cyclophosphamide- induced group CTX 80 mgkg once a day for 3 days while the mice in the normal group were intraperitoneally injected with saline as a control.

The rats in the HEP-treated group showed a significant improvement compared with the TNBS-treated group.

After treatment with HEP the percentages of Foxp3- and IL-10-positive cells significantly increased compared with the model group and the percentages of TNF-a- and NF-kB p65-positive cells significantly reduced compared with the model group P  0.05.

Z denotes the control normal group just treated with vehicle and M is the cyclophosphamide-induced intraperitoneal injection of 80 mgkg group.1L-8  1L-10  1L-11  IL-12 TNF-g  TNF-a  VEGF  MIP-a  M-CSF  and MPO activity  were secreted significantly and better com- pared with the positive control group P  0.05 as shown in .
