Although expression of SLC13A5 in inflammatory cells such as monocytes has not been reported it has been reported that exogenous citrate modu- lates liposaccharide-induced monocyte inflammatory responses in cell culture  raising the question of the role of exogenous citrate in inflammation.We recently addressed this issue by supplementing citrate in the drinking water of mice fed a standard diet .

Moreover mito- chondrial citrate carrier and ACLY expression is upregulated byLPS in a NF-kB-dependent fashion increasing citrate influx to the cytosol .Furthermore citrate may also have epigenetic effects on mac- rophages.

Further studies are needed to address the metabolic effects of citrate supplementation in the long-term as well as in association with high-calorie diets.SAlT A view BeYOND HYPeRTeNSiONSalt especially in the form of sodium chloride is largely used worldwide to increase food flavor and palatability.

Despite the well-described fate of endogenous citrate the fate of ingested citrate remains largely unexplored.

Potentiation of LPS effects by citrate could be blocked by TCA an ACLY competitive inhibitor suggesting the participation of cytosolic citrate metabolism in this effect.

Furthermore citrate car- rier acetylation and inhibition strongly decreases LPS-induced inflammatory response .Finally the contribution of citrate to obesity and its related comorbidities can be inferred indirectly by pharmacological data.

A few of these additives even have well-known beneficial health effects as exemplified by probiotics and prebiotics.

A phase-II clinical trial showed that bempedoic acid safely low- ers LDL-c levels and could be used alone or in association with others therapies .
