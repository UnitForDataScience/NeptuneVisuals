They identified 4domains of innovation that could derive from ongoing efforts in deciphering the interactions between human cells and intestinal microbiome as a central component of human health namelydevelopment of stratification and monitoring toolsidentification of new target and drug discovery as a part of our supra-genomeexploita- tion of microbiota as a therapeutic target that can be modulatedand finally as a source of live biotherapeutics and adjuvants.The Experts in nutrition and clinical die- tetics could actively contribute to several of these areas particularly 3 and 4 and I encourage greater cross-disci- plinary collaboration to achieve the full potential of diet to modify the intestinal microbiome to improve human health.Disclosure of potential conflicts of interestThe author reports no conflicts of interest.ORCIDSharon M.

The authors proposed that to more fully understand the ontogeny of the infant microbiota a collaborative study that obtains stool samples from a large cohort of infants located in various sites around the globe in which detailed records of dietary intake and other environmental factors are collected is needed to provide a more complete understanding of the development of the microbiota in infants who are breast- vs. formula-fed.Older ageThe next paper in the supplement from the laboratory of Clara de los Reyes-Gavil'an focuses on the other end of the age spectrum by reviewing how changes in physiologic function dietary intake and nutritional status affect the microbiome in aged populations.

In her review Hannah Holscher summarizes the current evidence linking dietary fiber and prebiotic consumption to human gastrointestinal microbiota composition and function including the effects of physiochemical properties of the complex carbohydrates adequate intake and treatment dosages and the phenotypic composition of the human micro- biota.In addition to human trials animal in vitro and computational research are all needed to advance our understanding of the physiologic effects of dietary fibers and prebiotics in both healthy and disease states and to delineate mechanisms of action.Future opportunities for nutritional modulation of the gut microbiome to improve human healthThe gut microbiome also referred to as our second genome integrates external signals to exert nutri- tional metabolic and immunomodulatory functions that are relevant to health and well-being of the host.There are immense opportunities to use per- sonalized nutritional interventions to prevent andor treat acute and chronic diseases including gastrointes- tinaland fatty liver diseasesobesitycardiovas- cular disease and even neuropsychiatric disorders.

Schematic representation of articles in the special focus issue relative to life stage and nutrition.infants and how it can be manipulated through diet is clinically important since current evidence suggest that the microbiota acquired in early life can program gas- trointestinal immune and neural development.23-26 Furthermore perturbations to this developmental tra- jectory as evidenced by reduced microbial diversity or dysbiosis during early life has been linked to disorders in infancy and childhood.Pregnancy and lactationIn the first article Chu and colleagues from the labora- tory of Kjersti Aagaard reviewed how maternal nutri- tion during pregnancy and lactation affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota of the offspring.They discuss the concept that gut microbes should be considered as a mediating factor in the rela- tionship between early life nutrition and later life dis- ease as a component of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease DOHaD hypothesis.

Recent work from her laboratory and others have shown that the intrauterine environment of healthy pregnancies is not sterile supporting the potential for the microbiome to influence fetal developmental processes in utero as well as the maternal-fetal transmission of microbiota during pregnancy.

Although additional preclinical and clinical research is needed in this area the potential for nutri- tion to influence the maternal-fetal microbiota axis to influence neonatal development prenatally and during breastfeeding is compelling.InfancyIn the next article Davis and coauthors from the labora- tory of Sharon Donovan reviewed the development ofthe infant gut microbiome in the first year of life and how that process is influenced by breast- versus formula-feed- ing prebiotic and probiotic addition to infant formula and the addition of solid foods.Despite the fact that the infant diet is much more homogenous than that of adult populations geographical variation exists - even among infants in economically developed countries in Europe.

These microbiota changes are clinically relevant as they were correlated with increased frailty and markers for inflammation and that the associations between the microbiota and health outcomes was strongest in long-stay subjects.

More recently the same group showed that elderly subjects who were placed in residential facilities exhib- ited a change in their microbiota composition from one associated with health and youth to an elderly- associated microbiota.
