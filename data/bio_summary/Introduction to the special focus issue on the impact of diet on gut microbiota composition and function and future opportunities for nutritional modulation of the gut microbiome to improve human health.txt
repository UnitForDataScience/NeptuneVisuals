overall dietary patterns as well as perturbations such undernutrition and obesity as well as the effects of dietary fiberprebiotics and fat composition are explored .across the life-spanintestinal microbiota development is a complex process that begins in utero and continues for the first 2-3 y of life.delineating this process in diverse populations ofc 2017 taylor  francisfigure 1. schematic representation of articles in the special focus issue relative to life stage and nutrition.infants and how it can be manipulated through diet is clinically important since current evidence suggest that the microbiota acquired in early life can program gas- trointestinal immune and neural development.23-26 furthermore perturbations to this developmental tra- jectory as evidenced by reduced microbial diversity or dysbiosis during early life has been linked to disorders in infancy and childhood.pregnancy and lactationin the first article chu and colleagues from the labora- tory of kjersti aagaard reviewed how maternal nutri- tion during pregnancy and lactation affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota of the offspring.they discuss the concept that gut microbes should be considered as a mediating factor in the rela- tionship between early life nutrition and later life dis- ease as a component of the developmental origins of health and disease dohad hypothesis.

the authors proposed that to more fully understand the ontogeny of the infant microbiota a collaborative study that obtains stool samples from a large cohort of infants located in various sites around the globe in which detailed records of dietary intake and other environmental factors are collected is needed to provide a more complete understanding of the development of the microbiota in infants who are breast- vs. formula-fed.older agethe next paper in the supplement from the laboratory of clara de los reyes-gavil'an focuses on the other end of the age spectrum by reviewing how changes in physiologic function dietary intake and nutritional status affect the microbiome in aged populations.

in her review hannah holscher summarizes the current evidence linking dietary fiber and prebiotic consumption to human gastrointestinal microbiota composition and function including the effects of physiochemical properties of the complex carbohydrates adequate intake and treatment dosages and the phenotypic composition of the human micro- biota.in addition to human trials animal in vitro and computational research are all needed to advance our understanding of the physiologic effects of dietary fibers and prebiotics in both healthy and disease states and to delineate mechanisms of action.future opportunities for nutritional modulation of the gut microbiome to improve human healththe gut microbiome also referred to as our second genome integrates external signals to exert nutri- tional metabolic and immunomodulatory functions that are relevant to health and well-being of the host.there are immense opportunities to use per- sonalized nutritional interventions to prevent andor treat acute and chronic diseases including gastrointes- tinaland fatty liver diseasesobesitycardiovas- cular disease and even neuropsychiatric disorders.

recent work from her laboratory and others have shown that the intrauterine environment of healthy pregnancies is not sterile supporting the potential for the microbiome to influence fetal developmental processes in utero as well as the maternal-fetal transmission of microbiota during pregnancy.

although additional preclinical and clinical research is needed in this area the potential for nutri- tion to influence the maternal-fetal microbiota axis to influence neonatal development prenatally and during breastfeeding is compelling.infancyin the next article davis and coauthors from the labora- tory of sharon donovan reviewed the development ofthe infant gut microbiome in the first year of life and how that process is influenced by breast- versus formula-feed- ing prebiotic and probiotic addition to infant formula and the addition of solid foods.despite the fact that the infant diet is much more homogenous than that of adult populations geographical variation exists - even among infants in economically developed countries in europe.

these microbiota changes are clinically relevant as they were correlated with increased frailty and markers for inflammation and that the associations between the microbiota and health outcomes was strongest in long-stay subjects.

more recently the same group showed that elderly subjects who were placed in residential facilities exhib- ited a change in their microbiota composition from one associated with health and youth to an elderly- associated microbiota.

salazar and colleagues proposed that strategies directed at restoring the microbiota in the elderly must be addressed from a global perspective and nutritional strategies can use probiotics prebiotics or specific nutrients to counter- balance alterations associated with aging.effects of nutritional statusour gut microbial consortia provide nutrients and energy to the host via the fermentation of non-digestible dietary components.in the healthy state d'etente is maintained between the microbiome and the metabolism and immune system of the host.

however dysbioses can lead to inflammation and infection and possible contributionsto diabetes mellitus and obesity.indeed alterations in the gut microbiota diversity and composition have been reported in states of under-and over-nutrition obe- sity and its co-morbidities including type 2 diabe- tes.a number of potential mechanisms have been proposed to describe how the gut microbiota drives obe- sity and its metabolic complications including interac- tion with metabolic processes and the immune system of the host.

however there is a growing appreciation for the concept that an abnormal gut microbial population associated with malnutrition can perpetuate the vicious cycle of path- ophysiology which can lead to persistent growth impairment in children.velly and colleagues high- light the differences in the composition and function of gut microbiota between undernourished and healthy children and review the factors specific to the host and the environment including diet that pro- duce this altered microbiome and the consequences to the host physiology.

in their review martinez and coauthors from the eugene chang's laboratory highlight the impact of obesity and western diets on the gut microbiota and focus on the effect of high fat diets including the level and type of fat consumed and how rapidly diet-induced shiftsin the microbiome occur.

they conclude that diet-induced differences in microbiome composition and microbial metabolites such as volatile fatty acids secondary bile acids and products of protein degradation have the potential to modulate the host environment for disease prevention or promotion.given that metabolic effects of plant and animal-based diets are likely driven by differences in macronutrient and phytochemical intake these components are also discussed in the review.the authors summarize areas where further research is required to realize the potential of exploiting diet- microbiota interactions for improved health which includes a better understanding of the effects of non- nutrient dietary components such as artificial sweet- eners and emerging novel food ingredients on the gut microbiota.dietary fiber and prebioticsthe human host does not contain digestive enzymes that are capable of breaking the molecular linkages contained in most complex carbohydrates and plantpolysaccharides.
