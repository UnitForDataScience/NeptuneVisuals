Kelly and colleagues demonstrated an overall cure rate of 94 in immunosuppressed patients but reported a 14 IBD exacerbation rate which includes both de novo flares of IBD and disease decompensation after FMT raising concern about possible deleterious effects of FMT in patients with IBD with patients with CDI.15 To date there have been several small studies assessing the effect of FMT for CDI in patients with IBD but here we will focus on the 3 largest studies.

Furthermore a recursive search of the bib- liographies of all relevant articles was completed.RESULTSFecal Microbiota Transplantation for the Treatment of Clostridium difficile Infection in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease The Current LandscapeOver the last decade there has been an increase in the incidence and severity of CDI that has been attributed to more virulent and treatment refractory strains56 and its impact has been especially pernicious in patients with IBD.7-9 The prevalence of CDI in the IBD population was reported to be 2.5- to 8-fold higher than otherwise matched controls with a 10 lifetime risk of contracting the pathogen.10-13 After an initial course of anti- CDI therapy the CDI recurrence rate is 4.5-fold higher and the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile carrier state is 8-fold greater in patients with IBD compared with non-IBD patients.141710  Inflamm Bowel Dis  Volume 23 Number 10 October 2017Nevertheless patients with IBD with CDI tend to improve on standard of care anti-CDI antibiotics suggesting that prompt treat- ment of CDI may prevent colectomy.

Itwas noted that patients with inactive IBD at the time of FMT n22 generally did not require treatment escalation 64.The second study was performed at the University of Minnesota and included patients with preexisting IBD or IBD diagnosed at the time of FMT.17 Endoscopic disease activity as- sessments were performed during the FMT.

In addition as patients with IBD have poorer CDI outcomes including mortality compared with non-IBD patients1020 and FMT by colonoscopic administration seems more effective than upper GI administration and current capsules2122 FMT by colonoscopy may be the ideal delivery modality for patients with IBD for the treatment of CDI.Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease The Current LandscapeThe exact etiology of IBD is unclear however the role of gut microbiota in the etiopathogenesis continues to evolve.

One focuses specifically on pediatric patients a population that has previously demonstrated high response rates.32Lessons for Future StudiesAccumulating evidence suggests that FMT is a promising treatment for CDI among patients with IBD and for underlying IBD.

They enrolled 56 patients 28 UC and 28 CD including 7 patients who had their IBD diagnosed at the time of FMT.

Interestingly they found that 23 of patients experienced a late failure 3-12 mo post-FMT after being confirmed as negative by stool testing at the 2-month post-FMT visit although it's unclear if this was reinfection.Last Fischer et al18 conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study assessing patients who underwent FMT for recurrent or refractory CDI with concurrent IBD.

However there is limited data focusing on efficacy and safety profile of FMT in patients with C. difficile infection with underlying inflammatory bowel disease IBD including the risk of IBD flare.

Here we aim to review the current landscape of this rapidly developing field mapping the efficacy and safety of FMT 1 to treat C. difficile infection in patients with IBD 2 to treat underlying IBD and 3 outline ongoing clinical trials and the future of the microbiome space.Inflamm Bowel Dis 2017231710-1717Key Words inflammatory bowel disease fecal microbiota transplantation ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease microbiomeecal microbiota transplantation FMT has changed the standard of care for Clostridium difficile infection CDI.
