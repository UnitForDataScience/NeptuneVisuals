kelly and colleagues demonstrated an overall cure rate of 94 in immunosuppressed patients but reported a 14 ibd exacerbation rate which includes both de novo flares of ibd and disease decompensation after fmt raising concern about possible deleterious effects of fmt in patients with ibd with patients with cdi.15 to date there have been several small studies assessing the effect of fmt for cdi in patients with ibd but here we will focus on the 3 largest studies.

further trials and deeper microbial characterization such as pma-sequencing are needed to ascertain whether anaerobic preparation preserves important microbial communities that drive remission.31while these trials affirm that fmt is a promising induction treatment in active uc the heterogeneity among these results highlight the need for critical examination of patient character- istics donor factors intervention modality and frequency and clinical endpoints in future study design as well as longer endpoints to understand the role of fmt as maintenance therapy.future of the field active clinical trials for the use of fmt for cdi in patients with ibdwhile there are several studies assessing fmt for the treatment of cdi at various stages as well as fmt for the treatment of ibd currently there are only 2 open-label trials1714  assessing the safety and efficacy of fmt in patients with both cdi and ibd table 2. our group is currently enrolling a trial nct03106844 aimed at assessing the efficacy of fmt in cdi in adult patients with underlying ibd and will be following ibd clinical outcomes post-fmt.

furthermore a recursive search of the bib- liographies of all relevant articles was completed.resultsfecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease the current landscapeover the last decade there has been an increase in the incidence and severity of cdi that has been attributed to more virulent and treatment refractory strains56 and its impact has been especially pernicious in patients with ibd.7-9 the prevalence of cdi in the ibd population was reported to be 2.5- to 8-fold higher than otherwise matched controls with a 10 lifetime risk of contracting the pathogen.10-13 after an initial course of anti- cdi therapy the cdi recurrence rate is 4.5-fold higher and the prevalence of toxigenic c. difficile carrier state is 8-fold greater in patients with ibd compared with non-ibd patients.141710  inflamm bowel dis  volume 23 number 10 october 2017nevertheless patients with ibd with cdi tend to improve on standard of care anti-cdi antibiotics suggesting that prompt treat- ment of cdi may prevent colectomy.

itwas noted that patients with inactive ibd at the time of fmt n22 generally did not require treatment escalation 64.the second study was performed at the university of minnesota and included patients with preexisting ibd or ibd diagnosed at the time of fmt.17 endoscopic disease activity as- sessments were performed during the fmt.

in addition as patients with ibd have poorer cdi outcomes including mortality compared with non-ibd patients1020 and fmt by colonoscopic administration seems more effective than upper gi administration and current capsules2122 fmt by colonoscopy may be the ideal delivery modality for patients with ibd for the treatment of cdi.fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease the current landscapethe exact etiology of ibd is unclear however the role of gut microbiota in the etiopathogenesis continues to evolve.

however there is limited data focusing on efficacy and safety profile of fmt in patients with c. difficile infection with underlying inflammatory bowel disease ibd including the risk of ibd flare.

here we aim to review the current landscape of this rapidly developing field mapping the efficacy and safety of fmt 1 to treat c. difficile infection in patients with ibd 2 to treat underlying ibd and 3 outline ongoing clinical trials and the future of the microbiome space.inflamm bowel dis 2017231710-1717key words inflammatory bowel disease fecal microbiota transplantation ulcerative colitis crohn's disease microbiomeecal microbiota transplantation fmt has changed the standard of care for clostridium difficile infection cdi.

four random- ized clinical trials and a number of meta-analyses suggest a nearly 90 cure rate of fmt for the treatment of recurrent cdi with a tolerable safety profile.1 however there is limited data focusing on efficacy and safety profile of fmt in patients with cdi with inflammatory bowel disease ibd including the risk of ibd flare.

search terms included alternatives of fmt combined with varied terms of ibd but not limited to crohn's disease cd uc and ibd.

regarding ibd more than half of the patients n19 required ibd treat- ment escalation with glucocorticoids n5 anti-tnf therapy n7 or vedolizumab n3.

as observed across these studies patients with ibd with more severe disease at the time of fmt are more likely to have flares or need increased ibd therapy post- fmt.

there are currently 5 active trials of fmt in cd table 4. one focuses specifically on pediatric patients a population that has previously demonstrated high response rates.32lessons for future studiesaccumulating evidence suggests that fmt is a promising treatment for cdi among patients with ibd and for underlying ibd.

while treatment of cdi generally requires a single treatment for most  1715table 4. active clinical trials in cdaas reported on clinicaltrials.gov and ictrp updated as of may 29 2017.en enteral nutrition mnz metronidazole ng nasogastric nr not reported rct randomized controlled trial.patients results from a number of studies reveal that efficacy improves with multiple fmts particularly in patients with severe and severe-complicated cdi fischer et al 62 initial cure rate versus 93 overall cure rate.35-37 for the treatment of ibd maintenance therapy will likely be needed to induce lasting remission similar to other therapies used in ibd.

furthermore such foundational knowledge may help to guide development of future innovations such as anaero- bic delivery of full microbial communities or selective enhance- ment of key micobes which could lead to defined rationally selected microbiome-based therapeutics.the proliferation of research on fmt use in patients with ibd over the past few years has provided exciting evidence supporting the use of this novel intervention and highlighting the potential for development new microbial therapies to treat ibd.
