when pooling organs together within animals average otu richness was 47 - 06 otus which is 215 - 084 otus boot- strapped mean and 95 confidence interval greater than the average otu richness of the heart.we determined that bacterial assemblages differ between organs permanova pseudo-f451  137 p  0001 and between locations pseudo-f151 1177 p  0003. the organ-location interaction term was also significant pseudo-f451  129 p  0027 suggesting that location effects are not the same across organs see supplementary material 3 for additional analysis.adding organs increased the average otu richness of each animal  adding the kidney increased the average animal-level otu richness by one otu and the addition of the spleen increased the average otu richness by 08 otu.

organ type influences bacterial assemblage composition in a systematic way permanova 999 permutations pseudo-f451  137 p  0001. our results demonstrate that the number of organs sampled influences the ability to detect bacterial pathogens which can inform sampling decisions in public health and wildlife ecology.key words arvicola terrestris high-throughput sequencing bacterial pathogens rodent-borne pathogen tissue selection.gaps in our understanding of bacterial species distri- butions functions and communities are of particular interest within wildlife ecology because pathogens bacterial or otherwise have the potential to regulate author for correspondence petra villette umr chrono-environnementuniversitedebourgogne franche-comte la bouloie 16 route de gray besancon cedex 25030 france.email rhost populations  which can in turn drive ecosys- tem dynamics.

to determine if pooling organ data significantly increased otu richness we used boot- strapping 999 iterations to estimate the average dif- ference with 95 confidence intervals between the heart and pooled otu richness within animals.we calculated jaccard's presenceabsence dissimilar- ity indices between each organ within animals to quan- tify bacterial assemblage differences and we used the adonis function in the vegan package  to perform a permanova permutational multivariate analysis of variance on the jaccard dissimilarities to determine if bacterial assemblages within organs were non- random.

comparing multiple organ tissues within the same rodent has been done before for single bacterial species   but to our knowledge the present study is the first to survey multiple organs for their bacterial assemblages.our objectives were the following first describe the bacterial pathogens present in 13 a. terrestris heart liver lung kidney and spleen tissues.

these results also suggest that cross-contamination between organs during the dissection and collection process was not significant if significant cross- contamination had occurred we would expect bacterial assemblages obtained from different organs within an animal to be similar.the differences we detected in bacterial assem- blages within organs may be due in part by spatial and temporal dynamics of bacterial infections.

including the least-rich organs last the liver and lung still increased average otu richness by 02 otus each.we failed to detect differences in average otu rich- ness between organs but we determined that bacterial assemblages vary between organs within individuals if all of the organs within an animal had the same bac- terial assemblages we would expect the otu accumu- lation analysis to show no increase in average otu richness with increasing number of organs.

average otu richness within each organ ranged from 15 -04 mean - standard error to 25 - 04 otusorgan  and in general did not differ significantly between organs with the exception of the average lung otu richness which is marginally significantly lower than the average heart otu richness .

rodents can also be reservoir species for zoonotic bacteria around the world .the development of high-throughput sequencing and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing approaches which allows for the simultaneous identification of multiple bacterial species in large sample sizes now allows for the study of bacterial communities within hosts and host populations   but methodological questions still remain.

we identified 24 bacteria representing 17 genera average bacterial richness for each organ ranged from 15 - 04 mean - standard error to 25 - 04 bacteriaorgan and did not differ significantly between organs.

the average bacterial richness when organ assemblages were pooled within animals was 47 - 06 bacteriaanimal operational taxonomic unit accumulation analysis indicates that all five organs are required to obtain this.

we hypothesized that bacterial assemblages would differ in richness and membership among tissue types because the five organs we have targeted differ in both function and potential exposure routes.

we used the betadisper function in the vegan package to check for homogeneity of dispersions of the groups and set the number of permutations to 999. we also performed a permanova analysis to determine if bacterial assemblages differ between ani- mals see supplementary material 4 for details.we performed an otu accumulation analysis to assess the effect of including more than one organ in cal- culating animal otu richness.

this suggests that a holistic approach is better suited to surveying bacteria in this species as bacterial assemblages within different organs within the same animal vary in both richness and membership.

we calculated the average number of otus detected in each tissue sample otu richness as well as the average otu richness in each animal when tissues were pooled together.

organs were included in the otu richness calculation for each animal in order of decreasing average otu richness first the heart then the kidneys then the spleen then the liver then the lungs.
