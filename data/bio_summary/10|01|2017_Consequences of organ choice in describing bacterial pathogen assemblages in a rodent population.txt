To determine if pooling organ data significantly increased OTU richness we used boot- strapping 999 iterations to estimate the average dif- ference with 95 confidence intervals between the heart and pooled OTU richness within animals.We calculated Jaccard's presenceabsence dissimilar- ity indices between each organ within animals to quan- tify bacterial assemblage differences and we used the adonis function in the vegan package  to perform a PERMANOVA permutational multivariate analysis of variance on the Jaccard dissimilarities to determine if bacterial assemblages within organs were non- random.

Comparing multiple organ tissues within the same rodent has been done before for single bacterial species   but to our knowledge the present study is the first to survey multiple organs for their bacterial assemblages.Our objectives were the following first describe the bacterial pathogens present in 13 A. terrestris heart liver lung kidney and spleen tissues.

These results also suggest that cross-contamination between organs during the dissection and collection process was not significant if significant cross- contamination had occurred we would expect bacterial assemblages obtained from different organs within an animal to be similar.The differences we detected in bacterial assem- blages within organs may be due in part by spatial and temporal dynamics of bacterial infections.

When pooling organs together within animals average OTU richness was 47 - 06 OTUs which is 215 - 084 OTUs boot- strapped mean and 95 confidence interval greater than the average OTU richness of the heart.We determined that bacterial assemblages differ between organs PERMANOVA pseudo-F451  137 P  0001 and between locations pseudo-F151 1177 P  0003.

Including the least-rich organs last the liver and lung still increased average OTU richness by 02 OTUs each.We failed to detect differences in average OTU rich- ness between organs but we determined that bacterial assemblages vary between organs within individuals if all of the organs within an animal had the same bac- terial assemblages we would expect the OTU accumu- lation analysis to show no increase in average OTU richness with increasing number of organs.

Average OTU richness within each organ ranged from 15 -04 mean - standard error to 25 - 04 OTUsorgan  and in general did not differ significantly between organs with the exception of the average lung OTU richness which is marginally significantly lower than the average heart OTU richness .

The organ-location interaction term was also significant pseudo-F451  129 P  0027 suggesting that location effects are not the same across organs see Supplementary Material 3 for additional analysis.Adding organs increased the average OTU richness of each animal  adding the kidney increased the average animal-level OTU richness by one OTU and the addition of the spleen increased the average OTU richness by 08 OTU.

Rodents can also be reservoir species for zoonotic bacteria around the world .The development of high-throughput sequencing and 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing approaches which allows for the simultaneous identification of multiple bacterial species in large sample sizes now allows for the study of bacterial communities within hosts and host populations   but methodological questions still remain.

We identified 24 bacteria representing 17 genera average bacterial richness for each organ ranged from 15 - 04 mean - standard error to 25 - 04 bacteriaorgan and did not differ significantly between organs.
