The blots bands were scanned for densitometry analysis with the value obtained from colon cancer patients' para-cancer tissues set as 1.While CK8 and CK8- mice treated with AOM and DSS each developed colonic tumors the tumor incidence was significantly greater in CK8- mice than in WT mice after the second cycle of DSS treatment Figure 2C and the colon length was shortened in the CK8- group Figure 2D.

When we examined the histology of Swiss-rolled colons stained with HE CK8- colons mainly exhibited distal injuries including epithelial ulcers submucosal edemas and inflammatory infiltrates indicating that more severe injuries had occurred in the CK8- mice Figure 4C.We further investigated the expression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in WT and CK8- mice.

We administered a specific TNFa antagonist etanercept to CK8- mice that had been treated with DSS however etanercept did not reduce the incidence of tumorigenesis data not shown suggesting that TNFa is not essential for AOM DSS-induced colorectal carcinogenesis in CK8- mice.A previous study suggested that CK8 together with IL-6 protects the epithelial barrier from direct luminal damage such as that from DSS and the accompanyingFigure 2 Knockdown of CK8 promotes susceptibility to AOMDSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal carcinoma.A CK8 mice and CK8- mice were treated with AOMDSS as Material and Methods described.

These results suggest that the greater colonic inflammation and tumor development in CK8- mice is associated with greatercolonic permeability.Fecal microbiota of CK8- mice differ from those of WT mice after AOMDSS treatmentWe next examined whether CK8- mice predisposed to developing CAC had different colonic microbiota than WT mice.

P  0.05 P  0.01.These results indicate that the gut microbiota might have contributed to the increased colitis and colitis- associated tumorigenesis in CK8- mice.TLR4 inhibitor treatment reduces the vulnerability of CK8- mice to colitis induced by DSSAs described above the phylum Proteobacteria was significantly upregulated in CRC CK8- mice.

Using CK8 heterozygous knockout mice CK8- we found that CK8- mice are highly susceptible to DSS-induced colitis and more prone to AOMDSS-induced CAC than wild type WT mice.

As shown in Figure 1B CK8 expression was significantly reduced in both CK8 and CK8- mice after AOMDSS treatment however by the end of the third cycle the expression of CK8 was almost undetectable in CK8- mice.Given the above observations we predicted that CK8 expression might decrease during the development of colonic inflammation and colon cancers.

During AOM and DSS treatment CK8- mice exhibited greater mortality than WT mice Figure 2A and by day 95 about 40 of the CK8- mice had died.

While tumors were mostly found in the colorectal and distal portions of the WT colon tumors were frequently observed along the whole length of the CK8- colon.We also counted Ki-67-stained cells and found a larger number of positive cells in CK8- tumors than in WT tumors Figure 2H suggesting that the downregulation of CK8 enhances the proliferation of tumor cells.

While DSS induced weight loss in both CK8 and CK8- mice a greater extent of weight loss was apparent in CK8- mice by day 7 Figure 4A.
