Under both alternative models we generated 1000 datasets to assess the power.To test the association between the simulated microbiome composition and gene expressions data six different methods were applied including KRV test GRV test Gene Association with Multiple Traits GAMuT test Broadaway et al.

For the KRV test and HSIC test we applied the Gaussian kernel to both X and Y to test independence Gretton et al.

MMiRKAT incorporates a small-sample adjustment to a MSKAT-type test so that the test has a better finite-sample behavior Zhan et al.

Unlike other methods which suffer from huge power loss under certain scenarios the proposed KRV test is always one of the most powerful method in testing the association between OTUs and gene expressions and always has an adequate power under each scenario.Analysis of host transcriptome and microbiome dataWe further applied the KRV test to a dataset from an inflammatory bowel disease IBD study Morgan et al.

We compared our KRV test to the HSIC test and distance covariance dcov test both of which have been widely used for testing statistical independence between two random vectors.

As a benchmark we also compared the GRV test which has the same test design as the KRV test but uses distance metrics rather than kernels.

We also provide an implementation of KRV in R language.Zhan et al.Page 2IntroductionThe human body is inhabited by many complex communities of microorganisms and their composition defined as the microbiome have been increasingly recognized to play an important role in many human disease conditions including obesity Turnbaugh et al.

It turns out that this KRV statistic is closely related to existing statistics that measure multivariate statistical independence including the Hilbert-Schmidt independenceZhan et al.Page 3criterion HSIC Gretton et al.

To adjust for the potential confounding effects of X in KRV framework we utilize the residual-basedZhan et al.Page 8strategy as widely used in many kernel machine association tests Liu et al.

Finally B  10000 permutations were used in the dcov testZhan et al.Page 9Szekely et al.
