Very low calorie diets can produce weight loss of 11-16 kg at 12 mo with persistent weight loss of 1-2 kg at 4-6 years with a very wide variation in long term results.

He found that low-fat diets cause weight loss proportional to pretreatment body weight and weight loss is correlated positively to the reduction in dietary fat content.

After major weight loss an ad libitum low-fat diet program appeared to be superior to caloric counting in maintaining the weight loss 2 years later.

A Cochrane meta- analysis from Hooper confirmed the weight loss effectsLong term caloric reduction and weight loss induces a reduction in resting metabolic rate that is usually greater than expected by the lean tissue loss3 and increased energy efficiency of digestion and absorption and movement4 all of which make weight maintenance a difficult proposition.

Long term weight maintenance after large weight losses in the National Weight Control Register is associated with frequent self-monitoring of body weight and food intake consistency of food intake always eating breakfast low variety of food low fat low fast food intakes and high levels of regular physical activity 10-11 mJwk although none of these behaviors may be causally related to weight maintenance Once these successful maintainers have maintained a weight loss for 2-5 years the chances of longer-term success greatly increase910.LOW FAT DIETSof a low fat diet compared with usual diet with an effect size of 1.5 kg20.HIGH PROTEIN DIETSHigh protein weight loss diets reduce the intake of carbohydrate and fat but maintain protein intake to take advantage of their greater satiety 10-15 less food intake after a protein preload21 and thermic effects.
