The sequence duplication level was 23.87 for 10 ng MGRG sample 22.63 for 5 ng MGRG sample 26.76 for 1 ng MGRG sample 38.75 for 0.5 ng sample and 29.81 for the unamplified sample.There were no significantly over-represented se- quences reported in the FastQC files for any of the samples except for the MDA carousel floor sample.

The degree of REPLI-g MDA bias was evaluated by sequence metrics species composition and cross- validating observed species abundance and species diversity estimates using the One Codex and MetaPhlAn taxonomic classification tools.

Of the 16 species detected in the unamplified Ferris wheel door sample 15 were detected in the paired REPLI-g sample.

Of the 39 species detected in the unamplified Thunderbolt sample only 12 were detected in the paired REPLI-g sample.

Two additional species were detected in the REPLI-g sample that were not detected in the paired unamplified sample.

Of the 110 species detected in the unamplified carousel sample 61 were detected in the paired REPLI-g sample.

Whereas 15 species were detected in the unamplified railing sample the sequencing coverage was not even enough in the paired REPLI-g sample to perform automated abundance estimation and false- positive filtering.

However the carousel- and Thunderbolt-amplified samples had 2-3 additional species that were not detected in their unamplified counterparts.However despite relatively high concordance of species abundance in the samples REPLI-g WGA often resulted in fewer species detected.

B The MGRG 10 ng sample has a depth is 24.6 6 243.63 with 38.3 of the genome covered and 98.1 of identity.C The MGRG 5 ng sample had 75.99 of 2478166 as classified reads.

Note that in most cases the REPLI-g hits fall in the unamplified hits with 6 and 1 species being found only in the REPLI-g sample and not in the unamplified results A and D respectively.
