The percentage of avocado in the diet had varying effects in altering the biomarkers whereby diet containing 15 avocado was the more effective diet.

Bentley-Hewitt2Published online 26 May 2017 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York 2017Abstract This study investigated the impact of diets contain- ing various levels of avocado 5 10 and 15 on gut health in rats fed for six weeks.

No significant changes in intestinal bacterial populations ileum cecum and colon were found in rats fed avocado diets compared to the control diet.

Among the avocado diets colonic mucin 3 and 4 gene expression and the number of goblet cells mucin- producing cells were significantly higher in rats fed 15 avocado diet.

The percentage of avo- cado in the diet influenced gut health measures with 15 dietary avocado being the most effective.
