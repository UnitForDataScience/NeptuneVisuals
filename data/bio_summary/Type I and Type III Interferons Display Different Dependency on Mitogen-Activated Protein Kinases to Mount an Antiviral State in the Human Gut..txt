however contrary to type i ifn the antiviral activity induced by type iii ifn is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases mapks signaling pathway suggesting a pathway used by type iii ifns that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state.resultstype iii ifn is produced during viral infection of human mini-gut organoidsthe roles of type i and iii ifns at mucosal surfaces and in epithelial cells have been extensively studied in mice     .

all together these results show that either type i or iii ifns confer t84 cells lines an anti- viral state and that t84 cells phenocopy the antiviral response generated by primary hiecs in the context of mini-gut organoid.type i and iii ifn signaling pathways independently mediate an antiviral state in human iecsto test whether types i and iii ifns act in combination or separately in establishing the antiviral state of iecs we generated t84 cell lines deficient for either the ifn alpha ifnar or the ifn lambda ifnlr receptor using crisprcas9 technology.

differences in the affinity of type i and iii ifns for their respective receptor or differences in the amount of type i and iii ifn receptors at the surface of hiecs might be partially responsible for the observed differences in the magnitude of isg expression.functional characterization of type iii ifn and comparison to type i ifn suggests that both cytokines are functionally redun- dant by inducing the same set of isgs   .

these observa- tions strongly suggest that type i and iii ifns are secreted from cells by two distinct mechanisms.although type iii ifn stimulation of hiecs results in signifi- cantly less induction of isgs compared to type i ifn  figure s3 in supplementary material we found that type iii ifn was only slightly less potent in protecting the cell against viral infection and .

all together these data demonstrate that in human t84 cells either type i or iii ifns are capable of independently mediating antiviral protection.map kinases are required for type iii but not type i ifn antiviral activity in hiecstype i and iii ifn signaling and antiviral activity are depend- ent on the jakstat pathway and inhibition of stat1 phosphorylation blocks the production of isgs and inhibits ifn-mediated antiviral protection -.

transcriptome analysis of t84 cells treated with either type i or iii ifn revealed that type i ifn consistently inducedhigher transcript levels across all induced isgs figure s3c in supplementary material.to determine the antiviral potency of type i and iii ifns in t84 cells we pre-treated t84 cells with increasing concentrations of each ifn prior infection with mrv.

complementarily ko of ifnlr renders hiecs more susceptible to viral infection .considering our results that only type iii ifn is secreted by hiecs it is tempting to propose that iecs have evolved to favor type iii ifn over type i ifn as it allows for similar protection against pathogens while limiting production of isgs.

this type iii ifn restricted dependence on mapks was independent of ifn concentration figure s5c in supplementary material validating that the non-dependence of type i ifn for mapks was not the result of differences in the ifn concentration used to stimulate the cells.

contrary to type i ifn the antiviral activity induced by type iii ifn is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway suggesting a pathway used by type iii ifns that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state.

we also observed a continuous increase in isg mrna levels as the concentration of type i ifn increased whereas isg transcript levels quickly reached a plateau in type iii ifn-treated cells.to evaluate whether type i andor iii ifn protect primary human iecs from viral infection organoid cultures were treatedas well as by quantification of viral replication using qrt-pcr.

all together these results demonstrate the antiviral protective role of both type i and iii ifns in colon ileum and jejunum derived hiecs.with 8 ngml of type i ifn ifn-b equivalent 2000 ruml see materials and methods or 300 ngml of type iii ifn ifn-l1-3 prior to exposure to mrv.

however type i ifn can be detected in the supernatant if added exogenously to inhibit viral infection data not shown.to address whether t84 iecs respond to either type i and iii ifns we treated t84 iecs with type i or iii ifn and measured the expression levels of isgs at different time points post-ifn treat- ment.

however the restriction of type iii ifn receptor to epithelium cells suggests that type iii ifn might have unique functions or provide specific advantages at epithelial surfaces.

as shown in  ifnar-- cells were no longer able to phosphorylate pstat1 and induceisgs after type i ifn treatment but remained fully responsive to type iii ifn indicating a selective disruption of the type i ifn signaling pathway.

a t84 cell lines were treated with type i ifn b 2000 ruml equivalent 8 ngml or type iii ifn l1-3 300 ngml for 1 h and ifn signaling was measured by immunoblotting for pstat1 y701.
