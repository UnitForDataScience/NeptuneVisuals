both analyses showed significant group differences in the mean number of times of respiratory illness and mean numbers of days of sore throat cough and runny nose table 4. a significant interaction effect was also detected in the number of times for respiratory illness indicating that the response profiles differed between groups table 4.gut microbiota profilesa total of 116 subjects fully complied for faecal collections at both 0- and 10-months n61 from the placebo group and n55 from the bb536 group.

over the 10-month study period children supplemented with bb536 had 46.1 fewer total number of days for sore throat p0.018 compared to the placebo group with marginal reduction for duration of fever reduced by 27.8 p0.084 runny nose reduced by 13.2 p0.087 and cough reduced by 16.3 p0.087 as compared to the placebo table 3.table 2. group differences of total number of occurrence or days of clinical symptoms of diarrhoea across 10 months of study period.1table 3. group differences of total number of occurrence or days of clinical symptoms of upper respiratory illnesses across 10 months of study period.1univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of bb536 over 10-month study period.

over 10-months changes in abundance were observed in actinobacteria bb536 group p0.05 bacteroidetes placebo group p0.05 bb536 group p0.01 and proteobacteria bb536 group p0.05.

altogether our present study illustrated the potential protective effects of bb536 against upper respiratory illnesses in pre-school malaysian children with gut microbiota modulating properties.keywords bifidobacterium longum bb536 upper respiratory gastrointestinal gut microbiotaintroductionrespiratory illnesses represent one of the major health issues among children with acute respiratory infections recorded as the primary culprit for paediatric morbidity and mortality among children under five years old wang et al.

baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups of these fully complied children were also insignificantly different p0.05 table 1. age sex and bmi were similarly distributed in both bb536 and placebo groups mean age of 4 years old and mean bmi range of 15.5-16.0 kgm2 healthy 5th to 75th percentile.gastrointestinal illnessesoral administration of bb536 did not exert significant effects against gastrointestinal illnesses such as the number of days and times for diarrhoea and the number of days for symptoms such as fever and vomiting between bb536 andtable 1. baseline characteristics of study participants.1placebo groups table 2. total number of times and days over the 10-month study period also did not significantly differ between bb536 and placebo data not shown.upper respiratory illnessesthe effects of bb536 against upper respiratory illnesses were assessed via the number of times for occurrences the number of days for upper respiratory illnesses and the number of days for symptoms such as fever sore throat cough and runny nose.

2005. in another study significant reduction in clinical symptoms of respiratory infections were observed with sample size of 201 subjects where a significant reduction in fever by 1 day and cough by 5 days among children withtable 5. the proportions of bacterial phylum in faecal microbiota.1table 6. the proportions of bacterial genus in the faecal microbiota.1common cold relative to placebo group were recorded rerksuppaphol and rerksuppaphol 2012.in malaysia respiratory illnesses peak in the dry season of midyear april to june and wet season during year end october to december sam et al.

the results pcoa at genus level are shown in figure 1. permutational manova revealed significant differences between 0 and 10 months in bb536 group mean0.4758 p0.002 however there was no significant difference between the 0 and 10 months in placebo group mean0.2515 p0.1043 suggesting a modulating effect on the microbiota by the probiotic ingestion.table 5 shows the proportion of each bacterial group at phylum level.

2015. thus to monitor efficacy of any dietary interventions against respiratory illnesses a long period study is needed.our present study covered both these peak seasons for respiratory illnesses.

principal coordinate analysis at genus level of the gut microbiota revealed significant differences between 0 and 10 months in the bb536 group p0.01 but not in placebo group p0.05.

the abundance of the genus faecalibacterium which is associated with anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties was significantly higher in the bb536 group p0.05 compared to the placebo group.

as the data were count data and taken repeatedly on the same subjects over time poisson regression with generalised estimating equations model which included group time group-by-time interaction and covariates age gender and bmi were used to compare overall group differences across the study period.

all statistical analyses for clinical outcomes were performed using sas version 9.4 sas institute inc. cary nc usa and analyses for microbiota compositions were performed using spss version 23.0 statistical software ibm armonk ny usa.resultsbaseline characteristicsa total of 520 children were enrolled in the study with 259 children randomised into the bb536 group and 261 into the placebo group.

only 219 children 109 from the bb536 group and 110 from the placebo group completely complied for the questionnaire data collection over 10 months.

there was no intergroup difference with the exception of a lower abundance p0.04 of proteobacteria in the placebo group compared to the bb536 group at 0 month.

pcoa at genus level revealed significant differences between 0 and 10 months in bb536 group p0.002 but no significant difference was observed in the placebo group.
