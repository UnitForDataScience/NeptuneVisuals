the diver- sity of the microorganisms in the gut can suppress fatty acid oxidation in the muscle via mechanisms involving inhibition of ampk and favor adiposity and insulin resistance 7175.the activation of ampk and fasting-induced adipose factor fiaf lead to an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase lpl an enzyme that regulates triacylglycerol metabolism and that can be modulated by the microbiota 72. fiaf participation in lipid metabolism was reinforced when it was shown that germ-free fiaf22 mice were not protected from diet-induced obesity and they demonstrated increased weight gain intra- abdominal adiposity and higher leptin and insulin levels despite similar food intake comparing with fiaf11 mice 75. this set of experiments demonstrated for the first time that an environmental factor such as gut microbiota may regulate energy storage 71.a new insight demonstrated that gut microbiota plays an unexpectedly important role in post-dieting weight regain and it could have been avoided or treated by altering microbiome function or composition.

the dichotomy between the biotransformation ofacns into a potentially more bioactive low molecular weight metabolite 33 and modulation of the gut microbiota compo- sition by acns contributes to positive health outcomes 34.acns have a low bioavailability and it is estimated that only 5-10 of the total polyphenol intake is absorbed in the small intestine 22. the food matrix can also influence pheno- lic compound bioavailability during digestion 35. moreover most dietary acns arrive intact at the colon and may interact with the microbiota to be biotransformed and metabolized before being absorbed across the intestinal mucosa 10. this interaction can involve hydrolysis demethylation reduction decarboxylation dehydroxylation or isomerization of these compounds into simpler components that modulate absorption and biological activity 33. the first step in acn bacterial hydrolysis involves cleavage of the sugar moiety leading to the formation of acn aglycon and the second phase includes degradation into simple phenolic acids by the activities of two bacterial enzymes in particular a-l-rhamnosidase and b-d- glucosidase in the small intestine 3637.the degradation of phenolic acids by enteric bacterial or chemical conversions may produce other metabolites includ- ing protocatechuic acid syringic acid vanillic acid phloroglu- cinol aldehyde phloroglucinol acid and gallic acid 3137. these acidic metabolites are probably absorbed through monocarboxylic acids transported by epithelial cells 10. the low level of oxygen in the small and particularly the large intestine should also be considered because low oxygen may protect the acn structure.
