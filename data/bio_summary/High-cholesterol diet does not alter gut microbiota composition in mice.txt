Changes in gut community structure and function have been implied in metabolic syndrome-related conditions such as obesity  type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis Diet emerges as an important factor influencing microbiota composition since nutrient abundance can promote the growth of dif- ferent bacterial groups by affecting bacterial metabolism and adaptability The shift from a low-fat plant- polysaccharide-rich diet towards a high-fat Western style diet has been shown to strongly modify the gut micro- biota within days of administration by increasing the representatives of Mollicutes Erysipelotrichi and Bacilli classes of Firmicutes along the intestinal axis These changes conceivably contribute to metabolic diseasesince the predominance of Firmicutes over Bacteroidetes has been associated with obesity and metabolic syn- drome in both mice and humans High fat diet has effects similar to Western diet on the gut ecosystem resulting in an altered metabolomic signature of dominant phylotypes as Bacteroidetes although this has not been unequivocally established and the diet effect might depend on additional factors such as the choice of model .

However mice fed the high- cholesterol HC diet developed elevated plasma choles- terol levels compared to control mice maintained on the NC diet 39 p  0.01 Table .

An increased ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes has been previously observed in mice fed Western diet  and similar data were obtained in response to a diet con- taining only high fat without added cholesterol .

Mice M1-M3 received no cholesterol in the diet NC mice M4-M6 were fed high cholesterol diet HCshared by literature using a similar experimental design .

Mice were maintained on semisynthetic AIN93G diet D10012G Research Diets until 12 weeks of age when half of them were switched to a 1.25-cholesterol containing re-formulation of the same diet D12110502 Research Diets comparable to previous work  which was then continued for an additional 12 weeks.

The statistical significance threshold we used was an alpha of 0.05.Results and discussionHigh dietary cholesterol intake substantially changes overall cholesterol metabolismThe addition of 1.25 cholesterol to a low fat semisyn- thetic diet for 12 weeks did not induce changes in bodyweight compared to the control diet with no added chol- esterol NC Table .

However HC diet did not induce any appre- ciable change in the distribution of fecal secondary bile acids when compared to the NC group Table The results also indicate that the HC diet did not induce adaptations in microbiota metabolism with respect to bile acid conversion.

These mice were chosen since they represent a widely used model for several aspects of cardio-metabolic disease such as atherosclerosis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis pathologies in which changes in microbiota composition have been mechanistically implicated  Our results demonstrate that the composition of the intestinal microbiota remained remarkably stable despite substan- tial changes occurring in overall cholesterol metabolism in response to the HC diet.

These data furthermore imply that the impact of Western diet on the micro- biota is mediated by its high fat rather than its high cholesterol content.Materials and methodsAnimals and dietsMale B6.129S7-Ldlrtm1Her mice Jackson Laboratories Bay Harbor Maine USA were bred in our facility.

These data indicate consistent with previous findings that feeding a diet enriched in cholesterol re- sults in cholesterol accumulation in plasma and tissues of Ldlr-knockout mice .
