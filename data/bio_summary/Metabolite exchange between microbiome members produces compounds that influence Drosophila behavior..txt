In sum ethanol catabolism is necessary for Drosophila to discriminate between the co-culture and the separate-culture mixture.We next identified additional metabolites unique to the co-culture using solid-phase microextrac- tion gas chromatography-mass spectrometry SPME GC-MS. Acetic acid six acetate esters an acet- aldehyde metabolic derivative acetoin a putative acetaldehyde metabolic derivative 245- trimethyl-13-dioxolane and two unknown metabolites were more abundant in the co-culture rela- tive to the separate-culture mixture or co-culture with A. pomorum adhA  Table 2--source data 1-6.

For each panel the left-most plot compares the co-culture containing S. cerevi- siae and A. malorum to S. cerevisiae grown alone A. malorum grown alone or media AJM apple juice medium the right-most plot compares the co-culture containing S. cerevisiae and A. pomorum wild-type to the co-culture containing S. cerevisiae and A. pomorum adhA since A. pomorum adhA is required for Drosophila co-culture preference Figure 5A.

Esters and acetic acid but not esters alone were sufficient to fully restore the attractiveness of the co-culture containing A. pomorum adhA to the co-culture containing A. pomorum WT levels .Although acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient for Drosophila co-culture prefer-ence acetaldehyde is a reactive intermediate during ethanol catabolism whose metabolic derivatives might be increased in microbial communities compared with individual microbial cultures.

Acetobacter metabolism of Saccharomyces-derived ethanol was necessary and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient for co-culture preference.Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties ethanol catabolism a distinct volatile profile and yeast population decline.

An independent homo- zygous mutant of ORCO also showed reduced attraction to the co-culture whereas the hetero- zygotes ORCO and Or42 were attracted to the co-culture similarly to wild-type flies .ORCO is a required co-receptor for all other Or gene products  and Or42b one of the most conserved olfactory receptors detects esters and 11-diethoxyethane   .

Previous work found that ORCO is fully responsi- ble for the Drosophila attraction to apple cider vinegar  sug- gesting that the behavioral circuit activated by inter-species interactions between S. cerevisiae and A. malorum is distinct from the circuit acti- vated by apple cider vinegar.We speculated that the emergent property of co-culture attractiveness might arise from a dis- tinct metabolic profile of the co-culture.

To test directly whether ethanol catabolism underpinned Drosophila co-culture preference we evalu- ated Drosophila preference for the co-culture harboring a mutant in adhA which encodesFigure 2.

Each data point represents the pH of a co-culture and the mean RIof Drosophila toward the same co-culture.

A The mean rank of the response index of the various Drosophila mutants toward the co-culture was compared with the mean rank of wild-type fly behavior toward the co-culture using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-hoc multiple comparisons testing.

Moreover Dro- sophila preferred the co-culture containing A. pomorum WT to the co-culture containing A. pomorum adhA .
