Although the volunteer's microbiota were able to produce UC no phase II metabolites of this compound were detected in urine.Phase II metabolites of urolithins were isolated from human urine and their structures were fully described based on the NMR spectra.

The developed method yields significant amounts of Phase II metabolites of urolithins which can be then applied to evaluate the in vivo effects and mechanisms of ET microbiota metabolites.

These studies are thus incongruent with the results of pharmacokinetic studies that clearly indicate that glucuronide conjugates are the dominant metabolites present in plasma tissue and urine.

Many xenobiotics derived from food products and medicinal plant materials have been shown to undergo extensive metabolism by gut microbiota resulting in the formation of small molecular metabolites that not only are more bioavailable than parental compounds but also reveal interesting pharmacological properties Kieran and Del Rio 2015.

One of the most widely studied gut microbiota metabolites of natural products are the urolithins.

After absorption urolithins rapidly undergo Phase II metabolism resulting in their presence in plasma and tissues mostly in a conjugated form these metabolites are mainly glucuronides and to a lesser extent sulfates.

The great majority of in vitro experiments were conducted for urolithin aglycones making them incongruent with the results of pharmacokinetic studies that clearly indicate that glucuronide conjugates of urolithins are the dominant metabolites present in plasma tissues and urine Tomas-Barberan et al.

2016.Although urolithin glucuronides are the main metabolites detected in bodily fluids the highly enzymatically active environment of inflammation and cancer sites should be considered as they have the potential to trigger structural alterations.

All analyses were performedusing Statistica 10 software.ResultsProfile of urinary metabolites.

By means of liquid-liquid extraction column chromatography and preparative high-performance liquidchromatography three major glucuronide metabolites were isolated from human urine--GiUA GUA GUB Fig.
