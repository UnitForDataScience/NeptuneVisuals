The diversity of total individual communities as measured by the Chao1 index did segregate samples by geographic locationTable 2Elemental dry weight concentrations mgkg in the sediment samples from the Menez Gwen MG Lucky Strike LS and Rainbow RB hydrothermal vent fields divided into three different sediment depths 0 to 3 cm 03 3 to 5 cm 35 and 5 to 10 cm 510The three subsamples A B and C from each sediment depth were grouped together and analysed within a pool.

did cluster the samples according to MG LS and RB sampling site except for the superficial sediment layer of Rainbow samples RB03 which clustered with LS group of samples.

Both triplots pre- sented a similar sample's ordination where the samples from the three hydrothermal sites formed three distinct groups and a separate group formed by the superficial sediment samples from the Rainbow site RB03 Figs.

The high Fe and Co contents together with the acido- philic thermophilic and methanogenic diversity detected in RB samples suggest that the analysed sediments have a hy- drothermal origin and might have been influenced by moder- ately high-temperature hydrothermalism.ConclusionThis study reports the dominant microbial diversity associated with deep-sea hydrothermal sediment samples from three neighbouring MAR vent fields the Menez Gwen Lucky Strike and Rainbow sites.

Nevertheless this work provides a better understanding of the distribution and ecology of the microbes in these im- portant hydrothermal ecosystems which likely harbour novel phylotypic groups with possibly unique biogeochemical traits and genetic repertoire.Acknowledgements We are thankful to the scientific parties of the BioBaz 2013 cruise in particular to the crew members of the RV 'Pourquoi Pas ' the ROV 'Victor6000' team Ifremer France for their assistance in obtaining the sediment samples Eva Martins and Catia Cardoso for samples handling on board Tomas Melo for map and figures design Ricardo Medeiros from ImageDOP for map data and Valentina Costa for all technical assistance in the laboratory.

The RDA showed a segregation of samples by sediment location but depth- related differences within the sediment from the same site were minimal p  0.1 permutation tests.

Except for the archaeal diversity in MG group of samples Sobs--Archaea MG p  0.004 there were no significant differences between samples from different depths within sediments from the same site.Bacterial and archaeal OTUs showed consistent evenness estimates species distribution within the subsample groups in the three locations sampled Table .

Within the archaeal domain OTUs clustering with representatives of the Marine Group I did con- tribute mostly to the spatial distribution of the LS samples the ones clustering with members of Marine Benthic Group E and Marine Group III contributed to the distribution of RB sam- ples and finally sequences clustering with DHVEG 2 Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vent group 2 and two unclassified Archaea correlated with the distribution of MG samples Fig.

The significance of the results was obtained with the forward selection function in R and confirmed with a permutation test for RDA under reduced model with 999 permutationsMarine Group I mostly in LS samples and in RB superficial sediments RB03 and Sulfurovum Sulfurimonas and two unassigned archaeal OTUs in MG samples was illustrated.

The use of a different primer set in this study more suitable to cover the bacterial diversity in hydrothermal samples may be accounting for these differences.The Gammaproteobacteria relatives present in the MG samples clustered mainly with lineages of sulphur-oxidisingFig.
