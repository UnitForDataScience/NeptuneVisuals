in ls sediments mgi members co- occurred with other phylotypes linked to the nitrogen cycle such as the ammonia-oxidising nitrosococcus and nitrosospira and the nitrite-oxidising nitrospira all previous- ly reported in deep-sea sediments and hydrothermal vent sys- tems   .the abundance of archaeal mgi in these sediments togeth- er with their common adaptation to the cooler ecological niches of the hydrothermal environments suggests a slight influence of hydrothermal fluids in ls sediments.

these differences together with the high cu fe zn and ba levels generally present in sediments from active hydrother- mal areas  may be reflected in the composition of the microbial communities at the three vent sites.with this work we aimed at studying the vent microbial communities associated with the geographically distinct hy- drothermal sediments retrieved from these three sites and at evaluating the stratification of the microbes in the first 10 cm depth traceable in the environmental dna sequence informa- tion.

the first assignment is predictably related to the pres- ence of bathymodiolus azoricus mussels at this site the second otu clustered with a major group of sea snails and primitive gastropod molluscs previously identified in mg sediments .lucky strike associated microbial communitieslucky strike sediment microbial communities exhibited the highest bacterial diversity represented by an average of 702 different otus across all ls samples table s2.

the high fe and co contents together with the acido- philic thermophilic and methanogenic diversity detected in rb samples suggest that the analysed sediments have a hy- drothermal origin and might have been influenced by moder- ately high-temperature hydrothermalism.conclusionthis study reports the dominant microbial diversity associated with deep-sea hydrothermal sediment samples from three neighbouring mar vent fields the menez gwen lucky strike and rainbow sites.

however the community structure evalu- ated across depth splitting the first 10 cm of sediment surface into three layers 0-3 3-5 and 5-10 cm thickness did not differ significantly.to our knowledge this is the first comparative survey of microbial communities associated with sediments from these three deep-sea vent fields and the first to address the microbial composition along the sediment layers.

except for the archaeal diversity in mg group of samples sobs--archaea mg p  0.004 there were no significant differences between samples from different depths within sediments from the same site.bacterial and archaeal otus showed consistent evenness estimates species distribution within the subsample groups in the three locations sampled table .

the significance of the results was obtained with the forward selection function in r and confirmed with a permutation test for rda under reduced model with 999 permutationsmarine group i mostly in ls samples and in rb superficial sediments rb03 and sulfurovum sulfurimonas and two unassigned archaeal otus in mg samples was illustrated.

members of these taxa were formerly reported in microbial surveys from rainbow sediments   likely holding strictly anaerobic and sulphate-reducing metabolisms and found to play an important role in sulphur cycling in the deep-sea bed   .the actinobacteria ocs155 marine group belonging to the acidimicrobiales order was highly represented in rb field samples figs.

did cluster the samples according to mg ls and rb sampling site except for the superficial sediment layer of rainbow samples rb03 which clustered with ls group of samples.

as such the community composition was analysed by sampling site.menez gwen associated microbial communitiesmenez gwen sediment microbial communities presented the lowest diversity of both bacterial and archaeal domains table .the most abundant otu within the bacterial community across all samples was sulfurovum an epsilonproteobacterium so far discovered only in association with hydrothermal vent habitats.

sampling sites location are noted with red dots and correspond to the sampling corers retrieved during the biobaz cruise in august 2013hand mg sediments were collected approximately at 4 m from an active vent where the sediment cover was suitable for coring.a detailed description of the study sites and vent field char- acteristics is outlined in supplementary file 1.sample collectionthe surface hydrothermal sediments were retrieved with a blade corer device at the three vent sites.

s1 a specialised host bearing sulphur-oxidising and methanotrophic endosymbionts within their gill bacteriocytes   .members of the desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae families were the representatives of deltaproteobacteria class in mg sediments presumably sulphate-reducing bacteria andpreviously reported in hydrothermal sediments   .

'alpha' 'beta' or 'b' 'delta' 'gamma' and 'epsilon' correspond to the related proteobacterial classescaldisericum genera in mg sediments potentially carrying a thermophilic lifestyle has been previously reported in other hydrothermal habitats   and may point to a warm hy- drothermal influence throughout the sediments at mg site.mg archaeal communities were dominated by two highly abundant otus otu0 and otu3 that accounted for 31 and28 of the total archaeal community respectively and could not be classified into any known archaeal phylum figs.

sunburst charts show thephylum-class distribution for taxonomically assigned sequences that occurred more than 1 of total reads in each sitedetected in mg sediments suggests that warm diffuse dis- charges of hydrothermal fluids might circulate through the sediments in mg. this may promote the colonisation of the area by particularly adapted microbes.there were few rrna sequences from eukaryote or- ganisms detected in all the sediment subsamples tables s1 and s2.

metal content was high at ls sediments with the highest ba levels across all the analysed sediments.
