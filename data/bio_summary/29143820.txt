in addition responses to sodium intake are more pronounced if individuals have high blood pressure hypertension5.previous work6 has suggested that high salt intake increases the number and activity of immune cells called t lymphocytes especially a pro-inflammatory subset called th17 cells.

on page 585 wilck et al.2 draw connections between dietary salt microorganisms in the gut immune responses and blood pressure.processed foods and western diets are packed with salt.

wilck et al.2 have demonstrated in mice that one of these indoles prevents differentiation of immune cells called t lymphocytes into th17 cells in the gut mucosa.

the sequence matched that of the bacterium lactobacillus murinus.the researchers recovered l. murinus from mouse faeces and demonstrated in vitro that its growth was inhibited by salt concentrations equivalent to those found in the colons of mice fed an hsd.

blood-pressure con- trol in humans is inadequately understood-- debate swirls around the contribution of dietary salt in particular.

average daily sodium intake in the united states is more than 3.4 grams equivalent to 8.5 g of table salt3 despite the fact that guidelines4 recommend an intake of less than 2.3 g 5.8 g of salt.

but blood-pressure responses to salt are variableand are generally detected in fewer than half of all subjects5.

first the authors gave mice 0.3 g of salt daily which is a 15-fold increase from their normal intake.
