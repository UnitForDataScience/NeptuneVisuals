in contrast colo- nic rings isolated from gf mice receiving microbiota from ibs-c patients displayed increased sensitivity to contractile agonists while exhibiting a delayed transit time compared to mice receiving microbiota from control patients fig 7. together these data suggest that micro- biota from ibs-c patients can lead to stable alterations in colonic smooth muscle cells perhaps resulting from higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in these patients.our findings also show that the colonization of gf mice with pic-cecal and ibs-c fecal microbiota decreases gi transit time compared to mice receiving control cecal microbiota suggesting that the microbiota even 4 weeks after colonization have residual effects on gut motility.

these data show that the microbiota from pic recipients in combination with differences in bacterial community abundance have dis- tinct functional properties that affect on transit time.microbiota transfer of fecal microbiota from a constipation-predominant ibs patient into gf mice recapitulates slow gi transit and increased contractile responses to carbachol and kclto determine whether slow transit is recapitulated with microbiota from ibs-c we colonized gf mice with fecalcontents from an ibs-c patient and an agegender-matched control subject.

similar to pic microbiota recipients ibs-c microbiota recipients exhibited slower transit time but no decrease in stool output body weight or food intake compared to controls.16s rrna marker gene analysis of microbial communi- ties of mice that had been colonized by ibs-c and control microbiota showed no significant differences in a-diver- sity but significant differences in b-diversity unweighted p  0.01 and weighted p  0.01 unifrac distances fig.

in our study two models of constipation were used where germ-free mice were colonized with either stool from specific patho- gen-free spf mice with pharmacologically-induced con- stipation pic or from fecal microbiota from a patient with ibs-c. because the type of diet can cause initial vari- ability in gi transit time both of the groups transplan- tated with either pic or ibs-c microbiota were fed identical diets.materials and methodsanimalsc57bl6 female and male spf mice were bred and housed in the animal care facility at the university of chicago.

however gf mice receiving microbiota from loperamide-treated mice exhibited slower gi transit time as compared to gf mice receiving microbiota fromuntreated spf mice suggesting that constipation leads to selection for certain types of gut microbes that impair gi motility.

the lack of a detectable dif- ference in the contractility of isolated colonic rings iso- lated from mice that received microbiota from control or pic would argue that the microbiota have not resulted in alterations in the intrinsic contractile machinery of colo- nic smooth muscle cells.

recent studies suggest a role for gut microbiota in constipation associ- ated with ibs chey et al.

for example methane excretion has been reported to be significantly higher from the gut microbiota of patients with consti- pation-predominant ibs compared to nonconstipated subjects while other studies have been unable to confirm these associations higgins and johanson 2004 suply et al.

2015. other studies have shown that fecal microbiota from constipated patients produce increased sulfides and hydrogen but less butyrate com- pared to healthy subjects chassard et al.

2012. soluble fiber consumption is associated with a significant improvement of constipation an effect attributed to increased fermentation and production of short-chain fatty acids scfa quigley 2011.there is emerging evidence suggesting that disruption of the bidirectional interplay between gi motility and the gut microbiota contributes to the development of gi dis- eases barbara et al.

2001.in these studies we propose that the gut microbiota contributes to the development of constipation which feeds forward to promote physiological changes and rein- forces conditions that maintain gut dysbiosis - creating a chronic state that is difficult to interrupt.
