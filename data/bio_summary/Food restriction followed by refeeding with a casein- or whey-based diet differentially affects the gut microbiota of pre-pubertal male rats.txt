interestingly here again the level of lactobacillales class bacilli phylum firmicutes and clostridiales class clostridia phylum firmicutes was similar to that of the whey group and different from that of the cas p.04 and 0.057 cu compared to cas for lactobacillales and clostridiales respectively.at the family level d the cu group had a significantly greater abundance of desulfuromonodaceae p.034 and p.019 compared to cas and whey respectively order desulfuromonadales class deltaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and erysipelotri- chaceae pb.0001 compared to cas and whey order erysipelotrichales class erysipelotrichia phylum firmicutes and a lower level of lachnospiraceae p.008 compared to cas ns compared to whey order clostridiales class clostridia phylum firmicutes and bacter- oidaceae p.005 and 0.0003 compared to cas and whey respective- ly order bacteroidales class bacteroidia phylum bacteroidetes.detailed comparison of the gut microbiota composition at t2 between the cas and whey groups yielded no significant differences at the phylum level supp fig.

clostridia and bacilli both of the phylum firmicutes were similar to the level of the whey group and significantly different from the cas group p.07 and 0.064 for clostridia and bacilli respectively ns compared to whey.at the order level c there was a greater level of desulfuromonadales p.041 and 0.022 compared to cas and whey respectively class deltaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and erysipelotrichales pb.0001 for both cas and whey class erysipelo- trichia phylum firmicutes in the cu group and a lower level of burkholderiales p.029 compared to whey ns compared to cas class betaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and bacteroidalesfig.

the class ml615j28 phylum tenericutes was present only in the res group albeit in very low abundance 0.1 of the sample.the res group had a relatively greater abundance of the orders bacillales fc6.34 p.03 class bacilli phylum firmicutes bacter- oidales fc2.21 p.01 class bacteroidia phylum bacteroidetes phylum burkholderiales fc5.90 p.03 class betaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria cytophagales fc3.13 p.01 class cyto- phagia phylum bacteroidetes and sphingobacteriales fc6.75 p.01 class sphingobacteria phylum bacteroidetes ef.

six orders were present in all samples e clostridiales 32-7.1 class clostridia lactobacillales 30-12.0 class bacilli erysipelotrichales 20- 18.6 class erysipelotrichia all are phylum firmicutes bacteroi-dales 15-11.9 class bacteroidia and cytophagales 1-1 class cytophagia of the phylum bacteroidetes and desulfuromonadales 1-1.0 class deltaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria.gut microbiota changes during the course of the experimentto evaluate the stability of the microbiota population in our study groups we compared the data between t2 to t1.

at that point the res group was further divided into three subgroups one was kept on the restricted diet res and the others were given free access to either normal chow catch-up group cu or milk-protein-based chow in which the only protein included was casein td.120604 casein diet group cas or whey td.120605 whey diet group whey.

the abundance of e1 significantly increased from t1 to t2 in both the cas and whey groups fc3.85 pb.01 and fc2.75 p.01 respectively the abundance of e2 tended to decrease in the whey group fc-3.46 p.07 with no change in the cas group and the abundance of e3 significantly decreased in the whey group fc-2.87 p.04 and tended to increase in the cas group fc3.39 p.08.fig.

numbers indicate percentage of microbiota population.on anova comparing the milk protein-specific diet groups with the others the abundance of e1 was significantly higher in the cas and whey groups than in the al group fc3.85 p.007 and fc4.15 p.003 respectively and the cu group fc2.66 p.02 and fc 2.86 p.007 respectively and the abundance of e2 was lower in the cas and whey groups than in the al group fc-2.83 p.06 and fc-4.33 p.02 respectively and res group fc-3.81 p.001 and fc-5.81 pb.0001 respectively.

at the family level of the 107 families that were analyzed increases were noted at t2 in the res group relative to the al group h compared to g in the abundance of alcaligenaceae fc5.77 p.03 order burkholderiales class betaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and erysipelotrichaceae fc87.26 p.06 order erysipelotrichales class erysipelotrichia phylum firmicutes phylum.gut microbiota after refeeding by type of dietin this part of the analysis we profiled the changes in the gut microbiota in each refed group from t1 to t2.

the cas group showed a significant increase in the abundance of clostridiales fc1.6 p.020 class clostridia phylum firmicutes bacteroidales fc2.8 p.003 class bacteroi- detes phylum bacteroidetes and burkholderiales fc4.6 p.020 class betaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and a reduced abundance of lactobacillales fc-4.9 p.002 class bacilli phylum firmicutes erysipelotrichales fc-48.8 p.002 class erysipelo- trichia phylum firmicutes phylum and coriobacteriales fc-5.0 p.02 class actinobacteria phylum actinobacteria supp fig.

the whey group showed a significant reduction in the abundance of erysipelotrichales fc-33 p.01 class erysipelo- trichia phylum firmicutes cytophagales fc-2.4 p.024 class cytophagia phylum bacteroidetes flavobacteriales fc-3.9 p.02 class flavobacteria phylum bacteroidetes and desulfuromona-dales fc-23.5 p.015 class deltaproteobacteria phylum pro- teobacteria and a tendency toward a decrease in lactobacillales fc-1.5 p.053 class bacilli phylum firmicutes.

at the class level b the cu group had a significantly greater abundance of deltaproteobacteria p.028 and 0.017 com- pared to cas and whey respectively phylum proteobacteria and erysipelotrichia pb.0001 compared to both cas and whey phylum firmicutes while the level of betaproteobacteria p.046 compared to whey and ns compared to cas phylum proteobacteria andbacteroidia p.03 and 0.023 compared to cas and whey respec- tively phylum bacteroidetes was lower than the cas and whey.

4d the whey group had a significantly greater abundance of lactobacillaceae fc4.2 p.04 order lactobacillales class bacilli phylum firmicutes and the cas group had a significantlygreater abundance of streptococcaceae fc3 p.01 order lacto- bacillales class bacilli phylum firmicutes and lachnospiraceae fc 1.8 p.02 order clostridiales class clostridia phylum firmicutes supp fig.

interestingly the order rf39 class mollicutes phylum tenericutes and the family desulfovibrionaceae order desulfovi- brionales class deltaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria were observed only in the cas group although at very low levels 0.03 and 0.03 respectively.association of gut microbial enterotype with food restriction and refeedingwe next investigated the association between the gut microbiota enterotypes described by arumugam and colleagues  with food restriction and refeeding normal chow casein diet whey diet.
