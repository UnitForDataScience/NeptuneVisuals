investigated the impact of high concentrations of oleate unsaturated LCFA and palmitate saturated LCFA on pure cultures of acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens finding that saturated LCFA had greater inhibitory effects than unsaturated LCFA on methanogens and that the inhibition mechanism was through damaged membrane integrity.

Researchers are hopeful im- provements in chemistry and bioinformatics associated with the device will improve sequencing accuracy .The platform has been used to characterize mixed microbial com- munities based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing in a mock microbial community with low diversity  a mixed community from produced hydraulic fracturing wastewater   and the microbial community in a mouse gut .

Further unlike targeting the 16S rRNA gene sequence data from metagenomics can be used to infer functional potential of a microbial community without relying on taxonomy-based physiological char- acteristics .Recent studies have applied metagenomics to study the microbial community response to inhibitors such as ammonia   LCFA   temperature  and VFA .

Although this method has been used to quantify methanogens in environmental samples  more studies should apply the method in AD systems and explore techniques to reduce the detection limit.Omics studiesMetagenomicsMetagenomics shotgun sequencing of environmental DNA is an approach to characterizing structure and metabolic potential that can provide greater information than amplicon gene sequencing approaches discussed in the preceding section.

used MinION sequencing in conjunction with Illu- mina sequencing and a molecular tagging method to reduce error as- sociated with the MinION sequencer when sequencing full-length 16S rRNA genes and SSU rRNA fragments collected from AD and several other complex environments.

used membrane inlet quad- rupole mass spectrometry MIMS and isotope labeled acetate to monitor the relative activity of acetoclastic and SAO pathways in near- real-time in a bench-scale reactor.Naturally occurring isotope fractionation in biogas has also been used to estimate the relative importance of acetoclastic methanogenic and SAO pathways however it has typically been used in natural en- vironments where the addition of large quantities of isotope labeled substrates is not practical.

Studying substrate utilization patterns and community dy- namics under stressed and inhibited conditions provides information that can be used to develop more robust and reliable AD systems.Stable isotope and radio isotope labeled compounds are used to link specific substrates with degradation products.

Relative abundance information can also be misleading when the overall size of the community is changing  though quantitative sequencing methods are beginning to be used .
