Analysis of the base frequencies of codon third positions of the viral ORFs showed significant differences between TLV1 and OV1 and a greater degree between these and the nuclear ge- nome of Leptomonas pyrrhocoris Table S5.Thus we conclude that RNAs O1-O6 comprise a previ- ously undescribed virus Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1 LeppyrOV1.

Leptomo- nas pyrrhocoris was a hotbed for viral discovery carrying a virus Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1 with a highly divergent RNA- dependent RNA polymerase missed by conventional BLAST searches an emergent clade of tombus-like viruses and an example of viral endogenization.

Most RNA segments were sequenced and the sequences of those encoding viral RNA- dependent RNA polymerase RDRP were used to assign affil- iations to the known viral families.RNA Viruses of Leptomonas pyrrhocoris.

On the reconstructed phylogenetic tree all these viruses from metatranscriptomes intermingled with the trypanosomatid LBVs with high statistical support Fig.

Consistent with the latter a significant albeit imperfect level of phylogenetic congruency can be seen between trypanosomatid LBVs and nu- clear genome phylogenies Fig.

However the possibility of multiple acquisitions of LBVs by trypanosomatids from insects or other trypanosomatids cannot be formally excluded given that trypanosomatid LBV1s bear hallmarks of infectious bunyaviruses and reports of mixed trypanosomatid infections 75-78.

Last for several trypanosomatid LBV1s we visu- alized the presence of enveloped virions bearing surface proteins Fig.

These fas- cinating questions will be addressed in future studies.Phylogenetic relationships of relevant trypanosomatid taxa per- mit a broader view of the origins and evolution of their viruses Fig.

Secondly nar- naviruses LBV1s and LRV12s appear to be distributed over the trypanosomatid phylogenetic tree in a patchy manner with many seemingly virus-free lineages interspersed with ones bearing diverse viruses Fig.

It is thus possible that RNAi plays only a weak role in the evolutionary distribution of trypanosomatid viruses.Several studies have established a role for trypanosomatid viruses in the vertebrate host 6 27-29 40 98.
