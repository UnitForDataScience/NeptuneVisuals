Analysis of the base frequencies of codon third positions of the viral ORFs showed significant differences between TLV1 and OV1 and a greater degree between these and the nuclear ge- nome of Leptomonas pyrrhocoris Table S5.Thus we conclude that RNAs O1-O6 comprise a previ- ously undescribed virus Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1 LeppyrOV1.

Leptomo- nas pyrrhocoris was a hotbed for viral discovery carrying a virus Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1 with a highly divergent RNA- dependent RNA polymerase missed by conventional BLAST searches an emergent clade of tombus-like viruses and an example of viral endogenization.

Most RNA segments were sequenced and the sequences of those encoding viral RNA- dependent RNA polymerase RDRP were used to assign affil- iations to the known viral families.RNA Viruses of Leptomonas pyrrhocoris.

However the possibility of multiple acquisitions of LBVs by trypanosomatids from insects or other trypanosomatids cannot be formally excluded given that trypanosomatid LBV1s bear hallmarks of infectious bunyaviruses and reports of mixed trypanosomatid infections 75-78.

It is thus possible that RNAi plays only a weak role in the evolutionary distribution of trypanosomatid viruses.Several studies have established a role for trypanosomatid viruses in the vertebrate host 6 27-29 40 98.

A deep-branching clade of trypanosomatid narnavi- ruses was found notable as Leptomonas seymouri bearing Narna- like virus 1 LepseyNLV1 have been reported in cultures recovered from patients with visceral leishmaniasis.

Indeed a number of telomere-associated transposable element TATE and spliced leader-associated SLAC retroelements have been identified in the Leptomonas pyrrhocoris genome 53 including oneAkb 6543.532.52BDRNA-T1 RNA-T2Tombus-like virusesLeppyrTLV1 RNA-T1 3472 bp Stem loop5'ORF1ORF2 RDRP3'850 aa -1 frameshift 515 aaLeppyrTLV1 RNA-T2 2055 bp5'3'455 aaORF1CVKAHFLPKSG...guuaaagcgcauuuuuuaccaagagcggat-SAFFTKER ...RDRP ORF -1 frameKey for hostsPlantsCrustaceansMyriapodsMolluscsInsects except beesBeesTicksNematodesVertebrates Leech OomycetesFungi Trypanosomatids  UnknownMetatranscriptomic sequences containing trypanosomatid readsFig.
