importantly because oral no production is dependent on oral nitrate-reducing bacteria these observationssuggest that the link between oral health issues such as chronic periodontitis and cardiovascular disease may be due in part to decreased abundance of nitrate reducers and concurrent increase of pathogenic bacterial species in the oral cavity.

these new discoveries in the oral bacterial microbiome suggest that an effective strategy to pro- mote therapeutically no production and overcome conditions of no insufficiency may not solely be to target nos but rather to focus on understanding specific oral bacterial com- munities and the optimal conditions for efficient oral nitrate reduction.
