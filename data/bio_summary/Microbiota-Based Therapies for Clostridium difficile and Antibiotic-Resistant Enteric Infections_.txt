In this review we summarize recent work on three groups of bacterial pathogens that are readily suppressed by a complex antibiotic-naive microbiota but that can thrive and cause disease in pa- tients with a disrupted microbiota Clostridium difficile vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus VRE and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

For example when Stiefel and colleagues colonized mice with a b-lactamase- producing strain of B. thetaiotaomicron and administered a dose of ceftriaxone they found that the presence of the antibiotic-inactivating enzyme in the gut allowed the microbiota to recover and prevent overgrowth with VRE or C. difficile 143.Specific Members of the Microbiota Confer Protection Against Specific Intestinal PathogensMammalian hosts benefit from the complex diverse microbiota composed of a broad array of anaerobic bacterial species because they provide resistance to a wide range of pathogens 14 66.

It is likely that the levels of colonization resistance conferred by the obligate anaerobic bacterial species that constitute the intestinal microbiota will be difficult to achieve with the more palatable oxygen-tolerant probiotic bacterial species currently available to the public.An indirect method to help boost commensal species and restore colonization resistance to infections is with prebiotics orally ingested products such as complex carbohydrates and fibers that can affect microbiota composition by favoring the expansion of potentially desirable com- mensal species.

Species and genus level resolution analysis of gut microbiota in Clostridium difficile patients following fecal microbiota transplantation.

The commensal microbiota comprising microbes that colonize the mam- malian gastrointestinal tract can provide high levels of resistance to in- fection and the contributions of specific bacterial species to resistance are being discovered and characterized.

In many settings the microbiota contributes to health and disease resistance whereas in other circumstances it exacerbates inflammatory disease pathogenesis.

The microbiota contains a di- verse array of bacteria viruses fungi and protozoans but the bacterial component has been most extensively investigated.

Although diet and other environmental factors can influence the composition of the human microbiota administration of antibiotics has the most dramatic and long-term impact in some cases leading to permanent loss of many bacterial taxa 38 39.

In addition we review strategies to remediate antibiotic-induced damage to the microbiota and to enhance resistance to these infections 19.ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT COMPROMISES THE MICROBIOTA AND INCREASES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONSClostridium difficile Emergence and Relationship to Antibiotic TherapyClostridium difficile is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that causes antibiotic-associated diar- rhea and colitis and results in the majority of gastroenteritis-associated deaths in the United States 64.
