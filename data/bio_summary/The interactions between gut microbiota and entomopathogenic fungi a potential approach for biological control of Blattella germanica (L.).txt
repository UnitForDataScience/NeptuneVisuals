to evaluate whether the gut bacteria participate in antifungal activity and to determine their role in host protection the interactions between gut bacteria and m. anisopliae and the diversity of gut microbiota in cockroaches were studied.results an oral feeding test showed that the mortality of conventional cockroaches was significantly lower than that of germ-free cockroaches both gut homogenates and aqueous fecal extracts showed antifungal activity but the samples from germ-free cockroaches did not.

the time to death of con- ventional cockroaches was extended with a mortality rate of 16.67 - 0.79.anti-entomopathogenic fungi assay of gut homogenates and aqueous fecal extractsgut homogenates and aqueous fecal extracts of conventional cockroaches inhibited m. anisopliae whereas those of germ-free80706050conventional cockroaches 40germ-free cockroaches3020100110100100010000concentration of conidia x 105 cfu ml-1figure 1. the mortality of conventional and germ-free cockroaches infected with m. anisopliae through oral feeding only at 15 days post-inoculation.

sobs represents observed number of species.bacteroidetes in the foregut midgut and hindgut was 13.97 7.33 and 50.4 respectively.detected otus were distributed among 212 different bacterial genera and those of the foregut midgut and hindgut were com- posed of 186 173 and 137 different bacterial genera respectively fig.

there was a significantly lower level of weissella 0.14 versus 14.22 p  0.05 in the hindgut compared with the foregut and a significantly higher level of christensenellaceaer-7group 3.48 versus 0.36 p  0.05 in the hindgut compared with the midgut fig.

the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 c in sterile tubes for further use.24susceptibility of conventional and germ-free cockroaches to m. anisopliae applied through oral feeding conventional and germ-free cockroaches were each divided into five groups of 20 cockroaches and the groups were treated with 1 x 105 1 x 106 1 x 107 1 x 108 and 1 x 109 cfu ml-1 of m. aniso- pliae conidial suspension respectively.

the composition of the microbiota of the hindgut was vastly different from those of the foregut and midgut higher diversity and abundance of bacteroides and pseudomonas were found in the hindgut.conclusion the gut microbiota of german cockroaches may play a critical role in protecting cockroaches from fungal invasion and colonization.

bacterial strains withanti-entomopathogenic activity were subsequently identified.screening for siderophores and siderophore detection the detection of siderophores was performed using modified chrome azurol s cas agar plates.30 the siderophores secreted by the bacteria can chelate iron from the medium resulting in a color shift from blue to orange.fifty bacterial colonies from a pure culture were inoculated into 2 ml of liquid luria - bertani lb medium and kept overnight at 37 c in a shaker at 220 rpm and then incubated on cas agarplates at 37 c for 24 h. siderophore production was detectedbased on the formation of orange halos surrounding the bacterial colonies on cas agar.

the experiments for each of the bacterial isolates were performed in triplicate and confirmed by testing sterile distilled water as a negative control.31molecular analysistwenty-two bacterial strains with antifungal activity or siderophore-producing ability were revived on pda medium.the bacterial genomic dna was prepared based on the ausubel method.32 for amplification of 16s rdna genes uni- versal primers 27f-agagtttgatcctggctcag and 1492r-tacg gctaccttgttacgactt33 were used bgi sequencing technology co. ltd beijing china was commissioned to carry out synthesis of primers and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction pcr prod- ucts.

using a one-way anova for comparison we found that the diversity indexes were significantly different p  0.05 but the richness indexes were not significantly different p  0.05 between the foregut sf midgut sm and hindgut sh samples table 2.good's coverage estimations revealed that 99 of the species were obtained in the nine samples which demonstrated that all samples reached sufficient sampling depth table 2. the rarefac- tion curves tended to approach the saturation plateau and indi- cated a large variation in the total number of otus in different samples whereas the otu density was greater in the upper layer than in the lower parts.
