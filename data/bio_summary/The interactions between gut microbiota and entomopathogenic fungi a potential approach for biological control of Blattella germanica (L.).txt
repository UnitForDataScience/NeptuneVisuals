To evaluate whether the gut bacteria participate in antifungal activity and to determine their role in host protection the interactions between gut bacteria and M. anisopliae and the diversity of gut microbiota in cockroaches were studied.RESULTS An oral feeding test showed that the mortality of conventional cockroaches was significantly lower than that of germ-free cockroaches both gut homogenates and aqueous fecal extracts showed antifungal activity but the samples from germ-free cockroaches did not.

There was a significantly lower level of Weissella 0.14 versus 14.22 P  0.05 in the hindgut compared with the foregut and a significantly higher level of ChristensenellaceaeR-7group 3.48 versus 0.36 P  0.05 in the hindgut compared with the midgut Fig.

Sobs represents observed number of species.Bacteroidetes in the foregut midgut and hindgut was 13.97 7.33 and 50.4 respectively.Detected OTUs were distributed among 212 different bacterial genera and those of the foregut midgut and hindgut were com- posed of 186 173 and 137 different bacterial genera respectively Fig.

The supernatant was collected and stored at -80 C in sterile tubes for further use.24Susceptibility of conventional and germ-free cockroaches to M. anisopliae applied through oral feeding Conventional and germ-free cockroaches were each divided into five groups of 20 cockroaches and the groups were treated with 1 x 105 1 x 106 1 x 107 1 x 108 and 1 x 109 cfu ml-1 of M. aniso- pliae conidial suspension respectively.

The time to death of con- ventional cockroaches was extended with a mortality rate of 16.67 - 0.79.Anti-entomopathogenic fungi assay of gut homogenates and aqueous fecal extractsGut homogenates and aqueous fecal extracts of conventional cockroaches inhibited M. anisopliae whereas those of germ-free80706050Conventional cockroaches 40Germ-free cockroaches3020100110100100010000Concentration of conidia x 105 cfu mL-1Figure 1.

The composition of the microbiota of the hindgut was vastly different from those of the foregut and midgut higher diversity and abundance of Bacteroides and Pseudomonas were found in the hindgut.CONCLUSION The gut microbiota of German cockroaches may play a critical role in protecting cockroaches from fungal invasion and colonization.
