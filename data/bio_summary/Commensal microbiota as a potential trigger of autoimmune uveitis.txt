We propose that gut commensal microbiota play a role as a trigger of autoimmune uveitis and discuss potential therapeutic approaches for uveitis with our current knowledge.Human microbiome and autoimmune diseasesHuman body is inhabited by a diverse microbial community and the dynamic crosstalk between the host and the micro- biota is important in maintaining homeostasis in health and disease .

Although a role for gut commensals in animal models of autoimmune uveitis has been strongly supported it is not known to what extent dysbiosis in the gut might affect human uveitic disease.It is important to identify the putative microbial mimics in the commensal flora not only from mice but also in human microbiota.

Using a spontaneous autoimmune uveitis model developed in our laboratory we demonstrated that retina-specific T cells receive an activation signal in the gut from commensal microbiota-derived antigens and trigger autoimmune uveitis .

Importantly new unpublished data presented at conferences are beginning to support the notion that human microbiota can promote development of pathology in animal models of the corre- sponding disease validating the critical role of these models to study effects of the human microbiome.As the first gut microbiome study in human uveitis our preliminary data from a small cohort of chronic autoim- mune posterior segment uveitis patients whose disease was controlled by treatment indicated a changed microbial composition between uveitis and healthy controls.

A larger study to characterize the gut microbiome in different types of uveitis is currently underway.Animal studies on microbiota and uveitisA causal role for the microbiome in autoimmune disease in animal models is now well established.

These results also highlight the notion that uveitis is a heterogeneous disease with potentially different environmental immunologic and genetic influencing factors.Thus alterations of commensal communities may contribute to disease by a combination of adaptive and innate pathways including microbial mimics of autoantigens innate microbial stimuli loss of microbiota that produce 'anti-inflammatory' metabolites such as short chain fatty acids  andor by emergence of pathogenic bacteria which may disrupt intestinal barrier and stimulate production of inflammatory mediators.Future directions and potential therapeutic strategiesThe HMP and European Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract project characterized the composition diver- sity and functionality of the healthy gut microbiome and clinical studies have shown associations of taxonomic abun- dance with some clinical phenotypes.
