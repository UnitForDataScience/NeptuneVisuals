Data and the scientific published literature on the effects of antimicrobial residues on the human intestinal microbiome are reviewed by national regulatory authorities as part of the human food safety evaluation of veterinary antimicrobial agents used in food-producing animals.

Although the human intestinal microbiota is generally stable within healthy individuals over time a variety of external pertur- bations and lifestyle changes such as type of dietary intake and human medicinal drugs exposure can alter the microbiota composition and functions in the intestine .

Among human medicinal drugs antibiotic use is one of the major influences which can perturb the composition of the microbiota e. Antibiotics at therapeutic dosage levels have a profound effect on the microbiota and their overuse is linked with an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens .The use of antibiotics in food-producing animals may result in more than negligible residue concentrations of antimicrobial drugs in edible tissues e. Regulatory authorities such as the Eu- ropean Medicines Agency EMA the United States- Food and Drug Administration US FDA and international committees like the Joint Food and Agriculture OrganizationWorld Health Organiza- tion FAOWHO Expert Committee on Food Additives JECFA establish safe levels of antibiotic exposure by determining accept- able daily intakes ADI for human consumption.

Recently Cerniglia and collab- orators provided an update discussion on the current assessment of the safety of veterinary antimicrobial drug residues in food with regard to their impact on the human intestinal microbiome dis- cussing the availability of new information .Tetracycline a member of a family of broad-spectrum polyke-tide antimicrobials is used in both human and veterinary medicine.

The codified ADIfor the United States is 25 mgkg bwday .The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of low residue concentrations of tetracycline on the human intestinal microbiome through the analysis of bacterial community compo- sition and quantification of resistance genes in human fecal sam- ples using an in vitro batch culture system.

Metagenomic approaches using high-throughput sequencing have proved to be powerful tools in the analysis of the microbiome in the human gut e and have been used to analyze the impact of antibiotics on the human intestinal micro- biota .

The genus Bacteroides including anaerobic gram-negative non-spore forming and rod-shaped bacteria are one of the dominant bacte- rial groups in the human colon  and they are involved in many important metabolic activities in the human colon such as hy- drolysis of polysaccharides carbohydrate fermentation andutilization of nitrogenous substances .

The methodological approaches combining high- throughput sequencing qRT-PCR and bioinformatic analysis will be useful tools in the next phase of screening more human fecalspecimens for the effects of low residue concentrations of antibi- otics including tetracycline on the human intestinal microbiome.
