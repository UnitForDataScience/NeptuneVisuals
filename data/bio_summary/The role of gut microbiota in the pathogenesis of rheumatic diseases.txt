in conclusion patients with early ra mani- fested increased production and community structure changes of fecal lactobacilli and the changes of the lactobacillus community in quantity and species may be a factor in the development and outcome of ra progression .although these data suggest intestinal microbiota play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ra there has been no fully adequate longitudinal study on the exact relationship between gut microbiota and the development of ra.

eur j immunol 461162-1167liu x zhang j zou q zhong b wang h mou f et al 2016 lactobacillus salivarius isolated from patients with rheumatoid ar- thritis suppresses collagen-induced arthritis and increases treg fre- quency in mice.

in general microbial fragments and products scfas mainly entered lamina propria and binded to specific receptors on the surface of antigen-presenting cells triggering signals to instruct the differentiation of peripheral immune cells including th cells and treg cells.

it has been suggested that arthritis was attenuated in k bxn mice when they were housed under gf conditions  while transplantation of microbiota from cia- susceptible mice into gf mice aggravated arthritis sever- ity .

compared with cia-resistant mice desulfovibrionaceae and lachnospiraceae were significantly decreased in abundance in cia-susceptible mice before disease onset while lactobacillus was dramatically increased in abun- dance after collagen-mediated induction in cia- susceptible mice.

in contrast scfas aggravated the disease severity of arthritis induced by the transfer of se- rum obtained from krn tcr-transgenic mice crossed with nod kbxn mice which represented the effector phase of inflammation in ra .

recently il- 1 receptor antagonist knock-out mice have been used as ra models since they displayed t cell-mediated arthritis under a specific-pathogen-free condition in response to excessive il-1 signaling while stayed disease-free status when the mice were housed under gf condition.

these data are consistent with the results mentioned above which suggested a causal relationship between gut microbiota and cia-susceptible mice and gut microbiota profoundly affect the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses during collagen-mediated induction.human studies showed that patients with ra displayed significant modification of the intestinal flora and decreased gut microbial diversity in comparison to healthy controls  .

in comparison with patients with fibromyal- gia patients with ra had significantly less bifidobacteria and bacteria of the bacteroides-porphyromonas-prevotella group bacteroides fragilis subgroup and the eubacterium rectale- clostridium coccoides group .

in addition a recent retrospective study suggested that breastfeeding induced a protective effect on the occurrence of as by influencing the development of gut microbiome in infants which is based on the data that patients with as were less often breast-fed than healthy controls .sjogren's syndromess is a systemic chronic autoimmune disorder typically char- acterized by lymphocyte infiltration with activated cd4 t cells and b cells in exocrine glands and other parenchymal organs .

therefore further work is necessary to understand the precise mechanism of intestinal microbiota in the development of rheumatic diseases to provide new insights for the therapy and prevention of patients with rheumatic diseases.compliance with ethical standards disclosures none.referencesqin j li r raes j arumugam m burgdorf ks manichanh c et al 2010 a human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing.
