In conclusion patients with early RA mani- fested increased production and community structure changes of fecal lactobacilli and the changes of the Lactobacillus community in quantity and species may be a factor in the development and outcome of RA progression .Although these data suggest intestinal microbiota play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA there has been no fully adequate longitudinal study on the exact relationship between gut microbiota and the development of RA.

When these molecules binded to specific receptors on the surface of antigen presenting cells pro- inflammatory T cells including T helper 1 Th1 and T help- er 17 Th17 cells were activated to induce the differentia- tion of B cells into autoantibody-producing plasma cells.

These data are consistent with the results mentioned above which suggested a causal relationship between gut microbiota and CIA-susceptible mice and gut microbiota profoundly affect the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses during collagen-mediated induction.Human studies showed that patients with RA displayed significant modification of the intestinal flora and decreased gut microbial diversity in comparison to healthy controls  .

In general microbial fragments and products SCFAs mainly entered lamina propria and binded to specific receptors on the surface of antigen-presenting cells triggering signals to instruct the differentiation of peripheral immune cells including Th cells and Treg cells.

Therefore further work is necessary to understand the precise mechanism of intestinal microbiota in the development of rheumatic diseases to provide new insights for the therapy and prevention of patients with rheumatic diseases.Compliance with ethical standards Disclosures None.ReferencesQin J Li R Raes J Arumugam M Burgdorf KS Manichanh C et al 2010 A human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing.

It has been suggested that arthritis was attenuated in K BxN mice when they were housed under GF conditions  while transplantation of microbiota from CIA- susceptible mice into GF mice aggravated arthritis sever- ity .
