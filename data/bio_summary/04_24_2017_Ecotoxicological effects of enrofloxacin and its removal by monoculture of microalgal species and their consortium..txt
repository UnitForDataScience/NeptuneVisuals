The microbial consortia systems are more resistant to changes in environmental conditions since the multi-microorganism species with distinct metabolic activities that are adapted to diverse environmental variations was found to allow the development of a robust biological system thatcan operate under different environmental stresses a.Previous studies have mainly focused on the toxicological effects of ENR on individual microalgal species  .

The column effluent was monitored at 271 nm to detect the ENR.The total removal Pt of ENR by different microalgae species and their consortium was calculated using the following equationPtdC0 - Ct x 100where C0 is the initial concentration of ENR at time zero and Ct is the concentration of ENR at time t.The ENR removal kinetics by five different microalgae species and their consortium were analyzed using a first-order reaction as followsln Ct 14 -kt th ln C0where C0 is the initial concentration of ENR at time zero Ct is the concentration of ENR at time t k is the removal rate constant d-1 and t is the removal period in days.Statistical analysisThe data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test by GraphPad Prism version 5.0 USA for Windows.

Most earlier studies have focused on the removal of EOCs using individual microalgal species the interactions of different microalgal species with pollutants in nat- ural habitats have been neglected.

The ecotoxicity and removal of ENR by five individual microalgae species and their consortium were studied to correlate the behavior and interaction of ENR in natural systems.

The in- dividual microalgal species Scenedesmus obliquus Chlamydomonas mexicana Chlorella vulgaris Our- ococcus multisporus Micractinium resseri and their consortium could withstand high doses of ENR  l1 mg L-1.

The calculated 96 h EC50 of ENR for individual microalgae species and microalgae consortium was 9.6e15.0 mg ENR L-1.

The individual microalgae species and microalgae consortium removed 18e26 ENR at day 11.

The removal efficiency and kinetics of ENR by five microalgae species and their consortium were also evaluated.Materials and methodsChemicalsEnrofloxacin  98.0 purity HPLC grade was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA and its physico-chemical properties are presented in Table S1.

The inoculum of each microalgal species was cultivatedat exponential phase was diluted using sterilized BBM to achieve an optical density OD of 1.0 at 680 nm equals to the dry cell mass concentrations C. mexicana 0.140 g L-1 S. obliquus0.278 g L-1 C. vulgaris 0.135 g L-1 O. mutisporus 0.167 g L-1M.

The cultivation conditions in the shaking incubator were described above  .Preparation of microalgae consortiumThe inoculum cultures of five individual microalgae species were diluted to achieve OD680-1.0 using sterilized BBM and then0.3 mL of each culture was added into an Erlenmeyer flask con- taining 150 mL sterilized BBM to achieve a total volume of 1.5 mL of microalgae consortium 1 VinoculumVmedia.
