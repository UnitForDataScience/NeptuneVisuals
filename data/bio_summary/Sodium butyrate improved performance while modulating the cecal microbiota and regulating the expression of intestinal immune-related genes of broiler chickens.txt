On the other hand comparing the predicted function of the cecal microbiota from broilers fed control diets and the microbiota of chick- ens fed a nutritionally reduced diet supplemented with SB only four metabolic pathways were statistically different.Pyruvate metabolism is well known in the energy process Turnbaugh et al.

These results show that SB had posi- tive effects on the productive performance of broilers fed nutritionally reduced diets partially by modulating the cecal microbiota and exerting immune-modulatory effects.Key words broiler immune system intestinal microbiota sodium butyrate2017 Poultry Science 963981-3993 INTRODUCTIONIntestinal bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids SCFA which are derived from cecal fermentation of compounds that cannot be digested by the animals such as cellulose fiber starch and sugar Guilloteau et al.

Furthermore a question remains on what effect butyrate may elicit on the cecal microbiota and what translational effects it elicits on the host.To our knowledge there is no study examining the effects of protected sources of dietary butyrate on the cecal microbiota of broiler chickens and its association with the intestinal immune system.

Chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet presented a higher percentage of sequences related to Ruminococ- caceae 11.9 in the cecal microbiota than chicken fed a control diet supplemented or not with SB 6.5 andFigure 1.

.Finally the cecal microbiota of birds fed control diet and that of birds fed nutritionally reduced diet sup- plemented with SB was compared.
