the frequency of bacterial species presenting the butyryl-coa acetate coa-transferase gene increased in the microbiota of chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet without sb supplementation and was not changed by nutrient den- sity of the diet when supplemented with sb interac- tion p  0.01. sb modulated the expression of im- mune related genes in the cecal tonsils wherein sb upregulated the expression of a20 in broilers fed con- trol diets p  0.05 and increased il-6 expression p  0.05. these results show that sb had posi- tive effects on the productive performance of broilers fed nutritionally reduced diets partially by modulating the cecal microbiota and exerting immune-modulatory effects.key words broiler immune system intestinal microbiota sodium butyrate2017 poultry science 963981-3993 introductionintestinal bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids scfa which are derived from cecal fermentation of compounds that cannot be digested by the animals such as cellulose fiber starch and sugar guilloteau et al.

the amount of ruminococcaceae observed in the cecal microbiota of birds fed a nutrition- ally reduced diet supplemented with sb did not differ statistically from the other groups 9.1. when only considering nutritional density of the diet chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet tended to present a higher percentage of sequences in the cecal microbiota related to butyrococcus p  0.06 and ruminococcaceae p 0.07. on the other hand chickens fed a control diet had a cecal microbiota enriched for sequences related to firmicutes p  0.05 and clostridiales p  0.01. the phylum firmicutes has been related to the abil- ity to harvest energy from the diet presenting higher proportion in animals with better feed efficiency ley et al.

the combination of the nutritional den- sity of the diet and the supplementation of sb affected the distribution of ruminococcaceae in the cecal micro- biota interaction of nutrient density by sb p  0.04. chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet presented a higher percentage of sequences related to ruminococ- caceae 11.9 in the cecal microbiota than chicken fed a control diet supplemented or not with sb 6.5 andfigure 1. unweighted a and weighted b unifrac cecal micro- biota visualized via principle coordinate analysis pca from 28 d broiler chickens fed control c or nutritionally reduced diet r with or without sodium butyrate sb supplementation.p  0.05 mean otu chao index shannon index and simpson index were 261 412 3.53 and 0.09 respectively.

there was a sig- nificant interaction between the nutritional density of diets and sb supplementation wherein the intestinal microbiota of chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet without supplementation of sb showed a higher fre- quency of butyryl-coa acetate coa gene compared to the treatments supplemented with sb p  0.01 figure  and was not affected by nutrient density when diets were supplemented with sb.

however when the predicted function of the microbiota of chickens fed a control diet and the predicted function of the micro- biota of chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet supple- mented with sb were compared fewer differences in the kegg pathway were observed figure b. there were 15 different predicted metabolic pathways observed be- tween the first two groups of birds which showed that the microbiota from birds fed a nutritionally reduced diet was utilizing the cecal content in a dissimilar way since the digesta profile reaching the ceca was distinct between both groups.

on the other hand comparing the predicted function of the cecal microbiota from broilers fed control diets and the microbiota of chick- ens fed a nutritionally reduced diet supplemented with sb only four metabolic pathways were statistically different.pyruvate metabolism is well known in the energy process turnbaugh et al.

furthermore a question remains on what effect butyrate may elicit on the cecal microbiota and what translational effects it elicits on the host.to our knowledge there is no study examining the effects of protected sources of dietary butyrate on the cecal microbiota of broiler chickens and its association with the intestinal immune system.
