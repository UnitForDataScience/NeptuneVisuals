Chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet presented a lower percentage of sequences related to Faecalibac- terium prausnitzii OTU69 92 P  0.04 Clostrid- ium spiroforme OTU95 96 P  0.03 Pseud- oflavonifractor capillosus OTU104 89 P  0.03 and Clostridium leptum OTU79 92 P  0.02 and more sequences related to Saccharofermentaris aceti- genes OTU91 88 P  0.03 G. thermotolerans OTU133 87 P  0.02 and Odoribacter splanch- nicus OTU185 99 P  0.0009 than chickens fed the same diet supplemented with SB.Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a butyrate-producing bacterium of species belonging to Lachnospiraceae have been related to good feed efficiency Kameyama and Itoh  which may contribute to the improved per- formance observed in birds fed a nutritionally reduced diet supplemented with SB.

On the other hand comparing the predicted function of the cecal microbiota from broilers fed control diets and the microbiota of chick- ens fed a nutritionally reduced diet supplemented with SB only four metabolic pathways were statistically different.Pyruvate metabolism is well known in the energy process Turnbaugh et al.

When only considering nutritional density of the diet chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet tended to present a higher percentage of sequences in the cecal microbiota related to Butyrococcus P  0.06 and Ruminococcaceae P 0.07.

These results show that SB had posi- tive effects on the productive performance of broilers fed nutritionally reduced diets partially by modulating the cecal microbiota and exerting immune-modulatory effects.Key words broiler immune system intestinal microbiota sodium butyrate2017 Poultry Science 963981-3993 INTRODUCTIONIntestinal bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids SCFA which are derived from cecal fermentation of compounds that cannot be digested by the animals such as cellulose fiber starch and sugar Guilloteau et al.

Furthermore a question remains on what effect butyrate may elicit on the cecal microbiota and what translational effects it elicits on the host.To our knowledge there is no study examining the effects of protected sources of dietary butyrate on the cecal microbiota of broiler chickens and its association with the intestinal immune system.
