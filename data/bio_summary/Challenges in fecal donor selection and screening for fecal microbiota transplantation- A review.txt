Notably PCR diagnostics for symptomatic CDI may result in over diagnosis compared with toxin enzyme immunoassay EIA tests though in the case of screening this is likely an acceptable bias.Off- label rectal swab PCR testing for asymptomatic car- riers has been used in at least one study.However further clinical validation of C. difficile PCR testing is urgently needed to evaluate its use for screening of asymptomatic individuals.Similarly PCR-based multiplex panels that have been developed for rapid identification of other bacterial viral and parasitic pathogens in infectious diarrhea have been developed compared with cul- ture of loosewatery stool specimens.While most donor screening recommendations suggest stool culture antigen testing and microscopic examina- tion for ova and parasites as a means of screening for asymptomatic carriage a study to validate gas- trointestinal pathogen panels for asymptomatic pathogen colonization could potentially reducecosts to stool banking programs and improve effi- ciency of screening.Using non-toxigenic C. difficile strains as a means to outcompete toxigenic strains is being tested in clini- cal trials.Validated commercial assays testing alter- native PCR targets that identify donors colonized with non-pathogenic strains of C. difficile while ruling out asymptomatic carriage of other viral bacterial and protozoal pathogens would be a helpful inclusion cri- terion for ideal stool donors.

In addition there may be future changes in FMT regula- tion including which indications require Investiga- tional New Drug IND applications oversight of donor selection screening and stool banking practi- ces.As an example of the importance of donor selection outcomes for FMT for Inflammatory Bowel Disease IBD in particular may be sensitive to donor selection and the donor stool microbiota diversity.

As more is understood about the influence of the human gut microbiota basic science and clinical trial data should be rapidly incorporated to translate benefits and limit risk to patients through updated donor and stool screening for fecal micro- biota transplantation FMT.FMT is best understood as an effective inexpensive and apparently safe method for clinical enrichment of human gut microbiota to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection RCDI.

As of September 1 2016 there are 197 clinical trials registered under the terms FMT fecal microbiota and fecal microbiota transplantation on for indica- tions as varied as primary sclerosing cholangitis non- alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH type II diabetes mel- litus irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease hepatic encephalopathy and eradication of colonization by multi-drug resistant organismsCONTACT Colleen S.

The reported 90 cure rate for RCDI treated with FMT with few reported adverse effects underscores the need for rapid and continued improvement in understanding of this treatment.While the practice of preparing human stool to treat human disease has been traced back 1700 years the benefits of FMT have only recently begun to be clarified in modern structured clinical trials.

These joint society recommendations were largely informed by the foundational recommendations of the FMT Work- group which were published in 2011.FDA guidance for FMT remains in flux but ideally their ultimate reg- ulatory decisions would standardize donor selection and screening to reduce risk without overly limiting access.Guidance from professional societies and the FDA suggest a preference for selecting stool donors who are known to the patient or providers.

HIV - human immunodeficiency virus HAV - hepatitis A virus HBV - hepatitis B virus HCV - hepatitis C virus.Off-label C. difficile toxin gene polymerase chain reaction testing is most commonly recommended although off-label antigen toxin enzyme immunoassay ortoxigenic culture are also likely appropriate.inconsistently been associated with irritable bowel syndrome IBS.However the literature on this topic is inconsistent.Screening stool for potential pathogens is a criti- cally important step in reducing risk to FMT recipients.

Risk of Clostridium difficile infection CDI is thought to be driven by loss of diversity of the gut microbiota or dysbiosis as a com- plication of antibiotic use.

And though FMT is best understood as treatment of RCDI interest in microbiota enrichment for other clinical indications is expanding.
