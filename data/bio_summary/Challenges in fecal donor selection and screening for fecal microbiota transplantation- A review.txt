notably pcr diagnostics for symptomatic cdi may result in over diagnosis compared with toxin enzyme immunoassay eia tests though in the case of screening this is likely an acceptable bias.off- label rectal swab pcr testing for asymptomatic car- riers has been used in at least one study.however further clinical validation of c. difficile pcr testing is urgently needed to evaluate its use for screening of asymptomatic individuals.similarly pcr-based multiplex panels that have been developed for rapid identification of other bacterial viral and parasitic pathogens in infectious diarrhea have been developed compared with cul- ture of loosewatery stool specimens.while most donor screening recommendations suggest stool culture antigen testing and microscopic examina- tion for ova and parasites as a means of screening for asymptomatic carriage a study to validate gas- trointestinal pathogen panels for asymptomatic pathogen colonization could potentially reducecosts to stool banking programs and improve effi- ciency of screening.using non-toxigenic c. difficile strains as a means to outcompete toxigenic strains is being tested in clini- cal trials.validated commercial assays testing alter- native pcr targets that identify donors colonized with non-pathogenic strains of c. difficile while ruling out asymptomatic carriage of other viral bacterial and protozoal pathogens would be a helpful inclusion cri- terion for ideal stool donors.

in addition there may be future changes in fmt regula- tion including which indications require investiga- tional new drug ind applications oversight of donor selection screening and stool banking practi- ces.as an example of the importance of donor selection outcomes for fmt for inflammatory bowel disease ibd in particular may be sensitive to donor selection and the donor stool microbiota diversity.

we also consider how donor testing may change to reflect evolving understanding of microbiome diversity indices and implications of associations with metabolism and the gut microbiome cardiovascular disease colorectal cancer and multi-drug resistant organisms on donorselection and screening.the fda and regulation in fluxthe fda announced in may of 2013 its intent to clas- sify stool processed for fmt as a biologic agent and regulate fecal material as a drug used for treatment of human disease.

as more is understood about the influence of the human gut microbiota basic science and clinical trial data should be rapidly incorporated to translate benefits and limit risk to patients through updated donor and stool screening for fecal micro- biota transplantation fmt.fmt is best understood as an effective inexpensive and apparently safe method for clinical enrichment of human gut microbiota to treat recurrent clostridium difficile infection rcdi.

further study of conditions that have been associated with the human gut microbiome will clarify which appear more likely to be causal which should be considered in donor selection and screening and which may appropriate for further clinical trials of safety and efficacy.beyond selecting ideal donors for fmt for rcdi in the future it may be relevant to select specific donors for specific fmt indications by relative diver- sity in keystone populations.

the reported 90 cure rate for rcdi treated with fmt with few reported adverse effects underscores the need for rapid and continued improvement in understanding of this treatment.while the practice of preparing human stool to treat human disease has been traced back 1700 years the benefits of fmt have only recently begun to be clarified in modern structured clinical trials.

these joint society recommendations were largely informed by the foundational recommendations of the fmt work- group which were published in 2011.fda guidance for fmt remains in flux but ideally their ultimate reg- ulatory decisions would standardize donor selection and screening to reduce risk without overly limiting access.guidance from professional societies and the fda suggest a preference for selecting stool donors who are known to the patient or providers.

if this draft guidance is enforced and stool banks are not prepared or if there is not a viable commer- cially manufactured alternative fmt product avail- able the burden of donor screening may be shifted to local institutions by default.

further clarification of healthy microbiome indices may streamline stool screens low- ering cost of screening and fmt overall ultimately increasing access.

whether such meas- ures of diversity will be operationalized with nucleic acid sequencing techniques or simple surveillance cul- ture results as a surrogate for dysbiosis is still unclear.screening for non-bacterial members of the gut microbiotamuch of our understanding of the human gut micro- biome has grown from the simultaneous emergence of increasingly affordable and efficient sequencing tech- nology and the evaluation of the clinical application of fmt for cdi as it relates to dysbiosis.

these recommendations and subsequent updates have used blood donor screening as a robust medicolegal analogy to fecal donor screening with donor questionnaires and laboratory testing.this informs much of current published guidance to use questionnaires to identify risk for diseases for which there are no valid laboratory tests or for which there may be an undetectable early-stage or window- period and to use appropriate diagnostics for diseases which can be tested.since the fda's announcement in 2013 there has been incremental revision in donor selection and screening practices with input from experts and donor screening data from public stool banking organizations.a summary of published donor screening protocols is shown in .

on the other hand use of nucleic acid based diagnostics on formed stool instead of watery stool may decrease the sensitivity by decreasing the number of true carriers detected if there are inade- quate primers for the sample being tested.
