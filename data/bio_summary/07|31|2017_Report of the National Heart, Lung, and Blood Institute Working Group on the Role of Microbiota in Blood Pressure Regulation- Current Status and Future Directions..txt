These include the following 1 Does the gut microbiota influence arterial function and BP with primary aging aging in the absence of clinical disease and in age-related CVDs such as essential hypertension Additional cause-and-effect studies eg gut microbiota transfer experiments are needed.2 What specific changes to the microbiome microbe com- position and metabolite production associated with aging or age-related diseases cause arterial dysfunction and effects on BP 3 What are the integrated physiological mechanisms connecting the gut microbiota to arterial dysfunction and ele- vated BP For example are inflammatory mediators released into the circulation via a leaky gut What is the potential role of elevated circulating TMAO with aging 4 Do environ- mental influences exercise diet sleep stress smoking anti- biotic use etc modulate the gut microbiota to alter arterial function BP and health with aging If so how 5 What is the potential efficacy of preventive and therapeutic strategies that target the gut microbiota to mitigate arterial dysfunction and elevated BP with agingDiet-Induced Gut Microbial Metabolites in CVD and HypertensionThe gut microbiota can directly influence downstream path- ways leading to autonomic imbalance and immune responses.

Epidemiological studies indicate that high-fiber diet is associated with reduced BP and CVD.1353 Also many studies have been reported regarding the beneficial effects of certainprobiotic bacterial strains that can decrease circulating levels of cholesterol and BP.14 A recent meta-analysis of random- ized controlled trials has also demonstrated beneficial effects of probiotics in reducing BP.12 However some studies have failed to find any beneficial effect of probiotics on BP heart rate or cardiovascular risk markers.131453 Thus further studies are needed to resolve this conundrum.Animal studies have demonstrated the role of diet and gut microbiota in BP control and hypertension.

Despite intensive attempts to influence lifestyle changes nutritional counseling and intensive antihy- pertensive drug treatment strategies 14 of all hypertension patients seem to be resistant to antihypertensive interven- tions.1 Resistant hypertension is defined as BP above goal 14090 mm Hg on 3 BP-lowering medications or needing4 medications prescribed at optimal dose to control BP to goal.

In fact several recent studies have identi- fied gut dysbiosis being associated with hypertension and new links between brain-gut kidney-gut and microbial metab- olites-host interactions in BP homeostasis.8-11 These results coupled with a sense of urgency to discover novel mechanism- based therapeutic strategies for hypertension led the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to convene a Working Group WG on June 10 2016 to discuss this emerging area of the role of microbiota in BP regulation.

On the basis of previous evidence connecting dietary salt and BP regula- tion microbial-host interactions were investigated in various models of hypertension including in the salt-sensitive rat model of hypertension that is the Dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats fed with high-salt diet.8 The hypothesis was that the gut microbiota composition in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat would be different from that in salt-resistant rats despite identical diets and housing conditions and that changes in microbiota composition would result in BP modifications.

The genome of salt-resistant rats is resistant to alterations in BP consistent with the finding that their BP was not altered by fecal microbiota transplant from hypertensive Dahl salt- sensitive rats.8 On the contrary fecal microbiota transplant from salt-resistant rats induced sustained and exacerbated high BP in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.

The recent attempts to use percutaneous renal artery sympathetic denervation as a novel means to control hypertension have been largely unsuccessful to date.45 Therefore there is a crucial need to discover novel and innovative ways to address the BP control issue.Recent studies showing a role for microbiota in BP regu- lation might provide promising new therapeutic approaches.

Increased gut permeability is an important factor in enhancing bidirectional flow of biological mediators including microbes microbial products hormones immune cells and so on thus affecting peripheral and central BP control mechanisms.In summary several recent studies have provided the initial bases for the fundamental concept that the gut micro- biota is involved in BP control and hypertension.
