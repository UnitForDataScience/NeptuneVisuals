these include the following 1 does the gut microbiota influence arterial function and bp with primary aging aging in the absence of clinical disease and in age-related cvds such as essential hypertension additional cause-and-effect studies eg gut microbiota transfer experiments are needed.2 what specific changes to the microbiome microbe com- position and metabolite production associated with aging or age-related diseases cause arterial dysfunction and effects on bp 3 what are the integrated physiological mechanisms connecting the gut microbiota to arterial dysfunction and ele- vated bp for example are inflammatory mediators released into the circulation via a leaky gut what is the potential role of elevated circulating tmao with aging 4 do environ- mental influences exercise diet sleep stress smoking anti- biotic use etc modulate the gut microbiota to alter arterial function bp and health with aging if so how 5 what is the potential efficacy of preventive and therapeutic strategies that target the gut microbiota to mitigate arterial dysfunction and elevated bp with agingdiet-induced gut microbial metabolites in cvd and hypertensionthe gut microbiota can directly influence downstream path- ways leading to autonomic imbalance and immune responses.

wilson tang young s. ohrecent american heart association report shows that 34 of us adults 20 years of age have hypertension repre- senting 86 million adults.1 a substantial increase in the preva- lence of hypertension has occurred globally.2 the projected number of individuals with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm hg has doubled from 442 million in 1990 to 874 million in 2015. hypertension is one of the most prevalent risk fac- tors for cardiovascular disease cvd.1 results of the recently concluded sprint systolic blood pressure intervention trial funded by the national heart lung and blood institute showed that among older adults with hypertension but without diabetes mellitus lowering systolic blood pressure to a target goal of 120 mm hg compared with the standard goal of 140 mm hg resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfa-tal cardiovascular events and death from any cause.3some groups such as blacks who display both dispropor- tionately earlier onset and higher prevalence of hypertension have increased risk of blood pressure bp-related cardio- vascular and renal disease complications compared with non-hispanic whites.

despite intensive attempts to influence lifestyle changes nutritional counseling and intensive antihy- pertensive drug treatment strategies 14 of all hypertension patients seem to be resistant to antihypertensive interven- tions.1 resistant hypertension is defined as bp above goal 14090 mm hg on 3 bp-lowering medications or needing4 medications prescribed at optimal dose to control bp to goal.

in fact several recent studies have identi- fied gut dysbiosis being associated with hypertension and new links between brain-gut kidney-gut and microbial metab- olites-host interactions in bp homeostasis.8-11 these results coupled with a sense of urgency to discover novel mechanism- based therapeutic strategies for hypertension led the national heart lung and blood institute to convene a working group wg on june 10 2016 to discuss this emerging area of the role of microbiota in bp regulation.

on the basis of previous evidence connecting dietary salt and bp regula- tion microbial-host interactions were investigated in various models of hypertension including in the salt-sensitive rat model of hypertension that is the dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats fed with high-salt diet.8 the hypothesis was that the gut microbiota composition in the dahl salt-sensitive rat would be different from that in salt-resistant rats despite identical diets and housing conditions and that changes in microbiota composition would result in bp modifications.

epidemiological studies indicate that high-fiber diet is associated with reduced bp and cvd.1353 also many studies have been reported regarding the beneficial effects of certainprobiotic bacterial strains that can decrease circulating levels of cholesterol and bp.14 a recent meta-analysis of random- ized controlled trials has also demonstrated beneficial effects of probiotics in reducing bp.12 however some studies have failed to find any beneficial effect of probiotics on bp heart rate or cardiovascular risk markers.131453 thus further studies are needed to resolve this conundrum.animal studies have demonstrated the role of diet and gut microbiota in bp control and hypertension.

the wg was organized into 4 thematic sessions 1 the link between microbiota and hypertension session included pre- sentations on gut-brain axis and microbiota in animal models of hypertension and vascular dysfunction 2 a session on the role of microbiota in human disease included cvd kidney dis- ease and metabolic syndrome 3 the oral microbiota session discussed the human oral microbiome database advances in metagenomic and metabolomic technologies and the role of nitrate in bp regulation and 4 discussion on microbiota as a potential therapeutic target included dietary modifica- tions circadian regulation and impact of chronic stress on the gut-brain axis.

in this report we provide a summary of the wg presentations discussion and its recommendations for future research directions.gut microbiota and hypertensionindirect involvement of gut microbiota in bp regulation and hypertension has been known for some time primarily from studies involving fermented milk probiotics and meta-anal- ysis of randomized trials.12-14 evidence for a more direct link was first presented in 2 simultaneous reports using several different animal models of hypertension ie dahl salt-sensi- tive and salt-resistant rats spontaneously hypertensive rats and angiotensin ii-infusion rat models.811 significant changes in gut microbiota and alterations in firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio were found to be linked with high bp.11 furthermore the microbiota of hypertensive animals demonstrated significant decreases in butyrate- and acetate-producing bacterial popula- tions.

studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiota play an obligatory role in producing trimethylaminetmao and its generation is a combined result of dietary exposure and microbial metabolism.3233 accumulation of circulating tmao can lead to a wide range of adverse effects including macro- phagefoam cell activation steroid and bile acid metabolism vascular and endothelial cell dysfunction and platelet hyper- responsiveness leading to atherosclerosis cardiorenal impair- ment and thrombosis.34 although tmao does not affect bp in normotensive animals it prolongs the hypertensive effect of angiotensin ii suggesting the possibility that tmao increases the susceptibility to developing hypertension.35 thus further investigations on the role of gut microbial-derived metabolitesin the pathophysiology of hypertension are warranted for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.microbiota-derived toxins and ckd hypertension is an important risk factor for ckd and is the second leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the united states.36 evidence has been accumulating in recent years as to alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with ckd and end-stage renal disease.3738 patients with ckd have an increase in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the upper intes- tinal tract.

the recent attempts to use percutaneous renal artery sympathetic denervation as a novel means to control hypertension have been largely unsuccessful to date.45 therefore there is a crucial need to discover novel and innovative ways to address the bp control issue.recent studies showing a role for microbiota in bp regu- lation might provide promising new therapeutic approaches.

increased gut permeability is an important factor in enhancing bidirectional flow of biological mediators including microbes microbial products hormones immune cells and so on thus affecting peripheral and central bp control mechanisms.in summary several recent studies have provided the initial bases for the fundamental concept that the gut micro- biota is involved in bp control and hypertension.

the genome of salt-resistant rats is resistant to alterations in bp consistent with the finding that their bp was not altered by fecal microbiota transplant from hypertensive dahl salt- sensitive rats.8 on the contrary fecal microbiota transplant from salt-resistant rats induced sustained and exacerbated high bp in dahl salt-sensitive rats.
