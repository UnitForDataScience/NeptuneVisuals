Recent studies using transgenic IgE reporter mice have identified IgE cells within the GC and the subsequent detection of affinity mature IgE suggests that this reaction con- tributes to the IgE-secreting PC compartment 7 13 15 16.

However the kinetics of IgE GC cell formation and serum IgE detection during helminth infection parallels the detection of both IgE PCs in the medullary sinuses a region relatively dis- tant from GCs and B cell follicles 16.

Collectively our results indicate that even in the setting of robust Th2 cell differentiation Tfh cells are critical for driving the primary IgE response during helminth infection.The GC reaction is not required for IgE switching and Ab productionThe observed loss of IgE PC generation in 4getKN2.TDBcl6 mice may be due to a compromised GC reaction an indirect consequenceThe Journal of Immunology247FIGURE 2.

Understanding the nature of T cell help required for IgE production and the cellular requirements that orchestrate IgE re- sponses could provide important insight into mechanisms regu- lating type 2 immunity.CD4 Th2 cells that express the lineage-specific transcription factor Gata-3 are potent producers of type 2 cytokines including IL-4 IL-5 and IL-13 at sites of inflammation and infection 4.

These results bring into question the requirement for the GC reaction in IgE PC de- velopment and suggest that extra-GC T cell-B cell interactions may play an important role in IgE production.

With the aim of under- standing the cellular requirements for the primary IgE response we hypothesized that Tfh cells provide a nonredundant source of IL-4 required to initiate IgE class switching during infection with the parasitic helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri.
