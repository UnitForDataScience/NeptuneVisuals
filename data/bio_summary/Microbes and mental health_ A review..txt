Oral antibiotics given to specific pathogen free mice and colonization of GF BALBc mice with NIH Swiss mice have been shown to increase exploratory behavior with increased BDNF expression as well .

For example when BALB c mice were inoculated from NIH Swiss mice they increased exploratory behavior whereas NIH Swiss mice inoculated with BALBc microbes had reduced exploratory behavior  .

A deeper understanding of the metabolic signaling and immune system axes that physiologically connect the gut liver muscle and brain is prerequisite for optimizing therapeutic strategies to manipulate the gut microbiota to improve human health .Microbiota-gut-brain axisReciprocal communication between the gut and brain is now well recognized .

Given the complex network of communica- tion between the gut microbiota and brain and the exchange of information across the gut-brain axis these microorganisms may also influence brain chemistry and behavior.

Our discussion below highlights several of these key communication and neurobiological pathways including through the vagus nerve cell wall metabolites and neurotransmitters and brain neu- rotrophic factors which collectively may help to elucidate the effects of the microbiota on homeostasis and complex CNS disorders.Vagus nerveThe vagus or tenth X cranial nerve which conveys efferent and afferent sensory information between the periphery and the CNS constitutes a direct link from the gut to the brain  .

Interestingly animals infected with pathogenic Citrobacter rodentium and Campylobacter jejuni evidence increased levels of c-FOS in vagal sensory ganglia and vis- ceral sensory nuclei in autonomic and select brain regions par- aventricular nuclei basolateral nuclei of the amygdala bed nucleus of the stria terminalis medial prefrontal and anterior cin- gulate cortices compared to non-infected animals suggesting links between GI pathogenic challenges and brain regions impli- cated in anxiety .

For example pro- inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 IL-6 and chemo- kine ligand 2 CCL2 can act on the brain via two pathways 1 a humoral pathway in which PAMPs act on toll-like receptors TLRs in specific brain areas and 2 a neural pathway through afferent nerves.

More studies are necessary to confirm these findings however the potent immunomodulatory effects of the gut microbiota on both the mucosal and systemic immune system highlights potential mechanisms through which the gut microbiota may influence brain function and behavior.MetabolitesMetabolites derived from both the digestion and microbial fer- mentation of dietary and nutritional components may have a sig- nificant effect on brain processes and immune responses.

Thus one proposed mechanism through which bacteria may be influencing brain chemistry is through regulation of the GABA system.SerotoninSerotonin is also a monoamine neurotransmitter implicated in the regulation of virtually all brain functions and modulates a num- ber of physiological processes such as mood sleep pain aggression and sexual behavior.

This pioneering study suggests that con- sumption of a probiotic fermented dairy product may be associated with modulations of brain regions concerned with the central pro- cessing of afferent signals from the gut and brain regions involved in emotional reactivity.Although the precise mechanisms-of-action remain unknownconsiderable data supports the possibility that probiotics confer health benefits .
