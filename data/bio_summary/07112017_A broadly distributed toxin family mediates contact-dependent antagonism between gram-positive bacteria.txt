For the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthesis reactions coupled to thedegradation by TelCtox0.04 mM Farnesyl pyrophosphate and 0.4 mM isopentenyl pyrophosphate were solubilized in 20 mM HEPESKOH pH 7.5 50 mM KCl 0.5 mM MgCl2 1 mM CaCl2 0.1 Tri- ton X-100 and incubated with 10 mM UppS and 2 mM TelCtox final concentrations or protein buffer for 5 hr at 25C and 90 min at 37C.

For the undecaprenyl phosphate reactions 100 mM undecaprenyl phosphate Larodan was solubilized in 20 mM HEPESKOH pH 7.5 150 mM KCl 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 Triton X-100 before adding 2 mM TelCtox final concentration 2 mM TelCtox-TipCDss or protein buffer fol- lowed by incubation for 5 hr at 25C and 90 min at 37C.

Lipid II was kindly provided by Ute Bertsche and was generated as described previously .For thin-layer chromatography TLC analysis of Lys-type lipid II degradation by TelC TelCtox or TelCtox-TipCDss 40 mM lipid II was solubilized in 30 mM HEPESKOH pH 7.5 150 mM KCl and 0.1 Triton X-100 before adding either 2 mM TelCtox 2 mM TelCtox-TipCDss complex or protein buffer fol- lowed by incubation for 90 min at 37C.

The progress of the refine- ment was monitored by the reduction of Rwork and Rfree .Peptidoglycan hydrolase assayPurified TelCtox was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6 150 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl2.

Protease inhibitors 1 mM AEBSF 10 mM leupeptin and 1 mM pepstatin were added to the filtered supernatants prior to dialysis in 4L of PBS using 10 kDa molecular weight cut off tubing at 4C.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 15 min followedby resuspension in 35 mL of buffer A 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 300 mM NaCl 10 mM imidazole.

Bound proteins were then eluted using 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 300 mM NaCl 400 mM imidazole.

PG was isolated as described  and digested with either cellosyl muramidase or lysostaphin endo- peptidase and cellosyl reduced with sodium borohydride and analyzed by HPLC as described above.Lipid II phosphatase assayPurified TelCtox and TelCtox-TipCDss complex were dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6 150 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl2.

C14-labelled Lys-type lipid II was solubilized in 5 mL of Triton X-100 before being added to 95 mL of reaction buffer containing 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5 0.4 mM CaCl2 excluded from the PBP1B-LpoB reaction 150 mM NaCl 0.023 Triton X-100 and either PBP1B- LpoB complex TelCtox TelCtox-TipCDss complex or Colicin M followed by incubation for 1 hr at37C.
