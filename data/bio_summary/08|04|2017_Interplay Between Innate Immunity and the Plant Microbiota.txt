Those hubs might be competitive microbiota members whose proliferation must be kept at bay by the plant immune system.A FUNCTION FOR EFFECTOR-TRIGGERED IMMUNITY IN GUARDING SYMBIOSIS PATHWAYSBesides innate immunity key features of the vertebrate immune system are an additional adap- tive immune arm and dedicated circulating immune cells.

A conceptual advance often referred to as the zigzag model linksthe engagement of two classes of immune receptors for the activation of immune responses to host-adapted pathogens with the actions of pathogen-derived molecules that subvert immune sig- naling 65.

Consequently a subset of NLR-type immune receptors in plants might guard such common host components that are manipulated by microbial effectors during pathogenesis or establishment of beneficial interactions.ROLE OF IMMUNE OUTPUTS FOR ACCOMMODATION OF BENEFICIAL MICROBESSeveral studies in animals point to an important role of innate immune signaling and immune outputs as determinants for microbiota establishment and accommodation of beneficial microbes.

All rights reservedKeywordsmicrobial communities microbiota symbionts pathogens plant immune system microbial ecologyAbstractThe innate immune system of plants recognizes microbial pathogens and terminates their growth.

This immune layer involves sensing of microbe-associated molecular patterns MAMPs by pattern recognition receptors PRRs that initiate quantitative immune responses to control host-microbial load whereas diversification of MAMPs and PRRs emerges as a mechanism that locally sculpts microbial assemblages in plant populations.

The finding that similar molecular strategies are deployed by symbionts and pathogens to dampen immune responses is consistent with this hypothesis but implies different selective pressures on the immune system due to contrasting out- comes on plant fitness.

Nonetheless we cannot exclude the possibility that some plant microbiota members have evolved alternative strategies to dampen host immune responses.A major difference between pathogens and symbionts relates to invasion-associated damageinflicted upon the host which imposes different selective pressures on the host immune system due to contrasting outcomes on plant fitness Figure 1.

However because only a small proportion of bacterial microbiota members 10 see above has the potential to suppress immune responses via the T3SS these bacteria might play a role as pioneer species by inducing immune tolerance for sequential or par- allel immigration by the bulk of the microbiota.

The essential role of immune outputs for modulating microbial colonization and promoting or sustaining symbiotic associations suggests that the plant immune system has not exclusively evolved to detect pathogens and terminate their proliferation but must be viewed as a microbial management system that is also engaged for the controlled accommodation of beneficial microbes Figure 3.THE PLANT MICROBIOTA AS A DEVELOPMENTAL SIGNAL AND MODULATOR OF IMMUNE RESPONSESMicrobes inhabited earth long before the evolution of land plants and for this reason green eu- karyotic life most likely evolved continuously in response to microbe-derived molecules in their environments.
