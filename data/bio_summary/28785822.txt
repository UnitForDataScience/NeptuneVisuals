In this review we will discuss alterations in intestinal microbiota and how these alterations may exacerbate IBS and introduce several new IBS treatment options aiming at re-establishing a healthy and beneficial ecosystem.IntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome IBS is one of the most common func- tional bowel disorders the prevalence of which in the general population ranges from 5 to 15 worldwide .

In this review we will focus on gut microbiota alteration the impact of gut microbiota alter- ation on symptom generation and the curative effect of regulat- ing these microbes in IBS.Intestinal microbiota composition in IBS patientsNumerous bacterial species are differentially abundant in IBS patients as compared with healthy controls.

Recently alteration in gut microbiota composition has been recognized as an important pathogenetic and pathophysiological factor in multiple diseases such as obesity   type 2 diabetes mellitus DM2 cancer  inflammatory bowel disease IBD   and IBS.
