fed diets contained dif- ferent ratios of n-6n-3 pufa including 201 151 and 101. no differences were detected among the treatments for average daily feed intake adfi of sows and the back fat levels during lactation p  0.05. body weight bw loss of sows after farrowing to weanling was greater in the 101 treatment compared with 151 or 201 p  0.05. in piglets a great significant difference for bw was observed at 4 weeks p  0.01. furthermore average daily gain adg of piglets in the 101 treatment was higher p  0.05. no difference was observed among treatments in nutrient digestibility of sows p  0.05. a great significant difference for fecal microbiota was in the 101 treatment compared with 201 and 151 treatments p  0.01. in conclusion altering the ratio of n-6n-3 pufa in gestation-lactating sow diet had no difference on nutrient digestibility in gestation-lactating sows but it can partially improve reproductive performance.key words fecal microbiota gestation-lactating sow n-6n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids nutrient digestibility reproductive performance.introductionessential fatty acids can be separated into two kinds of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa n-6 and n-3 pufa these two classes of essential fatty acids are not inter-convertible and often have important opposing physiological functions.

addi- tionally whether altering the ratio of n-6n-3 pufa that can improve sows' nutrient digestibility is unknown.thus the aim of the trial was to investigate the effect of different ratios of dietary n-6n-3 pufa on the reproductive performance fecal microbiota and nutrient digestibility in gestation-lactating sows and suckling piglets.materials and methodsthe experimental protocol used in this study was approved by the animal care and use committee of dankook university which is comparable to those laid down by the canadian council on animal care.source of n-6n-3 pufathe omega-3 fatty acid used in this study was pro- vided by a commercial company morningbio co. ltd. cheonan korea.

during lactation daily feed allowance was increased gradually until sows had ad libitum access to feed by week 2. all diets were provided in meal form twice daily and sows had free access to drinking water throughout the experimental period.

the e. coli and lactobacillus were counted immediately after removal from the incubator.apparent total tract digestibility attd of nutrients in sowsto determine the attd for dm nitrogen n and gross energy ge sows were fed diets containing chromic oxide 0.2 as an indigestible marker for 5 days followed by fecal grab sampling from five sows per treatment via rectal palpation before farrowing after farrowing and on weaning day.

after farrowing to weanling sow bw loss in the 101 group decreased p  0.05 com- pared with 201 and 151 groups.it is well known that the weight loss of lactating sows due to mobilization of fatty acids and protein can vary considerably between sows mullan  williams 1990. this suggests that fatty acids-rich diets do not reduce mobilization of body stores.

it has been suggested a high n-6n-3 ratio is considered to be a critical factor in both performance and nutrient digestibility in studies in man and animal models.during the past years studies had demonstrated that animal performance could be influenced by the level or the ratio of n-6 and n-3 pufa in sows anddogs wander et al.

2007. previously it was unknown whether a particular ratio of n-6n-3 pufa in maternal diet is beneficial to gestation-lac- tating sows' reproductive performance.

however it could be hypothesized that in the case of providing a diet for sows with a low n-6n-3 ratio reproductive performance and consequently postpartum feed intake would be improved whereas diets with a high n-6n-3 ratio would not exert these benefits quelen et al.
