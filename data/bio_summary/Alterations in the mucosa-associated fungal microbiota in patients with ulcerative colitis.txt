As it is believed that mucosa-associated microbiota is more relevant to the pathogenesis of IBD than fecal microbiota we studied the association between intestinal mucosal fungi and intestinal inflammation in this study and uncovered a potential link between the intestinal fungi and IBD pathogenesis.In conclusion this study confirms an alteration of mucosal fungal community in UC patients compared with HS and puts forward the hypothesis that several specific fungal genera andor species play important roles in intestinal inflammation.

However the fungal Shannon biodiversity index values were similar between the two groups Figure 1C.Taxonomy of the intestinal mucosal-associated fungal microbiota in UC patients and HSWe analyzed the gut fungal microbiota in the mucosal samples from UC patients and HS based on ITS1-2 rDNA sequencing.

PLS- DA score plots Figure 2B and heatmaps Figure 2C based on the core OTUs Supplementary Table 1 revealed that the colonic mucosal fungal community in the HS and UC patients could be classified into two different clusters which suggested that fungal compositions in UC patients were different from that in HS.Shifts in the fungal communities in inflamed intestinal mucosaTwo dominant phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota accounted for more than 99 of the population in all of the samples Figure 3A-3B.

In addition the proportions of Cladosporium Nigrospora and Sporobolomyces were similar between the two groups Figures 4 and 5.Correlation between intestinal fungal composition and mucosal inflammatory statusWe evaluated the intestinal fungal composition at the phylum and genus levels and analyzed its correlations with several mucosal inflammatory cytokines IL-Ib TNF-a INF-g IL-6 IL-17A and IL-23 and Baron and Mayo scores in UC patients.

However Sporobolomyces was negatively correlated with the expression of IL-6 and the Trametes was negatively correlated with the intestinal IL-1b level and clinical Baron score Figure 7.Figure 7 Correlation between intestinal fungal composition and intestinal inflammatory status.

The Baron and Mayo scores of UC patients were evaluated and the correlation between intestinal fungal composition and intestinal inflammatory status was analyzed.INTRODUCTIONUlcerative colitis UC a major type of inflammatory bowel disease IBD 1 is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is limited to the colon and rectum.

Our previous studies showed that the fecal fungal microbiota is significantly different from its mucosal counterpart 12.In this study in order to investigate whether there is dysbiosis of the fungal microbiota in UC patients we analyzed the fungal microbiota of the colonic mucosa in both UC patients and HS using high-throughput sequencing technology.

In addition the association between intestinal fungi and intestinal inflammation was assessed to uncover the link between the fungal microbiota and IBD pathogenesis.RESULTSCharacteristics of the study participantsIn this study we collected mucosal samples from 14 UC patients 6 females and 8 males and 15 normal healthy controls 7 females and 8 males.

Thus we further investigated the association between intestinal fungi and mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the clinical Baron and Mayo scores.The fungal composition is not significantly correlated with the intestinal inflammation at the phylum level.

Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyzethe correlation between intestinal fungal composition and intestinal inflammatory status.
