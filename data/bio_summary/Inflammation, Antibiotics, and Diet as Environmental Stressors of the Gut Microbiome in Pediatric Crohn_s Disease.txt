We filtered out low abundance gene pathways with max abundance  0.1 across all samples or present in 0 samples.The correct version should read as followsWe filtered out the samples with non-human reads  30000 and bacterial genera with max abundance  1 across all samples or present in 10 of all samples.

The originally published version appears here with typos indicated in italic textWe filtered out the samples with non-human reads  30000 and bacterial genera with max abundance  1 across all samples or present in 0 of all samples.

The distance between samples was measured by the Jaccard index.

The pamk func- tion in R package fpc was used to find the optimal clustering of bacterial data.
