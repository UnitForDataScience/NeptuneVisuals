The discharge of high TDS effluent onto land results in increased soil sali- nity and elevated TDS of ground water as well as surface water.

These floating phyto-beds were built using PVC pipes aluminum metal wire gauze and the PVC plastic sheet having length 2.1 x 1.2 m. The plastic pipes were cut and joined with a plastic elbows to get the rec- tangular shape of 2.1 x 1.2 m body.

The total weight of FPB was 7 kg and it was observed to manage to float even if the load reached 35 kg.

The treatment parameters like ADMI COD BOD TDS TSS and pH were checked after every 24 h of time interval during the treatment .Rhizospheric soil bacterial community analysis of respective plant systems during textile effluent treatment using Terminal Restriction Length Polymorphism T-RFLPThe T-RFLP analysis was carried out to find the microbial commu- nity associated with rhizosphere of three different plant systems F. dichotoma L. A. baccifera L. and consortium FA on the phyto-beds during phytoremediation.

The soil associated with roots of different plant system was collected.

The whole genomic DNA of soil bacteria was isolated using bead-beating procedure .

The 16s r- RNA gene was amplified by using 6 FAM 6 carboxyl fluorescein florescent labeled forward primer F27 5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCT- CMG-3' and reverse primer R1492 5'-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACT- 3' .

The purified PCR products of a 16s rRNA gene 200-300 ng were digested at 37 degC for 9 h with 2 U of restriction enzyme AluI AGCT and MspI CCGG separately.

The constructed binary matrix was imported into NTSYS-PC program version 2.1 .

The decolorization experiments were carried out using 1000 mL glass beakers taking 400 mL Methyl Orange solution at a concentration of 50 ppm.
