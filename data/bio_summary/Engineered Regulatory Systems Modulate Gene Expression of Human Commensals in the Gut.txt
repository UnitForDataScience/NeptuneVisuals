the tetr-p1tdpgh023-nanoluc cassette could be readily introduced into all isolates and each exhibited robust induction of luminescence in an atc-depen- dent manner .the expression range of p1t gh023 alone captures 86 ofto further test the cross-species performance of tetr-p1tdpthe 18 native b. thetaiotaomicron promoters tested which corre- sponds to 97 of the transcriptome c. these re- sults establish that the p1tdp platform provides the capacity to express bacteroides proteins to their native levels.evaluation and performance of the p1tdp platform in different bacteroides speciesto facilitate gene expression control across species we built a self-contained 1 kb inducible expression cassette designated tetr-p1tdp in which tetr is expressed from the p2a21 promoter and oriented in the opposite direction from p1tdpgh023 thereby providing the ability to artificially regulate gene expression in unmodified strains of multiple species in a single step .

this dy- namic control of gene repression and expression are recapitu- lated or even exceeded in mice and investigation of sialic acid provides a first example of insights gained from manipulating a host-microbe interaction by tuning expression of a single gene in the microbiome.variations in tetr-regulated promoters expand the versatility range and regulatory properties of this system  .

together these results indicate that the levels of this microbiome-dependent metabolite reflect not only the current activity of the microbiota but also its activity from days before.btrs dynamically modulates sialidase expression in response to changing inducer levels providing the op- portunity to compare sialidase activity and fecal sialic acid concentration in vivo as atc is eliminated from the gut and sialidase gene expression changes accordingly d. at low levels of sialidase activity fecal sialic acid scales in proportion to enzyme activity.

enzyme reactions contained the artificial substrate 2-o-p-nitrophenyl- tropheacetylneuraminic acid pnp-sa which is cleaved by bt0455 to release sialic acid and p-nitrophenyl pnp the latter of which was measured by lc-ms. the initial velocities of this reaction were measured every 5 min at 37oc for 30 min and a best-fit line and its slope was determined to ensure that enzyme concentrations in the lysate were directly proportional to the initial velocities.d and e sialidase activity and e free sialic acid in feces was measured for bt3xtetr green line and bt3xtetr dbt0455 red line for the first four days for sialidase activity or for the full experiment for free sialic acid shown in .

while the promoters with a single teto2 exhibit at most an 80-fold induction of reporter activity in the presence of atc promoter p1tdp increases luminescence over 2000-fold in response to the inducer b. consistent with this result introduction of the panel of promoter-lpxf fusions into an dlpxf mutant constitutively expressing tetr bttetr dlpxf revealed that tetr represses expression of the p1tdp-lpxf fusion to levels that reduce pmb mic by over 10000-fold functionally equiva- lent to the absence of lpxf entirely 0.064 mgml c. in strains carrying the other promoters tetr expression also reduces pmb mic although some resistance remains  c. except for p1tc addition of 100 ngml atc restores pmb mic to wild-type levels in each case c. additional examination of the sensitivity and temporal dynamics of the sys- tem showed that p1tdp expression can be tuned over a 100-fold range in atc concentration and induces in response to atc within one round of cell division figures s1b and s1c.
