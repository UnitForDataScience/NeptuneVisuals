The bacterial sequences obtained were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers KX260635- KX260916.DiscussionIn this study the bacterial microbiota of the common house mosquito Cx.

Interestingly another invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus Asian tiger mosquito showed a reduced bacterial microbiota in recently established popula- tions France compared to autochthonous populations Vietnam possibly due to an alteredreduced availability of plant nutrition sources within the new habitats Minard et al.

There might be general interspecific variations in associated bacterial diversity of mosquito species based on different eco- logical and biological habits however those cannot be suffi- ciently evaluated due to the currently scarce data situation.ConclusionIn this study the microbiota of two mosquito species Cx.

japonicus showed a diverse bacterial community including some common bacterial genera.

Most of the bacterial genera found in our study have been identified in other mosquito species before.

Although a variety of established German mosquito species are also known as potential vectors for disease agents there are currently no studies about the composition and struc- ture of their associated bacterial communities.

This study is the first study to investigate the bacterial microbiota diversity of the common mosquito species Cx.

japonicus mosquitoes were used for subsequent bacterial analyses.Bacterial diversity in Culex pipiens and Aedes japonicusAfter the cloning reactions not more than 28 colonies per mosquito specimen positive by bluewhite screening Cx.
