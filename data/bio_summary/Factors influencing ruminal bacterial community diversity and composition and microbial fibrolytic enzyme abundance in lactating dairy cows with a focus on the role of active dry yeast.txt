Given that most studies employed a stomach tubing method to collect rumen samples the epimural community is understudied in cattle.The supplementation of ADY in this experiment hadno effect on any of the diversity measures in any of the diets or sampling locations.Dominance and Prevalence of OTU with Emphasis on Fluid and Solids During HF and HG FeedingIn this study a dominant OTU was defined as an OTU that consists of at least or equal to 1 of total sequences and only dominant OTU were included in the analysis.

This process has been shown based on a previous study to reduce the number of spuri- ous OTU AlZahal et al.

This process was implemented to avoid inflation of diversity indices observed due to the presence of rare OTU Kunin et al.

The current study however provided evidence that specific F. succinogenes OTU were abundant in the rumen and increased on solids with the supplemen- tation of ADY as an evidence of improved anaerobicfermentation which supports our previous report.Additionally it has been shown that F. succinogenes species can degrade fiber faster and more effectively than Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus which gives this bacterium an advantage in establishing a niche within the rumen over other fi- ber degraders Kobayashi et al.

Further examination of the top 17 Prevotella OTU present within the top 50 OTU data not shown revealed that these Prevotella OTU were less abun- dant in HG-fluid-ADY than HG-fluid-control 22.8 vs. 30.8 SE  0.1.ADY Modes of ActionSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a type of yeast that can use both aerobic respiration and fermentation to gener- ate the energy required for growth.

We conducted the ruminal microbial sampling on wk 5 HF and wk 10 HG to allow sufficient time for the ruminal microbial commu- nity to adapt to each diet therefore we assume that our analyses reflect adapted and stable communities.DNA Library Preparation and SequencingGenomic DNA was extracted as detailed in AlZa- hal et al.

Although the HG diet con- tained a high level of rapidly fermentable carbohydrate 45.2 of DM it was a corn-silage haylage-based diet and contained 28.2 NDF see Table 1 in AlZahal et al.

The 19 groups at the ge- nus level that were included in the analysis constituted78.6 and 74.5 of total epimural sequences during HF and HG respectively.Our study demonstrated that the majority of abun- dant bacterial groups and what were previously de- fined as core bacteria Henderson et al.

High forage and solids were dominated by OTU from Fibrobacter whereas HG and fluid were dominated by OTU from Prevotella.
