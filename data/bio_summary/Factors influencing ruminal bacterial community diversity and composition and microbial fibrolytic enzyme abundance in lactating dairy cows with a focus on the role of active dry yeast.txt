given that most studies employed a stomach tubing method to collect rumen samples the epimural community is understudied in cattle.the supplementation of ady in this experiment hadno effect on any of the diversity measures in any of the diets or sampling locations.dominance and prevalence of otu with emphasis on fluid and solids during hf and hg feedingin this study a dominant otu was defined as an otu that consists of at least or equal to 1 of total sequences and only dominant otu were included in the analysis.

on the other hand dur-ing hf no prevotella otu was prevalent with the exception of otu4 which was prevalent in the fluid fraction only.the switch to hg and thus the change in substrate was hallmarked by the dominance of otu1 a prevotel- la that had almost no presence during hf 0.001. operational taxonomic unit 1 replaced otu2 f. suc- cinogenes to become the most dominant and prevalent otu across all sampling locations and also replacing otu4 to become the most prevalent prevotella otu.

further examination of the top 17 prevotella otu present within the top 50 otu data not shown revealed that these prevotella otu were less abun- dant in hg-fluid-ady than hg-fluid-control 22.8 vs. 30.8 se  0.1.ady modes of actionsaccharomyces cerevisiae is a type of yeast that can use both aerobic respiration and fermentation to gener- ate the energy required for growth.

high forage and solids were dominated by otu from fibrobacter whereas hg and fluid were dominated by otu from prevotella.

this process has been shown based on a previous study to reduce the number of spuri- ous otu alzahal et al.

this process was implemented to avoid inflation of diversity indices observed due to the presence of rare otu kunin et al.

in addition the get.coremicrobiome function was used to predict the otu that were prevalent in all samples or in a given group of samples combinations of diet x location x treat at abundance level 1. thus the term core in our study refers to otu that are both prevalent in 100 of samples in each group and dominant 1 of total sequencing data.taxonomic classificationoperational taxonomic units were classified using the greengenes database.

the resulting sequences were clustered into 14167 otu in which 6254 nonsingleton otu.

the separa- tion by treatment ady vs. control table 2 was not significant p  0.1.the investigation also included defining otu that are unique exclusive to given groups or otu that are shared across groups of samples.

only 1 otu otu342 prevotella was unique to epimural samples whereas no otu were unique to fluid or solids.

additionally the top 20 otu 0.14 of otu constituted approxi- mately 27 of total sequences.

at the species level only 440 otu 3 of total otu were classifiable which included 93 named species.
