Differences among bac- terial communities for different factors abattoir cut storage time based on phylogenetic distance were calculated using UniFrac .ResultsTRFLP analysis of VP beef primal communities from different abattoirsIn order to test the impact of abattoir on community structure variation the bacterial TRFLP profiles generated for each sample were compared using PERMANOVA.

Besides Carnobacterium other genera were detected at lower levels including Clostridium 14 and 8 abattoir A and D respectively and Lactobacillus 7-16 abattoirs A Cand D Lactococcus 16 abattoir C Leuconostoc 9.5 abattoir F. By week-30 Carnobacterium predominated on samples from abattoirs A C and D 77-97 whereas for abattoir F Leuconostoc gelidum 63 and Carnobacterium 29 were the predominant bacteria.UniFrac analysis showed more similarities for striploins among abattoirs compared to cube rolls.

The selec- tion and establishment of the resident bacteria could be further influenced by different processing protocols adopted in each abattoir such as hot-water pasteurization of final carcasses prior to chilling at abattoir C and D. Once established these abattoir microbiomes act as source of inoculum for subsequent production batches  .The differences among abattoirs were both qualitative i.e.

The lowest diversity was observed at abattoir F. Striploins showed greater bacterial diversity compared to cube rolls and diversity decreased with storage time data not shown.Relationship between meat sensory quality parameters and TRFsThe DISTLM analysis showed that relationships among sensory attributes and bacterial TRFs were significant  with positive correlations P  0.01 observed between TRFs and vacuum integrity confinement odour and intact pack appearance.

No correlation with post bloom appearance was observed.Community structure of VP cube rolls over 30 weeksThe 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis showed that initial bacterial communities on cube rolls from different abattoirs were generally dominated by members of classes Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria except for abattoir F where members of Firmicutes predominated 86 from the outset Supplementary Table S1.

Thereafter packaging conditions storage temperature and interactions among different microbes can exert selection pressure affecting the subsequent development of meat bacterial community structure as well as determining bacterial growth kinetics and rates of meat spoilage.

As storage progressed changes in bacterial community structure occurred resulting in sensorial dete- rioration of the meat.TRFLP analysis showed that bacterial communities on beef primals produced at six abattoirs were different.

A Bonferroni-corrected P value of  0.05 was considered significantly different however results showed that P values for other abattoir comparisons were 0.06 and thus could be designated suggestively different.

The plot showed distinct grouping of VP meat samples by abattoir with the first canonical axis separating abattoirs B E and F from abattoirs A and C while the second axis separated abattoir D from abattoirs A B C and F. Differences among abattoirs changed over a period of 30 weeks.

For abattoir C at 0 week and abattoir F at 16 weeks the strongest similarity was between striploin and cube roll samples P  1.
