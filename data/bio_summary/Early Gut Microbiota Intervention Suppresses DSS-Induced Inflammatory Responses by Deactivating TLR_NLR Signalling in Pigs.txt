G-J Percentage of Prevotella Treponema Fibrobacter and Lactobacillus in the faeces of Yorkshire and Tibetan pigs each n  5 in the classification of genus.gene transcripts were considerably higher in the Yorkshire pigs than in the Tibetan pigs.

We tracked the downstream regulators of TLRNLR signalling the results showed that the NF-kB mRNA level detected in the colons of the Tibetan pigs was lower than that detected in the Yorkshire pigs but we only observed a trend for higher MYD88 expression in the Yorkshire pigs P  0.09.Part II Effect of the symbiotic bacteria intervention on immune traits and resistance to colitis induction.

The pigs were segregated from their mothers immediately after birth surface-sterilized and randomly allotted to 4 groups matched for body weight and gender as follows Groups G 1 and G2 received a faecal suspension from the Yorkshire pigs and G3 and G4 received a faecal suspension from the Tibetan pigs.

Taken together the Tibetan pigs are more likely to have healthier microbiota communities compared to the Yorkshire pigs.However surprisingly the proportion of spirochaetes in the faeces of the Tibetan pigs was more than triple the proportion in the Yorkshire pig faeces.

The Yorkshire pigs showed higher intestinal levels of the measured pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a IL-1b IL-6 and IL-17 than the Tibetan pigs Fig.

We demonstrated in the present study that the expression levels of NF-kB and some of the NLRs and TLRs as well as the levels of several downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines were lower in the guts of the Tibetan pigs than in the Yorkshire pigs.

To evaluate the potential benefits of supplementation with the bacteria in an inflammatory model DSS was orally administered to two groups of pigs that received the faecal matter of Yorkshire and Tibetan pigs.

By contrast the Tibetan strain is a domestic pig that is mainly distributed in the Tibetan highlands and has striking phenotypic and physiological differences from lowland pigs that have allowed them to adapt to the extreme conditions.

However these immunological characteristics of the Tibetan pigs were not reflected in the piglets that received their faecal microbiota instead the NOD12 signalling of the recipients was activated by the Tibetan microbiota.

These results indicate that pigs inoculated with the Tibetan microbiota acquired relatively strong resistance to experimental colitis suggesting that the genotype of the host contributes to the uniqueness of its intestinal microbial community whereas the microbiota plays a vital role in programming the immune phenotypes of the host.Shaped by evolution over millions of years some symbiotic bacteria have developed beneficial relationships with their hosts by creating a mutualistic environment in which the microbiota contributes to many host physiological processes and in turn is provided with essential conditions for survival by the host .
