We hypoth- esized that there would be a distinct taxonomic and functional soil community for each precipitation zone with arid environ- ments having lower taxonomic and functional diversity great- er relative abundance of stress response and sporulation- related genes and lower relative abundance of genes related to nutrient cycling and degradation of complex organic com- pounds.

The shotgun metagenomic sequence data used in this study are deposited in the MG-RAST server under project ID 10865 .Statistical AnalysisThe taxonomic and functional diversity Shannon index were calculated from M5NR taxonomic species level and SEED subsystem functional level 3 profiles respectively.

While many soils have been analyzed from the point of view of functional gene profiles  - there has been little study of trends in metagenome structure and function along precipitation gra- dients.

This is based upon observa- tions of soils from precipitation gradients around the world which often show differences in taxonomic com- munity composition  .That there will be lower taxonomic and functional diver- sity arid environments.

All the environmental variables were included in the RDA analysis.To test the effect of precipitation gradient on taxonomic and functional diversity we used ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD post hoc test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction P  0.05 in R software .

However of the measured environmental variables only MAP significantly influenced the taxonomic pseudo-F  8.6 P  0.02 and functional pseudo-F  8.8 P  0.02 community composition of soil microbiome along the precipitation gradient Fig.

However functional diversity varied significantly P  0.05 among sites along the precipitation gradient with arid and Mediterranean sites having significantly lower func- tional diversity than semiarid and humid Mediterranean sites all P  0.05 Fig.
