The nonidentical shared genes generally have high sequence identity 99 and include genes for hydrogenase 2 transposases transporters and multiple proteins with unknown functions indicating that the genomes diverged little from one another and that differences consist of only a small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms.Central metabolism.

We detected genes for a putative trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase EC 1.7.2.3 for the reduction of trimethylamine-N-oxide TMAO into trimethylamine TMA which may serve as a trophic link to methylotrophic methanogens in the gut that use methylated amino compounds like TMA in conjunction with H2 during methanogenesis .Secretome and putative interaction genes.

In addition we detected hemolysin-3 a putative colicin V production protein   and seven genes encoding putative 13-lactamases EC 3.5.2.6.Putative horizontally transferred genes.

No homologs of M. schaedleri genes belonging to the T6SS are present in other Deferribacteres genomes and nearly all genes share a node in their phylogenetic trees with just Campylobacter andor Helicobacter Fig.

In total reads mapped to 851 genes 37 of predicted genes in the genome.

Transcripts from 2015 genes 87 of all genes were detected in the RNA sequencing RNA-seq libraries.

Transcripts from 2036 genes 89 of all genes were detected overall.

More than half of the genes in the M. schaedleri genome were putative interphylum-transferred genes which is much greater than the percentage of other abundant gut bacteria transferred.

We also identified genes expressed by M. schaedleri in vivo using newly generated and previously published metatranscriptomic data from gnotobiotic and conventional mice.

The assembled genomes of variants MCS and AYGZ have 36 and 39 contigs respectively and were estimated to be largely complete based on detection of a complete set of tRNAs and conserved housekeeping genes see Table S1 in the supplemental material.
