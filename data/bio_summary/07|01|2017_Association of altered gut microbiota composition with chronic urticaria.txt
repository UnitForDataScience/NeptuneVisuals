The mean of the relative amounts of Enterobacteriaceae family in the stool samples from patients with CU was more than that of healthy controls however the difference was nearly significant P 14 .12.Conclusion The results reveal a change of frequency and relative amounts of A muciniphila C leptum and Fprausnitzii in patients with CU compared with healthy controls.

The relative amounts of Akkermansia muciniphila in the fecal microbiota of patients with chronic urticaria CU and healthy controls the bacterial relative amounts were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in positive stool samples by the method explained in the text.

The relative amounts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the fecal microbiota of patients with chronic urticaria CU and healthy controls the bacterial relative amounts were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in positive stool samples by the method explained in the text.

However the relative amounts of the Enterobacteriaceaefamily in the stool samples from patients with CU were more than those of healthy controls.The frequency and relative amounts of A muciniphila C leptum and F prausnitzii in healthy controls were significantly more than those of patients with CU which is in line with the findings of previous studies.

The relative amounts of Clostridium leptum in the fecal microbiota of patients with chronic urticaria CU and healthy controls the bacterial relative amounts were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in positive stool samples by the method explained in the text.

The relative amounts of the Enterobacteriaceae family in the fecal microbiota of patients with chronic urticaria CU and healthy controls the bacterial relative amounts were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in positive stool samples by the method explained in the text.

This finding is in agreement with studies that reported a nonprotective or antiprotective role for the Enterobacteriaceae family against eczema inflammatory bowel disease food allergy and atopy.eThis finding can be explained by the fact that the Enterobacteriaceae family members are among proinflammatory members of gut microbiota.Decrease in the frequency and the relative amounts of A muci- niphila C leptum and F prausnitzii and increase of the relative amounts of the Enterobacteriaceae family in patients with CU compared with healthy controls were observed.

The mean relative amount of the Enterobacteriaceae family in the stool samples from the patients with CU was more than that of healthy controls but the difference was almost significant P 14 .12 .DiscussionThe results of this study indicate that the frequencies of A muciniphila C leptum and F prausnitzii in healthy controls' stool samples were significantly more than in patients with CU whereas the Enterobacteriaceae family was detected in the stool samples of all patients and healthy controls.

DNA-free water was used as a negative control.The comparative CT method was used to determine bacterial rela- tive amount in each sample through calculating 2-DDCt.Statistical AnalysisFrequencies and relative amounts of the bacteria were compared between two groups using the Mann-Whitney test and independent sample t test respectively.ResultsThere were no significant differences between the 20 patients with CU and the 20 healthy controls with respect to mean SD age 37.7 3.46 years in patients with CU and 37.55 3.55 years in healthy controls P  .99 and sex 8 men and 12 women in each group P .98.

There was an increase P 14 .08 in the mean relative amount of F prausnitzii in the positive samples of health controls compared with patients with CU.relative amounts of C leptum in the positive samples of healthy controls compared with patients with CU .
