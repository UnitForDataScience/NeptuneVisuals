the mean relative amount of the enterobacteriaceae family in the stool samples from the patients with cu was more than that of healthy controls but the difference was almost significant p 14 .12 .discussionthe results of this study indicate that the frequencies of a muciniphila c leptum and f prausnitzii in healthy controls' stool samples were significantly more than in patients with cu whereas the enterobacteriaceae family was detected in the stool samples of all patients and healthy controls.

the mean of the relative amounts of enterobacteriaceae family in the stool samples from patients with cu was more than that of healthy controls however the difference was nearly significant p 14 .12.conclusion the results reveal a change of frequency and relative amounts of a muciniphila c leptum and fprausnitzii in patients with cu compared with healthy controls.

the frequencies of a muciniphila c leptum and f prausnitzii in the stool samples of healthy controls were significantly more than those of patients with cu p  .001 p  .01 and p  .05 respectively whereas the enterobacteriaceae family were detected in the stool samples of all patients and healthy controls.figure 3. the relative amounts of akkermansia muciniphila in the fecal microbiota of patients with chronic urticaria cu and healthy controls the bacterial relative amounts were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in positive stool samples by the method explained in the text.

there was an increase p 14 .08 in the mean relative amount of f prausnitzii in the positive samples of health controls compared with patients with cu.relative amounts of c leptum in the positive samples of healthy controls compared with patients with cu .

some other mechanisms such as improvement of gut barrier func- tion and increased production of butyrate may be considered as well.the current findings indicated no difference between the fre- quency of the enterobacteriaceae family in the patients with cu and the healthy controls but the relative amounts of these bacteria were larger in the patients with cu compared with the healthy controls.

however the relative amounts of the enterobacteriaceaefamily in the stool samples from patients with cu were more than those of healthy controls.the frequency and relative amounts of a muciniphila c leptum and f prausnitzii in healthy controls were significantly more than those of patients with cu which is in line with the findings of previous studies.

this mechanism is in line with studies that found reducedfigure 4. the relative amounts of clostridium leptum in the fecal microbiota of patients with chronic urticaria cu and healthy controls the bacterial relative amounts were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in positive stool samples by the method explained in the text.

this finding is in agreement with studies that reported a nonprotective or antiprotective role for the enterobacteriaceae family against eczema inflammatory bowel disease food allergy and atopy.ethis finding can be explained by the fact that the enterobacteriaceae family members are among proinflammatory members of gut microbiota.decrease in the frequency and the relative amounts of a muci- niphila c leptum and f prausnitzii and increase of the relative amounts of the enterobacteriaceae family in patients with cu compared with healthy controls were observed.

fresh fecal samples were collected and dna extracted from stool samples was analyzed by real- time polymerase chain reaction for the qualitative and quantitative assays of the so-called bacteria.results the frequencies of a muciniphila c leptum and f prausnitzii in healthy controls' stool samples weresignificantly more than those of patients with cu p  .001 p  .01 and p  .05 respectively whereas the enterobacteriaceae family was detected in all patients and healthy controls' stool samples.

the present study aimed to compare the presence and the relative amounts of some members of gut microbiota among patients with cu vs healthy controls.

furthermore there was a corresponding in- crease of relative amounts of c leptum and f prausnitzii in positive samples from healthy controls compared with those of patients with cu.
