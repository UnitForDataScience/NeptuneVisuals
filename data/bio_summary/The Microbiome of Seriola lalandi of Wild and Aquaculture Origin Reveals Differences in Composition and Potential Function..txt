furthermore permanova and anosim tests p  0.05 confirmed the significant differences in the composition of the microbiota depending on the origin of the fish table 1.composition of microbial communitiesthe taxonomic compositions of the s. lalandi intestinal microbiota of wild and aquacultured origin primarily present representatives of the phyla proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria followed by bacteroidetes planctomycetestable 1  comparison of similarities in microbiota composition between wild and aquaculture yellowtail kingfish.7 alphaproteobacteria 5 and betaproteobacteria 3. at the order level the following bacteria were observed in the wild yellowtail samples pseudomonadales 52 alteromonadales 23 actinomycetales 8 vibrionales 5 bacillales 3 and lactobacillales 3 whereas aquacultured yellowtail presented bacillales 34 lactobacillales 20actinomycetales 14 pseudomonadales 10 clostridiales6 and sphingomonadales 4 table s2.differential abundances of the bacterial populations associated with originspecific taxa that were differentially distributed between the wild and aquacultured yellowtail were identified using deseq2 software package.

these match with our results where the s. lalandi microbiota of aquacultured fish under ras was dominated by bacteria of the order bacilales.the differences in relative abundances of the components of the intestinal microbiota of s. lalandi shown in figure 4 indicate that in the case of wild yellowtail the predominant phylum is proteobacteria.

the significant differences in bacterial functionbetween wild and aquacultured yellowtail is detailed in table 3.discussionto our knowledge this is the first study to characterize and compare the intestinal microbiota of wild and aquaculturedcompilations indicate that structure of fish microbiomes could be more similar to the microbiome of their environments than those of mammals in fact previous reports addressing gut microbiota in fish have showed that gut microbiota composition was different from those found in the surrounding environment such as feed or water kormas et al.
