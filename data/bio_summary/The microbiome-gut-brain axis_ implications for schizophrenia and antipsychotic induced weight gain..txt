As such it is possible that the gut microbiome may play a role in SCZ through modulation of the gut- brain axis.The gut microbiome in schizophreniaFew studies have investigated the gut microbiome in rela- tion to SCZ refer to Table .

The following review describes the current link between the gut microbiome in psychiatric disease and examines the evidence for gut microbiome mediated antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction.1 34Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 2018 2683-15on enteric-endocrine cells.

For example sev- eral species of bacterium found within the gut microbi- ome are capable of synthesizing and releasing a number of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators which can actAn overview of the gut microbiome in behavior and psychiatric diseaseSeveral studies have investigated the gut microbiome in relation to temperament behavioral traits and neuropsychi- atric conditions refer to Table .

Patients taking RSP who had significant weight gain during treatment had a higher diversity gut microbiome and fewer Bacteroidetes compared to Firmicutes compared to psychiatric controlsThere were differences in the gut microbiome between RSP treated patients who gained weight compared to those who did notSpecific taxa correlating with weight gain in the RSP group were identified and included Ralstonia Clostridium and members of Erysipelotrichaceae familyEur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 2018 2683-1511appears to have a bidirectional relationship with microbial composition.

Although other mechanisms are likely to also contribute to AP treatmentinduced metabolic disturbances the gut microbiome is a potential target warranting further study as a mechanism of AP-induced weight gain and related metabolic dysfunction.Gut microbiota and metabolic regulation and obesity and diabetesWith the increasing emergence of information regard- ing the human gut microbiome it is becoming clear that this network of bacteria has an important role in human metabolism.

Given the association between changes in gut microbiota weight gain and glu- cose metabolism it is possible that AP-induced metabolic disturbance could be mediated at least partially by chang- ing the composition of the human gut microbiome.Gut microbiome and antipsychotic-induced weight gainA few studies have investigated the impact of AP on the gut microbiome and metabolic side effects in animal mod- els refer to Table .

The gut microbiota has been described in several psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety but only a few reports have discussed the role of the microbiome in schizophrenia.

Beginning its development at birth along with several other physiological systems the human gut microbiome is an important factor in health and dis- ease.
