Germ-free mice that were mono- colonized with each of these strains showed decreased proliferation and increased cell death in the epithelium of the proximal colon compared with non-colonized germ-free mice and germ-free mice monocolonized by Bacteroides fragilis.

Interestingly organoids from Ripk3- knockout mice were also protected from the deleterious effects of the purified LPS which suggests that LPS induces necroptosis.

Finally purified LPS induced differentiation of the organoid epithelial cells towards goblet cells although this effect varied between bacterial strains.The crypt microbiota and the host epithelium interact closely and LPS is one of the key bacterial molecules that regulate epithelial prolifera-tion and differentiation.

No changes wereobserved in Tlr4-knockout mice which indicates that the crypt micro- biota modulates epithelial regeneration through lipopolysaccharide LPS.To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms the authors incubated proximal colon organoids with sonicated preparations of each of the cultured crypt microbiota strains.

LPS that was purified from each ofthe four strains had similar effects.
