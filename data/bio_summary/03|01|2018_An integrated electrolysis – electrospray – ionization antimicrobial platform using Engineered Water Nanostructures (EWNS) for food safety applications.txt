The same experimental setup is used for the production of EWNS DI water used as the fluid and eEWNS water produced by electrolysis used as the fluid.Physicochemical characterization of electrolysis water and eEWNSPhysical characterization of the water produced by electrolysis STEP 1During the electrolysis of water 1 mL samples were collected every 10 min and the conductivity was measured using the Zeta- sizer Malvern Instruments Westborough MA.

Immediately after the exposure berries were asep- tically removed for further analysis to determine E. coli inactivation as described in 2.3.8 below.Exposure of blackberries to eEWNS for natural microbiota inactivationIn parallel to inoculation experiments non-inoculated black- berries were exposed to eEWNS to evaluate natural microbiota inactivation total viable count and yeast and mold count.

There is 0.81 - 0.06 x 10-16 mol of H2O2 contained in each eEWNS particle whereas there is almost no H2O2 in EWNS detected 0.06 - 0.09 10-16 mol H2O2 per particle averaged for the three sampling points.b indicates that the eEWNS produced a stronger O-2 signalthan the EWNS.

The comparison of peak heights for EWNS and eEWNS shows that the concentration of superoxides in eEWNS is doubled that in EWNS p 0.19.

Converting these values to charge shows that the EWNS and eEWNS have similar average charges per particle 14 - 2 e- for EWNS vs. 13 - 2 e- for eEWNS.
