The metagenomic analysis in this study revealed that 1 the decreased diversity of microbiota in patients before FMT was recovered to the level of the donor after FMT and 2 the efficacy of FMT was clearly dependent on the status of increased Actinobacteria phylum especially Bifidobacterium genus in donor feces but not on changes in the composition of patient microbiota before or after FMT.

In recurrent Clostridium difficile infections FMT had a higher cure rate than standard antibiotic treatment 14 and previous reports showed that FMT might restore intestinal microbial balance in human diseases 15.To date few studies have evaluated whether FMT is effective in IBS patients 16.

3b.These results suggest that FMT has a therapeutic effect for IBS patients' psychiatric status irrespective of the presence or absence of stool abnormalities but the effect may not be sustained for 12 weeks.DiscussionThis open-label pilot study demonstrated that FMT for patients with IBS was conducted safe and relatively effective 6 of 10 patients recovered to types 3-4 of stool score at 4 weeks after FMT.

Surprisingly we also found that FMT significantly improved the psychological status after FMT irrespective of IBS responders and non-responders.This is the first study to analyze the composition of intestinal microbiota in donors and patients and the change in microbiota composition before and after FMT in IBS patients.

The therapeutic effect of FMT on patients with psychological disorders was sustained for a limited time up to 4 weeks after FMT and the abundance of Bifidobacterium tended to decrease from 4 to 12 weeks after FMT online suppl.

a HAM-D score of patients at baseline and at 4 and 12 weeks after FMT in 8 patients left in responders n  5 and right non-responders n  3. b HAM-A score of patients at baseline and at 4 and 12 weeks after FMT in 8 patients left responders n  5 and right non-responders n  3. c Gastrointestinal symptoms evaluated in HAM-A of patients at baseline and 12 weeks after FMT in 8 patients left responders n  5 and right non-responders n  3.

The diversity of patients 4 weeks after FMT increased significantly compared with patients before FMT and that of responding patients was significantly higher than non-responder patients.

To clarify the efficacy of FMT in Japanese patients with IBS we performed a single-arm open-label non-randomized study of FMT with metagenomic and psychological analyses.Materials and MethodsEthicsThe Ethics Committee at Keio University School of Medicine approved the protocol 20130488 and all participants provided written informed consent.

The study procedure is shown in Figure .Fecal Sample CollectionFecal samples were longitudinally collected from patients at weeks 0 4 and 12 after FMT and from donors on the day of FMT.

The number of enrolled patient was small but sufficient for the first registered trial to evaluate the efficacy of FMT in addition to the safety profile in IBS patients.In this study we attempted to extend the application of FMT for intractable intestinal diseases.
