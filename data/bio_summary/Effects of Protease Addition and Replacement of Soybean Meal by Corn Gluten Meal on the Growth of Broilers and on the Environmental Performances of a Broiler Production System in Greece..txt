Therefore future LCA research should be focused on detecting and handling uncertainty issues regarding the environmental impacts of Greek broiler production processes in order to statistically support comparisons between the systems defined for different broiler diets.The maintenance of the broilers' growth performance body weight feed intake and FCR meat quality feed cost per kg weight gain and gut integrity the positive effect on the intestinal microflora and the potential reduction in the majority of the environmental impacts could all be considered as positive indications in the effort to sustainably replace the conventional soy- bean-dependent Control diet in the specific broiler production system.

Comparing the feed cost of Control group vs Soy-Prot group it can be concluded that the inclusion of protease actually decreased the feed cost per kg compared to a standard feed because the additional cost of the enzyme was compensated by the reduction of total crude protein in the feed.

More research is required in order to identify alternative broiler diets with positive effects on broilers' health and growth characteristics the system's economic performance the broiler meat quality char- acteristics and all the EICIs thus towards more sustainable Greek broiler production systems.Supporting InformationS1 Table.

In addition Leinonen and Wil- liams estimated the GWP100 the AP and the EP in two broiler production systems defined by a soybean-based diet and by an equivalent diet supplemented with the protease Rono- zyme1 ProAct whose basic ingredients were wheat increased by 5 corn kept constant soybean 48 reduced by 9.6 rapeseed meal kept constant and soybean oil reduced by 9.

However the broilers which were fed the Gluten-Prot diet at the end of the trial showed a tendency P 0.010 for lower weight gain and feed intake compared to those of the Control diet.

showed that the application of a diet in broilers in which soybeans are partly replaced with beans peas and sunflower meal all of European origin reduced up to 8 the GWP100 in all cases except for the sunflower-based diet the AP up to 14.5 and the EP up to 2.5 compared to a soybean-based diet.

Furthermore in the work of Leinonen and Williams  LCA was applied to examine the effect of adding the protease Ronozyme1 ProAct in different broiler diets with reduced content of soybean-based products on a number of environmental impact categories for a standard UK broiler production system.
