therefore future lca research should be focused on detecting and handling uncertainty issues regarding the environmental impacts of greek broiler production processes in order to statistically support comparisons between the systems defined for different broiler diets.the maintenance of the broilers' growth performance body weight feed intake and fcr meat quality feed cost per kg weight gain and gut integrity the positive effect on the intestinal microflora and the potential reduction in the majority of the environmental impacts could all be considered as positive indications in the effort to sustainably replace the conventional soy- bean-dependent control diet in the specific broiler production system.

in addition leinonen and wil- liams estimated the gwp100 the ap and the ep in two broiler production systems defined by a soybean-based diet and by an equivalent diet supplemented with the protease rono- zyme1 proact whose basic ingredients were wheat increased by 5 corn kept constant soybean 48 reduced by 9.6 rapeseed meal kept constant and soybean oil reduced by 9. the maximum reductions compared to the soybean-based diet were estimated 4 7 and 9 for gwp100 ep and ap respectively.the present study focused on the environmental impacts of a broiler production system for three diets that have not been examined in the literature.

more research is required in order to identify alternative broiler diets with positive effects on broilers' health and growth characteristics the system's economic performance the broiler meat quality char- acteristics and all the eicis thus towards more sustainable greek broiler production systems.supporting informations1 table.

furthermore in the work of leinonen and williams  lca was applied to examine the effect of adding the protease ronozyme1 proact in different broiler diets with reduced content of soybean-based products on a number of environmental impact categories for a standard uk broiler production system.

the interest of the poultry industry to use lca for the evaluation of environmental impacts of poultry production processes has also become apparent after the publication of the document greenhouse gas emissions and fossil energy use from poultry supply chains guidelines for assessment from the recently estab- lished livestock environmental assessment and performance partnership leap under the coordination of fao .several authors have attempted to apply the lca methodology in the broiler supply chain -.

an lca approach was finally adopted in order to evaluate the potential environmental performance of the broiler production systems corresponding to the alternative experimental diets and identify their environmental hot-spots.materials and methodsethics statementthis study was carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines of council directive 86609eec regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.

is the only study found in the literature using lca to compare the environmental impacts of broiler production systems defined for alternative to soybean protein sources in the broilers' diet.

these two studies examined broiler diet systems in which soybean meal were slightly decreased and digestibility increasing enzymes were added.environmental hot-spots and differences in the environmental performance.

showed that the application of a diet in broilers in which soybeans are partly replaced with beans peas and sunflower meal all of european origin reduced up to 8 the gwp100 in all cases except for the sunflower-based diet the ap up to 14.5 and the ep up to 2.5 compared to a soybean-based diet.

all other chemicals were purchased from sigma-aldrich chemical co.birds housing and managementa growth experiment was performed in a broiler house of commercial broiler farm in basilika latitude 4048 longitude 2314 height 69 m greece.

the electricity and the heat consumption were esti- mated 0.1021 and 0.3086 kwh per kg of produced broiler respectively.emissions of gases from the broiler house but also from the litter piles were also taken into account in the analysis.

the transport transport distances to the broiler farm.1all domestic distances are estimated by having taken into account the average distances between possible realistic production sites and the broiler farm.
