seasonal variation influences and is influenced by not only rainfall patterns and availability of resources hart  hart 1986 speth  spielmann 1983 ulijaszek  strickland 2009 but also diet composition altman 1984 kitanishi 1995 speth widdowson oftedal foley  van soest 1991 and food sharingspeth 1990 group composition and residence patterns thompson 1939 woodburn 1968 work-load hurtado  hill 1990 sleeping patterns ingram  dauncey 2009 samson  nunn 2015 and even ritualistic behaviors ulijaszek 2009. despite this acknowledgement most discussions of forager diet overlook seasonal variation see dis- cussion by hurtado  hill 1990. the imperative point is for anthropol- ogists collecting nutritional data among foragers to consider theimportance of seasonality when collecting data in the field--and to attempt to address any seasonal variation when using summative data from the literature.

the criteria for categorizing a foraging popula- tion based on diet composition shifted to mean that approximately 10-15 of the diet came from domesticated foods kelly 1995. today in the 21st century if we were to use the criteria that foraging popula- tions must consume a diet of over 90 wild foraged foods no popula- tion would meet the designation apicella  crittenden 2015. it istherefore important for current investigators to acknowledge that in the 21st century almost all foraging populations consume a mixed-diet that includes varying degrees of farmed foods wild foods and possibly nutritional subsidies from governments and aid organizations head- land  blood 2002.beyond diet composition anthropologists are wont to classify for- agers using varied measures.

2000 683. as there is no consistency in the units of measurement for each population some have argued that reliance on the atlas compendium of forager data may be debatable from the outset milton 2000. fur- thermore even if we take the starting point of weight grams of food and assume that most studies in the atlas used this unit of measure- ment there is no clear indication of how successive authors may select which categories of food to include in their summary andor how authors may go from field weight grams to energy for each specific food.
