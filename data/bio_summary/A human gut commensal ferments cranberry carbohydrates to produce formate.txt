infantis JCM1272 achieved moderate growth on A2 OD600 of 0.17 - 0.08 whereas growth on purified xyloglucans was not observed.In contrast the more purified A6 fraction was utilized only by B. longum subsp.longum UCD401 and B. longum subsp.

The strains used in this study have been previously confirmed by multilocus sequence typing and urease assay to distinguish B. infantis and B. longum urease and urease- .

This study tested the hypothesis that B. longum utilizes cranberry-derived xyloglucans in a strain-dependent manner.

Interestingly the B. longum strain that efficiently utilizes cranberry xyloglucans secretes 2.0 to 2.5 mol of acetate-lactate.
