Reads are classified into taxonomic categories using bioinformatic algorithms that operate in a sequential manner to I trim bases from the edges of the sequence reads that have been flagged as low-quality or less informative by the sequencing platformII stitch paired reads together into one contiguous read contigs if the target DNA of interest was sequenced in two segments also called paired-end sequencing or construct several contigs if shotgun sequencing was performed III remove sequencing artefacts such as chimeras which consist of merged sequences from two distinct organisms inadvertently spliced together at the PCR stage IV in the case of 16S profiling filter out non-16S DNA by comparison with reference databases and V assign taxonomic identities to the sequences in a probabilistic manner by comparing the sequences or gene- content in case of shotgun sequencing to those present in reference databases.

Study design and statistical analyses in translational microbiome studiesvariability of sequence reads across samples.While the number of sequencing reads per sample depends on the body site being studied as well as the number of samples pooled in a given sequencing run studies typically aim for a sequencing depth that saturates the rarefaction curve for the sequencing platform.

By sequencing these controls in each sequencing plate and run and examining the resulting reads investigators can ensure that their amplification sequencing and taxonomic classification protocols have not introduced substantial bias or distortions in the expected microbiome profiles.While the inclusion of controls in the sample processing workflows can help monitor for contamination and correct for sequencing-related skews HTS platforms come with their own share of challenges embedded in data generation 6465.

This review builds on these discussions while specifically focusing on the design of translational microbiome studies and development of downstream statistical analysis plans which answer complex questions in a translational setting and inform early and late-phase clinical trials.Making informed decisions study designBecause studies cannot include entire populations it is crucial to define the target population of interest and then draw a representative study sample to ensure that the findings from the study are generalizable 48.

Samples retrieved from a biorepository might not be uniformly separated in time an aspect that needs to be accounted for while interpreting study findings.Annals of Translational Medicine Vol 5 No 12 June 2017Page 3 of 11While understanding the microbiome might be the central focus of the study concurrent clinical laboratory and omics measurements from the study play a crucial role in expanding the scope of microbiome-related findings by placing them in the context of disease pathways and pathological mechanisms.

number of measured microbes is far greater than the number of study subjects it is advantageous at the exploratory stage to plot summary measures that represent the state of the microbiome such as the Shannon 88 or the inverse Simpson 89 diversity index rather than visualize each microbe one at a time.The complexity of questions in a translational study makes it unlikely that a single statistical model would adequately answer all facets of the study question.

Advantages and limitations of 16S profiling and whole-genome sequencing the two primary techniques for measuring the microbiome are discussed followed by an overview of bioinformatic processing of high-throughput sequencing data from these measurements.

The most distinct advantage of metagenomic sequencing is the ability to use the sequencing reads to construct a catalog of genes in a sample and use this information to arrive at species and strain-level identification 56.

The drawbacks of metagenomic sequencing stem from its substantial cost which increases with the depth of sequencing and the number of samples.

Inspecting the PCR bands from the E. coli samples and the subsequent sequencing reads verifies whether the PCR amplification and the sequencing steps target both the expected organisms and the expected size of fragments of the 16S gene and additionally yield the desired number of reads of these organisms.
