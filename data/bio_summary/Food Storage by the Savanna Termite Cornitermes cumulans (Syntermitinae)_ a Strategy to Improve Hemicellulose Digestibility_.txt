In Brazil C. cumulans is considered a keystone spe- cies because it is the most abundant mound-building termite in savannas and their nests promote the colonization by other organisms .Here we conduct for the first time a detailed study of the microbial communities associated to a termite exhibiting food storage behavior using Illumina sequencing of the 16S and the internal transcribed spacer ITS regions of rDNA genes to- gether with enzymatic assays and data collected in the field.First we evaluated food storage by C. cumulans in the field.

Together with C. cumulans the selected species included another termite that stores food inside the nest.MethodsTermites and Study SiteCornitermes cumulans Kollar 1982 Procornitermes sp.

Additionally the presence of stored food may be cyclic and further work will be needed to elucidate if nodules of C. cumulans are present seasonally or during high colony demand.Although we did not observe the feeding behavior of C. cumulans under natural conditions the survival of workers in the laboratory was higher when food nodules were offered over other plant substrates Costa-Leonardo unpublished suggesting that C. cumulans may benefit from specific nutri- ents or chemicals that result from the alteration of stored plant material inside the nodules.

In some termite species plant material is usually stored in cells or chambers inside the nest  however workers of C. cumulans cut small pieces of plant litter and packed them with their feces against the internal nest walls forming peculiar nodules that resemble those reported for two Nasutitermes species Nasutitermitinae .

Nocardioides Actinobacteria was the most abun- dant genus in the food stored by C. cumulans and the nest walls of C. cumulans Procornitermes sp.

In order to verify whether the enzymatic ac- tivity is characteristic for C. cumulans we compared to pat- terns in other termite species that store and do not store food.

Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum in nest walls of all termite species and in the food nodules of C. cumulans.

Classification using the DictDb and Warcup databases successfully assigned 100 and 97.7 of the bacterial and fungal reads at the phylum level decreasing with taxonomic depth Tables S2 and S3.Gut Microbial Assemblages of C. cumulans Are Represented by Abundant Spirochaetesand PleosporalesGut samples of workers and soldiers of C. cumulans yielded 23 bacterial phyla representing 98 families 130 genera and 1539 OTUs Table S2.

The group Treponema Spirochaetes subclusters Ia and Ic was the most abundant genus in C. cumulans Velocitermes sp.
