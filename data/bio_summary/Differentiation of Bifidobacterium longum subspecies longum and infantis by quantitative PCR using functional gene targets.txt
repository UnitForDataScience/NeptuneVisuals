The prevalence of subspecies infantis tended to be less than that of subspecies longum and was mainly influenced by the age of the child rather than nutrition only two infants less than one week of age had detectable levels 0.05 relative abundance of subspecies infantis.In general subspecies infantis was present in low abundance in infant feces compared to B. longum subsp.

Extracted gDNA was used as template in separate qPCR reactions including the universal 16S rRNA gene primers to determinetotal community target quantity and each of the B. longum subspecies TaqmanQRassayprimerprobe sets to determine target quantity for each B. longum subspecies.

longum sugar kinase gene locus tag 'BL0274' from strain NCC 2705.Designed primers were checked for target specificity in-silico using Primer-BLAST  against the NCBI nr database and showed absence of predicted cross reactivity with non-target templates.Reaction specificity and efficiency was tested by generating ten-fold serial dilutions of both B. longum subspecies longum and B. longum subspecies infantis gDNA so that reactions would contain between 5x 106 and 5x 101 genomesreaction.

This might be unexpected especially in the case of breast milk-fed infants where the specialized HMO metabolism of subspecies infantis could favor proliferation of this subspecies over subspecies longum .Investigations of the infant bowel microbiota in terms of comparative bacterial growth using available substrates and resource partitioning in the community are required to provide ecological explanations of bifidobacterial relative abundances.The evolutionary importance of the infant-bifidobacteria paradigm remains speculative but may involve competitive exclusion of pathogens andor support of infant nutrition    .

Dif- ferentiation of B. longum into subspecies has been carried out in relatively few quantitative studies of the infant fecal microbiota so that subspecies prevalence and relative abundances are not accurately known on a global scale   .

Other groups have used 16S rRNA gene primers  16S23S intergenic region primers  23S rRNA gene primers  and tuf gene primers  to differentiate the subspecies but a high degree of similarity be- tween sequences of marker genes such as the 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene leads to difficulty in generating PCR primers that are capable of absolute discrimination of the B. longum subspecies .

If a B. longum subspecies assay was positive the sample was assumed to be positive for this subspecies.

Results indicated that extraction methodology would have a negligible impact on the detection of the B. longum subspecies  but nevertheless argue for a standard extraction method to be used in all studies.Prevalence and relative abundances of subspecies longum andinfantis in fecesB.

However B. longum is composed of three subspecies two of which are rep- resented in the bowel microbiota B. longum subsp.
