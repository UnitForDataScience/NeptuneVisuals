The principal coordinates analysis of weighted UniFrac distances showed a 34 of variability between paired fecal and tissue samples P 0.001 indicating a distinct microbiota composition in mucosa compared with feces figure S1 None of these gross community metrics significantly differed in patients with AIN LSIL or HSIL table S1 Prevotella was the most abundant genus in mucosa and feces figure S2 To investigate whether specific bacteria might serve as biomarkers of AIN we first used the LEfSe biomarker discovery tool Fig.

Participants were asymptomatic study participants undergoing screening for anal HPV- associated lesions with anal cytology HRA and biopsy of acetowhite lugol-negative lesions or blindly if no lesions were identified.

In feces however only Ruminococcus showed an adequate AUCROC indicating that the mucosal-adherent micro- biota might be preferable to the fecal microbiota for future studies in this field.In summary components of the fecal and rectal microbiota are able to predict the presence of precancer- ous anal lesions.

A member of the Lachnospiraceae family Catenibacterium which has been defined as a component of the HIV- associated microbiota 12 was also here a biomarker of HSIL.In keeping with the findings in mucosa Ruminococcus a genus which appears to be a central component of the healthy microbiota 812 was found in feces predictive of HSIL.

For reasons that are poorly under- stood HIV infection facilitates persistence of mucosal human papillomavirus HPV and increases both the risk of anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia AIN and the progression from low-grade LSIL to high-grade intraepithelial lesions HSIL.

Study participants were classified according to the presence of histologic lesions HSIL N 14 LSIL N 13 and normal N 15 of whom the bacterial 16SrRNA gene could be amplified in tissue in 10 eight and five study participants respectively.

Biomarkers of precancerous anal lesions in feces and rectal mucosa using LEfSe analysis in study participants.

These bacteria could be exploited as diagnostic tools for the screening of precancerous anal lesions in HIV-infected MSM and might eventually become targets for interventions.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to particularly thank the study participants for their commitment to participate in research studies.
