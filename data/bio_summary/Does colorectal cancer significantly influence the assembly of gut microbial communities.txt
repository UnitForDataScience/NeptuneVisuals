no significant difference in the number of the samples satisfying the neutral null model was detected between the healthy individuals and crc patients suggesting that the nature or mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome is not significantly influenced by crc.

second regardless of the success of failure of the neutrality test by using the biodiversity parameter from the neutral theory model we hope to shed light on resolving the issue whether or not crc progression is associated with the composition change of the gut microbiome of which existing studies have presented conflicting evidences.materials and methodsdataset descriptionforty-six gut microbiome samples from patients with crc and fifty-six gut microbiome samples from healthy individuals were pyro-sequenced successfully by  and the raw data generated by their sequencing operations were downloaded from the short reads archive accession number .

our recalculated dataset was then divided into 2 groups the crc group the samples from crc patients and the control group the samples from healthy individuals.the computational procedure for the neutrality testwe used two sampling formulae proposed by and respectively to test the fitting of neutral theory model to the gut microbiome dataset.

described different gut microbiota structure patterns in the crc patients compared to healthy individuals and found a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients.

studied the gut microbiota of crc patients and healthy individuals and developed an improved screening tool for crc that integrated the microbiota data and known clinical risk factors.

further evidence to resolve the existing inconsistency is also worthy of pursuing.even though the change of gut microbiota has been recognized being closely related to the progression of crc to the best of our knowledge the ecological question of whether the force that shapes gut microbiota is associated with crc is still poorly understood.

this explains the difference in the biodiversity parameter th  we observed between the healthy and crc treatments.to the best of our knowledge our study is the first attempt to explore the mechanism of the assembly and diversity maintenance of gut microbiota in crc patients and to make comparisons between the healthy and diseased treatments.

to address this question we applied hubbell's neutral theory for biodiversity to reanalyze the dataset from 's  study of the gut microbiome sampled from 46 crc patients and 56 healthy individuals.

firstly our analysis demonstrated that only around 4 4102 samples in total of both the crc and control groups have their species abundance distribution sad satisfied the prediction of the neutral theory null model.

this postulation is supported by our second finding the diversity of the gut microbiome in crc patients is significantly lower than that in the healthy individuals as demonstrated by the fundamental diversity parameter th  of the neutral theory model.

in addition neutral theory provides an alternativeapproach to assessing biodiversity to the traditional diversity indexes   which allows us to draw evidence helpful for resolving the conflicting results in existing studies regarding the relationship between community diversity and crc progression.

for these merits we apply the neutral theory to comparatively explore the mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance in the gut microbiota in both crc patients and healthy individuals.methodologically in this study we used two sampling formulae models that are widely used to test the neutrality and proposed by and  respectively to reanalyze the dataset originally reported by .

in the crc group 6.5 346 satisfied the neutral prediction and in the control healthy group 1.8 156 samples satisfied.
