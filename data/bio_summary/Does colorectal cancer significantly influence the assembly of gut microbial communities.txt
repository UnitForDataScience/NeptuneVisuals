described different gut microbiota structure patterns in the CRC patients compared to healthy individuals and found a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients.

studied the gut microbiota of CRC patients and healthy individuals and developed an improved screening tool for CRC that integrated the microbiota data and known clinical risk factors.

Further evidence to resolve the existing inconsistency is also worthy of pursuing.Even though the change of gut microbiota has been recognized being closely related to the progression of CRC to the best of our knowledge the ecological question of whether the force that shapes gut microbiota is associated with CRC is still poorly understood.

These studies suggest that it is important to draw a big picture for describing the composition of the gut microbiota of CRC patients and compare it with the normal gut microbiota of the healthy individuals through which not only the specific opportunistic pathogens could be identified but also the global view of the change of microbiota could be determined.

If the null model of neutral theory fits the SAD of gut microbiota then we conclude that the neutral forces stochasticity in survival reproduction and migration govern the assembly of the microbiota.

No significant difference in the number of the samples satisfying the neutral null model was detected between the healthy individuals and CRC patients suggesting that the nature or mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome is not significantly influenced by CRC.

Second regardless of the success of failure of the neutrality test by using the biodiversity parameter from the neutral theory model we hope to shed light on resolving the issue whether or not CRC progression is associated with the composition change of the gut microbiome of which existing studies have presented conflicting evidences.MATERIALS AND METHODSDataset descriptionForty-six gut microbiome samples from patients with CRC and fifty-six gut microbiome samples from healthy individuals were pyro-sequenced successfully by  and the raw data generated by their sequencing operations were downloaded from the Short Reads Archive accession number .

Our recalculated dataset was then divided into 2 groups the CRC group the samples from CRC patients and the control group the samples from healthy individuals.The computational procedure for the neutrality testWe used two sampling formulae proposed by and respectively to test the fitting of neutral theory model to the gut microbiome dataset.

This explains the difference in the biodiversity parameter th  we observed between the healthy and CRC treatments.To the best of our knowledge our study is the first attempt to explore the mechanism of the assembly and diversity maintenance of gut microbiota in CRC patients and to make comparisons between the healthy and diseased treatments.

For these merits we apply the neutral theory to comparatively explore the mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance in the gut microbiota in both CRC patients and healthy individuals.Methodologically in this study we used two sampling formulae models that are widely used to test the neutrality and proposed by and  respectively to reanalyze the dataset originally reported by .
