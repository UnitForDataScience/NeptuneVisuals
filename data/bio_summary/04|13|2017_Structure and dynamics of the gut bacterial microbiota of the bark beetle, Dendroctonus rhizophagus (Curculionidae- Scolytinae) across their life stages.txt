However to obtain a broader and more complete knowledge of the a and ss diversity as well as the community structure it is possible to use approaches based on high-throughput sequencing which have a better statisti- cal power than conventional methods independently of their potential systematic biases inher- ent to samples processing amplification and pyrosequencing that may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of diversity metrics .In bark beetles these approaches have been used to characterize bacterial and fungal symbi- onts in field larvae and adults and lab-rearing insects of Dendroctonus micans D. punctatus and D. valens  to characterize and compare the bacterial microbiome associated with the surface of cuticle interior of the body and galleries from the eastern larch beetle D. simplex  to evaluate whether the exclusivity of the bacterial community in host trees is attributable to the red turpentine beetle D. valens  and to characterize the bacterial community meta- genome associated with the mountain pine beetle D. ponderosae as well as to identify bacterial genes putatively involved in terpene degradation .Given that phloem consumption is different among distinct developmental stages in Den- droctonus species and the nutritional quality of this substrate vary after the initial colonization of the host we analyzed the a and ss diversity of the bacterial community in the gut of D. rhizo- phagus to determine a the change on the bacterial community structure across the insect life cycle b the exclusivity degree of community in different life stages c the persistence of the dominant taxa and d the predictive functional profile of the community using 16S rRNA sequences.Materials and methodsInsect collection dissection and DNA extractionLarvae 5th instar pupae teneral pre-emerged adults and emerged adults were collected from naturally infested Arizona pines 60 cm high 10 cm diam.

Unfortunately it has been difficult to determine whether these differences are consistent because these last studies did not systematically ana- lyze the community across different developmental stages with exception of D. armandi where differences in the community structure were observed through several life stages .The PCoA analysis using unweighted UniFrac distances indicates that b-diversity is statisti- cally significant among bacterial communities in the different life stages and replicates how- ever the same analysis using weighted UniFrac distances did not show significant differences.

The expected richness metric Chao 1 was significantly different Richness and alpha diversity estimation of the bacterial community in the gut of different life stages of D. rhizophagus.a Mean values between two biological replicates for each life stage except in pupae.b Phylogenetic diversity indexamong life stages Welch F test F  25.63 p  0.05 the highest richness was observed in emerged and pre-emerged adults while the lowest value was found in the larval stage .

A total of 4 phyla 7 classes 15 families and 23 genera comprised the bacterial community in all life stages at the genus level only Rahnella Serratia Pseudomonas and Propionibacterium were recorded in all development stages being Rahnella the most abundant.Principal Coordinates Analysis PCoA of the bacterial community in the gut of different life stages of D. rhizophagus.

The PCoA was conducted using unweighted a and weighted b pairwise UniFrac distances among communities of life stages and replicates.Previous a-diversitystudies reported from 5 to 11 bacterial genera in specific life stages of some species of the Dendroctonus and Ips genera using culture-dependent and culture-inde- pendent methods   - -.

Whereas several authors have argued that the low a-diversity observed in bark beetles can be attributed to the presence of defensive chemical compounds in conifers  an alternative hypothesis is to assume that different morpho-physiological factors in the gut of these insects act as strong selective factors structuring the microbial communities in these bark beetles.Heatmap of relative abundances of the most important metabolic pathways inferred by PICRUSt in the gut bacterial community of D. rhizophagus across its life cycle.

Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas isolated from D. rhizophagus have also been shown to be implicated on lipolytic and esterase activities and Pseudomonas has been shown to have amylolytic and xylanolytic activities  which may complement the nutritional capacity of these bark beetles by allowing the use of phloem as a food source.Finally the genus Pseudomonas isolated from D. terebrans  and Raoultella from D. rhizo- phagus and D. valens have shown diazotrophic activity in vitro  which could contribute to the nitrogen balance in insects.Of particular interest is the presence of Rahnella Serratia Pseudomonas and Propionibacter- ium in all life stages which suggests that they might represent a core within the microbiome.

The error associated with the molecular technique used should not be discarded.Although there is not a reliable explanation why the presence and relative abundance of the non-dominant bacteria vary among different life stages and replicates we hypothesize that dominant bacteria Rahnella Serratia and Pseudomonas along the insect's immune system may regulate the gut bacterial community.

This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial community of the gut of the bark beetle D. rhizophagus during the insect's life cycle using 454 pyrosequen- cing.

Other important pathways found in a lower proportion were metabolism of terpenoids poliketydes lipids and xenobiotics .DiscussionThis study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial community in the gut of the bark beetle D. rhizophagus throughout its life cycle using 454 pyrosequencing.
