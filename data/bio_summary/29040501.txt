A Axenic S. litura larvae did not exhibit increase in the number of stem cells on feeding 5 DSS-supplemented diet B Axenic S. litura larvae re-colonized with Pseudomonas exhibits increase in the number of stem cells on feeding 5 DSS-supplemented diet C Axenic S.litura larvae re-colonized with Enterobacter exhibits increase in the number of stem cells on feeding 5 DSS- supplemented diet D Axenic S. litura larvae re-colonized with Acinetobacter did not exhibit increase in the number of stem cells on feeding 5 DSS-supplemented diet.

Together with the killing curves for control untreated and diet containing 3 DSS 3 DSS we observed a dose-dependent killing of S. litura larvae by DSS.Quantization of sulfated polysaccharides in feces ofSpodoptera litura larvaeStandard curve for DSS was plotted.

While population kept on DSS diet from neonate stage 3 DSS-Neonate exhibited maximum deviation Bray-Curtis value 0.558-586 from other population Table .Further Fisher's Exact test with Storey FDR multiple test cor- rection demonstrated that bacterial phylotypes Enterobacter and Escherichia were significantly abundant P  0.05 in S. litura lar- vae fed on DSS diet from neonate stage as compared to othersamples.
