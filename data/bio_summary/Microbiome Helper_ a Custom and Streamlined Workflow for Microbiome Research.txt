As the microbiome research field continues to evolve Microbiome Helper will be updated with new protocols scripts and training materials.KEYWORDS 16S rRNA gene sequencing Microbiome Helper bioinformatics dual-indexing PCR education metagenomics microbiome standard operating procedure virtual machineesearch has associated the human microbiome with lifestyle changes  severity of disease  treatment outcomes   and the built environment .

Illumina has since improved its sequencing image base-calling to require less phiX even with very low sequence diversity libraries opening the door for a simplified dual-indexing strategy.On the bioinformatics front there have been tremendous efforts to develop systems to process and analyze microbiome data including QIIME  and mothur  primarily for 16S rRNA data while metagenomic data analysis is still often pieced together using various individual bioinformatic methods .

Note that achieved cluster densities and final outputs are slightly below Illumina's best-case scenario specifications but this is to be expected as the latter is for a complex phiX genomic library whereas the former amplicon libraries typically pose a challenge for NGS systems and can easily overcluster saturate leading to reduced Q30 and pass- filter read numbers.TABLE 1 Run metrics for the first 25 amplicon runs 9145 total samples at the IMR and comparison to Illumina's MiSeq maximum output specifications for phiXaNumbering is not consecutive as other metagenomics runs were completed in between amplicon runs.bExtra phiX was added to this run for diagnostic reasons and does not factor into the below mean.cNA not applicable.For diagnostic purposes and to show an example of sample performance the commonly used bacterial Mock Community B developed for the HMP project BEI Resources was processed using our protocol employing two separate sets of primers for the V4-V5 and V6-to-V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene  in triplicate on threeFIG 1 Workflow diagram of on-bench and bioinformatic custom pipelines.

Amplicon samples in our presented protocol are run on the Illumina MiSeq using 2 X 300 bp PE v3 chemistry which allows for overlap and stitching together of paired amplicon reads into one full-length read of higher quality see below for further quality discussion.

This resource will provide the foundations for those newly enter- ing the microbiome field and will provide much-needed guidance and best practices to ensure that quality microbiome research is undertaken.

Currently Illumina sequencing is the most prevalent next-generation sequencing NGS technology for microbiome sequencing and several studies have outlined different methods and strategies for processing samples .

It is currently only a lack of support from Illumina on the run-prep software side that leads to this work-around the v3 kit chemistry fully supports physically sequencing these libraries and Illumina's cloud-based BaseSpace application also properly handles postrun delivery and analysis of these samples.Bioinformatics pipeline.

All protocols scripts workflows tutorials and virtual images are freely available through the Microbiome Helper website .IMPORTANCE As the microbiome field continues to grow a multitude of research- ers are learning how to conduct proper microbiome experiments.

Here we present the examples of 16S V6-to-V8 bacteria and archaea and 18S V4 eukarya amplicons but the protocols can be easily modified for use with any correctly sized amplicons of your choice--such as other rRNA gene variable regions or any functional genes of interest such as psbA cox1 etc.. At the IMR we have successfully tested and deployed additional amplicons for 16S V4-V5  fungal ITS1 and ITS2   nitrogen cycle nifH J.

Mean- while the microbiomes from oceans  to atmospheres  have provided key insights into the influence and response of particular microbes to various complex environ-ments.Methods for profiling microbiome samples have changed from presequencing techniques such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms to newer sequenced-based approaches including amplicon rRNA gene sequencing metagenomics and metatranscriptomics.
