Similarly we found no evidence of substantial absorption of masked zearalenone compounds ZEN14Glc a-ZEL14Glc and 3-ZEL14Glc in our transport model indicating limited bioavailability of glucose- bound zearalenone compounds.

Here we assess the metabolism and transport of glucoside metabolites of common trichothecenes deoxynivalenol nivalenol T-2 toxin and zearalenone compounds zearalenone a- and 3-zearalenol in the human gut in vitro.Methods and results Masked mycotoxins were incubated with artificial digestive juices and absorption was assessed in differentiated Caco-2TC7 cells.

Fecal extracts from hydroly- sis experiments using masked zearalenone compounds were further analyzed for zearalenone metabolites by LC-HRMS see online Supporting Material.2.5 Statistical analysisTime course experiments of microbial hydrolysis of masked mycotoxins were run on fecal samples from six donors inFigure 1.

Information on other masked Fusarium mycotoxins is scarce with two in vitro studies demonstrating T2Glc 15 and ZEN14Glc 18 to be stable toward digestive juices of the upper GI tract but hydrolyzed by human fecal microbiota 25.This study is the first comprehensive comparison of the major glucose conjugates of trichothecenes DON3Glc NIV3Glc T2Glc and zearalenone compounds ZEN14Glc a-ZEL14Glc 3-ZEL14Glc to better predict their bioavailabil- ity in the human gut.

Cells were then exposed to 2 nmolesmL of trichothecenes DON DON3Glc NIV NIV3Glc T2 T2Glc or zearalenone compounds ZEN ZEN14Glc a-ZEL a-ZEL14Glc 3-ZEL 3-ZEL14Glc in serum-free DMEM from the luminal api- cal side for 0 1 6 or 24 h and transport to the systemic basolateral side was studied.

Hence the current study aims to assess the fate of important masked trichothecenes deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside DON3Glc nivalenol-3-glucoside NIV3GlcT-2-3-glucoside T2Glc and masked zearalenone compounds zearalenone-glucoside ZEN14Glc a- and 3-zearalenol-glucoside a-ZEL14Glc and 3 -ZEL14Glc and their respective free parent mycotoxins under gastrointestinal conditions in vitro.Hydrolysis of masked mycotoxins under gastro-intestinal conditions was assessed by exposing them to artificial saliva artificial gastric and duodenal juices including all digestive enzymes and to artificial bile juice.

Free trichothecenes were absorbed intact whereas free zearalenone compounds were absorbed and metabolized to undetected compounds by Caco-2TC7 cells.

All mycotoxins were stable in cell-free DMEM culture medium after 24-h incubation recovery ZEN14Glc 95.3 - 4.1 a-ZEL14Glc 106.6 - 1.7 3-ZEL14Glc 108.0 - 1.8ZEN 100.9 - 2.0 a-ZEL 92.0 - 3.1 3-ZEL 95.7 - 5.4.T2Glc hydrolysis started after 4 h but was only completed in three out of five donor samples by 72 h. Hydrolysis to T2 only reached 30-50 of the total toxin added before further deacetylation to HT2 was observed.Hydrolysis of masked zearalenone compounds by fecal microbiota of five donors occurred more rapidly as compared to trichothecenes with cleavage of ZEN14Glc a-ZEL14Glc and 3-ZEL14Glc being detectable after 0.5 h of incubation and over 97 of all three masked compounds disappearingFigure 4.
