analysis of the 80 zetaproteobacteria nodes showed differ- ential abundance of 21 biomarkers between the two geographic regions mar 10 lo-'ihi 11 - notably nodes from zetaotu9 2155 zetaotu15 1198 zetaotu17 1833 zetaotu14 1764 and zetaotu2 1194 enriched at the mar as well as zetaotu2 2086 2094 zetaotu1 2110 zetaotu4 2123 2132 zetaotu6 2076 zetaotu10 1918 and zetaotu14 2067 enriched at lo-'ihi figs 3 and 4. zetaotu17 was not detected in any lo-'ihi samples and only a small subset of samples from lo-'ihi had reads from either zetaotu9 or zetaotu15.

non-metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis of bray-curtis dissimilarity matrix from med data showed mar samples clustering separately from lo-'ihi samples however community similarity was not resolved between north and south hiolo ridge samples fig.

combined samples from lo-'ihi contained comparable broad-level taxonomic profiles as mar samples fig.

none of the 52 zetaproteobacteria nodes were found in all sam- ples across lo-'ihi and the mar however 4 were found in all lo-'ihi samples veil and non-veil specifically nodes from zetaotu1 2110 zetaotu2 2086 2095 and otu14 2067 fig.

feii concentrations were 18.3 lm near sample c56 46.2 lm around the veil samples and 70.1 lm where the non-veil samples b1-b4 were collected.comparison between veil and non-veil samples from m39b.

though all samples had an abundance of zetaproteobacteria veil samples had contained med node 1668 unclassified gammaproteobacteria while the non-veil samples were enriched in node 1537 flavobacteria.

zetaotu1 was abundant at lo-'ihi especially node 2110 which was enriched in veil samples and widely distributed in non-veil samples figs 3 and 4. in contrast we found little evidence of zetaotu1 at the mar suggesting that zetaotu1 may be restricted to the pacific and not globally cosmopolitan.

a more detailed analysis of the vent fluid chemistry at these sites was published previously glazer and rouxel 2009.the summit of lo-'ihi is in an o2 minima zone where ambi- ent o2 concentrations range from 30 to 60 mm.approximately 82 000 16s rrna pyrotag reads were gen- erated from 38 samples collected at sites within the lo-'ihi seamount.

both of zetaotu6 and zetaotu28 were exclusive to non-veil samples at lo-'ihi and only matched single amplified genome sag 16s rrna gene sequences retrieved previously from lo-'ihi field et al.

node 2103 in particular was abundant in samples from both sites and phylogenetic inference showed that node 2103 was most similar to sags from both the mar and lo-'ihi supporting information fig.

2014. this is perhaps not surprising as our data suggests that these zetaotus are restricted to lo-'ihi veils and select mar samples see discussion below fig.

2015. it remains unclear whether sheath-dominated mats at the mar are functionally similar to veiled mats at lo-'ihi or rather that zetaotu9 proliferates under similar environmental conditions and that different med nodes result from genetic drift.curiously veil samples were also enriched in node 1668- an unclassified gammaproteobacteria - and contained 99.7 of all reads from this node fig.
