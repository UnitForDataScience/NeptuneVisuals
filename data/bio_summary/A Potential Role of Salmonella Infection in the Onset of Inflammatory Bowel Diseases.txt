Typhimurium the bacterial virulence factors and the defec- tive processes in susceptible individuals such as those described in IBD patients could generate a persistence of the bacteria in dendritic cells which would generate a continuous secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an environment of inflam- mation which means that an infection with S. Typhimurium in these patients could have a double effect being more permissive to the infection caused by this intracellular bacteria.

Here we present a comprehensive review of studies performed in human and mice susceptible to IBD which supports the notion that infection with bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella could promote the onset of IBD due to permanent changes in the intestinal microbiota disruption of the epithelial barrier and alterations of the intestinal immune response after infection.Keywords inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis gut microbiota Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium innate immune response virulence factorsiNTRODUCTiONInflammatory bowel disease IBD is defined as a set of pathologies that exhibit a progressive and chronic phenotype where the intestinal immune response and the normal gut microbiota are altered .

Typhimurium iNFeCTiON PReviOUS OR AFTeR iBD ONSeTIn this section we will discuss some factors that could relate the intestinal inflammation that occurs in IBD and the intestinal infection caused by S. Typhimurium .

Due to the factors mentioned above it is possible that in IBD patients will be more susceptible to suffer a more aggressive infection by S. Typhimurium or even to develop a persistent infection due to the baseline inflamma- tion and impaired intestinal environment.

The combination of virulence factors displayed by S. Typhimurium and the genetic alterationsof the host that prevent correct bacterial clearance suggests that an infection with S. Typhimurium in a susceptible host could gen- erate changes in the proliferation and differentiation of Paneth cells which in patients suffering IBD will exacerbate the defect produced by the mutation in some of the genes related to this pathology which finally will modify the lysozyme secretion with a consequent alteration in microbiota.

It is possible that all these alterations could be due to S. Typhimurium infection which results in an increased inflammation in susceptible patients   .It is known that S. Typhimurium can produce an inflamma- tory environment due to virulence proteins coded by SPIs which improve its fitness over intestinal microbiota and thereby to reach and invade the epithelium .

Additionally it is known that this bacterium can cause persistent infection in human and in mice suggesting that in patients displaying one or more genetic defects that predispose to IBD development it is possible that they are much more susceptible to be infected by S. Typhimurium and cause a persistent infection.

All this combined with a genetic susceptibility will impair the recognition of pathogens the autophagy tissue repair and bacterial clearance generating an inflammatory condition at the intestinal epithelium.CONCLUDiNg ReMARKSIn this review we discussed several microbial cellular and genetic alterations described so far in IBD patients and related these defects with the infection caused by S. Typhimurium.

It would be relevant to evaluate whether IBD patients are chronic carriers of S. Typhimurium in the intestine.Supporting the hypothesis raised in this review it has been described that IBD patients have a deregulated immune response in the intestine which is reflected for instance by the secretion of IgG instead of IgA resulting in an inflammatory response against their own microbiota .

We will focus on S. enterica serovar Typhimurium .Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium S. Typhimurium is a facultative Gram-negative and intracellular bacterium which infects several host including humans .
