Along with this microbial commu- nity structure of the surrounding water was also explored todetermine its possible role in structuring the microbial composition of tilapia.Materials and MethodsThe adult tilapia were collected from two sampling sites.

The water microbial com- position of the respective habitat also showed significant difference from each other and tilapia gut microbial com- munity Fig.

In this study we have explored the gut microbial composition of tilapia using the Illumina Miseq platform for the first time.
