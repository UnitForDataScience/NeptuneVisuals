Finally 0.439 mmol 92.1 mg of EC-M9 and 2.29 mmol 445.2 mg of EGC-M11 were obtained and their structures were confirmed by NMR analysis.EC-M9 1H-NMR methanol-d4 d. 6.67 1H d J8.0 Hz6.63 1H d J2.0 Hz 6.50 1H dd J8.0 2.0 Hz 2.49 2Ht J7.0 Hz 2.31 2H t J6.7 Hz 1.62 4H m.

Then each catechin metabolite in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO was added at a final concentration range of 0.4 to 50 ugmL and incubated for 72 h at 37degC under an atmosphere of 5 CO2.

Chemical Structures of Catechin Metabolites and Their Inhibitory Activity on HeLa Cell ProliferationInhibitory activity is noted in brackets and is expressed relative to negative control DMSO set at 100.the supernatant the cells were dissolved in 150 uL of DMSO and the absorbance was measured by a microplate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm.To determine IC50 HeLa cells were treated with EGC-M9 the most effective inhibitor among catechin metabolites against the proliferation of HeLa cells and adriamycin wasused as a positive control.

NoteInhibitory Activity of Catechin Metabolites Produced by Intestinal Microbiota on Proliferation of HeLa CellsAya Hara-Terawaki Akiko Takagaki Hirotsugu Kobayashi and Fumio NanjoFood Research Laboratories Mitsui Norin Co. Ltd. 223-1 Miyabara Fujieda Shizuoka 426-0133 Japan.Received February 9 2017 accepted April 18 2017Eleven kinds of catechin metabolites produced from --epigallocatechin EGC and --epigallocatechin gallate EGCg by intestinal microbiota were evaluated for inhibitory activity on the proliferation of HeLa cells which are human cervical cancer cells.

Tea catechins including -cat- echin catechin hydrate and EGCg have been reported to inhibit proliferation of human cervical cells SiHa and HeLa cells and their inhibitory mechanisms were discussed.24-27 However anti-proliferative activity of catechin metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota against cervical cancer cells is not known.In this study we evaluated the effects of catechin metabo- lites on proliferation of HeLa cells as a model for human cer- vical cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials The following catechin metabolites were pre- pared using the methods we reported previously.10-132-35-Dihydroxyphenyl-34-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran- 357-triol EGC-M1 1-345-trihydroxyphenyl-3-246- trihydroxyphenylpropan-2-ol EGC-M2 1-35-dihydroxy- phenyl-3-246-trihydroxyphenylpropan-2-ol EGC-M3 4- hydroxy-5-35-dihydroxyphenylvaleric acid EGC-M4 5- 35-dihydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone EGC-M5 3-35- hydroxyphenylpropionic acid EGC-M6 4-hydroxy-5-345- trihydroxyphenylvaleric acid EGC-M7 5-345-trihydroxy- phenyl-g-valerolactone EGC-M8 5-35-dihydroxyphenyl- valeric acid EGC-M10 1-34-dihydroxyphenyl-3-246- trihydroxyphenylpropan-2-ol EC-M1 4-hydroxy-5-34- dihydroxyphenylvaleric acid EC-M3 5-34-dihydroxy- phenyl-g-valerolactone EC-M4.

However the value of EGC-M9 was roughly 8.6times higher than that of EGCg 47.9 uM which have reported to exhibit the inhibitory activity against HeLa cell prolifera- tion.27 Thus this compound can contribute to the cancer pre- ventive effect of green tea catechins.In this study we newly discovered that EGC-M2 EGC-M7 EGC-M9 and EC-M9 formed from EGC EGCg and EC by intestinal microbiota inhibit the proliferation of cervical can- cer HeLa cells.

In our study EGC-M8 showed no inhibitory activity on HeLa cell proliferation suggesting that selectivity may also be a factor with HeLa cells.

After the adjustment to pH 4.0 with 5 citric acid solution the reaction solution was added to 3 mL of distilled water and was extracted 3 times with 5 mL of chloroform.

The dichloromethane layer was washed with 10 mL of 5 sodium thiosulfate solution and 10 mL of saturated NaCl solution.

Next the mixture was extracted with 20 mL of ethyl acetate and the ethyl acetatelayer was washed with distilled water the saturated NaHCO3 solution and saturated NaCl solution.

The organic layer waswashed with distilled water saturated NaHCO3 solution and saturated NaCl solution and was dehydrated with sodium sulfate.
