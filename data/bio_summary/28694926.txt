the colon is composed of five parts namely cecum ascending colon transverse colon descending colon and sigmoid colon.

understanding the mechanisms of dminduced changes of the intestine and colon is of key importance for the optimization of treatment and for finding new therapeutic approaches.in this review we discuss 1 dminduced intes tinal and colonic histomorphological changes and biomechanical remodeling 2 intestinal and colonic sensorymotor dysfunction in relation to dm and its relation to the remodeling of intestine and colon and3 the clinical consequences of dminduced changes in intestine and colon including diarrhea constipation gm change and colon cancer.

it was found in diabetic colon that the opening angle and residual strain became bigger and the stiffness of the colon wall increased with the duration of dm both in the circumferential and longitudinal directions figure 2. more recently the remodeling of the distal colon in dm was studied by siegman et al51 in rats.

therefore understanding the association between dm and the risk of colon cancer is crucial.although some studies have reported no overall associations between dm and colon cancer risk208211 most studies support the finding of an association between dm and colon cancer.

finally the clinical consequences of dm- induced changes in the intestine and colon including diarrhea constipation gut microbiota change and colon cancer are discussed.

the longitudinal layer of muscle fibers forms three discrete bands named tenia and the formation of sacs filled with adipose tissue on the inner surface gives the colon a segmented appearance characterized by small pouches named haustra.the histologic characteristics of the intestine and colon shares many similarities.

thus immunohistochemical stains that utilize antibodies against ckit allow the iccs to be labeled18.biomechanical properties of normal intestine and colon one important function of both small intestine and colon is the transportation of food by peristaltic contraction.

the biomechanical characteristics of the normal small intestine and colon can be summarized in table 1.the variation of biomechanical properties along and across the wall of intestine and colon have important physiological significance.

it clearly demonstrated that the mucosa and muscle layers in the diabetic colon became much thicker than in the normal colon.

such changes may be caused by the loss of enteric neurons in the colon due to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis.results from animal studies are ambiguous and have shown both delay and enhancement in the colon transit time in dm.

their results suggest that the decrease of interstitial cells of cajal network cholinergic receptors and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the proximal colon plays important roles in dmrelated dysfunction of colon.

chang et al113 indicate that the increased contractions of distal colon in dm rats are partly mediated by the il6 receptor pathway.diabetes-induced sensory changes in the intestine and coloncompared with published studies on motor disorders in dm only few studies have addressed the sensory function of intestine and colon in the dm table 3. in relation to the small intestine it has been demonstrated in a human study that there was an overall hyposen sitivity to the combination of all stimulations including mechanical thermal and electrical stimulations in the duodenum in the dm patients114.
