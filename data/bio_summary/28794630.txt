E The erosion area  of each group was measured in D. The rOI in B was indicated by the yellow square box.

D The number of TraP-positive cells in each group was measured in C. The data are presented as the mean - seM n5-7.

caseiFigure S2 The effect of Lactobacillus casei on the levels of TNF-a Il-6 Il-4 and Il-10 in vitro.Notes The levels of TNF-a Il-6 Il-4 and Il-10 in the incubation medium after 24 hours culture of colonic mucosa.

The concept of macrophage polarization was recently considered to play a role in the pathological mechanism of aseptic loosening.167 M1 proinflammatory macrophages were activated in response to wear debris dominating the M2 anti- inflammatory response.

The increased ratio of M1M2 macrophages from peri-implant tissues compared with osteoarthritic synovial tissues has been reported.7 Furthermore the modulation of macrophage polarization was considered an effective means to mitigate wear particle-induced osteolysis.16submit your manuscript  International Journal of Nanomedicine 201712 5387-53975387c 2017 Wang et al.

The particles were autoclaved for 15 minutes at 121degC and 15 psi for sterilization and then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline PBS.

The particles were endotoxin-free as determined by a commercial detection kit chromogenic end-point TAL with diazo coupling kit Xiamen Houshiji Ltd Xiamen People's Republic of China.

The wear particle-induced calvarial osteolysis model in 8-week-old C57BLJ6 mice has been described previously.1718 Briefly the mice were anesthetized and the cranial periosteum was separated from the calvarium by sharp dissection.

The culture medium was collected and stored at -20degC for assay of receptor activator of nuclear factor NF-kB ligand RANKL osteoprotegerin OPG TNF-a IL-6 IL-4 and IL-10.Micro-computed tomography micro-cT scanningAfter culturing in DMEM the mouse calvaria were analyzed by a high-resolution micro-CT SkyScan1176 SkyScan Aartselaar Belgium at a resolution of 18 um and X-ray energy settings of 45 kV and 550 uA.
