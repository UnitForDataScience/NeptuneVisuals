The determination was done against acetanilide at 1020 degC with times of combustion of 25 s and measurement of 420 s. The con- tent of total inorganic carbon TIC was determined using a CM 5012 CO2 coulometer coupled to a CM 5130 acidification module UIC USA.

The sampling revealed a second fuel leakage from an underground pipeline at the spill site.

The hydrocarbon fraction spilt over frozen and snow-covered ground reached the sea and dispersed with the currents.

The most commonly used fuels in Antarctica are lubricant oil and gasoline for boat engines marine gasoil jet fuel and light diesel.

The hy- drocarbons most commonly encountered in Antarctic soils are n- alkanes from C9-C15 with a low content of heavier aliphatic fractions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs mainly represented by naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes .

The con- ventional remediation technologies that are used to clean up these con- taminants are difficult to implement in Antarctica as temperatures are low and most areas are covered by ice and snow at least eight months a year.

The power gen- eration to support all station activities including the use of vehicles re- quires transport and handling of fuel which creates the risk of accidental spills.

The four sub-samples 200 g each collected from the walls in each pit for each depth layer were combined into one homogenous composite sample per location and depth layer.

The upper 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm depth sections of the cores were homogenized and used for chemicaland microbial analyses.
