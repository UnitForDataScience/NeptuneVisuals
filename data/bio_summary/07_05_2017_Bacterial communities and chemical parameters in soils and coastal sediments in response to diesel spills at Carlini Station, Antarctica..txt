due to the high number of thin low-intensity bands we had to visually analyzed the main differences between samples and selected eight representative samples for the construction of clone libraries four soils from the origin site of the spill samples 7a10 and 7a11 the site of accumulation of meltwater containing hydrocarbons samples 5a10 and 5a11 two soils from a site not affected by the spills samples 10a10 and 10a11 and two sediments from thefig.

for sediment samples names refer to the transect with directions of transects s1 called 360deg  a 320deg  b 340deg  c followed by the sampling point in each transect points sampled 75 m offshore  1 150 m  2 35 m  3 depth of sediment layer surface samples 0-5 cmbsf  s deep samples 10-15 cmbsf  d and year of sampling.

the resulting restriction patterns were clustered with theevidence of eutrophication with tn and toc contents of 0.49 and 3.6 in the surface layer and 0.2 and 1.7 in the subsurface layer.the water content by weight of soil samples was variable ranging from 7.7 to 19.2 in subsurface samples and from 4.5 to 18.2 in sur- face soils except for sample 5a2010 31.0. site 5 lies in a small de- pression where meltwater running down from the higher surroundings accumulates.the tph contents of all sediment samples were below the detection limit.

the two samples from each core are hereafter referred to as s surface and d deep sediment samples.

the highest contents of toc were found in surface sediments taken 150 m offshore transects s1 s2 s3 and s4 samples 2s see and supplementary table s1 with values between 0.45 and 1.18. the high toc values in those samples relate to more fine- grained sediments  with a slightly larger proportion of silt and organic rich material.

however samples taken closer to the coast 35-75 m where sediments are most- ly coarse-grained sand and samples taken nearly 150 m offshore where sediments are more fine-grained sandy mud had remarkably different patterns.

the number of clone sequences appearing only once singletons represented 44 of total otus for both sediment samples and 56-63 for the soil samples except for 5a11 with 40 sin- gletons.

colored dots orange yellow and blue indicate the starting points in land and the locations sampled along the transects.referred to as a 30-35 cm subsurface layer referred to as b and 90-95 cm subsurface layer referred to as c. four soil samples were collected at each depth from pits dug into the soil at each sampling loca- tion using a hexane-rinsed trowel.

two more samples were taken at control sites s5 and s6 close to the glacier and on the opposite side of the cove .

samples were collected by scuba-divers with hand-held corers 10-cm diameter.

for logistic reasons not all sites of the six transects could be sampled in 2010 but every location was sampled in 2011. soil and sediment samples were placed in glass jars washed with 10 hydrochloric acid rinsed with milliq water and then with hexane.

the samples were stored at -20degc and transported to our laboratory at the university of buenos aires.chemical analysistotal carbon tc and total nitrogen tn contents were measured using a cns analyzer euro ea-cn elemental analyzer hekatech gmbh germany.

location and references to the sampling sites are shown in .a control samples assumed not to be impacted by hydrocarbons.
