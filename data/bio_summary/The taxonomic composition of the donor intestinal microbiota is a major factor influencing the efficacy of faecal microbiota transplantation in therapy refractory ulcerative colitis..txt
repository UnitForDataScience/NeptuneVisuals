The faecal microbiota of stool donors used in patients with the best treatment success to faecal microbiota transplantation were characterised by a different taxonomic compo- sition as a significant higher abundance of A. muciniphila and had a higher bacterial richness compared to a donor microbiota of unsuc- cessfully treated patients.A specific donor microbiota factor for successful faecal micro- biota transplantation in ulcerative colitis was also supported by Moayyedi et al.20 In their study ulcerative colitis patients treated with the stool of one specific donor showed a higher response rate to faecal microbiota transplantation than patients who received the stool from other donors but a specific microbiota signature associ- ated with treatment response was not reported.

The large variability of faecal microbiota transplantation efficacy in ulcerative colitis patients raised several questions regarding the right faecal microbiota transplantation protocol or patient factors influenc- ing treatment success.17The aim of the current study was to establish a faecal micro- biota transplantation treatment protocol with high clinical efficacy in therapy refractory ulcerative colitis patients and to investigate which patient or donor factors are responsible for the treatment success.

B A high relative abundance of A. muciniphila was detected in patients responding to faecal microbiota transplantation on the first day after the initial faecal microbiota transplantation application day 3 with a significant increase in RE patients compared to partial response PR or NR.

The importance of the donor microbiota might also explain the large variations in response rates of faecal microbiota transplantation in ulcerative colitis reported in previous studies ranging between 0 and 10012-22 and also why one randomised study showed no significant effect of FMT.19 The concept of mixing stool from different donors as performed by Paramsothy et al might increase the likelihood of transferring a ben- eficial microbiota to ulcerative colitis patients and could therefore explain the superiority of faecal microbiota transplantation over pla- cebo in this study.21 As the abundance of the taxa found to be asso- ciated with treatment response in our study is influenced by diet it is important for future studies to also assess the diet of the donors which might be a contributing factor for response to FMT.In contrast to the signature in the donor microbiota there was no clearly discernible pattern in the microbiota of recipients showing a faecal microbiota transplantation response.

Faecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be the most effective treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection47-10 a disease that is mainly triggered by an impaired intestinal colonisation resis- tance to pathogens due to depletion of the microbiota.11 As dysbio- sis is believed to be a significant player in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis the use of faecal microbiota transplantation has been studied in various case series12-18 and in four small randomised controlled trials.19-22 The reported response rate to faecal microbiota transplantation in ulcerative colitis in published series varies between 0 and 100.12-22 In a recent systematic review of studies an aver- age response rate of 49-55 and remission rate of 24-28 was reported.17 Three of the controlled trials20-22 showed a superiority of faecal microbiota transplantation compared to placebo while one trial failed19 to demonstrate a difference between faecal microbiota transplantation and the control group.
