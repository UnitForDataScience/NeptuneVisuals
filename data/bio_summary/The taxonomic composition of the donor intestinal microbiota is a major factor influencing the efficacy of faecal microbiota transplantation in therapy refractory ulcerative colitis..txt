the faecal microbiota of stool donors used in patients with the best treatment success to faecal microbiota transplantation were characterised by a different taxonomic compo- sition as a significant higher abundance of a. muciniphila and had a higher bacterial richness compared to a donor microbiota of unsuc- cessfully treated patients.a specific donor microbiota factor for successful faecal micro- biota transplantation in ulcerative colitis was also supported by moayyedi et al.20 in their study ulcerative colitis patients treated with the stool of one specific donor showed a higher response rate to faecal microbiota transplantation than patients who received the stool from other donors but a specific microbiota signature associ- ated with treatment response was not reported.

faecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be the most effective treatment of recurrent clostridium difficile infection47-10 a disease that is mainly triggered by an impaired intestinal colonisation resis- tance to pathogens due to depletion of the microbiota.11 as dysbio- sis is believed to be a significant player in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis the use of faecal microbiota transplantation has been studied in various case series12-18 and in four small randomised controlled trials.19-22 the reported response rate to faecal microbiota transplantation in ulcerative colitis in published series varies between 0 and 100.12-22 in a recent systematic review of studies an aver- age response rate of 49-55 and remission rate of 24-28 was reported.17 three of the controlled trials20-22 showed a superiority of faecal microbiota transplantation compared to placebo while one trial failed19 to demonstrate a difference between faecal microbiota transplantation and the control group.

the large variability of faecal microbiota transplantation efficacy in ulcerative colitis patients raised several questions regarding the right faecal microbiota transplantation protocol or patient factors influenc- ing treatment success.17the aim of the current study was to establish a faecal micro- biota transplantation treatment protocol with high clinical efficacy in therapy refractory ulcerative colitis patients and to investigate which patient or donor factors are responsible for the treatment success.

the importance of the donor microbiota might also explain the large variations in response rates of faecal microbiota transplantation in ulcerative colitis reported in previous studies ranging between 0 and 10012-22 and also why one randomised study showed no significant effect of fmt.19 the concept of mixing stool from different donors as performed by paramsothy et al might increase the likelihood of transferring a ben- eficial microbiota to ulcerative colitis patients and could therefore explain the superiority of faecal microbiota transplantation over pla- cebo in this study.21 as the abundance of the taxa found to be asso- ciated with treatment response in our study is influenced by diet it is important for future studies to also assess the diet of the donors which might be a contributing factor for response to fmt.in contrast to the signature in the donor microbiota there was no clearly discernible pattern in the microbiota of recipients showing a faecal microbiota transplantation response.

from december 2013 to july 2014 10 further recruited patients were treated as controls receiving only antibiotics without consecutive faecal microbiota transplantation ab-group while 2 more patients of the fmt-group finished follow-up fmt-group n  17. the patients of the control group were tried to be matched according to disease activity and previously failed therapy for ulcera- tive colitis.

however if antibiotics were not followed by faecal micro- biota transplantation ab-group 510 patients could not finish the study according to the protocol since they required additional ther- apy due to c. difficile infection after day 14 n  3 antibiotic-asso- ciated diarrhoea c. difficile negative n  1 and aggravation of ulcerative colitis n  1. in contrast only 117 patient of the fmt- group needed additional therapy low-dose steroids for worsening of ulcerative colitis which he started by himself after day 3 fig- ure s2.tabl e 1 baseline characteristics of patientsmean age y - sd44 - 1836 - 13 .20male sex n 14 823 30.013the responders 4 patients 24 achieved clinical remission and 635 a partial response table s1 all patients with remission hadmean diseaseduration y - sd8 - 87 - 6.53also an endoscopic mayo score of 0 or 1 indicative of mucosal heal- ing.

a possible beneficial property of these ruminococcaceae is their ability to pro- cess nondigestible carbohydrates thereby promoting the production of short chain fatty acids which are known to be decreased in inflammatory bowel disease.41 in the study by vermeire et al ruminococcaceae were claimed to be transferred from the donor to two of the patients responding to faecal microbiota transplanta- tion.35 for clarification the taxa ruminococcus gnavus and ruminococcus torques which have been demonstrated to be increased in ulcerative colitis patients37 and have also to be associ- ated with donors leading to no response to faecal microbiota trans- plantation in ulcerative colitis42 are not the taxa found in our analysis.

maybe other ruminococcaceae found in these donors share similar anti-inflammatory properties like f. prausnitzii another possible explanation is that viable f. prausnitzii which isa1086420akkermansia muciniphilac20151050dialister sp.patientdonor stoolb454035302520151050akkermansia muciniphila in patient stool pre- and post-fmtre pr nrfi gu re 3 efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation correlates to abundance of specific taxa in donors and patients after faecal microbiota transplantation.

despite these limitations we observed a strong signal regarding the composition of the donor microbiota in relation to treat- ment response to faecal microbiota transplantation even if only one sample per donor was analysed suggesting a biologic relevant finding although it needs to be mentioned that because of the small numbers of donors false-positive results due to multiple testing are still possible.this study provides further evidence that repeated faecal micro- biota transplantation is effective in treating patients with therapy refractory ulcerative colitis.
