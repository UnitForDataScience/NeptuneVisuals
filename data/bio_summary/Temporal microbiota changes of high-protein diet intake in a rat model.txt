Therefore in addition to the quantification of the 16S genes of SCFA-producing bacteria we also target the genes encoding butyryl-CoAacetate CoA-transferase and methyl- malonyl-CoA decarboxylase a-subunit to estimate the butyrate- producing and propionate-producing ability which further pro- vides a functional insight into the gut microbiota.In this study which is a follow-up work of our previously re- ports on colonic microbiota  we monitored the temporal change of the gut microbiota in a rat model fed with HPD for 6 weeks and identified both the taxonomic and functional change of fecal microbiota aiming to identify the temporal microbiota changes during HPD feeding.

To dissect temporal changes of microbiota dynamic analyses of fecal microbiota were conducted using a rat model.

The structural alteration of fecal microbiota was observed after 4 weeks especially for the decreased appearance of bands related to Akkermansia species.

The temporal microbiota changes such as the decreases of Pre- votella RoseburiaE.

Collectively by fecal microbiota analysis in a rat model this study uncovered the tem- poral microbiota changes providing a practical approach and important biomarkers for investigating the status of microbial communities.Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by grants from the National Key Basic Research Program of China 2013CB127303 National Natural Sci- ence Foundation of China 31430082 and Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation BK20130058.Appendix A.

Although a six-week high-protein diet 45 protein upregulates the pro-inflammatory response and oxidative stress in colon of rats the dynamic alteration of gut microbiota remains unclear.

Adult rats were fed a normal-protein diet or an HPD for 6 weeks and feces collected at different weeks were used for microbiota and metabolite analysis.

The concentrations ofacetate propionate and butyrate were decreased by HPD P  0.05.

Collectively this study found the temporal alteration of fecal microbiota related to the decreased numbers and activity of propionate- and butyrate-producing bacteria in feces after the HPD.
