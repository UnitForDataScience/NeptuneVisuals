In addition to B. thetaiotaomicron four other human-associated Bacteroides Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides vulgatus Prevotella salivae and P. gingivalis produce an under-phosphorylated lipid A structure .Several Gram-negative bacteria that express immune-evasive lipid A species are associated with an increased risk of atheroscle- rosis   but the oral pathogen P. gingivalis is a striking example of how lipid A variants allow a bacterium to evade TLR4 and promote chronic inflammation through dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses  - .In response to environmental conditions P. gingivalis expresses a variety of lipid A species that are described as TLR4 agonist antagonist or non-stimulating depending on their phosphorylation and acylation states and the resulting immu- nostimulatory activity  -.

We propose that anti-TLR4 interventions must be designed with caution given the balance between the protective and destructive roles of TLR signaling in response to microbiota and associated immunopathologies.Keywords microbiota inflammation toll-like receptors innate immunity immune subversion immune dysregulation atherosclerosisinTRODUCTiOnMany inflammatory conditions and immunological disorders have been recently linked to the microbiota .

Using P. gingivalis mutant strains expressing distinct lipid A moieties we demonstrated that expression of antagonist lipid A was associated with P. gingivalis-mediated systemic inflammation and immunopathology whereas strains expressing agonist lipid A exhibited modest systemic inflammation.

Although Helicobacter pylori expresses a hexa-acylated species of lipid A its predominant lipid A species is mono-phosphorylated and tetra-acylated this combination of underphosphorylation and underacylation of lipid A likely explains the low endotoxic and biological activities of H. pylori LPS .SenGupta et al.

The underacylated lipid A moieties are poorly recognized by TLR4 and the antagonist lipid A species inhibits activation of TLR4 by agonist lipid A species from P. gingivalis or other Gram-negative organisms    .

Not only was dysbiosis of the gut microbiota associated with IBD but distinct shifts in the gut microbiota and a decrease in alpha diversity were also shown to distinguish ileal vs. colonic Crohn's disease .

P. gingivalis intrinsically expresses underacylated lipid A moieties and can modify the phosphorylation of lipid A leading to altered TLR4 signaling.

Penta-acylated lipid A is found in patients withearly stage or less severe CF accompanied by lower levels of IL-8 compared to those with severe late stage CF .Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron expresses a penta-acylated 4'-dephosphorylated lipid A structure and exhibits resistance to various inflammation-associated CAMPs  .

Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide lipid A heterogeneity differential activities of tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A structures on E-selectin expression and TLR4 recognition.

In this review we summarize recent studies demonstrating the role of the microbiota in chronic inflammatory diseases and discuss how specific microorganisms subvert or inhibit protective signaling normally induced by toll-like receptors TLRs.
