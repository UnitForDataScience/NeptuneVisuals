However this study did demonstrate a better response in patients with a higher baseline CRP C reactive protein level and previous reports of a longer required duration of treatment for all anti-adhesion based medications in CD over UC further studies with a longer course of treatment are warranted to determine the actual treatment effect.Manipulation of the Intestinal Microbiome Fecal Microbiota Transplantation and BacteriotherapyThe intestinal microbiome has been recognized as a key component of IBD pathogenesis thought to work mainly by manipulation and activation of the innate immune system.

This review briefly describes the molecular basis of immune based gastrointestinal inflammation in IBD and then describes how several current and future biologic agents work to manipulate these pathways and their clinical success to date.Keywords inflammatory bowel disease innate immunity adaptive immunity molecular targets biologic therapies Anti-TNF Anti-integrins inflammatory cytokinesIntroductionInflammatory Bowel disease IBD is a multifactorial chronic relapsing immune-mediated inflammatory condition composed of two main subtypes namely Crohn's disease CD and Ulcerative Colitis UC.

2017 18 2020 doiunderstood which of these factors are the initiators of inflammation and which are compounders however as an autoimmune condition there is accepted recognition of the role of the innate immune system to initiate inflammation followed by the adaptive immune system to maintain this inflammation and cause progression of disease.The medical treatment of IBD focuses on controlling active and chronic gastrointestinal inflammation and preventing disease progression to induce clinical biochemical endoscopic and histological remission.

However short and longer term safety concerns regarding the use of biologics including the risks of infectious allergic malignant and immune mediated complications need to be fully delineated before these newer medications can be incorporated into clinical practice.This review firstly gives a basic overview of the role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in IBD pathogenesis Figure  and secondly on the use of these factors as treatment targets by biological agents in IBD Figure .

Beyond the barrier function of the innate immune system intraluminal pathogens communicate with the innate immune system via several immune receptors including Toll like receptors TLRs and Nod like receptors NLRs which are important for developing tolerance to certain pathogens and promoting wound healing .

We suggest a simplified approach to dissecting the mechanism of action of current therapies for IBD as outlined in Figure by considering firstly those acting on the adaptive immune system secondly those acting on the innate immune systemand local luminal factors and thirdly those acting on the pleiotropic factors which influence both the innate and adaptive immune systems.

The specific triggers of activation of the immune system in IBD are largely unknown and very complex but are thought to be immune and non-immune based with an accepted role of the gut microbiota and non-immune derived cells of the inflammatory cascade including chemokines and inflammasomes .

They reported a significantly higher rate of clinical remission in the treatment group vs. placebo 47 vs. 23 p  0.008 after 10 weeks of treatment.

Certolizumab pegol is administered via subcutaneous injection and is licensed for the treatment of moderate-severe CD including patients who have failed treatment with other anti-TNF-a agents .

The efficacy for its use in UC and CD was evaluated in the GEMINI studies I and II which showed initial clinical response rates of up to 47.1 and 14.5 and remission rates at 52 weeks of 44.8 and 39 for UC and CD respectively .The GEMINI III study evaluated the use of Vedolizumab in patients with moderate-severely active CD who had previously failed treatment with at least one anti-TNF-a treatment and determined that Vedolizumab was not significantly more effective than placebo at inducing remission by Week 6 however by Week 10 a significantly detectable efficacy over placebo was observed .
