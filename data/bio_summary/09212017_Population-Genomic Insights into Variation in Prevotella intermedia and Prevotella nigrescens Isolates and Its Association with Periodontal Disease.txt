algR and arcB in diseased samples and evgS rcsC and barA in healthy samples Figure 5B Figure S1.We identified the KOs that merely existabsent in Pi- disease or Pn-disease samples as well.

Disease-derived samples had gained or lost several metabolic genes compared to healthy-derived samples which could be linked with the difference in virulence performance between diseased and healthy sample groups.

In some cases the same subjects contributed samples of healthy and diseased areas.General Genome Features of Pooled SamplesGenome sequencing data were generated from four pooled samples as described below.

In total 3210 genes were shared between the Pi- disease and Pi-health groups whereas Pi-disease samples had more group-specific genes than Pi-health samples 1987 vs. 1049.

Only Pi-disease and Pn-disease samples possessed specific sequences that could match proteasome-associated ATPase mpa gene.Metabolic Pathway ReconstructionsWe performed a comparison of metabolic networks between combined disease Pi Pn- disease and combined health samples Pi Pn- health.

Diseased samples were enriched in 17 COGs mostly related to gene regulation signal transduction biosynthesis and function of cell wall structure cell growth processes and transport or metabolism functions whereas healthy samples were enriched in only 1 COG related to energy production and conversion.

Prophages included intact prophages and defective prophages.prophages with Pn-disease and Pi-health samples having more than Pi-disease and Pn-health samples.CRISPR Array SequencesThe numbers of spacers in Pi-disease Pi-healthy Pn-disease and Pn-healthy samples were 577 183 980 and 522 respectively.

In Pi-disease and Pn-disease samples 4.7 and 4.8 spacers showed significant nucleotide similarity to the phage database slightly higher than for Pn-healthy 4.4 and Pi-healthy 2.7 samples.

More spacers matched the plasmid database in Pi-disease 3.3 and Pi-healthy 3.3 samples than in Pn-disease 2.7 and Pn-healthy 2.9 samples Figure S3.DISCUSSIONPi-health was higher than that in Pi-disease group while the ratio in Pn-disease and Pn-health groups were similar.

However disease-derived samples had gained or lost several metabolic genes compared to healthy-derived samples.
