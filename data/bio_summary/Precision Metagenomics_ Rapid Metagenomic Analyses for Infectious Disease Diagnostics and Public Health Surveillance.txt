whereas some groups have developed protocols that allow for 48 h turnaround these methods use 16s rrna gene sequencing rather than wgs data.18 figure 1 depicts our precision metagenomics pipeline that incorporates 3 major tracks 1 stat track 2 comprehensive track and 3 targeted track.

urgent cases are designed to be dealt with by the stat track whereas other less time-sensitive scenarios can be processed through the comprehensive track or the targeted track if there is a specific organism or amplification needed.less clinically urgent cases may undergo further in-depth analysis via the comprehensive track andor targeted track to capture all bacteria mycobacteria fungi parasites and dna and rna viruses fig.

importantly the reduction of diagnostic un- certainty and expedition of the time to optimal treatment have been shown to decrease cost of care and improvepatient survival.5journal of biomolecular techniques 2840-45 c 2017 abrfrecently multiple studies have shown that metage- nomic sequencing of all genomes in a sample technologies are a promising means to identify and track infectious etiologies responsible for outbreaks6 and can also reveal genetic drivers of amr or pathogenesis severity.7 notably these studies use massively parallel ngs technologies to generate whole-genome sequence wgs data to profile comprehen- sively hundreds of organisms in a sample in as little as 12 h8 and even have the capability to discover new infectious agents.9 however despite their potential the application of metage- nomics methods for characterization of clinical samples in real time for patient care is still greatly underused.10since the early work of the human microbiome project11 the concept that microorganisms live in on and around us and ultimately affect our well-being has slowly become integrated into the clinical realm.12-16 however many clinical microbiome studies have focused on bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing which although inexpensive and effective for large studies can miss the putative infectious agent if fungal parasitic or viral in origin.

1. compared with the stat track the comprehensive track will be rna enriched and offers antimicrobial resistance informa- tion and the targeted track will be pcr amplified allowing for the deeper analysis compared with its rapid counterpart but without antimicrobial resistance information.

indeed just as the human genome's refinement over the years has led to improved use in precision medicine30 31 the same is likely to occur with expanding and improved reference genomes for the microbiome.finally recent work in the field epigenetics and rna modifications epitranscriptome has shown an expansive catalog of modified dna and rna in the microbiome and metagenome.

recently methods and kits are being developed that allow simultaneous dna and rna extraction from a single sample22-24 or use of a poly- enzyme cocktail that can more thoroughly digest different microbes.25 further developments on physical enzymatic or chemical extraction and dnarna yield optimizations will help to improve metagenomics and metatranscriptomics studies and aid the adoption of these techniques to clinical care.library preparation and sequencingadditional consideration of the chemistries and steps in library preparation will need to be made and they will depend on the sequencing platform to be used e.g.

here we present a robust protocol for the implementation and application of precision metagenomics across various sequencing platforms for clinical samples.

as the field grows and our understanding of the human microbiome expands methods will likely need to be developed.specimen processingthis phase can be divided into two key components nucleic acid extraction library preparation and sequencing.sample processing is often the bottleneck in micro- biome and metagenomic pipelines and depending on the number of samples to be processed the kits and sequencing platform used can take anywhere from hours to days.nucleic acid extractionnucleic acid extraction poses a particular challenge as ideally both dna and rna would be extracted from a specimen to capture all of the microorganisms and provide an opportunity for more meaningful analyses.

this includes modified dna or rna bases such as methyl-6-adenosine which has been discovered on many bacteria7 32 and also on all examined rna viruses to date including hiv dengue zika yellow fever west nile and influenza.33-35 the use of these nascent discoveries of microbial regulation in a clinical context requires further development of current tools and methods of enriching detecting and computationally specifying the precise sites of modified bases epigenetic and epitranscriptomic and then eventual integration with other tools that are currently improving the detection of microbes.36-39 just as the genome is examined in the context of the epigenome for its regulation viral rnas and modified bases in bacteria will eventually be examined and also understoodjournal of biomolecular techniques volume 28 issue 1 april 201743through these additional lenses of host and microbial regulation.conclusiondespite the challenges and complexity of metagenomics it has the potential to offer a more comprehensive molecular profile of a patient's metagenome and microbiome.

although multiplex pcr microarray or proteomic assays provide pathogen identification within hours from sample collection these platforms are constrained by a priori assumptions of the expected cause of infection17 whereas shotgun-based assays are less biased and open ended allowing for cross-kingdom analysis.in a manner similar to how ngs has revolutionized our understanding assessment and treatment of cancer-- ushering in the era of precision medicine--these same technologies have the potential to launch precision metage- nomics and transform our approach to the management of infectious diseases and public health surveillance.precision metagenomics pipelinengs technologies have already begun to be introduced into clinical microbiology workflows.

within 24 h clinical specimens processed along the stat track are sequenced with nanopore andor single-molecule real-time sequencing technology and transferred to ourbioinformatics pipeline to identify dna-based microbial pathogens amr determinants and virulence factors within hours.
