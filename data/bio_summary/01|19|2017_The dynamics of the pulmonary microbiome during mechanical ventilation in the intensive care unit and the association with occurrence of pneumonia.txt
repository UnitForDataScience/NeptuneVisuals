Eleven patients 31 were classified as having VAP 9 26 as patients without VAP but with colonized airways and 9 26 as patients without VAP and without colonized airways.

LDB Study design literature search data collection data analysis data interpretation and writing.What is the key question Do mechanical ventilation antibiotic exposure and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia influence the composition of the respiratory microbiomeWhat is the bottom line Duration of mechanical ventilation was associated but exposure to antibiotic therapy was not associated with dysbiosis of the respiratory microbiome and this was related to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.Why read on The respiratory microbiome may play an important role in the development of lung disease.

The adapted island model predicts several changes in the respiratory microbiome during intubation and mechanical ventilation.Objectives We hypothesized that mechanical ventilation and antibiotic administrationdecrease the diversity of the respiratory microbiome and that these changes are more profound in patients who develop VAP.Methods Intubated and mechanically ventilated ICU-patients were included.

16S rRNA gene sequencing with the Roche454 platform was used to measure the composition of the respiratory microbiome.Associations were tested with linear mixed model analysis and principal coordinate analysis.Measurements and main results 111 tracheal aspirates were obtained from 35 patients11 had VAP 18 did not have VAP.

Our secondary hypotheses were that 2 duration of mechanical ventilation is associated with dysbiosis of the microbiome and 3 that these changes are more profound in patients that develop VAP.

We also postulated that 4 bacteria that are relatively independent from the rest of the microbiome in a co- occurrence network are the ones that are recognized as potential pathogenic micro- organisms as has been shown for cystic fibrosis previously 13.MethodsDesign and settingThis is a post-hoc analysis of tracheal aspirates of patients that were originally included in an international multi-centre prospective observational cohort study of the predictive value of biological markers for development of VAP 14.

Patients not fulfilling the abovementioned criteria for VAP but of whom microbiological culture revealed presence of bacteria in BAL or ETA were classified as 'colonized patients without VAP'.

The second was the last sample taken before extubation or the first sample taken after VAP diagnosis in those patients that went on to develop VAP.

Figure S1 shows the antibiotic exposure per patient.Association of changes in microbiome with the development of VAP.The changes in alpha diversity did not differ between patients that did and did not develop VAP Figure 2.

There was a statistical difference in Weighted UniFrac distance between patients that developed VAP and control patients without colonized airways Figure 2 p  0.02 but not between patients that developed VAP and patients with colonized airways p  0.24.
