3 Occurrence of primary PHA-degrading microorganisms on PHA films of different chemical composition A--Achromobacter B-- Acidovorax C--Bacillus D--Chitinophaga E--Cupriavidus F-- Delftia G--Ensifer H--Lysobacter I--Mitsuaria J--Nocardia K-- Pseudoxanthomonas L--Pseudomonas M--Roseateles N-- Roseomonas O--Streptomyces P--VariovoraxThe exception was Streptomyces omiyaensis which only formed clear zones on the medium with P3HB3HV.Thus some of the isolates of the same genus formed clear zones on media containing different PHAs suggesting that certain species of microorganisms synthesize depolymerases with broad substrate specificity.

PHA- depolymerase activity displayed as clear zone formation on the solid diagnostic medium with powdered PHAs of different chemicalcompositions as sole carbon source 1--P3HB 2--P3HB4HB 3--P3HB3HHx 4--P3HB3HVFig.

6 Photographs of the films of PHAs with different chemical compositions during their degradation in soil at 21 degC a and 28 degC b a--P3HB4HB b--P3HB3HV c--P3HB3HHx d--P3HBrates.

The soil was weakly alkaline pH 7.1-7.8 with high total exchangeable bases 40.0-45.2 mequiv100 g. The soil contained nitrate nitrogen N-NO3-- 6 P2O5--60 and K2O--220 mgkg soil.MethodsA Study of PHA CompositionPHA composition was determined after performing fatty acid methyl ester methanolysis of PHA specimens by chromatog- raphy of fatty acid methyl esters on an Agilent Technologies 7890A chromatograph-mass spectrometer USA.A Physicochemical StudyThe films were cut into disks 30 mm in diameter 0.035-0.045 mm thick and weighing 35 - 5 mg each.

P3HB3HV had the highest weight average molecular weight Mw--1120 kDa P3HB and P3HB4HB had similar Mw values--625 and 597 kDa respectively and they were lower than the P3HB3HV Mw by almost a factor of 2 P3HB 3HHx had the lowest Mw--356 kDa.

Shishatskaya1Received 25 May 2016  Accepted 29 August 2016  Published online 13 September 2016 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York 2016Abstract The study addre sses d eg rada tio n of polyhydroxyalkanoates PHA with different chemical com- positions--the polymer of 3-hydroxybutyric acid P3HB and copolymers of P3HB with 3-hydroxyvalerate P3HB 3HV 4-hydroxybutyrate  P3HB4HB and 3- hydroxyhexanoate P3HB3HHx 10-12 mol--in the agro-transformed field soil of the temperate zone.

Microorganisms degrading poly-3-hydroxybutyrate P3HB--the best studied and most wide- spread representative of polyhydroxyalkanoates--were firstisolated more than 50 years ago and several genera were identified Bacillus Pseudomonas Streptomyces .

Thus in order to detect primary degraders of PHAsall isolates from biofilms were identified and plated on four types of mineral agar each containing one of the polymers-- P3HB P3HB3HV P3HB4HB or P3HB3HHx--as asole carbon source.To identify primary degraders of PHAs in addition to con- ventional morpho-physiological methods we also used molecular-genetic methods.

The Firmicutes included twoBacillus strains--degraders of P3HB3HHx--and oneP3HB-degrading strain of Chitinophaga sp.

Based on their degradation rates the polymers were ranked as follows 3HB3HV  fiber  P3HB383HV  P3HB93HV194HB  P3HB234HB  P3HB--in the lake and P3HB383HV P3HB3HVfiber  P3HB93HV194HB  P3HB234HB  P3HB--in the soil.Medium-chain-length PHAs containing 3HHx monomers are degraded in biological media with high rates.
