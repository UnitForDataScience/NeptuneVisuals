interestingly smaller silver-coated glass beads and non-coatedglass beads had no effect on tnbs-induced inflammation in the mouse colon data not shown.dss modelthe 4 dss in drinking water given to mice from day 0 to day 5 induced inflammation in the mouse colon as evidenced by macroscopic score 14.33 0.24 vs. 0.33 0.33 for dss-treated mice vs. control respectively p  0.001 a colon damagetable 1non-coated glass beads and silver-coated glass beads 5 beadsanimal ic once daily on days 3-6 from induction of colitis modified colonic microbiota in tnbs-induced colitis in mice.tnbs9.33 - 0.334.75 - 0.940.98 - 0.703.69 - 1.212.24 - 1.17tnbs beads tnbs ag-coated beads8.60 - 0.224.75 - 0.900.00 - 0.001.93 - 0.801.69 - 0.868.57 - 0.264.75 - 0.810.00 - 0.000.00 - 0.002.12 - 1.20number of bacteria shown as number of colony forming units per gram of stool.

noteworthy the size of the silver particles used for the treatment of inflammation as well as the ionization state metallic silver vs. silver ions may affect their interaction with biological membranes and passage to inflamed sites resulting in differences in anti-inflammatory efficacy .several novel formulations based on silver have recently been reported and their anti-inflammatory activity validated in animal models.

others include carbon nanoscrolls cnss build of silver nanoparticles agnps graphene oxide go-based nanocomposites nanosized silica hybrid silver complex nss and silver nanoparticles complexed with a potent antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid .our aim was to design a new formulation based on silver and validate its anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse model of colitis.

the strategy proved to be successful as both silver-coated and non-coated glass beads attenuated colon damage parameters moreover the anti-inflammatory potency of both formulations was similar in case of several parameters of the inflammation in the tnbs model in which - as mentioned above - the mouse colon is more prone to be blocked by the debris.however the silver coating is still crucial for the anti-inflammatory activity of the new formulation.

found that silver-containing preparations may affect proliferation of fibroblasts which coun- teract the infectious action of pyogenic bacteria and promote wound closure however because of the ambiguity on the role of silver in this process further research is necessary.one of the greatest challenges in the design of the study was the selection of an appropriate dose of silver introduced into the inflamed mouse colon.

moreover administration of tnbs in mice resulted in significant infiltration of the colon wall with neutrophils as evidenced by increased mpo activity 12.30 1.44 vs. 6.10 0.66 units for tnbs- treated mice vs. control respectively p  0.001 e. finally the architecture of the colonic wall was compromised as shown by a significant increase in the microscopic damage score 9.12 - 1.31vs.

for ulcer score and colonic shortening the following scale was used 0.5 points for each 0.5 cm of ulcerated tissue shortening of the colon 1 point for 15 and 2 points for 25 based on the mean length of the colon in untreated mice of 8.38 0.11 n  8. the wall thickness was measured in mm.
