He sought not simply to understand the single or even synergistic ways in which several objectionable pollutants damage health act as allergens and cause altered reactivity but also to learn the elements of an environment that actually promote human health over the life course.He pleaded for knowledge of the total environment that equates to health wherein it is defined not simply as being free of atopicdermatitis but a state conducive to reaching human potential.BEYOND THE GENOMEHalf a century later the total environment perspective is of massive importance not only to personal and public health but also to planetary health.

Instead NCDs operate in a slanted direction where the burden points to the socioeconomically disadvantaged.The multifactorial study of health as mediated by total environmental exposures over the life course as originally proposed has taken various names including the developmental origins of health and disease conceptthe enviromeenvirono- micsand more recently the exposome.In each case the nomenclature is unified by understanding that although genetic factors matter total health is not a genetic trait.

Multifactorial investigations with new con- ceptual and experimental methods characterizing health promo- tion and health risks throughout life would be required to solve complex problems.

Solid blue lines represent known adverse health outcomes and dotted red lines indicate postulated adverse health outcomes.

Thus although a personalized view of therapeutic interventions including nutri- tion is keyit is equally important to examine the wider deter- minants of planetary health at the same time.ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGESImprovements in child health over the past 3 decades have seen a global switch from early death from communicable diseases to life lived with disability because of chronic NCDsmany of which have both an environmental and immunologic basis.

These chemicals can act on multiple pathways and have multiple modes of action and multiple postulated or proved adverse health effects .Exposure to hazardous waste has the potential to cause adverse health effects.

The adverse ef- fects have not been well studied but the evidence that exists shows adverse effects on immune development thyroid dysfunc- tion and increases in respiratory diseases and neurodevelopmen- tal and behavioral disorders.Understanding and reducing adverse environmental exposures can improve human health as shown by improved health outcomes after improvements in air quality.In the broadest sense pollution is potentially avoidable but will take considerable effort and funding.RAPID EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA AND BIOINFORMATICS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPOSOMEThe exposome in early life and its effects on immune development and healthy maturation exemplify the complexity modern-day computational and analytic techniques were meant toexposome perturbationsepigenomestranscriptomesproteomesmetabolomesanalysis  computationgenomemicrobiomesexposome biomarkers immune networks causal biologyFIG 6.

The latter is essential for human health.

All rights reservedvarious aspects of a changing environment especially through microbiota exposures can influence health and disease over the life course.
