moreover these microbiota-induced cells are essential to drive disease in two distinct colitis models.recognition of antigens from dominant microbial members by cd4 t cells drives dss colitis severity in dysn6 miceto investigate whether recognition of microbial antigens by cd4 t cells is required for exacerbation of colitis in dysn6 mice dss colitis was induced in otii transgenic mice colonized with the spf-1 cspf-2 or cdysn6 communities figure s7a.

these data demonstrate that distinct types of microbial communities that are stably main- tained in wild-type wt mice are able to alter the host's suscepti- bility to dss colitis.transfer of colitogenic microbial communities into an immunocompetent host induces distinct patterns of host gene expression and alters colitis susceptibility next we investigated whether the degree of colitis severity was also transferable between spf mice with variable dss colitis susceptibility similar to what has been observed for nlrp6 in- flammasome-deficient mice dysn6 .

n  6-14 micegroup.legend continued on next pagefigure s6e further supporting that spf-2 drives colitis severity irrespective of t cells.to investigate whether pathogenic cd4 t cells are required during dysn6-enhanced dss colitis we treated spf-1 and cdysn6 wt mice during dss colitis with an isotype control anti- body or depleting antibodies against cd4 or cd8 respectively.

transfer of the dysn6 but not spf-2 community resulted in enhanced numbers of il-17a and ifn-g single and il-17aifn-g double cytokine- producing cd4 t cells already before induction of dss colitis f. after induction of dss colitis enhanced numbers of cytokine-producing cd4 t cells were observed in mice with both colitogenic communities f. in addition to moni- toring cytokine production in situ we isolated clpls from spf-1 cspf-2 and cdysn6 mice before and after induction of dss colitis and stimulated them with acd3 and acd28 to quantify cytokine production from t cells.

our data identify that specific in- teractions between colitogenic communities and host immune pathways drive colitis development via distinct mechanisms.resultsdss colitis severity is strongly influenced by microbiota composition in spf micedistinct differences in microbiota composition between isogenic mice from commercial vendors--e.g.

spf-1 spf-5 and spf-6 mice were characterized by mild colitis with moderate weight loss and no mortality but spf-2 spf-3 and spf-4 mice as well as dysbiotic nlrp6-- mice developed a similar severe colitis with profound loss of body mass and mortality  b figure s1a.

analysis of b diver- sity using principle coordinates analysis pcoa showed that mice with mild colitis severity spf-1 spf-5 and spf-6 clustered separately from mice featuring a high severity of colitis spf-2 spf-3 spf-4 and dysn6.

transfer of the donor microbiota into germ-free gf recipient exgf mice was confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing e. upon induction of dss colitis exgf mice phenocopied the respective donor mice supporting that the differences in colitis severity were dependent on the microbiota e. similar micro- biota-driven phenotypes were confirmed for the spf-5 and spf-6 communities data not shown.

there- fore we performed cohousing experiments of mice featuring mild colitis spf-1 with mice having high colitis severity spf-2 and dysn6.

these data demonstrate that distinct types of microbial commu- nities are able to alter the host's susceptibility to dss colitis even in already colonized immunocompetent recipients.induction of dss colitis has been shown to alter the composi- tion of the intestinal microbiota .

this analysis revealed that genotype contributed only 3 of variability whereas microbiota contributed around 60. together these data demonstrate that extended immuno- modulation and priming of adaptive immunity by dysn6 but not spf-2 are required to exacerbate colitis severity.colitis development is characterized by the presence of distinct immune signatures in dysn6 and spf-2 mice despite similar disease severity in dysn6 and spf-2 mice upon dss colitis induction our initial results corroborated the hypoth-esis that distinct colitogenic communities contribute to disease development via different pathways.
