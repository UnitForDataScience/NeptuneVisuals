Linear discriminant analysis LDA of the fecal microbiota in MOCK group and PB group b MOCK group and PBProBio group c MOCK group and Health control d. A p-value of 0.05 and a score 2.0 were considered significant in Kruskal-Wallis and pairwise Wilcoxon tests respectively.

p  0.05  p  0.01.The Alteration of MicrobiotaPCA and Bray-Curtis similarity cluster analysis together with a heatmap cluster based on OTU abundance were performed to provide an overview of the gut microbiota composition of the three PI-IBS groups and health control group Figure a-c. No significant differences in a-diversity of microbiota were shown among all groups Figure d. The overall microbiota composition feature of the MOCK group was significantly different from that of the heath control.

Before the trial 60 mice were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups 15 mice per group in 3 cages among which 3 groups were given a gavage of saline MOCK group PB 1.26 mgg body weight PB group PB and probiotics 1.26 mgg body weight PB plus 3.0 x 107 CFUmouse of both Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 PBProBio group respectively.

Mirocha J. DiBaise J. Rao S. Amichai M. Antibiotic treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is the most common type of functional disorder characterized by abdominal pain and discomfort and associated with altered bowel function .

Based on the symptoms IBS may be characterized by a predominance of constipation IBS-C or diarrhea IBS-D or by mixed bowel habits IBS-M and unsubtyped IBS IBS-U .

In this study the increase of Clostridium XIVa and Clostridium sensu stricto in the PBProBio group or PB group might be associated with protective roles in IBS.

The expression of PPARg in colon tissues were confirmed using western blot analysis which elucidated the expression of PPARg decreased in the MOCK group compared with the health control but increased in the PB group and the PBProBio group significantly in protein levels Figure .Figure 6.

The relative abundance of the genera ClostridiumXIVa Clostridiumsensustricto Prevotella Butyricicoccus Ochrobactrum Barnesiella Gemmiger Mucispirillum Intestinimonas and Mucispitillum increased in PB group or PBProBio group compared with the MOCK group.

Since the importance of gut microbiota in IBS pathogenesis has been identified the manipulation of the microbiota is emerging as an attractive therapeutic option for this disease .
