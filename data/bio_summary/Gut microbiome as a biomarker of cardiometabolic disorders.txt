in proper tc level subjects genus faecalibacterium represented 10.80 of aligned reads whereas in improper tc level patients it accounted for only 5.84 t1.91 p0.07 of reads fig.

proper level - subjects meeting the criteria for proper lipid metabolism in tc.

patients with improper tc levels showed higher values of prevotella 24.61 vs 7.42 t  -2.24 p0.03 and lower values of bacteroides 17.03 vs 28.83 t1.73 p0.1 compared with patients meeting the criteria for proper tc concentration fig.

the interaction between the digestive tract microbes and the host is one of the factors which to a great extent determine the patient's condition 8 9. the analyses carried out so far show that changes in gut microbiota composition account for many metabolic disorders including obesity 10-12 inflammatory bowel diseases 13 14 rheumatoid arthritis 15 16 or type 2 diabetes 17 18. the world microbiome project provided information on how race place of residence and diet affect gut microbiota composition 19. studies carried out in recent years contributed to the discovery of the correlation between changes in the gut microbiota composition and cvd.

boxplots were performed by r package.resultsthe data obtained from metagenomic analysis were divided into 2 groups defining proper and improper concentration of ldl-c tc and tg according to european guidelines.

6. participants characterized with proper tc levels demonstrated a significantly increased level of genus clostridium t2.47 p0.02 fig.

to-date it has been stated that prevotella are more efficient at producing tmao than bacteroides 21.the current study indicates that patients with impropertc levels tend to have significantly higher prevotella values than those with proper tc levels p0.03.
