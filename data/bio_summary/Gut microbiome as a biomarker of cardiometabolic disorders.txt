Much effort is also being made to assess how possible it is to modify microbiome composition so as to promote beneficial microbiome members with a view to developing preventionand therapeutic strategies 8.OBJECTIVESThe eastern region of Poland marks the border of European Union and is the region where different multicultural traditions concerning dietary habits and lifestyles meet.

Previous studies 11 27 point to several reasons why faeces prove to be the adequate material to analyse microbiome composition namely a non-invasive method of collection contents rich in microbes and the fact that the gut microbiome represents differences between individuals.

The authors of this study are the first to conduct research in the region on the gut microbiota composition in a group of obese middle-aged men living in this low-industrial region with the aim of finding a correlation between the gut microbiome and atherosclerosis risk factors.

Studies published so far have proved that the gut microbiome of obese subjects differs from that of the healthy ones 10 11.
