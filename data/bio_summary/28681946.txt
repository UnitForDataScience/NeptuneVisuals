microbial communities within each habitat of rock groundwater and soil are linked by their potential metabolic pathwaysdiversity and prevalence of microbes in soil as compared to rock samples thus should be expected.all habitat-dependent attributes structure microbial communities and therefore indicate an influence on prevailing metabolic processes.

for both lower and middle muschelkalk soil developed on this bedrock groundwater and rock samples were investigated for microbial community structure and physiological traits of dominant taxa to test this hypothesis.

the community structure of lower muschelkalk rock rlm middle muschelkalk rock rmm soil of lower muschelkalk slm and soil from middle muschelkalk smm are given in percentages obtained from reads constituting more than 0.5indicates species richness within each sample table in comparison of isolated microbes from soil and rock soils showed higher similarity between the two lithotypes 34 common taxa from a total of 50 while for rocks only one of39 isolates was present on both lithotypes.

the lower muschelkalk yielded seven common genera of a total of 66 while middle muschelkal showed two common of 59. comparison of isolates from rock and soil with groundwatersoil from lower muschelkalk yielded firmicutes in a proportion of approximately 36 while soil on middle muschelkalk was characterized by a higher number offigure 3 archaeal microbiome on genus level from rock of lower muschelkalk rlm.

soil and rock associated microbial communitiesmicrobiomes were compared on genus and kingdom level for bacteria in soil and rock samples.

dna from rock samples was extracted after a modified protocol from 10 g crushed rock samples using a sterile mortar and pistle.

the low numbers of bacteria present in rock samples led to an inconsistent utilization pattern.the substrate groups of polymeric and phenolic sub- stances were utilized by all microbial communities with a preference for phenolic acids by the groundwater communi- ties supporting information fig.

compared to the soil microbiome rock samples indicated an unexpected higher bacterial diversity especially with the lower muschelkalk rlm which comprised eleven different bacterial phyla dominated by proteobacteria 31 of the community followed by actinobacteria 22 and bacteroidetes 17. both rock microbiomes were rather similar with firmicutes as the second largest group added in middle muschelkalk fig.

both soil and rock communities from lower muschelkalk showed metabolic activities for polymers that are usually degraded by secretedtable 1 diversity indices and rarefaction values based on bacterial numbers of otus displaying species richness and diversity in lower muschelkalk lm and middle muschelkalk mm for rock r and soil s samplesenzymes such as depolymerases hydrolyzing poly-3-hydrox- ybutyrate that can be metabolized by fermentation into acetate and butyrate.

all samples were stored at 6 degc prior to analysis.rock samples were taken carefully from the inner core of lower wellenkalk that belongs to the lower muschelkalkfigure 1 localization of sampling sites and view of lithostratigraphy on siteand from the upper schaumkalkbank of the middle muschelkalk at the quarry in bad kosen.

soil and rock habitats were analyzed and compared with groundwater which connects the two by percolating groundwater recharge.

additionally the rhizosphere provides a different community fed by root exudates as well as plantdebris depending on bedrock and its weathered products as well as climate vegetation relief and water supply each soil displays specific characteristics and thus determines the composition of the prevalent microbial community the resulting huge diversity in soil communities ranging from gram-positive spore forming bacteria to gram-negative bacteria and archaea as well as fungi is structured by free living cells and biofilms through percolating water soils and their microbial communities are linked to the subsurface represented by groundwater.

from such habitats mainly gram- positive spore forming bacteria are isolated including bacillus known to degrade granite or streptomyces dissolving hornblende by excretion of siderophores the differences between microbial communities in groundwater could be shown to clearly delineate different host rocks however more similar environments like different lithostratigraphic units of limestone have not been tested for the differentiating power of microbial communities.
