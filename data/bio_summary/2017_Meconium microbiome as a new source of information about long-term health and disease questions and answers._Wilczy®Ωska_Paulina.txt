the placental microbiome of women with gdm showed lower abundance of the order pseudomonadales and the genus acinetobacter compared with controls .autism-like behavior the composition of meconium bacterial flora is reflected in the microbiome of older children and is thought to influence behavior disorders and brain through the gut-brain axis.

the meconium microbiome is thought to indicate the amniotic fluid origin rather than any other sources possibly contributing to the bacterial colonization of the intrauterine environment such as the vaginal canal or the oral cavity .the similarities between the microbial compositionof meconium and amniotic fluid seem to confirm the hypothesis that swallowed amniotic fluid is the source of bacteria in meconium.

the genera lactobacillus and photorhabdus represented a lower proportion of the bacterial com- munity in the 33-weeks samples but their relative abundance was greater in the 33-weeks samples .what is the potential diagnostic value of meconium microbiota determinationthe interaction between microbes and the host during fetal life is suggested to dictate the subsequent health of the individual.healthy full-term newborns a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was revealed by conventional bacterial culture methods in the meconium passed within 2 h of birth and prior to feeding enterococcus and staphylococcus being the most common .

a search for techni- ques that would allow the control and modification of the bacterial flora composition in the intrauterine environment is the subject of numerous studies.maternal dietmanipulation of the maternal microbiota with dietary supplements may potentially temporize fetal inflam- matory responses triggered by chorioamnionitis and restore bacterial intestinal homeostasis at the feto- maternal interface .

although the interest in the impact of the microbiota- host interaction on health and disease is growing  the pathomechanisms of bacterial colonization in utero the effects of the process on the normal fetal development and its disorders consequences for health in the neonatal period childhood and adult life or the therapeutic potential of modifying maternal microbiota during pregnancy remain to be elucidated.understanding of the impact of microbiota on the fetal development might be easier if there were micro- biological and biochemical laboratory parameters spe- cific for the intrauterine environment.

in the last decade bacterial dna sequences were identified by non-culture-based techniques in freshly passed meco- nium .

different mecha- nisms have been postulated for the transmission of bacteria from the mother and bacterial colonization in utero.

the most likely physiological source of bacteria in the intrauterine environment seems bacterial trans- location from the maternal intestine to bloodstream and from there to other organ systems .

ascension and trans- location of vaginal microbiota through the choriodecidual membranes into the amniotic fluid may be another source of bacterial colonization.
