The meconium microbiome is thought to indicate the amniotic fluid origin rather than any other sources possibly contributing to the bacterial colonization of the intrauterine environment such as the vaginal canal or the oral cavity .The similarities between the microbial compositionof meconium and amniotic fluid seem to confirm the hypothesis that swallowed amniotic fluid is the source of bacteria in meconium.

The placental microbiome of women with GDM showed lower abundance of the order Pseudomonadales and the genus Acinetobacter compared with controls .Autism-like behavior The composition of meconium bacterial flora is reflected in the microbiome of older children and is thought to influence behavior disorders and brain through the gut-brain axis.

The genera Lactobacillus and Photorhabdus represented a lower proportion of the bacterial com- munity in the 33-weeks samples but their relative abundance was greater in the 33-weeks samples .What is the potential diagnostic value of meconium microbiota determinationThe interaction between microbes and the host during fetal life is suggested to dictate the subsequent health of the individual.Healthy full-term newborns A diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was revealed by conventional bacterial culture methods in the meconium passed within 2 h of birth and prior to feeding Enterococcus and Staphylococcus being the most common .

The perinatal microbiome and pregnancy moving beyond the vagi- nal microbiome.

The aim of this paper is to review the current litera- ture to find whether the meconium microbiota can be used as a source of information about the intrauterineenvironment of the fetus.What is the source of bacteria in the fetal gutThere is a general agreement that microbial coloniza- tion of the gut may occur in the fetus although the mechanisms by which bacteria reach the placenta amniotic fluid and fetus are still poorly understood .

Although the interest in the impact of the microbiota- host interaction on health and disease is growing  the pathomechanisms of bacterial colonization in utero the effects of the process on the normal fetal development and its disorders consequences for health in the neonatal period childhood and adult life or the therapeutic potential of modifying maternal microbiota during pregnancy remain to be elucidated.Understanding of the impact of microbiota on the fetal development might be easier if there were micro- biological and biochemical laboratory parameters spe- cific for the intrauterine environment.

has also been found in children with autism and their relatives compared to controls .Respiratory problems in neonates of mothers with eczema The development of asthma in 1-year-old genetically predisposed children depended on the bacterial composition of meconium at birth.

The development of allergy is preceded by abnormal increases in the levels of Clostridia and Staphylococcus aureus combined with decreased levels of Bifidobacterium Bacteroides or Lactobacilli .Preeclampsia The altered microbiome of the pla- centa and amniotic fluid the presence of the genera Bacillus Anaerobacillus StaphylococcusTable 1.
