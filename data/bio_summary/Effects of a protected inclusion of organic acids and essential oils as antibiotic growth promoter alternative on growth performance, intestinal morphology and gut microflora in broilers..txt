2009 thereby showing that a higher sIgA level implied that dietary inclusion of essential oils and organic acids addition improved intestinal tract health in broilers which was similar to the results that aminobutyric acid increased sIgA content in intestinal mucosa which showed an obvious reduction at first due to heat stress Chen et al.

Detailed procedures about intestinal morphology detection were based on a previous description Naghi Shokri et al.

Dietary thymol supplementation increased intestinal trypsin activity but did not affect other enzyme activities Lee et al.

Commercial essential oil improved pancreatic trypsin and amylase activities as well as intestinal maltase activity Jang et al.

On the other hand organic acids are usually used for regulating intestinal pH and increasing digestive enzyme activ- ity Alavi et al.

PCR-DGGE analysis in this study showed that microbial flora in the intestinal tract was changed after dietary inclusion of essential oils and organic acids supplementation and identified bands after sequence analysis mainly belonged to Lactobacillus.A previous study suggested that some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with Lactobacillus Torok et al.

The study had reported that Lactibacillus salivarius was associated with bile salt deconjugation and growth depression in broilers and its metabolic activity inAnimal Science Journal 2017 88 1414-1424c 2017 Japanese Society of Animal Science1422 Y. LIU et al.the small bowel could reduce concentrations of conju- gated bile salts impairing lipid absorption and leading to reduction in weight gain Guban et al.

Several studies have declared that selected essential oils seemed to have the advantage of inhibit- ing the growth of potential pathogens while only moderately influencing beneficial members of the intestinal microbiota Ouwehand et al.

C A or P Birds were offered a basal diet C basal diet with0.15 gkg enramycin premix A or basal diet with 0.30 gkg of the protected essential oils and organic acids mixture product P the same as in Figure 2.Table 4 Effects of inclusion product of organic acids and essential oils on the intestinal mucosa sIgA of broilers mg 100 mgDaysItemsCAPSEM P-valueabMean values within a row with different superscript letters were significantly different P  0.05.

What is more organic acid salts inhibited the growth of many intestinal bacteria and further decreased the inflammatory process Iji  Tivey 1998.In parallel with the results above the experimen- tal data showed an obvious rise of sIgA content in ileum mucosa of the product group at 21 and 42 days than th eantibiotics and product groups as well as in the duodenum at 42 days.
