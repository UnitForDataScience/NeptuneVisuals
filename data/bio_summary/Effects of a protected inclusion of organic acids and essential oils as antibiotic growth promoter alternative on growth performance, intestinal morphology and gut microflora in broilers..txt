Not only growth performance immune organ index and intestinal microbiota but also intestinal morphology digestive enzyme activities and mucosa secretory immunoglobulin A sIgA levels are all analyzed in this study.

Detailed procedures about intestinal morphology detection were based on a previous description Naghi Shokri et al.

Dietary thymol supplementation increased intestinal trypsin activity but did not affect other enzyme activities Lee et al.
