Because the majority of bile acids re-enter the body in the ileum it is conceivable that immune cells in this gut segment are exposed to particularly high concentra- tions of bile acids as compared to other parts of the intestine.between bile-acid-promoted ileal inflam- mation and the protective effect of Mdr1.

However some intestinal bacteria can metabolize primary bile acids into secondary bile acids a process that may help them escape bile-acid-mediated toxicity.

In the present study primary and secondary bile acids had similar effects on T cells in vitro however it is plausible that the microbiota affects the interaction of bile acids and lympho- cytes in vivo.Finally the question arises as to the relevance for human intestinal inflamma- tion.

report that absorption of bile acids in the ileum and the ensuing high concentration of bile acids in the lamina propria shapes the local tissue immune environment.

In this issue of Immunity show that bile acids trigger T cell-mediated inflammation at their site of active absorption in the ileum unless cells are protected by the membrane transporter Mdr1.In medieval physiology it was believed that a person's wellbeing and tempera- ment critically depended on the balance of four key body fluids phlegm blood black bile and yellow bile--the latter accounting for irascibility.

In this issue of Immunity show that bile acids are truly an important factor for T cell homeostasis in the small intestine and that their effects are counteracted by multidrug resistance protein 1 Mdr1.Mdr1 is a membrane transporter that pumps a range of diverse molecules out of the cell including xenobiotics meta- bolic products and toxins  .

At this location enterocytes actively import bile acids from the lumen through the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter Asbt and release them through the organic solute transporter alphabeta hetero- dimer Ostab into the interstitial space where they can interact with T cells II increasing reactive oxygen species inside the cell and generating damaged molecules.

checked in vitro the effects of bile acids on Mdr1 activity and on effector T cells.

They found that conjugated bile acids reduce Mdr1 activity.

Through their detergent property bile acids are toxic to bacterial and eukaryotic cells but toxicity was higher for T cells lacking Mdr1.
