E-mail HY are .40 of the genes of Caenorhabditis elegansstill without functional annotation and .60 without a described phenotype Petersen et al.

These usu- ally rely on an artificial environment consisting of agar plates supplemented with the bacterial food strain Escherichia coli and analysis of the canonical C. elegans strain  which shows numerous adaptations to the laboratory condi- tions Sterken et al.

The interest in C. elegans natural populations has especially gained momentum since 2005 when several articles on itsnatural distribution and population genetic characteristics were published Barriere and Felix 2005 Haber et al.

This hasbeen particularly well-documented for interactions of host organisms with their coevolving parasites and pathogens Woolhouse et al.
