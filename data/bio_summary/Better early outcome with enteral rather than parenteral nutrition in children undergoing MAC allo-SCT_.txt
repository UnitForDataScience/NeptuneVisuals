Patients andor parents provided informed written consent to authorize medical records to be used for research purposes.Matching criteriaEN patients were matched one-to-one with PN patients selected among the three centres.

Itis worth noting that the two sets of pairs overlapped for all path- ological related parameters.Mortality and morbidityIn comparison to the PN group the EN group featured a greaterLymphomas2 24 4Other malignancies6 65 5Non-malignant diseases7 77 7Disease status n ns1st CR48 4942 432nd CR31 3234 3523rd CR3 33 3Progressive disease7 78 8Disease status n 0.78D100 OS rate A p 14 0.013 99.0 vs. 86.4 and a trend to a lower D100 NRM rate p 14 0.066 1.0 vs. 7.2 B .CR or non-malignant disease or NA90 9389 92Incidences of aGvHD were significantly lower for all grades C D  and the gut localization was reduced p0.014.Among the EN patients 28 cases 29 received a further sup-Progressive disease7 78 8Number of transplantation n nsFirst94 9794 97Second3 33 3plement with PN in particular for vomiting n 14 14 for grades IIIeIV intestinal aGvHD n 14 11 and the rest for refusal of naso-gastric tube feeding n 14 3 .
