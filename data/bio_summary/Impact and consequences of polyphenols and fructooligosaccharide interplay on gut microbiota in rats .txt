Compared to content of each SCFA in Group FOS content of butyrate in Group FOSQ and propionic acid in Group FOSC significantly increased P  0.05 whereas that of acetic acid in Group FOSC decreased P  0.01.Among the groups who consumed a high-FOS diet Group FOSC showed significantly highest content of soluble carbo- hydrates SC and lowest content of soluble polysaccharides SP P  0.05 Fig.

The contents of SC and SP in Group FOSQ presented no significant difference when compared to those in Group FOS.Serum biochemical indicesWhen compared with those in the Group FOS concentrations of HDL in Group FOSQ and FOSC were significantly lower P  0.05.

The ratio of abdominal BW was lower in Group FOSC and FOSQ compared to that in Group FOS however no significant difference was found P  0.05.SCFA and soluble carbohydrates in fecesThe total SCFAs showed no significant difference between the Group FOSC and FOS but they significantly increased inGroup FOSQ Table 2.

Among these Group FOSQ not FOSC displayed a distribution of gut microbiota similar tothat of Group FOS Fig.

Additionally each group had its own unique OTUs including 61 OTUs in Group FOS 57 OTUs in Group FOSQ and 54 OTUs in Group FOSC.Animal growthAfter the ingestion of high-FOS diet body weights BW of rats in each group continuously increased Fig.

The effect of consuming FOS andor polyphenols on the health of hosts needs to be further explored.IntroductionThe human intestine harbors about 100 trillion bacteria.1 Imbalances of intestinal microbiota will lead to various chronic diseases including obesity diabetes inflammatory bowel disease and even colon cancer.2 Gut microbiota acts as media between diet and human health.3 They multiply by uti- lizing unabsorbed components of food in small intestine and then perform functions in the host body by degradative activi- ties that yield nutrients and metabolites and by interactions with the immune system.4 Hence maintenance of intestinalmicrobiota balance via different methods has attracted signifi-cant attention.Diet is important to shape the composition of gut micro- biota in humans and rodents.

It has been reported that NDCs including fructooligosaccharide FOS can alter gut microbiota composition.415Therefore FOS and polyphenols share three common characteristics 1 they remain unabsorbed or are unable to be completely absorbed in the small intestine of rodents 2 they reshape the composition of gut microbiota in large intes- tine and 3 they are beneficial for human health.

In our pre- vious studies polyphenols were discovered to alter the pathway of gut microbiota metabolizing NDCs FOS in vitro12however studies focusing on the combination effect of poly-phenols and FOS on gut microbiota in vivo have not been reported to date.
