Toll-like receptors are expressed by var- ious cells of the immune system including dendritic cells DCs macrophages T cells and B cells and also by epithelial cells .A variety of bacterial products have been reported as TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide LPS from gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycans from gram-positive bacteria or fla- gellin derived from flagellated bacterial species .

Compared to effector T cells such as TH17 cells which are reliant on glucose metabolism the generation of reg- ulatory CD4 T cells has been shown to be selectively dependent on lipid oxygenation .

SCFA are strong modulators of the intestinal immune system and their effects are coordinated by specific metabolicprograms of immune cells .The intestinal microbiota is also involved in the synthesis and the metabolism of various vitamins such as B-group vitamins and vitamin K. On the other hand vitamins have been shown to modulate the microbiota and to act directly on the immune sys- tem vitamin A and its down-stream metabolite retinoic acid RA are involved in multiple immune processes such as Treg homeostasis and IgA antibody production  .food componentspro- prebioticsmicrobiota exchangeIL-10metabolites bacterial productscytokinesfood componentsFig.

These cells are a subtype of effector T helper cells which express high levels of IL-17A and IL-17F and which are highly enriched in the inflamed mucosal tissue of IBD patients  .
