SCFA are strong modulators of the intestinal immune system and their effects are coordinated by specific metabolicprograms of immune cells .The intestinal microbiota is also involved in the synthesis and the metabolism of various vitamins such as B-group vitamins and vitamin K. On the other hand vitamins have been shown to modulate the microbiota and to act directly on the immune sys- tem vitamin A and its down-stream metabolite retinoic acid RA are involved in multiple immune processes such as Treg homeostasis and IgA antibody production  .food componentspro- prebioticsmicrobiota exchangeIL-10metabolites bacterial productscytokinesfood componentsFig.

Interestingly T cell-derived IL-22BP was shown to be upreg- ulated in IBD and to promote IBD via blockade of the bene- ficial effects of IL-22 .Resulting cytokines IL-10 and immune toleranceIntestinal homeostasis is the result of a fine-tuned balance of factors promoting immune responses and signals mediating immune tolerance.

For example in a mouse model that is sus- ceptible for colitis the fecal microbiota was characterized by expansion of the Prevotella genus and the TM7 phylum .Interaction between the immune system and the microbiotaThe immune system has several sensors which detect the microbiota and its changes and consequently can promote intestinal inflammation or maintain homeostasis.

Impaired microbial sensing has been shown to impact the microbial composition and to promote inflammation global deletion of inflammasome components such as ASC or NLRP6 a member of the NLR family asso- ciates with dysbiosis with microbial shifts and a subsequent colitis .Resulting cytokine IL-23 mediates the interaction between the microbiota and the immune systemIntestinal immune responses and intestinal tissue homeostasis are regulated by cytokines which are produced when the abovementioned sensory systems are engaged.

This article is an open access publicationAbstract The mucosal immune system and the microbiota in the intestinal tract have recently been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease IBD.

This reinforces the idea that a deregulated immune response to intestinal microbiota is involved in IBD pathogenesis .In this section we will refresh the knowledge on the intes- tinal microbiota how it interacts with the immune system and furthermore the role of the key cytokines IL-23 IL-17 IL-22 IL-10 which result from this interaction in the context of IBD.Intestinal microbiotaThe human body coexists with around 1013 bacterial organ- isms which colonize different sides of the body such as theintestine and the skin .

IL-23 promotes an immune response character- ized by the induction of other two key cytokines IL-17 and IL-These cytokines are secreted by both innate and adaptive immune cells and they will be further discussed in the follow- ing paragraphs.Resulting cytokine IL-17 and its protective and pathogenic propertiesIn particular the role of IL-17 in IBD became the subject of controversial debate.

Both adaptive immune cells and cells of the innate immune system can produce IL-22 and early studies demon- strated that adaptive and innate IL-22 protects from IBD .

1 Schematic overview of interactions between diet microbiota and immune system in the intestineDeciphering the role of food components in modulating the intestinal immune system might help to use this potential to expand treatment options for IBD.
