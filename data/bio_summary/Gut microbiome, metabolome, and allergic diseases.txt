glutamine reportedly is a nutrient necessary to induce il-10-producing intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine glutamate also has a potential to promote immune tolerance in gut-associated lymphoid tissue.although few data are available regarding how d-type or bacterial amino acids regulate allergic inflammation dietary intake of d-tryptophan from probiotic bacteria such as lactobacillus rhamnosus gg lactobacillus casei w56 reportedly concomitantly induced increased treg cell counts and decreased th2 responses in the gut and lung consequently cooperatively ameliorating allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness  .there- fore d-type amino acids derived from commensal bacteria in the gut might offer a means to regulate host allergic reactions.conclusioncommensal bacteria in the gut produce several beneficial me- tabolites that regulate allergic responses this effect is mediated at least in part by the induction of treg cells suppression of the th2- type phenotype up-regulation of il-10 expression and mainte- nance of the gut barrier function.

in another study an elevated enterobacteriaceaebacteroidaceae ratio in early infancy was associated with subsequent food sensitization.in addition some intestinal bacteria supply beneficial metabo- lites derived from the host's diet which contribute to the devel- opment and regulation of the host immune system through their effects on differentiation proliferation migration and effector functions.in this review we describe recent findings regarding how commensal bacteria and their metabolites regulate host im- mune responses and their possible involvement in the develop- ment and control of allergic diseases.1323-8930copyright c 2017 japanese society of allergology.

ehrlicha and borrelia burgdorferi diacylglycerol-containing glycolipids from streptococcus pneumoniae a tetra-mannosylated form of phosphatidylino- sitol from mycobacterium bovis and cholesteryl-a-glucoside from helicobacter pylori .compared with conventional mice germ-free mice have fewer inkt cells in the spleen liver and thymus suggesting that commensal bacteria are involved in the induction of inkt cells by producing their antigen.some studies show that inkt cells act as key pathogenic t cells and exacerbate allergic airway diseases by promoting the production of il-4 and il- 13 th2 cytokinesewhereas others suggest that inkt cells suppress ige production and induce the production of il-10 from b cells and treg cells .together these findings indicate that the type of lipid or timing of lipid exposure may determine the immunologic phenotype of inkt cells which have the potential to control allergic inflammation.immune regulation by short-chain fatty acidsshort-chain fatty acids scfas are 1e6 carbons in length.

organisms belonging tobacteroidetes and bifidobacteriaceae preferentially metabolized the fiber thereby increasing the concentration of scfas.there- fore commensal bacteria metabolize fiber to generate scfas and fiber reciprocally affects the composition of commensal bacteria in the gut.accumulating evidence indicates that scfas have several anti- allergic properties.

it has long been known that u3 fas have anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties.indeed we previ- ously reported that allergic diarrhea was ameliorated through the consumption of u3-enriched linseed oil.an additional analysis using lipidomics technology allowed us to identify 1718-epoxy- eicosatetraenoic acid as an anti-allergic lipid metabolite derived from eicosapentaenoic acid.although 1718-epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid likely is generated in the colon through the action of cytochrome p450several lines of evidence indicate that commensal bacteria participate in lcfa metabolism.

together these findings imply that microbe- dependent suppression of resolvin d1 production may be associ- ated with allergic inflammation.we also found that u6 fa-derived lipid metabolites are gener-ated by commensal bacteria especially lactic acid bacteria.for example lactobacillus plantarum generates conjugated linoleic acids oxo fas and hydroxy fas from u6 fas .

given that activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome on macrophages contributes to asthma exacerba- tionit may offer a promising approach for the regulation of other allergic diseases.lcfas have been proposed to modulate immune reactions via ppar family receptors which generally are negative regulators for allergic diseases.

in addition scfas enhance the induction and function of treg cells .e among scfas butyrate induced the differentiation of treg cells in vitro and in vivo with concurrent enhancement of histone h3 acetylation in the foxp3 locus .acetate increased the acetylation of the foxp3 promoter also likely through hdac9 inhibition .propi- onate increases the number of treg cells mediated through gpr43 on the cells .as mentioned above intestinal epithelial barrier is also important for prevention of the food allergy.mi- crobial butyrate and acetate enhance the epithelial barrier function via induction of physiological hypoxia in the intestinal epithelial cells .therefore scfas have beneficial effects such as treg cells induction and enhancement of the barrier function for allergic diseases.among commensal bacteria in the colon clostridia producescfas and indeed induce colonic treg cells leading to the sup- pression of inflammatoryand allergicresponses  .

mainly via the succinate metabolic pathway  .acetate is generated by many genera of intestinal organisms including bifidobacterium spp  .collectively commensal bacteria have the ability to produce different scfas via fermentation in the gut and thus to exert diverse anti-allergic properties.vitaminsthere are 13 essential vitamins for humans the hydrophobic vitaminsda d e and kdand the hydrophilic vitaminsdthe b family b1 b2 b3 b5 b6 b7 b9 and b12 and c. like mammals bacteria utilize vitamins for their biologic functions.

therefore it is plausible that the balance between commensal bacteria and dietary conditions determines the production of mi- crobial vitamin metabolites and subsequent regulation of immune responses and allergic conditions.bacterial amino acidshumans must obtain 20 amino acids as essential nutrients some of which alanine aspartate cysteine glutamate glutamic acid glycine and tryptophan are metabolized by commensal bacteria.ein addition all amino acids except glycine have two isoforms the l- and d-amino acids which are enantiomers.

accumulating evidence has refined our understanding of the relationship between allergic diseases and the gut microbiome.
