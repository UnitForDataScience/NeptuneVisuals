While multiple lessons from other organ systems have demonstrated the close interplay between different kingdoms virtually nothing is known of how urinary fungi influence urinary bacterial community composition and stability.Hopefully with a better understanding of the role of fungi in urinary tract disease will come the ability to use targeted manipulation of the mycobiome for therapeutic purpose as is becoming a reality in other organ systems.

In other disease systems the mycobiome is thought to interact with other biomes and the host to play a role in organ homeostasis and pathology further study will be needed to elucidate the role fungi play in bladder health and disease.Keywords Mycobiome fungi fungal microbiome urology urinary tract lower urinary tract symptom LUTSSubmitted Nov 18 2016.

In urinary samples the ratio of fungi to sloughed human urothelial and contaminating epithelial cells is unclear but presumed to be extremely low reducing the sensitivity of mycobiome analyses in lower urinary tract disease.Low abundance of source materialIn the gut metagenomics studies demonstrated that only0.1 of detectable sequences in the total microbiota were attributed to fungi 26 in contrast to the 99 that were bacterial.

Regardless these transformative results implicate a role for fungi in lower urinary tract symptomatology that was not previously recognized.We have performed a preliminary culture-independent characterization of urinary fungi from a range of asymptomatic subjects manuscript in preparation.

But is this the case for fungi in the urinary tract As early as the 1850s clinicians were able to demonstrate viable fungi in the urine of asymptomatic subjects and note alterations in fungal composition in association with diabetes and renal diseaseagain in the absence of overt infection 21.

As we learn more about the role of fungi in urinary tract disease novel potential therapeutic approaches such as fungus-specificAnnals of Translational Medicine Vol 5 No 2 January 2017Page 9 of 12vaccinations fungal probiotics or targeted antifungal drugs may become plausible adjunctive treatments.ConclusionsWhile long ignored fungi are an essential part of the human microbiota.

While this result only details a single aberrant patient the dramatic diversion of this subject's resident urinary fungi from the patterns seen in the majority of other subjects suggests that the composition of the urinary mycobiome is linked to changes in systemic physiology.

In 30 of the participants non-cultivatable fungi were 50 or more of the fungi identified.

Isolation of DNA from fungi can be even more challenging than from bacterial cells as fungi are often more structurally robust and difficult to lyse effectively.

Additional problems arise for fungi which have not been addressed or resolved in the literature given the lack of systematic nomenclature for fungi e.g.
