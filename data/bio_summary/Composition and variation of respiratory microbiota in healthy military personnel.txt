Samples from the anterior nares A are red samples from the nasopharynx N are blue and samples from the oropharynx samples T are green.

Abundant Moraxella in oropharyngeal samples of some subjects including children and pneu- monia patients was also observed in other studies  -.Further study of the respiratory microbiomes of the healthy garrisoned military population in this project will provide a baseline understanding of normal respiratory microbiota longitu- dinal within subject community composition stability and of variations in the population between individuals and across time.

This project aimed to charac- terize the composition and temporal variation of the normal military respiratory microbiota identify individuals with abnormal respiratory bacterial taxa collect comprehensive demo- graphic data and uncover associations between variables and profiles of respiratory bacterial communities.Materials and methodsSampling and DNA isolationThe study protocol WRAIR1914 and protocol amendment were approved by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research WRAIR Institutional Review Board.

Diversity analysis indicated a significant overlap between nasal and nasopha- ryngeal samples whereas oropharyngeal samples formed a cluster distinct from these two regions.

The diversity between samples b-diversity was ana- lyzed by using the QIIME implementation of UniFrac  and the weighted UniFrac distance as a measure of b-diversity.Results and discussionSubject recruitment and characteristicsA total of 1107 nasal oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs which represented 92.25 of the total number of planned samples 1200 were collected from 50 volunteers  .

Analysis of data quarter S1 visit 1 from 36 subjects with samples available for all four quarters showing the percentage of samples with a relative abundance of 20.5 or 21.0.

In addition the criteria to define extreme or unusual samples subjects or both need to be further explored.The inter-individual diversity b-diversity for 30 subjects 720 samples was computed by using weighted UniFrac distances and visualized in  using EMPeror .

The diamond symbol represents the median of the samples.in the oropharyngeal microbiota although various other bacteria were also present but at much lower levels .Overall bacterial taxa with an average relative abundance of 20.5 constituted over 90 of the respiratory microbiota for all 432 samples  .

We initiated a study to characterize the upper respiratory micro- biomes of healthy military personnel in a garrison environment in order to establish a baseline for future studies on the effects of specific activities and exposures on respiratory microbiota.We previously conducted a preliminary study of laboratory and data processinganalysis procedures .
