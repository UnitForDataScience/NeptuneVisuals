after continuous administration of a. muciniphila firmicutes abundance substantially increased 40 in group akk 25 in group control p  0.05 and the bacteroidetes proportion decreased 47 in group akk 66 in group control p  0.05. additionally abundance of spirochaetae and verrucomicrobia was also significantly elevated due to the treatment .

group akk a. muciniphila con a mice were administrated 3109 cfu a. muciniphila suspended in 0.2 ml sterile anaerobic pbs by oral gavage per day while mice in group control pbs con a and group normal pbs pbs were given an equivalent volume of sterile anaerobic pbs instead.

however there was only sporadic degeneration and the inflammatory infiltration was much milder in the akk group compared to that of the control group.

accordingly plasma concentration of lps was markedly decreased in group akk compared to group control  providing extra evidence of a strengthened barrier function after a. muciniphila supplement.previous studies showed that colonization of a. muciniphila aids in the refreshment and reshaping of the mucus layer and mucus production was proposed to be involved in the colonization resistance  .

there was extensive damage in group control but only sporadic apoptosis was observed in group akk scale bar 100 um.

percentage of apoptotic cells in the liver was significantly lower in group akk n  7-8 per group.

mrna level of an important anti-apoptotic factor bcl-2 was markedly reduced in group control whereas it was significantly elevated in group akk.

strikingly this protective layer evidently thickened in the akk group compared with that of the control group indicating that pretreatment strengthenedthe intestinal barrier .

however there was no significantly different expression of antimicrobial peptides such as lyz1 defa and reg3g between group akk and control with the exception that pla2g2 was much lower in group akk supplementary figure 2.a.

in contrast to the control group a. muciniphila administration significantly improved commensal richness and diversity as shown by consistently elevated otus ace and shannon indexes in the akk group .

we further evaluated pairwise variation between samples based on their cages and pretreatments by weightedtable 1  bacterial translocation and systemic endotoxin among groups.renal nnanaerobe0 0842.9 370 070.051aerobe0 0871.4 5714.3 170.031lps euml0.85 - 0.280.12 - 0.08 0.032comparison between group control and akk by chi-square test for categorical data and mann-whitney test for lps  lps in group normal was under the detectable line 0.007 euml.unifrac distances .

bacteroidetes and firmicutes were separately enriched in group control and group akk.

furthermore staphylococcaceae and bacteroidaless247group were relatively deficient in group akk compared to that of group control.a.

additionally there was a significantly higher mrna level of ifn-g in livers from the group control compared to that of group akk.
