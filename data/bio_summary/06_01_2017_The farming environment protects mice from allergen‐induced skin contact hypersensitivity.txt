The microbial environment provided by farm animals is crucial to induce this protective effect although underlying immune mechanisms remain elusive.Objective To establish a mouse model of global exposure to the farming environment and to study immunologic changes linked to protection of allergy.Methods Mice colonies were bred in parallel in a farm cowshed and the university animal facility AF.

Mice transfers between the AF and the farm showed a better protection when mice were moved to the farm early in life.

Microbiome analysis showed differences between 4 and 20 weeks old mice and between farm and AF mice with an increased number of Murine mastadenovirus B in young farm mice exclusively.Conclusion The farming environment provides a strong allergy protective IL-22 stimulus and generates activated CD4 T cells.

As the only notable difference in the farm offsprings were born only between spring and fall whereas birth occurred throughout the year at the AF.Farming environment protects mice for allergen-induced skin contact hypersensitivityTo assess whether the farm environment was protective for the induction of allergies we used a skin allergy model with primary sensitization with FITC a skinFig.

D ear thickening difference of the challenged ear with the control ear in animals either from the AF group A and F2 animals bred at the farm group B or mice transferred to the farm at various ages group C to E. Results represent medians of 12-15 micegroup.

Transfer to the farm at 2 days of life with the mothers followed by a 4 weeksacclimation period gave the same protection than being born in the farm Fig.

We then looked at subtypes of CD3 cells and found that while the percentage of CD8 cells was lower the CD4 cell percentage was increased in the farm mice suggesting an activation of CD4 cells in the farm environment.

These data suggest that exposure to cowshed environmental factors early in life favours the expansion of activated T cells.Activated T cells have an environment-specific pattern of cytokine productionFollowing the observation that activated T cells were enhanced in farm mice we assessed the cytokine pro- duction pattern of T cells from 4 and 20 weeks old AF and farm mice Fig.

IL-17 and IL-22 production tended to be enhanced in 4 weeks old farm mice and inhibited in 20 weeks old farm mice with a statistically significant difference only for IL-22.

In mice from the three other subgroups 20-week-old farm mice and 4- and 20-week- old AF mice Mastadenovirus remained undetected and viruses in general had much lower counts Table 1 and Table S1.DiscussionBeing born and growing up in a farm provides probably the best protection from allergies in young children.
