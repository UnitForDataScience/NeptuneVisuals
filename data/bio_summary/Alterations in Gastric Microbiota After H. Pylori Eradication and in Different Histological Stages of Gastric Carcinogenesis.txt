The 2-D plot of the first two principal coordinates shows a clear divergence of can- cer samples with other samples 1c.

The meaningof box is the same with b Donut chart of major bacterial phyla in pre- and post-eradication samples as well as normal control samples.

The meaning of box is the same with A. c The P-values between different groups were shown.

Moreover it remains to be determined whether the disturbed gastric microbiota in HP infected subjects could be reversed by HP eradication therapy.This study attempted to characterize the changes in gastric microbiota after HP eradication and the changes in gastric microbiota in individuals with different histological stages of gastric carcinogenesis.ResultsPatients' samples.We sequenced 60 biopsy samples from 33 individuals including subjects with HP-associated chronic gastritis gastric IM gastric adenocarcinoma and HP-negative controls1Department of Medicine The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong.

a The relative abundance distribution of major genera across 60 sequencing samples.

The E suffix represents samples after HP eradication.

b The Veen plot of common OTUs among different group of samples.

The dendrogram graphs show that samples were converged according to both HP and disease states Supplementary Figure 5.

The LEfSe analysis on OTUs identified 13 high abundance OTUs enriched in cancer samples compared with other histological sam- ples Supplementary Figure 7.

The average relative abundance of Helicobactera decreased from 83.70 in the pre-treatment to 6.88 in the post treatment samples 3a.
