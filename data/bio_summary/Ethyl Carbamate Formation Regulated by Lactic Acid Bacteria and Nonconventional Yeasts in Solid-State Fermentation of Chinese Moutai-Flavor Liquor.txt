Most of the urea was produced during fermentation via the catabolism of arginine by microorganisms such as yeasts.Because excessive accumulation of urea in cells is toxic excess urea is secreted to the extracellular space eventually leading to a significant increase in urea content in the fermentation system.Therefore we investigated the dynamics of the concentration of arginine present during the heaping and fermentation of Moutai-flavor liquor .

The arginine deiminase pathway in the malolactic fermentation of wine has been characterized in certain isolates including Oenococcus oeni.-The metabolism of arginine and the urea cycle are of oenological concern because they can result in the excretion of citrulline and urea which can spontaneously react with ethanol to form EC.In this study we employed amplicon and metatranscriptomic sequencing to explore nitrogen regulation in fermentation microbiota that produce and degrade EC precursors particularly urea.

The change in urea concentration during the fermentation was significant showing an average increase of 101.37 mg kg-1during the first 15 days of the fermentation and an averagedecrease of 96.57 mg kg-1 on days 15-30.

plantarum L. fermentum and L. buchneri in the Moutai-flavor liquor fermentation are also present in many other kinds of fermented foods.Strains of these bacteria from Moutai-flavor liquor fermentation could be used as the reference to study microbial function in other fermented foods.Dominant Nonconventional Yeasts Were Functional Regulators of the Production of Urea.

pombe C- 11 Z. bailii C-7 and P. kudriavzevii C-16 could therefore reduce the urea content in the fermentation process.Herein amplicon sequencing combined with metatranscrip- tomic sequencing was applied to determine the diversity and dynamics of the fermentation microbiota involved in the production of Moutai-flavor liquor.

As traditional fermented alcoholic beverages are particularly important sources of EC intake the health risks posed by this EC are of concern.Solid-state fermentation SSF is a commonly used technology for the production of traditional alcoholic beverages and can improve the texture and flavor of the product.Chinese Moutai-flavor liquor 53 alcohol by volume production is a typical SSF process originating from ancient fermented beverages and driven by multistrain microbial communities.

Samples were collected from the same batch in two distinct phases of liquor production namely heaping and fermentation.

Fermentation-phase samples were the grain mixture fermented in the anaerobic environment and taken at 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 32 days the latter being the end of the fermentation.

The fermentation of Chinese liquor was simulated as a coculture system of the main brewing microorganisms.

The solid-state fermentation medium was prepared as follows sorghum 250 g was added to hot water 350 mL 70-80 degC soaked for 24 h and sterilized at 121 degC for 20 min.
