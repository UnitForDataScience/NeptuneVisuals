In this work we introduce Parallel-META 3 a comprehensive and fully automatic computational toolkit for rapid data mining among metagenomic datasets with advanced features including 16S rRNA extraction for shotgun sequences 16S rRNA copy number calibration 16S rRNA based functional prediction diversity statistics bio-marker selection interaction network construction vector-graph-based visualizationand parallel computing.

A and B Partition of b diversity on taxonomy and functions based on Meta-Storms distances of Dataset 1 C and D Shannon index a diversity of Dataset1 on genus level and pathway level E and F Comparison of 16S rRNA reads from V1-V3 region Dataset 1and V3-V5 region Dataset 2 on taxonomical a diversity and b diversity.

Dataset 3 contained 528 human gut 16S rRNA amplicon samples from healthy adults children less than 3 years old C-3 and children of 3-17 years old C-17 from three countries Malawi USA and Venezuela produced by Yatsunenko et al.These three datasets were employed as representatives of 16S rRNA amplicon based microbiome data.On the other hand in order to test the performance on shotgun metagenomics data Datasets 4 was included which contained 10 artificial metagenomic shotgun samples that were simulated with nine organisms using Dwgsimversion 0.1.8.

These 10 samples were divided into two groups based on proportion of organisms to test the sensitivity of Parallel-META 3 in distinguishing samples with different community patterns detailed design of simulation in Table S1 of Supplementary file S1.Results of 16S rRNA amplicon samples from the first three datasets were generated via Parallel-META 3 ver- sion 3.3.2 then they were compared to the taxonomical structure reported by QIIMEversion 1.9.0 and func- tional profiles predicted by PICRUStversion 1.0 that worked the benchmark.

Compared to previous versions its advanced features include 16S rRNA copy number calibration 16S rRNA based functional prediction diversity statistics biomarkers selection and data visualization based on high-quality vector graphs.

For shotgun sequences Parallel-MEA 3 first constructs Hidden Markov Models using all bacterial 16S rRNA sequences of SILVAversion 123 and predicts the 16S rRNA gene fragments in metagenomic shotgun samples from both the forward sequences and reversed complementary sequences by HMMERversion 3.1 e-value  1e-5.

Parallel-META 3 analysis results at the genus level C. b diversity comparison via PCA among Parallel-META 3 16S rRNA copy number calibration enabled the default option Parallel-META 3 16S rRNA copy number calibration disabled and simulation design.metagenomic shotgun sequences for profiling.

Since change in microbial diversity in microbiota samples has been linked to several human diseases we assessed the capability of Parallel-META 3 in a diversity and b diversity statistics via both taxonomical structure and predicted functional profiles.

This acceleration demonstrated the capability of Parallel-META 3 on rapid evaluation of input samples which is essential for in-depth data mining with massive amount of sam- ples and complex community structures.Identification of microbiota structure pattern from 16S rRNA amplicon samples.

We verified the overall taxonomical patterns and predicted metabolic profiles of three 16S rRNA amplicon datasets generated by Parallel-META 3 with the benchmark from both a diversity and b diversity aspects.
