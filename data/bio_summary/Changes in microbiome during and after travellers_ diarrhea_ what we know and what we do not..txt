More importantly these studies highlight what is remaining to be elucidated.Key words Travellers diarrhea microbiomeIntroductionThere have been many studies on the microbiome and there have been many studies of travellers' diarrhea TD however there have been few studies that combine the examination of the host microbiome before during or after TD.

Overall this study is one of the most comprehensive 16S rRNA TD pathogen based stud- ies to date.Recovery-Based StudiesWhile the use of prospective-based challenge studies are an opti- mal controlled situation in examining the changes of the micro- biome in controlled conditions most studies completed on the topic of TD and microbiome or diarrhea and the microbiome in general are termed recovery studies.

Recent attempts have been made to extensively cul- ture and characterize the organisms in the gastrointestinal tract and provide a resource for the community to access these data and isolates.Further efforts of this nature will facilitate our understanding of the microbiome in general and place metage- nomic studies into context with the functional studies of TD.ConclusionsWhile the described studies on the pathogen and community dy- namics are often limited in scope and number of subjects the potential to use these data as a model to being to understand and develop potential diagnostics based on the community structure with the 16S rRNA or metagenomic sequencing or in the future with metatranscriptomics and metabolomics are pos- sible.

However in order for there to be a deeper understanding of the changes in the microbiome and what factors are import- ant in the changes of the microbiome large scale controlledpathogen challenge studies are the most controlled studies to complete with the greatest likelihood of success of identification of the important features of the microbiome associated with TD.

There were also large numbers of samples in this study that were from TD without any known pathogen so the interpretation of the microbiome data from these studies and comparison to TD samples with a known pathogens is difficult.

In addition while these studies were not meant to identify novel pathogens these types of TD samples provide the opportunity to identify novel associations of TD and previously unknown pathogens or isolates of species not previously known as pathogens.

In addition to the process of travel there are mul- tiple pathogens that have been identified to be associated with TD enterotoxigenic E coli Shigella species Campylobacter spe- cies Norovirus and other viral vectors as well as studies that suggest that a significant number of TD cases have no known causegenetic variation in terms of the isolate that canwill in- fect any one person dose delivery vehicle food water other etc.

When microbiota analyses were completed by Youmans et al.to examine the diversity of the community com- ponents known as alpha and beta diversity all samples from in- dividuals with TD were similar suggesting that TD results in similar changes in the microbiota irrespective of the pathogen.While this study was one of the first to provide a detailed examination of the microbiota during TD there are shortcom- ings.

This review provides a brief overview of the state of the use of microbiome studies using Travellers Diarrhea samples and what those studies have told us.

Searching of the PubMed databases with the key terms of diarrhea identifies100 000 published studies if the word microbiome is then added to the search fewer than 700 publications are identified and those with the word enteric identify 100 studies with these key words .
