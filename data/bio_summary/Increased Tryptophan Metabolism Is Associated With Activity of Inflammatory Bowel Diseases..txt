Kynurenic acid KYA serum levels CD active vs control P 9.4e-6 inactive vs control P .00054 active vs inactive P .81 UC active vs control P .66 inactive vs control P .69 active vs inactive P .11 and PIC serum levels were reduced only in CD CD active vs control P 2e-7 inactive vs control P 1.8e-7 active vs inactive P .39 UC active vs control P .1 inactive vs control P .12 active vs inactive P 1.

The reduction of TRP was related to disease activity by analysis of the full set of both CD and UC patients including the follow-up samples CD control vsinactive CD n 490 P .016 control vs active CD n 511 P  .001 active vs inactive CD n 114 P .01 UC control vs inactive UC n 428 P .772 control vs active UC n 420 P  .001 active vs inactive UC n 65 P .068 .

From these data dietary consumption of TRP was not significantly different between active and inactive IBD Supplementary Table 2.Tryptophan Receptor Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 19System B0 Neutral Amino Acid Transporter 1 and Degrading Enzymes Tryptophan 23-Dioxygenase-2 and Indoleamine 23-Dioxygenase-1The messenger RNA of the neutral amino acid trans- porter SLC6A19B0AT1 was significantly down-regulated in biopsies from patients with active CD and UC in comparison with noninflamed healthy controls active CD vs control P 2.16 10-03 active UC vs control P 2.68 10-06 and nonspecific inflammatory controls cytomegalovirus and C difficile related infectious diarrhea active CD vs inflammation controls P .01 active UC vs inflammation controls P  .0001 too.

The messenger RNA of TDO2 was significantly down-regulated in active CD and UC P 1.11 10-06 and P 3.64 10-08 respectively whereas IDO1 transcript levels were up-regulated CD P 14 5.86 x 10-06 UC P 14 3.66 x 10-07 .Microbiome and TryptophanIn order to identify the relation of serum TRP levels and gut microbial communities we compared fecal micro- biota communities from a cohort of 18 IBD patients strati- fied into low 14.6 32.1 mgmL intermediate 40.9 49.3 mgmL and high 52.2 65.6 mgmL TRP levels.

QUI serum levels were strongly increased CD active vs control P 7.7e-28 inactive vs control P 8.4e-25 active vs inactive P .051 UC active vs control P 7.5e-17 inactive vs control P 2.3e-14 active vs inactive P .16.

For analysis of primary nonresponse 17 IBD patients CD n 9 and UC n 8 only infliximab were used.Paired stool and serum samples were collected from a subset of n 18 active patients diagnosed with active UC n 10 and CD n 8 before therapy induction to investigate the correlation of serum TRP levels and microbiota composi- tion.
