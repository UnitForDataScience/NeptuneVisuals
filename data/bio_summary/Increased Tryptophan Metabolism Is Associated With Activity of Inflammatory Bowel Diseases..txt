it must be noted however that due to the high correlation between inflammatory ac- tivity and trp levels this analysis does not necessarily imply a direct influence of trp serum levels on fecal microbial composition.trp metabolites and il22we investigated trp metabolites in the serum of 148 pa- tients with ibd  supplementary table 3. we noticed an altered activity of the kyn pathway with a significantly higher kyntrp ratio in ibd vs control which was related todisease activity and stronger in cd active p 6.2 10-7 inactive p .024 than in uc active p 6 10-6 inactive p .026. we detected strongly increased serum levels of qui more pronounced in cd vs control active p7.7 10-28 inactive p 8.4 10-25 than in uc vs control active p 7.5 10-17 inactive p 2.3 10-14. serum levels of pic weresignificantly reducedin cd vs control active p 2 10-7 inactive p 1.8 10-7 as were levels for kynurenic acid active cd p 9.4 10-6 inactive cd p.0005.

active disease was defined as crp 5 mgl and or cdai 150 points andor hbi 5 points for cd and as crp 5 mgl andor cai 5 points for uc respectively  supplementary figure 3. trp metabolites were analyzed in 148 of the 535 patients cd n81 uc n67 and in the 100 healthy controls.

we collected the potsdam dietary question- naire from 114 patients to examine a potential relationship between food-based intake of trp and disease activity active ibd cd n 20 uc n 11 and inactive ibd cd n 63 uc n 20. fifty questionnaires were collected at the time or trp sampling as part of an independently conducted master's thesis.

reduction of trp serum levels could be caused by different factors one explanation might be a reduced nutritional state of cd patients in comparison with uc.in dietary questionnaires we did not detect a significant difference in trp consumption during active disease in either cd or in uc.
