one of the main mechanisms pos- tulated may involve increased glucagon-like peptide 1 glp-1 secretion from enteroendocrine l-cells to improve carbohydrate metabolism decrease glucotoxicity and increase insulin sensitivity of target cells.6 other proposed mechanisms to explain the action of probiotics on diabetes relate to anti-inflammatory antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects and alteration of the expression of some genes involved in diabetes.7-10moreover probiotic intake affects the structure of the gut flora which might improve the integrity of the intestinal epithelium weaken the immune responses and diminish the toll-like recep- tor 4 pathway which in turn reduces pro-inflammatory signaling and enhances insulin sensitivity.1112given the various statements regarding the effects of probiot- ics on diabetes that have been made the aim of the present study was to focus on possible mechanisms for probiotics that might explain some of their beneficial effects in relation to diabetes in the form of a review.objectivethe aim of the present study was to focus on possible mecha- nisms for probiotics that might explain some of their beneficial effects in relation to diabetes in the form of a narrative review.methodssearch strategya search of the electronic databases medline via pubmed and cochrane library via wiley and the electronic reposi- tories web of science and google scholar was performed.

the search was last performed in october 2016 using combinations of search terms including probiotics or probiotic or lactic acid bacteria or lactobacillus or lactobacilli or bifido- bacterium or bifidobacteria and diabetes mellitus without any restrictions in order to find studies focusing on the mecha- nisms linking probiotics with diabetes.eligibility criteriastudies were included if they assessed the effect of a single or combination of live probiotics on diabetes.

in addition evaluation of the mechanism of action for probiotics both in healthy subjects and in diabetic patients so as to address the influence of these microorganisms on gene expression for different pathways is needed in order to better understand the role that probiotics might have in prevention and treatment of diabetes.conclusionsin conclusion there is some evidence suggesting various poten- tial mechanisms of action for probiotics in relation to diabetes prevention and treatment.

therefore improvement of oxidative stress status may contribute towards diabetes management.4243tabuchi et al.36 showed that lactobacillus gg lowered the level of mda per gram of liver weight which conferred suppression of oxidative stress and improved glucose tolerance.other authors concluded that the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus casei on the incidence of diabetes was partially depen- dent on prevention of nitric oxide production given that this is a free radical that is involved in the ss-cell destruction process in islets of langerhans.3744on the other hand foods containing probiotics have been shown to protect against indices relating to diabetes.

the anti-diabetic mechanisms for probiotics reported encompass intraluminal and direct effects on the intestinal mucosa and microbiota n  13 anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory ef- fects n  10 antioxidative effects n  5 effects on endoplasmic reticulum er stress and expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance n  6 with some studies pointing to more than one mechanism.conclusion the results may throw some light on the capacity of probiotics as a novel approach to- wards controlling diabetes.

use of probiotics has been suggested as one of the approaches towards modifying the clonal flora.3diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease with major complications largely influenced by glycemic measures.1 the global burden of disease 2015 study gbd 2015 showed that diabetes was among the leading causes of years of life lost ylls in most regions.2 also diabetes was shown to be a leading cause of dis- ability-adjusted life years dalys for which the observed burden exceeded expected levels in many localities.3 the rise in diabetes prevalence is set to pose one of the most important challenges to healthcare systems over the coming years.4a growing body of evidence suggests that favorable associa- tions exist between probiotic consumption and metabolic profile among diabetes subjects.5 however the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics on glycemia-related param- eters are not fully understood.

tlr-mediated effects of probiotics involve immune-regulatory cytokines such as interleukin il-10 and transforming growth factor tgf-b and some regulatory t cells under the experimental conditions that result in protection from spontaneous diabetes.32the effects of probiotics on oxidative stressin diabetes the free radicals that are generated cause lipid per- oxidation and malondialdehyde mda production.

these findings indicated that this drink had good antioxidant properties.33probiotic milk has consistently been found to exert antioxi- dant effects through inhibiting lipid peroxidation and preserv- ing the activity of antioxidant enzymes including sod gpx and catalase cat.34the effects of probiotics on gene expressionsome studies on interactions between probiotics and gene expres- sion have suggested that type 2 diabetes in rats is ameliorated through mrna upregulation of glucose transporter-4 glut-4 through lactobacillus plantarum ncu116 treatment.23 this has a critical role in glucose uptake.45 moreover ncu can regulate glu- cose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in diabetic rats via regu- lating ppar-a and ppar-g gene expression.

finally six studies suggested that probiotics might have effects through altering the expression of genes involved in er stress and glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance.the strengths of this review include its use of an outcome clas- sification for different possible mechanisms of probiotics in rela- tion to diabetes.
