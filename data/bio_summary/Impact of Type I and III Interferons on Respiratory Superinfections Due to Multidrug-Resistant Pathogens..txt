DNA is capable of activating type I IFN for both S. aureus and S. pneumoniae TLR9 mediates IFN re- sponses associated with S. aureus and STING mediates IFN responses to S. pneumoniae   .

Studies have shown that influ- enza increases the susceptibility to S. aureus or S. pneumoniae infection and that type I and III IFNs play a major role in this observation -.TYPE I AND III IFN SIGNALING INFLUENCE THE NASAL MICROBIOME AND COLONIZATION DENSITYUpper airway tract colonization with gram-positive organisms is a major risk factor for subsequent aspiration and pneumonia.

Antecedent influenza virus infection has been shown to increase colonization and aspiration of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae into the airway from the nasopharynx     and has been linked to multiple consequences of the IFN cascade.

Type I IFNs exerted their effect by decreasing production of the major macrophage chemokine CCL2 an observation that was demonstrated directly in vitro with purified IFN-b preventing production of CCL2 by macro- phages in response to infection .CONCLUSIONSSecondary infections resulting from S. aureus and S. pneumo- niae are a major complication of influenza virus infection.

Both type I and III IFN signaling were similarly found to inhibit clearance of S. aureus from the nasopharynx in the context of superinfection .EFFECTS OF TYPE III IFN ON THE NASAL MICROBIOMEInfluenza is able to alter the mouse nasal microbiome via a type III IFN-STAT1-dependent mechanism.
