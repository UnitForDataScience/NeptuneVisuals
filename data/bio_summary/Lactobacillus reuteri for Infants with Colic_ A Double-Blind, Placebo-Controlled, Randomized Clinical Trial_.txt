two meta-analyses have suggested that lactobacillus reuteri strain deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen dsm 17938 significantly reduces infant crying and fussing time in breast-fed infants with colic.34an abnormal fecal microbial community in babies with colic was first postu- lated by savino et al who showed increased escherichia coli and reduced lactobacilli.5 our previous study suggested increased klebsiella and reduced microbial diver- sity in these infants.6 therefore we postulated that children with colic may have an abnormal gut microbiome the intestine may be inflamed in colicky babies based on a high fecal calprotectin6 and l reuteri strain dsm 17938 may reduce gut in- flammation associated with this dysbiosis.7-9 during the review of our proposal the food and drug administration fda asked whether an immunosuppresive170 volume 191  december 2017effect of l reuteri strain dsm 17938 potentially produced by increased regulatory t cells7 could predispose newborn infants to more infections lactic acidosis or even lactobacillus bacteremia.the aim of this study was therefore to demonstrate the safety of a liquid probiotic l reuteri strain dsm 17938 given over a 42-day period in infants with colic.

five 71 patients in the placebo group experienced at least 1 ae and 10 77 patients in l reuteri strain dsm 17938 group experienced at least 1 ae p  1.00. the average number of aes in l reuteri strain dsm 17938 group and placebo were2.7 and 1.6 respectively and the rr of experiencing ae in l reuteri strain dsm 17938 group compared with the placebo group was not significantly different rr 1.71 95 ci 0.63- 4.67 p  .292.at baseline of the 20 infants that we randomized 11 55 had neutropenia absolute neutrophil count anc  1500 mm3 .

no group to date has performed endoscopy or colonoscopy on infants with colic to directly address the question of inflammation.we found that l reuteri strain dsm 17938 treatment did not change the percentage of foxp3tregs in peripheral blood compared with placebo but the percentages of cd25 and helios populations among foxp3tregs were both lower in l reuteri strain dsm 17938 groups compared with placebo group at day 42. in human cd4 cells the level of helios ex- pression is positively associated with cd25 expression.33 helios expression in human and murine tregs discriminates thymic- derived ntregs helios from inducible tregs helios- itregs.3334 our results therefore indicate that inducible tregs in the gut may be shaped by probiotic.previously moore et al found evidence of elevated breath hydrogen suggesting an abnormal population of colonic micro- organisms in their children with colic.35 in a previous report we found klebsiella in 8 of 17 infants with colic compared with 1 of 18 without colic.6 we are aware of several previous studies of the fecal microbial composition of infants with colic from other centers.

savino et al showed that there were decreased lactobacilli and increased anaerobic gram-negative organ- isms in the stools of infants with colic and later found lacto- bacillus brevis and lactococcus lactis were present only in colicky infants and lactobacillus acidophilus was found only in healthy infants.3637 however roos et al and sung et al did not find changes in fecal microbiota or escherichia numbers respectively.3839 in the current study definitive effects of l reuteri strain dsm 17938 on alpha- or beta-diversity or relative com- position of the different species could not be addressed because of a poorly diverse microbial population small numbers of ob- servations and differential community composition at the time of randomization similar to roos et al.38our study differed from some previously published l reuteri strain dsm 17938 trials in that we found 66 of infants in the placebo group had resolution of their colic by 3 weeks.

the infant had been given a probiotic to prevent necro- tizing enterocolitis but testing of the same lot of unopened probiotic powder revealed contamination with r oryzae.25none of the 20 studies in the meta-analysis of probiotics used to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis by wang et al and none of the l reuteri strain 17938 colic trials in the systematic reviews by xu et al or by harb et al were conducted in the us most likely because of the requirement for us food and drug administration approval.42627 our study demonstrated that in a small but carefully selected sample of healthy newborns with 42 days of daily treatment with l reuteri strain dsm 17938 there was no increase in the rate of infection lactic acidosis gastrointestinal symptoms or other aes.

at day 42 plasma il-2 level was significantly lower in the l reuteri strain dsm 17938- treated group helios-positive thymus-derived tregs were de-creased by 10-20 and total treg  remained the same in the l reuteri strain dsm 17938-treated group.we assessed safety by comparing the number of aes in the 2 arms.

mild neutropenia generally has been defined as an anc  1500mm3 in children.19 at base- line 8 infants had peripheral blood neutropenia 6 l reuteri strain dsm 17938-treated and 2 placebo-treated a finding that improved in the l reuteri strain dsm 17938-treated group with time whereas in the placebo group we found that 3 of 4 cases who had blood samples available at study beginning and completion had either no change or a decrease in anc.

eleven of the 20 55 presented with low absolute neutrophil counts 1500 mm3 which resolved in all subjects by day 176. l reuteri strain dsm 17938 produced no severe adverse events and did not significantly change crying time plasma bicarbonate or inflammatory biomarkers.

in the infants with dominant fecal gram negatives klebsiella proteus and veillonella resolution of colic was associated with marked decreases in these organisms.conclusions daily administration of l reuteri strain dsm 17938 appears to be safe in newborn infants with colicincluding those with neutropenia which frequently coexists.

in addition we sought to investigate biomarkers that might give insight into the mecha- nism of action of l reuteri strain dsm 17938 related to infant colic.

clinical laboratory results generally were considered abnor- mal if they were 2 times the upper limit in the memorial hermann laboratory directory of services for aspartate ami- notransferase and alanine aminotransferase 20 for com- plete blood count and electrolytes or 30 for glucose or kidney tests based on healthy infants.11at the baseline visit eligible subjects randomly were as- signed to probiotic l reuteri strain dsm 17938 or placebo sunflower oil.

to detect poten- tial differences in safety subjects were randomized via a ratio of 21 treatment to placebo.the dose of l reuteri strain dsm 17938 was approxi- mately 5 x 108 colony-forming units given as 5 drops or placebo sunflower oil provided by biogaia ab stock- holm sweden.

all l reuteri strain dsm 17938 vials contained5 x 108 colony-forming units per day during treatment documented by anaerobic cultures of every fifth returned vial.safety primary outcome was defined by strict monitor- ing of aes and severe aes throughout the study.
