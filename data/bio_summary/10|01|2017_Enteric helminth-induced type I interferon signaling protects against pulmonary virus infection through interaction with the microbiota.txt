In mice coinfected with H polygyrus RSV-induced increases in NK cell B-cell see  A and B in this article's Online Repository at  and CD81 T-cell numbers were absent  C and the increase in cDC numbers was significantly reduced  D. Early proinflammatory cytokine production of IL-6 and TNF-a on day 2 was induced to a significantly lower level in H polygyrus-infected mice compared with those infected with RSV alone see  C and D. IFN-g levels increased with RSV infection but were not significantly suppressed in coinfected mice indicating selective inhibition of a pathway independent of IFN-g see  E.Given these changes in RSV-induced signs of disease we investigated whether H polygyrus suppresses the immune response or directly alters the magnitude of RSV infection.

Statistical significance of differences between groups was determined in Fig 5 A by using 1-way ANOVA with the Tukey post hoc test and in Fig 5 B-D by using the unpaired t test.P  .05 and P  .001.role in protection we studied RSV infection in germ-free mice in the presence or absence of H polygyrus infection.In contrast to fully colonized SPF mice in germ-free mice RSV titers and RSV L gene expression were not suppressed by H polygyrus coinfection  A and B.

Furthermore the ISG induction seen in wild-type mice is also lost in Ifnar22 mice after H polygyrus infection  B and C.The cathelicidin-related AMP is upregulated during H polygyrus infection but is not required for expression of type I interferon and ISGsCathelicidins are a family of small cationic peptides with microbicidal and immunomodulatory properties.

Lung RSV titers as assessed by using the plaque assay were reduced after H polygyrus infection without changes in the kinetics of replication  E. In C57BL6 mice ex vivo plaque assays for RSVare unreliable because of the low viral loadand therefore we tested the effects of coinfection in C57BL6 mice by measuring expression of the RSV L gene in the lung by RT-PCR as an indicator of viral load.

L gene expression was significantly reduced in H polygyrus-infected mice in this strain see  F.These findings demonstrate a potent inhibition of RSV-induced disease early proinflammatory cytokine production and recruitment of a broad range of immune cells to the lung in the setting of H polygyrus coinfection presumably because of an early reduction in viral infection.Adaptive immune responses including TH2 responses are not required for H polygyrus- induced protection against RSV infectionType 2 immune responses are crucial during most helminth infections aiding in wound healing and immunity to helminths.Il4ra-deficient mice cannot respond to IL-4 or IL-13 signals and present strongly diminished type 2 immune responses.

The RSV load was similar between Il33r22 and wild-type control mice see  C and was reduced to similar levels in both groups by H polygyrus coinfection indicating that there is no essential role for IL-33 in protection against RSV infection.To determine whether any adaptive immune responses are required for H polygyrus-mediated protection against RSV infection we used Rag1-deficient mice which lack all T and B cells.

Once again RSV titers were significantly suppressed in both Rag122 mice and wild-type control mice after coinfection with H polygyrus  B.

B and C Ten days after H polygyrus infection half of the large left lung lobe was placed in TRIzol and RT-PCR was performed to measure expression levels of Oas1a Fig 4 B or viperin Fig 4 C in lung comparing H polygyrus-infected mice with naive mice.

Furthermore the upregulation of type I interferon expression seen in the lungs and duodenum of H polygyrus-infected SPF mice was absent in H polygyrus-infected germ-free mice  C and D. These data support a model in which the microbiota plays a critical role in the induction of type I interferons and ISGs during H polygyrus infection which in turn leads to functional antiviral protection in the lung.DISCUSSIONHere we demonstrate that a strictly enteric helminth can have protective effects against RSV infection in the lung through a mechanism mediated by microbiota-dependent type I interferon production.

Germ-free animal experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines and Swiss Federal and Cantonal laws on animal protection.RESULTSH polygyrus protects against RSV-related disease and inflammation and reduces viral loadMice were infected with H polygyrus and 10 days later when adult worms emerge into the lumen of the gut mice were infectedwith RSV.
