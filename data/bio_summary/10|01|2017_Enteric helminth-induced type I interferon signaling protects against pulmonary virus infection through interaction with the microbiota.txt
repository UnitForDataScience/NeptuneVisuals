statistical significance of differences between groups was determined in fig 5 a by using 1-way anova with the tukey post hoc test and in fig 5 b-d by using the unpaired t test.p  .05 and p  .001.role in protection we studied rsv infection in germ-free mice in the presence or absence of h polygyrus infection.in contrast to fully colonized spf mice in germ-free mice rsv titers and rsv l gene expression were not suppressed by h polygyrus coinfection  a and b. furthermore the upregulation of type i interferon expression seen in the lungs and duodenum of h polygyrus-infected spf mice was absent in h polygyrus-infected germ-free mice  c and d. these data support a model in which the microbiota plays a critical role in the induction of type i interferons and isgs during h polygyrus infection which in turn leads to functional antiviral protection in the lung.discussionhere we demonstrate that a strictly enteric helminth can have protective effects against rsv infection in the lung through a mechanism mediated by microbiota-dependent type i interferon production.

in ifnar122 mice the reduction of rsv load in the setting of h polygyrus coinfection was lost implying an essential role for this pathway in h polygyrus-induced protection against rsv infection  a. furthermore the isg induction seen in wild-type mice is also lost in ifnar22 mice after h polygyrus infection  b and c.the cathelicidin-related amp is upregulated during h polygyrus infection but is not required for expression of type i interferon and isgscathelicidins are a family of small cationic peptides with microbicidal and immunomodulatory properties.

once again rsv titers were significantly suppressed in both rag122 mice and wild-type control mice after coinfection with h polygyrus  b. together these observations show that adaptive immune responses and il-4ra-dependent or il-33 receptor-dependent type 2 cytokine responses are not required for the protective effect of h polygyrus on rsv infection.h polygyrus infection induces expression of type i interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in both the duodenum and lungtype i interferons are major players in the initial response to viral entry into the mucosa.because adaptive and innate type 2 immune responses were not essential for protection against rsv infection we hypothesized that h polygyrus enhances the mucosal innate interferon response conferring an antiviral state.

in mice coinfected with h polygyrus rsv-induced increases in nk cell b-cell see  a and b in this article's online repository at  and cd81 t-cell numbers were absent  c and the increase in cdc numbers was significantly reduced  d. early proinflammatory cytokine production of il-6 and tnf-a on day 2 was induced to a significantly lower level in h polygyrus-infected mice compared with those infected with rsv alone see  c and d. ifn-g levels increased with rsv infection but were not significantly suppressed in coinfected mice indicating selective inhibition of a pathway independent of ifn-g see  e.given these changes in rsv-induced signs of disease we investigated whether h polygyrus suppresses the immune response or directly alters the magnitude of rsv infection.

consistent reductions in rsv titers were observed in h polygyrus-coinfected il4ra22 mice similar to those seen in wild-type balbc mice  a. we further assessed innate type 2 immune responses after h polygyrus infection and found a nonsignificant trend for increased il-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells and il-33 levels in the lung tissue compared to rsv- and uv-rsv-infected control mice see  a and b infig 1. h polygyrus infection attenuates rsv disease and inflammation and reduces rsv viral load.

l gene expression was significantly reduced in h polygyrus-infected mice in this strain see  f.these findings demonstrate a potent inhibition of rsv-induced disease early proinflammatory cytokine production and recruitment of a broad range of immune cells to the lung in the setting of h polygyrus coinfection presumably because of an early reduction in viral infection.adaptive immune responses including th2 responses are not required for h polygyrus- induced protection against rsv infectiontype 2 immune responses are crucial during most helminth infections aiding in wound healing and immunity to helminths.il4ra-deficient mice cannot respond to il-4 or il-13 signals and present strongly diminished type 2 immune responses.

the rsv load was similar between il33r22 and wild-type control mice see  c and was reduced to similar levels in both groups by h polygyrus coinfection indicating that there is no essential role for il-33 in protection against rsv infection.to determine whether any adaptive immune responses are required for h polygyrus-mediated protection against rsv infection we used rag1-deficient mice which lack all t and b cells.

b and c ten days after h polygyrus infection half of the large left lung lobe was placed in trizol and rt-pcr was performed to measure expression levels of oas1a fig 4 b or viperin fig 4 c in lung comparing h polygyrus-infected mice with naive mice.

thus h polygyrus-induced type i interferon and isg expression was investigated in cathelicidin-deficient camp22 mice and found to be intact see  d-f. this indicates that although potentially contributing to the innate defense against rsv infection mcramp is not the initiator of and is not required for the protective antiviral immune response induced by h polygyrus infection.h polygyrus adult excretory-secretory products are not responsible for effects on rsv infection whereas larval stages alone confer protectionmuch interest has been building around the prospect of helminth excretory-secretory products as potential therapeutics.

this result combined with the observation that the protective effect of h polygyrus coinfection was lost in ifnar1-deficient mice indicates that upregulation of type i interferon expression by h polygyrus is critical to its antiviral effects.

however ifn-a protein levels were significantly increased in h polyrgyrus coinfected mice at 6 hours after rsv infection  i. these data suggest that pre-existing upregulation of pulmonary type i interferons viperin and oas1a before rsv infection could underpin h polygyrus- induced protection against rsv infection in the lung.h polygyrus-induced protection against rsv infection requires type i interferon receptor signalingbecause isgs including viperin and oas1a are expressed upon type i interferon receptor signaling we used ifnar1-deficient mice which do not signal in response to ifn-a and ifn-b.

importantly h polygyrus infection upregulated expression of type i interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in both the duodenum and lung and its protective effects were lost in both ifnar122 and germ-free mice revealing essential roles for type i interferon signaling and microbiota in h polygyrus-induced protection against rsv.conclusion these data demonstrate that a strictly enteric helminth infection can have remote protective antiviral effects in the lung through induction of a microbiota-dependent type i interferon response.

two hundred l3 h polygyruslarvae were irradiated at 300 gy and compared with nonirradiated larvae in a standard coinfection protocolor naive control mice after h polygyrus infection alone b-d. fig 5 a lungs were harvested on day 4 of rsv infection and plaque assays were performed.

finally enteric helminth infection upregulated antiviral type iinterferon isg and camp gene expression in both the duodenum and lung and the protective effects of h polygyrus on rsv infection were dependent on type i interferon receptor signaling and the presence of microbiota as demonstrated in ifnar122 and germ-free mice which were not protected against rsv infection by h polygyrus.the role of helminths in coinfections is not well understood.

at indicated time points after h polygyrus infection half of the large left lung lobe was placed in trizol and rt-pcr was performed for expression levels of ifnb fig 3 a oas1a fig 3 b or viperin fig 3 c in lung tissue comparing h polygyrus-infected with naive mice.
