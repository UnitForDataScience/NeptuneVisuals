A Predatory mite N. cucumeris from mass-production population B predatorymite from a laboratory population with disease symptoms C the prey mite T. putrescentiae population from laboratory culture without the presence of predatory mite Tyro pure D prey mite from culture with the presence of predatory mite in mass rearing.From the 75 OTUs analyzed by METASTATS 10 OTUs had higher relative abundance in predatory mites compared with prey mites Table .

The list of OTUs in the samples of predatory Neoseiulus cucumeris and prey Tyrophagus putrescentiae mites and the results of Random Forest and METASTATS analyses describing the means of relative abundance of OTUs  for the samples of predatory and prey mites.

The microbiota of the prey mite T. putrescentiae and the predatory mite N. cucumeris consisted of core bacterial taxa present in all prey and predatory mite populations.This core microbiota comprised Wolbachia Cardinium Bartonella-like Blattabacterium-like Solitalea-like Brevibacterium Staphylococcus spp.

No known acaropathogenic bacte- ria were identified in the prey or predatory mites either from the mass rearing or the laboratory population with disease symptoms Table S1.Bacterial microbiota comparisons N. cucumeris predator vs. T. putrescentiae factitious prey.

It is important to highlight that the analyses of differences in the bacterial composition PCoA and population level analyses showed that the differences between predatory and prey mites were lower than among the two prey mite populations examined.

OPENReceived 4 September 2016Accepted 19 December 2016 Published xx xx xxxxComparison of bacterial microbiota of the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris Acari Phytoseiidae and its factitious prey Tyrophagus putrescentiae Acari AcaridaeApostolos Pekas1 Eric Palevsky2 Jason C. Sumner3 M. Alejandra Perotti4 Marta Nesvorna5  Jan Hubert 5Neoseiulus cucumeris is a predatory mite used for biological control of arthropod pests.

The following taxa were associated with predatory mites Cardinium OTU12 Bacillus OTU21 and Staphylococcus OTUs2 7 19 and 23.Venn diagrams show that 11 OTUs were shared by prey mites and 16 OTUs by predatory mites.

The observed microbiota of the predatory mite N. cucumeris and the prey mite T. putrescentiae consisted of intracellular symbionts as well as gutenviron- mental bacteria as it is reported for other species of predatory or saprophagous mites.

Similarly previous studies comparing the bacterial microbiota of M. occidentalis and its spider mite prey Tetranychus urticae Koch Acari Tetranychidae provided evidence for a shared microbiota between the predator and the prey.

This is supported by differences between predator and prey in relative numbers of Blattabacterium-like and Solitalea-like symbiotic bacteria with a higher relative abundance in prey mites.
