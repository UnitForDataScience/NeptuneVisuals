The mean daily volume of water that the rats in the control group drank was 34.6 - 0.8 mLday P  0.001 with respect to the probiotic group and P  0.001 with respect to the water group.The weight of chow that was eaten by the rats during the study was 21.3 - 0.9 gday in the probiotic group25.9 - 1.2 gday in the water group P  0.01 with respect to probiotic group and 29.5 - 1.3 gday in the control group P  0.001 with respect to probiotic group P  0.08 with respect to water group.

Control rats control group n  10 rats treated with CCl4 and water water group n  19 and rats treated with CCl4 and fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei CNCM I-1518 probiotic group n  20.

When considering only the rats that reached laparotomy the time elapsed was 6.3 - 0.7 and 6.1 - 0.8 weeks respectively P  1.During the study the total dose of CCl4 received per rat was similar in the probiotic group and in the watergroup 2873.0 - 357.2 vs 2986.3 - 447.4 mL P  0.94.The mean daily volume of water with probiotic treatment that the rats in the probiotic group drank was57.8 - 3.3 mLday.

As the rats in the probiotic group received a supplementary 20.5 - 1.2 kcalday with the fermented milk diluted in water the total kcals received by the rats did not differ between the three groups 82.4 - 3.3 in the probiotic group 75.1 - 3.6 in the water group and 85.5 - 3.9 in the control group P NS.

Firmicutes was shown to be significantly different between the water group compared to the control and the probiotic groups P  0.01 FDR  0.07.However we did not observe differences between the probiotic group and the water group in any of the microbi- ological determinations.However the microbiome evaluation of ileal content by 16S rRNA analysis showed at the phylum level that the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower in the water group than in the control and probiotic groups P  0.01 FDR  0.07 3.

We analyzed the microbiome of ileal content from 33 rats 23 cirrhotic rats n 13 treated with the probiotic and n 10 treated with water and 10 control rats.

Control rats control group n  10 rats treated with CCl4 and water water group n  19 and rats treated with CCl4 and fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei ssp.

Control rats control group n  10 rats treated with CCl4 and water water group n  19 and rats treated with CCl4 and fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei ssp.

Control rats control group n  10 rats treated with CCl4 and water water group n  19 and rats treated with CCl4 and fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei ssp.
