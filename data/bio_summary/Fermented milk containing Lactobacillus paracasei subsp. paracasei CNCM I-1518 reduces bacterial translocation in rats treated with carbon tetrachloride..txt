forty-four rats were treated with ccl4 and 5 died before week 6. at week 6 of treatment with ccl4 the remaining thirty-nine rats were randomized into the probiotic group n  20 or the water group n  19. the remaining 10 rats made up the control group.the time elapsed between randomization and the study end death or laparotomy performed 1 week afterrats developed ascites was similar in the probiotic group and in the water group 5.1 - 0.6 vs 5.8 - 0.8 weeks p  0.60. when considering only the rats that reached laparotomy the time elapsed was 6.3 - 0.7 and 6.1 - 0.8 weeks respectively p  1.during the study the total dose of ccl4 received per rat was similar in the probiotic group and in the watergroup 2873.0 - 357.2 vs 2986.3 - 447.4 ml p  0.94.the mean daily volume of water with probiotic treatment that the rats in the probiotic group drank was57.8 - 3.3 mlday.

the mean daily volume of water that the rats in the control group drank was 34.6 - 0.8 mlday p  0.001 with respect to the probiotic group and p  0.001 with respect to the water group.the weight of chow that was eaten by the rats during the study was 21.3 - 0.9 gday in the probiotic group25.9 - 1.2 gday in the water group p  0.01 with respect to probiotic group and 29.5 - 1.3 gday in the control group p  0.001 with respect to probiotic group p  0.08 with respect to water group.

firmicutes was shown to be significantly different between the water group compared to the control and the probiotic groups p  0.01 fdr  0.07.however we did not observe differences between the probiotic group and the water group in any of the microbi- ological determinations.however the microbiome evaluation of ileal content by 16s rrna analysis showed at the phylum level that the relative abundance of firmicutes was significantly lower in the water group than in the control and probiotic groups p  0.01 fdr  0.07 3. moreover there was a non-significant trend to a higher abundance of proteobacteria in the control and the probiotic groups than in the water group.probiotic treatment reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf-a in mesenteric lymph nodes but did not change serum cytokines.

the number of rats that developed ascites demonstrated by paracentesis was 80 1620 in the probiotic group and 79 1519 in the water group p  0.9. the cumulative probability of developing ascites at week 18 was 88 in the probiotic group and 86 in the water group p  0.52.probiotic treatment reduced bacterial translocation.

shows the incidence of bacterial trans- location was significantly lower in the probiotic group 7.7 113 than in the water group 54 713 p  0.03. the incidence of bacterial translocation was higher in the water group than in control rats 0 010 p  0.007. shows the bacteria and the sites where bacteria were isolated.

as the rats in the probiotic group received a supplementary 20.5 - 1.2 kcalday with the fermented milk diluted in water the total kcals received by the rats did not differ between the three groups 82.4 - 3.3 in the probiotic group 75.1 - 3.6 in the water group and 85.5 - 3.9 in the control group p ns.

body weight at lap- arotomy was higher in the control group 484.2 - 20.6 g than in the two groups of ccl4 treated rats p  0.001 but it was similar in the probiotic group 353.3 - 30.9 g and in the water group 388.1 - 11.5 g p  0.39. the spleenbody weight ratio was lower in control rats 0.0026 - 0.0001 than in the two groups of rats with cirrhosis p  0.001 and it was similar in the probiotic group 0.0059 - 0.0006 and in the water group 0.0066 - 0.0003 p  0.45.probiotic treatment increased b-defensin-1 and decreased malondialdehyde mda in ileal samples.

all the rats from the three groups were allowed free access to rat chow and water with or without the probiotic probiotic group and water and control groups respectively.

as cirrhotic rats from the water group presented a decrease in firmicutes and a trend to an increase in proteobacteria with respect to control healthyrats our findings suggest that the reduction in bacterial translocation that we observed in the probiotic group is partially due to an improvement in the gut dysbiosis.dysfunction of the intestinal barrier is considered a relevant mechanism to explain pathological bacterial translocation.

the weight of the rats at laparotomy was also similar in the two groups treated with ccl4 353.3 - 30.9 g in the probiotic group and 388.1 - 11.5 g in the water group p  0.39.the estimated mean daily dose of bacteria received by rats in the probiotic group was 2.9 - 0.1 x 109 colony forming units cfu.probiotic treatment did not reduce mortality or ascites formation.

the mortality rate during the study was 35 720 in the probiotic group 31 619 in the water group p  0.8 with respect to probiotic group and 0 010 in the control group p  0.06 with respect to the other two groups.
