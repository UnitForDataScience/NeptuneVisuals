As shown in Figure 1 C. parvum infection with protein deficiency further increases myeloperoxidase and significantly increased Lcn2 compared with protein deficiency alone.Urinary Metabolic Alterations Induced by C. parvum InfectionThe urinary metabolic profiles of control and infected mice were compared at 6 7 and 13 days postinfection using an orthog- onal partial least squares-discriminant analysis OPLS-DA approach to assess the biochemical response to C. parvum exposure.

Consistent with our observations the study of murine C. parvum infection by Ras et al.

The inconsistencies in specific taxonomic shifts across these experiments imply that C. parvum infection does not induce a specific alteration of the microbiota or that the effect cannot be identified using taxonomic analyses.A previous murine study found that cryptosporidiosis induced by C. parvum was enhanced in germ-free immuno- deficient mice relative to immunodeficient mice harboring the altered Schaedler flora a model microbiota composed of 8 bacterial species 32.

PC was identi- fied as the predominant lipid in C. parvum-infected bovine kidney cells and interestingly C. parvum has been suggested to be capable of sequestering phospholipids from the host to incorporate them into the membranes 40.

Unlike nourished equivalents protein-malnourished mice were unable to rapidly clear Cryptosporidium and continue to have detectable organisms in the stool for more than 7 days 17 18.A previous study found strong effects of C. parvum on the murine microbiota although the authors acknowledge that small treatment group size across multiple experiments may have amplified differences between uninfected and infected groups 19.

Following 7 days of C. parvum infection OPLS-DA model Q2Y  0.66 P  .025 the excretion of choline phosphocholine and the gut microbial metabolites of choline dimethylamine DMA and trimethylamine TMA as well as the host oxida- tion product of TMA trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO wereRD Systems according to manufacturer's instructions.

In addition following 6 days of C. parvum infection OPLS-DA model Q2Y  0.82 P  .001 several TCA cycle metabolites succinate citrate isocitrate malate 2-oxoglutarate and fumarate were increased in urine compared with uninfected controls.

Considering all SVs that met filtering criteria see Methods b-diversity calcu- lations and nonmetric multidimensional scaling led to delinea- tion of infected and uninfected samples Figure 4.Microbial-Metabolic Interactions in Response to Malnutrition Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis HCA of the metabolites identified to contribute to the C. parvum infection at days 6 7 and 13 is shown in Figure 5 upper-right quadrant.8070uninfected infected60506713Days post-infectionFigure 3.

Studies using mouse models with varying degrees of colonization resistance coupled with metagenomic andor metatranscriptomic analyses are required to further character- ize interactions between C. parvum and the microbiota.At 6 days postinfection we observed an increase in the uri- nary excretion of TCA cycle intermediates with the exception of cis-aconitate.

Stool supernatant was assayed for total protein BCA Lcn2 RD Systems and MPOmaintained on a protein-deficient diet infected with C. parvum 15 17 18 24.
