of note com- pared with nacs the mean 16s copiesng dna were significantly higher in both mah p  0.01 and sah p  0.001. these data demonstrate an increased circulating bacterial burden in subjects with mah and sah.impact of alcohol consumption and presence of ah on bacterial diversity and distribution ofmicrobiota in circulationa detailed illustration of the relative abundance of bacteria at a phylum level for individual groups is shown in fig.

compared with nacs the relative abundance of phylum bacteroidetes was significantly decreased in hdcs mah and sah p  0.001. in contrast all alcohol-consuming groups had enrichment with fusobacteria this was greatest for hdcs and decreased progressively in mah and sah.

specific enrichment for individual alcohol groups compared with nacs included streptomycetaceae hdcs carnobacteriaceae and clostridiales incertae sedis xi mah and coryne- bacteriaceae dermabacteraceae and micromonosporaceae sah.within the actinobacteria phylum nocardioides was uniformly enriched in the nacs compared with all other alcohol groups fig.

specifically enriched genus for different alcohol groups versus nac group included kocuria and streptomyces for hdcs actino- myces for mah and corynebacterium and brachybac- terium for sah.within the phylum bacteroidetes the nac group was uniformly enriched in genus prevotella and flavo- bacterium when compared with all other alcohol groups fig.

changes in the blood microbiota and gut-microbiome-based metagenomics signature have recently been linked to liver fibrosis in obese patients and patients with non- alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld.2021as a first step in elucidating the potential role of the circulating microbiome in ah we measured the circu- lating microbiome in subjects with moderate ah mah or severe ah sah and compared it with control subjects who consumed large amounts of alco- hol but did not have clinical evidence of liver disease and another group of control subjects without liver dis- ease who did not consume alcohol.

in the nac group lachnospiraceae was enriched in males whereas in the alcohol group hdcs mah and sah females were enriched in genus actinomyces of phylum actinobacteria and order sphingomonadales and family sphingomona- daceae belonging to the phylum proteobacteria .alcohol consumption and presence of ah affect bacterial composition within specific phylathe complex overlay of the differences in distribu- tion of the microbiome across the study groups were next visualized using venn diagrams fig.

qualitative and quantitative assessment of changes in the circulating microbiome were performed by sequencing bacterial dna in subjects with mod- erate ah mah n 5 18 or severe ah sah n 5 19. these data were compared with heavy drinking controls hdcs without obvious liver disease n 5 19 and non-alcohol-consuming controls nacs n 5 20. the data were related to endotoxin levels and markers of monocyte activation.
