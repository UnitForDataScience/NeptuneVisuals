Specific enrichment for individual alcohol groups compared with NACs included Streptomycetaceae HDCs Carnobacteriaceae and Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI MAH and Coryne- bacteriaceae Dermabacteraceae and Micromonosporaceae SAH.Within the Actinobacteria phylum Nocardioides was uniformly enriched in the NACs compared with all other alcohol groups Fig.

Specifically enriched genus for different alcohol groups versus NAC group included Kocuria and Streptomyces for HDCs Actino- myces for MAH and Corynebacterium and Brachybac- terium for SAH.Within the phylum Bacteroidetes the NAC group was uniformly enriched in genus Prevotella and Flavo- bacterium when compared with all other alcohol groups Fig.

However neither LBP nor LPS were signifi- cantly correlated with either with disease severity scores MELD CTP and DF or stage of disease HDCs MAH and SAH suggesting that heavy alcohol use with and without AH potentially produced comparable endotoxemia.The sCD14 levels were inversely correlated with MELD score q 5 20.73 in MAH P 5 0.0005 q 5in SAH P 5 0.04 and DF q 5 20.76 in MAH P 5 0.003.

Changes in the blood microbiota and gut-microbiome-based metagenomics signature have recently been linked to liver fibrosis in obese patients and patients with non- alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD.2021As a first step in elucidating the potential role of the circulating microbiome in AH we measured the circu- lating microbiome in subjects with moderate AH MAH or severe AH SAH and compared it with control subjects who consumed large amounts of alco- hol but did not have clinical evidence of liver disease and another group of control subjects without liver dis- ease who did not consume alcohol.

Furthermore subjects with alcohol use and no antibiotic exposure both HDCsand AH as well as all alcohol groups combined were compared with the NAC group.

Although much is now known about the mechanisms of disease development in AH1112 there are still gaps in knowledge particularly related to why only some individuals at risk develop AH and what determines the severity of the disease.Recently the role of the microbiome has gained attention as a contributor to the development of alcohol associated liver disease.13 Advances in molecular tech- nology have identified the presence of microbiota in the circulation of healthy humans by sequencing 16S ribo- somal DNA rDNA bacterial genes.14 Although many changes in the intestinal microbiome in those who consume large amounts of alcohol as well as those with alcohol-induced liver disease including changes in intes- tinal fungi have been described along with increased intestinal permeability endotoxemia and activation of systemic inflammatory responses15-19 there are no data on the circulating microbiome in patients with AH.

Continued                                                                        groups was specifically enriched in a particular genus Chryseobacterium HDCs Cloacibacterium MAH and Gillisia SAH.For the phylum Firmicutes subjects within the NAC group were enriched in Clostridium sensustricto compared with all alcohol consuming groups.

In the NAC group Lachnospiraceae was enriched in males whereas in the alcohol group HDCs MAH and SAH females were enriched in genus Actinomyces of phylum Actinobacteria and order Sphingomonadales and family Sphingomona- daceae belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria .ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND PRESENCE OF AH AFFECT BACTERIAL COMPOSITION WITHIN SPECIFIC PHYLAThe complex overlay of the differences in distribu- tion of the microbiome across the study groups were next visualized using Venn diagrams Fig.

How- ever no significant differences were seen in plasma LBP levels lgmL among the alcohol consuming groups regardless of the presence and severity of AH HDCs 12.2 6 6.8 versus MAH 11.3 6 5.5 versus SAH 11.5 6 9.1.

Certain families were enriched in more than one alcohol group Peptostreptococcaceae HDCs MAH and SAH Leptotrichiaceae HDCs and SAH Bradyrhizobiaceae HDCs MAH and SAH and Neisseriaceae HDCs and SAH.
