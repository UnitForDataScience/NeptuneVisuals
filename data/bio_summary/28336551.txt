The results presented in February at the ASCO-SITC Clinical Immuno-Oncol- ogy Symposium in Orlando FL reveal that microbial diversity and compo- sition may help predict whether PD-1 inhibitors will shrink melanomas.Animal studies have demonstrated that the presence of certain intestinal bacteria boost the potency of checkpoint inhibitors.

-Janet Colwell ngut Microbes May Up PD-1 Inhibitor ResponseA recent study shows for the first time that patients' gut microbiome may affect whether they respond to checkpoint inhibitors J Clin Oncol 35 2017 suppl 7S abstract 2.

The researchers checked for differences between responders and nonresponders in the 112 patients who received a PD-1 inhibitor--either nivolumab Opdivo Bristol-Myers Squibb or pembroli- zumab Keytruda Merck.The oral microbiome didn't differ between responders and nonrespond- ers but the gut microbiome did the researchers reported.

What we need to know is 'what is the role of the microbes at the species level and which of their activities are implicated in the beneficial effect' he says.Wargo and Gopalakrishnan now plan to test whether modifying gut bacteria improves the response to checkpoint inhibitors.

However researchers haven't established whether gut bacteria provide the same benefits in humans.To test this possibility a team led by Jennifer Wargo MD and graduate stu- dent Vancheswaran Gopalakrishnan of The University of Texas MD AndersonCancer Center in Houston sampled bacteria from more than 200 patients with metastatic melanoma who were about to undergo treatment.

He adds that the number of patients in the study which is large for microbi- ome research gives him confidence that this effect is real.The Clostridiales contains a variety of microorganisms some that are beneficial and some such as Clostridium difficile that are pathogenic and researchers now need to narrow down which species are responsible for the effects says Christian Jobin PhD of the University of Florida Gainesville who also wasn't connected to the study.

One 2015 study for instance determined that a CTLA-4-blocking antibody was more effective against melanoma in mice whose intestinal microbiome included certain species of Bacteroides Science 20153501079-84.

Overall respond- ers had more diverse gut bacteria with higher abundance of microbes in the Clostridiales group and lower abundance of species in the Bacteriodales group.

The scientists also detected a cor- relation between the composition of the gut microbiome and the number of cancer-killing CD8 T cells that infil- trated patients' tumors.

There seems to be a clear role for the microbiome in modulating host and antitumor immunity as well as responses to immunotherapy says Wargo.This is very important work says Jeffrey Weber MD PhD of the New York University Langone Medical Center who wasn't connected to the study.
