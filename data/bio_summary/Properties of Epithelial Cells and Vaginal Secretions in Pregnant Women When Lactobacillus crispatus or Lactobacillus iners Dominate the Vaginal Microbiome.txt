Conclusion Epithelial cells exhibit a higher level of autophagy lower induction of stress-related hsp70 and release lower level of mediators when L crispatus is most abundant as compared to when L iners dominates the vaginal microbiota.Keywordsautophagy heat shock protein Lactobacillus crispatus Lactobacillus iners vaginal epithelial cellsIntroductionThe most numerically dominant bacteria in the vaginal micro- biome in the majority of healthy reproductive-age women are Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners.1-3 In the majority of women only 1 of these lactobacilli is typically present although transitions from L crispatus to L iners dom- inance and vice versa are not uncommon.4 A recent investi- gation has suggested that a likely explanation for this interconversion is conditional differentiation a mechanism whereby the nutritional characteristics of the vagina alternate between 2 states each favoring the proliferation of 1 of these lactobacilli species.5 The genomes of L crispatus and L iners and their biosynthesis capabilities are markedly different.5 The L crispatus genome is almost twice as large as that of L iners and has a corresponding wider range of metabolic capabilities.

In marked contrast L iners is found in both healthy women and in women with vaginal disturbances and has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.8-11 L crispatus abundance has been postulated to restrict the growth of other bacteria that are associated with vaginal dysbiosis and thereby reduce suscept- ibility to adverse sequelae.12 Conversely L iners may not interfere with proliferation of other potentially harmful bac- teria but is able to persist in their presence.13 The ability of L iners to adapt to changing conditions despite its small genome may be related to its capacity for differential gene activation when the organism is present in healthy asymptomatic women when compared to its occurrence in women with bacterial4910any purpose in the prior 4 weeks had a multifetal pregnancy or exhibited any degree of vaginal bleeding.

Conversely L iners is more dependent than L crispatus onexogenous sources of amino acids and other cell components for its growth.67A striking difference between L crispatus and L iners is the consistent observation that the numerical dominance of L cris- patus in vaginal communities is highly associated with the1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Weill Cornell Medicine NY USA2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology New York Presbyterian QueensQueens NY USA3 Department of Biological Sciences and the Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies University of Idaho Moscow ID USACorresponding AuthorSteven S.

There were no associations between the relative percentage of L iners in the vaginal microbiome and the epithelial cell p62 and hsp70 levels P  .05.Associations between the concentrations of compounds present in vaginal secretions and L crispatus and L iners abun- dance in the vaginal microbiota are shown in Table 2.

The increased level of D-lactic acid when L crispatus is most abundant is not unexpected since this organism has the gene coding for D-lactate dehydrogenase whereas L iners does not.22 The concentration of almost every other vaginal fluid component investigated was significantly elevated in women when L iners was dominant.We propose a mechanism to explain the elevated concen- tration of compounds in vaginal secretions in response to rec- ognition by epithelial cells of an altered vaginal milieu.

L. iners but not L crispatus has been shown to activate Toll- like receptor TLR signaling in epithelial cells.2324 This leads to activation of a protein called mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR25 the major inhibitor of autophagy.26 In addition to blocking autophagy-directed protein degradation mTOR also enhances the rate of messenger RNA translation into protein.27 The activity of mTOR is upregulated by hsp7017 whose synth- esis is also induced by TLR activation.28 Thus as has been suggested previously18 elevations in the intracellular level of hsp70 trigger the initiation of an increased rate of protein synthesis.The expanded release of mediators into the vaginal lumen in the presence of L iners dominance may serve a protective func- tion.

crispatus was dominant in 69 43.9 women while L iners dominated in 23 14.6 women.
