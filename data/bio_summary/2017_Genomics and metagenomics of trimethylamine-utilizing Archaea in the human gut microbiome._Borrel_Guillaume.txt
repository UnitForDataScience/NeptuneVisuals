in addition to pathway redundancy a higher tma production capacity of the microbiota would thus help the methanomassi- liicoccales to develop in the human gut.the predicted ability of human-associated metha- nomassiliicoccales to deplete tma in the gut was supported by comparison of experimentally deter- mined fecal tma concentrations in subjects harbor- ing 'mttb methanomassiliicoccales' 'mttb lacking methanomassiliicoccales' and subjects not carrying methanomassiliicoccales fi 3d.

however the functional diversity of human- associated methanomassiliicoccales is still poorly understood and many aspects need further explora- tion in order to clarify their role in tma bioremedia- tion naturally occurring or deliberately instigated and other yet undefined connections with human health.in the present study we identified the predomi- nant methanomassiliicoccales representatives asso- ciated with the human gut microbiome based on a meta-analysis of published data sets and novel data from the eldermet cohort of older subjects 464 years of age in ireland the capacity of predo- minant methanomassiliicoccales species to utilize tma was then assessed by analyzing six genomes assembled de novo from eldermet metagenomics data and by the biochemical characterization of 'ca.

the capacity to deplete tma is thus potentially not shared by all the methanomassiliicoccales that are commonly present in the human microbiota.intestinal methanomassiliicoccales prevalence abundance correlated with microbiota potential for modulating tmawe hypothesized that the occurrence of methanomassiliicoccales representatives with pre- dicted ability to utilize tma for growth 'mttb methanomassiliicoccales' would be influenced by the tma production potential of the gut microbiota.

in addition to increased microbiota tma production capacity in long-term residential care subjects abundance of tma-utilizing methanomassiliicoccales correlated positively with bacterial gene count for tma production and negatively with fecal tma concentrations.

indeed 'mttb methanomassiliicoccales' were detected in 6 of the eldermet subjects with no tma production pathway detected in their gut microbiota and this proportion progressively increased to 36 among the subjects carrying a microbiota able to produce tma from four different precursors 3c.

despite multiple attempts to isolate members of the 'host-associated clade' including those from the human gut no pure culture of these archaea has been obtained to date from this observation it has been previously suggested that members of this clade could be dependent on unrecognized metabolites produced by co-occurring bacteria this aspect will need to be further studied to determine whether members of the 'host-associated clade' present in the human gut could be dependent on some specific bacteria for such metabolites and whether those bacteria make part of the diversity- associated module that tend to be lost among residential care subjects as previously mentioned specialization to the gut microbiome could have occurred several times during the evolution of the methanomassiliicoccales 1 in an evolutionary context it is interesting to observe that the metha- nomassiliicoccales representatives that potentially co-evolved with the host for a longer evolutionary period those of the 'host-associated clade' were preferentially found in community-dwelling subjects having a health-associated microbiota while 'ca.mmc.

luminyensis in the human body tma is produced exclusively by the activity of gut bacteria after diffusion into the blood tma is oxidized by the liver enzyme fmo3 monooxygenase into trimethylamine-n-oxide tmao a molecule increasingly recognized as an important factor for the development of cardiovas- cular disease and chronic kidney diseases .

alvus' respectively in order to determine the prevalence and abundance of methanomassiliicoccales representatives in the human microbiome we made a census of methano- massiliicoccales sequences present in 10 studies on the human gut microbiota extending these data sets with 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from 190 previously unpublished shotgun metagenome data sets from the eldermet cohort.a total of nine methanomassiliicoccales otus 97 identity cutoff were identified across this combined survey of the human gut microbiome and these likely represent distinct species.

however the genes encoding these pathways could be variably present between strains of the same species or genera as recently exemplified for choline conversion to tma  for this reason we did not assess tma production potential on the basis of 16s rrna gene composition but based on functional markers responsible for the final step of tma production within the four pathways 3a.

potentially converting choline and betaine to tma are phylogenetically diverse and partially comprise uncharacterized species or not yet sequenced but collectively could represent important agents of tma production in the human gut supplementary table s4.

more diversified tma production pathways in a single subject could allow the conversion of a larger number of different food ingredients into tma.figure 3 microbial metabolisms modulating tma concentrations in the human gut microbiome.

in the current study while the presence of 'mttb methanomassiliicoc- cales' was associated with lower fecal tma concen- trations an increased number of different tma production pathways was not significantly asso- ciated with higher fecal tma concentrations.

evaluation of the immunogenic potential of the dominant human gut methanomas- siliicoccales and more particularly those with a predicted ability to utilize tma is needed to determine whether their role could be mostly positive through tma removal or if a more nuanced role is being played.
