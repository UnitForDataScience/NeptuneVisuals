Despite multiple attempts to isolate members of the 'Host-associated clade' including those from the human gut no pure culture of these Archaea has been obtained to date From this observation it has been previously suggested that members of this clade could be dependent on unrecognized metabolites produced by co-occurring bacteria This aspect will need to be further studied to determine whether members of the 'Host-associated clade' present in the human gut could be dependent on some specific bacteria for such metabolites and whether those bacteria make part of the Diversity- Associated module that tend to be lost among residential care subjects As previously mentioned specialization to the gut microbiome could have occurred several times during the evolution of the Methanomassiliicoccales 1 In an evolutionary context it is interesting to observe that the Metha- nomassiliicoccales representatives that potentially co-evolved with the host for a longer evolutionary period those of the 'Host-associated clade' were preferentially found in community-dwelling subjects having a health-associated microbiota while 'Ca.Mmc.

In addition to pathway redundancy a higher TMA production capacity of the microbiota would thus help the Methanomassi- liicoccales to develop in the human gut.The predicted ability of human-associated Metha- nomassiliicoccales to deplete TMA in the gut was supported by comparison of experimentally deter- mined fecal TMA concentrations in subjects harbor- ing 'mttB Methanomassiliicoccales' 'mttB lacking Methanomassiliicoccales' and subjects not carrying Methanomassiliicoccales Fi 3d.

However the functional diversity of human- associated Methanomassiliicoccales is still poorly understood and many aspects need further explora- tion in order to clarify their role in TMA bioremedia- tion naturally occurring or deliberately instigated and other yet undefined connections with human health.In the present study we identified the predomi- nant Methanomassiliicoccales representatives asso- ciated with the human gut microbiome based on a meta-analysis of published data sets and novel data from the ELDERMET cohort of older subjects 464 years of age in Ireland The capacity of predo- minant Methanomassiliicoccales species to utilize TMA was then assessed by analyzing six genomes assembled de novo from ELDERMET metagenomics data and by the biochemical characterization of 'Ca.

Beyond the interesting potential for the removal of deleterious methylated compounds by Methanomassiliicoccales in the human gut it is important to better understand the general biology and ecology of these methanogens in the human gut and their overall interaction with the bacterial microbiome.Representatives of the two main Methanomassiliicoccales clades have different interactions with the gut microbiome and clinical metadataSubjects of the ELDERMET cohort are living in the community or in residential care either long term orrehabilitation.

alvus' respectively In order to determine the prevalence and abundance of Methanomassiliicoccales representatives in the human microbiome we made a census of Methano- massiliicoccales sequences present in 10 studies on the human gut microbiota extending these data sets with 16S rRNA gene sequences extracted from 190 previously unpublished shotgun metagenome data sets from the ELDERMET cohort.A total of nine Methanomassiliicoccales OTUs 97 identity cutoff were identified across this combined survey of the human gut microbiome and these likely represent distinct species.

The capacity to deplete TMA is thus potentially not shared by all the Methanomassiliicoccales that are commonly present in the human microbiota.Intestinal Methanomassiliicoccales prevalence abundance correlated with microbiota potential for modulating TMAWe hypothesized that the occurrence of Methanomassiliicoccales representatives with pre- dicted ability to utilize TMA for growth 'mttB Methanomassiliicoccales' would be influenced by the TMA production potential of the gut microbiota.

Indeed 'mttB Methanomassiliicoccales' were detected in 6 of the ELDERMET subjects with no TMA production pathway detected in their gut microbiota and this proportion progressively increased to 36 among the subjects carrying a microbiota able to produce TMA from four different precursors 3c.

We next investigated them to predict their TMA-utilizing capacity and the gut adaptations of these Archaea.Variation in TMA utilization potential in human gut MethanomassiliicoccalesThe five Methanomassiliicoccales representatives with an estimated complete genome are very likely to be methanogens as they harbored genes coding for the methyl coenzyme M reductase complex as well as the 17 other marker genes that are universal and unique to methanogens Supplementary Table S3.
