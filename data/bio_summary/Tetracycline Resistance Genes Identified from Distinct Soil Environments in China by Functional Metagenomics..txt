The mean MIC values of the Yunnan and Tibet clones 58 and 65 mgml respectively were much higher than that of the Sichuan clones 32 mgml.Identification of Tetracycline Resistance Genes and Phylogenetic AnalysisThe genes responsible for tetracycline resistance were identified by sequencing and BLAST analyzing the resistant subclones and 24 unique resistance genes of different types were obtained .

We found efflux transporter genes form all the libraries including21 major facilitator superfamily efflux pump genes and one multidrug and toxic compound extrusion MATE transporter gene.

Besides numerous resistance genes have been detected in different kinds of food     and the diet is one of the main route for the entrance of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria within the humans   .

Due to the horizontal exchange of genes on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and transposons numerous tetracycline efflux and ribosomal protection genes spread rapidly in a variety of species and ecosystems over time      .

Nevertheless further work is needed to figure out how pH condition affects the stability of the degradation product of our enzyme as well as to gain clear understanding of the degradation mechanism.Functional metagenomic approach is able to reveal novel resistance genes that are unrecognizable as resistance genes on the basis of sequence from the vast environmental resistome    .

Efflux pump genes were found to be predominant distributed across soil types and habitats while two enzymatic inactivation genes were also identified.

The exploration of diverse resistance genes in environmental organisms and its mobilization to clinic would aid in our understanding of the evolution of the resistome as well as anticipation of the emergence of new resistance mechanisms in clinic.MATERIALS AND METHODSMetagenomic Library ConstructionThree metagenomic libraries were constructed using soil samples collected from distinct area of China .

The MATE transporter and inactivation enzyme genes were only found from Tibet library.

81406.doi Soil microbiota represents one of the ancient evolutionary origins of antibiotic resistance and has been increasingly recognized as a potentially vast unstudied reservoir of resistance genes with possibilities to exchange with pathogens.

To investigate tetracycline resistance genes from soil bacteria in different habitats we performed functional analysis of three metagenomic libraries derived from soil samples collected from Yunnan Sichuan and Tibet respectively in China.
