Results were compared to earlier available data for GVL from the same participant before the onset of menopause first time point.Results Median age at the first time point was 42 years and 52 years at the second time point.

When considering our study 13 ofLow-level genital HIV shedding after menopause 205ORIGINAL RESEARCHJournal of Virus Eradication 2017 3 204-207the participants had detectable GVL before and after menopause 40 at only one of the two time points and 47 had undetectable GVL.The somewhat 'sporadic' nature of GVL shedding has also been described by others 16.

Inclusion criteria included women in natural menopause second time point with at least one result of GVL available resultstored sample of vaginal secretions from earlier studies first time point.

These women could possibly then be in menopause second time point while being at reproductive age with regular natural menstrual periods during the earlier study first time point.

Suppression of PVL with ART appears to be the main predictor for reduced GVL shedding and thus reduced risk for HIV transmission 1617.Better knowledge on GVL shedding in menopausal women will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection in this target group and of the risks of HIV sexual transmission from menopausal women.

In addition healthy HIV-uninfected menopausal women might have increased CCR5 expression on endocervical CD4 T cells 9 as well as decreased innate anti-HIV-1 activity in the lower genital tract 10 which could facilitate HIV susceptibility.Corresponding author Nadia Kancheva Landolt HIV-NAT Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre 104 Rajdamri Road Pathumwan BangkokThailand 10330 Email 204In spite of these biological changes in women after the menopause the few studies available have failed to find differences in clinical outcomes related to HIV disease progression and infectivity between pre- and postmenopausal women 311-13.

The high prevalence of non-communicable diseases after menopause requires special attention and comprehensive care.Keywords HIV and women menopause genital viral shedding metabolic syndromeIntroductionWomen represent approximately half of all HIV-positive individuals.

There was no significant difference between the two time points P0.687.Intermediate vaginal flora or bacterial vaginosis was found in 73 of participants during the second time point.
