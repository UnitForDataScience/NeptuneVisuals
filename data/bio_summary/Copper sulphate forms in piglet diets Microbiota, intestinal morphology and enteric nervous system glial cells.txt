For intestinal histometry on HE-stained sec- tions the height of intestinal villi V 10 villi measured per section the depth of intestinal cryptsC 10 crypts measured per section and the ratio of villi and crypts values VC ratio were measured and calculated by image analysis software Image pro Plus 6.3 Media Cybernetics Inc. Silver Springs MD USA.HistochemistrySections from duodenum jejunum and ileum were used to determine the mucin profile which was obtained analyzing the histochemical reactivity of the intestinal mucous cells.

The present data show that dietary supplementation with 150UP in the first period post-weaning may assist in restoring the gut morphology improving duodenal structure.Key words copper sulphate intestinal microanatomy microbiota nutrition piglet.INTRODUCTIONReduction in antimicrobial use and prevention of pathologies is a key point to keep good productivity and animal health Seal et al.

No changes in intestinal morphology of weaned piglets with dietary supplementation of 250 ppm of copper sulphate were observed Radecki et al.

CTR no added copper sulphate 150P 150 ppm copper sulphate in protected form 150UP 150 ppm copper sulphate in unprotected form.Table 4 Effect of dietary copper sulphate in protected and unprotected form on microbiological analyses in piglet cecum and colonItemDietary treatmentCTR150P150UPCaecumTotal bacterial count6.710.40A4.700.22B7.000.01AEnterobacteriaceae spp6.560.39a4.430.23b6.300.60aStreptococcus spp6.370.255.720.245.770.73Lactobacillus spp6.540.656.220.606.341.11 ColonTotal bacterial count6.84 - 0.21A5.60 - 0.26B7.00 - 0.01A Enterobacteriaceae spp6.58 - 0.306.22 - 0.476.90 - 0.72 Streptococcus spp6.92 - 0.50A5.79 - 0.23B5.77 - 0.73BLactobacillus spp6.54 - 0.665.70 - 0.716.34 - 0.87Values are means SEM n  6 data are expressed as log10 colony-forming unitsg of digesta.

Moreover dietary CuSO4 supplementa- tion in post-weaning piglets positively modulated intestinal microflora reducing the number of col- iforms in both cecum and colon HoEURjberg et al.

Different sources of dietary copper have been shown to display a different effect on intestinal struc- ture and microflora Armstrong et al.

Quantifications of glial cells were referred to each intestinal section area and extrapo- lated to mm2 to allow comparison of the data thus reflecting glial cell density Di Giancamillo et al.

The observer was not aware of the origin of the sections.Microbiological analysesThe microbiological counts in the large intestinal digesta were determined by the plate-count tech- nique Shen et al.

Moreover intestinal morphological changes during weaning are reputed to cause a reduced absorptive capacity Boudry et al.
