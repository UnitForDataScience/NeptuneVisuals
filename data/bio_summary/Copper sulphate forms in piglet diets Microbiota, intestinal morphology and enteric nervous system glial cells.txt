2004. on these bases the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of dietary supple- mentation in post-weaning piglets with different forms of copper sulphate on small intestinal micro- anatomy and large intestine microbiota.materials and methodsprocedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the european communities council directive 201063eu and approved by the italian ministry of health dl 26 4 march 2014.animals diets and managementninety newly weaned female piglets lan- drace 9 large white 26 days of age weighing8.4 0.2 kg were stratified by weight and randomly assigned to one of the three dietary treatments.

the present data show that dietary supplementation with 150up in the first period post-weaning may assist in restoring the gut morphology improving duodenal structure.key words copper sulphate intestinal microanatomy microbiota nutrition piglet.introductionreduction in antimicrobial use and prevention of pathologies is a key point to keep good productivity and animal health seal et al.

no changes in intestinal morphology of weaned piglets with dietary supplementation of 250 ppm of copper sulphate were observed radecki et al.

fur- ther studies are required to evaluate the influence of dosage and length of copper sulphate dietary supple- mentation on gut oxidative stress markers.acknowledgmentsthe authors are grateful to the manica s.p.a. rover- eto tn italy for funding the study and providing the dietary interventions authors wish to thank also sintal zootecnica isola vicentina vicenza italy for providing microencapsulation of the cuso4.referencesarmstrong ta cook dr ward mm williams cm spears jw.

2007. moreover dietary cuso4 supplementa- tion in post-weaning piglets positively modulated intestinal microflora reducing the number of col- iforms in both cecum and colon hoeurjberg et al.

2005. different sources of dietary copper have been shown to display a different effect on intestinal struc- ture and microflora armstrong et al.

2004. usually copper sulphate dietary supplementa- tion is a common means to improve growth perfor- mances in post-weaning piglets due to its antibacterial activity cromwell 2002. on the otherhand a study reported that ionic copper might work as a pro-oxidant in the organism catalyzing hydro- xyl radicals formation bremner 1998. in fact fry et al.

in weaned piglets copper dietary levels of 5-6 mgkg feed is adequate to meet the nutritional requirements as stated by the national research council nrc 2012. however it is usually used in piglet's diet at higher concentra- tions 100-175 ppm due its growth promoting effects shelton et al.

2011. in fact several studies showed that dietary copper supplementation in weaned piglets can modulate gut health reducing potential pathogens jensen 1998 hoeurjberg et al.
