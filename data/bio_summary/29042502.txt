In a similar trend the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells increased from 1.65 - 1.52 in control mice to 17.9 - 5.4 in colonized mice indicating that the effect of CSCM members was not restricted to germfree mice.

These results indicate that in mice housed under conventional conditions the coloni- zation of the gut with a streptomycin-resistant CSCM strain induces an increase in TUNEL-positive cells and a decrease in proliferative cells in proximal colonic epithelium as observed in germfree associated mice and that the TLR4 pathway is involved in this phenomenon.Impact of CSCM strains on murine proximal colon organoids.

In contrast when streptomycin-treated SPF TLR4-- mice were colonized by gavage with the streptomycin-resistant isolate of A. radioresistens 15 days after colonization the per- centages of proliferative cells were 18.83 - 6.84 in streptomycin-treated TLR4-- mice and 17.03 - 4.25 in streptomycin-treated TLR4-- mice colonized with the A. radiore- sistens streptomycin-resistant strain.

This effect was not observed in germfree mice monoassociated with B. fragilis a commensal Gram- negative bacterium that was not identified by 16S rRNA metataxonomics as a crypt- associated microbe in conventional mice even if in monocolonized mice B. fragilis could colonize the colonic crypts .

As shown in  the set of purified LPSs from CSCM members did not induce a decrease in the number of colonospheres derived from the crypts of RIPK3-- mice in contrast to what was observed in WT mice  indicating that RIPK3 depletion could improve the survival rate in LPS-stimulated colonic crypt cultures .

On the basis of our recent results demonstrating a Nod2-mediated cytoprotective pathway of gut stem cells by bacterial muramyl-dipeptide  we decided to address the possible roles of CSCM members on crypt physiology and to characterize these strains and their possible functional impact.Given the crypt localization of CSCM we hypothesized that cells composing the crypt including Lgr5 stem cells located at the bottom of the crypt cells of the transit-amplifying compartment and upper noncycling and terminally differentiating epithelial cells could be affected by CSCM.

It was shown that in mice deficient for Myd88 the adaptor molecule for Toll-like receptor TLR signaling the proliferative state of the colonic crypt was higher than in wild-type mice  indicating a key role of TLRs through recognition of commensal bacteria in the regulation of intestinal epithelial regeneration and homeostasis.
