A Percentage of EdU cells in proximal colonic PC tissue from mice monocolonized with CSCM members or with B. fragilis on day 15 with a representative EdU staining of proximal colonic tissue from germfree mice as a control Ctrl.

In a similar trend the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells increased from 1.65 - 1.52 in control mice to 17.9 - 5.4 in colonized mice indicating that the effect of CSCM members was not restricted to germfree mice.

These results indicate that in mice housed under conventional conditions the coloni- zation of the gut with a streptomycin-resistant CSCM strain induces an increase in TUNEL-positive cells and a decrease in proliferative cells in proximal colonic epithelium as observed in germfree associated mice and that the TLR4 pathway is involved in this phenomenon.Impact of CSCM strains on murine proximal colon organoids.

In contrast when streptomycin-treated SPF TLR4-- mice were colonized by gavage with the streptomycin-resistant isolate of A. radioresistens 15 days after colonization the per- centages of proliferative cells were 18.83 - 6.84 in streptomycin-treated TLR4-- mice and 17.03 - 4.25 in streptomycin-treated TLR4-- mice colonized with the A. radiore- sistens streptomycin-resistant strain.

This effect was not observed in germfree mice monoassociated with B. fragilis a commensal Gram- negative bacterium that was not identified by 16S rRNA metataxonomics as a crypt- associated microbe in conventional mice even if in monocolonized mice B. fragilis could colonize the colonic crypts .

In order to obtain lipid A the LPSs were hydrolyzed with aqueous 1 acetic acid AcOH for 2 h at 100degC and centrifuged 11000 rpm 4degC 1 h. In order to establish lipid A structure the precipitate thus obtained underwent chemical analyses  and mass spectrometry MS .SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALSupplemental material for this article may be found at .TEXT S1 PDF file 0.2 MB.FIG S1 JPG file 0.2 MB.FIG S2 JPG file 0.1 MB.FIG S3 JPG file 0.3 MB.FIG S4 JPG file 0.2 MB.FIG S5 JPG file 0.2 MB.FIG S6 JPG file 0.1 MB.FIG S7 JPG file 0.1 MB.TABLE S1 DOCX file 0.1 MB.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Emmanuel Frachon from the Recombinant Protein Platform of the Institut Pasteur for growing bacteria in fermentors E.
