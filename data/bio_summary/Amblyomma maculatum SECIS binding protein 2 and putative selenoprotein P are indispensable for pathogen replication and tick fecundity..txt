The expression levels of the target genes in the control samples were set to 1.Impact on selenium concentrationDecreased selenium levels were detected in the SBP2 and SELENOP gene-silenced ticks but the result was only statistically significant for the SELELNOP knockdowns p 0.04 D. The selenium level decreased in the SBP2- and SELENOP-silenced ticks to 0.073 mgg and 0.053 mgg respectively from 0.105 mgg in the dsLacZ ticks D.Impact on tick microbiota colonizationThe abundance of R. parkeri was unchanged in the gut tissues and salivary glands of the SBP2 and SELENOP knockdown ticks A.

The tran- scriptional activities of SELENOP and selenophosphate synthetase SEPHS2 diminished after the blood meal in the slow and fast feeding stages BeC whereas in the midgut tissues SELENOP was up regulated 3-fold in the slow feeding stage but diminished later B. Contrastingly the transcriptional activity of SEPHS2 was up regulated 40 fold in the midgut tissues of the fast feeding stage C. The transcriptional expression of SBP2 SELENOP and SEPHS2 were estimated in the R. parkeri-infected tick tissues to assess the tick response to pathogen infection D. In both tissue types SBP2 expression was upregulated significantly during the R. parkeri infections with a 2-fold increase in the midgut tissues p  0.005 and a 5-fold increase in the salivary glands P  0.005.

The SELENOP SELENOS SELENOK thioredoxin reductase TXNRD2 SELENON SELENOT and MSRB1 SelX tran- script levels were depleted in the ticks when SBP2 was knocked down while SEPHS2 and SELENOO transcripts were significantly upregulated and eEFSec and SELENOM remained unaffected A. Interestingly catalase expression levels remained un- changed despite significant upregulation of superoxide dismutase CuZn-SOD in the SBP2 knockdown tissues A.The SELENOP transcript levels were depleted by 96 and 97 in both tick midgut and salivary glands respectively upon gene silencing B.

A significant increase in SEPHS2 SBP2 and Cu Zn-SOD transcript levels was observed in the SELENOP-silenced midgut tissues B. SELENOO and TXNRD2 were also signifi- cantly upregulated in tick salivary glands B. SELENOS tran- scripts in both tick tissues MRSB1 SelX in midguts and catalase in salivary glands were all significantly depleted following SELENOP knockdown B.Immunodetection of SBP2 and SELENOP in the knockdownsThe SELENOP antibody cross-reacted with a tick protein of z30 KDa in both the non-treated and irrelevant dsRNA-LacZ- treated ticks while no cross reactions occurred with the dsSBP2 or dsSELENOP-treated ticks B.

Transcriptional gene expression for A SBP2 B SELENOP and C SEPHS2 was estimated in unfed ticks slow feeding 4- day ticks and fast feeding 8-day ticks in adult female A. maculatum.

Functional characterization of SBP2 a gene that plays a critical role in selenoprotein synthesis and SELENOP a gene known to play role in selenium transport yielded important information about their effects on tick fecundity pathogen replication trans- ovarial transmission and the overall selenium concentration inside ticks.Computationally we showed the presence of sequence conser- vation in tick SBP2 and SELENOP and their respective homologs in vertebrates and invertebrates using multiple sequence alignments and the phylogenetic relationships among them Figs S1e4.

The reduction of R. parkeri levels in SBP2- and SELENOP- deficient tick salivary glands was likely compensated for by higher level of symbionts such as CMM FLE and others thus resulting in an increased bacterial load in the SBP2- and SELENOP-silenced tick salivary glands .Depletion of SBP2 SELENOP and selenium possibly caused the reduced egg laying we observed in the ticks lower fecundity a result similar to that reported for Drosophila feeding on a selenium- deficient diet .

The SELENOP epitope recognized in ticks further confirmed the presence of this protein in ticks but we cannot rule out the possibility that the ticks may contain an incomplete sequence.

Importantly the selenium level in the immature and mature tick stages increased significantly after a blood meal but the selenium level decreased in ticks after the SBP2 and SELENOP knockdowns.

The maximum selenium concen- tration in ticks reached 0.3 mg per g in the adult female ticks.
