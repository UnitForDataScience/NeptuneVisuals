though the gastrointestinal gi microbiome undoubtedly interacts with the human body there is much that is unknown about the formation mainte- nance and impact that the microbiome has on health and disease.the authors have nothing to disclose.department of family and community medicine university of kansas school of medicine- wichita 1010 north kansas wichita ks 67214 usa corresponding author.e-mail address prim care clin office pract 44 2017 733-7420095-454317a 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.new evidence suggests that the microbiome begins forming during the fetal period either through translocation of bacteria from maternal circulation or colonization via bac- terial ascension from the vagina.the method of delivery and the first few days of life significantly modify the microbiome composition.early diet plays a key role in estab- lishing a colony of good bacteria as human milk oligosaccharides found in breast milk stimulate the growth of key bacteria.

dysbiosis a condition wherein the healthy microbial structure of the gi tract is disturbed has been postulated to be an inciting event or contributing factor to the devel- opment or worsening of metabolic disease mental health neurologic disease and can- cer among other conditions.for instance children who are raised in homes with pets have alterations in their microbiome that may be a link to protection from devel- oping allergic diseases and respiratory virus infections.furthermore studies of individ- uals with atherosclerosis demonstrate that those with and without disease have significantly different bacterial species that predominate in their gi microbiome.the combination of a specific microbiome composition with a diet that provides a specific digestive substrate may result in the synthesis of trimethylamine-n-oxide which has been identified as a risk factor for major cardiovascular events.similarly in 1 study the gut microbiome composition was found to be more predictive of type 2 diabetes dis- ease severity than the body mass index.the microbiome is also different in obese and lean individuals.these observations raise interesting questions for future research.

does the composition of the microbiome drive disease or does the disease state alter the milieu of the environment such that the microbiome composition changes what is the clinical significance of knowing about an alteration can diagnostic strategies or treatment options be developed that allow clinicians to partner with the microbiome to improve disease outcomesalthough metagenomics and emerging techniques targeted at taxonomic identifica- tion of gut bacterial composition have significantly increased knowledge of the gi microbiome little is known about how to apply these observations to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disease.

interestingly randomized trials have demonstrated that the consumption of human milk oligosaccharide analogues even by adults can improve the microbiome by stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria.after establishment the microbiome continues to evolve in composition and func- tion throughout the first few years of life.

during this period enteric neurons immuno- logic factors and the microbiome itself interact through complex signaling pathways to establish a homeostatic environment in the gi tract.by age 3 years the micro- biome takes on a composition with characteristics that remain generally consistent through much of adulthood.however many events can shift microbiome composi- tion and function in ways that may ultimately affect health.

attempts to change an individual's gut microbiome go back as far as the fourth century when the first fecal transplant was recorded for the treatment of severe diarrhea.fecal microbiota transplantation fmt has been shown to significantly alter the composition of the recipient's gut microbiome.

emerging topics in gastroenterologygretchen irwin md mba laura mayans md mph rick kellerman mdgastrointestinal microbiome and probioticsresearchers estimate that more than 100 trillion bacteria representing more than 600 different phylotypes can be found within a healthy human gut.additionally more than 30 different fungal species may also be found in humans depending on gender and stage of life.these bacteria and fungi make up a community of microorganisms that lives in symbiosis with humans engaging in numerous diverse interactions that influence health.

changing substrates may create new patterns of bacterial growth and changes in the diversity of the microbiome.genetic varia- tions diet stress and medication use have all been demonstrated to affect the composition of the microbiota in the gi tract.aging may lead to changes in physi- ology that affect gi bacteria potentially resulting in somatic symptoms related to a disordered microbiome.research is now focusing on the impact that an altered microbiome has on an indi- vidual's health and symptomatology.

when the composition of the microbiome shifts individuals may begin to experience specific pathologic symptoms.

for example in patients with irritable bowel syndrome studies suggest that alterations in bacterial composition are associated with changes in epithelial barrier dysfunction visceral hy- persensitivity and gi motility.however gi symptoms such as diarrhea constipation bloating and abdominal pain are no longer thought to be the only manifestations of a disordered microbiome.

many associations are postulated but few evidence-based recommendations can be made.nonetheless probiotics have gained popularity as a potential source of restoring an ideal gi microbiome to improve symptoms prevent illness and treat disease.

further modulation of the microbiome through administration of probiotics has been demonstrated to help some individuals improve tolerance of medications such as met- formin.several studies have suggested improved behavioral symptoms in children on the autism spectrum after administration of probiotics.

using mouse models researchers have shown that the physical and emotional stress that occurs during exercise may alter the microbiome.

for example probiotics have been shown to be effective for the prevention and treat- ment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea yet the lack of standardization of supplements makes clinical implementation of this knowledge difficult.research suggests that a diverse diet rich in fiber provides an optimized environment to stimulate growth and ac- tivity of the ideal microbiome.

this may be as effective as supplementation with probiot- ics which may or may not contain the ideal bacteria needed by a given individual.fecal microbiota transplantationcollectively these organisms that make up the gut microbiome have more than 100 times more genes than their human host.
