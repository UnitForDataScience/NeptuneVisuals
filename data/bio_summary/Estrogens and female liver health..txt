Obese and overweight women had significantly lower con- centrations of estradiol than non-obese premenopausal women how- ever this trend was reversed after menopause where obese and over- weight women have higher estradiol levels than non-obese women due aromatization of estrogens in adipose tissue.The molecular mechanism of action of estrogens in each tissue isdetermined a by the ER composition of the tissue b by the com- position of coregulators and partnering transcription factors c and notably as we and others have shown also by the activation of genomic vs. non-genomic pathways by estrogens.

By understanding underlying mechanisms of estrogens and mi- crobiota crosstalk we might design dietary and pharmacological interventions to alleviate the metabolic syn- drome and NAFLD.Metabolic health of postmenopausal women and hormone replacement therapyThe prevalence of obesity among women is increasing yet there is no such significant trend for men.

Population studies have demonstrated that while premenopausal women have less NAFLD compared to men postmenopausal women have higher in- cidences of NAFLD than men  which suggests a protective role for estrogens.

Estrogens regulate adipocyte metabolism and induce remodeling of particular adipose depots which are different between premenopausal women and men compared to post-menopausal women .

Postmenopausal women are more susceptible to weight gain fat redistribution and dyslipidemia all major hallmarks of metabolic syndrome associated with increased NAFLD risk.

Currently 70 of postmenopausal women are overweight or obese.

According to 2003-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES data metabolic syndrome is present in about 34 of the population and the rates of metabolic syndrome is increasing among postmenopausal women .

National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI and the American Heart Association AHA identified risk factors for metabolic syndrome as a fasting glucose100 mgdLbloodpressure13085 mm Hgtriglycerides150 mgdL HDL-C  40 mgdL and waist circumference 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women .

In addition having these symptoms is not associated with mortality in older men yet elevated glucose or low HDL levels are strongly associated with mor- tality in older women .Estrogens which are necessary for the development and function of reproductive tissues have many beneficial effects in diverse non-re- productive target tissues such as liver fat pads bone and vasculature.The loss of these benefits and the development of obesity after meno- pause highlights the estrogen receptor especially the receptor subtype ERa as a relevant therapeutic target.
