a Specific Root Length is the product of root length divided by the root dry weight and b Root density is the product of root dry weight divided by root volume.

The proximity bet- ween collection sites might partly explain the genotypic similarities between these two wild accessions.Root phenotypic traits of wild and modern bean accessionsWild accessions A1 and A2 had a similar specific root length SRL ratio of root length and dry weight and a similar root density ratio of dry weight and volume different from the other bean accessions 2.

Different letters indicate statistically significant differences Fisher LSD test.between the other accessions Supplementary Figure S4c.The common bean rhizobacterial diversityAs root exudation profiles may change due to specific root architectural features   we hypothesized that the observed contrasting root morphologies and the genetic divergence between accessions may affect the rhizo- bacterial community composition.

box 338 6700 AH Wageningen The Netherlands.Received 16 December 2016 revised 23 February 2017 accepted14 April 2017 published online 6 June 2017 The effects of the plant genotype on rhizo- sphere microbiome composition has been proposed to be at least in part mediated by quantitative and qualitative differences in root exudate composition 2 3 3 15.

Diversity Array Technology-based genotyping and phenotyping of local common bean accessions showed significant genetic and root architectural differences between wild and modern accessions with a higher specific root length for the wild accessions.

Subsequently we computed the specific root lengthSRLusingtheequation rlrdw and the root tissue density D using the equation rdwrv .

Briefly the entire root system was sampled from the pots soil loosely attached to the roots was removed and subsequently the entire root system was divided in three parts and each was transferred to a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml of LifeGuard Soil Preservation Solution Mo Bio Laboratories.

Also in terms of plant health the Chitinophagaceae family which belongs to the Bacteroidetes has been proposed for their potential role in protection against soil-borne pathogens Linking rhizobacterial community composition with root phenotypic traitsCanonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that the overall variation in rhizobacterial community composition is explained for 11.4 Bonferroni adjusted P  0.002 by the different root phenotypic traits 6a which resembles the percentage of variation 13.5 in rhizobacterial composition explained by the common bean genotype 3b.
