Despite the increasing demand for FMT rigorous exclusion criteria for donors strongly limit the widespread availability of suitable faecal material Konig et al.

Continuous in vitro intestinal fermentation technology IFT with immobilized faecal microbiota mimicking both the planktonic and sessile growth can be used to produce controlled and stable 'artificial' colonic microbiota at high cell density and at large quantity Cinquin et al.
