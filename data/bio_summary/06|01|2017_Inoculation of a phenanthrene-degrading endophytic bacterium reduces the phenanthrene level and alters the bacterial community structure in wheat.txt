values in the same columns followed by the same letter are not significantly different at p  0.05increased from 0.38 to 5.370 in roots and 1.53 to 6.300 in shoots with increases in soil phenanthrene concentration from 0 to 134.64 mg kg-1.as shown in table  a significantly negative correlation was observed between the cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria count in inner wheat tissues and the phenanthrene concentration in soil or in wheat p  0.01 while the pn2 count in inner wheat tissues correlated positively with the phenanthrene contamination level p  0.01. a significantly negative correlation was also given between the cell counts of cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria and those of strain pn2 p  0.01.the colonization of internal wheat tissues by strain pn2 increased the aboriginal endophytic bacteria count significant- ly compared with the absence of pn2 at moderate and high levels of phenanthrene contamination s2 and s3 p  0.05. for example as shown in table  the cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria count in pn2-inoculated wheat roots in s2 soil 6.98 log cfu g-1 fw was significantly higher than that in pn2-free soil subjected to s2 treatment 6.76 log cfu g-1 fw.alpha diversity of endophytic bacteria in wheatthe richness chao index and diversity shannon index of endophytic bacteria in internal wheat tissues at each level of phenanthrene contamination were calculated based on illumina pe250 sequencing analysis table .in general as the level of phenanthrene contamination in- creased the richness of endophytic bacteria in wheat increased in the presence of low and moderate levels of phenanthrene contamination s0-s2 and decreased in the presence of ahigh level of phenanthrene contamination s3.

in addition the diversity and richness of endophytic bacteria in wheat were positively correlated with the cell count of pn2 p  0.05 table .dissimilarities in endophytic bacterial community composition in wheatpcoa was used to evaluate the effects of various levels of phenanthrene contamination and pn2 inoculation on the en- dophytic bacterial community of the inner tissue of wheattable 2 the cell counts of pn2 and cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria in wheattreatmentspn2 log cfu g-1 fwcultivable aboriginal endophyticbacteria log cfu g-1 fwproportion of pn2 to total bacteria 0s0 is the control soil without phenanthrene addition.

these results revealed that not only plant species and pollution level determine the count and diversity of endophytic bacteria but also that colonization by functional endophytic bacterium in- fluences the biomass diversity and richness of the endophytic bacterial population.moreover inoculation of wheat with pn2 affected the rela- tive abundances of the dominant endophytic bacterial taxa which may influence the capacity of the plant to metabolize phenanthrene.

although this study is limited in making broad con- clusions due to the use of a single bacterial strain and plant host and the interaction between the endophytic bacterial community and the plant capacity of phenanthrene metabo- lism requires further investigation the results of this investi- gation provide insight into the responses of endophytic bacte- rial community in plant to external phenanthrene contamina- tion and prove that the impacts of pdeb colonization on the bacterial community in inner plant tissues depend on the level of phenanthrene contamination.acknowledgements this work was supported by the major state basic research development program of china 973 program 2015cb150505 the fundamental research funds for the central universities kyz201516 the natural science foundation of jiangsu province bk20161454 the special fund for agro-scientific research in public interest china 201503107 and a project funded by the priority academic program development of jiangsu higher education institutions papd.compliance with ethical standardsethical statement this article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.conflict of interest the authors declared that they have no conflict of interest.referencesafzal m khan qm sessitsch a 2014 endophytic bacteria prospects and applications for the phytoremediation of organic pollutants.

the phenanthrene recovery from the soil and plant samples was 95 n  5 relative stan- dard deviation rsd  2.52.to investigate the phenanthrene removal by strain pn2 in wheat roots shoots and soils the enhancement ratio e  was estimated according to the following equation e   ccp - ccpb  ccp x 100 where ccpb and ccp are the phenanthrene concentrations in wheat roots shoots or soils with and without pn2 inoc- ulation respectively.phenanthrene accumulation in wheat roots and shoots a mgpot-1 was calculated using the following equation a  cp x m where cp mg kg-1 is the phenanthrene concen- tration in wheat root or shoot and m mgpot-1 on a dry weight basis is the biomass of wheat root or shoot in each pot.

these results indicated that although phenanthrene contamination and pn2 inoculation influenced the endophytic bacterial com- munity the proportions of the majority of the endophytic bac- terial taxa were unaffected.endophytic bacterial community structure in wheatthe endophytic bacteria in wheat roots belonged to 18 phyla fig.

the inoculation of pn2 significantly increased the cell counts of aboriginal endophytic bacteria indicating that strain pn2 degraded phenanthrene in inner plant tissues and thus ameliorated the phenanthrene-inhibited growth of aboriginal endophytic bacteria.endophytic bacteria in plants are of great diversity among which proteobacteria has been reported to be the dominant phylum hallmann et al.

meanwhile significantly positive correlation was also observed between the richness of endophytic bacteria in inner wheat tissues and the level of phenanthrene contamination p  0.01.furthermore inoculation of strain pn2 increased the diver- sity and richness of endophytic bacteria in wheat at a given level of phenanthrene contamination.

wheat tissue contained 3.74 to 4.53 log cfu g-1 fwof pn2 in roots and 2.88 to 3.38 log cfu g-1 fw of pn2 in shoots.as the phenanthrene concentration increased the number of cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria in wheat de- creased significantly particularly in roots p  0.05 while pn2 counts increased gradually with increasing levels of phen- anthrene contamination.

the plant translocation factor tf is defined as the ratio of the shoot phenanthrene concentration factor scf to the root phenanthrene concentration factor rcf which was equal to the ratio of phenanthrene concen- tration in wheat shoot cshoot to that in root croot tf  scf  rcf  cshoot  croot.enumeration of pn2 and cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria in wheatafter being collected wheat samples were rinsed three times with deionized water and subsequently sterilized by sequential immersion in 75 vv ethanol for 3-5 min 2 sodium hy- pochlorite vv for 3 min and 70 ethanol for 30 s. then wheat samples were washed three times with sterilized dis- tilled water to remove residual surface sterilization agents sobral et al.

although the phenanthrene concen- tration in soil with pn2 inoculation was a little lower p  0.05 than that with no pn2 control under s3 the efficacy was much weaker than that in wheat roots or shoots.the accumulation of phenanthrene in wheat roots and shoots a mgpot-1 was also reduced by pn2 inoculation.

moreover the phenanthrene concentration in inner wheat tis- sues inoculated with pn2 was lower than that in wheat not inoculated with pn2 indicating that the presence of large num- bers of pn2 in plant tissues reduced the level of phenanthrene contamination.it has well been documented that large numbers of endo- phytic bacteria present in inner plant tissues.

the cell count of cultivable aboriginal endophytic bac- teria in wheat was calculated as the difference in value d value of the number of cultivable endophytic bacterial cells and the number of pn2 cells.dna extraction and pcr amplificationdirectly sequencing the entire endophytic bacterial communi- ty is more accurate for analysis of the community composition in plants than cultivation method huse et al.

in wheat shoots inoc- ulated with pn2 was markedly lower than that in wheat shoots not inoculated with pn2 in s0-s3 soils table s2 in supplementary materials.a hierarchical cluster dendrogram of endophytic bacterial community was generated based on the bray-curtis distance indices calculated using otus at a distance of 3 to further examine the similarity of endophytic bacterial community in wheat samples fig.

cp means treatment with wheat but no pn2 inoculation in soil and cpb means treatment with wheat and pn2 inoculationin summary this is a primary investigation into the effect of colonization by a pdeb strain pn2 on the endophytic bacte- rial community structure in a phenanthrene-contaminated plant.
