In addition the diversity and richness of endophytic bacteria in wheat were positively correlated with the cell count of Pn2 p  0.05 Table .Dissimilarities in endophytic bacterial community composition in wheatPCoA was used to evaluate the effects of various levels of phenanthrene contamination and Pn2 inoculation on the en- dophytic bacterial community of the inner tissue of wheatTable 2 The cell counts of Pn2 and cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria in wheatTreatmentsPn2 log CFU g-1 FWCultivable aboriginal endophyticbacteria log CFU g-1 FWProportion of Pn2 to total bacteria 0S0 is the control soil without phenanthrene addition.

For example as shown in Table  the cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria count in Pn2-inoculated wheat roots in S2 soil 6.98 log CFU g-1 FW was significantly higher than that in Pn2-free soil subjected to S2 treatment 6.76 log CFU g-1 FW.Alpha diversity of endophytic bacteria in wheatThe richness Chao index and diversity Shannon index of endophytic bacteria in internal wheat tissues at each level of phenanthrene contamination were calculated based on Illumina PE250 sequencing analysis Table .In general as the level of phenanthrene contamination in- creased the richness of endophytic bacteria in wheat increased in the presence of low and moderate levels of phenanthrene contamination S0-S2 and decreased in the presence of ahigh level of phenanthrene contamination S3.

A significantly negative correlation was also given between the cell counts of cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria and those of strain Pn2 p  0.01.The colonization of internal wheat tissues by strain Pn2 increased the aboriginal endophytic bacteria count significant- ly compared with the absence of Pn2 at moderate and high levels of phenanthrene contamination S2 and S3 p  0.05.

These results revealed that not only plant species and pollution level determine the count and diversity of endophytic bacteria but also that colonization by functional endophytic bacterium in- fluences the biomass diversity and richness of the endophytic bacterial population.Moreover inoculation of wheat with Pn2 affected the rela- tive abundances of the dominant endophytic bacterial taxa which may influence the capacity of the plant to metabolize phenanthrene.

The phenanthrene recovery from the soil and plant samples was 95 n  5 relative stan- dard deviation RSD  2.52.To investigate the phenanthrene removal by strain Pn2 in wheat roots shoots and soils the enhancement ratio E  was estimated according to the following equation E   CCP - CCPB  CCP x 100 where CCPB and CCP are the phenanthrene concentrations in wheat roots shoots or soils with and without Pn2 inoc- ulation respectively.Phenanthrene accumulation in wheat roots and shoots A mgpot-1 was calculated using the following equation A  Cp x M where Cp mg kg-1 is the phenanthrene concen- tration in wheat root or shoot and M mgpot-1 on a dry weight basis is the biomass of wheat root or shoot in each pot.

These results indicated that although phenanthrene contamination and Pn2 inoculation influenced the endophytic bacterial com- munity the proportions of the majority of the endophytic bac- terial taxa were unaffected.Endophytic bacterial community structure in wheatThe endophytic bacteria in wheat roots belonged to 18 phyla Fig.

Wheat tissue contained 3.74 to 4.53 log CFU g-1 FWof Pn2 in roots and 2.88 to 3.38 log CFU g-1 FW of Pn2 in shoots.As the phenanthrene concentration increased the number of cultivable aboriginal endophytic bacteria in wheat de- creased significantly particularly in roots p  0.05 while Pn2 counts increased gradually with increasing levels of phen- anthrene contamination.

The inoculation of Pn2 significantly increased the cell counts of aboriginal endophytic bacteria indicating that strain Pn2 degraded phenanthrene in inner plant tissues and thus ameliorated the phenanthrene-inhibited growth of aboriginal endophytic bacteria.Endophytic bacteria in plants are of great diversity among which Proteobacteria has been reported to be the dominant phylum Hallmann et al.

Although the phenanthrene concen- tration in soil with Pn2 inoculation was a little lower p  0.05 than that with no Pn2 control under S3 the efficacy was much weaker than that in wheat roots or shoots.The accumulation of phenanthrene in wheat roots and shoots A mgpot-1 was also reduced by Pn2 inoculation.

Meanwhile significantly positive correlation was also observed between the richness of endophytic bacteria in inner wheat tissues and the level of phenanthrene contamination p  0.01.Furthermore inoculation of strain Pn2 increased the diver- sity and richness of endophytic bacteria in wheat at a given level of phenanthrene contamination.
