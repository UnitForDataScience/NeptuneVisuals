The goal of this study was to demonstrate that the NSP4 VPD forms an ion channel and determine whether the channel can conduct Ca2.

The NSP4 VPD was selective for cations over anions and channel activity was observed to have both well-defined square top openings as well as fast current fluctuations similar to other viroporins.

The primary sequence of the VPD-Mut peptide details the mutations underlined in the amphipathic domain.ER Ca2 these data confirmed that NSP4 viroporin activity is responsible for the loss of ER Ca2 in RV-infected cells and is the trigger for elevating Ca2c which is critical for RV replication.Our previously proposed model in which NSP4 viroporin activity depletes ER Ca2 implies that the NSP4 viroporin domain forms a pore or ion channel that can conduct Ca2.

The purpose of this study was to first demonstrate that the NSP4 viroporin domain is able to form a bona fide ion channel and to determine whether NSP4 viroporin domain ion channels can conduct Ca2 ions.

The measured open channel current for each voltage was plotted and a linear regression line fitted to determine the reversal potential.

The c denotes the closed level of conductance and the o represents the open level of the channel obtained from well-defined openings.

The average single channel current pA is plotted for each voltage mV from -100 mV to 100 mVin 10 mV steps.

The NSP4 VPD channel was capable of conducting K Ca2 and Ba2 ions and shows a strong selectivity for cations over anions but interestingly it was not selective for Ca2 over K ions.

The lack of Ca2 selectivity is likely not an impediment to the release of ER Ca2 in RV-infected cells because the 1000-5000 fold Ca2 gradient across the ER membrane enables a sustained Ca2 current even through a non-selective channel.

The well-defined opening events of NSP4 display a conductance in the range of 40-60 pS similar to the conductance of L-type calcium channels and it is possible that NSP4 could be blocked by L-type calcium channel blockers such as the benzothiazepine dihydropyridine or phenylalkylamine classes of blockers which are widely used clinically even in children.
