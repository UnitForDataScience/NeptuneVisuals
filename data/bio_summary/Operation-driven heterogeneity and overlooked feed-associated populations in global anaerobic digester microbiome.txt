Smithella related OTUs were observed in clusters B E F G and H whereas Syntrophomonas related OTUs were observed in clusters with high salinity cluster A industrial influent cluster C and high operating temperature cluster D. For the methanogenic core populations there was asimilar trend that an OTU related to Candidatus Methanofastidiosa hydrogenotrophic methanogen and an OTU related to Meth- anosaeta aceticlastic methanogen were consistently observed in clusters B E F G and H. The high-temperature cluster D contained two unique core OTUs related to Methanothermobacter and Meth- anoculleus.

S5C where only two samples diverged from cluster G and three samples diverged from cluster H compared to the results based on weighted UniFrac.Characterization of feed-derived residue populationsOur previous study revealed that in a single wastewater treat- ment plant AD microbial communities could contain exogenous populations i.e.

In contrast within each cluster OTUs shared by all the samples accounted for a large portion of the total sequences 50 in each cluster Fig.

Thus we defined cluster-specific core populations  by including OTUs that were both prevalent and abundant top 15 abundant bacterial and top three abundant archaeal OTUs that were detected in all samples of that cluster.

In total 704 residue OTUs were associated with Proteobacteria and 298 OTUs with Bacteroidetes accounting for 20.8 and 13.4 of sequences in feed sludge respectively A. Abundances of these OTUs in the AD community decreased drastically to 3.6 and 1.6 respectively.

However the variance could not be explained by geographical locations as only North America samples significantly differed from Hong Kong samples in PC1 and from Japan samples in PC2.

Plants that have samples not clustered together are marked.was 0.02 in USSF1 that received feed sludge after pretreatment and the majority 117 out of 148 AD samples were less than 10.

Fifty milliliters of sludge were collected from the recirculation lines of digesters transported to laboratory in UIUC onice including international samples and stored at 80 0C untilDNA extraction.16S rRNA gene sequencingGenomic DNA was extracted from 2 mL of well-mixed sludge using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil MP Biomedicals Carlsbad CA USA and quantified using a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer.

By removing residue populations from each community we observed almost no change on the beta-diversity and the clus- tering remained almost the same based on either weighted UniFrac only seven samples split from cluster H or Bray-Curtis distance only cluster E split.

Seven plants JPHW JPMU JPNA JPSTJPTB JPYS and USDV used a two-stage anaerobic digestion process with similar sludge retention time the first digester treating sludge from primarysecondary clarifiers and the second digester treating sludge from the first digester.
