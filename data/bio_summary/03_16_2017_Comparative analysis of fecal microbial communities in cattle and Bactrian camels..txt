domestic bactrian camels inhabit semi-arid plains while wild bactrian camels prefer a habitat of arid plains and hills where plants and water are scarce.we hypothesized that the different digestive systems environments and eating habits of bactrian camels and cattle would lead to distinctive intestinal microbial flora.

the fresh fecal samples were transported to the laboratory on dry ice within 24 h of collection and then stored at -80c until dna extraction.fecal sample collectionfresh fecal samples were collected from 94 individual animals inner mongolian cattleimg-cattle n  14 inner mongolian domestic bactrian camels img-dbc n  65 mon- golian domestic bactrian camels mg-dbc n  3 and mongolian wild bactrian camels mg-wbc n  12. the img-cattle group belonged to the mongolian breed which is very robust and healthy with strong bones.

in the process of sampling we found that there were three domestic bactrian camels in the wild bactrian camel herd and these domestic camels had the same diet and environment as the wild camels.

in this study we collected fecal samples from cattle and camels to research their microbial communities.competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist.the domestic bactrian camel camelus bactrianus plays numerous socioeconomic roles in the lives of millions of people in semi-dry and arid regions these camels are used for draught power transport wool production milk and meat.

here we used miseq sequencing of hypervariable 16s rrna and comparative analysis to investigate the gastrointestinal microbiomes from 94 individuals belonging to four population groups cattle img-cattle and domestic bactrian camels img-dbc from inner mongolia china and domestic mg-dbc and wild bactrian camels mg-wbc from gobi-altai mongolia.materials and methodsno specific permits were required for the field studies described in this work.

the cattle img-cattle and domestic bactrian camels img-dbc from inner mongolia china and domestic bactrian camelsmg-dbc from gobi-altai mongolia are not endangered or protected species however the wild bactrian camels mg-wbc from gobi-altai mongolia are endangered or protected spe- cies.

we hypothe- sized that having the same environment and eating habits may result in the same intestinal microbial biota in the mongolian wild and domestic bactrian camels because we found only three individual domestic bactrian camels we sampled these.in this study the four population groups grazed freely.

these places have scarce water sources and sparse vegetation and the wild and domestic bactrian camels from gobi-altai feed mainly on shrubs trees and very little vegetation which means their diet is rel- atively simplified.this comparative work showed that camels from different locations and environments shared similar fecal microbial composition.

2017 comparative analysis of fecal microbial communities in cattle and bactrian camels.

a similar result was determined by principal component analysis in which the camels grouped together.

domestic and wild bactrian camels are resilient animals that can tolerate harsh climate extremes of weather and variable temperature.
