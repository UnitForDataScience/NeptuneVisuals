The fresh fecal samples were transported to the laboratory on dry ice within 24 h of collection and then stored at -80C until DNA extraction.Fecal sample collectionFresh fecal samples were collected from 94 individual animals Inner Mongolian cattleIMG-Cattle n  14 Inner Mongolian domestic Bactrian camels IMG-DBC n  65 Mon- golian domestic Bactrian camels MG-DBC n  3 and Mongolian wild Bactrian camels MG-WBC n  12.

Detailed characteristics of four population groups in this study.1IMG-Cattle cattle from Inner Mongolia IMG-DBC domestic Bactrian camels from Inner Mongolia MG-DBC domestic Bactrian camels from Mongolia MG-WBC wild Bactrian camels from Mongolia.Resultsgives detailed characteristics of the four study population groups.

Domestic Bactrian camels inhabit semi-arid plains while wild Bactrian camels prefer a habitat of arid plains and hills where plants and water are scarce.We hypothesized that the different digestive systems environments and eating habits of Bactrian camels and cattle would lead to distinctive intestinal microbial flora.

In the process of sampling we found that there were three domestic Bactrian camels in the wild Bactrian camel herd and these domestic camels had the same diet and environment as the wild camels.

Blue represents the minimum relative abundance and red the maximum.Principal component analysis PCA with weighted UniFrac distance analysis of the microbiomes from the four animal populations.the GI microbial community in Inner Mongolian cattle Inner Mongolian domestic Bactrian camels Mongolian domestic Bactrian camels and Mongolian wild Bactrian camels using a high-throughput Illumina MiSeq approach.Because of the limited number of individuals in the Mongolian domestic Bactrian camel group n  3 we did not undertake analysis of the number of OTUs richness diversity or bacterial community composition in this group.

Here we used MiSeq sequencing of hypervariable 16S rRNA and comparative analysis to investigate the gastrointestinal microbiomes from 94 individuals belonging to four population groups cattle IMG-Cattle and domestic Bactrian camels IMG-DBC from Inner Mongolia China and domestic MG-DBC and wild Bactrian camels MG-WBC from Gobi-Altai Mongolia.Materials and methodsNo specific permits were required for the field studies described in this work.

The cattle IMG-Cattle and domestic Bactrian camels IMG-DBC from Inner Mongolia China and domestic Bactrian camelsMG-DBC from Gobi-Altai Mongolia are not endangered or protected species however the wild Bactrian camels MG-WBC from Gobi-Altai Mongolia are endangered or protected spe- cies.

Acidobacteria was detected only in the IMG-DBC population group Chlamydiae was found in the Bactrian camel population groups IMG-DBC and MG-WBC while Deinococcus-Thermus Fusobac- teria and Gemmatimonadetes were discovered in the Inner Mongolian cattle and camel popu- lation groups IMG-Cattle and IMG-DBC.

In this study we collected fecal samples from cattle and camels to research their microbial communities.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.The domestic Bactrian camel Camelus bactrianus plays numerous socioeconomic roles in the lives of millions of people in semi-dry and arid regions these camels are used for draught power transport wool production milk and meat.
