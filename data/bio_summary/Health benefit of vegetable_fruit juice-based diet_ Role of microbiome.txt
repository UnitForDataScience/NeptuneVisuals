Effect of juice based diet on fecal microbiota phylum comparing baseline day 0 after the juice intervention day 4 and after two weeks of customary diet day 17.

The juice consumption however was associated with a significant decrease in the proportion of the bacterial phylum Firmicutes p  0.014 and increase in Bacteroidetes p  0.026 and Cyanobacteria 0.003 at day 4 compared to baseline and was partially reversed to baseline proportions at day 17 Fig.

.On the genus level the following bacterial populations were also significantly increased at day 4 compared to baseline percent of baseline Halospirulina 1467 Paraprevotella 348 Barnesiella 200 Odoribacter 200 and Bacteroides 144 Table .

On the other hand proportions of the following bacterial genera were decreased significantly at day 4 compared to baseline percent of baseline Streptococcus 8 Subdoligranulum 30 Eisenbergiella 40 Ruminiclostridium 50 and Dialister 67 Table .

Urine MDA was signifi- cantly decreased by 40 in 6-hour urine collected at day 4 compared to baseline urine p 0.01 and returned to baseline levels at day 17 Fig.

The proportional abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was significantly decreased while Bacteroidetes was significantly increased when comparing end of juice based diet day 4 to baseline Table .

All participants completed a general well-being questionnaire at baseline day 4 and at the end of study.

Since the microbiota changes mostly returned to baseline levels it appears unlikely that changes in the well-being were related to the gut microbiota.

Products of fibercomplex carbohydrate metabolism are short chain fatty acids which have been shown to play an important role in the cardiovascular health benefits of fiber consumption.The only other human study investigating the effect of juice based diet on changes in the gut microbiota was published by Remely et al..

The distribution of 16S rDNA genes at the phylum level was composed of Firmicutes  Bacteroidetes  Proteobacteria  Verrucomicrobia  Actinobacteria 52 - 4 41 - 4 2.3 - 1 2.3 - 1 and 5 - 4 respectively.
