two days are required by FPP compared to up to four days when using classical methods while it is also relative straight-forwards and reliable in contrast to DNA microarray it is based on non-modified oligonu- cleotides while the bioinformatic analysis will avoid false negative results.Taken altogether our findings highlight the usefulness of FPP as a method to simultaneously rapidly and reliably detect various well- known FBPs.

FPP was evaluated by means of in silico and in vitro end-point PCR using DNA from selected FBPs while specificity sensitivity and the use of multiplex PCR were validated and optimized employing single- or mixed- DNA template experiments.

Despite the low number of specific reads the FPP was able to detect each of the purposely added FBPs such as C. jejuni and L. monocytogenes as well as C. jejuni L. monocytogenes and S. enteritidis in swordfish and poultry meat respectively a.In order to validate the FPP protocol for FBP detection in a food chain control procedure the assay was also applied to naturally contaminated food samples.

Regarding fish and poultry samples FBP species usually associated with FBDs in these matrices were identified using the FPP approach and are illustrated in c and d respectively.Sensitivity of FPPWe tested the sensitivity and efficiency of FPP compared to culture dependent methods for the identification of FBPs.

The number of reads linked to each FBP gene was counted with HTseq-count  and a text file report was generated in the output folder.ResultsPCR primer design for FBP identificationIn order to develop a specific and reliable assay for FBP identifica- tion suitable for Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology we screened available literature for primer pairs that had previously been described for the detection of common FBPs.

Samples were tested with classical end-point PCR using FPP oligonucleotides to verify that food matrices were not contaminated with test organisms.During FPP assay validation samples that were deemed to be FBP- free were deliberately contaminated with varying amounts of FBPs.

Moreover a possible improvement of FPP could involve the inclusion of a specific quantification step for the different FBPs thus allowing the use of FPP not only for qualitative but also for quantifica- tion purposes.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at .AcknowledgementsThis work was funded by the EU Joint Programming Initiative - A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life JPI HDHL  and MIUR to MV.

Finally this newly developed FPP approach was applied to trace FBPs in naturally contaminated food matrices.Materials and methodsBacterial strains and DNA extractionBacterial strains and culture media used in this work are listed in .

Barcoded DNA fragments were enriched and cleaned- up Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA sample preparation guide Part15041110Rev.D Illumina.From the concentration and the average size of each amplicon library the amount of DNA fragments per microliter was calculated and libraries for each run were diluted to the proper concentration prior to clonal amplification.

Specificity was assessed as follows each oligonucleotide pair was tested using the DNA of the targeted FBP as well as using DNA isolated from control species in order to test that no cross amplification was taking place.
