This suggests not only an individual evolution of microbial communities even for the case that BGPs are started at the same initial conditions under well controlled environmental conditions but also a high compositional variance of microbiomes under extreme conditions.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Method validation confirmed a limit of quantification for the undiluted samples under 0.5 mM formate0.40 mM acetate 0.23 mM lactate 0.25 mM propionate0.28 mM butyrate 0.18 mM.ResultsAbiotic process dataAfter a short delay during the first two weeks of enrichment start-up phase the daily biogas production increased to0.481 - 0.09 NL L-1d-1 for R1 0.500 - 0.09 NL Lto less than 125 NL L-1d-1 after day 200 e. The methane content of the produced biogas was also stable for all regimes with small fluctuations R1 53.41 - 6.3 CH4 R2 53.6 - 6.2 CH4 R3 53.2 - 6.3 CH4 R4 53.5 - 5.9 CH4 R554.5 - 7.9 CH4 R6 54.3 - 7.4 CH4.

Nevertheless the fact that nearly all technical replicates formed distinct branches in the cluster tree  suffixes 1 and 2 whereas the different process regimes were clearly separated validated the applied experimental workflow.Proteotyping indicates multiple steady-states of microbial communitiesThe six biogas reactors running in parallel under well-defined conditions which were inoculated with the same starting mate- rial showed a similar behavior for the first 93 d regarding the production of biogas pH value and the content of VFA e. However SDS-PAGE of proteins  LC-MSMS of tryptic pep- tides  and T-RFLP of 16S rRNA genes suggested clear dif- ferences in community composition e. As a time period of 93 d is rather short for a full adaption of microbial communities from the inoculum to laboratory conditions the latter results might represent intermediate states of enrichment only.

Elevated acetate concentrations 10 mM were only found during the very late phase of R5 and R6 240e298 d.Community fingerprintingSDS-PAGE of protein extracts was performed for the inoculum sample prefix Ino as a reference for monitoring of the impact of process conditions on the microbiomes and the process samples of day 93 and 261 .

It enabled a clear differentiation of the two stable microbial communities of the thermophilic regimes and the establishment of hypotheses regarding their discrepancy on structural and functional level.ConclusionsProteotyping is a sensitive tool for characterization of microbial communities in laboratory-scale reactors and full-scale BGP.

Protein patterns of the inoculum Ino mesophilic reactors R1 and R2 thermophilic reactors R3 and R4 and high-N reactors R5 and R6 25 mg of protein were loaded per lane and sample.

Interest- ingly the samples from the high-N regimes R5 R6 resembled the inoculum.To identify reasons for the large variations in the microbial communities of the six enrichments day 93 the identified taxo- nomic orders were depicted in box plots .
