this suggests not only an individual evolution of microbial communities even for the case that bgps are started at the same initial conditions under well controlled environmental conditions but also a high compositional variance of microbiomes under extreme conditions.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.abbreviations 6-fam 6-carboxyfluorescein ad anaerobic digestion acn acetonitrile rt room temperature 21 oc bp base pair bgp biogas plant fa formic acid hrt hydraulic retention time ino inoculum sample lc liquid chro- matography m mesophilic sample ms mass spectrometryspectrometer msms tandem ms nhigh-n process with high load of nitrogen source r reactor sao syntrophic acetate oxidation sds-page sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis spc spectral count t thermophilic sample trf terminal re- striction fragment vfa volatile fatty acids xcge-lif multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection.

nevertheless the fact that nearly all technical replicates formed distinct branches in the cluster tree  suffixes 1 and 2 whereas the different process regimes were clearly separated validated the applied experimental workflow.proteotyping indicates multiple steady-states of microbial communitiesthe six biogas reactors running in parallel under well-defined conditions which were inoculated with the same starting mate- rial showed a similar behavior for the first 93 d regarding the production of biogas ph value and the content of vfa e. however sds-page of proteins  lc-msms of tryptic pep- tides  and t-rflp of 16s rrna genes suggested clear dif- ferences in community composition e. as a time period of 93 d is rather short for a full adaption of microbial communities from the inoculum to laboratory conditions the latter results might represent intermediate states of enrichment only.

it enabled a clear differentiation of the two stable microbial communities of the thermophilic regimes and the establishment of hypotheses regarding their discrepancy on structural and functional level.conclusionsproteotyping is a sensitive tool for characterization of microbial communities in laboratory-scale reactors and full-scale bgp.

while samples from the mesophilic reactors r1 r2 were clustered in a common branch samples from the thermophilic reactors r3 r4 were clearly separated from all other samples and from themselves.

interest- ingly the samples from the high-n regimes r5 r6 resembled the inoculum.to identify reasons for the large variations in the microbial communities of the six enrichments day 93 the identified taxo- nomic orders were depicted in box plots .

most likely small differences in the composition of microbial communities direct theirdevelopment into different states after changes in process condi- tions as shown for the thermophilic laboratory-scale regimes r3 r4 in the following.considering the level of metaproteins instead groups of bio- logical functions methanogenic metaproteins of archaeal meth- anosarcina were decreased in r3 as a result of the shift to thermophilic conditions.

since building of consensus trf influ- enced the total trf sums the normalizations of trf to the total trf intensities of a sample were repeated before comparing samples on basis of respective consensus profiles.
