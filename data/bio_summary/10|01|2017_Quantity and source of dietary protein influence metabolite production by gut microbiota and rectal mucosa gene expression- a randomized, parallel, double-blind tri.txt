Participants received either dietary supplements composed of plant protein isolated soy protein Su- pro670IP Solae for the soy protein group SOY group animal protein milk protein isolate enriched in micellar casein 92 Pro- diet85B Ingredia for the casein group CAS group or digestible carbohydrate as an isocaloric control maltodextrin Glucidex19 Roquette for the maltodextrin group MD group.

Moreover the effects of HPDs according to the source of protein need to be considered in this context.Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the quantity and source of dietary protein on microbiota composi- tion bacterial metabolite production and consequences for the large intestinal mucosa in humans.Design A randomized double-blind parallel-design trial was con- ducted in 38 overweight individuals who received a 3-wk isocaloric supplementation with casein soy protein or maltodextrin as a con- trol.

Thus it is worth noting that for the other 50 of dietary proteins the precise con- sumption by the volunteers according to protein source remains unknown a situation that might have introduced some in- terindividual variability in terms of dietary protein intake.

Participants' body weights remained approximately stable during the dietary in- tervention and metabolic parameters in the fasting state were not affected by the amount of protein intake apart from a sig- nificant decrease in systolic blood pressure in the SOY group that might be related to soy protein-associated isoflavones Supplemental Table 1.Microbiota compositionComparisons of the relative abundances of each taxonomic group from both fecal and rectal biopsy samples with the use generalized estimating equation analyses did not reveal signifi- cant changes between dietary treatments due to high interindividual variation observed for each taxonomic group Supplemental Figure 2.

Comparison of a and b diversity between dietary treatments with the use of species diversity metrics and principal coordinates analyses respectively also revealed no significant changes nor patterns in diversity over the course of the intervention period data not shown.Effects of dietary protein on fecal metabolomeChanges from baseline in the fecal metabolome were assessed with the use of untargeted 1H-NMR metabolomics and targeted measurements of the main bacterial metabolites.

Compared with theCAS group and the MD group the SOY group had a higher relative concentration of several AA-derived bacterial metabo- lites valerate phenylacetate and tyramine Figure 2B C. Targeted measurements confirmed that an increase in protein intake induced a shift toward protein fermentation by the gutDIETARY PROTEIN AND GUT HEALTH1013microbiota because the concentrations of AA-derived SCFAs were increased with specificities according to protein source used in the HPD Supplemental Table 3.

Interestingly the relative concentrations of 3-hydroxyisovalerate 3-hydroxybutyrate and the cometabolite p-cresyl sulfate wereDIETARY PROTEIN AND GUT HEALTH1015higher in the CAS group only Figure 4A C. Two signals putatively assigned to acetoin and isoflavone were detected only in the SOY group Figure 4B C. Last the abundance of Butyricimonas was positively correlated with the urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate and phenylacetylglutamine Figure 4D.Effects of dietary protein on plasma metabolomeIn contrast to fecal and urinary metabolomes the effects of protein intake on changes from baseline in plasma metabolome were not related to the metabolic activity of the microbiota and were mostly characterized by a higher relative concentration of free AA creatinine and urea Supplemental Figure 4 Supple- mental Table 6.Fecal water cytotoxicityThe effects of fecal waters on the viability of HT-29 cells were not affected by diet Figure 5A.

Collectively these results show that a HPD by itself is not sufficient to induce mucosal inflammation after 3 wk the effects were restricted to gene expression.In the HPD groups w50 of dietary protein was provided bythe supplement casein or soy protein.
