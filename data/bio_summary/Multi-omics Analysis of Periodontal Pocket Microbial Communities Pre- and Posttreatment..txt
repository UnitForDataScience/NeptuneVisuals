The mean per-sample abundance of metabolic features MS1 data was also strongly correlated with MPD with a much lower P value than with the 16S rRNA data rho  0.21 P  0.0001 suggesting that metabolite abundance may be a more sensitive indicator of community status in regard to changes in periodontal disease status.Beta diversity analyses between-sample comparisons of biodiversity on the other hand found no clear relationship between disease class and subgingival or supragin- gival diversity within the 16S rRNA shotgun metagenomic or metabolomic data sets either pre- or posttreatment  data not shown.

Moreover our time series analysis of the metabolomic features showed that diversity moved in the opposite direction with respect to taxonomic diversity suggesting that the addition of MS information could add an important new dimension to our understanding of periodontal disease dynamics.Similar to previous NGS studies of periodontal disease   analysis of the 16S rRNA data set found a positive relationship between the within-sample PD Faith's PDof subgingival samples and periodontal pocket depth MPD pretreatment Spearman's rank correlation rho  0.27 P  0.01.

Overall our study demonstrated how combining multi-omics data sets provides deeper insight into periodontal disease and showed the promise of MSMS in particular for enhancing our understanding of periodontal biofilm dynamics.RESULTSDNA was successfully extracted from a total of 218 subgingival and 73 supragingival samples from 34 individuals and 287 of these samples from 33 of the 34 individuals produced sufficient 16S rRNA amplicon product for next-generation sequencing NGS see Table S1 in the supplemental material.

Our analysis of instability based on the 16S rRNA data found significantly greater CIS in periodontal pockets that did not improve than in pockets that improved while analysis of the Bray-Curtis distances calculated on the basis of the MSMS metabolite features found the exact opposite .DISCUSSIONThe etiology of periodontal disease has proven to be especially difficult to disen- tangle because of both the complexity of the periodontal biofilm community and the high level of individual variability among patients in both bacterial composition and treatment outcomes.

Single-marker gene studies assaying bacterial diversity using small-subunit rRNA gene sequences 16S rRNA have revealed highly complex and distinct periodon- tal disease communities associated with healthy and diseased pockets even within the same mouth .

Genera such as Desulfovibrio Achole- plasma Mogibacterium and Scardovia have all been identified in the oral cavities of humans or animals and can be found in the HOMID database  but their specific roles in periodontal disease are unknown.Genus- and species-level analyses of posttreatment samples showed an almost complete turnover in the 20 most abundant taxa for both the 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic data.

The combination of 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics complemented each other in the analysis of taxonomic diver- sity.
