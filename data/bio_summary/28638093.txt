Although the fatty acid FA composition of the milk lipids to some extent reflects the maternal diet the major FAs are always capric acid C100 lauric acid C120 myristic acid C140 palmitic acid C160 palmitoleic acid C161 stearic acid C180 oleic acid C181 and linoleic acid C182-.

A Acetic acid B Propionic acid C Butyric acid D iso-valeric acid E iso-butyric acid and F Caprioic acid.

PC Principal Component MPL Milk phospholipids CO Coconut oil RO Rapeseed oil SL Soy lecithin.Univariate statistical analysis showed that only a few bacterial families were significantly differently affected by the type of emulsifier but when considering the entire community composition by PCA significant effects were observed.Emulsification in SL thus led to a bacterial composition characterized by more Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae while emulsification in MPL led to a relative increase of Porphyromonadaseae Fig.

Both the PL-type used for emulsification and the FA composition of the TAG in infant formula -mimicking emulsions given during gut colonization might affect the microbial composition.

However we find that the lack of bifidobacteria did not necessarily affect the relevance of the mouse model for studies of effects of dietary factors on other bacterial strains.Within each group the bacterial composition was seen to be quite similar at Days 5 and 12 while a dif- ferent microbiota was present at Day 2 Fig.

.DiscussionThis study aimed to investigate whether intake of oil types characterized by either MCFA or LCFA and of emul- sions based on SL or MPLs during infant microbiota establishment led to differences in the bacterial composition.
