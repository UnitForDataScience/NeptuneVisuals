anaerococcus lactolyticus the phylogenetically closest validated species was first isolated from vaginal discharges like strain marseille p2765t.because strain marseille p2765 is more than 2.8 divergent in the 16s rrna gene sequence with its closest phylogenetic neighbour  we propose that it may be the representative strain of a novel species named 'anaerococcus mediterraneensis' me.di.ter.ra.ne.en0sis l. masc.

this degree of similarity was lower than the 98.7 threshold to define a new species  and we pro- pose that strain marseille p2765 be considered representative of a new species within the anaerococcus genus in the phylum firmicutes.
