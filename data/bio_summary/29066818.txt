Interestingly the top 20 OTUs overall in FW fish only accounted for 12079 sequences whereas in the overall SW fish group 31790 sequences were mapped to the top 20 OTUs suggesting higher microbial diversity in FW samples.

Nineteen OTUs were found to be shared overall with accessory cores in the respective life cycle stage groups FW 12 OTUs SW  21 OTUs.The common OTUs mapped predominantly to lactic acid bacteria LAB phylum Firmicutes n  10 well known intestinal microbes including EscherichiaShigella phylum Proteobacteria and Mycoplasma spp.

238 OTUs were found to have a statistically different abundance with 193 OTUs having a higher abundance in the FW group and 45 OTUs in the SW group Supplementary Table .Figure 1.

FW fish did not only harbour an increased number of unique and higher abundant OTUs these OTUs also mapped to a larger variety of phyla and genera compared to the OTUs unique to the SW group.

The FW vs SW fish specificdistributions of LAB and their implications for fish health make this group a prime target for further research.Comparing the microbial profiles and their predicted metagenome helped define the substantial differences in community composition harboured in the FW and SW fish intestines as well as explaining the acquisition of microbes and determinants of their composition.Salinity gradient has been identified previously as an important shaper of microbial communities and accounts for a number of community differences of bacterioplankton in FW and SW-.

Metastats analysis identified a higher number of Operational Taxonomic Units OTUs unique to FW compared to SW with an additional 238 OTUs found at significantly different abundance.

SW unique phyla were identified as Fibrobacteres Nitrospira and Thermatogae however these were at very low relative abundances with eight two and twelve sequences identified respectively.Microbial communities of the FW fish contained on average 359 - 37 OTUs whereas SW fish harboured an average of 275 - 24 OTUs.

We identified 716 OTUs unique to the FW group Supplementary Table  and 215 OTUs unique to the SW group Supplementary Table .

This is also reflected in the higher diversity of unique Lactobacillus OTUs in the SW group and a higher diversity of LAB OTUs overall in the FW group identified by Metastats analysis.

A OTUs found uniquely in either the freshwater group Total  716 OTUs or the seawater group Total  215 OTUs summarised by phylum and given aspercentage of the absolute OTU number.
