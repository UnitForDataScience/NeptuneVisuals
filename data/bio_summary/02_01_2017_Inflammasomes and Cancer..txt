in contrast withprevious studies showing that mice lacking il-18 are susceptible to dss-induced intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis 91617 a study has found that mice with a conditional deletion of il-18 in either epithelial cells or hematopoietic cells were more resistant to dss- induced colitis compared with cohoused wild-type mice indicating an il-18-dependent function in both enterocytes and hematopoietic cells 18. under cohousing conditions whereby mice harbor a similar microbiota profile il-18 might inhibit goblet cell maturation prior to the onset of colitis to drive pathology 18. however injection of recombinant il-18 into mice lacking inflammasome components reduces the prevalence of tumors in responsekarki et al.page 3to aom and dss 9 suggesting that this inflammasome-associated cytokine could be considered a potential candidate in immunotherapy against certain cases of colorectal cancer.nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated secretion of il-18 can also induce tumoricidal activity of nk cells against metastasized colonic tumor cells in the mouse liver 19. in addition il-18 promotes downregulation of the soluble il-22 receptor il-22 binding protein 20 fig.

nlrp3 activity is associated with increased lung metastasis when mice were injected intravenously but not subcutaneously with b16-f10 melanoma cells or rm-1 prostate carcinoma cells 2337. in this case mice lacking nlrp3 have a substantially reduced number of lung metastases compared with wild-type mice whereas mice lacking caspase-1 and caspase-11 or il-1r have a similar number of lung metastases compared with wild-type mice 23. the negative effect of nlrp3 is also observed when mice are vaccinated with wild-type dendritic cells pulsed with b16-f10 melanoma cell lysates prior to injection with b16-f10 melanoma such that a greater proportion of vaccinated mice lacking nlrp3 survived compared with that of vaccinated wild-type micekarki et al.page 537. the deleterious effect of nlrp3 in the melanoma model is owing to its ability to suppress activation of nk cells that secrete ifn-g and kill tumor cells 23 fig.

1b.the relationship between il-1r signaling and mdscs in cancer is further demonstrated in a study showing that activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome by chemotherapeutic agents gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil leads to il-1b production in mdscs 42. production ofil-1b by mdscs induces secretion of il-17 by cd4 t cells and dampens the anti-tumorefficacy of gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil 42. the il-1b-il-1r signaling axis activated by the nlrp3 inflammasome has an adverse role in methylcholanthrene mca-induced fibrosarcomas 23. in this case il-1b suppresses the tumoricidal activity of nk cells and t cells 23. moreover il-1b produced as a result of activation of the nlrc4 inflammasome mediates expression of adipocyte-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor a and angiogenesis which accelerates the progression of breast cancer 43. furthermore gain-of- function mutations in the gene encoding nlrp1 induce spontaneous inflammasome activation and il-1 production and drives epidermal hyperplasia in humans 6 fig.

in this review we explore the crossroads between inflammasomes and the development of various tumors and discuss possible therapeutic values in targeting the inflammasome for the prevention and treatment of cancer.keywordsaim2 carcinogens caspase-1 caspase-11 inflammasomes il-1b il-1r il-18 il-18r nlrp1 nlrp3 nlrc4 nlrp6 non-canonical inflammasomes pyroptosis therapy tumorsintroductioninflammation triggered by microbial or danger signals drive many forms of cancer in humans 1. inflammation associated with tumor development is triggered by a variety of immune cells including macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells natural killer nk cells and t and b lymphocytes 2. a central mechanism driving inflammation in immune cells is orchestrated by the inflammasome a cytoplasmic multimeric protein complex that provides a molecular platform for activation of the cysteine protease caspase-1 3. activatedcaspase-1 mediates proteolytic cleavage and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1b and il-18 and initiates an inflammatory form of programed cell death known as pyroptosis 3.correspondence to thirumala-devi kanneganti department of immunology st. jude children's research hospital ms 351 262 danny thomas place memphis tn 38105-3678 tel 901 595-3634 fax.

in the context of cancer polymorphisms in the gene encoding nlrp1 are linked to mesothelioma 4 melanoma 5 and epidermal hyperplasia 6 those of nlrp3 are associated with melanoma5 and colorectal cancer 7 and those of aim2 with colorectal cancer 8. furthermore our contemporary appreciation of the functional importance of inflammasomes in cancer is illuminated by mouse models.

il-1b is involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous gastric cancer or helicobacter felis-induced gastric cancer 40. a transgenic mouse strain engineered to overexpress human il-1b in the stomach is prone to developing gastric cancer due to increased mobilization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells mdscs to the stomach 40. a deleterious role of il-1 signaling is also supported by the finding that mice lacking il-1r have a delayed accumulation of mdscs and reduced primary and metastatic mammary tumors 41 suggesting that inflammation driven by the il-1r signaling pathway is detrimental fig.

the complex and diametric roles ofkarki et al.page 6inflammasome components in different forms of cancer suggest that anti-cancer therapies must be tailor to the specific cancer type and stage of disease.conclusionsin this review we provided a brief overview of the biological importance of inflammasomes in different forms of cancer.

1b.the inflammasome adaptor protein asc also appears to have multiple biological activities that affect the outcome of tumorigenesis 38. a knockdown of the gene encoding asc increases the viability and growth of primary melanoma cells whereas it reduces the viability and growth of metastatic melanoma cells when these cells were injected into nude mice 38. using cell-type-specific knockout mouse strains lacking asc in a chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis model asc was found to limit keratinocyte proliferation and tumor formation whereas it promotes inflammation in infiltrating myeloid cells and the development of tumors 39 fig.

controlled production of the il-22 binding protein fine-tunes the biological activity ofil-22 a cytokine which exerts protective effects against intestinal damage at the peak of inflammation and promotes tumor development at later stages 20. il-22 also maintains il-18 expression in epithelial cells of the ileum whereas il-18 itself is required for il-22 expression in cd4 t cells and innate lymphoid cells 21.the diametric roles of il-18 have also been observed in lung metastasis.

the naip proteins and tlr5 both recognize flagellin of certain bacteria 3. enforced expression of flagellin in tumor cell lines ensuring dual recognition by naip proteins and tlr5 inducestumor cell clearance by innate immune cells and activation of tumor-specific cd4 andcd8 t-cell responses in mice 33. these findings suggest that recognition of tumor cells by the inflammasome and other innate immune sensors could lead to desirable outcomes.the role of nlrc4 itself in a mouse model of aom-dss-induced tumorigenesis is unclear a study suggests that nlrc4 prevents colorectal tumorigenesis by inhibiting cellular proliferation and driving cell death 14 whereas another found no role for nlrc4 10.nlrc4 can also amplify inflammatory signaling pathways in macrophages independently of inflammasome assembly and potentiates production of ifn-g in cd4 and cd8 t cells to dampen melanoma tumor growth in mice 34.in addition to nlrs the dna-sensing inflammasome sensor aim2 can inhibit aom-dss- induced and spontaneous colorectal tumorigenesis via an inflammasome-independent mechanism 3536 fig.

nlrp6 hasbeen proposed to activate caspase-1 and drive il-18 production in the intestine in response to aom and dss treatment 26-28. the nlrp6-il-18 signaling axis prevents the colonization of pro-colitogenic bacterial species tm7 and those of the prevotellaceae family 27. furthermore nlrp6 is essential for muc2 secretion by goblet cells to clear potentially colitogenic bacteria 2931. nlrp6-dependent secretion of muc2 in the intestinal epithelium have been shown to be dependent and independent of the inflammasome 2931 an observation which could be attributed to differences in the gut microbiota and the mouse facilities housing the animals.karki et al.page 4the ability of inflammasome sensors to provide protection against cancer does not always rely on the effector functions of caspase-1 and the cytokines processed by inflammasomes fig.
