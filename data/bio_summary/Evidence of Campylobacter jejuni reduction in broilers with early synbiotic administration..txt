post-hoc analysis showed that grpc mean was different p  0.01 compared to the other groups and in particular its counts were significantly lower at st1 and st4 compared to grpa p  0.014 and p  0.01 respectively.the same trend was observed in c. jejuni data and b in which statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference among groups kruskal-wallis test p  0.01. also in this case the post-hoc test evidenced the grpc as the group with an average count signifi- cantly lower compared to grpa and grpb p  0.01. grpa and grpb counts were stable over time with a slight but not significant decrease at st4 while c. jejuni count at st1 in grpc showed a significant reductionfig.

the administered probiotic strain pcb133 was detected in both grpb and grpc with values in the range 4.7-6.6 log cfug revealing a significant decrease in grpc over time.dgge analysisbased on qpcr results a pcr-dgge analysis was carried out to compare the microbial community profile of the caecal content of broilers belonging to group grpa and grpc at st1 and st4 where quantification analysis highlighted the most interesting results.

profiles of the bacterial communities in the treated group grpc and the dna sequences of excised bands are shown in .a clear separation was observed between grpa and grpc similar- ity  10. st1 and st4 within the treated group gprc fell into two separate clusters similarity  28.4 whereas grpa profiles at st1 and st4 were not completely separated and shared 40.39 similarity.

however all groups showed a decrease at st4 which is significant in grpb and grpc p  0.05 compared to their respective starting value st1.real-time pcr quantificationquantification results of campylobacter spp.

1-day old chicks were infected with c. jejuni strain m1 105 cells and the synbiotic mixture was then administered starting from the first and the 14th day of chicken life for animal groups grpc and grpb respectively.

moreover the samples of the control group grpa and grpc were analysed with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr-dgge to compare the caecal microbial community profiles at the beginning and at the end of the trial.

the three groups of forty animals were named and managed as follows 1 grpa - chickens fed ad libitum with conventional feed 2 grpb - chickens fed ad libitum with conventional feed supplemented with the synbiotic product from the 14th day of life 3 grpc - chickens fed ad libitum with conventional feed supplemented with the synbiotic product starting from the first day of life.

b. longum was carried out on dna extracted from caecal content of ten animals belonging to grpa grpb and grpc at sampling times st1 st2 st3 and st4.

quantification showed a significant difference p  0.01 among groups and pair-wise compar- isons evidenced that bifidobacteria counts were significantly higher in the control group and grpc compared to grpb p  0.01. no significant intra-group variability among sampling times could be observed.

the species richness was significantly p  0.05 lower in grpc compared to grpa at st1 0.5 - 0.1 and 0.5 - 0.1 respectively whereas no significant difference was found at st4 0.7 - 0.1 and- 0.1 respectively.

in the same way the shannon-wiener diversity index and the evenness in grpc 1 - 0.1 0.8 - 0.04 was significantly lower compared to grpa at st1 1.2 - 0.1 0.8 - 0.04 p  0.05 whereas no significant differences were observed at st4 shannon-wiener 1.3 - 0.1 vs 1.3 - 0.1 evenness 0.9 - 0.03- 0.02. the excised bands at the same migration distance of c. jejuni m1 in the ladder  were sequenced and aligned revealing 100 similarity among them.

the counts obtained in all the quantified samples were above the detection limits of both methods 2 log and 3 log cfug for plate counts and qpcr respectively.qpcr also evidenced the detection of pcb133 in all treated animals in agreement with bands identification in the dgge profiles with the highest concentration of the probiotic strain in grpc at st1 associated with the lowest c. jejuni detection.
