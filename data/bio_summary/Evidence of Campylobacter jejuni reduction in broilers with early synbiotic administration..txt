The administered probiotic strain PCB133 was detected in both GrpB and GrpC with values in the range 4.7-6.6 log cfug revealing a significant decrease in GrpC over time.DGGE analysisBased on qPCR results a PCR-DGGE analysis was carried out to compare the microbial community profile of the caecal content of broilers belonging to group GrpA and GrpC at ST1 and ST4 where quantification analysis highlighted the most interesting results.

Profiles of the bacterial communities in the treated group GrpC and the DNA sequences of excised bands are shown in .A clear separation was observed between GrpA and GrpC similar- ity  10.

However all groups showed a decrease at ST4 which is significant in GrpB and GrpC p  0.05 compared to their respective starting value ST1.Real-time PCR quantificationQuantification results of Campylobacter spp.

Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles of GrpA and GrpC at ST1 and ST4.difference between the two tested concentrations data not shown evidenced that the probiotic growth was comparable to glucose.qPCR results targeting Campylobacter spp.

1-day old chicks were infected with C. jejuni strain M1 105 cells and the synbiotic mixture was then administered starting from the first and the 14th day of chicken life for animal groups GrpC and GrpB respectively.

Moreover the samples of the control group GrpA and GrpC were analysed with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis PCR-DGGE to compare the caecal microbial community profiles at the beginning and at the end of the trial.

The three groups of forty animals were named and managed as follows 1 GrpA - chickens fed ad libitum with conventional feed 2 GrpB - chickens fed ad libitum with conventional feed supplemented with the synbiotic product from the 14th day of life 3 GrpC - chickens fed ad libitum with conventional feed supplemented with the synbiotic product starting from the first day of life.

GrpA control group GrpB group supplemented with the synbiotic product starting from the 14th day-of- life GrpC group lifelong supplemented with the synbiotic product.Campylobacter spp.C.
