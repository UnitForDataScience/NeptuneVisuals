Farnesoid X receptor FXR is the most studied bile acid nuclear receptor and is efficiently activated by chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA and cholic acid CA.

In line with the minor changes in bile acid levels we found similar expression of the bile acid synthetic genes involved in the classical neutral and alternative acidic pathways of bile acid synthesis Cyp7a1 Cyp8b1 Cyp27a1 and Cyp7b1 in Cyp3a KO and wild-type control mice A-D which is also reflected by similar hepatic C4 levels .

Bile acid composition in liver gallbladder caecum and serum from Cyp3a knock out mice and wild-type littermate controls was analyzed with UPLC-MSMS and revealed no major differences in bile acid composition.

Specifically besides different preferences in the formation of glycine or taurine conjugates mice synthesize alpha- and betamuricholic acids abMCA in addition to chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid CDCA and CA which are the primary bile acids found in humans.

Another possible pathway for bMCA formation could be 6b-hydroxylation of ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA which is the 7b-isomer of CDCA and a primary bile acid in mice .

Analysis of Cyp3a11 gene expression in liver showed that Cyp3a11 was absent verifying that Cyp3a11 was success- fully deleted in the Cyp3a KO mice D.To determine if deletion of the Cyp3a gene cluster would affect bile acid composition we analyzed bile acid levels in liver gallbladder caecum and serum from portal and caval veins.

This together with our previous findings that UDCA is a primary bile acid in mice and can be produced in the absence of bacteria suggests that UDC A might be formed by an alternative pathway in the mouse liver .In the future Cyp2c70 KO mice may become an attractive huma- nized animal model for studies of bile acid-regulated metabolism and it would be important to investigate if germ-free Cyp2c70 KO mice also lack the murine bile acids and have a human bile acid profile.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing financial interests of relevance for this manuscript.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Antonio Molinaro for isolation of primary hepatocytes Anna Hallen for excellent technical assistance and Zakarias Gulic for superb mouse husbandry.
