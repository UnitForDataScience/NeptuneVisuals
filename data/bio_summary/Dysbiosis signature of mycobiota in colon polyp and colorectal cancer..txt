LEfSe analysis identified the different abundant fungi in the C P and N groups respectively at various taxonomic levels d and key contributors to the clinical phenotypes in the C P and N groups eLasiosphaeriaceaeunidentified Sordarialesunidentified1 and Microascales were increased whereas Pleosporaceae and Alternaria were decreased in late-stage CRC.Association networks of mycobiota in the CRC polyp and control groupsTo determine the relationships between different fungi Spearman correlation was used coefficient threshold  0.6.

Little evidence has been proposed that relies on a high-throughput platform to explore the role of fungi in diseases such as polyps and CRC.In this study we showed for the first time that fecal sam- ples from CRC and polyp patients contain different species of fungi.

We observed fungal dysbiosis in colon polyps and CRC including decreased diversity in polyp patients an increased AscomycotaBasidiomycota ratio and an increased proportion of opportunistic fungi Trichosporon and Malassezia which might favor the progression of CRC.

The mycobiota or fungi is also a crucial component of this gut ecosystem.Only 2 of the microorganisms in the gut are fungi.

S2c d e. The Simpson index showed no difference between the CRC and polyp groups or between the CRC and control groups however we observed a lower Simpson index in the control group than in the polyp group adjusted p 0.03 Fig.

a.Gut mycobiota composition in the CRC polyp and control groupsThe gut mycobiota composition in the CRC polyp and con- trol groups were unique Fig.

Those unidentified fungi were enriched in the control group compared to the CRC and polyp groups.

e.Gut mycobiota structures in the CRC and polyp groupsTo determine whether the CRC and polyp groups had specific gut mycobiota signatures we explored the shift in abundances at various taxonomic levels.

b. Seventeen fungi were enriched in the polyp group while two dominated the control group Fig.

None of the fungi showed a statistically different abundance between the CRC and polyp groups.Mycobiota in various tumor sites and TNM stagesClinical studies have shown that proximal and distal CRC have distinguishing patterns .
