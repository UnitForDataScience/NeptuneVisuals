LEfSe analysis identified the different abundant fungi in the C P and N groups respectively at various taxonomic levels d and key contributors to the clinical phenotypes in the C P and N groups eLasiosphaeriaceaeunidentified Sordarialesunidentified1 and Microascales were increased whereas Pleosporaceae and Alternaria were decreased in late-stage CRC.Association networks of mycobiota in the CRC polyp and control groupsTo determine the relationships between different fungi Spearman correlation was used coefficient threshold  0.6.

Little evidence has been proposed that relies on a high-throughput platform to explore the role of fungi in diseases such as polyps and CRC.In this study we showed for the first time that fecal sam- ples from CRC and polyp patients contain different species of fungi.
