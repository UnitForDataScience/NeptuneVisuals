Such data are likely to play an ever larger role in informing environmental and public health policy decisions in the future decisions in which each person has a stake.Metagenomics studies generate large sequence data files they have become a prototypical example of big data and analysis of these data often requires sophisticated software and considerable computational resources.

While the students do not generate new data they do work with data that have been generated in collaboration with the public and they do generate novel results given those data.

While development of advanced data analysis and technical laboratory skills is valuable neither is critical to understand the conceptual basis of metagenomics which we view as the first step to using metagenomics as a tool.Here we describe an activity Unique Down to Our Microbes... that provides an opportunity for students to work with metagenomics data and explore the bacterial communities that live on our bodies even if they do not have access to sophisticated software or wet lab resources.

Instructions for loading the data file are provided on page 5 of the Student Handout Appendix 1.The second component of this activity requires students to develop a hypothesis to test with the given data set and available metadata.

In this inquiry- based activity designed for introductory life science majors and nonmajors students perform an investigation of the bacterial communities inhabiting the human belly button and associated metagenomics data collected through a citizen science project and visualized using an open-access bioinformatics tool.

The activity is designed for attainment of the following student learning outcomes defining terms associated with metagenomics analyses describing the biological impact of the microbiota on human health formulating a hypothesis analyzing and interpreting metagenomics data to compare microbiota evaluating a specific hypothesis and synthesizing a conceptual model as to why bacterial populations vary.

In presentations students demonstrated their ability to develop novel hypotheses and analyze and interpret metagenomic data to evaluate their hypothesis.

By integrating metagenomics into introductory biology class- rooms we can prepare both students with future careers in biology and the larger group of students who will not become biologists but nonetheless need to appreciate and understand complex data like those used in metagenomics studies and the science surrounding them.

Students use an open-source web browser-based bioin- formatics tool Phinch.org to visualize and interact with microbiome data from a citizen-science project that sam- pled over 270 belly buttons to investigate their microbial biodiversity 10.

In addition the citizen science-collected belly button case example includes additional resources that students can engage by visiting the Your Wild Life website These resources include images of the microbes that grew from the same samples for which metagenomic data are available the stories of the scientists and the ways in which other sci- entists have built upon the initial results of the first belly button biodiversity study.
