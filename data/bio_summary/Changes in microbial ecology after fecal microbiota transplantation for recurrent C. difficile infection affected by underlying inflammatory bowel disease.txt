similarly a recent study that evaluated pre- and post- fmt for recurrent cdi gut microbiome samples from a subset of patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial  compared donor fmt to autologous fmt sug- gested that complete engraftment of donor bacteria may be not necessary if functionally critical taxa are present in subjects following initial antibiotic therapy for cdi this study excluded patients with ibd but was able to compare autologous to donor fmt unlike our study.

the underlying host or donor factors that may be important for success of fmt in treatment of ibd remain unclear.in this study we assessed the effect of donor type standard donor versus related donor and changes in gut microbial ecology on response to fmt in recurrent cdi with and without underlying ibd as well as clinical response to fmt.methodspatient selectionpatients undergoing fmt for recurrent cdi were pro- spectively recruited in this study.

among patients with ibd at the time of colonoscopy 2 had normal colonoscopy 1 had pseudopolyps 5 had se- vere pancolitis 1 had moderate colitis 1 had mild colitis 1 had mild procto-sigmoiditis and 1 had moderate ileo- colitis additional file table s1.all patients responded to fmt with regards to clinical or microbiologic remission of cdi negative c. difficile testing in the presence of ongoing diarrhea 92.1 n  35 of patient symptoms returned to baseline bowel pattern as before cdi and resolution of cdi 5.3 n  2 both with ibd had worsening diarrhea c. difficile nega- tive and 2.6 n  1 had new onset constipation after fmt.

compared to cdi patients without ibd cdi patients with ibd have higher proportion of the original microbial communities after fmt and increased episodes of future cdi on long-term follow-up.additional filescompeting intereststhe authors declare that they have no competing interests.authors' contributionssk yv-b rkdp and pk was responsible for the design of the study obtained funding acquisition of data analysis and interpretation of data draft of the manuscript and critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content.

this lack of beneficial change in microbial ecology may be relevant for long-term response of cdi in pa- tients with ibd and the lack of clinical response of ibd to fmt seen in our and previous studies future studies designed to study the effect of compositional andfunctional changes in gut microbiota on clinical outcomes following fmt in patients with ibd will be needed to de- finitively address the potential importance of changes in microbial ecology donor selection  underlying disease characteristics and multiple-dose fmts in correcting the underlying pathophysiology of ibd.conclusionsthere is a significant increase in microbial diversity in patients with recurrent cdi after fmt.

interest- ingly in this cohort all patients had an initial clinical or microbiological remission negative c. difficile testing in the presence of ongoing diarrhea of cdi following fmt and we did not see a difference in initial response reported in a recent study  which is also likely due to the smaller sample size of our study and differences in underlying dis- ease characteristics.we also did not see changes in need for ibd therapy in the subset of patients with ibd underlying cdi.

a diverse gut microbial community confers colonization resistance against pathogens such as c. diffi- cile and disruption of a diverse community structure from antibiotics comorbidities altered gastrointestinal transit or other risk factors can lead to pathogen colonization and infection .with increasing incidence of community and hospital acquired cdi high rates of recurrent cdi estimated 20-30 after a first and 50-60 after a third infection high mortality 29000 deaths annually in the usa and an urgent need for newer non-antibiotic therapies has led to the emergence of microbiome-based therapies fecal microbiota transplantation fmt in cdi patients restores phylogenetic diversity to levels more typical of a healthy person with response rates 85 by enema oral capsule or endoscopic delivery modes -.

furthermore as all patients had ongoing clinical remission with microbiological re- sponse if measured donor type does not appear to affect cdi-related clinical response.change in bacterial diversity after fmt is dependent on underlying ibdibd disease course as measured by the need for specific ibd therapies did not change after fmt and patients with cdi and underlying ibd retained a higher proportion of the pre-transplant communities and lower proportion of new communities following fmt.

a linear regression of phylogenetic diversity ver- sus md index additional file figure s3 shows a sig- nificantly lower negative correlation between the increase in phylogenetic diversity and the increase of the md index in patients with ibd pearson's correlation coefficient ibd r  -0.68 no ibd r  -0.83 p  0.0001 additional file figure s3 suggesting a lack of recovery of phylogenetic di- versity in patients with ibd as the md index improves.discussionin this study we found that gut microbiota diversity changes rapidly following fmt for treatment of cdi and resembles donor microbiota diversity similar to previous studies.

as the communities change post-fmt the distance to this plane is reduced.clinical response of cdi to fmt is independent of engraftment or donor type but underlying ibd influences changes in gut microbial ecology after fmtin order to determine if the response of cdi to fmt was dependent on donor stool engraftment we determined spearman's correlation coefficient between fecal microbial communities prior to 7 and 28 days post-transplant.

the risk of another episode of cdi after fmt in ibd patients was 25 n  312 compared to 7.7 n  226 in non-ibd patients p  0.16 chi-square test.

there was a higher number of recurrent cdi followingfmt in patients with cdi and ibd but this was not sta- tistically significant likely given the small sample size.

d ancom p  0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using bonferroni- holm's method .all patients had either clinical or microbiological re-mission negative c. difficile testing in the presence of ongoing diarrhea confirming that initial response of cdi to fmt is not dependent on the degree of donor stool engraftment.
