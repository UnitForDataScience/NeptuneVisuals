we also used glms to determine the relationship be- tween bacterial diversity and log bd infection intensity in tadpoles and adults measure of resistance corticosterone release rates in tadpoles and bacterial diversity of tadpoles and adults and bacterial diversity of tadpoles and bacterial diversity of adults.

we also hypothesize that the effects of atrazine on microbiota are mediated by corticosterone figure 1 paths a-f. if so then the effect of atrazine on microbiota should be counteracted by the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone.2  materials and methods  tadpole collection and husbandrywe collected multiple clutches of tadpoles of osteopilus septentriona- lis in august 2014 from the botanical gardens of the university ofcharacterized gut bacteriabmanipulated water treatmentachanged waterbmetamorphoseddexposed to bd equantified bd f----characterized gut bacteriagquantified corticosteroneb----exposed to bd bquantified bd cfigure 2 methods to determine the relationships among atrazine exposure corticosterone levels host-associated gut microbiota and bd infection risk in cuban tree frogs.

one example of a non-target effect of metyrapone is that it can decrease aldosterone production tucci espiner jagger  lauler 1967 which is a hormone responsible for the reabsorption of sodium and water reabsorption in the gut and the regulation of extracellular potassium and blood pressure randall burggren  french 2002. in turn these physiological changes may be responsible for the increase in gut bacterial diversity of adults in response to metyrapone but this hypothesis requires further investigation.host-associated microbiota do not appear to have a direct effect or mediate the effect of atrazine or corticosterone on host tolerance against bd figure 1 paths c-e a-f-e. instead the effect of atrazine on host tolerance of bd is likely caused by direct effects of atrazine such as energy lost to atrazine detoxification or repair from damage caused by atrazine figure 1 paths a-b nieves-puigdoller bjornsson  mccormick 2007. alternatively these effects could be from indi- rect effects of atrazine on unmeasured hormones such as thyroxine.
