the filled squares represent the studies in relation to their weights.subgroup analyses of the cohort studies table a6 showed that route of administration might play a significant role in clini- cal remission among uc patients as the pooled proportion of uc patients receiving upper gastrointestinal infusions was 17 95 ci  8-32 cochran's q p  0.604 i2  0 whereas the pooled proportion of uc patients receiving lower gastrointestinal infusions was 36 95 ci  24-50 cochran's q p  0.004 i2  57.further subgroup analyses by number of infusions showed that the pooled proportion of uc patients receiving a high number of infu- sions  10 infusions that achieved clinical remission was 49 95 ci  21-77 cochran's q p  0.246 i2  29 which was considerably higher than in those uc patients who received  10 infusions pooled proportion  27 95 ci  17-40 cochran's q p  0.001 i2  58. although the pooled proportion of uc patients receiving fresh infusions that achieved clinical remission 28 95 ci  15-46 cochran's q p  0.001 i2  63 wasless than with frozen infusions 36 95 ci  13-67 cochran's q p  0.045 i2  63 this was likely confounded by associa- tion with an increased number of infusions.

an ear- lier meta-analysis assessing only uc cohort studies identified 79 patients with a pooled proportion achieving clinical remission of 22 95 ci  10.4-40.8. the current meta-analysis identi- fied 24 uc cohort studies assessing 307 patients with a pooled pro- portion of patients that achieved clinical remission of 33 95 ci 23-43. furthermore four rcts reporting on 140 fmt-treated uc patients were analysed.

this along with subgroup analyses of the uc cohort studies suggests that multiple infusions and pos- sibly lower gastrointestinal administration increases the likelihood of remission in uc patients treated with fmt though the precise number required varied substantially between studies remains to be defined and likely is donor-and recipient-dependent.regarding the role of fmt in cd the pooled proportion of patients that achieved clinical remission presented in the current meta-analysis 52 is slightly lower than the figure reported in the previous meta-analysis pooled proportion  60.5 95 ci  28.4-85.6. as previously highlighted by these authors however the cd results should be interpreted with caution as the confidence intervals remain wide and the pooled effect size may be inflated due to the variability of methodology among individual studies and the still limited data.

all significant results obtained through the meta-analyses remained significant in sensitivity analy- ses inferring statistical robustness.ulcerative colitisa total of 41 studies were identified assessing fmt in uc nine case reports five case series 24 prospective cohort studies 20 uncontrolled four controlled and four rcts reporting on 555 uc patients .overall 36 201555 of uc patients achieved clinical remis- sion during follow-up.

there were six cohort studies assessing 34 patients in paediatric uc and only two cohort studies assessing 13 patients in paediatric cd.

further the pooled proportion of uc patients who received an antibiotic course before fmt and achieved clinical remission was 33 95 ci  17-54 cochran's q p  0.026 i2  58 whereas the proportion in uc patients who did not receive an antibiotic course pre-fmt was 28 95 ci  16-44 cochran's q p  0.002 i2  61. the rel-evance of the other subgroup analyses findings is uncertain given the small number of studies and patients.
