The filled squares represent the studies in relation to their weights.Subgroup analyses of the cohort studies Table A6 showed that route of administration might play a significant role in clini- cal remission among UC patients as the pooled proportion of UC patients receiving upper gastrointestinal infusions was 17 95 CI  8-32 Cochran's Q p  0.604 I2  0 whereas the pooled proportion of UC patients receiving lower gastrointestinal infusions was 36 95 CI  24-50 Cochran's Q p  0.004 I2  57.Further subgroup analyses by number of infusions showed that the pooled proportion of UC patients receiving a high number of infu- sions  10 infusions that achieved clinical remission was 49 95 CI  21-77 Cochran's Q p  0.246 I2  29 which was considerably higher than in those UC patients who received  10 infusions pooled proportion  27 95 CI  17-40 Cochran's Q p  0.001 I2  58.

All significant results obtained through the meta-analyses remained significant in sensitivity analy- ses inferring statistical robustness.Ulcerative colitisA total of 41 studies were identified assessing FMT in UC nine case reports five case series 24 prospective cohort studies 20 uncontrolled four controlled and four RCTs reporting on 555 UC patients .Overall 36 201555 of UC patients achieved clinical remis- sion during follow-up.

There were six cohort studies assessing 34 patients in paediatric UC and only two cohort studies assessing 13 patients in paediatric CD.

This along with subgroup analyses of the UC cohort studies suggests that multiple infusions and pos- sibly lower gastrointestinal administration increases the likelihood of remission in UC patients treated with FMT though the precise number required varied substantially between studies remains to be defined and likely is donor-and recipient-dependent.Regarding the role of FMT in CD the pooled proportion of patients that achieved clinical remission presented in the current meta-analysis 52 is slightly lower than the figure reported in the previous meta-analysis pooled proportion  60.5 95 CI  28.4-85.6.

This included 41 articles or abstracts assessing FMT in UC and reporting on 555 UC patients 11 in CD reporting on 83 CD patients and four in pouchitis reporting on 23 patients.Study qualityThe methodological quality of the included cohort studies and RCTs are outlined in the Appendix Tables A2 A3 available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online.

The pooled proportion of patients that achieved clinical response was 52 95 CI  40-64 in a meta-analysis that included234 individuals from 20 cohort studies Figure A1 available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online a moderate level of het- erogeneity Cochran's Q p  0.001 I2  58 and no publication bias was observed in this meta-analysis Table A5.Meta-analysis including four RCTs of FMT in UC  which comprised a total of 140 FMT-treated individuals showed that FMT was significantly associated with clinical remission in these patients P-OR  2.89 95 CI  1.36-6.13 p  0.006.

A signifi- cant association was also found between FMT and clinical response in UC patients P-OR  2.48 95 CI  1.18-5.21 p  0.016 FigureA2 available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online with a moderate level of heterogeneity Cochran's Q p  0.102 I2  52 and no publication bias Table A5.Interestingly sensitivity analyses showed that on removal of the RCT by Rossen et al.which in contrast to the other studies used only two infusions and administered them via an upper gastrointestinal infusion the association between FMT and clinical remission in UC patients was highly significant P-OR of 4.05 95 CI  2.08-7.89 p   0.001 Cochran's Q p  0.783 I2  0 Figure A3 available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online.

The current meta-analysis identi- fied 24 UC cohort studies assessing 307 patients with a pooled pro- portion of patients that achieved clinical remission of 33 95 CI 23-43.

In the only study that allowed for multiple FMT infusions 45 patients achieved clinical remission with the other patient achieving clinical response.We did not perform a pouchitis meta-analysis as only three small cohort studies were identified which had differing end- points and conflicting outcomes.Endoscopic dataSpecific endoscopic outcomes were reported in the four RCTs and six of the 24 cohort studies of FMT in UC .
