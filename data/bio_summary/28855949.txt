AMPP are critical for the maintenance of the intestinal barrier and the immunological homeostasis of the GIT.We used aged and young C57BL6 mice 104 and 20 weeks average age respectively as a model to investi- gate changes in the baseline synthesis of ileal AMPP in old age.

The functional consequences of these changes are unclear and require further study.Our findings show that the homeostatic expression of AMPP is altered in the aged ileum.

The secretory granules of Paneth cells appeared larger and very prominent in aged mice Fig.
