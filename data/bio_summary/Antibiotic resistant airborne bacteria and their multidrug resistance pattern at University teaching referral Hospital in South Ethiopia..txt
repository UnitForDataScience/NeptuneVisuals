aureus were the predominant bacterial isolates in all setups in this study which could be associated with their ability to persist and resist the harsh environmental con- dition and to suspend in the air particles .

Though isolates were not identi- fied from patients in this study the role of contaminated indoor air could be pathogenic if contact is established with patients it is pertinent that their presence should be controlled.AbbreviationsDR delivery room ICU intensive care unit MDR multi drug resistant OT operation theatre TMP-SXT trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole WSUTRH Wolaita Sodo University teaching referral Hospital.Authors' contributionsFS Conceived the study FS AR YA and FW Participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis FS FW Interpreted the data FS Obtained ethical clearance and permission for study FW Supervised data collectors FS FW Drafting the article or revisiting it critically for important intellectual content.

The air samples were collected in a day considering the most representative hours at 8-9 AM at 11 AM-12 PM 4-5 PM after a preliminary survey by consider- ing the fact that a higher patient staff and attendee load could become the highest burden for acquiring infection through air way.

High level of airborne bacteria in the hospital is an alarming call since these settings are places where actual surgical procedures severely sick and post-surgical reha- bilitated patients are admitted and delivery services are handled.Antibiotic resistant infections add considerable and avoidable costs to the health care system of which it adds 20 billion USD in excess direct health care cost with addi- tional costs to low society of productivity as high as 35 billion USD .Thirty-nine percent of MRSA prevalence in the current study is higher than 26.6  18.1  and 7.7  reported in Ethiopia which could be explained by differ- ence in sampling site where most of the resistant isolates in the current study were identified in the intensive care unit where repeated exposure to antibiotics is admin- istered.

This could be due to the use of active air sampling in Taiwan hospital and difference in ward and number of patients attended in reference to Khartoum hospital as compared and E. coli is one of the commonest causes of urinary tract infections 35 prevalence in the study set- ting where E. coli accounts 31.4 and is commonly pre- sent in appendix abscess peritonitis cholecystitis septic wounds and bedsores bacteraemia and endotoxic shock particularly in surgical or otherwise debilitated patients .Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence 5.3 in this study is relatively comparable with other similar study in North Ethiopia  but much less than 28  and 52  reported previously which could be due to thedifference in methodology sampling place or magnitude of nosocomial infection in specific localities.

Effective and new antibiotics like ceftazidime and imi- penem resistance for the study area in the hospital air could be projected to the patients and could pose major problem for antibiotic stewardship programs.

S. aureus isolates depicted 87.5 resistance to chloram- phenicol and 28 38.9 were MRSA isolates.

Eight isolates in this study were vancomycin-resistant Enterococci VRE.Gram-negative bacterial isolates showed resistance ranging from 15.4-87 of which Acinetobacter spp.

accounts 82.5 MDR prevalence of which three isolates were pan-resistant and seven isolates were resistant for three antibiotics chloramphenicol  gentamicin  tri- methoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

were MDR with two pan-resistant isolates and 84.6 of the isolates four pan-resistances were MDR.
