It is present in the intestine at relativelylow abundance however it can act as a pathobiont by causing diarrhea and has been associated-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Figure 2The role of prokaryotic microbes in cancer initiation and progression.

New evidence that the composition of the gut microbiota modulates the response to immunother- apy opens new possibilities of improving outcomes 53 205 206.An early study showed that in mice preconditioned with total body irradiation TBI before receiving adoptive T cell therapy the antitumor effect was dependent on the presence of gut-------------------------------------------------------------------------Figure 3Gut microbiota in cancer therapy.

More CD8 T cells infiltrated within tumors in JAX mice compared to TAC mice suggesting that the slower tumor growth and better re- sponsiveness to anti-PD-L1 in JAX mice was due to a more robust anticancer immune responseTAC mice cohoused with JAX mice acquired the same rate of tumor growth antitumor resistance and responsiveness to anti-PD-L1 observed in JAX mice 206.

The incidence of keratinocyte cancer and cancer at other barrier surfaces exposed to the microbiota is elevated in immunosuppressed recipients of organ transplants 60 likely owing to changes in the microbiota composition at these sites and defective tumor immunosurveillance.Epidemiological cancer studies based on the analysis of oral fecal and tissue samples to evaluate the role of the microbiota and dysbiosis have mostly been limited to gastrointestinal and lung carcinomata 61.

This article reports that IL-18 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells prevented mucus-forming goblet cells from maturing and mice that were deficient for IL-18 or IL-18R in intestinal epithelial cells and that were cohoused with wild-type mice to equalize the microbiota composition were resistant to DSS-induced colitis 157.In several experimental models SCFAs acting through the GPR109A receptors are anti-inflammatory and decrease incidence of colon and mammary cancer 152 158.

Colonic H. hepaticus infection increases ileal and colonic carcinogenesis in APCmin mice and in AOM-treated Rag2-- mice byinducing IL-22 production by innate lymphoid cells 155 169.

In breast cancer a meta-analysis of five case-control studies showed that antibiotic use was associated with a slightly elevated risk of breast cancer though this association is controversial 83.

Therefore further investigation using experimental models may shed light on the role of the gut microbiota in cancer anorexiacachexia.HUMAN CARCINOGENIC MICROORGANISMSInfection-induced cancer accounts for approximately 16 of the global burden of all human can- cers corresponding to approximately 2 million new cases per year 96.

Direct interactions of bacterial structural components and their metabolites for example hydrogen sulfide and p-cresol with epithelial stromal and hematopoietic cells may have direct genotoxic effects and promote cancer progression 122-126.Mice deficient in genes controlling host-microbe cross talk have been extensively used for studying the mechanisms by which the microbiota affects cancer.
