Larger studies in subjects without GC are needed to further compare the gastric microbiota by different anatomical sites and also control for population and health conditions.Hp colonization may impact gastric microbiota by induction of host antimicrobial peptides Hornsby et al.

Therefore gastric microbiota in GC patients remains largely unknown.Chronic colonization of Hp is the major risk factor for GC in both Chinese and Mexican populations Kamangar et al.

A study in China however suggested that the major influence of Hp on microbiota is the increased bacterial load in the stomach not the relative abundance of non-Hp bacteria groups Wang et al.

Our recent study of the Chinese sample set suggested that the changes in the gastric microbiota including Hp relative abundance in non-malignant tissue were associated with cancer risk factors and clinical outcomes including family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer and tumor grades Yu et al.

2014 did not identify Hp as the dominant species in any of the samples evaluated while four other studies in Korea Taiwan and USA showed results consistent with our finding with Hp as the dominant species in GC samples Dicksved et al.

A recent study of 212 chronic gastritis and 103 GC patients in China that used quantitative PCR showed that the bacteria load in the gastric mucosa was increased in cancer patients compared to gastritis patients and the bacterial load was positively correlated with Hp quantity R  0.38 P  0.001 suggesting Hp colonization in GC patients Wang et al.

Consistent with our findings a study in the United States showed that the relative abundance of non-Hp bacteria in Hp subjects was not altered compared to Hp- subjects when Hp sequences were eliminated from the analysis Bik et al.

As shown in Table 1 the majority of GC patients' stomachs 94 Chinese and 55 Mexican were colonized by Hp and 53 Chinese and 28 Mexican gastric microbiota were dominated by Hp Hp relative abundance50.The virtual reconstructed functional profiles KEGG modules of non-malignant gastric tissue samples predicted by PICRUSt are shown in Figure 1C.

In addition we limited the comparison of HMP and stomach microbiota data to the highest and least variable taxonomic phylumfunctional module level so that the populationtechnology differences between these two studies would have limited effect on the comparisons.Metagenomic PredictionWe used Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States PICRUSt1.0.0 Langille et al.
