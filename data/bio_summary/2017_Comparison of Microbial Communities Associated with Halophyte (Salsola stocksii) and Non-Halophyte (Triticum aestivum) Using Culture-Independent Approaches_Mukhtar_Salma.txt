It was observed that sequences from the class Actinobacteria were more dominant as compared to other bacterial classes Gammaproteobacteria Bacilli Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria from the phyllosphere of S. stocksii while sequences belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria were most abundant in the phyllosphere of wheat followed by Actinobacteria Bacilli Negativicutes Alphaproteobacteria and Beta proteobacteria Table I.Comparison of rhizosphere endosphere and phyllosphere microbiome of S. stocksii and wheat at genus level.

Proteobacteria Actino bacteria and Bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla found in the phyllosphere of grasses and angiosperms sug- gesting that relatively few bacterial phyla colonize the phyllosphere Bodenhausen et al.

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using bacterial universal forward primer FD1 and universal reverse primer rP1 for rhizosphere and phyllosphere samples of S. stocksii Akhtar et al.

Bacterial and archaeal phylotype sequences detected from rhizosphere phyllosphere and endosphere of S. stocksii and wheat.reported from saline environment and contaminated sludge samples Valenzuela-Encinas et al.

Accession numbers for 16S rRNA gene sequences from S. stocksii rhizosphere were HG938313-HG938352 LN827740- LN827750 LN835771-LN835799 Table S4 root endo-sphere LM644099-LM644131 LN555114-LN555147 LN827751-LN827759 LN835800-LN835828 Table S6phyllosphere LN879933-LN880052 Table S8 from wheat rhizosphere LN880053-LN880164 Table S3 root endosphere LN880218-LN880269 Table S5 and phyllosphere LN880165-LN880217 Table S7.Calculation of diversity indices.

Populus Arabidopsisand Zea mays revealed that overall structure of the microbial community may have variations in rhizo- endo- and phyllosphere of same plant Shakya et al.

Actinobacteria iden- tified from phyllosphere have been known as biocontrol agents against fungal plant pathogens Bodenhausen et al.

Meta- genomic techniques indicated that plant host genotype is an important factor structuring bacterial communi- ties in plant leaves roots and rhizosphere Balint et al.

Bacterial endophytes and rhizosphere microbiome may provide the plant with different accessible nutrients such as nitrogen N and phosphorus P Browne et al.

In the present study sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene indicated that 10 bacterial phyla from rhizospheric soil and roots 7 bacterial phyla from phyllosphere and leaves of S. stocksii whereas 7 bacterial phyla were detected from rhizospheric soil and roots 5 bacterial phyla from phyllosphere and leaves of wheat.
