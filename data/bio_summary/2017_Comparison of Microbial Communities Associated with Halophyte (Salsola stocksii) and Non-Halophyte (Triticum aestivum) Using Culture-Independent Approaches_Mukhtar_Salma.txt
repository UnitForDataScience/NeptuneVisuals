2. principal component analysis pca of the rhizosphere root endosphere phyllosphere microbiomes of s. stocksii and wheat.table i. it was observed that sequences from the class actinobacteria were more dominant as compared to other bacterial classes gammaproteobacteria bacilli betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria from the phyllosphere of s. stocksii while sequences belonged to the gammaproteobacteria were most abundant in the phyllosphere of wheat followed by actinobacteria bacilli negativicutes alphaproteobacteria and beta proteobacteria table i.comparison of rhizosphere endosphere and phyllosphere microbiome of s. stocksii and wheat at genus level.

soil moisture con- tent  of s. stocksii and wheat rhizosphere was 28 - 4 and 20 - 3. electrical conductivity dsm of s. stocksii and wheat rhizosphere measured by adviento-borbe method was 4.86 - 0.22 and 3.51 - 0.33. soil samples were alkaline in nature with soil ph of s. stocksii and wheat rhizosphere 8.53 - 0.21 and 7.71 - 0.39. soil temperature of s. stocksii and wheat rhizosphere was23.5 - 3degc and 32.50 - 1.5degc table s1.

in the present study sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene indicated that 10 bacterial phyla from rhizospheric soil and roots 7 bacterial phyla from phyllosphere and leaves of s. stocksii whereas 7 bacterial phyla were detected from rhizospheric soil and roots 5 bacterial phyla from phyllosphere and leaves of wheat.

sequences of the phyla acidobacteria 2 planctomycete 5 and verrucomicrobia 2 were also detected from the root microbiome.phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences indicated that 22 sequences showed homology with uncultured unclassified bacteria 71 sequences with7 bacterial phyla and 7 sequences with archaea from phyllosphere of s. stocksii.

5. bacterial and archaeal phylotype sequences detected from rhizosphere phyllosphere and endosphere of s. stocksii and wheat.reported from saline environment and contaminated sludge samples valenzuela-encinas et al.

from the rhizospheric soil of s. stocksii 30 sequences of 16s rrna gene were unclassified uncultured bacteria 64 sequences showed homol- ogy with 10 bacterial phyla and 6 sequences with euryarchaeota.

2014. proteobacteria actino bacteria and bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla found in the phyllosphere of grasses and angiosperms sug- gesting that relatively few bacterial phyla colonize the phyllosphere bodenhausen et al.

the 16s rrna gene was amplified using bacterial universal forward primer fd1 and universal reverse primer rp1 for rhizosphere and phyllosphere samples of s. stocksii akhtar et al.

accession numbers for 16s rrna gene sequences from s. stocksii rhizosphere were hg938313-hg938352 ln827740- ln827750 ln835771-ln835799 table s4 root endo-sphere lm644099-lm644131 ln555114-ln555147 ln827751-ln827759 ln835800-ln835828 table s6phyllosphere ln879933-ln880052 table s8 from wheat rhizosphere ln880053-ln880164 table s3 root endosphere ln880218-ln880269 table s5 and phyllosphere ln880165-ln880217 table s7.calculation of diversity indices.

similar to rhizosphere microbial community sequences of proteobacteria were the most abundant 36 followed by actinobacteria 26 and firmicutes 12. together bacteroidetes and acidobacteria con- stituted approximately 8 of the total microbial diver- sity in the phyllosphere.principle component analysis pca was used to study potential differences in the microbial communi- ties from the rhizosphere endosphere and phyllosphere of s. stocksii and wheat.

3. phylotype sequences detected from s. stocksii and wheat microbiomes.monly detected from halophyte and non-halophyte while salt tolerant bacterial and archaeal genera halo coccus chromohalobacter rhodothermus desulfurella halomonas and nesterenkonia were identified only in the rhizosphere endosphere and phyllosphere of sal sola and azospirillum aeromonas jatrophihabitans clostridium niastella and paenibacillus were dominant in the microbiome of wheat fig.

4.the results showed that bacterial and archaeal gen- era halococcus halalkalicoccus haloferula chromo halobacter and thermotoga were detected only from the rhizosphere of s. stocksii while bacterial genera arthrobacter burkholderia brevibacillus citrobacter and kribbella were identified from the rhizosphere of wheat fig.

meta- genomic techniques indicated that plant host genotype is an important factor structuring bacterial communi- ties in plant leaves roots and rhizosphere balint et al.

bacterial endophytes and rhizosphere microbiome may provide the plant with different accessible nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p browne et al.
