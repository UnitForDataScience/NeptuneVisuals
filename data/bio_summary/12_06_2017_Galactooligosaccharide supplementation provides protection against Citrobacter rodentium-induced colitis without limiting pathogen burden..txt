Bacterial burdens from C. rodentium-infected mice treated with GOS mice were not significantly different from those of untreated infected mice.

Colonic tis- sues were removed from a uninfected untreated control mice b untreated C. rodentium-infected mice or c GOS-treated C. roden- tium-infected mice and processed for histopathological analysis.

Rep- resentative photomicrographs of hematoxylin and eosin H and E stained liver sections taken at x10 c-e and x40 f-h objective mag- nification with bars denoting lengths of 250 and 100 um respectively at the two magnifications from either uninfected untreated control mice untreated C. rodentium-infected mice or GOS-treated C. rodentium-infected mice.

However GOS-treated C. rodentium-infected mice were protected against such tissue damage and presented with scores simi- lar to those of healthy untreated uninfected mice.
