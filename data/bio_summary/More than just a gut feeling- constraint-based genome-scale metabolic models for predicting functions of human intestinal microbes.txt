this process of using experimental data to find incorrect gem predictions and subsequently making changes to the gem has also been combined into algorithms such as growmatch that will make a minimal number of changes to a gem while maximizing its coherence to experimental data.the established manual gem reconstruction processultimately results in high-quality gems but is extremely time-consuming the advent of high throughput sequencing and concurrent rapid increase in available biological data warrants a faster approach which isprovided by the raven toolbox and the model- seed approach in both cases the process of geno- me annotation draft gem construction and gap-filling has been fully automated although extensive manual curation remains necessary to sustain a high quality this curation process has recently been streamlined for gut microbes specifically as part of the agora metabolic gem resource a distinguishing feature of the agora gem resource is the semi-automatic curation of modelseed gems where corrections that are manually applied to a single gem are propagated to the gems of other gut microbes.

secondly we describe appli- cations of gems for gut microbiome research that enable i selecting minimal and defined growth media for previously cultured as well as not yet cultured gut microbes ii predicting growth and phenotypes of gut microbes and their influence on health and disease andmodeling co-cultures and multispecies interactions of gut microbes and the human host fig.

this binary discretization leads to two different types of inconsistencies i growth predicted by the gem but not experimentally found and ii growth that is experimentally validated but not predicted by the gem.

here we first de- scribe the challenges in the use of gems for the design of defined media and then how gems have been suc- cessfully used for the design of defined media and how similar approaches can be used to design suitable de- fined media for not yet cultured bacteria.there are three main challenges in the use of gemsfor the design of defined growth media i the in silicobiomass composition is an influential aspect of the gem as it defines all metabolites required for growth the omission of even a single metabolite in this compo- sition can prevent the gem from predicting an essential media supplement.

ultimately the researchers were able to design a refined and chemically defined medium cdm3 that faci- litated both in silico and in vitro growth albeit that growth was still rather poor and unreliable the requirement for manual curation of modelseed gems prior to media design has been substantially reduced due to the presence of 773 semi-automatically curated gems of relevant gut microbes  in the agora gem resource .

in vivo or in vitro validation of gem predictions and subsequent gem updates remain key in improving gem quality and ultimately understand- ing the complex gut ecosystem.gems allow understanding why species are present and what they do instead of who they are as was the focus in the last decades.

moreover these predictions were instrumental in the prediction of diets to improve the metabolic function of gut microbiota ulti- mately this research will lead to increased understan- ding of the interactions of the gut microbiota and its host and on its role in gut homeostasis and dysfunc- tion and it will ultimately pave to way to improve human health using specific gut microbes or dietary interventions.conclusion and perspectivesafter a few decades of characterizing gut microbiota composition many gut microbes have been sequenced over 200 of these genome sequences have been used to generate gems in most cases by automated tools these gems have been used to predict growth phenotypes of single microbes and communities in laboratory and in vivo settings.here we reviewed three ways in which gems contri- bute in elucidating gut microbiome function.

therefore the gems of lactic acid bacteria are used to study their metabolic capa- bilities and behavior in fermentation processes  as well as their probiotic functions  the gem of l. plantarum wcfs1 was automatically constructed based on its genome sequence and subsequently exten- sively manually curated  the gem was then used to predict the essentiality of 36 compounds in a chemically defined growth medium.

therefore a gem was usedto design a minimal growth medium for staphylococcus aureus n315 a pathogen that frequently infects hospita- lized patients the gem predicted that several amino acids were essential but in vivo experiments indi- cated otherwise.

a modelseed model thus re- quires manual curation before using it to predict suitable minimal growth media.such a manually curated modelseed gem was recently used for minimal medium design for f. prausnitzii a prevalent and potential beneficial gut microbe that is com- monly grown on the chemically undefined ycfag medium the automatically generated modelseed gem was first manually curated such that it correctly captured the known biochemistry and physiology of f. prausnitzii.

the metabolic model for the pathogenic p. aeruginosa also showed a versatile metabolic pattern and accounted for virulence inducing pathways such as exopolysaccharide alginate synthesis .in more recent research highly quantitative proteo- mics and metabolic measurements were used to impose ph-dependent constraints on the gem of enterococcus faecalis a human gut pathogen the ph-dependent constrained gem accurately predicted growth rate pro- ton pump activity by atpase and a metabolic shift from mixed acid fermentation to homolactic fermentation.

although a single microbe is not directly representative of the gut community the com- bined gem mechanistically explained how both organisms benefit from the mutualism correctly predicted how the interaction affects biofluid metabolome composition and even described how gut microbes can rescue hosts withlethal gene deletions .host-microbe interactions have also been modeled using a single 'supra-organism model' to representall gut microbes simultaneously thereby also avoiding optimization-related issues with multiple microbial bio- mass types.

for example if the removal of a single reac- tion from the gem results in a large improvement of gem predictions this suggests that this reaction was er- roneously added and should be considered for removal.

the incorrect predictions pinpointed errors in both the gem con- struction process and in the experimental procedures and also pinpointed distinct metabolic features of l. plantarum wcfs1 for example i the incomplete fo- late biosynthesis pathway in the gem was in part dueto a missing ec number for a correctly annotated gene as well as no reactions in metacyc for another ec num- ber.

addi- tionally host behavior such as diet intake has a great and reproducible influence on the microbiota compo- sition gems have been created for hosts of particu- lar interest such as mouse and human  and have even been trimmed down to tissue-specific gems including a gem for colon-derived tissue the hu- man recon 2.04 gem was adapted to be not only tissue specific but context specific as well.
