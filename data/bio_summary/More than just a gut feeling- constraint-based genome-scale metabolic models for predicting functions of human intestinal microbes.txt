This process of using experimental data to find incorrect GEM predictions and subsequently making changes to the GEM has also been combined into algorithms such as GrowMatch that will make a minimal number of changes to a GEM while maximizing its coherence to experimental data.The established manual GEM reconstruction processultimately results in high-quality GEMs but is extremely time-consuming The advent of high throughput sequencing and concurrent rapid increase in available biological data warrants a faster approach which isprovided by the RAVEN toolbox and the Model- SEED approach In both cases the process of geno- me annotation draft GEM construction and gap-filling has been fully automated although extensive manual curation remains necessary to sustain a high quality This curation process has recently been streamlined for gut microbes specifically as part of the AGORA metabolic GEM resource A distinguishing feature of the AGORA GEM resource is the semi-automatic curation of ModelSEED GEMs where corrections that are manually applied to a single GEM are propagated to the GEMs of other gut microbes.

However this approach is not suitable if the community members exhibit cross-feeding or substrate competition.A similar approach was taken to identify media that stimulate commensal or mutualistic relationships be- tween each possible pair of seven well-known microbes This number was rapidly expanded to 118 species coupled in 6.903 pairs driven by automated curation of over a hundred GEMs The latter study not only focused on cooperation but also specifically on identify- ing media that induce competition between pairs of microbes.

Secondly we describe appli- cations of GEMs for gut microbiome research that enable i selecting minimal and defined growth media for previously cultured as well as not yet cultured gut microbes ii predicting growth and phenotypes of gut microbes and their influence on health and disease andmodeling co-cultures and multispecies interactions of gut microbes and the human host Fig.

Moreover these predictions were instrumental in the prediction of diets to improve the metabolic function of gut microbiota Ulti- mately this research will lead to increased understan- ding of the interactions of the gut microbiota and its host and on its role in gut homeostasis and dysfunc- tion and it will ultimately pave to way to improve human health using specific gut microbes or dietary interventions.Conclusion and perspectivesAfter a few decades of characterizing gut microbiota composition many gut microbes have been sequenced Over 200 of these genome sequences have been used to generate GEMs in most cases by automated tools These GEMs have been used to predict growth phenotypes of single microbes and communities in laboratory and in vivo settings.Here we reviewed three ways in which GEMs contri- bute in elucidating gut microbiome function.

Here we first de- scribe the challenges in the use of GEMs for the design of defined media and then how GEMs have been suc- cessfully used for the design of defined media and how similar approaches can be used to design suitable de- fined media for not yet cultured bacteria.There are three main challenges in the use of GEMsfor the design of defined growth media i The in silicobiomass composition is an influential aspect of the GEM as it defines all metabolites required for growth The omission of even a single metabolite in this compo- sition can prevent the GEM from predicting an essential media supplement.

Therefore the GEMs of lactic acid bacteria are used to study their metabolic capa- bilities and behavior in fermentation processes  as well as their probiotic functions  The GEM of L. plantarum WCFS1 was automatically constructed based on its genome sequence and subsequently exten- sively manually curated  The GEM was then used to predict the essentiality of 36 compounds in a chemically defined growth medium.

The metabolic model for the pathogenic P. aeruginosa also showed a versatile metabolic pattern and accounted for virulence inducing pathways such as exopolysaccharide alginate synthesis .In more recent research highly quantitative proteo- mics and metabolic measurements were used to impose pH-dependent constraints on the GEM of Enterococcus faecalis a human gut pathogen The pH-dependent constrained GEM accurately predicted growth rate pro- ton pump activity by ATPase and a metabolic shift from mixed acid fermentation to homolactic fermentation.

The analysis revealed that both strains produce vitamins es- sential amino acids and mucosal binding proteins but that they differed in their production of potential in- ducers of tumor necrosis factor The prediction of metabolic fluxes from omics data relies on the concept that on average gene expression levels are a proxy for fluxes.

Ultimately the researchers were able to design a refined and chemically defined medium CDM3 that faci- litated both in silico and in vitro growth albeit that growth was still rather poor and unreliable The requirement for manual curation of ModelSEED GEMs prior to media design has been substantially reduced due to the presence of 773 semi-automatically curated GEMs of relevant gut microbes  in the AGORA GEM resource .
