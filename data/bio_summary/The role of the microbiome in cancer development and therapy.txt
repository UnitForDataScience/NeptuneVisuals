sivan et al noted that tumor growth varied depending on whether the mice were obtained from the jackson laboratory jax or taconic vendors.117 these mice were on the same genetic background c57bl6 but had distinct microbial composi- tions.

the authors identified bifidobacterium as crucial and therapeutic feeding ie probiotics of bifido- bacterium alone was able to mediate anti-pd-l1 efficacy by altering dendritic cell activity that enhanced cd8-positive t-cell responses to eradicate tumors.in the other study vetizou et al observed a rapid shift in the microbiome upon anti-ctla-4 administration char- acterized by a reduction in bacteroidales and burkholderiales and an increase in the abundance in clostridiales.114 anti- ctla-4 immunotherapy failed to reduce tumor burden in a germ-free state but this defect was overcome by introduc- ing b. fragilis andor b. thetaiotaomicron.

viaud et al discovered that the antitumor effects of cp were attenuated in mice raised to be germ-free or made so using antibiotics.127 in the latter case antibiotics selectively targeting gram-positive bac- teria compared with gram-negative-targeted antibiotics sig- nificantly reduced cp efficacy.
