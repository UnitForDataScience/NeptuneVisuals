the discoverers have identified the potential importance of these bacteriabacteria-derived molecules should be considered as having an im- munological and pathological role in filarial disease as the nema- todes are able to survive in immune competent hosts andwolbachia manipulate of mast cell-mediated vasodilation to enhance infectivity of vector-borne larvae.wolbachia is the principal driver of innate and adaptive th1 inflammatory immunity which contributes to disease and en- hanced infectivity.wolbachia inserts a genome fragment into the host x chromo- some necessary for female nematode fertility .

pseudomonas is implicated in the water of individuals at high risk for in- flammatory bowel disease .while tetracycline as anti-wolbachia therapy delivers safe macro- filaricidal activity and superior therapeutic outcomes compared to all standard antifilarial treatments this therapy is contraindicated in children under 8 years of age and pregnancy .therefore the primary goal of the anti-wolbachia consortium is to find drugs and regimens that reduce the period of treatment from weeks to 7 days or less and find drugs which would be safe in exclude target populations children and pregnancy .therefore the goal of any treatment that destroys the wolbachia or shifts the gender-preference from female to male of the onchocerca proves to reduce the number of onchocerca and improve the vertebral host health status akin to the present treatment for onchocerca riverblindness.

based on the recent recognition of the biological im- portance of wolbachia in the occurrence of major diseases in the underdeveloped countries such as oncho- cerciasis and the sexual nature of wolbachia's role in helminths reproduction the author hypothesizes that the edcs are shifting the host's hormonal milieu in a more estrogenic direction and increasing reproduction of helminths changing the gastrointestinal microbiota.

when doxycycline and ivermectin were used together doxycycline doxy dose 10 mgkgday and ivermectin ivm 6 microgramkg orally weekly the resultant loss of both wolbachia and nematoid dna were similar to those of control worms suggesting a loss of both wolbachia and nematodes.

are the estrogenic hormonal effects of environmental toxins affecting small intestinal bacterial and microfilaria overgrowthedward lichtenwayne state college of medicine department of obstetrics and gynecology usaa b s t r a c t the important role of microfilaria worms in human and animal disease remains an area of key disagreement between the naturopathic and allopathic physicians.

while microfilaria infections are rampart in undeveloped countries they rarely rise to identification as a cause of disease in western countries.

new research studies in the diagnosis and treatment of sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and ibd inflammatory bowel diseases of ulcerative colitis crohn's disease and microcytic colitis may make both sides equally correct.

a study of rifaximin failures in sibo positive individuals finds biomarkers of decreased free androgen index fai high incidence of autoimmune disease and elevated sex hormone binding globulin shbg.

a thorough case controlled observation of symptoms matched with biological culture colony count and concentration of microfilaria in disease before and after the aforementioned anabolic treatment may answer the hypothesis.introductionbackgroundmicrofilaria refers to a pre-larvae or advanced embryo stage that exists prior to the first larva stage of certain parasitic nematodes helminiths of the family onchocercidae.

it should include treatment of the underlying disease nutritional support and cyclical gastro-intestinal selective antibiotics.

prognosis is usually serious determined mostly by the underlying dis- ease that led to s.i.b.o .this bacterial overgrowth has been confirmed in 45 of individuals with crohn's disease and 17.8 of those with ulcerative colitis.

in a second study 26.5 of crohn's disease patients were con- sidered sibo .

autoimmunity is inherent in both sibo and in- flammatory bowel disease .the physiology of raising the fai with the nandrolonestanozololcombination is as follows nandrolone has greater than 30-times affi- nity for the a-r as does any bio-identical or xeno-estrogen therefore nandrolone should keep the xeno-estrogens out of the cell.

up to a 100-fold increase in fai was noted in the 2014 endometriosis case report where a most extreme disease state was reversed.the hypothesis theorywill shifting to a more anabolic milieu change the microbiota and reduce symptoms of gastrointestinal diseasecurrent thinking puts bacteria at the center of two prominent gas- trointestinal diseases helicobacter pylori- peptic ulcer and methane producing bacteria- small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo.

only one report in the medical literature has shown an improvement in crohn's disease with added back testosterone.
