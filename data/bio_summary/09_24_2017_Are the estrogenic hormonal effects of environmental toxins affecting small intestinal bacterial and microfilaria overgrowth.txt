Based on the recent recognition of the biological im- portance of Wolbachia in the occurrence of major diseases in the underdeveloped countries such as oncho- cerciasis and the sexual nature of Wolbachia's role in helminths reproduction the author hypothesizes that the EDCs are shifting the host's hormonal milieu in a more estrogenic direction and increasing reproduction of helminths changing the gastrointestinal microbiota.

When doxycycline and ivermectin were used together doxycycline DOXY dose 10 mgkgday and ivermectin IVM 6 microgramkg orally weekly the resultant loss of both Wolbachia and nematoid DNA were similar to those of control worms suggesting a loss of both Wolbachia and nematodes.

Pseudomonas is implicated in the water of individuals at high risk for in- flammatory bowel disease .While tetracycline as anti-Wolbachia therapy delivers safe macro- filaricidal activity and superior therapeutic outcomes compared to all standard antifilarial treatments this therapy is contraindicated in children under 8 years of age and pregnancy .Therefore the primary goal of the anti-Wolbachia consortium is to find drugs and regimens that reduce the period of treatment from weeks to 7 days or less and find drugs which would be safe in exclude target populations children and pregnancy .Therefore the goal of any treatment that destroys the Wolbachia or shifts the gender-preference from female to male of the Onchocerca proves to reduce the number of Onchocerca and improve the vertebral host health status akin to the present treatment for Onchocerca riverblindness.

The discoverers have identified the potential importance of these bacteriaBacteria-derived molecules should be considered as having an im- munological and pathological role in filarial disease as the nema- todes are able to survive in immune competent hosts andWolbachia manipulate of mast cell-mediated vasodilation to enhance infectivity of vector-borne larvae.Wolbachia is the principal driver of innate and adaptive Th1 inflammatory immunity which contributes to disease and en- hanced infectivity.Wolbachia inserts a genome fragment into the host X chromo- some necessary for female nematode fertility .

Present allopathic treatment of onchocerciasis utilizes al- bendazole and avermectin as therapy against the microfilaria larvae and doxycycline as bactericidal for Wolbachia.

Both naturopathic and al- lopathic treatments share a common focus on the suppression of the underlying bacterium Wolbachia infesta- tion.

In some species of Onchocercidae the release of microfilariae by the adult female is periodic--occurring at a parti- cular time of the day or night to increase chance of being picked up by Address 555 S.

The nematodes parasitic worms not only contain significant amounts of Wolbachia but also the nematodes through transovarially transmission moves the bacteria from the adult female uterus to the offspring .

The failure to do so leaves the nematode a male that grows and dies without reproducing.As the Wolbachia bacteria are needed by the host nematode they represent a target for therapy.

It has been well known for more than 30 years that tetracycline which kills intracellular bacteria such as Wolbachia also kills the nematodes Brugia pahangi and Litomosoides sigmodontis .
