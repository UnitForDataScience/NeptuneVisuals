HFD Induces Phenotypic Heterogeneity in an Isogenic Population of 50 C57BL6J Mice within 3 WeeksHFD feeding caused segregation of physiological phenotypes for diabetes cumulative glycemia and obesity BW and thresholds on cumulative glycemia and BW stratify the population into three disease sub-phenotypes lean normoglycemic LNG lean impaired glucose tolerance L-IGT and obese impaired glucose tolerance Ob-IGT.Short-term 3 weeks HFD feeding generates heterogeneous phenotypes for BW and glucose tolerance in C57BL6J male mice.

Glucose tolerance tests were used to determine glycemia 15 min after glucose injection T15 cumulative glycemia CG cumulative glycemia above baseline dG the disappearance rate of glucose from blood in minutes K15to30 and K15to75ins insulin secretion 15 30 and 75 min after glucose injection I15 I30 and I75 respectively cumulative insulinemia CI cumulative insulinemia above baseline dI and the ratio of cumulative glycemia to cumulative insulinemia IcumG.

Islets were then incubated in 2.8 mM glucose to measure basal insulin production and subsequently in 16.7 mM glucose to measure glucose stimulated insulin secretion.ER StressER stress was assessed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after 7 days of differentiation upon ER stress stimulation by 50 ngmL tunicamycin and rescued by 10 mM PBA or 10 mM TMAO.

HFD-fed mice became divergent from CHD-fed mice for IGT as- sessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests IP-GTTs and body weight phenotypes with strong and permanent heteroge- neity in glucose tolerance and body weight Figures S1A-S1C.

Applying a threshold of 2 SD above the mean of cumulative glycemia and BW defined three disease sub-groups of extreme responders to HFD feeding lean with impaired glucose tolerance L-IGT obese with impaired glucose tolerance Ob-IGT and non-responder lean normoglycemic LNG A.

Given that TMAO was also shown to reduce ER stress in b cells   we then tested the role of TMAO on glucose toler- ance and insulin secretion in vivo in mice and in vitro in isolated islets.TMAO Improves Glucose Homeostasis and Insulin Secretion In VivoTo assess potential therapeutic effects of TMAO in vivo we carried out glucose tolerance and insulin secretion tests in CHD- and HFD-fed mice treated by chronic subcutaneousFigure 3.

HFD feeding resulted in sig- nificant elevation of fasting glycemia and insulinemia glucose intolerance enhanced insulin secretion induced by glucose and increased BW after 7 weeks when compared to CHD-fed mice.

TMAO infusion had no effect on glucose homeostasis in- sulin secretion or BW in CHD-fed mice E. In contrast glucose tolerance A and 5B was partially restored by chronic 6-week TMAO treatment in HFD-fed mice as indicated by significant reduction of glycemia during the IP-GTT  A and cumulative glycemia during the test B in TMAO-treated mice when compared to saline-treated controls.

Improved glucose tolerance in TMAO-treated HFD-fed mice was associated with further significant enhancement of insulinsecretion response to glucose by TMAO in these mice  C and 5D.
