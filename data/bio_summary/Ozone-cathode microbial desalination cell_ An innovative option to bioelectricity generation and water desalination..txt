BrillasKeywordsOzonationMicrobial desalination cell MDC Electricity generationa b s t r a c t Microbial desalination cell MDC is a new approach of water desalination methods which is based on ionic species removal from water in proportion to the electric current generated by bacteria.

A new BES for partial or complete water desalination is the microbial desalination cell MDC which integrates microbial fuel cell MFC and electrodial- ysis ED processes to treat wastewater desalinate saline waters and simultaneously produce electricity in a single reactor  o'.A typical MDC is fabricated from three chambers anode middle and cathode chambers separated by cation exchange membranes CEM and anion exchange membrane AEM.

Here the performance of MDC using ozone as a new electron acceptor O3-MDC was evaluated versus another operated independently with oxygen O2-MDC.

Results showed the maximum open-circuit voltages of 628 and 1331 mV for 20 g L-1 NaCl desalination in O2-MDC and O3- MDC respectively.

The O3-MDC produced a maximum power density of 4.06 W m-2 about 11 times higher than O2-MDC while at the same time was able to remove about 74 of salt 55.58 in the O2- MDC.

Accordingly the results revealed that ozone can enhance MDC performance either as a desalination process or as a pre-treatment reactor for downstream desalination processes.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionSafe drinking water is an essential for humans and other living beings.

Thus loss of ionic species from the middle chamber results in desalination of water without any external feed pressure additional waste and external elec- tricity requirements.In an MDC the ion removal rate is affected by many factors such as salt concentration reactor volume retention time of wastewater and ion solution membrane surface area microbial oxidation rate and the ultimate electron acceptor used in cathode chamber  .

used ferricyanide as the catholyte of MDC to desalinate water and the maximum power density of 2 W m-2 31 W m-3 was produced in their reactor.

Air-cathode MDC reduced the conduc- tivity of 5 g L-1 and 20 g L-1 NaCl solutions only by 43 - 6 and 50 - 7 respectively.

used microalgae of Chlorella vulgaris as an oxygen generator in MDC cathode chamber and observed the maximum power density of 20.25 mW m-2 in the system.
