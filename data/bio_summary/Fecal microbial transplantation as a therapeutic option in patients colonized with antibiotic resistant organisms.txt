at this point fmt has only demonstrated effi- cacy in reducing mdr organisms within the bowel and may need to be used in combination with other decolonization strategies to ensure mdr-eradication of all contaminated sites.decolonization of enteric mdr organisms may prove especially useful in the subset of immunocom- promised patients who are susceptible to infection from endogenous bacteria through the gastrointestinal tract such as those undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.mdr infections are rampant in this patient population and are associated with signifi- cant mortality.fmt which is safe in immunocom- promised patients may not prevent bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia in these patients but it may select for infections that are more easily treated.fmt offers substantial benefits over antibiotics as a decolonization therapy.

mdr bacteria are believed to colonize the gastrointes- tinal tract contributing to the reservoir of antibiotic resistant abr genes within the gut and subse- quently infecting their host.patients that become col- onized with mdr bacteria often require prolonged hospitalization which increases the risk of acquiring further mdr bacteria.

using fecal microbial transplantation as a method to replenish a healthy gut microbial environment and restore colonization resis- tance has showed astonishing effectiveness in the treat- ment of recurring infection with clostridium difficile with cure rates ranging from 80-95 following a single infusion.in our single center study of 20 patients who underwent fmt for recurrent cdi we showed using a combination of metagenomics and dna microarray that the number of antibiotic-resistant genes in the resistome of patients was significantly reduced following the procedure.these results were further corroborated by jouhten et al.

manges and colleagues recently published a review summarizing 8 different case reports on the suc- cess of fmt in the eradication of mdr organisms further supporting the concept of using fmt for this purpose.

the side effect profile of fmt is modest with no direct serious adverse effects noted.most importantly selective decontamination antibiotic treatment is associated with an increase in the overall incidence of abr genes in intestinal microbes.as such there is a reluctance to institutegut microbes223widespread selective decontamination antibiotic treat- ment despite its apparent beneficial effect on adverse outcomes.fmt may act as an alternative therapy to decontamination without perpetuating the prob- lem of mdr organisms.conclusiona joint statement released by the world health orga- nization world organization for animal health and the united nations in september 2016 identified amr as a fundamental threat to human health development and security.the ability of fmt to dramatically reduce the number of abr genes in a patient's resistome offers a potentially important ther- apeutic option.

in 8 patients undergoing fmt for recurrent cdi using a quantita- tive pcr array containing 85 abr genes.in both studies fmt proved to be a safe and effective thera- peutic option for recurrent cdi.

unfortunately persistent reser- voirs of mdr can occur in hospital settings leading to a spread of mdr throughout the patient population.the centers for disease control and prevention rec- ommend contact precautions i.e.

however the emergence of mdr organisms as a result of widespread antibiotic usage has left the world on the cusp of a 'post-antibiotic' era.an approach to address these mdr organisms is required in the healthcare setting to prevent the resurgence of previously preventable infection-related adverse outcomes.

patients infected with mdr bacteria stay in hospital longer and experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality.both methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre infections have been shown to be associated with worse clinical outcomes.

although no larger randomized controlled tri- als have been performed to study the efficacy and safety of fmts for mdr organisms preliminary evidence is promising and suggests that a non-antibiotic therapy for abr infections may be in the future of health care.the future of fmt in the health care systemsince their discovery antibiotics have drastically changed the clinical approach to the treatment of bac- terial infections.

fmt may prove useful in the decolonization of intestinal mdr organisms.

fmt was also effective in reducing the number of abr genes in the patients' resistome.

the use of fmt as a decolonization agent may prove effective in preventing disease outbreaks and in mini- mizing the length of time colonized patients spend under costly and dangerous contact isolation precau- tions.
