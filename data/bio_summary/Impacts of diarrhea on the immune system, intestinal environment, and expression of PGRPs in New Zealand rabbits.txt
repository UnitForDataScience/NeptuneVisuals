PeerJ 5e4100 DOI of diarrhea on the intestinal development and environment in weaned rabbits and characterized the intestinal flora associated with diarrhea in rabbits in order to elucidate the association between the rabbit intestinal environment and its health.A normal intestinal flora is important for the maintenance of animal health in terms of intestinal development nutrient digestion and absorption and immunity  .

Thinning of the intestinal wall shortening of the intestinal tract and shrinking of intestinal villi are detrimental to intestinal development and nutrientabsorption .

The sequences of PGLYRP-1 PGLYRP-2 and PGLYRP-3 have been determined through homology searching of the NCBI and Ensembl databases yet their functions in rabbit diarrhea have not been documented.In this study intestinal tissues and blood samples were collected from rabbits with diarrhea and healthy rabbits for analysis of changes in intestinal histology serum immune indicators and the expression of PGRPs in rabbits with diarrhea.

A fragment of the duodenum was removed at the same position rinsed with 0.9 saline and fixed in paraformaldehyde for the preparation of intestinal sections.Assessment of intestinal environmentCecal contents were collected and the pH was measured immediately with a pH meter DELTA 320 Shanghai China.

These data suggest that young rabbits might combat harmful diarrhea-causing intestinal bacteria by upregulating intestinal PGRPs.GroupTotal tagsTaxon tagsUnclassified tagsUnique tagsOTU numberAnalysis of floral differences between healthy rabbits and those with diarrheaHigh-throughput sequencing data indicated that 57286 - 6637 mean - SD tags were detected in each sample with no significant difference between the healthy 57127 - 7484 mean - SD and diarrhea groups 57445 - 7352 mean - SD P  0.05.

In addition early feeding slow weaning and increased farm sanitation are recommended.CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion diarrhea severely impairs intestinal development and immune function in young rabbits and induces the upregulation of intestinal antibacterial proteins.

It causes a disturbance in the intestinal microflora and sometimes death resulting in considerable losses to the rabbit farming industry .

They thereby play a crucial role in host immunity and the modulation of the host intestinal microenvironment   .
