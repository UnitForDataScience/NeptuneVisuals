in sum rhizobia are important elements of an upcoming new green revolution where plant-associated microorganisms are key players of economical and ecological crop yield increases both as a direct source of fixed nitrogen in the agroecosystem as well as through acting as promoters of plant growth and plant health.during symbiotic interaction the rhizobia induce the formation of specialized plant structures known as nodules   where nitrogen fixation takes place.

here we provide a brief overview of the current knowledge on three main aspects of rhizobia interaction trade of fixed nitrogen with the plant diplomacy in terms of communication and possible synergistic effects and warfare as antagonism and plant control over symbiosis.

rhizobia provide the plant with fixed nitrogen in the form of ammonia while the plant provides the rhizobia a homeostatic environment to undergo heterotrophic multiplication using carbon derived from photosynthates and additional micronutrients e.g.

a main point going forward is to better understand this variability in order to select those rhizobia strains more effective in rewarding the plant through the fixed nitrogen offered to the plant for use as elite inoculants.diplomacyaside from the classical exchange of benefits and the reciprocal control of the fitness trade the rhizobia-plant mutualism evolved the capacity for partner discrimination.

experiments aimed at deciphering the exchange of signals and the effect on plant growth in reconstructed root microbiotas are needed to move toward a more comprehensive view of the intimate sociobiological relationship between the plant and its rhizobial partners and then promote a rationale selection of elite rhizobial inoculants.author contributionsam conceived the study.
