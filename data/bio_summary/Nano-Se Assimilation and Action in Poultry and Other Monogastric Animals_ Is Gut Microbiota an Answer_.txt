The second suggestion that nano-Se can be con- verted to SeMet is fundamentally wrong since SeMet cannot be synthesized in the humananimal body only plants and bacteria can produce it There are very attractive suggestions that gut micro- biota can oxidize nano-Se into seleniteselenate or reduce it into H2Se with the following synthesis of sele- noproteins Recently some experimental evidence have been provided to prove that nano-Se particles can be dissolved and oxidized to inorganic oxoanions of Se in the gut in the presence of microbiota before their absorption Furthermore a hypothetical schematic diagram showing an intracellular dynamic cycle of endogenous selenium nanoparticles SeNPs was pro- posed In fact it was suggested that elemental selen- ium could be re-oxidized by superoxide radicals into selenite.

An additional confirmation of the stress-related changes in biological systems due to nano- Se supplementation came from the recent study showing that biogenic nano-Se could activate the nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 Nrf2 and increase the expression of its downstream genes responsible for anti- oxidant synthesis in dose- and time-dependent manners Furthermore the authors found that the knock- down of Nrf2 significantly blocked the antioxidative effect of such nano-Se particles.When critically analysing positive effects of nano-Se supplementation on productive and reproductive performance of poultry farm animals and fish it is necessary to take into account that in most cases Se did not improve the performance but rather prevented performance deterioration due to environmental or nutritional constraints.

For example in a recently published paper only few genes 18 proteins and none of them are directly related to Se metabolism were affected in the liver due to overdose of nano-Se in chickens  while it is known that other forms of dietary Se including SeMet can affect few hundred genes.It is important to understand if nano-Se can build any Se reserves in the body like SeMet and if those reserves are available in stress conditions.It is necessary to design a technology able to provide nano-Se particles of the same size stability and rea- sonably good at least 6-12 months storability .It is likely that microbial probiotics can be useful in the conversion of nano-selenium used as feed additive.

This would complicate the issue further and therefore it seems unlikely that nano-Se could have a direct AO effect in the biological systems.Therefore similar to other forms of selenium used in animal diets an antioxidant effect of nano-Se is related to selenoprotein gene expression and protein synthesis.

Since the gut microbiota is responsible for the excretion of excess selenium by its methylation and elemental Se formation  the enhancementmodulation of the microbiota could open a new horizon to deal with possible nano-Se toxicity.Positive effects of nano-Se in animal nutrition should not overshadow possible detrimental consequences of its usage.

bulgaricus LB-12 organic Se compounds mainly SeCys and SeMet were produced and also nano-Se particles were partially dissolved and non- metabolically transformed into inorganic selenium probably with the assistance of substances excreted by the bacteria cell wall Alternatively elemental selenium can be reducedcon- verted into selenide by a selenite-respiring bacterium for example Bacillus selenitireducens.

Furthermore another anaerobic bacterium Veillonella atypica was shown to be able to reduce selenium oxyanions to form elemental selenium with its further reduction by the bacterium to form reactiveselenide Interestingly more than 45 years earlier it34oxidation of elemental selenium Se0 by chemohetero- trophs and chemoautotrophic thiobacilli was confirmed by using 75Se0 as a tracer The authors showed that soil slurries were able to oxidize Se0 with SeO2- and SeO2- formation.

Kochish2 and Oksana A. Velichko4BackgroundRecently a comprehensive review paper devoted to roles of nano-Se in livestock and fish nutrition has been published in the Nanoscale Research Letters The authors described in great detail an issue related to nano-Se production and its possible applications in animal industry and medicine.

In fact recently it has been shown that chickens are characterized by reverse peristaltic contrac- tions which could move the marker from the cloaca to the gizzard Direct involvement of nano-Se into selenoprotein syn- thesis could be expected since in cell culture nano-Se increased selenoproteins GSH-Px and TR activity.

In many cases animal experi- ments were conducted at extremely low Se background level and therefore adding Se in any available form can have positive effects.The challenges of nano-Se commercialization to be used as a feed additive could be as followsIt is necessary to understand molecular mechanisms of nano-Se absorption assimilation and action at the cellular subcellular and gene levels.
