the second suggestion that nano-se can be con- verted to semet is fundamentally wrong since semet cannot be synthesized in the humananimal body only plants and bacteria can produce it there are very attractive suggestions that gut micro- biota can oxidize nano-se into seleniteselenate or reduce it into h2se with the following synthesis of sele- noproteins recently some experimental evidence have been provided to prove that nano-se particles can be dissolved and oxidized to inorganic oxoanions of se in the gut in the presence of microbiota before their absorption furthermore a hypothetical schematic diagram showing an intracellular dynamic cycle of endogenous selenium nanoparticles senps was pro- posed in fact it was suggested that elemental selen- ium could be re-oxidized by superoxide radicals into selenite.

an additional confirmation of the stress-related changes in biological systems due to nano- se supplementation came from the recent study showing that biogenic nano-se could activate the nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 nrf2 and increase the expression of its downstream genes responsible for anti- oxidant synthesis in dose- and time-dependent manners furthermore the authors found that the knock- down of nrf2 significantly blocked the antioxidative effect of such nano-se particles.when critically analysing positive effects of nano-se supplementation on productive and reproductive performance of poultry farm animals and fish it is necessary to take into account that in most cases se did not improve the performance but rather prevented performance deterioration due to environmental or nutritional constraints.

for example in a recently published paper only few genes 18 proteins and none of them are directly related to se metabolism were affected in the liver due to overdose of nano-se in chickens  while it is known that other forms of dietary se including semet can affect few hundred genes.it is important to understand if nano-se can build any se reserves in the body like semet and if those reserves are available in stress conditions.it is necessary to design a technology able to provide nano-se particles of the same size stability and rea- sonably good at least 6-12 months storability .it is likely that microbial probiotics can be useful in the conversion of nano-selenium used as feed additive.

this would complicate the issue further and therefore it seems unlikely that nano-se could have a direct ao effect in the biological systems.therefore similar to other forms of selenium used in animal diets an antioxidant effect of nano-se is related to selenoprotein gene expression and protein synthesis.

since the gut microbiota is responsible for the excretion of excess selenium by its methylation and elemental se formation  the enhancementmodulation of the microbiota could open a new horizon to deal with possible nano-se toxicity.positive effects of nano-se in animal nutrition should not overshadow possible detrimental consequences of its usage.

bulgaricus lb-12 organic se compounds mainly secys and semet were produced and also nano-se particles were partially dissolved and non- metabolically transformed into inorganic selenium probably with the assistance of substances excreted by the bacteria cell wall alternatively elemental selenium can be reducedcon- verted into selenide by a selenite-respiring bacterium for example bacillus selenitireducens.

furthermore another anaerobic bacterium veillonella atypica was shown to be able to reduce selenium oxyanions to form elemental selenium with its further reduction by the bacterium to form reactiveselenide interestingly more than 45 years earlier it34oxidation of elemental selenium se0 by chemohetero- trophs and chemoautotrophic thiobacilli was confirmed by using 75se0 as a tracer the authors showed that soil slurries were able to oxidize se0 with seo2- and seo2- formation.

nanoscale research letters 2017 12612doi 10.1186s11671-017-2383-3nano-se assimilation and action in poultry and other monogastric animals is gut microbiota an answerpeter f. surai123  ivan i. kochish2 and oksana a. velichko4backgroundrecently a comprehensive review paper devoted to roles of nano-se in livestock and fish nutrition has been published in the nanoscale research letters the authors described in great detail an issue related to nano-se production and its possible applications in animal industry and medicine.

in fact recently it has been shown that chickens are characterized by reverse peristaltic contrac- tions which could move the marker from the cloaca to the gizzard direct involvement of nano-se into selenoprotein syn- thesis could be expected since in cell culture nano-se increased selenoproteins gsh-px and tr activity.

in many cases animal experi- ments were conducted at extremely low se background level and therefore adding se in any available form can have positive effects.the challenges of nano-se commercialization to be used as a feed additive could be as followsit is necessary to understand molecular mechanisms of nano-se absorption assimilation and action at the cellular subcellular and gene levels.

indeed nano-se behaviour in the gut warrants further investigation.in the aforementioned review  substantial attention is given to antimicrobial and anti-cancer properties of nano-se and it seems likely that the unique properties of nanoparticles could help in fighting various disease conditions.

one of the possible mechanisms pathways of nano-se action could be mediated by the gut microbiota which could convert nano-se into selenite h2se or se-phosphate with the following synthesis of selenoproteins fig.

the possibility of participation of gut microbiota in nano-se assimilation and metabolism needs to be further investigated in detail and advantages and disadvantages of nano-se as a source of se in animalpoultry nutrition await further critical evaluations.fundingpeter f. surai and ivan i. kochish are supported by a grant of the government of russian federation contract no.

and a basic understanding of the nano-se metabolism including absorption distribution and clearance is of great importance in animalpoultry sciences the mammalianavian gastrointestinal tract harbours trillions of commensal microorganisms collectively known as the microbiota for example chicken intestinal tract is composed of duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon and there are significant differ- ences in microbiota concentration and composition between the aforementioned gut sections interest- ingly the cecum is characterized by the most complextable 1 metallic selenium transformation by microorganisms334significant levels of se- 2 as aqueous hse- using se0 as a substrate earlier it was demonstrated that red sel- enium was reduced by obligate acidophile thiobacillus ferrooxidans under acidic ph 3 anaerobic conditionswith h2se production at a rate of 0.03 mmolmg protein microbial community dominated by the phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria on the other hand at the genus level the major microbial gen- era across all gut sections were shown to be lactobacillus enterococcus bacteroides and corynebacterium furthermore bacteroides was shown to be the dominant group in the cecum while lactobacillus was predominant in the small intestine sections duodenum jejunum and ileum .

indeed four major biological transformations of se are proven to occur in nature including reduction oxidation methylation and demethylation data accumulated for the last three decades clearly indicate that microorganisms play a major role in the selenium cycle in the environment by participating in both oxidation and reduction reactions interestingly the microbial oxidation of se0 to se4 by a group of unidentified autotrophic bacteria was discovered more than 90 years ago furthermore oxidation of elemental selenium to selenite by aheterotrophic bacterium bacillus megaterium isolated from soil was reported much later indeed se0 oxidation in soils was shown to occur at a relatively slow rate and to be largely biotic in nature and yields bothseo2- and seo2- furthermore the microbialh .
