policymakers are not known for their quickness so when the u.s. food and drug administration fda finally took steps to eliminate the most egregious agricul- tural use of antibiotics--growth promotion--consumers were already demanding more and the market responded with several big-name retailers announcing new more-restrictive antibiotic use policies for their suppliers.

in april 2016 the fda started procedures to withdraw approval for carbadox in u.s. food animals if the drug sponsors are unable to prove that it does not pose a cancer risk to humans .however the study by johnson et al.

in an attempt to compromise with food animal producers and drug companies some in the public health community including myself have agreed to classify ionophores as medically unimportant.

that began to change with a number of high-profile reports that described the emerging antibiotic resistance crisis in terms that the general public could understand and highlighted the potential risks of using antibiotics in food animals  .

investigating the impact of carbadox on the swine gut microbiome provides an important example of how even antimicrobial agents with no foreseeable utility inhuman medicine may pose a public health threat when used in food animals.u.s.
