The cohort used in the substudy included 26 pa- tients treated with surotomycin 125 mg twice daily n  9 or 250 mg twice daily n  9 or oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily n  8 for 10 days at the Foothills Medical Centre Calgary Canada.Faecal sample collectionFaecal samples 5 g undiluted and 2.5 g in 2.5 mL brain heart infusion broth with 10 glycerol were collected at day 0 baseline and at days 4 10 end of treatment 14 17 21 24 28 and 402.

difficile cultured from samples collected at the end of treatment from patients receiving surotomycin 125 mg twice daily appeared to be on average 10-fold higher compared with counts from pa- tients dosed with surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily P  0.08.

The patients were random- ized 111 to receive surotomycin 125 mg twice daily surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days.

Recurrence of CDI was observed in 48 patients receiv- ing surotomycin 125 mg twice daily at days 13 20 24 and 34 in 39 patients receiving surotomycin 250 mg twice daily at days 23 27 and 28 and in 18 patients receiving vancomycin 125 mg fourtimes daily at day 16.

In support of a role for Firmicutes for the prevention of CDI recurrences the initial results from a mainly Firmicutes com- position SER 109 faecal microbiota transplant were in favour of a role but a subsequent negative study raised concerns that there is more to be learned.Additional microbial ecological studies per- formed during the evaluation of other candidate CDI treatments would add to the literature on the relative role of different micro- biota groups in host ecological defence.In support of a hypothesis that reductions in C. difficile counts in faecal samples could be predictive of clinical cure of diarrheal dis- ease treatment of CDI with either surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or with vancomycin 125 mg four times daily each for 10 days re- sulted in comparable reductions of C. difficile numbers at or near the limit of detection at days 4 10 and 14.

Faecal samples were collected at days 0-42 to quantify both C. difficile by conventional culture and the major components of the microbiome by quanti- tative PCR.Results Surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily reduced faecal C. difficile counts from 105-107 log10 cfug at baseline to 102 cfug by days 4-10 of treatment.

Vancomycin reduced Firmicutes counts by 2.5-2.8 log10 surotomycin moderately suppressed these microbes in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusions In this Phase 2 trial substudy compared with vancomycin 125 mg four times daily surotomycin 250 mg twice daily is as active in vivo against C. difficile but was more sparing of microbiota.
