difficile cultured from samples collected at the end of treatment from patients receiving surotomycin 125 mg twice daily appeared to be on average 10-fold higher compared with counts from pa- tients dosed with surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily p  0.08. by 4 days after the end of treat- ment day 14 counts of c. difficile had risen such that no differ- ence was observed between baseline and end of treatment in patients receiving surotomycin 125 mg twice daily p  0.38. apparent spore counts were 2.5-3.0 log10 lower than total counts and were significantly reduced by all treatments by day 10 p 0.02. recurrence of cdi was observed in 48 patients receiv- ing surotomycin 125 mg twice daily at days 13 20 24 and 34 in 39 patients receiving surotomycin 250 mg twice daily at days 23 27 and 28 and in 18 patients receiving vancomycin 125 mg fourtimes daily at day 16. comparing 8 subjects who suffered recurrences with 17 who did not 88 recurrent subjects' c. difficile counts rose prior to and at recurrence of cdi to a c. difficile mean count of 6.7 log10 with median toxin cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay titres of 2000 range 204000. of 17 subjects who did not suffer a recurrence c. difficile counts in the post-treatment period remained generally low or showed transient rises in 13 of sub- jects and toxin was detected in 417 subjects between days 23 and 35 with titres of 200 200 1000 and 4000 p  0.0005 compar- ing differences in toxin re-expression in recurrent versus non- recurrent subjects in the post-treatment period.microbiota shiftsthe mean log10 cfug  sd of microbiota bacterial groups are shown in table .

bacteroidetes and prevotella mean counts increased 0.7 log10 or remained unchanged with surotomycin 125 and 250 mg twice daily respectively whereas vancomycin reduced counts by 2.5-3.2 log10 p  0.02. vancomycin reduced firmicutes counts by 2.5-2.8 log10 surotomycin moderately suppressed these microbes in a dose-dependent manner.conclusions in this phase 2 trial substudy compared with vancomycin 125 mg four times daily surotomycin 250 mg twice daily is as active in vivo against c. difficile but was more sparing of microbiota.

in support of a role for firmicutes for the prevention of cdi recurrences the initial results from a mainly firmicutes com- position ser 109 faecal microbiota transplant were in favour of a role but a subsequent negative study raised concerns that there is more to be learned.additional microbial ecological studies per- formed during the evaluation of other candidate cdi treatments would add to the literature on the relative role of different micro- biota groups in host ecological defence.in support of a hypothesis that reductions in c. difficile counts in faecal samples could be predictive of clinical cure of diarrheal dis- ease treatment of cdi with either surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or with vancomycin 125 mg four times daily each for 10 days re- sulted in comparable reductions of c. difficile numbers at or near the limit of detection at days 4 10 and 14. surotomycin 125 mg twice daily was less effective in the same period.

the patients were random- ized 111 to receive surotomycin 125 mg twice daily surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days.

faecal samples were collected at days 0-42 to quantify both c. difficile by conventional culture and the major components of the microbiome by quanti- tative pcr.results surotomycin 250 mg twice daily or vancomycin 125 mg four times daily reduced faecal c. difficile counts from 105-107 log10 cfug at baseline to 102 cfug by days 4-10 of treatment.

and acidaminococcus spp.- the surotomycin development programme hypothesized that the preservation of these bacteria would reduce cdi recurrence.in phase 1 studies surotomycin was well tolerated following single oral doses of up to 4 g and multiple doses of up to 1 g twice daily for 14 days in healthy volunteers.surotomycin undergoes minimal systemic absorption and the faeces is the primary route of elimination following oral administration.furthermore in a phase 2 clinical trial surotomycin demonstrated greater efficacy at achieving sustained response compared with vancomycin clini- caltrials.gov reference nct01085591.to further evaluate the factors contributing to an improved sustained response this single-centre substudy evaluated the impact of surotomycin on the normal intestinal microbiota compared with vancomycin by quantitative pcr qpcr the in vivo activity of surotomycin againstc.

surotomycin is no longer in development due to failed phase 3 efficacy results.introductionthe objective of antimicrobial treatment of clostridium difficile in- fection cdi is to kill or inhibit the pathogen in the intestinal lumen thereby arresting the production of c. difficile toxins while at the same time minimizing further damage to the normal intestinal microbiota a strategy that prevents subsequent recurrence of infection.currently vancomycin and fidaxomicin are the only antibiotics approved for the treatment of cdi with metronidazole also used in accordance with its approval for anaerobic bacterial infections.

difficile counts during treatment of cdi but are damaging to other components of the microbiome such as bacteroidetes and clostridium cluster iv and xiva microbes.-the dysbiosis of intes- tinal microbiota caused by vancomycin metronidazole and broad- spectrum antibiotics leads to an increased risk of cdi recurrence.in contrast fidaxomicin a macrocyclic antibiotic appears to be sparing of the three main normal microbiota groups while simultaneously suppressing c. difficile counts during treatment.

treatment with both doses of surotomycin and with vancomycin reduced firmicutes counts and the reduction was most pronounced during vanco- mycin treatment.

as well as clostridial cluster xiva and cluster iv microbes observed with fidaxomicin treatment but which were each markedly impaired during vancomycin treatment imputed a role for these microbial groups in preventing recurrences of cdi.in this substudy of the surotomycin phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial surotomycin treat- ment spared the bacteroidesprevotella groups whereas vanco- mycin significantly suppressed these bacteria.
