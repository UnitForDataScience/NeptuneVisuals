when we analysed the its sequences our new strains grouped on a branch close to b. huanghuaihaiense ccbau 23303t 98.5 sequence similarity whereas b. iriomotense and b. ingae were found to be more distantly related with 95.1 and 94.7carbon source utilizationl-asparaginewwwwl-aspartic acid w  w w  l-glutamic acidw w w w  thymidine----glycerol-w -w  d-l-a-glycerol phosphate ---w  acetic acid    - cis-aconitic acid  - - a-hydroxy butyric acid ----w a-keto valeric acid----wsequence similarity respectively fig.

the br 10280t genome was found to have a g c content of 63.6 mol  which is in accordance with the value observed for other members of the genus bradyrhizobium and slightly different from b. huan- ghuaihaiense ccbau 23303t with a g c content of63.9 mol table .phenotypic characteristics of the novel strains that dif- ferentiated them from the closely related species b. huan- ghuaihaiense are presented in table .

phylogenetic analysis based on nodc gene sequences also placed the strains close to ccbau 23303t but different from this latter strain the sugarcane strains did not nodulate soybean although they effectivelycommunicated by erko stackebrandt.nodulated vigna unguiculata cajanus cajan and macrop- tilium atropurpureum.

the present study reports a detailed genotypic and functional characterization of four representative strains of this novel group br 10280t br 10266 br 10555 and br 10556.the strains were originally named p9-20 p4-7 p5-24 andp7-18 respectively.materials and methodsculture conditions and maintenancebacterial cultures were grown on yeast mannitol liq- uid ym or solid yma media vincent .

therefore the host range clearly functionally differentiates the strains from these other bradyrhizobium species.based on several outstanding characteristics of these strains in relation to related described bradyrhizobiumfig.

16s rrna sequence analysis multilo- cus sequence analysis mlsa and analysis of the 16s-23s rrna internal transcribed spacer showed that these strains form a novel clade close to but different from b. huang- huaihaiense strain ccbau 23303t.
