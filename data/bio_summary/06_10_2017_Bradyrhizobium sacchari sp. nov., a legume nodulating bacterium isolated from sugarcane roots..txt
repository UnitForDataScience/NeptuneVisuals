When we analysed the ITS sequences our new strains grouped on a branch close to B. huanghuaihaiense CCBAU 23303T 98.5 sequence similarity whereas B. iriomotense and B. ingae were found to be more distantly related with 95.1 and 94.7Carbon source utilizationl-Asparaginewwwwl-Aspartic acid w  w w  l-Glutamic acidw w w w  Thymidine----Glycerol-w -w  d-l-a-glycerol phosphate ---w  Acetic acid    - Cis-aconitic acid  - - a-Hydroxy butyric acid ----w a-Keto valeric acid----wsequence similarity respectively Fig.

.In contrast to B. huanghuaihaiense B. ottawaense B. diazoefficiens B. daqingense and B. japonicum neither of the tested strains BR 10280T nor BR 10266 could form nodules on Glycine max.

The BR 10280T genome was found to have a G C content of 63.6 mol  which is in accordance with the value observed for other members of the genus Bradyrhizobium and slightly different from B. huan- ghuaihaiense CCBAU 23303T with a G C content of63.9 mol Table .Phenotypic characteristics of the novel strains that dif- ferentiated them from the closely related species B. huan- ghuaihaiense are presented in Table .

Plants were incubated under artificial light 12 h photo- period at approximately 28 degC and nodule formation was evaluated 28 days after inoculation.Results and discussionSequence analyses of the partial 1226 nt 16S rRNA gene sequence of the four strains placed them in the Bradyrhizo- bium genus and together with other species within the B. japonicum superclade showing 100 sequence identity with B. iriomotense and B. ingae Fig.

The present study reports a detailed genotypic and functional characterization of four representative strains of this novel group BR 10280T BR 10266 BR 10555 and BR 10556.The strains were originally named P9-20 P4-7 P5-24 andP7-18 respectively.Materials and methodsCulture conditions and maintenanceBacterial cultures were grown on yeast mannitol liq- uid YM or solid YMA media Vincent .

16S rRNA sequence analysis multilo- cus sequence analysis MLSA and analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer showed that these strains form a novel clade close to but different from B. huang- huaihaiense strain CCBAU 23303T.

Phylogenetic analysis of the nodC gene sequences of the novel strains placed them on a sepa- rate branch close to B. huanghuaihaiense CCBAU 23303TB.
