with similar adhesion properties.potential probiotic isolates were selected by using sta- tistical application xlstat where in multivariate data analysis of all the probiotic properties were performed.

these isolates were shown to have most desirable probiotic properties these isolates were origi- nated from fermented products and considered safe for consumption thus traditional foods can serve as potential source of probiotic bacteria.

the present study aimed at investigating the probiotic properties of bacteria isolated from fermented mango pickle.

non-hemolytic fermenting microbiota isolated from mango pickle was screened in vitro for their basic probiotic properties such as acid tolerance bile salt lysozyme and salt tolerance.

out of eight isolates pufstp35 bacillus licheniformis pufstp38 bacillus amyloliquefaciens and pufstp39 bacillus subtilis showed similar trend to weissella cibaria mtcc 9814 that was used as a reference strain for profiling probiotic properties.

routine use of probiotic is considered to be helpful to overcome various clinical conditions such as infantile diarrhoea helicobacter pylori infections relaps- ing clostridium difficile colitis inflammatory bowel dis- ease and uro-genital infections reid et al.

many bacillus strains have been approved by regulatory agencies as probiotic strains for human consumption.

current work has been planed with the hypothesis that product harbours rare salt tolerant microorganism which could be potentially probiotic.
