In ART-treated individuals the correlations between IgAIgM ratios and CD4 T cell counts did not reach statistical significance although a similar trend was observed.Correlation between the levels of plasma and intestinal IgG and IgA specific for microbial and food antigens plasma sCD14 and T and B cell activationConsistent with previous reports we observed a significant increase of markers of microbial translocation sCD14 and LPS in plasma of HIV-1-infected patients with high inter-individ- ual variability .

Reduced levels of microbiota- specific IgG and IgA may facilitate transepithelial translocation and systemic dissemination of mucosal microbial antigens and contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in HIV-1-infected individuals.ResultsHIV-1 infection is associated with a significant increase in total IgG and IgA levels in plasma and IgM levels in intestinal secretionsTo analyze the levels of total and antigen-specific antibodies in systemic circulation and muco- sal secretions in HIV-1 infection plasma rectal wash and saliva samples were collected from 63 HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy ART 9 individuals not receiving ART who displayed open viremia non-controllers NC viral load 3420-263000 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml of blood 9 individuals spontaneously controlling viremia at low levels despite the absence of ART viral controllers VC viral load  1150 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml of blood and 25 HIV-1-seronegative controls study cohort characteristics are listed in .

Within this context we addressed a whether the levels of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens encoun- tered at mucosal surfaces are altered in HIV-1-infected individuals with varying CD4 T cell counts b whether the humoral responses to these antigens are differentially affected depend- ing on the compartment systemic versus mucosal antigen type bacterial food and yeast and predominant isotype of the antibody and c whether a systemic expansion of antibodies to mucosal antigens significantly contributes to the hyperglobulinemia observed in HIV-1- infected individuals.We present evidence of a significant increase of IgM levels and a decrease of IgGIgM and IgAIgM ratios of antibodies specific to mucosal microbial antigens in intestinal secretions of antiretroviral therapy ART -treated HIV-1-infected individuals indicative of a lack of help for class switch recombination.

In HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 T cell counts significantly reduced plasma IgG level to flagellin F2 was detected confirming the results of the protein microarray assay the decrease of IgG specific to CBir1 has not reached statistical significance.In intestinal secretions ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals displayed a robust increase in levels of IgM specific to all types of mucosal antigens .

A negative correlation was also observed between plasma sCD14 and frequency of circulating IgD-CD27 memory B cells R  -0.38 p  0.005.DiscussionThe study presented here reveals four major findings relevant to our understanding of sys- temic and mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1-infected individuals i elevated levels of total and antigen-specific IgM in intestinal secretions ii reduced IgGIgM and IgAIgM ratios of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens in intestinal secretions iii reduced IgG levels to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in plasma andiv a negative correlation between the levels of antigen-specific IgA in intestinal secretions and plasma levels of sCD14.

How- ever the precise nature of the underlying causes of the observed effects warrants further investigation in future studies addressing in detail the effect of HIV-1 infection of class- switching mechanisms in mucosal B cells.The apparent defect in Ig isotype switching from IgM to IgG or IgA which results in the maintenance of vigorous IgM responses may have significant proinflammatory consequences.Correlation between the levels of plasma and intestinal IgG and IgA specific for microbial and food antigens CD4 T cell count and plasma levels of sCD14.

CD8 T cell but not CD4 T cell activation positively correlated with plasma sCD14 levels p  0.03.

Corroborating previous studies we show that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 T cell counts display a decrease in both absolute and normalized levels of circulating IgG and a decrease in normal- ized levels of circulating IgA specific to LPS derived from E. coli and S. typhi.

In intestinal secretions ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals displayed a profound increase of levels of total IgM .Protein microarray of plasma humoral responses to antigens derived from intestinal microbiota indicates reduced systemic IgG responses to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes but not Bacteroidetes in HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 T cell countTo investigate a wide range of humoral immune responses to intestinal microbiota in sys- temic circulation we developed a novel protein microarray based on protein antigens derived from microbiota shown to be immunogenic in mice and humans .

Furthermore this study demonstrates that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 T cell counts exhibit reduced levels of plasma IgG specific to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.
