reduced levels of microbiota- specific igg and iga may facilitate transepithelial translocation and systemic dissemination of mucosal microbial antigens and contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in hiv-1-infected individuals.resultshiv-1 infection is associated with a significant increase in total igg and iga levels in plasma and igm levels in intestinal secretionsto analyze the levels of total and antigen-specific antibodies in systemic circulation and muco- sal secretions in hiv-1 infection plasma rectal wash and saliva samples were collected from 63 hiv-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy art 9 individuals not receiving art who displayed open viremia non-controllers nc viral load 3420-263000 hiv-1 rna copies per ml of blood 9 individuals spontaneously controlling viremia at low levels despite the absence of art viral controllers vc viral load  1150 hiv-1 rna copies per ml of blood and 25 hiv-1-seronegative controls study cohort characteristics are listed in .

within this context we addressed a whether the levels of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens encoun- tered at mucosal surfaces are altered in hiv-1-infected individuals with varying cd4 t cell counts b whether the humoral responses to these antigens are differentially affected depend- ing on the compartment systemic versus mucosal antigen type bacterial food and yeast and predominant isotype of the antibody and c whether a systemic expansion of antibodies to mucosal antigens significantly contributes to the hyperglobulinemia observed in hiv-1- infected individuals.we present evidence of a significant increase of igm levels and a decrease of iggigm and igaigm ratios of antibodies specific to mucosal microbial antigens in intestinal secretions of antiretroviral therapy art -treated hiv-1-infected individuals indicative of a lack of help for class switch recombination.

in art-treated individuals the correlations between igaigm ratios and cd4 t cell counts did not reach statistical significance although a similar trend was observed.correlation between the levels of plasma and intestinal igg and iga specific for microbial and food antigens plasma scd14 and t and b cell activationconsistent with previous reports we observed a significant increase of markers of microbial translocation scd14 and lps in plasma of hiv-1-infected patients with high inter-individ- ual variability .

in hiv-1-infected individuals with low cd4 t cell counts significantly reduced plasma igg level to flagellin f2 was detected confirming the results of the protein microarray assay the decrease of igg specific to cbir1 has not reached statistical significance.in intestinal secretions art-treated hiv-1-infected individuals displayed a robust increase in levels of igm specific to all types of mucosal antigens .

in intestinal secretions art-treated hiv-1-infected individuals displayed a profound increase of levels of total igm .protein microarray of plasma humoral responses to antigens derived from intestinal microbiota indicates reduced systemic igg responses to proteobacteria and firmicutes but not bacteroidetes in hiv-1-infected individuals with low cd4 t cell countto investigate a wide range of humoral immune responses to intestinal microbiota in sys- temic circulation we developed a novel protein microarray based on protein antigens derived from microbiota shown to be immunogenic in mice and humans .

how- ever the precise nature of the underlying causes of the observed effects warrants further investigation in future studies addressing in detail the effect of hiv-1 infection of class- switching mechanisms in mucosal b cells.the apparent defect in ig isotype switching from igm to igg or iga which results in the maintenance of vigorous igm responses may have significant proinflammatory consequences.correlation between the levels of plasma and intestinal igg and iga specific for microbial and food antigens cd4 t cell count and plasma levels of scd14.

while an increase of igaigm and iggigm isotype ratios of total antibodies was observed in plasma of hiv-1 subjects compared to seronegative controls a sharp decrease of these ratios was identified in a rectal wash of hiv-1-infected subjects with  200 cd4 tigaigm and iggigm ratios specific for antigens derived from intestinal microbiota are significantly decreased in intestinal secretions of hiv-1-infected individuals.

there was no significant association between the total or specific antibody levels and age or gender of the participants.levels of microbial and food-specific antibodies normalized to total ig level of the respective isotypeexpression of specific antibody levels in terms of absolute concentration is affected by high variabilities in the levels of total ig in various secretions .

corroborating previous studies we show that hiv-1-infected individuals with low cd4 t cell counts display a decrease in both absolute and normalized levels of circulating igg and a decrease in normal- ized levels of circulating iga specific to lps derived from e. coli and s. typhi.

furthermore this study demonstrates that hiv-1-infected individuals with low cd4 t cell counts exhibit reduced levels of plasma igg specific to antigens derived from proteobacteria and firmicutes.

in addition we show that the decrease is not specific to lps since the absolute levels of plasma igg to flagellin f2 and normalized levels of igg and iga to flagellins f2 and cbir1 were lower in hiv-1- infected volunteers and .the mucosal lymphoid tissue is the site of induction isotype switch recombination and somatic hypermutation of b cells producing secretory iga that consequently limits the penetra- tion of microbial and food antigens through the intestinal epithelium    .

although the presented data indicate reduced competence of mucosal b cells for class switch recombination from igm to other isotypes the effect of hiv-1 infection on specific class-switching mechanism was not directly addressed.however the presented findings are consistent with earlier studies describing b cell distur- bances in galt of hiv-1-infected individuals and siv-infected macaques including intestinal b cell hyperactivity destruction of gastrointestinal germinal centers in acute phase of infection and specific blocking of intrafollicular but not extrafollicular ig switch enzyme activation- induced deaminase     .in summary decreased capacity of mucosal b cells to respond to newly occurring microbial variants due to the block of class switch recombination described here may facilitate trans-epi- thelial translocation and systemic dissemination of microbial antigens in hiv-1-infected indi- viduals.

although the precise mechanisms underlying the observed reduction of iggigm and igaigm ratios of antibodies specific to mucosal microbial anti- gens and increase in intestinal igm levels are presently unclear and are most likely multifac- torial the presented results are consistent with a lack of cd4 t cell help for class switch recombination from igm to other isotypes .
