andspecification of adequate benchmarking indicators for automatic and continual policy evaluation and rapid review and of appropriate patient provider and payer incentives for achieving set healthcare objectives.the dmc's role in reducing inequity and costs and increasing efficiency and quality of service delivery in healthcare systemsas alluded to in the introduction over the past decades considerable effort has been invested in controlling healthcare costs and in parallel improving service per- formance and quality.

newhouse 1996 rice and smith 2001. as the uncertainty in risk adjustment concerning the variability of service provision efficiency is virtually non-existent due to the ncic-determined standardiza- tion of i clinical validation of dmc smart machinesin- struments and ii routine clinical diagnoses and procedures across all dmcs dmc-based healthcare ser- vice expenditure variability instead will be primarily based on predictable costs for the operation overhead of the dmcs and the considerably more accurate pre- dictability of patient utilization and expenditure patterns.risk-adjusted capitated payment a prospective pay-ment per head patient based on their predictedutilization needs for a given healthcare services basket within a specified period has been successful in trans- ferring financial risk budget responsibility from payers to healthcare providers with a view as mentioned above to control costs and achieve improved performance and quality.

this in turn will stimulate advances in and increase the capabilities of the new healthcare cluster and thereby the entire healthcare system and facilitate progress towards sustainability.discussionwe present here a concept and roadmap to significantly improve exploitation of informational technical financial and human capital healthcare resources.

to attain a sustainable healthcare model fundamental system-wide improvements that effec- tively network and ensure fulfilment of potential synergies between sectors and include and facilitate coherent strategic planning and organisation of healthcare infrastructure are needed.

we propose cre- ation of a new healthcare cluster to be embedded in existing healthcare systems.

as healthcare resources are limited improving healthcare systems' performance i.e.

contain and reduce costs and incentivize increased efficiency quality of healthcare delivery and improved access for patientsa healthcare costs continue to rise and their financial sus- tainability in high-income countries and affordability to establish and improve adequate coverage in low- and middle-income countries remain important issues seee.g.

2013 and of microbial biotechnology see some examples of highly relevant research and innovations in this issue are in our opinion key facilitators to significantly and sustain- ably enhance performance across the entire healthcare sector and importantly at the point of access.towards a solutionto significantly improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare delivery we contend that future evolutionthis is primarily attempted by tightly managing and coordinating care at the provider level sharing financial risk e.g.

to this end we propose creation of a new three-component healthcare cluster seamlessly integrated and intelligently networked to be incorporated in existing healthcare infrastructure.the new triad fig.

this will in turn rebalance and focus primary health services' workloads and expertise physi- cians will be able to concentrate on tasks requiring their advanced training complement their services through access to comprehensive personalized patient data sets and latest intervention recommendations see below and will benefit from a reduction of routine documenta- tion and administrative tasks.national clinical informatics centre ncicthe ncic is the national healthcare information and anal- ysis centre housing the healthcare cloud.

the healthcare cloud is the patient data warehouse that collects and stores in a standardized and secure format all clinically relevant data received from multiple entities such as dmcs and other primary secondary and tertiary healthcare providers biomedical research institutions public health authorities and smart monitoring devices see fig.

healthcare system organization can vary significantly from country to country but in all countries healthcare resources are limited oecd 2015b.

a variety of mechanisms exist to incentivize fru- gal healthcare resource consumption by patients and more importantly service provision by healthcare provi- ders while preservingimproving coverage and quality of services.
