However despite recent progress the degree to which soil microbial com- munity characteristics control Arctic CH4 emissions remains alarmingly unclear.In the research presented here the relationship between the soil microbial community soil chemistry and PMP are investigated at two remote sites on the Alaska North Slope representing two distinct Arctic bioclimate subzones Raynolds et al.

Furthermore b-diversity of Arctic soil microbes is related to soil pH Chu et al.

However reduction of Fe31 to Fe21 can increase soil pH thereby alleviating inhibition of methano- genesis associated with soil acidity Tang et al.

This is in spite of the fact that the soil micro- bial community is predicted to be severely impacted by a warming climate Singh et al.

2013 and there is a general shift in dominance in the methanogen community from Methano- bacteriacea to Methanosarcinacea with decreasing microbial a-diversity and increasing soil depth Frank-Fahle et al.

This work builds on previous research done in Barrow Alaska representing the remain- ing Arctic bioclimate subzone on the Alaska North Slope and lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive under- standing of soil microbial CH4 cycling across the entire North Slope region Lipson et al.

Additionally this work investigates soils from two remote sites that have only recently begun being studied using soil chamber methods Davidson et al.

Both sites are in the footprint of eddy-c ovariance towers that continuously measure CH4 flux net eco- system exchange NEE and a variety of additional soil and meteorological parameters Zona et al.

Colour figure can be viewed at Microbial communityMicrobial diversity has been previously linked to soil pH Fierer and Jackson 2006 Chu et al.

which agrees with previous findings showing that soil acetate concentrations are unconnected to Arctic methane production Hines et al.
