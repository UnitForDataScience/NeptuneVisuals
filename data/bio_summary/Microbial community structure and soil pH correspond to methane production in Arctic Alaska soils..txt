Environmental Microbiology 2017 198 3398-3410doi10.11111462-2920.13854Microbial community structure and soil pH correspond to methane production in Arctic Alaska soilsRobert Wagner Donatella Zona Walter Oechel and David LipsonSan Diego State University Biology San Diego CA USA.SummaryWhile there is no doubt that biogenic methane pro- duction in the Arctic is an important aspect of global methane emissions the relative roles of microbial community characteristics and soil environmental conditions in controlling Arctic methane emissions remains uncertain.

S3J K and L. Species evenness was significantly correlated with PMP for the whole microbial community p 5 0.01 R2 5 0.55 the methanogens p 5 0.003R2 5 0.5 and the FeRB p 5 0.03 R2 5 0.3 though notfor the aerobic methanotrophs p 5 0.72 R2 5 0.18 Supporting Information Fig.

S1H.Total percent abundances of microbial groupsOn average there was a higher percent abundance of methanogens p 5 0.02 and FeRB p 5 0.003 in Atqa- suk than Ivotuk though there was no significant difference in methanotrophs between sites p 5 0.1 Fig.

The dominant estimated pressure change sampling occurs evenly across all incubations.Species a- and b-diversityThe microbial community in Atqasuk had a significantly higher Shannon p 5 0.001 and Simpson p 5 0.002 species diversity than in Ivotuk though rarefied species richness was not significantly different between sites p 5 0.08 Fig.

These results indicate that the effect of FeRB on methanogenesis in these soils is probably through a greater role of dominant rather than rare FeRB species and that species evenness of this group is an important characteristic.Taken together this study reveals relationships between patterns of microbial diversity microbial community struc- ture and methane production in Arctic soils and lends support for the notion that community diversity or func- tional groups each taken alone may be insufficient to adequately describe relationships between the biological community and ecosystem processes Hector et al.

S2.Potential methane production and potential anaerobic respirationMean PMP in Atqasuk 1.54 nmoles-h21-cm23 was a little over double that in Ivotuk 0.72 nmoles-h21-cm23 p 5 0.007 and increased with depth at both sites though the depth relationship was only marginally significant in Atqa- suk p 5 0.06 Fig.

Across both sites Geobacter increased with soil depth p 5 0.01 while a decrease was observed in Anaeromyxobacter p 5 0.03 and Shewanella p 5 0.002 Supporting Information Fig.
