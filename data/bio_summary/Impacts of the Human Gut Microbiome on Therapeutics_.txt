Because the gut microbiome varies markedly among individuals host-drug interactions mediated by microbial metabolism warrant close consideration in tailoring patient treatment.Studying drug cometabolism by the gut microbiota and the human host is complicated by interindividual variability in human genetics diet and other clinical factors.

mouth skin airways and urogenital tract have distinct microbiomes from the gut microbiome but the gut has been most studied in terms of drug response in part because it contains by far the greatest microbial biomass in the human body and therefore the greatest capacity for drug metabolism.

Nutrition contributes significantly to the gut microbiome and the gut microbiome plays an important role in human metabolism.

Although differences in the microbiome have not been linked to CYP450 activity in humans accurate prediction of drug metabolism may ul- timately require knowledge of both human CYP450 and the gut microbiota genetics as one of the functional roles of the gut is to partially digest and absorb nutrients and therefore is a ma- jor component of metabolism.

Figure motivated by figure 1 in Reference 124.Such dynamic systems thinking is common in ecology and although many current microbiome research techniques stem from this discipline its application remains relatively rare in medicine.In this review we focus on the human gut microbiome although where appropriate we refer to studies using animal models especially gnotobiotic mice germ-free mice colonized with a defined set of microbes either pure strains or fecal material from a rodent or human donor.

As far back as the 1970s it was estimated that the number of microbial cells mostly bacteria associated with the human body was greater than the number of human cells carrying the human genome 1.

It is perhaps most useful to think of the microbiome as a dynamic system that affects how drugs are metabolized these products of metabolism in turn change the microbiome which then changes future responses even to the same pharmaceutical.Circadian clock alterationsGut-brain axis Conn et al.
