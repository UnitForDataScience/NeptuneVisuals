For example a previous study found that more than 40 unique ARGs comprising nine gene families were transferred between human and farm isolates In our large scale bacterial genome data mining analysis ARGs were found exchanged the most frequently between animal and human bacteria followed by between animal and aquatic bacteria and then between animal and terrestrial bacteria emphasizing the contributing role of animals in disseminating ARGs Other studies also revealed the specific transfer of ARGs or ARG-carrying bacteria from urban and hospital wastewater to aquatic environment manure to soil between food animals and humansetc.The dissemination pathway of ARGs or ARG-carryingbacteria involves different aspects including direct path- way and indirect pathway comprising various sectors and settings 11.

In fact ARGs have been verified to be ancient in the natural environments for example even in 30 000-year old frozen sediments In recent years ARGs have been character- ized throughout microbiomes of natural and host-asso- ciated environments by metagenomic function-based or sequence-based strategies Accordingly a new term antibiotic resistome has been coined to refer to the collection of ARGs in a specific bacteria or ecological niche The antibiotic resistance is therefore not only a public health concern but also an ecological issue with respect to environment animal and human.

For example due to the contain- ing of human and animal pathogens and industrial pollutions like antibiotics and disinfectants sewage waste- water released constantly in human activities contributes greatly to the spread and accumulation of ARGs in water environment In addition the heavyTable 1 Representative studies characterizing the antibiotic resistomeSample sourceMethodTargetPerspectiveconclusionReferencePermafrost sedimentsPCR assay and sequencingARGs encoding TetM VanXAAC3 Bla and ErmAntibiotic resistance is natural and predates the modern use antibioticsSoilFunctional screening ofmetagenomic DNA librariesARGs encoding resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics tetracycline and nalidixic acidThe soil bacteria are a reservoir of ARGs with greater genetic diversitySoilIsolating resistance bacteriaScreening 480 strains against 21 antibiotics encompassingall major bacterial targetsSoil bacteria are a reservoir of resistance determinants that can be potentially transferred into other microbial communitySwine farm fecal samplesQuantitative PCR arrays149 unique resistance genesSpecific ARGs are enriched infarm samples.

Tetracycline resistance genes are the most abundant in human gut microbiomeThe bacterial mobile ARGs are mainly present in four bacterial phyla and are significantly enriched in Proteobacteria.Bacterial phylogeny is the major driving force for the transfer of mobile ARGsuse of prophylactic antibiotics in aquiculture for example fish rearing results in the frequent occurrence of antibiotic- resistant bacteria and a rapid dissemination of the antibiotic resistance determinants in water environment The ARGs have been widely explored in water environments including sewage hospital and animal production waste- waters ground water surface water drinking water and so on which has been summarized elsewhere The most frequently encountered ARGs in these environments are tet genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines aac aph and ant genes to aminoglycosides and a variety of bla genes to b-lactams.

Though numerous ARGs are found among natural and host-associated environments the real risk of these ARGs has been considered to be over-estimated The mobile ARGs that can be disseminated through HGT among bacteria are generally considered to have a higher risk for the transfer of antibiotic resistance.

Another study further demonstrated that antibiotics can serve as a sole carbon source to support the growth of soil bacteria and many of the phylogeneti- cally diverse bacteria are found closely related to human pathogens and resistant to multiple antibiotics Soil bacteria have also been found to share the same perfect nucleotide identity ARGs with diverse human pathogens Of 110 ARGs identified 18 showed perfect amino acid identity to those in GenBank and 55 of the 110 genes were b-lactamase encoding genes.

they found the marine environments host a diversity of ARGs conferring resistance to ampicillin tetracycline nitrofurantoin and sulfadimethoxine and nearly 30 of these genes are known ARGs while the majority are new resistance genes that have never been classified.

detected 149 unique ARGs using quantitative PCR the top 63 ARGs of which were enriched 192-fold median up to 28 000-fold maximum compared with respective control samples The three major resistance mechanisms detected in these farms are efflux pumps antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection.

There are many other studies showing an increased number of resistant bacteria in animal farming environments - and the ARGs have even been frequently found in a small fecal metagenomic library from organic pigs that were reared in an antibiotic-free environment In a very recent study the reference gene catalog of pig gut microbiome was established The ARG analysis indicated that ARGs encoding resistance to bacitracin cephalosporin macrolide streptogramin B and tetracy- cline are prevalent among pigs from different countries and the country-specific farm systems and antibiotic use strategies obviously affect the pig gut antibiotic resistome.
