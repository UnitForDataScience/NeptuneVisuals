fecal microbiota trans- fer fmt has proven to be an effective way to transfer healthy microbiota that may have beneficial effects on metabolism and the immune system in recipient mice fmt has also been used in patients with colitis and recently in cancer patients we recently demonstrated that fmt could restore the gut microbiota and rebalance the gut hemeostasis which in turns delayed diabetes onset in nod mice in other disease mod- els including obesity the gut microbiota have been shown to contribute to generation of the metabolic syndrome fmt from lean mice to obese mice can ameliorate the metabolic syndrome in the obese mice due to the rebalancing of gut microbiota treating metabolic syndrome with fmt has also been tested in humans the beneficial effects of fmt have been particularly used in patients suffering from clostridium difficile infection although antibiotic treatment has been the mainstay of treat- ment of clostridium difficile infection some patients have developed recurrent infection later on and importantly antibiotic treatment for other medical conditions can lead to persistent infection with clostridium difficile since the clinical trial on fmt in patients with recurrent clostridium difficile infection consid- erable progress has been made in this field including formulation ofthe microbiota and delivery route of the bacteria.

the insulin- producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets are damaged and destroyed by activated autoreactive t cells resulting in disor- dered blood glucose regulation this destruction is the result of a complex interaction between genetic susceptibility genes and environmental factors genetic screening has shown that cer- tain major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii genes also called human leukocyte antigen hla genes dqa10301 dq2 dqb10302 dq8 drb1dr301 dr3 and a number of dr4 alleles corresponding author.e-mail address l. wen.are associated with susceptibility to t1d in patients how- ever only a small portion of individuals carrying those alleles will develop t1d yet a sharp rise of t1d incidence has been seen in recent years in a time frame that is not sufficient for genetic change indicating that environmental factors may play a crucial role in diabetes development prenatal influence viral infec- tions dietary factors in the young as well as hygiene can all affect the disease onset more recently several studies have shown commensal microbiota to be connected with the development of this autoimmune disease although triggering factors for t1d have not yet been clearly identified the gut microbiota are believed to play an important role in the development of the disease the gut microbiota are associated with the development of several diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes liver disorders intestinal inflammatory syndromes allergic diseases disorders in the central nervous system and1043-6618c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.especially autoimmune diseases we and others have recently reported that alteration of gut microbiota by pharmaco- logical means can protect from or accelerate t1d development in non-obese diabetic nod mice a well established animal model for t1d research we were among the first to demonstrate that the gut micro- biota shape the nod mouse innate immune system myd88 is a central adaptor in most innate immune toll-like receptor signaling pathways and myd88-deficient nod mice do not develop autoim- mune diabetes in a clean but not sterile housing environment however germ-free myd88-deficient mice develop full-blown dia- betes this indicates that commensal bacteria especially gut bacteria play a very important role in triggering the autoimmune disease.

it should be noted that long-term antibiotic treatment could cause resistant bacteria to propagate in the gut protective bacteria that arise from pharmacological alteration of gut microbiota in early lifethe colonization of gut microbiota is strongly influenced by microbial exposure at birth when antibiotic treatment is used to study the effect of gut microbiota on disease it is clear that the timing of administration duration of treatment as well as the type of antibiotic used must be taken into account.

2. how do antibiotics affect pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity gut microbiota composition is altered after antibiotic nps treatment and antigen presenting cells exposed to the altered bacteria in the gut display impaired antigen presenting ability to cd8 t cells which in turn alleviate insulitis in the pancreas and protect the host from diabetes development.apc function could be the result of direct contact between apcs and gut microbiota in the gut or indirect contact mediated by metabo- lites from altered gut microbiota.

in this review we discuss recent findings in relation to the microbiota particularly in the context of type 1 diabetes.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.contentsgut microbiota and type 1 diabetestype 1 diabetes t1d is a t cell-mediated autoimmune metabolic disease which is commonly seen in children and young adults although it can also present in older adults.

alterations in intestinal permeability allow access of bacterial toxin infectious agents and dietary antigens from the lumen to mucosal immune elements another possible mechanism is some bacterial products share the molecular homology with islet autoantigens and the islet beta cells are attacked by the immune cells that are reactive to the bactierial antigens autoantibodies have been observed in t1d patients as young as several months old animal model studies have also shown that alteration of gut microbiota early in life and gut permeabil- ity are important in shaping the host immune system especially at the prenatal or neonatal stages.efforts have been made to investigate which bacteria in the gut may be beneficial or harmful in the development of t1d researchers have studied altered gut microbiota in experimental mice after treating with a combination of 4 antibiotics including ampicillin metronidazole neomycin and vancomycin although there are studies using germ-free gf mice to test whether one or more species of bacteria introduced into the mice has an impact on diabetes development which species are probiotic and which are detrimental have not beenfig.

in a clinical study a 4-day treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics vancomycin gentamicin and meropenem significantly shifted the gut microbiota composition but this did not have a clinical impact in respect of metabolic markers such as glucose tolerance or insulin secretion however in a study by endesfelder and coauthors a change of gut microbiota occurring as a result of dietary change had an impact on islet autoimmunity.

they identified a subgroup of chil- dren where bacteroides was dominant with low akkermansia in the gut microbiota and this was associated with early introduction of a non-milk diet lower abundance of genes for the production ofbutyrate and early autoantibody development they postu- lated that low butyrate generation by the bacteria contributed to increased risk of the development of islet autoantibodies it is clear that the effect of gut microbiota on host immune responses early in life is much stronger than later in life.

l. goodfellowii is a member of fusobacteria and expresses a protein peptide sharing a homolo- gous sequence with igrp and its abundance is correlated with the progression of diabetes this is the first evidence of molecular mimicry that relates to a bacterial antigen in initiation of diabetes onset due to t cell cross-reactivity to the microbial peptide and leading to an activated autoimmune response.fecal microbiota transfer fmt as a potential therapygut bacterial composition may be altered by diet antibiotics probiotics or by direct microbiota transfer.

although fmt has not been used in t1d treatment if specific combinations of beneficial bac- teria could be identified this could be a promising therapy given that fecal filtrate has a similar efficacy to fecal microbiota in treat- ing other medical conditions however more comprehensive studies need to be performed to understand what bacterium or bacteria and metabolites can trigger the imbalance of immune system at early-life in humans at high-risk of developing t1d.perspectives and conclusionit is clear that many factors can affect the composition of gut microbiota which modulate the immune system contributing to health or disease including t1d.

probiotics and other strategies altering the gut microbiota including fmt could be a promising approach to modulate gut microbiota and rebalance the homeosta- sis of mucosal and systemic immune systems.

many factors may influence the composition of the microbiota such as mode of birth diet infec- tions and medication including antibiotics.

in diseases with a multifactorial etiology like type 1 diabetes manipulation and alterations of the microbiota in animal models have been shown to influence the incidence and onset of disease.
