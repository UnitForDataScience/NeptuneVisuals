In addition equol production in the gut produces the beneficial effects of soy and isoflavones on menopausal symptoms and gut microbiota is associated with equol production in the gut from soy-isoflavone concentrates in post-menopausal women Thus the changes of gut microbiota composition can prevent the meno- pausal symptoms.Diets including prebiotics and probiotics can modulate gut microbiota  Probiotics consumption seems to be a feasible approach to modulate the intestinal microbiota and to maintain or restore human health Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus natural components of the colon micro- biota are the most commonly used probiotics in many func- tional foods and dietary supplements.

fermentum which was isolated from human milk can inhibit pathogens decrease cholesterol synthesis and change gut microbiota Dietary supplemen- tation with prebiotics including lactulose galacto- oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides increases the contents and proportion of bifidobacteria in the intestines and improves nutrient absorption pre- vents gut inflammation and stimulates energy and glu- cose metabolism  Synbiotics a combination of probiotics and prebiotics may have better efficacy for changing gut microbiota and to improving metabolic symptoms However there are still some debates about consumption of prebiotics and probiotics gut microbiota and metabolic efficacy.Cauliflower mushroom Sparassis crispa Wulf.Fr.

The present study showed some beneficial synbiotic effects of CFM and LFE in an estrogen-deficient animal model.Probiotics and prebiotics can change gut microbiota but neither of them consistently changes gut microbiota effi- ciently and synbiotics a mixture of probiotics and prebi- otics may be more effective for making beneficial changes to the gut microbiota 34.

Therefore the synbiotics CFM and LFE can be a potential therapeutic agent for menopausal symptoms in post-menopausal women.AbbreviationsAMPK AMP kinase AUCG Area under the curve of glucose AUCI Area under the curve of insulin BMD Bone mineral density CFLF 1 CFM plus 0.1 LFE CFM Cauliflower mushroom plus 0.1 casein DEXA Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer En Energy percent ER Estrogen receptor GSK-3b Glycogen synthase-3b HOMA-IR Homeostasis model assessment estimate of insulin resistance IL-1b Interleukin-1b IPITT Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test LFE 0.1 L. fermentum plus 1 dextrin MCP-1 Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 OGTT Oral glucose tolerance testOVX Ovariectomy PEPCK Phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase PKBAkt Protein kinase B TNF-a Tumor necrosis factor-a VCO2 Average carbon dioxide production VO2 Average oxygen consumptionFundingThis study was supported by a grant from Traditional Culture Convergence Research Program through the National Research Foundation of KoreaNRF funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT NRF- 2016M3C1B5907152 and the Business for Cooperative RD between Industry Academy and Research Institute funded Korea Small and Medium Business Administration.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article.Authors' contributionsSP and SYJ participated in the experimental design SK and NRL conducted the animal studies SYJ performed biochemical studies.

Therefore CFLF but not CFM was sufficient for protecting against menopausal symptoms.Early studies of the gut microbiomes concentrated on selectively stimulating the growth of a limited number ofTable 4 Gut microbiomes unit countsValues represented means - standard deviation n  5Different letters represent a significant difference in Tukey test at p  0.05CFM 1 water extract of cauliflower mushroom LFE 0.1 L. fermentum CFLF 1 water extract of cauliflower mushroom 0.1 L. fermentum positive-control30 mgkg body weight 17b-estradiol1The ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroideteshealth-promoting bacteria the application of prebiotics was focused on improving host welfare However the applications of synbiotics have recently progressed to the alleviation of metabolic diseases Some studies have reported that synbiotics have beneficial effects on obesity and metabolic syndrome in human clinical studies and synbiotics are somewhat better than individual effects on conditions such as obesity ethanol-induced hep- atic steatosis and inflammation-related diseases The present study also definitively demonstrated that syn- biotics had much better efficacy for improving menopausal symptoms than either CFM or LFE alone.

The present study suggested that OVX changes gut microbiota and the changes are associated with menopausal symptoms but that the synbiotics CFM and LFE can prevent many of the gut microbiota changes and menopausal symptoms in estrogen-deficient animals.

They were lower in both CFM and LFE than the control group and CFLF synergistic- ally decreased then to similar levels as the positive- control group Table Energy metabolismThe OVX-control group had higher body weights than the positive-control group and CFLF prevented its in- crease in OVX rats Table As a result final body weight was greater in the OVX-control group than the positive-control group but CFLF also lowered final body weight but it was not significantly different from the OVX-control or positive-control groups Table Peri- uterine fat and retroperitoneum fat mass the visceral fat mass was much greater in OVX-control group than the positive-control group.

OVX-control rats had lower insulin sensi- tivity and 17b-estradiol but CFM and CFLF improved the insulin sensitivity.Hepatic insulin signalingThe phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3b were much lower in the control group than in the positive-control and it increased in the ascending order of control CFM LFE CFLF and positive-control Fig.
