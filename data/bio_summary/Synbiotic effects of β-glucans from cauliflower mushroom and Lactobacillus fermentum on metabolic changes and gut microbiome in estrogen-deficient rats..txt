ovx-control rats had lower insulin sensi- tivity and 17b-estradiol but cfm and cflf improved the insulin sensitivity.hepatic insulin signalingthe phosphorylation of akt and gsk-3b were much lower in the control group than in the positive-control and it increased in the ascending order of control cfm lfe cflf and positive-control fig.

the present study showed some beneficial synbiotic effects of cfm and lfe in an estrogen-deficient animal model.probiotics and prebiotics can change gut microbiota but neither of them consistently changes gut microbiota effi- ciently and synbiotics a mixture of probiotics and prebi- otics may be more effective for making beneficial changes to the gut microbiota 34. probiotics prebiotics and syn- biotics have mainly been reported to improve bowel-related diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer in addition a leaky gut may deliver toxins antigens or bacteria into the liver and may play a pathogenic role in liver damage in this aspect gut microbiota may play an important role by improving intestinal barriers.

homa-ir was lower in cfm and lfe than in ovx-control and it was lowest in cflf among all the groups table ovx-control rats had higher serum glucose concentra- tions that continued to increase until 60 min after glucose challenge and then slowly decreased in comparison to the positive-control rats indicating that the ovx-control rats had increased insulin resistance fig.

in addition equol production in the gut produces the beneficial effects of soy and isoflavones on menopausal symptoms and gut microbiota is associated with equol production in the gut from soy-isoflavone concentrates in post-menopausal women thus the changes of gut microbiota composition can prevent the meno- pausal symptoms.diets including prebiotics and probiotics can modulate gut microbiota  probiotics consumption seems to be a feasible approach to modulate the intestinal microbiota and to maintain or restore human health bifidobacterium and lactobacillus natural components of the colon micro- biota are the most commonly used probiotics in many func- tional foods and dietary supplements.

fermentum which was isolated from human milk can inhibit pathogens decrease cholesterol synthesis and change gut microbiota dietary supplemen- tation with prebiotics including lactulose galacto- oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides increases the contents and proportion of bifidobacteria in the intestines and improves nutrient absorption pre- vents gut inflammation and stimulates energy and glu- cose metabolism  synbiotics a combination of probiotics and prebiotics may have better efficacy for changing gut microbiota and to improving metabolic symptoms however there are still some debates about consumption of prebiotics and probiotics gut microbiota and metabolic efficacy.cauliflower mushroom sparassis crispa wulf.fr.

since l. fermentum tol- erates acid environments and 3 gl of bile salts it is found to survive in the intestines and it can act as a probiotic al- though l. fermentum does not use dietary fiber l. fer- mentum is safe up to a level of 1010 cfukg body weight day during 2-4 weeks of treatment in animals and it has also been shown to be safe in infant formulas in 1-6-month old infants it enables harmful intestinal bacterial enzymes to be inhibited decreases pathogenic bacterial populations and increases beneficial bacterial populations interestingly l. fermentum was first isolated from healthy elderly koreans and it has the strongest binding to intestinal epithelial cells and has potent immune- enhancing anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative and anti- dyslipidemia activities and reverses alcohol-induced liver dis- eases  these studies suggest that l. fermentum is a beneficial probiotic in humans.
