The main idea of data augmentation method is that instead of working with the intractable posterior density Th  it is convenient to work with Th O  where O is the missinglatent data in the model.

In the case when a model involves latent or miss- ing data one can employ data augmentation techniques pro- posed by Tanner and Wong 1987.

The type I error rates are estimated using the pro- portion of data sets for which the null hypothesis was falsely rejected i.e.

For example in simulation 1 with MAF0.2 and 2  0.2 the power to detect the continuous covariate effect is 30.8 when1  0.05 and increases to 99.5 when 1  0.15.Parameter estimations of the modelTables 1 and 2 show the true value the mean estimates and the root mean square errors RMSEs of the parameters computed from 1000 independently replicated data sets inT A BLE 2 Summary of parameter estimation results for simulation2 with 2  0.2 and MAF0.2 from 1000 replications Parameters True Estimation RMSE Fixed effects Direct on counts 3200030000 Direct on SZ  On 3310.50.5500.122 Indirect  On SZ 2800026000On 3311.0700.167NBNBZINBZINB NB ZINBNB ZINB ZINBNB NB NBTruey1 mis-specified y2 mis-specified y3 mis-specified Random effect covariance Response level for counts 2FIGURE 2 The distribution of DICs for the true and misspecified models112LV levelOverdispersion  322S0.10.1090.0750.20.1600.069probability of structural zeros 2 as well as for the variance of serial random effects on the LV3 s i.e.

The misspecified models misspecified distributions are indicated in bold we have investigated include the fitting of ZINB NB ZINBNB ZINB ZINB or NB NB NB distributions to the data corresponding to the misspecifications of 1 2 and3 respectively.

The trace plots of the regression coefficient of age on the three OTUs are shown in supplemen- tary Figure S9 and the scatter plots of the predicted expected means of the three investigated genus versus ages are shown in Figure 3.We also apply sensitivity analysis assuming that SMB53 has zero inflation and fit the data using a multivariate NB NB ZINB distribution for the joint modeling of UCG Clostridium SMB53.

The red solid line is the smooth spline best-fitted line for the expected mean of second measured samples with df  2 and the two red dotted curves represent the confidence bands surrounding the best fitconsequence when a nonzero inflated data set is fitted by zero inflated models Min  Agresti 2005 Xu et al.
