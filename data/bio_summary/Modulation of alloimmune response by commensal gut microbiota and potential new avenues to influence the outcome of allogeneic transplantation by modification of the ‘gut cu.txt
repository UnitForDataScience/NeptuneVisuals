the purpose of this broad review was to exam- ine as to how this initial association of immunology and microbiology has come to a complete circle in terms of relationship between i the microbes and protective immune responses ii influences of the commensal microbiota on immune homeostasis andiii modulation of the alloimmune response by com- mensal microbiota iv alloimmune responses gener- ated by cross-reactivity between microbial and hla antigens.a very recent review by rouse  mueller 2016 alluded to this issue by their statement that 'microbes at mucosal surface sites can influence systemic immune responses to many antigens that include viral infec- tions and vaccines' caballero  pamer 2015. an in- depth review on this topic termed as 'transkingdom' metagenomics is given by pfeiffer  virgin 2016.we expect our immune system to defend us against pathogenic microbes to prevent the growth and expansion of tumour cells to eliminate abnormal or dead cells or immune complexes - many of which are accomplished by our natural immune system.

oral treatment of mice with purified psa pro- tects recipients from weight loss decreases levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnfa il-17 and il-23 and inhibits epithelial hyperplasia and neutrophil infiltration to the gut associated with disease induc- tion in these models.molecular concepts that could help to understand the connection between microbes and alloimmune responsesthere are some molecular concepts that we need to assimilate before we explore the potential use of good and healthy gut microbiota to modulate alloimmune response to prolong the survival of the allograft with reduced alloimmune response and decreased rate of debilitating or life-threatening infections.

2015 are optimistic that a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of the interactions of gut microbiota and alloimmune responses could make gut microbiota a therapeutic target in the future.altering intestinal microbial flora could benefit bmt patientsjenq et al.2012 studied graft-versus-host disease gvhd in murine and human recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation bmt and opined that inflammation of the intestine is secondary to gvhd and is associated with major shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

these antibiotics treatment could tilt the commensal microbiota and that is where the newinsights into the ability of utilizing the potential of microbiota to modulate alloimmune response come to play.healthy microbeswe knew the use of live microorganisms to maintain bowel health and prolong life as early as 1900s june  mazmanian 2009. the term 'probiotics' is used to describe dietary microbes conferring healthy bene- fits.

2015 have already published an excel- lent review after reviewing 112 articles on the effects of mucosal microbiota on alloimmune responses on liver small intestine kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantations and concluded that changes in gut microbial flora are associated with alloimmune responses graft function and immunological rejec- tions.

potential scenarios include polyclonal b-cell activation with enhanced alloimmune response however more studies are required to clarify the pros and cons of vaccinations carried out in the context of allograft transplantation.the conundrum of mucosal floral effects on organs that are associated with mucosa and that are not associated with mucosal florathere is a seminal point to be considered regarding the mucosal microbiota and their influence on allo- graft transplant and alloimmune responses.

the optimism is that we might find more effective ways to manipulate the alloimmune response to enhance the survival of allografts by beingable to alter the microbiota to ameliorate the adverse effects of alloimmune response in allograft transplan- tation.disclosuresthis particular study does not involve any human sub- jects or animals therefore no ethical approval was required.

this review deals with new and emerging data on how the commensal mucosal and skin microbiota influence the immune homeostasis and how manipu- lating the commensal microbiota of the mucosa and skin could influence the survival and long-term func- tions of the allografts.

however most transplants especially solid-organ transplantations are carried out with grafts from hla-mismatched donors based on pre-existing alloimmune status and based on the currently available immunosuppressive agents to reduce immunological injuries to the mis- matched allograft to the minimum and also to avoidrecurrent microbial diseases due to compromised immune system.what is alloimmune responsethis is an immune response towards the antigens of a genetically nonidentical individual alloantigen.

there are two types of alloimmune responses i direct alloimmune response when the host's educated t cells recognize an hlamhc which is present on foreign cells and develop an immune response to get rid of those cells ii indirect alloim- mune response when the host's educated t cells rec- ognize a processed alloantigen presented by the host's cells in the context of the host's hlamhc and develop an immune response to get rid of any cells in the host expressing those recognized antigens.due to shortage of organs available from deceased donors and constraints with willing living related and unrelated donors for medical and social reasons most solid-organ transplants sot are carried out with mismatched donorrecipient pairs.the current ability to detect specific alloantibodies against the potential donor has developed an alloanti- body-based matching for sot.

recent ashi annual meetings have high- lighted the role of intestinal microbiota in alloimmune response and allograft transplantation.

this literature review will focus on this issue and hopes to prompt further discussion within our ashi community to unravel mechanisms of modulation of alloimmune responses and also to start exploring newer strategies to control the undesired alloimmune response follow- ing transplantation with the help of our 'gut culture'.gut-associated lymphoid tissue galt is a power- ful immune induction site.

these kinds of changes could affect the innate and adaptive immune responses including alloimmune responses critical to allograft transplant recipients with respect to the out- come of the graft.potential ways by which the composition of the microbiota modulates allograft rejectionlei et al.
