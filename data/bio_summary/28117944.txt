Pathogen- specific immune assays suggest the relative risk of cer- tain infections however in the face of intensive immunosuppression protective immunity while useful tends to dissipate.Risk of Infection and the Timeline of InfectionThe risk of infection for the recipient at any point in time after transplantation is a function of two factorsThe epidemiologic exposures of the patient and the organ donor including recent nosocomial and remote exposures Table 1 8.The patient's net state of immunosuppression including all factors contributing to the risk of infection Table 2.Table 1 Epidemiologic exposures relevant to transplantation1 VirusHerpes group CMV EBV HHV6 7 8 HSV VZVHepatitis viruses HAV HBV HCV HEVRetroviruses HIV HTLV-1 and 2Others West Nile WNV Chikungunya Zika Dengue lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus rabies BacteriaGram-positive and gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus spp.

Investigative approaches including pathogen-specific immunotherapies and risk stratification based on genetic polymorphisms of immunoregulatory pathways will allow the individualiza- tion of immunosuppression and prophylaxis.DisclosureThe author of this manuscript has no conflicts of interest to disclose as described by the American Journal of Transplantation.ReferencesWojtowicz A Lecompte TD Bibert S et al.
