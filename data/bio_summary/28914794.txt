In the study on the effect of the synbiotic product containing a blend of probiotics Lactobacillus casei Lactobacillus rhamnosus Streptococcus thermophilus Bifidobacterium breve Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium longum Lactobacillus bulgaricus and fructooligosccharides 52 adults participated for 28 weeks.

The effect of a fermented product containing Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 and Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 strains on blood and stool parameters was studied in a randomised double-blind trial on 30 healthy volunteers.

Future studies may explain the mechanisms of actions of those components which may confer a beneficial effect on human health.Acknowledgments We would like to thank the National Centre for Research and Development for the financial support of publication of this paper within the project PBS3A8322015 realized within the framework of the Program of Applied Studies.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesVergin F.

Studies on animals demonstrated that orally administered Lactobacillus acidophilus induces expression of u-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal cells and mediate analgesic functions in the intestine and that the observed effect is comparable to the effect of morphine .

Some products of probiotics' metabolism may also show antibiotic acidophiline bacitracin lactacin anti-cancerogenic and immunosuppressive properties -.Molecular and genetic studies allowed the determination of the basics of the beneficial effect of probiotics involving four mechanismsAntagonism through the production of antimicrobial substances Competition with pathogens for adhesion to the epithelium and for nutrients Immunomodulation of the host Inhibition of bacterial toxin production .The first two mechanisms are directly associated with their effect on other microorganisms.

It was demonstrated that despite the variety of carbohydrates that exhibit the prebiotic activity the effect of their administration is an increased count of beneficial bacteria mostly of the Bifidobacterium genus .The mechanism of a beneficial effect of prebiotics on immunological functions remains unclear.Several possible models have been proposed Prebiotics are able to regulate the action of hepatic lipogenic enzymes by influencing the increased production of short-chain fatty acids SCFAs such as propionic acid.The production of SCFAs especially of butyric acid as a result of fermentation was identified as a modulator of histone acetylation thus increasing the availability of numerous genes for transcription factors.The modulation of mucin production.It was demonstrated that FOS and several other prebiotics cause an increased count of lymphocytes andor leukocytes in gut-associated lymphoid tissues GALTs and in peripheral blood.The increased secretion of IgA by GALTs may stimulate the phagocytic function of intra-inflammatory macrophages.The main aim of prebiotics is to stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract which confers a health benefit on the host.
