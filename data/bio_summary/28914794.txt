In the study on the effect of the synbiotic product containing a blend of probiotics Lactobacillus casei Lactobacillus rhamnosus Streptococcus thermophilus Bifidobacterium breve Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium longum Lactobacillus bulgaricus and fructooligosccharides 52 adults participated for 28 weeks.

The effect of a fermented product containing Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 and Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 strains on blood and stool parameters was studied in a randomised double-blind trial on 30 healthy volunteers.

Studies on animals demonstrated that orally administered Lactobacillus acidophilus induces expression of u-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal cells and mediate analgesic functions in the intestine and that the observed effect is comparable to the effect of morphine .

The effect of fructooligosaccharides SYN1 combined with two probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.

Therefore an appropriate combination of both components in a single product should ensure a superior effect compared to the activity of the probiotic or prebiotic alone .The aim of the review was to discuss the mechanisms of action of probiotics prebiotics and synbiotics as well as the current insight into their effect on human health.
