.genetic adaptation of early bifidobacterial colonizers to the infant guttransmission of bifidobacteria from mother to her child may be possible through ingestion of mother's milk this human fluid represents a bacterial transmission medium that is ideal not only for micro- biota dispersal but also for the provision of nutrients to the initial colonizers of the infant gut human milk is a very rich source of glycans including lactose and human milk oligosaccharides hmos  which represent an important carbon and energy source for pioneering saccharolytic members of the infant gut microbiota in particular bifidobacteria -.

bacteria may reach the mammary gland of the mother and may be transmitted directly to breastfed infants although inversely bifidobacteria may be intro- duced into human milk from the infant's oral cavity during suckling -.notably several studies have highlighted the possibility of vertical transmission of components of the gut microbiota from mother to child  further- more a recent pilot study involving four mother-child pairs revealed direct transmission of bifidobacterial strains from mothers to their newborns using a novel its-based approach although intriguing the bio- logical relevance of such findings in this latter work is limited due to the small number of mother-infant pairs analysed another important component of the gut microbiota is represented by virus-like particles in the git which together constitute the gut virome currently very little is known about the infant virome -al- though the existence and impact of phages specific for bifidobacteria i.e.

notably these data are consistent with current knowledge on bifidobacterial hmohmo-de- rived glycan utilization abilities -interestingly the results of these fermentation profil- ing experiments correspond very well with those pre- dicted from the in silico analyses of the genomes decoded in this study.genome reconstruction of shared bifidobacteria based on in silico analyses of microbiomesin order to verify the occurrence of identical bifidobac- terial strains in the microbiota of an infant's fecal sample and in that of the corresponding milk andor fecal sam- ple of the mother a shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed of three infant samples tvpr-01 tvpr-02 and tvpr-03 for which we observed a high number of potentially vertically transmitted bifidobacterial strains.

this finding suggests the presence of the same bifidophage in both mother and infant microbiome expanding the previ- ous view of bifidobacterial phages multiplying in the infant gut thereby perhaps limiting overgrowth by their bifido- bacterial host .conclusionspassage through the birth canal during delivery and sub- sequent breastfeeding are considered important events that affect microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of the newborn in this study an ngs approach was employed to confirm the existence of a vertical transmission route of bifidobacterial com- munities in 25 mother and newborn pairs.

genomically identical bifidobacterial strains have been isolated from fecal samples of mother and child combinations as well as the corresponding human milk samples indicative of a vertical transmis- sion route from maternal git to breastfed infants 1-. this has given rise to the hypothesis that micro- bial colonization of the infant depends on the mother'sc the authors.

we therefore decided to verify these findings using a cultivation approach where weisolated such strains followed by de novo genome se- quencing of such bifidobacterial isolates.isolation and genome sequencing of shared mother-child bifidobacterial strainsin order to validate the notion that the identical bifido- bacterial its-based otus that seem to be shared be- tween mother-newborn pairs are the result of vertical transmission we used 25 infant and mother stool sam- ples as well as milk samples to isolate bifidobacteria employing a selective cultivation medium table iso- lated colonies were identified by pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene followed by amplicon sequencing as previously described by turroni et al.

a corresponding mother and infant fecal samplesand associated milk sample we decided to utilize a pcr-based approach involving a pcr primer pair that was designed on unique sequences of a given phage additional file  table s5.

while the use of the primer pair p19-p20 results in the amplification of phage dna in infant and milk samples the second pri- mer pair p17-p18 unveiled the presence of a circular phage yet only in sample t3 of the child.

furthermore our analyses highlight how bifidobacteria being one of the dominant members of the infant gut microbiota are inherited from the mother through a vertical transmis- sion route and imply human milk as a potential vehicle to facilitate this acquisition.
