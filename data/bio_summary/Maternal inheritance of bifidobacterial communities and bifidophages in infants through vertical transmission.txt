.Genetic adaptation of early bifidobacterial colonizers to the infant gutTransmission of bifidobacteria from mother to her child may be possible through ingestion of mother's milk This human fluid represents a bacterial transmission medium that is ideal not only for micro- biota dispersal but also for the provision of nutrients to the initial colonizers of the infant gut Human milk is a very rich source of glycans including lactose and human milk oligosaccharides HMOs  which represent an important carbon and energy source for pioneering saccharolytic members of the infant gut microbiota in particular bifidobacteria -.

Bacteria may reach the mammary gland of the mother and may be transmitted directly to breastfed infants although inversely bifidobacteria may be intro- duced into human milk from the infant's oral cavity during suckling -.Notably several studies have highlighted the possibility of vertical transmission of components of the gut microbiota from mother to child  Further- more a recent pilot study involving four mother-child pairs revealed direct transmission of bifidobacterial strains from mothers to their newborns using a novel ITS-based approach Although intriguing the bio- logical relevance of such findings in this latter work is limited due to the small number of mother-infant pairs analysed Another important component of the gut microbiota is represented by virus-like particles in the GIT which together constitute the gut virome Currently very little is known about the infant virome -al- though the existence and impact of phages specific for bifidobacteria i.e.

The presence of putatively identi- fied bifidophages was screened in mother and infantfecal samples and milk samples by PCR based on unique genes of that particular bifidophage.Results and discussionEvaluation of the bifidobacterial composition of the gut microbiota of infantsTo characterize the bifidobacterial population in the in- fant gut we employed a recently developed pipeline based on sequencing of a hypervariable ITS region here referred to as ITS profiling We collected fecal samples of 25 infants at two different time points i.e.

This finding suggests the presence of the same bifidophage in both mother and infant microbiome expanding the previ- ous view of bifidobacterial phages multiplying in the infant gut thereby perhaps limiting overgrowth by their bifido- bacterial host .ConclusionsPassage through the birth canal during delivery and sub- sequent breastfeeding are considered important events that affect microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of the newborn In this study an NGS approach was employed to confirm the existence of a vertical transmission route of bifidobacterial com- munities in 25 mother and newborn pairs.

Notably these data are consistent with current knowledge on bifidobacterial HMOHMO-de- rived glycan utilization abilities -Interestingly the results of these fermentation profil- ing experiments correspond very well with those pre- dicted from the in silico analyses of the genomes decoded in this study.Genome reconstruction of shared bifidobacteria based on in silico analyses of microbiomesIn order to verify the occurrence of identical bifidobac- terial strains in the microbiota of an infant's fecal sample and in that of the corresponding milk andor fecal sam- ple of the mother a shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed of three infant samples TVPR-01 TVPR-02 and TVPR-03 for which we observed a high number of potentially vertically transmitted bifidobacterial strains.

Furthermore 10 ml of breast milk sample of each mother was collected in sterile tubes Table For the sample set TVPR03 we collected stool samples of in- fants and breast milk samples at 1 month followingbirth.

Bifidobacteria exhibit social behavior through carbohydrate resource sharing in the gut.

Very recently bifidophages have been discovered and their phage particles have been morphologically characterized However their inheritance in the infant gut from the gut virome of the respective mother was only hy- pothesized but never experimentally demonstrated.

Furthermore our analyses highlight how bifidobacteria being one of the dominant members of the infant gut microbiota are inherited from the mother through a vertical transmis- sion route and imply human milk as a potential vehicle to facilitate this acquisition.
