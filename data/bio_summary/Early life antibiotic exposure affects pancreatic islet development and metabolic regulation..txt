By adopting this well-controlled animal model that resembles traits of human infants we aimed to 1 investigate the effects of antibiotic exposure before weaning day 0 to 14 on metabolic outcomes later in life 2 examine the impact of antibiotic exposure on pancreatic development and 3 determine antibiotic-induced changes in microbial composition and metabolism in order to explore the possible mechanisms of early-life antibiotic exposure and metabolic outcomes later in life.ResultsEarly life antibiotic exposure alters glucose metabolism.

Willing1Childhood antibiotic exposure has been recently linked with increased risk of metabolic disease later in life.

Therefore we explored the underlying mechanisms using a swine model that better mimics human infants than rodents and demonstrated that early life antibiotic exposure affects glucose metabolism 5 weeks after antibiotic withdrawal which was associated withchanges in pancreatic development.

These findings suggest a programming effect of early life antibiotic exposure that merits further investigation.Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to infants and children to prevent bacterial infections resulting in high childhood antibiotic exposure rates worldwide.

Similar to previous studies antibiotic treatment did not cause significant global change in micro- biota however an increase in the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae was observed in ANTI pigs after 7-day antibiotic treatment.

Although still unclear it is plausible that reduced GPR41 expression could play a role in the observed antibiotic induced changes in response to glucose challenge.In summary by using a swine model for human infants we provide direct evidence that early life antibiotic exposure leads to impaired glucose metabolism later in life.

However antibiotic exposure of infants during the first 6 to 12 monthsof life has been associated with increased BMI body mass or risk of overweight up until 12 years of age.

Therefore it can be speculated that an altered gut microbiome during early life may result in changes in host development leading to metabolic disease later in life.It has been shown that sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment of C57BL6 J mice prenatally or at weaning resulted in a changed gut microbiome increased adiposity and subsequently altered hepatic metabolism of lipid and cholesterol which was worsened with a high fat diet.

Pulsed therapeutic-dose antibiotic treat- ment at days 10-15 28-31 and 37-40 of life affected microbiota composition accelerated total body mass and bone growth and changed hepatic gene expression.

Prolonged antibiotic treatment in the adult non-obese diabetic NOD mouse restructured gut microbiota com- position and resulted in reduced SCFA leading to accelerated T1D.
