The major aims were to 1 test the feasibility including participants' acceptance and satisfaction of collecting nasal and oropharyngeal swabs in this population-based setting 2 compare four swab types in the ability to detect microbial community structures at these two anatom- ical sites and 3 to test whether equivalent microbial communities could be detected by nasal swabs collected by the participants at home compared to nasal swabs collected by trained personnel in the study center.ResultsFigure shows the geographical locations of the six study centers and the type of swabbing conducted at each center.Preanalytical feasibility.Nasal swabbing at the study center.

The number of swabs analyzed were 54 swab 1 52 swab 2 and 44 swab 3 nasal swabs and 39 swab 1 34 swab 2 and 37 swab 3 oropharyngeal swabs.

In particular the data demonstrate the robustness of microbiome determinations from nasal swabs to differences in temperature after collection when RNAlater is used as a preservative whereas the staff-collected swabs were frozen shortly after collection the self-collected swabs were not frozen until receipt in the study center usually 1 or 2 days after collection.

Out of the 1807 swabs collected a subsample of 313 swabs 195 nasal and 118 oro- pharyngeal swabs originating from 258 participants was selected for microbiome analysis as this number was deemed large enough to achieve the major goals of the study Table  supplemental Table .

Compared to nasal swabs participants reported less com- fort when oropharyngeal swabs were collected Table .

To avoid any pos- sible bias introduced by incorporating multiple swabs from the same participant only 258 swabs 148 samples from the anterior nares and 110 oropharyngeal samples see Table and supplemental Table  were analyzed for comparing swab types or self-swabbing vs. swabbing by trained personal.

Pieper4  Frank Pessler123We examined acceptability preference and feasibility of collecting nasal and oropharyngeal swabs followed by microbiome analysis in a population-based study with 524 participants.

They also showed higher species diversity using both Shannon and Simpson Diversity Indices H'  3.86 - 0.33 for oropharyngeal vs. 2.17 - 0.60 for nasal communities and 1-D  0.96 - 0.02 for oropharyngeal vs. 0.76 - 0.14 for nasal communities but higher species evenness J'  0.73 - 0.04 for oropharyngeal vs. 0.49 - 0.11 for nasal communities.Comparison of swab types 1 2 and 3.

The communities of 54 nasal swabs self-collected by the participants at home were compared to 54 age and sex matched staff-collected swabs taken at the study centers.
