On the one hand gut microbiota prevents excessive immune response to protect itself by conditioning intestinal dendritic cells to be tolerogenic phenotype that is inducing differentiation of resident T cells into T helper 2 and regulatory T Treg subsets30 and inhibiting the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kB activiation.31 On the other hand gut microbiota can stimulate the production of immunoglobulin A IgA the major intestinal mucosal antibody isotype by activating resident dendritic cells allowing the inhibition of overgrowth of the bacterial population.32 The commensal bacteria addition- ally contribute to intestinal homeostasis against invading pathogens by competitive exclusion and induction of antimicrobial substances.33 Besides gut microbiota is capable of facilitating GIT structural maturation by promoting angiogenesis34 gut barrier maintenance35 and mu- cosal glycosylation.36 4 Affecting brain function and behavior Gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system CNS through the brain-gut axis a process involving neural endocrine and immune pathways and thereby affects brain function and host behavior.37 Gut microbiota has a crucial role in the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axisMedicinal Research Reviews DOI 10.1002medevidenced by exaggerated release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone in germ- free mice compared with normal and specific pathogen-free mice38 the effects of gut microbiota on brain function have been shown to rely on vagal activation39 the immune system is also a target for transducing the effects of bacteria on brain as it directly contacts both gut micro- biota and CNS.40 Apart from these gut microbiota can impact brain function and behavior by regulating tryptophan metabolism41 producing neuroactive metabolites SCFAs42 and neu- rometabolites neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.43 These important contributions of gut microbiota to host physiological and psychological functions can rationalize its significant and complicated involvement in host pathogenesis.

This interplay includes such activities as gut microbiota biotransforming HM chemicals into metabolites that harbor different bioavailability and bioactivitytoxicity from their precursors HM chemicals improving the composition of gut microbiota consequently ameliorating its dysfunction as well as associated pathological conditions and gut microbiota mediating the interactions synergistic and antagonistic between the multiple chemicals in HMs.

The association between the substantial involvement of gut microbiota in disease development and the plasticity of gut microbiota composition in the presence of HMs suggests that modulation of gut microbiota is one mechanism by which HMs taken orally treat disease in addition to their direct effects on targeted tissues andor organs after gastrointestinal absorption.

For instance oral administration affords the opportunity for the encounter and then the interactions between HM chemicals and gut microbiota gut microbiota mediated multicomponent synergistic actions substantiate the multiple components against multiple targets principle in the application of HM extracts and formulas.Medicinal Research Reviews DOI 10.1002medUnderstanding the interplay between gut microbiota and HMs would also revolutionize HM-based drug discovery.

Up to now however single compound research has prevailed in HM research involving gut microbiota that is researchers examine how an individual HM compound is metabolized by gut microbiota and conversely the effect of an individual HM compound on gut microbiota.

More advanced experimental designs are recommended for future study such as overall chemical characterization of gut microbiota-metabolized HMs direct microbial analysis of HM-targeted gut microbiota and precise gut microbiota research model development.

A large number of studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota is implicated in mammalian host health and disease.17 Substantial interactions between gut microbiota and the chemical components of HMs are also being intensively examined.18 19 To be specific gut mi- crobiota can metabolize HM chemicals and the generated metabolites possess different more or less bioavailability bioactivity and toxicity from their precursors.

Many dietary and host-derived sub- strates such as polysaccharides bile acids and choline are either independently metabolized by gut microbiota or co-metabolized with the aid of the mammalian host.24 The gut microbiota produced metabolites are essential beneficial or sometimes deleterious both systemically and locally as listed in the review by Nicholson et al.25 via various signaling pathways.

This has been directly verified by multifaceted immunological defects observed in germ-free models as well as the pathological improvements following gut microbiota colonization.26 Further studies have revealed some mechanisms by which gut microbiota contributes to host systemic immunity involving cellular immunity and lymphoid organogenesis.

A variety of compositional abnormalities dysbiosis of gut microbiota have been shown to be strongly associated with certain diseases typically metabolic disorders that is obesity44 diabetes45 46 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD47 as well as cancer48 inflammatory bowel disease IBD49 and irritable bowel syn- drome IBS.50 Intriguingly these illnesses can be mitigated or even reversed by favorable alterations of the intestinal microflora toward homeostasis.17 22 51 Although these associations have been clearly demonstrated we still do not understand the exact mechanisms by which the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and pathological conditions are related.52-57 Nevertheless even without thorough understanding of the how and why such implications suggest novel clinical bacteriotherapy strategies namely xenobiotic intervention using specific prebiotics probiotics synbiotics and fecal transplantation to restore the balance of gut microbial community and consequently to prevent and treat related diseases.52 53HMs AND GUT MICROBIOTAHM Metabolism Involves Gut Microbiota1 Noncarbohydrate Small MoleculesIn clinical practice HMs are most often extracted by water or ethanol to generate decoc- tion infusion or tincture for oral administration.
