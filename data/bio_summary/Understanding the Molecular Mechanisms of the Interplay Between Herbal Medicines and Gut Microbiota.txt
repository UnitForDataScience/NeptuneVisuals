On the one hand gut microbiota prevents excessive immune response to protect itself by conditioning intestinal dendritic cells to be tolerogenic phenotype that is inducing differentiation of resident T cells into T helper 2 and regulatory T Treg subsets30 and inhibiting the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kB activiation.31 On the other hand gut microbiota can stimulate the production of immunoglobulin A IgA the major intestinal mucosal antibody isotype by activating resident dendritic cells allowing the inhibition of overgrowth of the bacterial population.32 The commensal bacteria addition- ally contribute to intestinal homeostasis against invading pathogens by competitive exclusion and induction of antimicrobial substances.33 Besides gut microbiota is capable of facilitating GIT structural maturation by promoting angiogenesis34 gut barrier maintenance35 and mu- cosal glycosylation.36 4 Affecting brain function and behavior Gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system CNS through the brain-gut axis a process involving neural endocrine and immune pathways and thereby affects brain function and host behavior.37 Gut microbiota has a crucial role in the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axisMedicinal Research Reviews DOI 10.1002medevidenced by exaggerated release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone in germ- free mice compared with normal and specific pathogen-free mice38 the effects of gut microbiota on brain function have been shown to rely on vagal activation39 the immune system is also a target for transducing the effects of bacteria on brain as it directly contacts both gut micro- biota and CNS.40 Apart from these gut microbiota can impact brain function and behavior by regulating tryptophan metabolism41 producing neuroactive metabolites SCFAs42 and neu- rometabolites neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.43 These important contributions of gut microbiota to host physiological and psychological functions can rationalize its significant and complicated involvement in host pathogenesis.

This interplay includes such activities as gut microbiota biotransforming HM chemicals into metabolites that harbor different bioavailability and bioactivitytoxicity from their precursors HM chemicals improving the composition of gut microbiota consequently ameliorating its dysfunction as well as associated pathological conditions and gut microbiota mediating the interactions synergistic and antagonistic between the multiple chemicals in HMs.

The association between the substantial involvement of gut microbiota in disease development and the plasticity of gut microbiota composition in the presence of HMs suggests that modulation of gut microbiota is one mechanism by which HMs taken orally treat disease in addition to their direct effects on targeted tissues andor organs after gastrointestinal absorption.

For instance oral administration affords the opportunity for the encounter and then the interactions between HM chemicals and gut microbiota gut microbiota mediated multicomponent synergistic actions substantiate the multiple components against multiple targets principle in the application of HM extracts and formulas.Medicinal Research Reviews DOI 10.1002medUnderstanding the interplay between gut microbiota and HMs would also revolutionize HM-based drug discovery.
