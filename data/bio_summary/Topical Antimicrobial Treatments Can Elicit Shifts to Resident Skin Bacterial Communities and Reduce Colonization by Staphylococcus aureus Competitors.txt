We show that treatment can promote exogenous association with S. aureus and that the same Staphylococcus residents disrupted by treatment are also capable of S. aureus competition decreasingS.

Indeed most mice exhibited greater than 10-fold reductions in S. aureus and many including those precolonized with S. epidermidis were capable of decreasing S. aureus by levels greater than 100-fold.

As hypothesized we observed a slight but significant increase in S. aureus levels in treated mice compared with that in untreated controls indicating a reduction in colonization resistance in response to treatment .Because this effect could also be the result of additional factors including previously unidentified microbial inhabitants we next profiled individual Staphylococcus isolatesa 86Change Frequency4Group 1Group 220d0d7d14d21d28d35d42d49Time Pointd56b 8642c 8Treatment6No Treat PEGMupirocin4Petrolatum TAO2Treatment No Treat PEGMupirocin Petrolatum TAO001234567DayBaselinePost-TRX 8n.s.n.s.n.s.n.s.6001234567DayBaselinePost-TRX 8644220UWAP-ITreatment0UWAP-ITreatmentFIG 4 Antimicrobial treatment alters resident Staphylococcus colonization in a baseline-dependent manner.

In all our results demonstrate that antimicrobial drugs can elicit long-term shifts in skin bacterial com- munities and that treatment with these agents has key implications for host suscepti- bility to pathogens such as S. aureus.RESULTSTopical antibiotic treatment alters skin bacterial residents.

We found that treated mice were more susceptible to exogenous association with S. aureus and that precoloniza- tion with the same Staphylococcus residents that were previously disrupted by treat- ment reduced S. aureus levels by over 100-fold.

To evaluate the ability of each isolate to restrict S. aureus coloni- zation we precolonized mice with each Staphylococcus resident similar to the method described above and then challenged them with S. aureus 1 day later.

Importantly we found that all isolates were capable of protecting against S. aureus association with a number of mice exhibiting reductions in S. aureus levels by over 100-fold.

In all this shows that skin bacterial residents can compete with S. aureus at the skin surface and that their removal can impact S. aureus colonization potential.DISCUSSIONGiven the expansive use of topical antibiotics and antiseptics it is somewhat surprising that longitudinal studies to evaluate their effects on a community-wide scale are not more common.

Moreover while Staphylococcus colonization in HS mice was significantly decreased following treatment untreated mice with a single cage change exhibited an almost identical reduction in colonization confirming that a change in environment can also have significant impacts on bacterial communities .

These particular changes also displayed similar kinetics to those of bacterial taxa in TAO-treated mice including immediate increases in rarified abundance and sustained posttreatment effects under- scoring the difficulties faced by skin communities when attempting to reacclimate upon treatment cessation.An analysis of bacterial burden revealed a contrasting effect of antibiotics on absolute abundance as well.
