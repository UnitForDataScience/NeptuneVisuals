Intestinal dysbiosis is also linked to behavioral impairment  stimulating extensive research into the role of gut microbiota in mental and neurological health.A pivotal early study on gut microbiota and neurobehavioral function revealed that germ-free mice lacking intestinal and other microbiota display maladaptive and exaggerated responses to stress that can be normalized by probiotic- induced intestinal recolonization .

With regard todiet-induced intestinal inflammation dietary fats particularly trans and saturated fats have been shown to transiently in- crease intestinal inflammation even in healthy subjects  which in turn alters gut microbial populations by decreasing commensal i.e.

Indeed increases in intestinal Pro- teobacteria are associated with intestinal permeability and circulating endotoxin  which are in turn linked to brain inflammation and neurobehavioral dysfunction .

Collectively these data indicate that intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal inflammation can synergis- tically drive a cascade of local-to-systemic inflammation.THERAPEUTIC MANIPULATION OF GUT MICROBIOTADiet QualityStudies show that the effects of diet on the human gut microbiome are rapid and driven by quality and quantity of dietary fat and carbohydrates .

Experimental and clinical data regarding means of therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota as a novel treatment option for mental health are described and important knowledge gaps are identified and discussed.Keywords Depression Gut dysbiosis Gut-brain axis Mental health Microbiota transplant Probiotics INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL CONTEXTGut microbiota comprise all microorganisms inhabiting the intestinal tract and their respective genomes.

Experimental and clinical studies suggest that disruption to gut microbiota can impair physical and mental health  suggesting that intestinal microbiota could underlie host susceptibility to illness .

Links between microbiota and pathophysiology have triggered an explosion of interest in this field with 85 of the more than 10000 PubMed publications on intestinal microbiota arising in the last 5 years currently averaging about five new publications per day.

In the less distant past Elie Metchnikoff theorized that health could be enhanced and senility delayed by manipu- lating the intestinal microbiome with host-friendly bacteria .

In this nonsystem- atic narrative review we summarize current understanding of intestinal microbial influences on physiological function with an emphasis on behavioral and neurological impairment.

The role of gut microbiota in this system is highlighted by the well- established relationship between overnutrition and reduced intestinal microbial diversity and disrupted pathogen commensal balance dysbiosis .
