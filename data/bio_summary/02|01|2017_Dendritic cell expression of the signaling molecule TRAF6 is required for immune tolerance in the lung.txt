This work provides both a novel tool for studying immune tolerance in the lung and an advance in our conceptual understanding of potentially common molecular mechanisms of immune tolerance in both the intestine and the lung.Keywords antibiotics asthma dendritic cell germ-free Th2 immunityIntroductionMucosal immune tolerance mechanisms are most prominently studied between the immune cells of the intestinal lining and commensal microbiota  .

Such accumulation of proliferative Tregs may contribute to establish immune tolerance in the lung.Overall we have presented data here using TRAF6DDC mice that bolsters the notion that immune tolerance in mucosal tissues is regulated across anatomically distant locations like the gut and lung by a form of regulatory cross-talk and fur- ther that TRAF6DDC mice may be employed as a useful tool for better characterizing the mechanisms controlling immune tolerance in the lung.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at International ImmunologyOnline.FundingThis work was supported by the Institute for Basic Science IBS-R005-D1 to D.H. K.S.K.

These data show that antibiotics treatment ame- liorates spontaneous Th2 responses in the TRAF6DDC lung and suggest that they may act in a manner similar to that observed in the small intestine of the same mice.GF conditions do not restore immune tolerance in the TRAF6DDC lungThe effects of antibiotics on the TRAF6DDC lung pheno- type may imply a crucial role for microbiota in driving loss of immune tolerance in the lung.

It is also possible that stimuli encountered in one mucosal location have effects on the maintenance of immune tolerance at another mucosal site because of trafficking of immune cells soluble factors or even the stimuli themselves .

It will be important for instance to investigate the role of oral antigens in regulating immune tolerance of the small intestine of TRAF6DDC mice and further whether the anti- gen experienced through this route contributes to immune responses in the lung.

Similarly it will be interesting to deter- mine whether inhaled antigens impact gut immune tolerance in the absence of DC-expressed TRAF6.As we have speculated previously with respect to anti- biotic treatment of TRAF6DDC mice  it may be that increased Treg frequency observed in the small intestine is due indirectly to reduction of effector T cells by antibiotic treatment since metronidazole and vancomycin have previ- ously been reported to directly inhibit proliferation of immune cells  .

Therefore antibiotics may act directly on immune cells in the TRAF6DDC lung in a pro-tolerogenic manner that is either independent of Tregs or possibly may act more efficiently on non-Tregs than on Tregs.DiscussionWe have presented findings here that DC-expressed TRAF6 is important for immune tolerance in the lung which givenFig.

Additional work will need to be performed to determine both the receptors or receptor families involved in this type of immune regulation and on which DC subsets their expression is required.Evidence exists that microbiota-derived stimuli are critical mediators of immune tolerance in the lung and that these stim- uli participate in gut-lung signaling cross-talk .

TGFbR andor TNFR super- families that also employ TRAF6 for signal transduction and are involved in immune tolerance-related functions .It is also important to determine the source of antigen relevant to TRAF6-dependent immune tolerance in the lung as well as in the small intestine.
