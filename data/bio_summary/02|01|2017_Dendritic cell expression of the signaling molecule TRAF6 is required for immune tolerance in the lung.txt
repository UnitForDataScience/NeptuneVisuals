such accumulation of proliferative tregs may contribute to establish immune tolerance in the lung.overall we have presented data here using traf6ddc mice that bolsters the notion that immune tolerance in mucosal tissues is regulated across anatomically distant locations like the gut and lung by a form of regulatory cross-talk and fur- ther that traf6ddc mice may be employed as a useful tool for better characterizing the mechanisms controlling immune tolerance in the lung.supplementary datasupplementary data are available at international immunologyonline.fundingthis work was supported by the institute for basic science ibs-r005-d1 to d.h. k.s.k.

these data show that antibiotics treatment ame- liorates spontaneous th2 responses in the traf6ddc lung and suggest that they may act in a manner similar to that observed in the small intestine of the same mice.gf conditions do not restore immune tolerance in the traf6ddc lungthe effects of antibiotics on the traf6ddc lung pheno- type may imply a crucial role for microbiota in driving loss of immune tolerance in the lung.

this work provides both a novel tool for studying immune tolerance in the lung and an advance in our conceptual understanding of potentially common molecular mechanisms of immune tolerance in both the intestine and the lung.keywords antibiotics asthma dendritic cell germ-free th2 immunityintroductionmucosal immune tolerance mechanisms are most prominently studied between the immune cells of the intestinal lining and commensal microbiota  .

these data further suggest that traf6ddc mice may be a suitable model for studying mechanisms of respira- tory hypersensitivity driven by inhaled antigens.effect of antibiotics on th2 immunity in the traf6ddc lungcommensal microbiota found primarily in the gut but also at lower numbers in the lung is considered to have a sig- nificant role in influencing immune tolerance regulated via gut-lung cross-talk .

it will be important for instance to investigate the role of oral antigens in regulating immune tolerance of the small intestine of traf6ddc mice and further whether the anti- gen experienced through this route contributes to immune responses in the lung.

similarly it will be interesting to deter- mine whether inhaled antigens impact gut immune tolerance in the absence of dc-expressed traf6.as we have speculated previously with respect to anti- biotic treatment of traf6ddc mice  it may be that increased treg frequency observed in the small intestine is due indirectly to reduction of effector t cells by antibiotic treatment since metronidazole and vancomycin have previ- ously been reported to directly inhibit proliferation of immune cells  .

therefore antibiotics may act directly on immune cells in the traf6ddc lung in a pro-tolerogenic manner that is either independent of tregs or possibly may act more efficiently on non-tregs than on tregs.discussionwe have presented findings here that dc-expressed traf6 is important for immune tolerance in the lung which givenfig.

analysis of the lungs of control and traf6ddc mice revealed that while eosinophil infiltration was higher in traf6ddc mice than in control mice given only pbs eosinophil frequencies in the lungs of traf6ddc mice exposed to ova were more dra- matically increased compared to similarly treated control mice and .

because th2-linked hypersensitivity is of particular clinical importance to the lung where dysregula- tion can result in the development and persistence of asthma   we reasoned that traf6ddc mice could be a usefulmodel to examine potential mechanistic links between gut and lung cross-talk with respect to immune tolerance.

therefore it is likely that the stimuli driving loss of immune tolerance in the traf6ddc lung is not derived from a microbial source.fig.

therefore these data suggest that the observed effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics treatment on the lung resulted not from removal of commensal microbiota but rather from side effects of the antibiotics.antibiotics reduce traf6ddc lung t-cell proliferationour previous work suggests that antibiotics treatment may exert direct effects on the treg population in the small intestine andthat this enhanced treg activity may be sufficient to overcome any loss of immune tolerance cause by lack of dc-expressed traf6 .

however we have observed here that traf6ddc mice exhibit loss of immune tolerance in the lung regardless of the presence of commensal microbiota.

it is also possible that stimuli encountered in one mucosal location have effects on the maintenance of immune tolerance at another mucosal site because of trafficking of immune cells soluble factors or even the stimuli themselves .
