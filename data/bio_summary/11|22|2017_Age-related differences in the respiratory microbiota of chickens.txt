members of the respiratory microbiota also contribute to the maintenance of the mucosal immune system  and alter- ations in the local immune environment such as increased inflammation due to acute lung injury can also lead to changes in the bacterial communities present and the outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens .investment into understanding the composition of bacterial communities their effect on the immune status of the respiratory tract and the interaction with pathogens in chickens would likely have a positive impact on poultry health given the fact that most viruses in chicken enter through the respiratory tract and the live attenuated vaccines to prevent them are given by spray or oculonasal route.using culture based methods a wide variety of bacteria and fungi have been isolated from the respiratory tracts of healthy chickens -.

changes in the composition of the respiratory microbiota in mammals have been shown to be correlated with various respiratory diseases and to vaccination against spe- cific respiratory pathogens .this study shows that using 16s rrna gene analysis to study the chicken respiratory micro- biota can allow us to detect the presence of bacteria which may be missed in culture based studies.

no otus were found to be significantly indicative of samples from the 2 day or 3 week age groups.discussionthis is the first published study to compare the microbiota at multiple respiratory sites of chickens from different age groups using 16s rrna gene analysis.

the richness of these bacterial communities was also significantly different between age groups kruskal-wallis test p  0.02 with richness rising with age but age groups did not differ sig- nificantly in diversity.

the richness of these bacterial communities was also significantly different between age groups kruskal-wallis test p  0.01 with richness rising with age but age groups did not differ sig- nificantly in diversity.

the 30 month age group clustered sig- nificantly separately from both the 2 day age group amova p  0.045 and the 3 week age group amova p  0.031 however the 2 day and 3 week samples did not cluster signifi- cantly separately from one another.after pseudomonas removal the most common bacterial otus found on average in bal fluid samples were lactobacillus 7.4 turicibacter 6.6 achromobacter 5.2 methylo- bacterium 4.8 smb53 4.7 and lactobacillus 4.3 .

this study was further funded by the biotechnology and biological sciences research council  institute strategic program grant bbp0137591 to the roslin institute and the animal health andintroductionmany studies have been performed which have used 16s rrna gene analysis to study the human respiratory microbiota and it has been recognised that these communities of bacteria are highly important in the maintenance of respiratory health .however to our knowledge only one study has been published which has studied the respi- ratory microbiota of the healthy chicken using 16s rrna gene analysis .

in mammals the composition of the respiratory microbiota is associ- ated with disease severity  and future risk of developing respiratory disease .

the funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist.against respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumonia has also been linked to changes in the respiratory bacterial flora as the suppression of vaccine targets within these communities can lead to the proliferation of other bacterial species .

this may be due to differences between the human and avian respiratory systems or due to the different environmental conditions to which these species are exposed.while the presence of staphylococci lactobacilli and members of the enterobacteriaceae corresponds with previous findings from culture based studies we identified several bacteria which were in 25 abundance in at least one of our respiratory samples which had previously not been identified in high abundance in culture based studies.
