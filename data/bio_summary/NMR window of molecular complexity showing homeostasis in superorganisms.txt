chemical shift versus intensity with high reproducibility and inter-institution convertibility advanced data science approaches such as multivariate analysis and machine learning are desirable therefore we also introduce informatics techniques derived from hetero- geneously measured data such as environmental microbiota for the extraction of submerged information using data science approaches.

In addition to spectral processing functions powerful features for data organization data pre-processing and data analysis have been implemented.

This software can analyse NMR data using multivariate analysis methods automatically and calculate statistical results.AMIX1 3 5AMIX provides PCA SIMCA PLS PLS-DA and covariance analysis and is effective in interpretingApplication----metabolomics results.Automics1021 3The first open source software tool with highly integrated modules specifically designed for NMR-Application2009--based metabolomics applications.

1.2.1 NMR analysis of molecular complexityRecently solution NMR has been used for metabolic profiling whereby NMR spectra of mixtures of small biological mole- cules are subjected to further multivariate analyses to identify metabolite biomarkers42-46 and to evaluate nutrients in foods.47-50 Innovations in nontargeted approaches for studying biological systems are important for improving biomass production and for better sustainability of such systems.One-dimensional 1D solution NMR is often used for meta- bolic analysis.

For example chemometric analysis PCA and PLS discri- minant analysis PLS-DA are available and machine learning approaches support hierarchical clustering with heat mapsself-organizing maps and k-means clustering.
