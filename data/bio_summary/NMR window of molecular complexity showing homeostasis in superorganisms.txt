chemical shift versus intensity with high reproducibility and inter-institution convertibility advanced data science approaches such as multivariate analysis and machine learning are desirable therefore we also introduce informatics techniques derived from hetero- geneously measured data such as environmental microbiota for the extraction of submerged information using data science approaches.

in addition to spectral processing functions powerful features for data organization data pre-processing and data analysis have been implemented.

1.2.1 nmr analysis of molecular complexityrecently solution nmr has been used for metabolic profiling whereby nmr spectra of mixtures of small biological mole- cules are subjected to further multivariate analyses to identify metabolite biomarkers42-46 and to evaluate nutrients in foods.47-50 innovations in nontargeted approaches for studying biological systems are important for improving biomass production and for better sustainability of such systems.one-dimensional 1d solution nmr is often used for meta- bolic analysis.

this type of analysis also called target analysis usually requires specific extraction methods and sample pretreatment.

we introduce useful databases and web tools to characterize metabolites from complex nmr spectra as well as informatics techniques such as multivariate analysis for the extraction of information submerged in the nmr matrix data.

the drawback of binning is that there is a considerable reduction in spectral resolution.56scaling and normalization are also important in data pre- treatment and preprocessing.57 extreme differences in scalesjun kikuchijun kikuchi is a team leader of the environmental metabolic analysis research team of the riken center for sustainable resource science as well as a visiting professor of nagoya university and yokohama city university.
