Further infection models are required to elucidate the contribution of viral glycosylation to infection dynamics.Using Glycosyltransferase Characteristics to Inform Policy and PracticeThe majority of studies discussed have been observational with stratification by glycosylation status revealing differences in infection or disease susceptibility.

As these examples demon- strate the dynamics of how glycan-mediated adherence either membrane-bound or luminal ultimately confers susceptibility or resistance to infection is complex.Commensal Influence FUT2 and the MicrobiotaIn addition to influencing pathogen adherence FUT2 has been shown to also affect infection susceptibility indirectly.

These growing data repositories provide an opportunity to explore effects of glycosylation variability on risks of infection and disease susceptibility at a population-level as well as at an individual level.Glycosylation status might for example be informative at a population level during infection outbreaks where identifying at-risk individuals is vital for effective control management and global security.

Infection and pathogenesis are complex processes with mucosal glycans likely influencing susceptibility through both direct and indirect mechanisms.Sticking Around FUT2 and Pathogen Adherencea12-fucosylated glycans influence infection susceptibility directly through facilitating patho- gen adherence.

BabA has a specificity for the 'Lewis b' a12-fucosylated mucosal glycan therefore BabA-expressing H. pylori is more readily able to adhere to the gastric mucosa and colonize the stomachs of secretor individuals A. BabA-encoding H. pylori and subsequent infection susceptibility is something of an exception as this is the only bacterial species listed in where susceptibility is increased in secretors due to the specificity of BabA towards a12- fucosylated glycans.

At an individual level identifica- tion of common genetic infection and disease risk factors such as FUT2 SNPs could inform and direct an individual's behaviour to minimise infection and disease risk particularly when linked to other risk factors.

OpinionInfection's Sweet Tooth How Glycans Mediate Infection and Disease SusceptibilitySteven L. Taylor Steve WesselinghGlycans form a highly variable constituent of our mucosal surfaces and pro- foundly affect our susceptibility to infection and disease.

Indeed the contribution of mucosal glycans to infection susceptibility has gained much recent interest owing to studies that have provided mechanistic insight into their function .Mucosal constituents that are decorated with glycans are formed through a process mediated by a diverse family of glycosyltransferase enzymes mostly acting in a template-independent manner .

In addition to an absence of a12-fucosylated glycans in mucosal secretions including the absence of histo-blood group antigens nonsecretors also display increased levels of sialylated glycans in mucosal secretions  presumably as a result of reduced glycosyltransferase competition.A clue as to why these loss-of-function mutations are carried at such a high frequency and an illustration more generally of the importance of surface glycans to infection susceptibility is the major differences in rates of bacterial- and viral-mediated diseases between secretors and nonsecretors  Key Table.

Therefore infection susceptibility where pathogens adhere to glycans depends on the location and anchoring of the glycan.
