openreceived 1 november 2017accepted 30 november 2017 published xx xx xxxxaltered gut microbiota profiles in sows and neonatal pigletsassociated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infectiondeping song12 qi peng12yanjun chen12 xinrong zhou12 fanfan zhang12 anqi li12 dongyan huang12 qiong wu12yuye12 houjun he12 leyi wang3 yuxin tang12porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a devastating cause of diarrhea in pigs worldwide.

therefore further investigations on gm perturbations in pedv-infected sows and newborn piglets are indeed needed.in the present study we attempted to elucidate the gm profiles in naturally pedv infected sows and healthy sows and the offspring delivered by these sows.

interestingly a butyrate-producing bacteria clostridium butyricum was significantly higher in abundance in hs samples than that in as and ds samples p  0.028. the family desulfovibrionaceae and genus desulfovibrio which is positively associated with inflammation were observed in higher percentage in as than that in hs and ds groups.the diarrheal sows had a significantly different gm structure compared to that in the healthy sows fig.

for sows a significant decrease of observed species was found in diarrheal sows than that in healthy sows p 0.05. the unweighted and weighted unifrac distances also revealed considerable segregations of gm structure among healthy asymptomatic and diarrheal sows.

our findings from this study demonstrated that the gut microbiota were altered due to pedv infection which caused the severe perturbations of gm in both sows and piglets through diminishing probiotic bacteria and enriching pathogenic bacteria.materials and methodssamples.

the variant pedv caused severe diarrhea vomiting dehydration and high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets as well as sporadic diarrhea in sows and finishing pigs in china in 2010. afterwards the outbreaks have been reported in europe america and other asian countries.

.at the phylum level the percentiles of dominant phyla of gut microbes in hs were 47.39 for bacteroidetes 34.57 for firmicutes 5.74 for proteobacteria 4.64 for spirochaetes 4.05 for tenericutes and 1.36 for verrucomicrobia respectively while in hp the abundances of these bacteria were 76.29 21.18 2.12 0.02 0.03 and 0 respectively table s4a.

in contrast unclassified otu in the hs was as high as 60.11. bacteroides the most abun- dant genus in hp accounted for about half of the abundance on genus level in hp while there was only 1.39 in hs table s4b.

the gm structure of hs showed different alpha indices from that of hp the hs gm have significant higher shannon index 7.24 - 0.50 s. d. observed species 1328 - 315 s. d. and good's coverage 0.96 - 0.001 s. d. than those of hp 4.65 - 1.21 s. d. p  0.019 482 - 235 s. d. p  0.009 0.98 - 0.007 s. d. p  0.002 while no marked differ- ence was observed in chao1 fig.

our findings demonstrated that pedv infection caused severe perturbations of gm reduced probiotic bacteria and enriched pathogenic bacteria.since 2010 the global swine industry has experienced outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv-.

in particular the gm in hp samples were largely dominated by bacteroidetes 78.80 - 16.38 s. d. significantly higher than those in ap and dp samples p  0.000 while the ap and dp samples contained a large number of taxa belonging to phylum fusobacteria ap 15.36 - 25.59 s. d. dp 14.23 - 24.65 s. d.. additionally the ap and dp samples were remarkably different from hs with respect to high abundances of phylum proteobacteria ap 16.43 - 27.34 s. d. and dp 12.74 - 15.87 s. d.. at the genus level about half of the reads from hp samples were assigned to bacteroides 49.35 followed by prevotella 12.28 lactobacillus 8.21 and oscillospira 1.29. the ap and dp samples showed remarkable differences in micro- biota diversity and relative abundance and the highest abundance of bacteria in both ap and dp samples was fusobacterium ap 18.08 dp 15.28 followed by lactobacillus bacteroides prevotella sutterella veillonella parabacteroides oscillospira and clostridium in ap samples and lactobacillus bacteroides clostridium prevotella veillonella ruminococcus campylobacter streptococcus collinsella oscillospira treponema escherichia peptostreptococcus and enterococcus in dp samples.lefse algorithm on microbial abundances of gm in piglets showed significant differences between the normal asymptomatic and diarrheal piglets.

it has been reported that there is an association of enterococci to neonatal porcine diarrhea and also association with resistance to several antibiotics which could explain why the inefficiency of antibi- otic treatment of these diarrheal piglets.conclusionin conclusion our study demonstrates that dysbiosis in gut microbiota occurs in asymptomatic and diarrheal sows and their piglets.

to our knowledge this is the first report of using next-generation sequencing technology to compare the gut microbiota in asymptomatic and diarrheal sows nat- urally infected with pedv and their newborn piglets as well.

most of studies have focused on molecular and pathogenic characterization of pedv whereas there were limited studies in understanding the role of gut microbiota gm in viral-associated diarrhea.
