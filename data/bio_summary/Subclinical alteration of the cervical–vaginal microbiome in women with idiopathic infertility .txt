The couples that do not benefit from infertility treatment after the assessment of tubal patency normal ovulatory and sperm parameters have a diagnosis of idiopathic or unexplained infertility Ray Shah Gudi  Homburg An efficient treatment for infertility depends on the identifica- tion of a vast range of biomarkers in order to select the best existing therapy among the many possible options thus a correct identifica- tion of the ongoing alterations is fundamental for selecting a suitable therapy.Recent studies associate opportunistic pathogens in the lower female reproductive tract with adverse pregnancy outcomes after both natural and in vitro fertilization IVF conceptions Fox and Eichelberger Franasiak et al.

The study design identified four groups including women with idiopathic infertility Idiopathic n 14 women with a diagnosed infertility Infertile n 13 fertile women with BV Vaginosis n 39 and fertile healthy women Control n 30.TABLE 1 Demographics of groupsInfertility factorsPregnancy outcomeOut of 27 infertile women 14 were diagnosed with idiopathic infertility.

Malik Jain Hakim Shukla  Rizvi Recent findings investigated the role of Bacterial Vaginosis BV causing species in the subclinical alteration of the vaginal micro- biome and their relationship with women's infertility van Oostrum et al.

The alteration of vaginal environment may facilitate the ascending dissemination of the infecting species that could finally lead to tubal factor infertility Mastromarino et al.

vaginalis normally expected in Vaginosis is absent only in Control 0.3 and common to both Idiopathic and Infertile.Despite the low abundance we suggest a role for A. vaginae P. bivia V. montpellierensis E. fergusonii and U. parvum as secondary players in Idiopathic infertility where they could strengthen a previous imbalance in the healthy vaginal microbiome.

We compared the vaginal microbiome of infertile women affected by different clinicalphysiological conditions with that of healthy and bacterial vaginosis affected women.Data from the present study are consistent with recent reports which documented that infertility condition is accompanied by acompositional change in the vaginal microbiota.
