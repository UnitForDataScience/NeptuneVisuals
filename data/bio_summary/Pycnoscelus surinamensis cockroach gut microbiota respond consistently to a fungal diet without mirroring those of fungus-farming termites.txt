further experimentation using longer feeding periods and providing cockroaches with fungus-grow- ing termite bacterial inocula could help establish the longer-term implications of exposing cockroaches to a fungal based diet and the extents to which diet can shape the gut microbiota.conclusionsour findings demonstrate in a remarkably consistent step-wise manner how a fungal diet can play a role in structuring gut community compositions in cockroaches while exemplifying how original community compositions and likely the inherent gut microenvironment con- strain the extent and magnitude of such change.

a shift to a proteinaceous diet as cockroaches are fed on increasing proportions of fungal material may cause such bacteria to become functionally redundant and decline in abundance as alternative lineages able to utilize fungal biomass are promoted.a fungal diet alone does not make guts converge upon those of fungus- farming termitesthe pcoa analysis comparing the two extremes 0 and 100 fungal diet with community similarities to odontotermes sp.

these bacteria are also found in lower abundances within the fungus-growing termite core  suggesting that these rare line- ages found within p. surinamensis are promoted by a fungal diet and contribute to the overall patterns of community similarity.taxa selected for or against in fungal-fed cockroachesin addition to the otus that contribute the most to the shifts associated with a fungal diet we identified forty-two bacteria that were absent in leaf-litter feeding cockroaches but present in 100 fungus-feeding cockroaches and odontotermes sp.

eighteen of these otus were also recovered in a similar analysis on which bacteria contribute to the separation of gut communities in cockroaches on 0 or 100 fungal diet  and tables and these otus are given in .five of the bacteria that contribute the most to this shift were reduced in average relative abundance in the 100 fungus diet with the termite cockroach cluster 1 planctomycetes otu exhibiting the most marked change from an average of 7.0 relative abundance in cock- roaches on leaf litter to only 0.2 in the 100 fungal diet .

across the diet regimes the 20 most abundant bacteria accounted for 35.2 of the total community abundance and tables and these were five genus-level firmicutes otus 12.1 six genus-level bacteriodetes otus 5.6 five genus-level proteobacteria otus 7.2 two genus-level actinobacteria otus 2.2 and one otu from each of the phyla synergistetes candidatus tammella 3.6 and planctomy- cetes termite cockroach cluster 1 3.3 and tables.gut community composition changes associated with a shift to a fungal dietour comparison of bacterial community diversity in the guts of p. surinamensis cockroaches fed on increasing dietary proportions of fungal material demonstrated the influence diet can have as a structuring force of communities.

but not in cockroaches fed on a 0 fungal diet.fungal diet was sterile at the onset of our experiment these resurging bacteria were most likely present in low abundance in the original gut microbiota of p. surinamensis and selected for on the strict fungal diet.

to test whether this pattern was driven by bacteria absent in p. surinamensis but present in the identity and number of otus within genus-level taxa that were present in some cockroaches feeding on leaf litter 0 fungus but absent in all cockroaches feeding on 100 fungal diet and their abundances across five colonies of odontotermes sp.

the reduced abundance of the genus within this study however may signal a decline in cockroach-specific lineages within the candidatus tammella genus as they are forced onto a more fungal-based diet .of the 14 otus that increased in abundance in cockroaches fed a 100 fungal diet the fir- micutes weissella 1 1.7 increase lactobacillus 4 1.6 and an unclassified otu in the pep- tostreptococcaceae 1.5 increased the most.

in contrast the main bacteria that con- stitute the p. surinamensis gut community such as enterococcaceae and lactobacillaceae remained in high abundances across all fungal dietary treatments potentially because they remain important on a fungal diet or because they serve functions unrelated to digestion.our findings are consistent with previous work of resilience of microbial communities in the face of disruption in insect gut microbiotas   including in cockroaches in which a distinct core community is maintained even in the face of fundamental dietary shifts   .

the cockroaches were fed leaf litter fruit and vegetables three times per week and the substrate within the container was replenished weekly until three days before initiation of the feeding experiment.diet experimentafter a two-week pre-feeding period individuals within the holding container were exposed to a control diet of only leaf litter for 72 hours and juveniles were subsequently isolated into sub- sets of 50 cockroaches within smaller experimental containers 21x17x15cm.

we observed a remarkably clear signal of diet-spe- cific effects on community structure with microbiota from cockroaches fed on the same diet more similar to each other than to those from cockroaches on different diets .

while the otus present in cockroaches on a 0 fun- gus diet appeared absent or low in abundance in 100 fungus-fed cockroaches and in odonto- termes sp.

it is unclear whether these bac- terial lineages were lost permanently or whether they were merely reduced below the detection limit of our taxon classification approach and would re-establish if a lignocellulose-based diet was reintroduced.bacterial taxa that are reduced in fungus-fed cockroaches such as members of the clostri- diales  may decline as they lose functional importance due to the altered diet regime.

comparison of the taxonomic composition of manipulated commu- nities to that of gut communities of a fungus-feeding termite species showed that although some bacteria otus shared by p. surinamensis and the farming termites increased in the guts of cockroaches on a fungal diet cockroach communities remained distinct from those of termites.
