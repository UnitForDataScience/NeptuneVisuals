For example evidence of alterations in choline tryptophan and energy metabolism can be seen in children with malnutrition as well as in the murine models noted below .Animal models environmental enteric dysfunctionAlthough never a substitute for careful clinical studies animal models can be very helpful in dissecting the roles of key patho- gens nutrient implications and mechanisms involved in these interacting causes of overt diarrhea growth or developmental impairment seen in children.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license .IntroductionEnteric diseases afflicting children in developing countries include acute and chronic diarrheal diseases enteric fever and the recently appreciated and still obscure disorder known as envi- ronmental enteric dysfunction EED.

These children were found to manifest delayed MAZ scores characteristic of younger children.

These results revealed a maturation of IgA targeting in children such that by 24 months of age the patterns in children were similar to those of their mothers.

IgA targeted bac- terial populations from the discordant twins were implanted into gnotobiotic mice mice colonized with the IgA-targeted bacteria from children with kwashiorkor grew poorly compared with mice implanted by bacteria from the healthy children.

Additional studies revealed that gnotobiotic mouse recipients of an IgA bacterial consortium purified from the gut microbiota of undernourished children exhibited intestinal histopathology characterized by disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and weight loss these effects were prevented by administering two IgA-targeted bacterial species from a healthy microbiota .The role of commensal microbiota in the growth of childrenAs noted above there exists a fairly reproducible succession of intestinal microbiota as children age.

Veillonella Streptococcus and Lactobacillus similarly diminish after the first two years .Investigators at the University of Maryland led by O. Colin Stine profiled the microbiota in the stools of 1300 children with moder- ate to severe diarrhea in the GEMS study compared with samples from 1735 matched control children without diarrhea.

Specifically children without L. salivarius in the stool had a very high risk of being symptomatic were infected with Shi- gella children with even low abundance of L. salivarius were pro- tected from Shigella-induced disease.
