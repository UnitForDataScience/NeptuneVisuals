This confirmed that the Selected and Control populations did not develop different microbiota communities Therefore any differences in responses between Selected and Control populations to microbiota would be unlikely to be due to differences in the microbiota communities with which they coevolved instead they would be driven by adaptation to different dietary regimes in the presence of similar microbiotas.As a consequence of evolutionary adaptation to poor diet over 170 generations larvae of our Selected populations had previously been reported to develop faster and survive better than Control larvae on a poor diet but not on a standard diet  .

Whereas Control larvae colonized with microbiota developed 40 faster and were three times more likely to survive on the poor diet than their GF siblings the corresponding effect of microbiota treatment onSelected larvae was much smaller and  for statistical analysis see Table S1 in the supplemental material.

The differential effects of microbiota on survival development and digestive enzyme activity of the Selected versus Control larvae reported above might result from differential coloniza- tion of their guts by the microbiota from the fecal transplant used as inoculum in these experiments.

Dependence on microbiota remained strong in our Control populations which originated from the same base population as the Selected popu- lations but did not have a history of evolution on the poor diet.The dependence of Drosophila larvae facing nutrient shortage on benefits provided by gut microbiota is known to be mediated at least in part by two major mechanisms enhanced digestion and induction of IIS and TOR signaling which regulate cell and tissue growth via the transcription factor dFOXO .

This suggests that evolution in response to nutrient shortage acted in part by releasing the larvae from dFOXO-mediated growth suppression modifying some of the same mechanisms that mediate responses to microbiota in nonadapted larvae.We also find that the expression of dFOXO itself is downregulated by association with microbiota as well as in Selected compared to Control populations.

Possibly in spite of the positive net effect of microbiota on Control larvae the microbiota may have competed with the host for nutrition on the poor diet which may have acted as a selective force for adaptation on the Selected populations to increase nutrient effi- ciency.

We show that protein and carbohydrate digestion in Selected larvae is much less affected by microbiota than in Controls in spite of the two types of larvae carrying microbiota of similar compositions and abundances.

Irrespective of this apparent decline over time colonization by microbiota strongly enhanced proteolysis in Control larvae but had a significantly smaller effect on proteolysis in Selected larvae as evidenced by the significant inter- action term in  P 0.005.

In the GF state the Selected larvae show a higher proteolytic activity at least in mid-third larval stage and lower amylase activity than GF Controls which parallels the effects of microbiota on Control larvae.

However we cannot exclude the possibility that carbohydrate metabolism in bacteria also influences the amount of monosaccharides present in the system and thus the feedback loops that control the activity and expression of these enzymes.Interestingly protease and amylase activity of Selected larvae is less strongly affected by microbiota than is the case for Control larvae.
