The lean and obese Zucker rats used in the study were generated by breeding a heterozygous female and heterozygous male so the lean and obese rats come from the same colony however the lean and obese rats were not siblings.

At the outset of the study the lean rats exhibited much lower ratios of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla than the obese rats but after 60 days this ratio in the lean rats exceeded that of the obese.

The rats were designated as members of the lean day 0 Le-0 lean day 60 Le-60 obese day 0 Ob-0 or obese day 60 Ob-60 groups.For the individual fecal samples the numbers of quality-filtered sequencing reads averaged 291531 per sample and ranged from 124247 to 441653 .

In the obese samples the predominant Bacteroidales families Bacteroidaceae and S24-7 showed little change between day 0 and day 60 5 and 11 reductions respectively while the lean samples showed reductions in the Bacteroidaceae S24- 7 and Paraprevotellaceae families of 42 71 and 95 respectively by day 60 .There are several bacterial groups that stand out as present in significantly different propor- tions in the lean and obese Zucker rats at 60 days-as identified by linear discriminant analysis .

As a group the greatest calculated diversity was found in the day 0 lean rats with an average Shannon index of 7.12 - 0.52 while the lowest diversity was observed in the day 60 lean rats Shannon index 6.33- 0.35.

Obese mice showed higher levels of Firmicutes and correspondingly lower levels of Bacteroidetes than their lean counterparts whether the obesity was genetically predisposed  or diet-LEfSe analysis identifying statistically significant differences in intestinal microbiota constituents of lean and obese Zucker rats on day 60.

For the Zucker rats in this study on day 0 the lean rats had much higher levels of Bacteroidetes and lower FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratios than the obese rats but by day 60 the ratios were similar for both lean and obese animals.These results contrast with a simplistic association of high FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratios with obesity that has been often reported.

exam- ined the microbial communities of 6 sets of fafa obese fa lean and  lean male Zucker rats that were housed together one of each strain in each set for 10 weeks in cages rather than the single cages as we used in this study.

Similar to the present study there was an increase in Rumincoccaceae among both lean and obese rats an increase in Bifidobacteriaceae seen in obese rats in the current study and a reduction of Bacteroidaceae seen in the lean rats in the current study as the rats aged.
