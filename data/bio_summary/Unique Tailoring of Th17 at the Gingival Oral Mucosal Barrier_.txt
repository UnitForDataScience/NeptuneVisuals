Are there unique functional capabilities exhibited by gingival-resident damage-induced Th17 cells compared to Th17 cells at other barriers As a product of their novel developmental program gingival Th17 cells may well exhibit unique functions specifi- cally supporting defense andor integrity of the gingival bar- rier.

Our understanding of Th17 cell specification in the GI tract does not end here the antigen-presenting cells that drive devel- opment of Th17 cells in this environment have also been defined.

Compared to mice aged on a normal diet those aged on the softened diet had a reduced population of Th17 cells whereas those aged on a hard diet exhibited increased proportions of Th17 cells.

Our data demonstrated that epithe- lial cells function as local gingival resident sentinels that pro- duce IL-6 in response to mechanical damage and therefore coordinated Th17 specification at this site.These data suggested that gingiva mechanical damage was the major driver promoting accumulation of Th17 cells.

Indeed we demonstrated that repeated damage to the skin could promote increases in local Th17 cells revealing the activity of this pathway even at a site where during steady state Th17 cells are dominantly educated by commensals.

Unlike other barrier sites such as the skin and gastrointestinal tract we found that Th17 cells can develop at the gingiva independently of commensal microbiota colonization.

Instead we identified that damage which occurs physiologically due to mastication promotes induction of Th17 cells and tones homeostatic immunity at the gingiva.Keywords oral immunity oral barrier barrier immunity periodontal immunity IL-17 masticationThe T-helper subset 17 Th17 and its signature cytokine inter- leukin IL-17 Amatya et al.
