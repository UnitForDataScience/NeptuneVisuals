The hypervariable region V4 of the 16S rDNA gene was targeted to explore richness and diversity of subgingival plaque samples 11.RESULTSIn this study we analyzed subgingival plaque samples of two patients with GAgP for shifts in the microbial community in response to mechanical debridement.

The intraoral photos and panoramic radiographs of two patients beforeand after treatment were shown in Figure S2 and FigureS3.Filtration and quality evaluation of original dataA total of 952272 V4 16s rDNA paired-end reads were obtained from the 16 samples the minimum and maximum numbers of reads from the 16 samples were 12564 and 100089 respectively Figure 1.

The second vertical axis OTUs Number represents the final OTU number after taxonomic analysis.Table 1 Comparison of the estimated operational taxonomic unit OTU richness diversity index and Simpson index of 16S rDNA gene libraries for clustering at 97 identity as obtained from the pyrosequencing analysis.G and Z represented the samples from the patient G and Z before treatment GT and ZT represented the samples from thepatient G and Z after treatment.which led to an increasing percentage of pathogenic microorganisms in microflora before treatment.

Some opportunistic pathogen increased after treatment which can not cause diseases in normal conditions.When comparing pre- and post-treatment samples we observed a shift in the composition of the oral microbiota supporting the well characterized transition from a Gram-negative dominated community in pre-treatment samples to a Gram-positive dominated community in post-treatment samples.

Both patients received full mouth scaling and root planning.Microbial samplingSubgingival plaque samples from mesio-buccal site of the first molar were obtained at baseline and at the four-week follow up so that a total of four samples before treatment and four samples after treatment for each patient were analyzed.

The overlap section represented the shared OTUs between different samples.Figure 3 The rarefraction curves of Shannon index A. and Chao1 index B.

The average length of the filtered sequence reads was 253 bp Table S2.Operational taxonomic unit-based analysisThe taxon abundance of all 16 samples was generated into 34 phyla 82 classes 127 orders 156 families and 187 genera.

The Shannon and Chao1 index curves of all samples reached plateaus with the current sequencing Figure 3A 3B suggesting that most richness and diversity had already been captured.

The samples of two patients before treatment aggregated in the same group while distracted after treatment which suggested that the bacterial composition of the two patients was similar before treatment but exhibited significant difference after treatment.

The samples in the group before treatment were well separated from those in the group after treatment based on the Weighted UniFrac distance measured at the OTU level.
