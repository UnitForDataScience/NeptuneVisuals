A human study involving fecal samples from four healthy children kept at room temperature for 12 2448 and 72 h reported a minor change in community structure over time A small but significant increase in diversity was identified after 12 h along with a de- crease in strains of Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium Corresponding changes were not noted in the present study with possible explanations being differ- ences in sample preparation as well as inter-species vari- ation in fecal microbiota composition.

The effects of different sampling and stor- age methods on the fecal bacterial population of healthy and diseased human subjects were examined Fecal samples were aliquoted within 10 min of defecation and stored at different temperatures -80 degC at -20 degC for a week at 4 degC for 24 h and at ambient temperature for 24 h. No significant differences were found in the num- ber of operational taxonomic units OTUs diversity or richness between the different storage temperatures  This study agreed with the results of previous studies but is in contradiction with others that reported a mild gradual difference in the fecal bacterial composition when samples were stored at ambient temperature for24 h compared to the composition assessed around defecation Studies evaluating the impact of storage conditions on fecal microbiota in companion an- imals are scarce.

Megasphaera was shown to play a dominant role in bacterial composition of the feline GI tract It isassociated with ruminal fermentation of lactate into short-chain fatty acids SCFA and is especially related to butyrate formation Due to its fermentation cap- acity the bacterium was shown to have beneficial effects on the GI health of some monogastric mammals However further research is required for the under- standing of the underlined role of Megasphaera in the cat an obligate carnivore especially when increased protein content may promote a steep decrease in Mega- sphaera abundance as well as jeopardise the GI micro- biota health While the extent of studies investigating the impact of storage on feline fecal microbiota has been limited the results of this study are similar to other studies that have shown limited or no impact of short-term storage.

The sample size wasrelatively small but it was based on a recent storage study in companion animals as well as on human storage studies that used a similar smaller sample size.

Since very little research exists on the effects of storage on fecal samples in general and even more so in cats more research is warranted prior to solid conclusions in regards to short-term fecal storage recommendations.ConclusionsThis study demonstrate that several-day-storage of healthy cats' feces at ambient temperature has no effect on microbial biodiversity.

Although sample freezing at-80 degC is recommended for long term storage the current study suggests that short term storage up to 4 days at ambient temperatures can be appropriate es- pecially when field studies are performed.Endnotes1Denver MAXX Denver Instrument Bohemia New York USA2Class II Type A2 Biosafety 283 Cabinet Thermo Fi-scher Scientific Waltham Massachusetts USA3E.Z.N.A.

The most readily apparent numerical difference was a decrease in the relative abundance over time of Mega- sphaera a genus of relatively fastidious anaerobes Therefore the trend for decreased Megasphaera abun- dance over time could correspond to air exposure during storage something that might have been accentuated by manual homogenization during preparation of fecal samples.

In comparison to this refrigeration study it would be expected that changes would occur prior to 7 days of storage at ambi- ent temperature which was not observed in the current study.
