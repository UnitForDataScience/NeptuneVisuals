dogs are grouped based on whether they had a fast weight loss rate 1 weight loss per week or a slow weight loss rate 1 weight loss per week between week 0 and week 6.

no significant differences were found in any relative abundance of the identified genera of the gm when comparing the fast and slow weight loss rate dogs at either week 0 or at week 6.for nine of the 12 dogs sufficient faecal material remained post-sequencing to analyse the faecal scfa content of paired samples from week 0 and 6.table 3. group exercise and diet fd or diet only do breed age sex and neutering female entire fe female neutered fn male entire me and male neutered mn body composition and weight loss rate for dogs n  12 undergoing a 12-week weight loss intervention including groupsbody condition score bcs on a scale from 1 to 9 and body fat percentage bf from week 0 and 12 previously included in vitger et al.

however megamonas abundance negatively correlated with weight loss rate and ruminococcaceae relative abundance was lower at 12 weeks in dogs with a faster weight loss rate 1 per week compared with slower weight loss rate 1 per week independent of exercise.

however weight loss rate was not a significant factor for the third pc3 or fourth pc4 principal components when analysed using an anova p  0.1. plotting of the first and second principal component did not yield any clustering related to the weight loss rate results not shown.discussionin this study we show that weight loss on a purpose- made weight loss diet seems to affect the gm in dogs independent of inclusion of moderate physical activ- ity.

the dogs having lost 1 bodyweight bw per week were classified as having a fast weight loss rate and the dogs having lost 1 bodyweight bw per week classified as having a slow weight loss rate.

although all the dogs were fed the same diet we were still able to identify a correlation between weight loss rate and the gm composition and faecaltable 4. faecal short chain fatty acid levels mean - sd in week 0 and 6 in dogs n  12 undergoing a 12 week weight loss trial comparing-32.4 to 29.0data was analysed using anova and reported as mean - sd p  0.05 in bold was considered a significant change.
