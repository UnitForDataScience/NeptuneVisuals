The three most significant differences comparing the gut microbiota GM as relative abundance OTUs at genus level between fast weight loss rate 1 of body weight per week and slow weight loss rate 1.0 bodyweight per week dogs at three time points week 0 week 6 and week 12 from dogs n  11 dur- ing a 12 week weight loss trial data was analysed using ANOVAP  0.05 in bold was considered a significant changeSix of the 12 dogs failed to reach the expected weight loss 1 of BW per week at 6 weeks and the amount of diet was therefore reduced at that point.

Correlation between the change in the Megamonas genus between week 0 and week 6 y-axis and the weight loss rate in per- centage per week x-axis in dogs n  8 undergoing a 12 week weight loss trial.From the remaining three dogs adequate faecal material was left to perform the SCFA analyses for 1 week 6 sample from 1 of the dogs and 2 week 12 samples from the other two dogs.

Additionally two samples were excluded from the bioinformatics and statistical anal- ysis of the GM composition due to low DNA concen- tration 1 week 6 and 1 week 12 sample from twodifferent dogs in the DO group and three samples due to number of reads being 10 000 reads per sam- ple 1 week 0 and 1 week 6 sample and 1 week 12 sample from one dog in the FD group.

Plot of the third PC3 and fourth PC4 principal components of the fast WL rate group 1 of body weight per week and slow WL rate group 1 of body weight per week between week 0 and week 6.

Dogs are grouped based on whether they had a fast weight loss rate 1 weight loss per week or a slow weight loss rate 1 weight loss per week between week 0 and week 6.

Faecal samples were collected and the dogs were weighed at week 0 week 6 and week 12.
