upon reduction the radical sam 4fe-4s1 cluster transfers one electron to sam which results in its reductive fragmentationand usually in the generation of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical 5'-da although this species has not been characterized.

37. to probe further the sequence and structuralrelationships between these enzymes we performed a phylogenetic analysis that included all the known radical sam epimerases and key representative members from the radical sam superfamily of enzymes 4a.

additional studies have shown that the activity of a mutated sp lyase could be rescued by precisely positioning a cysteine residue within the enzyme active site.nature chemistry  vol 9  july 2017  703fessfesfe21radical sam clusternh2fesh2oh oh sam2sfefesfessfenh2oh oh5'-dal-ilenchocys223d-allo-ilehncho2sfe2sfefesfesfesfesspasmclustersfesfehs3cys223cys223sfescys223figure 5  proposed mechanism of the radical sam peptide epimerase yydg.

altogether these results support that yydg uses one molecule of sam to epimerize one amino acid residue through a radical-based mechanism.yydg defines a novel type of radical sam epimerases present within the human microbiome.

this result supports that yydg introduced two modifications one located internally in peptide 2 and one in the c-terminus end of the peptide in peptide 3.to identify the nature and position of the modifications catalysed by yydg we repeated the reaction in 90 deuterated buffer because radical sam enzymes are known to abstract but also in some cases to exchange hydrogen atoms during catalysis.

why nature uses radical sam enzymes so widely electron nuclear double resonance studies of lysine 23-aminomutase show the 5'-dado 'free radical' is never free.

however it does not possess significant homology with any known radical sam enzyme.radical sam enzymes are emerging as a novel superfamily of enzymes that catalyse a broad range of radical-based reactions many of which having no precedent in biology.

this operon shows positive regu- lation on liars and possesses all the characteristic features of a genetic system that encodes a putative peptide yydf modified by a radical s-adenosyl-l-methionine sam enzyme yydg and a protease yydh.

among these five genes the function of the putative radical sam enzyme yydg was unclear but predicted to be a peptide-modifying enzyme.

to investigate the catalytic function of the putative radical sam enzyme yydg and the biological role of the yydf peptide we expressed the protein in e. coli and assayed its activity against yydf.
