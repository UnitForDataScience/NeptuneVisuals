A total of 21 patients were recruited trial registration ClinicalTrials.govNCT01154257 June 14 2010  and after receipt of informed and written consent from patients or relatives complying with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 these patients provided dental plaque NBL and ETT samples for analyses.

Most abundant species detected in ETT biofilms.dental plaque lower airway NBL and ETT lumen from mechanically ventilated patients.

Bacterial primers GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG 28F and TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT388R were used to generate multiple sequences of approximately 250 base pairs overlapping within the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.Table 1Demographics of the 12 patients participating in this studyThe initial reason for MV in 7 patients 5 8 10 14 21 24 25 was for a reduced conscious level and in the other 5 patients it was for respiratory failure as a result of pneumonia 3 20 27 or extrapulmonary sepsis 1 28.

Alpha and beta in- dices were calculated from these datasets with Mothur and R using the Vegan package.ResultsFrom the 12 participating patients 34 samples were obtained  with one dental plaque sample from each patient 12 ETTs from 10 patients and 10 NBLs from 7 patients.

As such maintenance of good oral hygiene is likely to be highly important in limiting aspiration of bacteria in this vulnerable patient group.c 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.IntroductionMechanical ventilation MV is an essential intervention in many critically ill patients and an endotracheal tube ETT is a key interface in this process.

Microorganisms may also be drawn into the inner lumen of the ETT where they grow as biofilms which may also serve as sources of VAP-causing agents which are large- ly protected from host defense mechanisms .Recent evidence has indicated that a microbial change may also occur in the dental plaque of MV patients .

Should components of the oral microbiota contribute to the ETT biofilm andor respiratory pathogens found to colonize the dental plaque further supporting evidence for maintaining high levels of oral hygiene in MV patients will have been provided.Materials and methodsCollection and processing of clinical specimensEthical approval for collection of clinical samples was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee for Wales Reference No.

Inclusion criteria were that patients had to be older than 18 years had more than 20 teeth and anexpectation of MV with an ETT for more than 24 hours.
