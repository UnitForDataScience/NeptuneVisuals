Future studies are therefore required to determine the specific mechanisms by which RORgt expression facilitates Treg cell suppression of specific subsets of T effector cells in the colon.Function of Colonic Treg CellsIntestinal Treg cells likely employ a number of mechanisms for regulating effector T cell responses to gut bacteria including cell surface proteins and cytokines reviewed in 17.

In addition the use of anti-CD25 antibodies may kill activated T cells or lead to gut inflammation which may alter the range of antigens presented to the immune system66.Thus while there is intriguing data suggesting that gut Treg cells induce IgA either directlyRussler-Germain et al.Page 12or serving as precursors for Foxp3- Tfh cells this Treg cell function during normal homeostasis requires further investigation.Moreover it has been argued that Treg cells actually inhibit B cell germinal center responses via the T follicular regulatory Tfr cell subset.

While the TCR transgenic transfer model is limited to the study of T cell intrinsic factors it permits analysis of Foxp3 induction proliferation migration and survival of T cells in a normal host during homeostasis.Bacterial Species Specificity of Colonic T CellsThe above discussion suggests that tolerance to intestinal bacteria is dependent on induction of Treg cells by intestinal bacteria.

However much remains to be learned about the characteristics of the bacteria that result in T and B cell responses during homeostasis and the T helper subset responses they elicit.Role for Treg cells in Induction or Suppression of IgAWith the exception of SFB there is a relative dearth of studies that integrate both T and B cell reactivity to intestinal bacteria at homeostasis.

However naive CT2CT6 T cells develop into effector T cells in Rag1-- lymphopenic mice.In contrast to the behavior of of CT2CT6 CBir1 antigen a component of flagella present in many gut bacteria species including those in Clostridium subphylum XIVa does not activate T cells or induce differentiation of Treg cells in lymphoreplete mice.

Further work in this area could have therapeutic implications for intestinal inflammatory diseases.Russler-Germain et al.Page 8Treg Cells Co-expressing Canonical Effector T Cell Transcriptions FactorsWhile certain environments described above skew T cell development away from Treg towards effector subsets normal Foxp3 Treg cells can upregulate effector transcription factors such as Tbet GATA3 and RORgt to provide additional functional capacity45.

Notably of the CD4 T cell population colonic Treg cells exhibit the greatest production of IL-10 based on the use of reporters94 and the expression of IL-10 is associated with co-expression of RORgt76.Induction of IL-10 in gut Treg cells has been reported to occur with microbiota-derived factors such as B. fragilis-derived PSA via a T cell intrinsic TLR2-dependent mechanism68.

For example treatment of experimental colitis with Treg cells was more effective using co- transfer of normal Treg cells plus naive Foxp3- conventional T cells Tconv cells that became pTreg cells than by co-transfer of Treg cells alone38.
