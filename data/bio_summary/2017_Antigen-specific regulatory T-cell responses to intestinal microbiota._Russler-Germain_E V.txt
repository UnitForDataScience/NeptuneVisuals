This process does not require a complex microbiota as introduction of individual bacterial isolates or defined consortia into germ-free mice is sufficient to induce colonic Treg cells22 23.One mechanism by which intestinal bacteria can influence Treg cell numbers is by inducing expansion of pre-existing thymic Treg tTreg cells.

For example treatment of experimental colitis with Treg cells was more effective using co- transfer of normal Treg cells plus naive Foxp3- conventional T cells Tconv cells that became pTreg cells than by co-transfer of Treg cells alone38.

Treg cells are observed in the cLP albeit in reduced number in germ free mice22 indicating that non-microbiota-dependent Treg cells can home to and survive in colonic tissue.Studies of individual bacterial species transferred into germ-free mice support the concept that colonic Treg cells can be specific to bacteria.

Thus Treg cells co- expressing GATA3 or Tbet do not appear to play an integral part in the response to commensal bacteria during homeostasis.By contrast the colon is normally highly enriched in Treg cells that express the canonical Th17 transcription factor RORgt 30-80 which is expressed in only 10-20 of Treg cells in the small intestine76 77 79 80.

RORgt Treg cells express high levels of IL-10 and CTLA-476 consistent with activated Treg cells with increased immunoregulatory capability80.The process by which RORgt Treg cells are generated appears to be dependent on certain bacteria.

Future studies are therefore required to determine the specific mechanisms by which RORgt expression facilitates Treg cell suppression of specific subsets of T effector cells in the colon.Function of Colonic Treg CellsIntestinal Treg cells likely employ a number of mechanisms for regulating effector T cell responses to gut bacteria including cell surface proteins and cytokines reviewed in 17.

In addition the use of anti-CD25 antibodies may kill activated T cells or lead to gut inflammation which may alter the range of antigens presented to the immune system66.Thus while there is intriguing data suggesting that gut Treg cells induce IgA either directlyRussler-Germain et al.Page 12or serving as precursors for Foxp3- Tfh cells this Treg cell function during normal homeostasis requires further investigation.Moreover it has been argued that Treg cells actually inhibit B cell germinal center responses via the T follicular regulatory Tfr cell subset.

Treg cells are defined by the transcription factor Foxp3 which is required for Treg cell function and development17.

In humans patients with Treg cell deficiency IPEX immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked exhibit diarrhea and at times colitis amongst other autoimmune disease manifestations17.Thus Treg cell-mediated tolerance to gut bacteria is crucial for maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of IBD.We will review our current understanding of the reciprocal interactions of T cells and intestinal bacteria during homeostasis.

Specifically we will discuss the roles of intestinal bacteria in shaping tolerogenic Treg cell responses via non-antigen-specific factors as well as address how antigen-specificity appears to be important for intestinal Treg cell development and function.
