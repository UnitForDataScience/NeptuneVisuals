therefore modulation of gut microbiota through diet antibiotics prebiotics probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation fmt represent at least theoretically a promising therapeutic avenue for the management of inflammatory bowel disease although available evidence suggest that fine tuning of our therapeutic offerings is still needed figure 1.32 being able to harness this potential is the fundamental basis of emerging therapeu- tic approaches to inflammatory bowel disease management with microbial modulation becoming a major consideration in inflamma- tory bowel disease management over the last decade.potential drawbacks of most of the current literature in terms of defining microbial changes in inflammatory bowel disease are that studies have primarily reported on cohorts with established disease and they often fail to appreciate that mucosal and faecal microbiota are different.

nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel diseasethe use of supportive nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease is outside the scope of this review which will instead focus on the use of nutrition as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease and the microbial signals that emerge from its use.

a mucosa-based study on 23 cd adult patients also demonstrated similar findings.60sokol et al recently published a larger faecal-based adult inflam-matory bowel disease study comprising 235 well-phenotyped inflam- matory bowel disease subjects and 38 healthy subjects.61 they identified a disease-specific fungal dysbiosis with shifts in composi- tion involving the 2 dominant fungal phyla and several fungal spe- cies including s. cerevisiae malassezia sympodialis and c. albicans.

microbiota as a therapeutic target in inflammatory boweldisease  antibioticsgenerally antimicrobial drugs are known to influence the natural his- tory of several disorders including inflammatory bowel disease by modulating the host microbiota which in turn drives beneficial or harmful consequences in clinical practice.6263 antibiotics can poten- tially ameliorate the microbial environment of patients with inflam- matory bowel disease both by decreasing proinflammatory bacteria and by increasing beneficial ones throughout the intestinal lumen.64 several antimicrobial drugs have been investigated in patients with ulcerative colitis for the induction andor maintenance of disease remission.

these include direct activity against c. difficile by the bacteria in the donated sample and restoration of sec- ondary bile acid metabolism.129 interestingly the notion that the bacteria in the donated sample play an indispensable role in the effi- cacy of fmt recently came into question in the light of a clinical case series that reported that sterile faecal filtrate was also effective in treating patients with c. difficile infection.130the success of fmt as a treatment for recurrent c. difficile infec- tion has prompted a surge of interest in evaluating its efficacy as a treatment intervention in other diseases and disorders where pertur- bations to the microbiota are thought to play a role in pathogenesis and severity including inflammatory bowel disease where the first case report was published in 1989.131 since then some authors have reported positive results132-141 others have reported variable results or no observed clinical improvement.142-145 the strongest evidence for fmt in inflammatory bowel disease comes from 4 double-blind randomised control trials136137142146 all of which were performed on patients with ulcerative colitis.

such food microbiome research particularly coupled with disease activityflaredata represents an important unmet need in inflammatory bowel disease.the potential utility of nutrition as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease was first demonstrated in an observational study by voitk et al who recognised that use of an elemental diet prevented the need for surgery in some patients where operative management was planned.158 while this observation prompted an initial interest in elemental and semi-elemental protein sources in early trials of exclusive enteral nutrition including the seminal control trials from o'morain et al and from sanderson et al.

the implication of this interplay between humans and microbes is that pharmacological therapies nutrient modifications and associated interventions that are targeted at the host will also significantly impact on the gut microbiota.genome-wide association studies gwas have now identified 235 inflammatory bowel disease ibd-associated susceptibility loci substantially expanding our understanding of the biology underlying these diseases.89 early genetic studies focused on searching protein coding sequences although it is now recognised that coding variation explains only 20 of genetic variation associated with ibd gwas loci.10 these studies highlighted the pivotal role of hostmicrobial interactions in ibd pathogenesis specifically identifying t-cell activa- tion il-23t helper 17 pathway autophagy and microbial recogni- tion.11-13 the most recent studies have undertaken low-coverage whole genome sequencing to interrogate low-frequency variants and define how much these variants contribute to ibd susceptibility.

this approach has identified a missense variant in adcy7 with mechanistic interpretation being that loss of function reduces camp production leading to an excessive inflammatory response that predisposes to ulcerative colitis but not crohn's disease cd.8 defining the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease a change in the normal gut microbiota with a shift away from hostmi- crobial mutualism has been reported in many ibd studies however the vast majority of studies to date have focussed on bacterial changes and only recently has consideration of fungal and viral constituents been forthcoming.

some bacterial changes appear to be clearly linked to either cd or ulcerative colitis while others appear to be attributed more generally to ibd.14-20 the most consistent changes are reduction in biodiversity lower number of species with lower proportions of firmicutes consistently reported alongside increases in proteobacte- ria1621-24 and bacteroidetes phylum members19 although reductions have also been reported.15 spatial re-organisation of bacteroides spe- cies has also been documented with higher proportions of bacteroidesfragilis being seen in ibd patients.20 in cd changes in firmicutes have particularly documented changes in faecalibacterium prausnitzii.25 fae- calibacterium prausnitzii levels have been consistently lower in ileal cd patients although increases were noted in paediatric cd potentially suggesting that further assessment is required.26-28 additional interro- gation of f. prausnitzii has identified that f. prausnitzii populations are patient-specific and there are differing functional capabilities between strains with the tantalising potential that differing phylotypes may be having opposing effects.28increases in proteobacteria especially escherichia coli including pathogenic variants are also reported in ileal cd.29 changes in bac- terial functional capabilities have been seen in ileal cd with alter- ations in bacterial carbohydrate metabolism bacterialhost interactions and host secreted enzymes noted.30 perturbations to the structure of the gut microbiota termed dysbiosis have also been shown to impart functional changes within the host creating a pro-inflammatory state.31 more broadly microbial functional changes associated with inflammatory bowel disease have identified enrich- ment in host metabolite uptake oxidative stress tolerance and immune evasion alongside decreases in microbial metabolism including short chain fatty acid scfa biosynthesis and amino acid biosynthesis.

modulation of gut microbiota through diet antibiotics prebiotics probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation which reflects the existing microbial therapeutic avenues for inflammatory bowel disease management.

veillonellaceae neisseriaceae and fusobacteriaceae.34 taken collectively these studies highlight that the microbiota changes associated with treatment naive new-onset inflammatory bowel disease are different from established disease and require additionalfurther consideration.

serial follow-up of such patient cohorts potentially offers a unique opportunity to study the purest profile of inflammatory bowel disease-related microbiota changes.

less diverse microbiota profiles have been demonstrated in ulcerative colitis patient samples and in particular the finding of increased clostridium perfringens in faeces suggests a role in disease exacerbation.41 a decrease in fusicatenibacter saccharivorans in patients with active ulcerative colitis has also been reported in con- trast to the increase observed in patients with quiescent disease.42 the role of the virome newer methodological techniques in the metagenomic assessment of the gut virome as a composite entity has opened new avenues in our understanding of its role in the aetiopathogenesis of inflamma- tory bowel disease.
