Biofilms facilitate the invasion of the mucous layer and a study by Dejea et al.found that biofilms were present in 90 of right-sided CRC all of the CMS1 tumours in our study were right sided.We also performed targeted analysis of two further oral bacteria P. micra and P. stomatis in our CRC cohort.These bacterial species have been identified in metagenomics studies as markers of CRC using faecal samples and have been described in an oral-microbe-induced colorectal tumorigenesis model proposed by Flynn et al.. Interestingly a recent microbiome study by Flemer et al.of CRC tumour and matched faecal samples found significantly elevated abundance of Fusobacterium Peptostreptococcus or Parvimonas only in a subset of 20-30 of CRC patients.

A more detailed analysis of bacterial taxa using non-human RNA-sequencing reads uncovered distinct bacterial communities associated with each molecular subtype.

The 15 most highly abundant bacterial genera as a percentage of the total bacterial genera for each consensus molecular subtype CMS as calculated using RNA-seq metagenomics.Figure 4.

SD standard deviation..Analysis of bacterial taxa for each molecular subtype uncovered distinct bacterial communities associated with each CMS subtype Fig.

We used each sample within a given subtype as a replicate of that subtype and ran edgeR v3.14.0 to compare each subtype against all other samples not in the CMS subtype e.g.

Future directions would include testing of qPCR panels in a large independent sample set prior to molecular classification using RNA-sequencing and investigating the utility of these bacterial markers in non-invasive faecal-based tests.ConclusionsIn conclusion due to the potentially modifiable nature of gut bacteria identifying the role of particular bacterial species in CRC development could have implications for cancer prevention.

Although bacterial dysbiosis as shown through 16S rRNA and metagen- omics studies have previously been associated with CRC compared to controls    and a recent study by Burns et al.has linked microbial composition with loss-of-function mutations in tumours this is the first time that different bacterial signatures have been shown to associate with molecular subtypes of CRC.Increased carriage of Fusobacterium nucleatum has been frequently associated with CRC-.

We classified 34 tumours into CRC subtypes using RNA-sequencing derived gene expression and determined relative abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups using 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding.

Using edgeR Bioconductor pack- age v3.14.0 we identified bacterial taxa whose abundances are considerably different among CMS subtypes.In this analysis for each CRC sample we used the assigned CMS subtype together with a list of bacterial taxa identified by Kraken and corresponding read counts per taxa as input data.

up- or down-regulation as input and calculated a P-value for enrichment of the gene-set in biological categories using Fisher's exact test for count data fisher.test method in R. All P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false-discovery adjustment method from Benjamini  Hochberg using R-method p.adjust more informa- tion can be found at .
