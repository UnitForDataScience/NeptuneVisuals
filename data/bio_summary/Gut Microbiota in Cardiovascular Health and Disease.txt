Microbial sequencing analysis has provided a wealth of in- formation about the presence of characteristic gut microbiota associated with CVD.3-5 Also a growing body of evidence shows that manipulation of the composition of gut microbiota affects host metabolism.67 Furthermore recent studies sug- gest that gut microbiota produce numerous metabolites some of which are absorbed into the systemic circulation and are biologically active whereas others are further metabolized by host enzymes and then serve as a mediator of microbial influ- ence on the host.8-13 Thus the gut microbiome functioning as a virtual endocrine system communicates with distal organsthrough metabolism-dependent pathways.8-1114-22 This review will discuss the roles of gut microbiota in normal physiology their associations with disease settings and the potential of modulating gut microbiota as novel therapeutic targets with particular emphasis on the complex interplay between micro- biota their metabolites and CVD Figure 1.Role of Gut Microbiota in Host Physiology The human body is inhabited by a huge number of bacteria archaea viruses and unicellular eukaryotes.23 The collec- tion of microorganisms that live in coexistence with their hosts has been referred to as the microbiota.

Although a direct antimicrobial effect of BAs has been described in vitro116 it is still unclear whether BA-mediated microbiota alterations are a direct effect of BAs on the bacteria or whether cross talk with the intestinal mucosa is involved.DyslipidemiaRecent studies suggest that the gut microbiota can mechanis- tically impact host lipid levels.89125-127 Independent of body mass index and other metabolic disturbances associations between levels of circulating triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol with gut microbiota have been report- ed.125 Although the underlying biological mechanisms through which gut microbiota or their metabolites can impact host lipid metabolism has not been enumerated secondary BAs which are produced by gut microbiota have been suggested to modulate both hepatic and systemic lipid metabolism aswell as glucose metabolism through FXR and GPR131.171844 In addition some of the proatherogenic effects of TMAO are linked to reduction in reverse cholesterol transport alteration in tissue cholesterol and sterol metabolism and changes in BA composition pool size and transport in both the liver and in- testines.9 Furthermore genetic manipulation of the expression of host hepatic FMO3 has been shown to elicit alterations in plasma lipid levels and hepatic lipid metabolism126127 suggest- ing a major role for FMO3 in modulating lipid homeostasis.Chronic Kidney DiseaseCardiovascular and kidney CKD diseases are closely inter- related and the so-called cardiorenal syndrome is associated with poor clinical outcomes.128 People with CKD have a great- er risk of CVD-related mortality.129 The increased CVD risk is only partially explained by traditional cardiovascular risk fac- tors and there is increasing evidence that nontraditional risk factors such as inflammation oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction play a key role.130It is well known that the composition of gut microbiota is markedly altered in patients with CKD leading to an in- flux of circulating urea and other uremic toxins into the gut lumen.131132 Within the intestinal tract urea is hydrolyzed by microbial urease to form large quantities of ammonia which is then converted to ammonium hydroxide.

Instead of fecal contents the transplantation of only a defined group of bacteria may be a rational alternative to FMT.148Diet InterventionA dietary approach to nutritional interventions in CVD had proved to be an effective strategy in reducing cardiovascular risk.149150 In a comprehensive study involving 900 partici- pants diet-dependent postprandial blood glucose levels werecorrelated with individual gut microbiota composition.151 Although the composition of the microbiota is resilient over an individual's life span152153 dietary interventions that induce rapid changes in certain nutrients can modify the microbiota composition.154155 Changes in Roseburia and E. rectale have been observed with changes in the proportion of carbohydrate content in the diet.156157 Fiber-rich diets promote the growth of beneficial commensal bacteria and limit the growth of known opportunistic pathogens.158 A high-fiber diet was re- ported to increase acetate-producing microbiota lower blood pressure and decrease cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.159 A recent study has shown that dietary intervention with whole grains traditional Chinese medicinal foods and prebiotics resulted in improvement in insulin sensitivity and lipid pro- file with concomitant reduction of opportunistic pathogen of the Enterobacteriaceae family and increase in the family Bifidobacteriaceae a taxa generally regarded as gut barrier protecting.160 In addition bacterial fermentation of prebiotic soluble fiber generates SCFA which is thought to exert sever- al beneficial effects including potential amelioration of CVD risk factors.12161162Given that an alteration in gut microbiota composition has been linked to different diseases modulation of gut micro- biota composition through dietary intervention represents a promising therapeutic target.

Gut microbiota constitute and regulate the intestinal mucosal barriers control nutrient uptake and metabolism assist with maturation of immunologic tissues and prevent propagation of pathogenic microorganisms.26-30 Under physiological conditions gut microbiota continue to stimulate the immune system which is a rapid and effective mechanism for defending against pathogens.31 Collectively the microbiota exert a fundamental influence on systemic im- munity and metabolism and healthy gut microbiota are large- ly responsible for the overall health of the host.23Pathogenic Mechanism of Gut Microbiota and Metabolites in Cardiometabolic DiseasesAltered Composition of Gut MicrobiotaThe majority of the gut microbial community is composed of only 5 phyla Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Actinobacteria Proteobacteria and Cerrucomicrobia.32 However there is considerable diversity on the species level and their relativeTable.

In a recent study a widely distributed family of tryptophanases in the gut commensal Bacteroides was identi- fied as a primary and rate-limiting source of indoxyl sulfate in human gut bacteria moreover modulating the content of the gut microbes harboring the tryptophanases was shown to substantially impact indoxyl sulfate levels in vivo.138 In clini- cal studies levels of this and other uremic toxins have been shown to be associated with angiographic coronary athero- sclerosis severity.139 Collectively there is significant evidence suggesting that the gut could be a target of treatment of CKD in conjunction with efforts to improve dialysis techniques to better remove microbially generated uremic toxins.TMAO has been known to accumulate in the plasma of patients with CKD and higher TMAO levels were associated with higher mortality and progressive loss of kidney func- tion.59-61 Data from the Framingham Heart Study indicated that TMAO was one of the few metabolites in the plasma of healthy subjects whose levels predicted incident developmentof CKD.140 In addition we observed enhanced renal fibrosis and decreased renal function with choline-rich diet supple- mentation.59 It is clear that further studies exploring the physi- ology of TMAO generation and metabolism are warranted to more thoroughly define the cause of TMAO elevations in CKD.Therapeutic InterventionThe many links between the altered gut microbial commu- nity metabolites and susceptibility for CVD and metabolic diseases has placed a spotlight on the gut microbiome as a potential novel target for therapeutics.

Studies using angiotensin II-infused germ-free mice showed that gut microbiota participate in an- giotensin II-induced vascular dysfunction and hypertension.71 Recent study showed a blood pressure-lowering effect in a pa- tient with treatment-resistant hypertension when treated with a combination of antibiotics.69 Higher abundance of the butyrate- producing genus Odoribacter was associated with lower blood pressure in overweight and obese pregnant women.72 These data suggest a strong association between gut microbial dysbiosis and hypertension pathology.SCFAs which are other important signals generated bythe gut microbiota have been recently shown to modulate blood pressure.11 SCFAs are a major product from the mi- crobial fermentative activity in the gut and are likely to have broad impacts on various aspects of host physiology as well as to impact disease susceptibility.73 SCFAs can function to stimulate host G-protein-coupled receptor GPR pathways that impact renin secretion and blood pressure regulation.11 A series of studies using the renal and vascular olfactory re- ceptor Olfr 78 and GPR41 knockout mice further supports involvement of these receptors in blood pressure control.

Recently a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota and the severity of myocardial infarction has been reported in rats.5152 Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics was shown to affect levels of leptin and analytes produced during aromatic amino acid catabolism with associated reduced myocardial infarct size.5152 In addition in rodent model studies administration of Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with significant reduction in infarct size and improved left ventricular func- tion after myocardial infarction.51 Another animal model study showed that administration of the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and heart fail- ure after experimental myocardial infarction.53 These obser- vations may suggest that probiotics use in combination with standard medication could offer additional benefits in patients with heart failure such as reducing the severity of heart failureafter myocardial infarction.In addition to the alterations in gut microbiota compo- sition the metabolic potential of gut microbiota has been identified as a contributing factor in CVD development.

Although few studies have linked gut microbial signatures to hypertension in humans recently early studies showed germ- free rats have an elevated blood pressure implicating a role for gut microbiota in blood pressure regulation.66 More recently a limited number of studies indicate a direct association between gut microbiota and blood pressure control in animal models.67-70 Yang et al67 compared alterations in the fecal microbiota in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and chronic angiotensin II- infusion rat models of hypertension.

In addition to gut microbiota taxa characteristics of oral microbiota have also been detected in atherosclerotic plaque in humans.3 Given the many epidemiological links between periodontal disease and CVD47-49 a role for oral microbiota in the pathophysiology of CVD has also been studied.34950 Metagenomic sequencing of stool microbiota revealed that the microbial composition is altered in patients with unstable versus stable plaques with unstable plaque associated with reduced fecal levels of the genus Roseburiam and both increased theoretical capacity of the microbiome to produce proinflammatory peptidoglycans and reduced production of anti-inflammatory carotenes.4 The gut microbiome of patients with CVD may thus be fostering inflammation by producing more proinflammatory molecules.

In contrast germ-free mice and short- term antibiotic suppression of gut microbiota eliminated TMAO-generating capacity and the latter reduced athero- sclerotic burden.8 These effects were not unique to choline or phosphatidylcholine but have similarly been observed with other dietary nutrients that can generate TMAO downstream including l-carnitine and g-butyrobetaine.955 Comparison of both intestinal microbiota composition and function between omnivores and vegansvegetarians revealed stark differences in gut microbial capacity to produce TMA and TMAO from dietary l-carnitine with vegetarians and vegans having mini- mal capacity to form TMA from carnitine.9 Furthermore stud- ies using poorly orally absorbed antibiotics coupled with the use of dietary intake of isotope-labeled phosphatidylcholine have showed a direct demonstration of an obligatory role for gut microbes in TMAO generation in humans.22The association of TMAO levels and adverse clinical consequences has been shown in numerous independent co- horts.8225459-62 The original human studies of 1800 patients with stable cardiac undergoing elective coronary angiography demonstrated that all TMAO-associated metabolites--cho- line betaine and l-carnitine--had a positive association with prevalent CVDs and incident cardiovascular events.8 Of these 3 compounds circulating TMAO levels exhibited a positive correlation with atherosclerotic plaque size whereas triglyc- eride lipoproteins fasting glucose and hepatic triglycerides did not.8 In a subsequent study of 4000 subjects undergo- ing elective coronary angiography elevated TMAO levels were associated with increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events including death myocardial infarction and stroke over a 3-year follow-up period.22 Specifically pa- tients in the highest quartile of circulating TMAO levels had a 2.5-fold increased risk of having a major adverse cardiovascu- lar events compared with those in the lowest quartile.22 Such prognostic value was independent of traditional cardiac risk factors lipid parameters C-reactive protein and even renal function and the hazard ratio for TMAO was much higher than for traditional risk factors such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.22 Since these initial studies numerous additional reports have shown associations between TMAO levels and incident CVD risks.2259-62 Circulating TMAO was associated with the presence of vulnerable coronary plaque plaque rup- ture and long-term risks of incident cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome.6364 Mechanistic studies in animal model studies also reveal that TMAO alters platelet calcium signaling and elicits a prothrombotic effect in vivo.10 These observations suggest that TMAO could be a marker for coronary plaque vulnerability and progression and a direct participant in enhanced risk for myocardial infarction.
