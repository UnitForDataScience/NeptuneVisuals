microbial sequencing analysis has provided a wealth of in- formation about the presence of characteristic gut microbiota associated with cvd.3-5 also a growing body of evidence shows that manipulation of the composition of gut microbiota affects host metabolism.67 furthermore recent studies sug- gest that gut microbiota produce numerous metabolites some of which are absorbed into the systemic circulation and are biologically active whereas others are further metabolized by host enzymes and then serve as a mediator of microbial influ- ence on the host.8-13 thus the gut microbiome functioning as a virtual endocrine system communicates with distal organsthrough metabolism-dependent pathways.8-1114-22 this review will discuss the roles of gut microbiota in normal physiology their associations with disease settings and the potential of modulating gut microbiota as novel therapeutic targets with particular emphasis on the complex interplay between micro- biota their metabolites and cvd figure 1.role of gut microbiota in host physiology the human body is inhabited by a huge number of bacteria archaea viruses and unicellular eukaryotes.23 the collec- tion of microorganisms that live in coexistence with their hosts has been referred to as the microbiota.

although a direct antimicrobial effect of bas has been described in vitro116 it is still unclear whether ba-mediated microbiota alterations are a direct effect of bas on the bacteria or whether cross talk with the intestinal mucosa is involved.dyslipidemiarecent studies suggest that the gut microbiota can mechanis- tically impact host lipid levels.89125-127 independent of body mass index and other metabolic disturbances associations between levels of circulating triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol with gut microbiota have been report- ed.125 although the underlying biological mechanisms through which gut microbiota or their metabolites can impact host lipid metabolism has not been enumerated secondary bas which are produced by gut microbiota have been suggested to modulate both hepatic and systemic lipid metabolism aswell as glucose metabolism through fxr and gpr131.171844 in addition some of the proatherogenic effects of tmao are linked to reduction in reverse cholesterol transport alteration in tissue cholesterol and sterol metabolism and changes in ba composition pool size and transport in both the liver and in- testines.9 furthermore genetic manipulation of the expression of host hepatic fmo3 has been shown to elicit alterations in plasma lipid levels and hepatic lipid metabolism126127 suggest- ing a major role for fmo3 in modulating lipid homeostasis.chronic kidney diseasecardiovascular and kidney ckd diseases are closely inter- related and the so-called cardiorenal syndrome is associated with poor clinical outcomes.128 people with ckd have a great- er risk of cvd-related mortality.129 the increased cvd risk is only partially explained by traditional cardiovascular risk fac- tors and there is increasing evidence that nontraditional risk factors such as inflammation oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction play a key role.130it is well known that the composition of gut microbiota is markedly altered in patients with ckd leading to an in- flux of circulating urea and other uremic toxins into the gut lumen.131132 within the intestinal tract urea is hydrolyzed by microbial urease to form large quantities of ammonia which is then converted to ammonium hydroxide.

gut microbiota constitute and regulate the intestinal mucosal barriers control nutrient uptake and metabolism assist with maturation of immunologic tissues and prevent propagation of pathogenic microorganisms.26-30 under physiological conditions gut microbiota continue to stimulate the immune system which is a rapid and effective mechanism for defending against pathogens.31 collectively the microbiota exert a fundamental influence on systemic im- munity and metabolism and healthy gut microbiota are large- ly responsible for the overall health of the host.23pathogenic mechanism of gut microbiota and metabolites in cardiometabolic diseasesaltered composition of gut microbiotathe majority of the gut microbial community is composed of only 5 phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes actinobacteria proteobacteria and cerrucomicrobia.32 however there is considerable diversity on the species level and their relativetable.

instead of fecal contents the transplantation of only a defined group of bacteria may be a rational alternative to fmt.148diet interventiona dietary approach to nutritional interventions in cvd had proved to be an effective strategy in reducing cardiovascular risk.149150 in a comprehensive study involving 900 partici- pants diet-dependent postprandial blood glucose levels werecorrelated with individual gut microbiota composition.151 although the composition of the microbiota is resilient over an individual's life span152153 dietary interventions that induce rapid changes in certain nutrients can modify the microbiota composition.154155 changes in roseburia and e. rectale have been observed with changes in the proportion of carbohydrate content in the diet.156157 fiber-rich diets promote the growth of beneficial commensal bacteria and limit the growth of known opportunistic pathogens.158 a high-fiber diet was re- ported to increase acetate-producing microbiota lower blood pressure and decrease cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.159 a recent study has shown that dietary intervention with whole grains traditional chinese medicinal foods and prebiotics resulted in improvement in insulin sensitivity and lipid pro- file with concomitant reduction of opportunistic pathogen of the enterobacteriaceae family and increase in the family bifidobacteriaceae a taxa generally regarded as gut barrier protecting.160 in addition bacterial fermentation of prebiotic soluble fiber generates scfa which is thought to exert sever- al beneficial effects including potential amelioration of cvd risk factors.12161162given that an alteration in gut microbiota composition has been linked to different diseases modulation of gut micro- biota composition through dietary intervention represents a promising therapeutic target.

in addition to gut microbiota taxa characteristics of oral microbiota have also been detected in atherosclerotic plaque in humans.3 given the many epidemiological links between periodontal disease and cvd47-49 a role for oral microbiota in the pathophysiology of cvd has also been studied.34950 metagenomic sequencing of stool microbiota revealed that the microbial composition is altered in patients with unstable versus stable plaques with unstable plaque associated with reduced fecal levels of the genus roseburiam and both increased theoretical capacity of the microbiome to produce proinflammatory peptidoglycans and reduced production of anti-inflammatory carotenes.4 the gut microbiome of patients with cvd may thus be fostering inflammation by producing more proinflammatory molecules.

the microbiota colonize mainly in the gastrointestinal tract especially in the colon that is primarily anaerobic and has a rich nutrient en- vironment serving as a preferred site for intestinal microbial colonization.gut microbiota participate in food digestion through 2 main catabolic pathways categorized as saccharolytic or pro- teolytic.24 in the saccharolytic pathway gut microbiota break down sugars and are responsible for the majority of short- chain fatty acid scfa production.

in some cases these signaling molecules are a struc- tural component of microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycans that interact with host mucosal surface cells often through the so-called pattern recognition receptors.39 pattern recognition receptors recognize pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns which stimulate and instruct host immune response.40 thus lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycans can trigger numerous downstream signaling processes with host receptors both at the epithelial cell border and within vascu- lature particularly under conditions when gut wall barrier function is impaired.4142 gut microbiota can also impact host processes via bioactive metabolites that can affect distal or- gans directly or indirectly.43 gut microbiota interact with the host through many pathways including the trimethylamine tmatrimethylamine n-oxide tmao pathway scfas pathway and primary and secondary bile acid ba path- ways.8-1114-22 some of these molecules have been shown to functionally interact with other endocrine hormones includ- ing ghrelin leptin glucagon-like peptide 1 glp-1 and pep- tide yy pyy.4445 others have been reported to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system thereby impacting glucose homeostasis and other metabolic processes linked to develop- ment of metabolic syndrome.46atherosclerosis coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctionatherosclerotic plaques contain bacterial dna and the bacte- rial taxa observed in atherosclerotic plaques were also presentin the gut of the same individuals.338 these observations sug- gest the possibility that the microbial communities at these sites may be a source of bacteria in the plaque which may impact plaque stability and development of cvd.

recently a mechanistic link between the gut microbiota and the severity of myocardial infarction has been reported in rats.5152 use of broad-spectrum antibiotics was shown to affect levels of leptin and analytes produced during aromatic amino acid catabolism with associated reduced myocardial infarct size.5152 in addition in rodent model studies administration of lactobacillus plantarum was associated with significant reduction in infarct size and improved left ventricular func- tion after myocardial infarction.51 another animal model study showed that administration of the lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and heart fail- ure after experimental myocardial infarction.53 these obser- vations may suggest that probiotics use in combination with standard medication could offer additional benefits in patients with heart failure such as reducing the severity of heart failureafter myocardial infarction.in addition to the alterations in gut microbiota compo- sition the metabolic potential of gut microbiota has been identified as a contributing factor in cvd development.

although few studies have linked gut microbial signatures to hypertension in humans recently early studies showed germ- free rats have an elevated blood pressure implicating a role for gut microbiota in blood pressure regulation.66 more recently a limited number of studies indicate a direct association between gut microbiota and blood pressure control in animal models.67-70 yang et al67 compared alterations in the fecal microbiota in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and chronic angiotensin ii- infusion rat models of hypertension.
