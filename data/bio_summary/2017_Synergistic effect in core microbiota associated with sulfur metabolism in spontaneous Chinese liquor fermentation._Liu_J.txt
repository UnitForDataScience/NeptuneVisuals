here in a spontaneous chinese liquor fermen- tation system we found a novel microbial interaction between saccharomyces and lactobacillus in which lactobacillus recycled methionine the precursor of sulfur com- pounds for saccharomyces leading to an increase in the production of sulfur com- pounds.conclusion.

the increase in the concentrations of 3-methylthio-1-propanol and dimethyl disulfide might result from increased expression of genes involved in methionine biosynthesis and methionine catabolism.

these results indicate that s. cerevisiae increases the expression of genes for the generation of 3-methylthio-1-propanol and dimethyl disulfide in the presence of l. buchneri which can regenerate the precursor methionine for methionine catabolism and they reveal anovel synergistic effect between these two strains.interactions between saccharomyces and lactic acid bacteria occur in dairy food and beverage fermentation .

this work revealed a synergistic effectbetween saccharomyces and lactobacillus in which saccharomyces played a crucial role in the generation of 3-methylthio-1-propanol and dimethyl disulfide and lactobacillus regenerated methionine and sam for s. cerevisiae.

saccharomyces transcribed genes encoding 23 enzymes related to the generation of 3-methylthio- 1-propanol and dimethyl disulfide and lactobacillus was active in the methyl cycle which recycles methionine the precursor of the two sulfur compounds.

our findings can contribute to the enhancement of aroma characteristics in chinese liquor and open new avenues for improving various food and alcoholic bever- age fermentation processes.december 2017 volume 83 issue 24 e01475-17applied and environmental microbiology 1keywords chinese liquor core microbiota metatranscriptomic microbial interaction sulfur metabolism synergistic effecthinese liquor is one of the oldest and most famous alcoholic beverages all over the world  .
