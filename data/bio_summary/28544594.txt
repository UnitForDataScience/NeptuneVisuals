the chao 1 estimator that measures the species in this case opfs richness based on the distribution of singletons and doubletons chao 1984 revealed that the richness of arhd genes in the mangrove sediment was higher than in all other sites except for site s9 amazonia table 2. indeed almost 82 of opfs determined in this study were represented by a single clone.the rarefaction curve expressed the observed number richness of opfs for each site as a function of the total sequences recovered from each site sanders 1968. the complete coverage of dataset isfigure 4 taxonomic a and functional c abundance of the total arhd gene sequences of all sites under study.

despite being the second most abundant function in general 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase was distributed only in sites s1 s4 s5 and s9 representing asia antarctica and south america figure 2. the sequences assigned to the naphthalene 12-dioxygenase were distributed in more than half of the analyzed sites representing theasia s1 south america s7 and s9 antarctica s3 s11 s12 and s15 and europe s6 and s13 figure 2. the sequences related to the un- defined arhd family were distributed in two sites in south america s7 and s9 while the sequences assigned to the ipb-dioxygenase were distributed in sites located in antarctica s4 and s5 and europe s6 figure 2. finally the sequences corresponding to the phenoxy- benzoate dioxygenase and catechol 23-dioxygenase were distributed only in one site in south america s9 and antarctica s15 respec- tively figure 2. the sites s4 s5 antarctica and s9 south america showed greater functional diversity figure 2.the majority of opfs in each site s4 s5 s9 s3 s7 s11 s12 s1 e sm were clustered closely together suggesting an overall levelfigure 3 phylogenetic tree representing the relationships among the opf representatives for arhd genes recovered from mangrove sediment and the most related hits from the genbank database.

description of arhd gene librarythe gene library assembled in this study yielded 129 high quality inserts for arhd genes approximately 329 bp in length from the 288 sequenced clones 44.8. the functional classification was con- firmed by blastx and revealed that all sequences were more closely related with the benzene 12-dioxygenase enzyme retrieved from pseudomonas figure 2. the average identity between the sequences was 77 with values ranging from 45 to 94. therefore the major- ity of opfs represent new types of arhd gene emphasizing their singularity and ecological importance to the mangrove.

some opfs of the sites s4 antarctica opfs 13 12 14 07 and 11 s5 antarctica opfs 13 11 06 and 18 and s9 amazonia opf 44 were recovered in a tight cluster except for opfs 44 and 13 and classified as undefined arhd family because of the low average percentage of identity 60 with their closest bacterial hits figure 4b.

in addition rarefaction curves were constructed to assess the observed richness d  0.05. the distribution of arhd opfs d  0.05 con- sidering the sequences from all sites and based on geographic origin was compared and displayed in a venn diagram fauth et al.

the diversity of arhd genes involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation pathway in the mangrove sediment was determined and compared to arhd gene sequences derived from other studies in an attempt to elucidate patterns of biogeographic distribution of such enzymes at a global scale.2  material and methods  samplingsediment samples were collected in a mangrove area affected by an oil spill in the 1980s located in the bertioga city sao paulo state 23o53'49'' s 46o12'28''w andreote et al.

curiously the opfs of the site s10 europe also showed evolutionary relatedness to the opfs of antarctica and south america sites figure 4b.of the five opfs identified among the eight sequences recov- ered from the s15 site antarctic soils only two were annotated as putative dioxygenases.

the results showed that the sampling effort performed in this study was sufficient to reveal all the opfs present in the samples from sites sm mangrove sediments1 china s2 northeast brazil s3 maritime antarctica and s9 amazonia figure 5. for the sites s4 s5 s6 s7 and s11 the curve clearly tends to an asymptote and additional sampling will probablyfigure 6 distribution of genera in each site based on the relative abundance of arhd sequences annotated against the ncbi refseq database by blastreveal only a few number of additional opfs.

phylogenetic analysis b of arhd sequences representing 166 opf among 1758 arhd sequences from 15 sites around the world.

the opfs 05 02 03 11 01 e 07 determined in this study were grouped with opfs of the sites s9 amazonia opfs 42 10 and 65 s2 northeast brazil opf 01 s4 botany point antarctica opf05 and s5 brazilian sta- tion antarctica opf05.

in contrast europe shared one opf with antarctica and four opfs with asia and south america shared six opfs with antarctica figure 7.figure 7 venn diagram of shared opfs among sites of different continental regions including asia site s1 north america site s8 south america sites s2 s7 and s9 europe sites s6 s10 ands13 and antarctica sites s3 s4 s5 s11 s12 and s15.

finally there were some opfs that clustered together according to their biogeo- chemical origins demonstrating ecological coherence opfs from sites s5 s4 s12 s15 and s11 and opfs from sites s13 and s6.

similarly a layer of the tree with eighteen opfs 52 average identity from the site s9 amazonia and other 52 average identity containing 4 2 and 1 opfs from the sites s9 amazonia s1 china and sm mangrove sediment respectively were classified as undefined arhd family and clustered sepa- rately from the other arhds figure 4b.

the diversity of genera inferred from the dioxygenase sequences found in the mangrove sediment was low although approximately half of the opfs found presented average identity lower than 80 with their closest bacterial hits.the venn diagram showed the shared opfs among sites of differ- ent continental regions.
