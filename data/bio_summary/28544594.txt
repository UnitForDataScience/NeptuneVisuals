Some OPFs of the sites S4 Antarctica OPFs 13 12 14 07 and 11 S5 Antarctica OPFs 13 11 06 and 18 and S9 Amazonia OPF 44 were recovered in a tight cluster except for OPFs 44 and 13 and classified as undefined ARHD family because of the low average percentage of identity 60 with their closest bacterial hits Figure 4b.

The distribution of ARHD OPFs D  0.05 con- sidering the sequences from all sites and based on geographic origin was compared and displayed in a Venn diagram Fauth et al.

The diversity of ARHD genes involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation pathway in the mangrove sediment was determined and compared to ARHD gene sequences derived from other studies in an attempt to elucidate patterns of biogeographic distribution of such enzymes at a global scale.2  MATERIAL AND METHODS  SamplingSediment samples were collected in a mangrove area affected by an oil spill in the 1980s located in the Bertioga city Sao Paulo State 23o53'49'' S 46o12'28''W Andreote et al.

Curiously the OPFs of the site S10 Europe also showed evolutionary relatedness to the OPFs of Antarctica and South America sites Figure 4b.Of the five OPFs identified among the eight sequences recov- ered from the S15 site Antarctic soils only two were annotated as putative dioxygenases.

Phylogenetic analysis b of ARHD sequences representing 166 OPF among 1758 ARHD sequences from 15 sites around the world.

The OPFs 05 02 03 11 01 e 07 determined in this study were grouped with OPFs of the sites S9 Amazonia OPFs 42 10 and 65 S2 Northeast Brazil OPF 01 S4 Botany Point Antarctica OPF05 and S5 Brazilian sta- tion Antarctica OPF05.

In contrast Europe shared one OPF with Antarctica and four OPFs with Asia and South America shared six OPFs with Antarctica Figure 7.FIGURE 7 Venn diagram of shared OPFs among sites of different continental regions including Asia site S1 North America site S8 South America sites S2 S7 and S9 Europe sites S6 S10 andS13 and Antarctica sites S3 S4 S5 S11 S12 and S15.

Finally there were some OPFs that clustered together according to their biogeo- chemical origins demonstrating ecological coherence OPFs from sites S5 S4 S12 S15 and S11 and OPFs from sites S13 and S6.

Similarly a layer of the tree with eighteen OPFs 52 average identity from the site S9 Amazonia and other 52 average identity containing 4 2 and 1 OPFs from the sites S9 Amazonia S1 China and SM Mangrove sediment respectively were classified as undefined ARHD family and clustered sepa- rately from the other ARHDs Figure 4b.
