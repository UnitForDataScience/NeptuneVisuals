A disturbed gut microbiota expressed as gut dysbiosis an intestinal physical barrier abnormality has been associated with the progression and maintenance of obesity type 2 dia- betes mellitus cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome - The mechanisms by which gut dysbio- sis produces and influences these metabolic alterations are via regulation of the host's energy balance and stor- age and by promoting endotoxaemia or bacteraemia Furthermore postprandial blood glucose levels are very much influenced by the gut bacteria with recent research demonstrating a profound influence on how individuals responded to identical food items that could be accurately predicted based on their gut bacterial profiles Gut dysbiosis may be restored to a bal- anced state through microbiota-based interventions which may improve metabolic markers associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory pathways.A probiotic is a microbiota-based intervention defined as 'a live microorganism which when administered in adequate amounts confers beneficial health effects on the host'  A meta-analysis evaluating the effect of probiotics on glycaemia suggests that probiotics can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus Certain probiotic species have improved insulin sensitivity inflammatory markers and lipid profiles in obese type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemic subjects -However it is not known whether a combination of probiotic species that have demonstrated beneficial therapeutic effects individually can improve metabolic markers associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and have an additive effect to standard care.

Participants are included in the study if they have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus by their gen- eral practitioner in the previous 12 months or have i a fasting plasma glucose level  7.0 mmoll or ii 2-hour post-challenge oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose level  11.1 mmoll or iii an HbA1c  6.5.Exclusion criteriaType 1 diabetes mellitusType 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed for longer than 12 monthsTaking anti-obesity drugs or blood glucose-lowering medications i.e.

All results will be sent to participants by email.Inclusion criteriaParticipants are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteriaAged  18 yearsBody mass index  25 kgmHave prediabetes or have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus within the previous 12 monthsAre treated by diet alone or diet plus metforminAre willing to adhere to the study protocol no yoghurt fermented food dietary supplements probiotics or prebiotics for the duration of the study.The definition of prediabetes is based on the American Diabetes Association guidelines  and participants must have i a fasting plasma glucose level between5.6 mmoll and 6.9 mmoll or ii two-hour post-challenge oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose level betweenmmoll and 11 mmoll or iii HbA1c between 5.7 and 6.4.The criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is based on the American Diabetes Association guidelines .

In designing this clinicalstudy several key decisions were made to overcome current limitations in the published literature and reduce possible biases.While focusing on those with prediabetes subjects with early type 2 diabetes mellitus were included to assess the feasibility of inducing partial or complete remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

This decision also meant including participants taking metformin as this drug is commonly prescribed early in type 2 diabetes mellitus it has also been shown to have effects on the microbiome Fur- thermore microbiota-based interventions may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with metformin administration with a consequent improvement in medication compliance As far as we are aware the interaction between the gastrointestinal microbiota probiotics and metformin has not been explored in pa- tients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Therefore the aim is to test the safety and efficacy of this novel probiotic formulation in adults with prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Sixty adults with prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes mellitus will be randomized to take either a multi-species probiotic capsule or placebo for 12 weeks.

Participants who do not have type 2 diabetes mellitus will undergo a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test to assess glucose and insulin levels at three time points 0 min 60 min and 120 min.

The fact that the study includes two differ- ent cohorts participants with prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes mellitus was also taken into consideration as owing to the lack of stratification at randomization the variance could be high.
