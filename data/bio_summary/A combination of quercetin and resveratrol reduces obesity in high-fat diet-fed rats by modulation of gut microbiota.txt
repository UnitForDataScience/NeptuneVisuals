After a one-week adaptation period rats were randomly divided into 2 groups as follows a normal diet group ND n  8 10 kcal fat consisted of 5.4 from soybean oil and 4.6 from lard 20 proteins 70 carbohydrates and a high fat diet group HFD n  24 45 kcal fat consisted of 5.6 from soybean oil and 39.4 from lard 20 proteins 35 carbo- hydrates as described elsewhere ESI Tables S1 and S2.17 The rats with body weights in the lower thirds were screened out as obesity-resistant rats after 2 weeks on HFD.19 The rest of the 16 rats were randomly divided into 2 sub-groups the CQR group n  8 and the HFD group n  8.

Lactobacillales an order of Gram-positive bacteria that comprise lactic acid bacteria were significantly decreased in the HFD group compared to the other two groups P  0.001 and HFD feeding might inhibit the amount of fecal Lactobacillales.4950 Previous studies reported that the family Desulfovibrionaceae is potentially an important group of endotoxin producers.51 The present model of HFD-induced inflammation was explained largely by dysbio- sis of gut microbiota and elevated concentration of lipopoly- saccharides LPS in plasma a condition called metabolic endotoxemia.52 LPS produced by the bacteria of the family Desulfovibrionaceae has potent inflammation-inducing capacity.53 Here a lower abundance of the family Desulfo- vibrionaceae was discovered in the CQR group than in the HFD group which may help in alleviating inflammation.

In this study Wistar rats were divided into three groups a normal diet ND group a HFD group and a CQR group.

In short Wistar rats were divided into three groups a ND group a HFD group and a CQR group after two weeks.

At the OTU level the community richness measured by the Shannon index decreased significantly in the HFD group compared with the CQR group and the ND group Fig.

Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in all samples accounting for 65 in the ND group 85 in the HFD group and 70 in the CQR group of the total bacterial sequences Fig.

The ratio of FirmicutesBacteroidetes was elevated in the HFD group which is consistent with many former studies4344 and it was lower in the CQR group 14.63 than the HFD group 23.78 with the difference close to significance P  0.052.

Red colors indicate high values whereas green colors mean low values for the percent of reads classified at that rank.relative abundances of Bacteroidetes in the HFD group P  0.001 and the CQR group P  0.01 are significantly different from the ND group.

The family Coriobacteriaceae belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria can be seen as paradigm pathobionts55 and the members of the family Coriobacteriaceae are involved in bile acid metabolism which is linked to gut barrier and metabolic dysfunctions5156 and have a negative effect on cholesterol homeostasis through increasing cholesterol absorption.57 Moreover the abundance of the Coriobacteriaceae bacterial group was positively corre- lated with TG levels or non-HDL cholesterol levels.5657 With the consumption of CQR the Coriobacteriaceae level wasdecreased P  0.05 and this may relate to the decrease of TG and TC in the CQR group.

These results suggested that CQR could inhibit diet-induced obesity.The effects of CQR on serum biochemical parametersCompared to the ND group values the serum TC P  0.01 TG P  0.05 and LDL-C P  0.01 levels were significantly elev- ated in the HFD group.
