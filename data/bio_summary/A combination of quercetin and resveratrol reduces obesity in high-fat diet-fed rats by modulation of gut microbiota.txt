Lactobacillales an order of Gram-positive bacteria that comprise lactic acid bacteria were significantly decreased in the HFD group compared to the other two groups P  0.001 and HFD feeding might inhibit the amount of fecal Lactobacillales.4950 Previous studies reported that the family Desulfovibrionaceae is potentially an important group of endotoxin producers.51 The present model of HFD-induced inflammation was explained largely by dysbio- sis of gut microbiota and elevated concentration of lipopoly- saccharides LPS in plasma a condition called metabolic endotoxemia.52 LPS produced by the bacteria of the family Desulfovibrionaceae has potent inflammation-inducing capacity.53 Here a lower abundance of the family Desulfo- vibrionaceae was discovered in the CQR group than in the HFD group which may help in alleviating inflammation.

However rats may show different responses to the same HFD in the following ways depending on their unique genotype some of them may develop obesity-prone OP phenotypes and others showed obesity-resistant OR pheno- types.19 Therefore the Wistar rats with weight gain in the lower thirds were screened out as obesity-resistant rats in our study.35 The studies on the adult rats' gastrointestinal tract microbiota indicated that the abundance of the rats' intestinal bacterial species is of the same order of magnitude as or evenhigher than the human gut microbiota.36 The same 4 predomi- nant bacterial phyla described in humans Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were detected in rat fecal contents3738 suggesting that a rat is a good model to research the influence of diet on gut microbiota.

6.DiscussionIn the previous study we indicated that the combined sup- plementation with Q 4 g kg-1 diet and R 4 g kg-1 diet pro- duced synergistic effects on suppressing the HFD-induced body weight gain and inflammation in mice.14 It is reported that gut microbiota plays a great role in the development of HFD-induced obesity.25-27 The anti-obesity effects of Q and R may be partly mediated by regulating the composition of gut microbes.2829 We therefore speculated that CQR's effects on the development of obesity might depend on gut microbiota.

Altogether these findings in accordance with the previous reports that gut microbiota dys-biosis is induced by HFD might contribute to concluding that the effects of CQR on obesity might depend on its modulation effect on gut microbiota.ConclusionsIn summary the present study demonstrated that the intake of CQR could reduce the body weight gain visceral adipose tissue weight serum lipids and inflammation associated with HFD-induced obesity.

Collectively these results showed that CQR modulated the gut microbiota of the HFD fed rats.To further identify the faecal microbiota community changed in the obese rat model 50 genera with the relative abundance were presented by a heat map.

The microbiota in the intestine of an obese animal or human is accompanied by the increasing Firmicutes level.39-41 Moreover the increasing abundance of Firmicutes in the gut microbiota of obese patients could increase the capacity ofharvesting energy from the diet thus promoting more efficientabsorption of calories and subsequent weight gain.42 This might be the reason that there was no significant difference of food intake among three groups while the weight gain P  0.01 of the HFD group was higher than the CQR group.
