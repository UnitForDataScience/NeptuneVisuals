the raw read counts from the 16s otu abundance table were collapsed at taxonomic rank and composi- tionally normalized such that each sample sums to 1.the relative sequence abundance referred to as rela- tive abundance from this point forward in the text of the bacterial populations at the respective taxonomic rank were analyzed using the mixed procedure of sas with repeated measures version 9.3 sas institute inc. cary nc as described by rico et al.

the mfd d 10 was typified by a reduction in the relative sequence abundance of bacteroidetes and an increase in the relative sequence abundance of firmicutes and actinobacteria across both fractions.
