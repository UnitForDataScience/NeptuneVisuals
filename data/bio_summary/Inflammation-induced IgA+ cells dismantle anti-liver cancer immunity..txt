HFD feeding of WT and MUP-uPA mice caused weight gain and mild liver damage but methionine and choline deficient diet MCD-fed mice exhibited severe weight loss and extensive liver damage and STAM mice did not gain weight .Class switch recombination to IgA is stimulated by TGFb1 lipopoly- saccharide interleukin-33 IL-33 IL-21 CD40 and lymphotoxin.

Unlike CDD-HFD mice in which CD8 T cells promote non-fibrotic liver damage CD8 T cells do not contribute to NASH in MUP-uPA mice which are highly fibrotic and depend on macrophage TNF production.IgA cell and CTL interplay in HCC developmentAfter 7 months of HFD MUP-uPA mice developed HCC which contained numerous usually 50-100 per tumour non-recurrent coding mutations in pathways that are mutated in human HCC and .
