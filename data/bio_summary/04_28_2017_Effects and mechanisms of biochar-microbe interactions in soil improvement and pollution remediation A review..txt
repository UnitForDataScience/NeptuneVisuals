Since the mechanisms underlying biochar's effects on mi- crobes and related soil functions and processes are still not quite clear this review focuses on the synthesis of several possible mechanisms based on the published research.The influences of biochar on microbial activity are diverse and seven possible mechanisms are demonstrated in the central circle of from which points 1 to 3 can be classified into direct in- fluences and points 4 to 7 indirect influences 1 biochar provides shelter for soil microbes with pore structures and surfaces  2 biochar supplies nutrients to soil mi- crobes for their growth with those nutrients and ions adsorbed on biochar particles  3 biochar triggers potential toxicity with VOCs and environmentally persistent free radicals  4 biochar modifies microbial habitats by improving soil properties that are essential for microbial growth including aeration conditions water content and pH   5 biochar induces changes in enzyme activities that affect soil elemental cycles related to microbes   6 biochar interrupts microbial intra- and inter-specific communication between microbial cells via a com- bination of sorption and the hydrolysis of signaling molecules   it should be noted that biochar may contain some molecules that can work as signals for microbial communication and 7 biochar enhances the sorption and degradation of soil contaminants and reduces their bioavailability and toxicity to microbes  .

The model also indicates that biochar can reduce the mineralization rate constant of native SOC and increase its MRT especially in acidic soil .Mechanisms of biochar-enhanced soil carbon sequestrationThe factors involved in the maintenance of soil carbon stability with biochar application  include 1 the recalcitrant nature of biochars due to their aromatic carbon structure and the crystal silicon structure in silica-carbon complexes formed during pyrol- ysis  2 the interaction between surface oxygenated functional groups such as carboxyl with soil minerals are favorable to maintaining the carbon stability of biochar during the aging process   3 the adsorption of soil organic matter that is beneficial for soil aggregate formation  4 the availabilityFig.

Therefore this review aims to seek answers for the following questions 1 What are the most essential physiochemical properties of biochar that influence the microbial activity and community and how do these properties influence the microbes 2 Mechanistically how does the inter- action of the soil microbes with different types of biochar affect soil carbon sequestration and contaminant dissipation Answers to these questions are essential to identifying the cause of the het- erogeneous effects of biochar in existing research and to develop the required understanding to accurately predict biochar effects both of which are key challenges in this research field.Driving mechanisms of biochar-microbe interaction in soilBiochar affects the soil microbial activity and biomass changes the soil bacteria to fungi ratio and soil enzyme activity and re- shapes the microbial community structure  .

Proposed carbon sequestration mechanisms affected by biochar including A the stable carbon structure of biochar aromatic carbon structure and crystal silicon structure in silica-carbon complexes  B the reaction of biochar with soil minerals which forms a complex structure that protects biochar from microbial degradation  C biochar adsorption of soil organic matter SOM forming aggregates that protect the degra- dation of SOM  D protection of soil aggregates by fungal hyphae and the secreted glomalin  E modification of soil enzyme activities that control soil organic carbon decomposition .

These processes can reduce the CO2 emission from the decomposition of biochar and SOM.of soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that are able to secrete glo- malin the protein that promotes soil microaggregation due to its impact on hydration  and 5 the influences on the soil microbial community and the modification of soil enzyme activities that control soil organic carbon decomposition  .

The electron transfer between biochar particles and soil minerals organic matter pollutant mol- ecules and microbial cells as well as in response of the microbial community to the reactive components of the biochar is an emerging research field that seeks to further clarify the effects of biochar on soil biogeochemical processes.Several studies in the past decade extensively discussed the structure physiochemical properties and structure-function re- lationships of biochar with respect to the apparent effects of bio- char on soil   however an understanding of biochar- microbe interactions is a research gap that would link biochar properties with many soil processes e.g.

pH water content and aeration conditions and change the growth pattern of soil microbes 5 biochar can adsorb enzyme molecules influence soil enzyme activities and elemental cycles 6 biochar can adsorb and enhance the hydrolysis of signaling mol- ecules and consequently interrupt microbial communication and alter microbial community structure 7 biochar can enhance the sorption via biochar surface functional groups and degradation of soil contaminants facilitated through electron transfer between biochar microbes and contaminants which can reduce the toxicity of contaminants to soil microbes.

Schematic diagram showing the roles of biochar functional groups AFG 14 acidic functional groups SOM 14 soil organic matter 1 The AFG are responsible for the liming effect of biochar which modifies the soil microbial habitat 2 the electrostatic attraction between the carboxyl groups of biochar with the nutrient cations effectively retains nutrients to ensure a nutrient supply to soil microbes and 3 to immobilize heavy metals thus reducing heavy metal toxicity to microbial cells 4 electrostatic attraction as well as polar and non-polar organic attraction of humic acid molecules can result in the adsorption of soil organic matter that is beneficial for carbon sequestration further discussed in later chapter 5 hydrogen bonding between eOH groups on biochar with oxygenated anions can adsorb inorganic anions to supply nutrients or reduce anion contaminant toxicity 6 electron transfer to form free radicals on the biochar surface can facilitate organic contaminant degradation and heavy metal transformation to be detailed discussed in later chapter and can reduce contaminant toxicity to microbes.Table S1  .

Biochar porosity can decrease soil bulk density improve soil aeration condition  and control the transport of soil microbes in biochar amended soil  .

Soil enzymatic activities respond faster than other soil variables to soil management and disturbance introduced into soil and are therefore indicators of biological changes and soil quality .
