since the mechanisms underlying biochar's effects on mi- crobes and related soil functions and processes are still not quite clear this review focuses on the synthesis of several possible mechanisms based on the published research.the influences of biochar on microbial activity are diverse and seven possible mechanisms are demonstrated in the central circle of from which points 1 to 3 can be classified into direct in- fluences and points 4 to 7 indirect influences 1 biochar provides shelter for soil microbes with pore structures and surfaces  2 biochar supplies nutrients to soil mi- crobes for their growth with those nutrients and ions adsorbed on biochar particles  3 biochar triggers potential toxicity with vocs and environmentally persistent free radicals  4 biochar modifies microbial habitats by improving soil properties that are essential for microbial growth including aeration conditions water content and ph   5 biochar induces changes in enzyme activities that affect soil elemental cycles related to microbes   6 biochar interrupts microbial intra- and inter-specific communication between microbial cells via a com- bination of sorption and the hydrolysis of signaling molecules   it should be noted that biochar may contain some molecules that can work as signals for microbial communication and 7 biochar enhances the sorption and degradation of soil contaminants and reduces their bioavailability and toxicity to microbes  .

the model also indicates that biochar can reduce the mineralization rate constant of native soc and increase its mrt especially in acidic soil .mechanisms of biochar-enhanced soil carbon sequestrationthe factors involved in the maintenance of soil carbon stability with biochar application  include 1 the recalcitrant nature of biochars due to their aromatic carbon structure and the crystal silicon structure in silica-carbon complexes formed during pyrol- ysis  2 the interaction between surface oxygenated functional groups such as carboxyl with soil minerals are favorable to maintaining the carbon stability of biochar during the aging process   3 the adsorption of soil organic matter that is beneficial for soil aggregate formation  4 the availabilityfig.

therefore this review aims to seek answers for the following questions 1 what are the most essential physiochemical properties of biochar that influence the microbial activity and community and how do these properties influence the microbes 2 mechanistically how does the inter- action of the soil microbes with different types of biochar affect soil carbon sequestration and contaminant dissipation answers to these questions are essential to identifying the cause of the het- erogeneous effects of biochar in existing research and to develop the required understanding to accurately predict biochar effects both of which are key challenges in this research field.driving mechanisms of biochar-microbe interaction in soilbiochar affects the soil microbial activity and biomass changes the soil bacteria to fungi ratio and soil enzyme activity and re- shapes the microbial community structure  .

soil enzymatic activities respond faster than other soil variables to soil management and disturbance introduced into soil and are therefore indicators of biological changes and soil quality .

these processes can reduce the co2 emission from the decomposition of biochar and som.of soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that are able to secrete glo- malin the protein that promotes soil microaggregation due to its impact on hydration  and 5 the influences on the soil microbial community and the modification of soil enzyme activities that control soil organic carbon decomposition  .

the electron transfer between biochar particles and soil minerals organic matter pollutant mol- ecules and microbial cells as well as in response of the microbial community to the reactive components of the biochar is an emerging research field that seeks to further clarify the effects of biochar on soil biogeochemical processes.several studies in the past decade extensively discussed the structure physiochemical properties and structure-function re- lationships of biochar with respect to the apparent effects of bio- char on soil   however an understanding of biochar- microbe interactions is a research gap that would link biochar properties with many soil processes e.g.

ph water content and aeration conditions and change the growth pattern of soil microbes 5 biochar can adsorb enzyme molecules influence soil enzyme activities and elemental cycles 6 biochar can adsorb and enhance the hydrolysis of signaling mol- ecules and consequently interrupt microbial communication and alter microbial community structure 7 biochar can enhance the sorption via biochar surface functional groups and degradation of soil contaminants facilitated through electron transfer between biochar microbes and contaminants which can reduce the toxicity of contaminants to soil microbes.

biochar porosity can decrease soil bulk density improve soil aeration condition  and control the transport of soil microbes in biochar amended soil  .

to better reveal the mechanisms the identification and quantification of reactive compounds from biochar which are able to interfere with microbial communication is an important research field.biochar reduces the toxicity of contaminants to soil microbesbiochar as a soil ameliorant can decrease the toxicity of soil contaminants to soil microbes .

in addition to the effect of reducing the toxicity of contaminants to soil microbes thus enhancing microbial activity interactions between the biochar and soil microbes have more profound effects on the environmental fate of soil contaminants including their immobilization and degradation which are to be discussed in a later chapter of this review.soil carbon storage under biochar-microbe interactionbiochar can enhance soil carbon sequestration by various mechanisms.

as a conse- quence biochar is considerably involved in the preservation of the soil humus including humic acids has fulvic acids fas and humins hms in soil which can be ascribed to the presence of abundant oxygenated functional groups that favor soil aggregation formation via sorption .to evaluate the effects of biochar application on the soil carbon sequestration and the deposition of native soc it is crucial to distinguish between the microbial decomposition of organiccarbon from biochar and that from native soc.

similarly fungal abundance was found to be reduced with the decreasing size of soil aggregation due to the c substrates being less available in soil fractions with aggregates smaller than 200 mm .the effects of biochar amendment on soil microaggregation are not only related to the direct adsorption of soil organic matter on biochar surfaces but also to the alteration of the microbial com- munity especially fungi that produces proteins such as glomalin hydrophobins and chaplins that positively influence micro- aggregate formation and stability .
