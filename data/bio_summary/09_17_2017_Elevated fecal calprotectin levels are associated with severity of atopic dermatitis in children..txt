up to two-thirds of infants with moderate-to-severe ad show sensitization to food allergens in the first 2 years of life however only a minor proportion of sensitized infants have concomitant ige-mediated food allergy.18 thus we excluded subjects aged less than 3 years to eliminate the possible effects of food allergy.increased levels of fecal calprotectin have been reported in children with inflammatory bowel disease or food aller- gy.101920 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease the fecal calprotectin level closely related with mucosal gastrointestinal inflammation.16 fecal calprotectin levels were elevated and used to monitor mucosal healing in patients with ulcerative colitis as well.19 thus fecal calprotectin has been considered a sensitive marker of mucosal healing in gut inflammation.

fecal calprotectin has been suggested to be as a simple and reproducible marker to evaluate the inflammatory status of the gastrointestinal tract and to monitor infants with cow's milk protein allergy.16-17in the present study a reference calprotectin value of a 50 mgg in feces is used as a cut-off level according to the study by fagerberg et al.15 fecal calprotectin concentrations seem to be age-dependent in infancy however healthy children aged between 4-17 years apparently exhibit constant fecal calprotectin excretions similar to those of adults.15 ad is one of the most common clinical manifestations of food allergy and may not be completely excluded from this study.

fecal calprotectin has been used for a non-invasive marker of gut inflammation.objective the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between fecal calprotectin level and the clinical severity of atopic dermatitis ad in children.methods we enrolled 65 subjects with ad.

the concentration of calprotectin was measured in each subject's fecal sample.results the geometric mean fecal calprotectin level of the total subjects was 33.110.1-108.9 mgg.

the fecal calprotectin level significantly correlated with the scorad indexr0.303 p0.014.conclusions higher fecal calprotectin levels were observed in subjects with severe ad.

elevated concentrations of calprotectin can be measured in plasma urine and feces when there is ongoing inflammation.910 increased calprotectin levels have been found in chronic inflammatory bowel disease or allergic diseases.10-12 fecal calprotectin is a potentially important clinical test as a marker of gastrointestinal tract inflammation and has been increasingly used as a non-invasive marker for the diagnosis of bowel inflammation or gastrointestinal allergic diseases.101113although many studies have reported the relationship between fecal calprotectin and gastrointestinal inflammation or allergic diseases calprotectin has rarely been studied in ad.

positive sensitization rates to food allergens were not different between the 2 groups 34.1 vs 38.1 p0.787 table 1. the geometric means range of 1sd of fecal calprotectin levels were not different between the positive- and negative food specific-ige groups 36.6 11.7-114.4 mgg vs 31.5 9.21-107.8 mgg p0.625.table 1. characteristics of the subjects with atopic dermatitistable 2. scorad indices and fecal calprotectin levels in subjects with atopic dermatitisdata are expressed as mean - sd or geometric mean range of 1 sd.

in addition high fecal calprotectin levels were found in children with egg allergy.20 the fecal calprotectin levels were almost twice higher in children with challenge-proved food allergy than in those with negative challenge results.20 thus it could be useful for the diagnosis of a certain allergic diseases.

however only a few studies have addressed elevated calprotectin levels in the skin or serum in ad.1221 orivuori et al.22 demonstrated that infants with high fecal calprotectin levels at the age of 2 months had an increased risk of developing ad by age 6. they concluded that imbalance of the gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation in early life was associated with later development of ad.the gut immune system is an important regulator of immune-mediated diseases such as allergies.4 numerous investigators have shown that changes in the gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation have been associated with the development of allergic diseases.681323 the gut microbiota controls intestinal inflammation which further modulates the development of the systemic immune system.823 altered gut microbiota induces epithelial damage resulting in increased intestinal inflammation altered gut permeability and immunological balance which affect the development of allergic diseases.81323 the damaged epithelium with increased permeability might allow for the passage of allergens.24 prolonged enhanced permeability and increased exposure to allergens might result in the subsequent development of atopic eczema.624 several studies have revealed that infantsfecal calprotectin in atopic dermatitiswith eczema exhibit alterations in the relative levels of beneficial and potentially harmful bacteria compared to healthy infants.56 although specific molecules produced by commensal bacteria that trigger inflammatory responses in the gut are still not well-characterized numerous microbiota-associated molecules including short chain fatty acid scfa are known to regulate inflammatory responses through the induction of immune cells.25 altered gut microbiota and subsequently reduced production in scfa can be implicated in children with ad.8 the gut microbiota appears to play an important role in controlling not only gut specific but also distant immune responses.it is likely that elevated fecal calprotectin plays a patho- physiological role in the inflammatory process in gut.

results of decreased fecal calprotectin after administration of probiotics for 4 weeks support that probiotics or live microorganisms may affect the host by supplying beneficial intestinal bacteria and provide health benefits.26 interestingly infants with low fecal calprotectin levels shows a low lactobacillaceae abundance and a high percentage of escherichia in feces which suggests early colonization of the gut microbiota regulate intestinal inflammation.

however whether fecal calprotectin directly contributes to the pathogenetic mechanisms in children with ad remains to be explored.meanwhile previous studies have demonstrated that exclu- sively breastfed infants have higher fecal calprotectin levels.2227 this could be explained by higher microbial exposure via breast milk.

in the present study the incidence of exposure to ets was significantly higher in subjects with high fecal calprotectin levels compared to those with low fecal calprotectin levels.
