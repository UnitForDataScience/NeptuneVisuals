Isolating the effects of dispersal limitation on the compositional diversification of mam- malian gut microbiotas would be better accomplished by compar- ing the microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric populations of host species that experience little or no dietary overlap in sympatry.To quantify the degree to which bacterial dispersal limitation has accelerated the diversification of the gut microbiotas of mam- malian species we surveyed the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric populations of carnivore artiodactyl and rodent species residing in the wild throughout the Americas focusing on mammalian assemblages in western North America.

Sign tests across comparisons indicated that the microbiotas of large-bodied predators were significantly more similar to the microbiotas of large-bodied prey than were the microbiotas of small-bodied predators six of six comparisons P  0.0156 and that the microbiotas of small-bodied predators were significantly more similar to the microbiotas of small-bodied prey than were the microbiotas of large-bodied predators eight of eight comparisons P  0.0039.

Similarly the gut microbiotas of Puma Lynx Canis lupus and Canis latrans were each more compositionally similar to the gut microbiotas of their preferred prey species than were the gut microbiotas of Ursus0.99960.99950.99940.99930.99920.99910.9990.99890.99880.99870.99960.99940.99920.9990.99880.99860.99840.99820.99960.99940.99920.9990.99880.99860.99840.99820.9990.99850.9980.99750.9970.99650.9960.99550.9950.950.9450.940.9350.930.9250.920.920.910.90.890.880.870.860.850.840.9450.940.93510.9950.990.9850.980.9750.9710.99950.9990.99850.9980.99750.9970.99650.9960.99550.99950.9990.99850.9980.99750.9970.99650.9960.9980.99750.9970.99650.9960.99550.9950.9460.9440.9420.940.9380.9360.9340.9320.930.890.8850.880.8750.870.8650.860.930.925nsPeromyscus maniculatusTamias minimusSciurus nigerPerognathus parvusCervus elaphusAlces alcesprey relationship harbored microbiotas that were composition- ally more similar to one another than to the microbiotas of other individuals belonging to their respective taxonomic orders Fig.

Dispersal limitation has been previously shown to promote b-diversity between the gut microbiotas of indi- viduals of the same host species 18 19 42 43 our results indicate that dispersal limitation also contributes to b-diversity between gut microbiotas of populations of different host species.We also observed that the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of mammalian species decayed exponentially with the evolutionary time separating the host species indepen- dently of geographic distance.

Predator-prey interac- tions were associated with increased overlap between the gut microbiotas of host species The microbiotas of prey species were always more similar to those of their primary predator speciesthan to those of other Carnivora species Fig.

In contrast the gut microbiotas of cohabiting humans and dogs do not appear to share significantly more phylotypes than do the gut microbiotas of humans and dogs living separately although the skin microbiotas of dog owners do appear to contain phylotypes derived from the gut microbiotas of their dogs 20.

Comparing the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric mammalian populations provided insights into the flow of gut bacteria within and between mammalian communities revealing that spatial limits on bacterial dispersal promote b-diversity between the gut microbiotas of mam- malian species.

Together these results indicate that the probability of bacterial proliferation between the gut microbiotas of co-occurring host species may depend on the phylogenetic divergence between the hosts.We observed that the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of allopatric mammalian populations decayed expo- nentially with the geographic distance separating the hosts across the western hemisphere independently of host phylogenetic di- vergence Fig.

However the degree to which the diversification of gut-microbiota compositions across mammalian species has been influenced by spatial limits on bacterial dispersalhas been less widely explored.If mammalian gut bacteria are dispersal limited then increasing the physical distance between host species should attenuate bac- terial transmission and increase b-diversity between the hosts' gut microbiotas.

mass effects 16 17.Several studies have shown that limitations on bacterial dis- persal can generate differences between the gut microbiotas of individuals within mammalian species 18 19 but few have ex- plored whether dispersal limitation promotes differences in gut- microbiota composition among mammalian species.
