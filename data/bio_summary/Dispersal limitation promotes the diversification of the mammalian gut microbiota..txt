pre- vious work has shown that sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas share on average 53 more bacterial phylotypes than do allopatric hosts 14 and a survey of two sympatric species of peromyscus revealed no consistent compositional differences between their gut micro- biotas 34. in contrast the gut microbiotas of cohabiting humans and dogs do not appear to share significantly more phylotypes than do the gut microbiotas of humans and dogs living separately although the skin microbiotas of dog owners do appear to contain phylotypes derived from the gut microbiotas of their dogs 20. together these results indicate that the probability of bacterial proliferation between the gut microbiotas of co-occurring host species may depend on the phylogenetic divergence between the hosts.we observed that the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of allopatric mammalian populations decayed expo- nentially with the geographic distance separating the hosts across the western hemisphere independently of host phylogenetic di- vergence fig.

isolating the effects of dispersal limitation on the compositional diversification of mam- malian gut microbiotas would be better accomplished by compar- ing the microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric populations of host species that experience little or no dietary overlap in sympatry.to quantify the degree to which bacterial dispersal limitation has accelerated the diversification of the gut microbiotas of mam- malian species we surveyed the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric populations of carnivore artiodactyl and rodent species residing in the wild throughout the americas focusing on mammalian assemblages in western north america.

dispersal limitation has been previously shown to promote b-diversity between the gut microbiotas of indi- viduals of the same host species 18 19 42 43 our results indicate that dispersal limitation also contributes to b-diversity between gut microbiotas of populations of different host species.we also observed that the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of mammalian species decayed exponentially with the evolutionary time separating the host species indepen- dently of geographic distance.

predator-prey interac- tions were associated with increased overlap between the gut microbiotas of host species the microbiotas of prey species were always more similar to those of their primary predator speciesthan to those of other carnivora species fig.

habitat filtering drift and in situ diversification 2. comparisons across the mammalian phylogeny have revealed that differences in selective pressures between the gut environments of mammalian species have promoted the diversification of gut- microbiota compositions each mammalian species maintains a compositionally distinct gut microbiota that reflects host diet physiology and genetics 3-15. however the degree to which the diversification of gut-microbiota compositions across mammalian species has been influenced by spatial limits on bacterial dispersalhas been less widely explored.if mammalian gut bacteria are dispersal limited then increasing the physical distance between host species should attenuate bac- terial transmission and increase b-diversity between the hosts' gut microbiotas.

determinations of the primary prey species for each carnivore species were based on field observations of predator behavior in washington state 55. in these analyses we included the gut microbiotas of all prey pop- ulations in our dataset whose species ranges overlap with the sampling region in northeast washington state even if the specific populations of prey sampled were located outside this region.acknowledgments.

comparing the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric mammalian populations provided insights into the flow of gut bacteria within and between mammalian communities revealing that spatial limits on bacterial dispersal promote b-diversity between the gut microbiotas of mam- malian species.

mass effects 16 17.several studies have shown that limitations on bacterial dis- persal can generate differences between the gut microbiotas of individuals within mammalian species 18 19 but few have ex- plored whether dispersal limitation promotes differences in gut- microbiota composition among mammalian species.

most interspecific comparisons of mammalian gut microbiotas have focused on host species living in isolation from one another either in captivity 2 3 19 or in the wild 4-14 and little attention has been paid to how spatial relationships among host species influence patterns of gut-microbiota b-diversity.

however because sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas inhabit overlapping ecological niches and consume many of the same food resources it is not clear whether the compositional similarity of the gut microbiotas of sympatric hosts was due to increased bac- terial dispersal between these species or to shared selective pressures in the gut environments of the host species.

distance-decay of community similarity 39 can arise from the decreasing probability of dis- persal with distance 40 as well as from ecological gradients in which more proximate habitat patches select for more similarsets of species 41. that the overlap between the gut microbiotas of mammalian species decayed with the geographic distance be- tween hosts independently of host phylogenetic divergence which is associated with the divergence of selective pressures within the gut e.g.

host- derived dna was extracted from samples as described previously and species of origin was confirmed by mtdna d-loop sequencing 46 47. variation in measurements of gut-microbiota composition due to differences in the sam- ple collection procedures used in this study is expected to be low relative to the biological variation among the microbiotas of host species 48 49. total dna from fecal material was extracted via a bead-beating procedure and pcr amplifications of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene were conducted using the universal 515f806r primer pair as described previously 50. amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq at the microbial analysis resources and services mars facility at the university of connecticut.

sympatric populations of different host taxa should harbor gut microbiotas that are more compositionally similar to one another than are the microbiotas of geographicallyseparated i.e.
