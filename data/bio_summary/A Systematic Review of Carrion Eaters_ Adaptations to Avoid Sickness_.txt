we acknowledge that very few studies directly and formally evaluated these hypotheses in scav- engers and that a recent study of food washing in a nonscavenger found that washing food reduced infection sarabian and macintosh 2015. we also acknowledge that some conclusions are pathogen specific.

with the exception of food washing none of these hypotheses have been properly evaluated as an adaptation to avoid sickness from carrion.

there is some support for having a specialized micro- biome having enhanced immunologic defenses avoiding rotten food and maintaining a low gastric ph to eliminate pathogens.

we found no studies thatshort communications579formally tested whether urine or uric acid kills carrion-acquired pathogens.avoiding rotten foodhouston 1986 observed that turkey vul- tures avoided rotten food by recording the time it took for scavengers to find carcasses and the proportion of the carcass eaten.

turkey vultures primarily relied on their acute olfactory senses to locate food stager 1964 thus some decomposition assists location but when given a choice vultures prefer 1-d-old carcasses over 5-d-old carcasses houston 1986. in contrast brown tree snakes boiga irregularis are more likely to eat a 2-d-old carcass over a 1-d-old carcass jojola-elverum et al.

2001 hypothesized that brown tree snakes either actively seek rotten food or they are unable to find carrion that has not rotted.
