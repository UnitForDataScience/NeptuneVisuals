pathophysiological significance emerges i when ab-specific plasma cells settle in the brain and produce large amounts of brain antigen-directed ab intrathecally andor ii in conditions of compromised blood-brain barrier bbb for instance upon injury infection inflammation or genetic predisposition apoe4 haplotype which then allows substantial access of circulating ab to the brain.

in any case of suspected symptomatic consequences of circulating ab directed against brain antigens leakiness of the bbb should be evaluated by csf analysis albumin quotient as proxy and mag- netic resonance imaging before considering immunosuppression.keywords blood-brain barrier dysfunction immunoglobulin class serum cerebrospinal fluid inflammation functionality assays neuropsychiatric diseases healthy subjectsthis viewpoint review is arranged around two tabulated figures one summarizing nmdar1 autoantibody ab findings and integrating them into an explanatory model  and the other trying to give clear recommendations for the clinical decision process on immunosuppressive treatment based on the present state of knowledge .please note that the new nomenclature glun1 for nmdar1 nr1 is disregarded here for consistency with most of the respec- tive reviewed literature.nmda receptors in brain and peripheryn-methyl-d-aspartate receptors nmdar are glutamate-gated ion channels abundantly expressed in mammalian brain .

another attractive idea that has not yet been pursued in the nmdar1-ab field is the potential modulatory influence of the microbiome on boosting of nmdar1-ab .other brain antigen-directed abwhy do we see nmdar1-ab so abundantly in health and disease does this also hold true for other ab directed against brain antigens to address these questions we analogously studied 24 other brain antigen-directed serum ab previously connected with pathological conditions.

under conditions of brain inflammation intrathecal production and class switch to igg may provoke high nmdar1-ab and other brain antigen-directed ab levels in cerebrospinal fluid csf and serum causing the severe syndrome named anti-nmdar encephalitis which then requires immunosuppressive therapy on top of the causal encephalitis treatment if available.

translational experiments in mice proved the hypothesis that the brain acts as immunoprecipitator simultaneous injection of nmdar1-ab igg and a non-brain-binding non- sense-ab anti-gfp igg resulted in high detectability of the former only in the brain distinctly more pronounced upon bbb dysfunction and the latter only in csf .

to sum up brain antigen-directed ab in general and nmdar1-ab in particular seem to be part of a preexisting autoimmune repertoire  - that gains pathophysi- ological significance in conditions of intrathecal synthesis or compromised bbb for instance upon injury infection brain inflammation or genetic predisposition to bbb leakiness apoe4 haplotype.conclusions and recommendationsall naturally occurring serum nmdar1-ab obviously have pathogenic potential.

moreover brain inflammation likely plays a crucial role in determining syndrome acuteness and severity as contributed by circulating nmdar1-ab and even more pronounced by respec- tive plasma cells that reside in or potentially migrate to the brain in inflammatory conditions to produce ab intrathecally .

brain antigen-directed ab in general and nmdar1-ab in particular belong to a preexisting autoimmune repertoire of mammals including humans.

regarding nmdar1-ab func- tional effects on neurons in vitro and elicitation of brain symptoms in vivo have been demonstrated for immunoglobulin ig classes igm iga and igg.

however negative csf nmdar1-ab results cannot exclude chronic effects of serum nmdar1-ab on the central nervous system since the brain acts as immu- noprecipitator particularly in situations of compromised bbb.

nmdar are pivotal for regulating neuronalsynapse function and are also expressed by non-neuronal cell types in the brain like astrocytes oligo- dendrocytes or endothelial cells -.

in vivo studies in mouse and human suggest comparable effects of serum nmdar1-ab of all ig classes regarding modulation of brain functions see more details below.methods of ab detection--still room for improvementa still pending problem calling for standardization is the diversity of methods applied for ab determination with different speci- ficity and sensitivity.

the use of rat mouse human or monkey brain sections for immunohistochemical detection of specific ab may be a helpful addition providing supportive evidence.

these findings emphasize that not only degree but also duration of bbb dysfunc- tion acute versus chronic may play a pivotal role in syndrome shaping by nmdar1-ab.the brain as immunoprecipitator of nmdar1-abcirculating nmdar1-ab of all ig isotypes temporarily decreased after stroke .
