the field ofmicrobial forensics has expanded from strictly focusing on biothreat attribution to includemultiple areas of microbiome applications 32 and as such future studies should considermethod development as well as new statistical models to more accurately interpret microbiomedata and establish standards and validation criteria before microbiome profiling can be activelyused for investigative leads and attribution within the forensic scientific community.methodspublic skin microbiome dataset selection and downloadskin microbiome shotgun metagenomic datasets comprised of samples from 12 healthyindividuals across 17 body sites and sampled at different 3 time points were downloaded usingthe ncbi sra toolkit 27 using the program fastq-dump to download 2446 fastq filescorresponding to 585 samples from the sra 27 under bioproject accession prjna46333.sample collection and sequencing methods are described by oh et al.

variant calls and associated coverage for aligned metaphlan2 28 markersshared by all samples at a particular body site were determined using samtools 35 mpileup.only samples that met the following criteria for each body site were included in the study 50xmaximum coverage at any marker site within samples 10x average coverage across allmarkers and samples with all 3 time points for an individual table s1.

correlation-based feature subset selectionusing the cfssubseteval evaluator in weka 30 see methods resolves overlapping clustersfrom different individuals to produce more defined boundaries around samples from the sameindividual likely due to the reduction of redundant features contributing towards the same levelof variation.rmlr and 1nn classification were used to classify microbiome samples with respect totheir individual donor in the same manner as the assessment of presenceabsence markers.rmlr accuracies ranged from 66.67 at the inguinal crease ic to 100 at the cheek ch3.67- to 10-fold higher accuracy than by random chance respectively with a mean accuracy of87.21 table s3.

feature selection did not have a significant effecton classification accuracy table s5 indicating that using an average of 24 markers reducedfrom 1108 for presenceabsence features and an average of 32 markers reduced from 263 cladespecific markers resulted in comparable classification accuracies as using full sets of features.feature reduction helps eliminate markers which do not significantly contribute to microbiomeclassification table s5 thus eliminating potential noise and redundancy in signal and helpsselect for a reduced panel of candidate markers to be developed into a multiplex assay fortargeted sequencing assays for microbiome characterization.in this study the nucleotide diversities of subsets of clade-specific markers were used todifferentiate skin microbiomes samples from individuals sampled over relatively long timeintervals with a high degree of accuracy.

features of the personal microbiome such as strain-specific signatures 89 which may be stable over time make microbiome characterizationpotentially applicable to forensic human identification.current forensic human profiling methods typically utilize autosomal short tandemrepeats strs profiles to attribute forensic biological evidence to a suspect or victim 10.often evidentiary samples contain mixtures of human dna from multiple sources or contain lowamounts i.e.
