The field ofmicrobial forensics has expanded from strictly focusing on biothreat attribution to includemultiple areas of microbiome applications 32 and as such future studies should considermethod development as well as new statistical models to more accurately interpret microbiomedata and establish standards and validation criteria before microbiome profiling can be activelyused for investigative leads and attribution within the forensic scientific community.MethodsPublic skin microbiome dataset selection and downloadSkin microbiome shotgun metagenomic datasets comprised of samples from 12 healthyindividuals across 17 body sites and sampled at different 3 time points were downloaded usingthe NCBI SRA Toolkit 27 using the program fastq-dump to download 2446 fastq filescorresponding to 585 samples from the SRA 27 under bioproject accession PRJNA46333.Sample collection and sequencing methods are described by Oh et al.

Variant calls and associated coverage for aligned MetaPhlAn2 28 markersshared by all samples at a particular body site were determined using Samtools 35 mpileup.Only samples that met the following criteria for each body site were included in the study 50xmaximum coverage at any marker site within samples 10x average coverage across allmarkers and samples with all 3 time points for an individual Table S1.

Compared to the occiput Oc body site Methodswhich had medial classification accuracy samples collected from the volar forearm Vfp0.05 hypothenar palm Hp p0.01 manubrium Mb p0.001 and the check Chp0.05 had significantly higher odds of being classified correctly and samples collected fromthe ear Ea p0.001 had significantly lower odds for being classified correctly Table S5.BDiscussionA novel approach is described for the attribution of skin microbiome samples to theirindividual donors with a high degree of accuracy.

correlation-based feature subset selectionusing the CfsSubsetEval evaluator in Weka 30 see Methods resolves overlapping clustersfrom different individuals to produce more defined boundaries around samples from the sameindividual likely due to the reduction of redundant features contributing towards the same levelof variation.RMLR and 1NN classification were used to classify microbiome samples with respect totheir individual donor in the same manner as the assessment of presenceabsence markers.RMLR accuracies ranged from 66.67 at the inguinal crease Ic to 100 at the cheek Ch3.67- to 10-fold higher accuracy than by random chance respectively with a mean accuracy of87.21 Table S3.

Feature selection did not have a significant effecton classification accuracy Table S5 indicating that using an average of 24 markers reducedfrom 1108 for presenceabsence features and an average of 32 markers reduced from 263 cladespecific markers resulted in comparable classification accuracies as using full sets of features.Feature reduction helps eliminate markers which do not significantly contribute to microbiomeclassification Table S5 thus eliminating potential noise and redundancy in signal and helpsselect for a reduced panel of candidate markers to be developed into a multiplex assay fortargeted sequencing assays for microbiome characterization.In this study the nucleotide diversities of subsets of clade-specific markers were used todifferentiate skin microbiomes samples from individuals sampled over relatively long timeintervals with a high degree of accuracy.

In particular regularized multinomiallogistic regression RMLR and 1-nearest neighbor 1NN classification see Methods wereused to predict host individuals based on their microbiome signature taken at various time points.RMLR accuracies ranged from 66.67 at the ear Ea and interdigital web Id to 95.24 at thevolar forearm Vf 4.67- to 9.52-fold higher accuracy than by random chance respectively witha mean accuracy of 79.40 Table S2.

This study performsskin microbiome profiling from a supervised learning approach and obtains high classificationaccuracy for samples collected from individuals over a relatively long time period for potentialapplication to forensic human identification.48IntroductionThe human microbiome plays a critical role in health metabolism and immune response1 and can be influenced by numerous factors including but not limited to genetics geographydiet and hygiene 234.

While both approaches were highly accurate96.3 and 97.3 respectively the samples were collected over short time intervals  3 daysor just a single time point respectively 20 21 making their results less applicable to a typicalforensics setting.Individual-specific microbiome features with the greatest temporal stability up to almost3 years include single-nucleotide variant SNV profiles of Propionibacterium acnes from theskin 9 and gene signatures i.e.

Of the body sites assessed those that are likely of the greatest forensicrelevance--the Mb body site shirt and the Hp body site palm-- yield highly accurate rates ofclassification 9396 respectively using 1NN classification on nucleotide diversity withodds ratios of 2.64 and 2.60 respectively relative to that of a typical body site occiput OcTable S5.

The attribute-selectedloci had nearly identical classification accuracies as classification using all markers collectivelyFigure 5.To assess if our classification methods were robust to differences in time 1NNclassification accuracies with and without attribute selection were compared between theshortest sampling collection time points 2 vs. 3 5-10 weeks and longest sampling collectiontime points 1 vs. 3 2.5 years time intervals at each body site.
