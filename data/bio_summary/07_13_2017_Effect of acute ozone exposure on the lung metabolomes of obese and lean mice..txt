nevertheless effects of o3 on the lung metabolome have not been described in either lean or obese mice though changes in the lung metabolome do accompany pulmonary exposures to other inhaled irritants and infectious agents -.the purpose of this study was to perform global metabolomic profiling on lungs of obese dbdb mice and their lean wildtype c57bl6j controls exposed to air or o3 in order to iden- tify metabolites that could be contributing to the augmented responses to o3 observed in obese mice -.

metabolites involved in bcaa metabolism were also affected by db genotype.enrichment factor analysis also indicated a significant effect of o3 exposure on lipid metabo- lites particularly lysolipids and metabolites involved in carnitine metabolism.we performed a similar analysis on lung metabolites identified as being significantly affected by db genotype in either air or o3 exposed mice or significantly affected by o3 expo- sure in either wt or dbdb mice .

the decrease in lung heme was likely the result of increased expression of heme-oxygenase which catalyzes heme degradation and which is known to increase following o3 exposure .obesity-related differences in the effect of o3 exposure on the lung metabolomethere were several notable differences in the metabolites affected by o3 in dbdb versus wt mice tables and .

elevations in plasma acylcarnitines are typically observed when specific enzyme deficiencies prevent their metabolism via b-oxidation .consequently reductions in oleoylcarnitine stearoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine observed after o3 exposure likely reflect increased b-oxidation in lung cells.metabolism regulating hormones since corticosteroids promote b-oxidation  and also attenuate bcaa catabolism  similar to the result obtained in obese o3 exposed mice figs and  we hypothesized that greater o3-induced increases in corticosterone in dbdb than wt mice might account for the different effects of o3 on b-oxidation  and bcaalung long chain acylcarnitines in dbdb and wt mice exposed to air or ozone.

as the lung is one of the organs with the highest uptake of circulating gsh  it is pos- sible that the increase in gsh after o3  especially in lean mice is derived from non- pulmonary production of gsh rather than an increase in lung-derived gsh.given the observed increases in gsh with o3  we also examined o3-induced changes in pulmonary expression of glutathione-s-transferases gst to determine whether there were likely to be obesity-related differences in the glutathionylation of targets such as lipid peroxides that are generated by o3 exposure.

similarly lpcat3 is increased after o3 exposure in wt mice gse38014 but isunchanged in dbdb mice after o3 exposure and might account for the reductions in lysolipids observed in the wt mice.we also observed differential effects of o3 on the substrates used for energy production in the lungs of dbdb and wt mice figs and .

in this con- text it is important to note that in the study of miller et al  many of the metabolomic changes noted had substantially resolved by 18 hours after cessation of o3 exposure.of the 12 bacterial-mammalian co-metabolites identified in lungs of the mice in this study each one was affected by obesity by o3 exposure or by the combination of these two factors  suggesting a possible role for the microbiome in obesity-related differences in the response to o3.

hepatic steatosis is common in obesity  and could alter the effect of o3 on the liver.whether or not these bacterial-mammalian co-metabolites contribute to the functional and inflammatory changes observed in the lungs after o3 exposure andor the effect of obesity on these responses to o3  remains to be established.

hospital admis- sions and emergency room visits for asthma increase after days of high ambient o3 concentra- tions - and o3 causes airway hyperresponsiveness ahr  a canonical feature of asthma.

this does not alter our adherence to plos one policies on sharing data and materials.includes production of numerous cytokines and chemokines and recruitment of neutrophils  likely also contributes to the capacity of o3 to trigger asthma.obesity amplifies the impact of o3 on the lungs.

the lipid mobilization and increased glucose induced by o3 are consistent with effects of o3 on adipose tissue and liver tissues that are substantially altered in obese mice.

a false discovery rate fdr was computed to account for multiple comparisons.a p-value or q value 0.05 was considered statistically significant depending on whether individual metabolites q value or metabolites within a significantly affected pathway per fdr analysis p value were being assessed.resultsamong the 321 biochemicals identified in lung tissue two-way anova identified 171 that were significantly affected by db genotype 71 that were affected by o3 exposure and 14 for which there was an interaction between genotype and o3.

o3 exposure also caused significant changes in lung biochemicals in both wt and dbdb mice with the majority being reduced in the o3- versus air-exposed mice .below we first describe the metabolic pathways affected by db genotype and by o3 expo- sure using metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of the significantly affected metabolites from the two-way anova .

next we discuss the lung metabolomes of air-exposed dbdb versus wt mice the lung metabolomes of wt mice exposed to air versus o3 and the differential impact of o3 exposure on the lung metabolomes of dbdb versus wt mice in each case focusing on those metabolites in pathways identified in tables and .
