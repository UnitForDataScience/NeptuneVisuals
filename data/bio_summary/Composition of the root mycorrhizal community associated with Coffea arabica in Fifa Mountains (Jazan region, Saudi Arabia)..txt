Arbuscular- mycorrhizal fungi AMF constitute a key functional groupJ Basic Microbiol.

A number of studies have described the relationship of mycorrhizal symbiosis with coffee .

showed that coffee have high mycorrhizal dependency especially during the seedling formation stage.

Given the historical importance of coffee production in south-western Saudi Arabia the objective of this study was to describe the status of mycorrhizal fungi and to explore the community structure and taxon composition of AMF in coffeeC.

Spore density was expressed as the total number of spores per 100 g of soil  Assessment of AMF root colonizationIn the laboratory plant roots were washed with sterile water cleared by heating in 10 KOH at 90 degC for 1 h bleached by immersion in 10 H2O2 for 5 min acidified in dilute HCl and stained with 0.05 trypan blue in lactophenol Stained roots were checked for AMF infection by examination under a compound microscope and the mycorrhizal colonization percentage were obtained by the root slide technique Ninety root pieces 1 cm in length per plant were counted.

The highest coffee root mycorrhizal colonization was recorded in site 2 68.3 and 24.3 for frequency and intensity respectively compared to that of the field located in site 1 50.3 and 18.3 for frequency and intensity respectivelyFIGURE 1 Spores number of the AM fungi in the rhizosphere ofC.

These findings are consistent with earlier reports on AMF associated with the roots of Arabica coffee trees in Yemen A higher mycorrhizal colonization was registered in site 2.

This variability of the mycorrhizal intensity from one site to another can be explained by the differences in the physico-chemical properties of substrates temperature and rainfall.

Smith and Read showed that root colonization and plant mycorrhizal dependency are environment-dependent traits.Our results show that the density of AMF spores was relatively low which is common for coffee species in aridlands These low densities of AMF spores may be due to the presence of species with low sporulation capacity in those environments.
