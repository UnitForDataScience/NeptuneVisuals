The stool samples were isolated in Marseille France after obtaining the oral approval of the patient.

The ethics committee of the Institut Fed- eratif de Recherche IFR48 validated this study under the number 09-022.Strain cv3 was first isolated in January 2015 after lyophili- zation of the stool which was resuspended and incubated for 24 hours in aerobic atmosphere at 37degC on 5 blood-enriched Columbia agar bioMerieux Marcy l'Etoile France.

The clinical stool sample was then stored at 4degC before carrying out any experimentation.

Strain cv3 showed a 97.25 nucleotide sequence similarity with Brevi- bacterium senegalense strain JC43 accession no.

This similarity value is below the 16S rRNA gene sequence threshold of 98.65 set by Stackebrandt and Ebersto delineate a new species without carrying out DNA-DNA hybridization.
