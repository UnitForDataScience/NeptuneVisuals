thus it can be classified as a member of the genus brevibacterium within the family brevibacteriaceae and under the actinobacteriae phylum.we suggest the discovery of the new species 'brevibacterium ihuae' i.hu'ae n.l.

ihuae from the ihu institut hospitalo-universitaire where strain cv3 was isolated.

strain cv3t is the type strain of the new species 'brevibacterium ihuae.

the ethics committee of the institut fed- eratif de recherche ifr48 validated this study under the number 09-022.strain cv3 was first isolated in january 2015 after lyophili- zation of the stool which was resuspended and incubated for 24 hours in aerobic atmosphere at 37degc on 5 blood-enriched columbia agar biomerieux marcy l'etoile france.

strain cv3 showed a 97.25 nucleotide sequence similarity with brevi- bacterium senegalense strain jc43 accession no.
