Changes of the gut microbiota have been investi-gated in MS by sequencing 16S ribosomal r RNA that is encoded in bacteria and archaea but in nei- ther fungi nor viruses.45 Case-control studies showed that the microbiome of MS patients differs from that of controls although it is unknown whether the altered microbiota is a cause or result of the develop- ment of MS Table 3.

In addition to mammals the phylum Chordata includes vertebrata including fish and frogs and non-vertebrata such as sea urchins and sea anemones.In humans the gut microbiota consists of approxi- mately 1000 species of bacteria five genera of archaea 66 genera of fungi and as yet undetermined families of viruses including bacteriophages.3 Cur- rently most microbiota studies are focused on the community of bacteria bacteriome but not the other taxa.45 Healthy gut bacteriome mainly consist of two major phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and three minor phyla Actinobacteria Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia Table 1.67 The phylum Actinobacte- ria is a group of mostly Gram-positive bacteria which consists of 222 genera such as the genera Actinomyces Collinsella and Streptomyces.8 The phylumBacteroidetes is a group of Gram-negative bacteria which consists of 128 genera such as the genera Alistipes Bacteroides and Prevotella.9 The phylum Fir- micutes is a group of Gram-positive bacteria which consists of 241 genera including well-known patho- genic bacteria such as the genera Bacillus Clostrid- ium Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.10 The phylum Proteobacteria is the largest group of Gram-negative bacteria which consists of 452 genera that include a variety of pathogenic bacteria such as the genera Brucella Escherichia Helicobacter and Salmonella.11 The phylum Verrucomicrobia is a group of Gram-negative bacteria with wart-like prosthecae which consists of 12 genera including the genus Akkermansia.12Since the introduction of next-generation sequencing there has been a growing number of studies on the association between microbiota and diseases.13 In the present review article we first introduce how gut microbiota changes have beenTable 1 Classification of bacteria associated with multiple sclerosis and its animal modelsBacteroidetesBacteroidiaBacteroidalesBacteroidaceaeBacteroidesFragilisPorphyromonadaceaeButyricimonasParabacteroidesPrevotellaceaeAlloprevotellaPrevotellaCopriRikenellaceaeAlistipes S24-7FirmicutesBacilliLactobacillalesStreptococcaceaeStreptococcusClostridiaClostridialesSegmented filamentousbacteriaChristensenellaceaeClostridiaceaeClostridiumPerfringensEubacteriaceaeEubacteriumLachnospiraceaeAnaerostipes BlautiaRuminococcaceaeAnaerotruncus FaecalibacteriumProteobacteriaa-proteobacteriaRhizobialesBrucellaceaeMycoplanab-proteobacteriaBurkholderialesOxalobacteraceaeUndibacteriumOligocarboniphilumd-proteobacteriaDesulfovibrionalesDesulfovibrionaceaeBilophilaDesulfovibrioe-proteobacteriaCampylobacteralesHelicobacteraceaeHelicobacterPyloric-proteobacteriaEnterobacterialesEnterobacteriaceaePasteurellalesPasteurellaceaeHaemophilus PseudomonadalesPseudomonadaceaePseudomonasVerrucomicrobiaVerrucomicrobiaeVerrucomicrobialesAkkermansiaceaeAkkermansiaPhyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes are Gram-positive whereas phyla Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia are Gram-negative.associated with a variety of diseases and move on to discuss the role of gut microbiota in multiple sclero- sis MS its related neuromyelitis optica NMO and animal models.

In addition most microbiome studies showed only the ratio of bacterial taxa in the contents of organs suchas saliva and stool but did not quantify the total numbers of bacteria which require information about many parameters such as the total volume of the contents weight water content and intestinal transit time.146 Although microbiome associated with mucosa of the organs are more biologically sig- nificant than those in the contents of the organs147 mucosal microbiome analysis requires biopsy of the mucosal samples which is not feasible in many human studies.Microbiota changes can be the cause or outcome of diseaseThe changes in microbiota can be the cause or outcome of disease.3 This is true even in digestive diseases whose connection with gut microbiota appears to be straightforward.3 For example dys- biosis might only reflect constipation or diarrhea which changes the gut and colonic transit and fecal output.Discrepancy between experimental microbiota studies versus clinical primary immunodeficiency diseasesIn microbiota research despite the key defense role of innate immune components including neu- trophils and macrophages acquired immune com- ponents particularly IgA Th17 cells and Tregs have been studied more extensively in experimen- tal mice which have been proposed to influence the gut microbiota and their related diseases.148 Clinically however reports of primary immunode- ficiency diseases sometimes do not support the roles of such immune components.149 For example gain-of-function mutations in the STAT1 result in imbalanced STAT signaling reducing Th17 cells.150 The patients with the gain-of-function STAT1 mutation are characterized by susceptibility to oral and esophageal Candida infections whereas candidi- asis rarely appeared in other parts of the gastroin- testinal tract neither bacterial infections nor diarrhea are characteristic among the patients.IgA deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency disease151 for example the inci- dence in the Arabian peninsula and Spain is 1143 and 1163 respectively.

reuteri which naturally inhabits the mammalian gut have been clinically tried to prevent antibiotic- associated diarrhea.19The gut microbiota has been shown to play a cru- cial role in the induction of several immune compo- nents such as T helper Th1720 and MAIT cells.2122 Thus changes in the gut microbiota have been asso- ciated with inflammatory diseases particularly in the gastrointestinal tract Table 2.23 Inflammatory bowel diseases IBD have been considered to reflect interactions between microbes and the host24 changes in the gut microbiota have been reported in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.2526 Early childhood exposure to antibiotics is associated with an increased risk for Crohn's disease in which micro- bial diversity is diminished.2728 Necrotizingenterocolitis is another disease associated with the alteration of gut microbiota although the precise pathogenesis is unclear.

Although the precise pathophysiology of how fatty acids together with microbiota could contribute to CNS inflammation in EAE is unclear these results are intriguing as i some fatty acids are generated in the gut as fermen- tation products of dietary fibers by commensal bacte- ria7071 and ii MS-like CNS inflammation is induced in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy whose principal biochemical alteration is the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids.72Gut microbiota viral infections and a viral model for MSIn viral infections the gut microbiota has been shown to promote viral replication.

reported that gastric H. pylori infection altered the gastric and intestinal microbiota in mice.13710 pitfalls of microbiota studiesGut microbiota studies have a number of potential pitfalls.

The term microbiota does not include fungi viruses and parasitesAlthough the term microbiota should include bac- teria archaea fungi viruses protozoa and hel- minths the majority of the microbiota studies focused on the bacterial community bacteriome sequencing conserved 16S rRNAs but not on the fungal mycobiome or viral virome community.

Although this change is usually considered dysbiosis one might suggest that this could be an adaptation to the aged condition.157 Currently we do not know whether the Western diet is good or bad for senescence at least the average life expec- tancy is higher in industrialized Western countries than developing countries where people are eating more prebiotics.Effect of antibiotics treatment on systemic microbiota and the immune systemTo investigate the role of microbiota microbiota is depleted by antibiotics experimentally.

In many mouse studies antibiotics are provided through the most facile means available for example through the animal's water supply.158 While oral administra- tion of non-absorbable antibiotics such as neomycin147159-161 and vancomycin21 can affect mainly the gut microbiota some studies often use highly efficacious absorbable drugs such as metron- idazole73-75 and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole154 for complete microbiota depletion trimethoprimsul- famethoxazole can deplete even some fungi.82 Here the systemic effects of the absorbable antibiotics should be taken into account such as changes in other microbiota e.g.
