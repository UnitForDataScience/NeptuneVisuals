The presence of PAO1 also allowed VPI 4355 to achieve sustained stationary phase growth within the biofilm Figure Similar to its growth in biofilm PAO1 achieved stationary phase growth in the planktonic coculture Figure However while the CFU of VPI 4355 increased at 24 h the numbers of CFU declined over the rest of the time course with a significant drop in CFU between 48 and 72 h Figure These results suggest that in an aerobically incubated coculture P. aeruginosa supports the growth of F. nucleatum in both the planktonic and biofilm settings although the biofilm setting appears to support F. nucleatum survival and growth better than planktonic culture Figure .The Growth of P. aeruginosa Significantly Reduces the Level of Dissolved Oxygen in Broth.

Plates and tubes were then incubated aerobically at 37 C for up to 48 h.F. nucleatum within the biofilm transferred to the BHI plate maintained their growth for 8 h after transfer increasing 1 log but by 24 h after transfer the CFUdisk of F. nucleatum had declined sharply and by 48 h after transfer no F. nucleatum was recovered Figure P. aeruginosa however continued to grow throughout the 48 h after transfer Figure These results suggest that the growth of P. aerug- inosa within the dual-species biofilm provided F. nucleatum with sufficient protection from ambient oxygen to maintain its growth for a short time but P. aeruginosa could not protect against continued exposure to oxygen.

In a mixed-species biofilm some pathogenswithin the biofilm such as P. aeruginosa may primarily contribute to the EPS which protects all bacteria within the biofilm while others such as F. nucleatum may produce beta- lactamase protecting all the bacteria within the biofilm from beta-lactam antibiotics  .

These organisms did not produce biofilms when grown alone aerobically however in the presence of aerobicfacultative anaerobic bacteria these strict anaerobic species survived and grew in both planktonic and biofilm forms .In this study we investigated whether the growth of the facultative anaerobe P. aeruginosa would influence the sur- vival and growth of F. nucleatum under aerobic conditions either planktonically in a mixed biofilm or both.Materials and MethodsCollection and Processing of Patient Samples.

The presence of P. aeruginosa allowed F. nucleatum to maintain its growth for 72 h within the dual-species biofilm but not within the planktonic growth.

Previous studies showed that under aerobic conditions the growth of aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria within a biofilm reduces the level of oxygen present thereby facilitating the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria 1.

These results suggest that planktonic growth of Pseudomonas10101091081071061051041030PAO1 VPI 4355244872Hoursa10101091081071061051041030PAO1 VPI 4355244872HoursbFigure 4 P. aeruginosa supports the growth of F. nucleatum in both p6lanktonic and biofilm setting2 s under aerobic conditions.
