Although many of the bacteria can survive oxygen by mechanisms such as sporulation oxygen-free conditions are required for the anaerobic bacteria to grow .

Models using epithelial cells can be exposed to bacteria or bacterial extracts or products secreted by bacteria.

For such systems an additional barrier needs to be taken and that is to co- culture bacteria under anaerobic conditions while gut epithelialcells are provided with sufficient oxygen.Models for gut host-microbe interactionsAn in vitro gut host-microbe co-culture system would have many advantages for unraveling the direct role of gut bacteria in intestinal health provided that it is robust and truly simulates the gut ecosystem.

These Transwell co-culture sys- tems seem to be particular useful to study the interaction between bacteria mucosal immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells under static conditions but are more frequently used under aerobic conditions e. Recently a custom-made variant of such a Transwell co-culture system was developed that allows the analysis of host-microbe interactions between oxygen-requiring Caco- 2 cells and anaerobic F. prausnitzii bacteria for up to 8 h .

Global gene expression analysis of Caco-2 cells exposed for 4 h to either live or UV-killed F. prausnitzii revealed that live bacteria suppress cellular pathways involved in inflammatory response and immune cell trafficking much stronger than dead bacteria.

Key factors to consider are 1 whether a strict anaerobic compartment for gut bacteria is required 2 whether single or complex mixtures of bacteria need to be analyzed 3 whether direct contact with bac- teria and gut epithelial cells is important 4 whether analysis of the barrier function such as TEER is needed 5 whether effects on both gut epithelia as well as bacterial metabolism will be analyzed and maybe at least as important 6 whether the equipment and infrastructure is available to perform such experiments.

The tril- lions of bacteria that inhabit the gut of each individual belong to hundreds of different species .
