Considering the effects of maternal influences as well as captive rodents maintaining core members of the gut community from the wild it may be that the macronutrient content of the diets used in this study fell well within the range that arctic ground squirrels naturally experience in the wild and thus did not elicit a strong response in the gut microbial community.Gut microbial functionDespite the lack of changes in gut microbial composition and diversity diet treatment resulted in alterations in gut microbial function gene expression and SCFA production among diets but not across time.

While no studies have explicitly investigated the influence of diet on restructuring of the gut community after hibernation it may be that had we begun the diet manipulation immediately after terminating hibernation we would have observed differences in the gut microbiota and or host fattening among diet treatments this possibility warrants further investigation.Because diet and other environmental factors are known to influence a host's gut microbiota it is important to con- sider the squirrels' life history prior to capture and the effect of translocation to captivity from the wild.

Although our analy- ses did not uncover a definitive link between host fattening and the gut microbiota and suggest the squirrels may possess a gut microbial community structure that is unresponsive to dietary changes studies manipulating diet earlier in the active season may yet uncover a relationship between host diet fattening and gut microbiota.Received 3 May 2016 revised 24 February 2017 accepted 24 February 2017.

Also given the effect of diet on the gut microbial community of non- hibernators we postulated that diet composition would impact the gut microbiota of arctic ground squirrels with high fat diet consumption leading to lower total bacterial diversity and an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes compared to Bacteroidetes.

While we did not measure energy uptake in our squirrels and therefore cannot make inferences from this study about the role of gut microbiota on pre-hibernation fattening we did investigate the effect of a high-fat diet on the arctic ground squirrel gut microbial community.

While our results suggest that the gut microbial commu- nity of arctic ground squirrels may respond to fat composition of diets in a similar fashion to mice fed a high PS ratio diet it is also possible that our selected diets were not sufficiently different or extreme to elicit a response in the gut microbiota of a host that naturally experiences radical fluctuations in physiology and food availability annually.

Although we did not find increased relative abundance of specific taxa had we allowed squirrels to continue on the HF diet and sampled the gut microbiota after longer exposure we may have captured significant changes in the gut community reflecting the upregulation of ribosomal proteins by Clos- tridium Eubacterium and Lactobacillus.The abundances of metabolism- and cell motility- asso- ciated microbial transcripts are lower at T0 and for SD diet treatment than for all other treatment groups and the decrease in abundance of microbial transcripts is concomi- tant with a decrease in diversity of microbial taxa to which transcripts were assigned at both a phylum and genus lev- el.

Furthermore we found that diet did not alter gut microbial community composition and that despite changes in gut microbial function determined by metatranscriptome analysis SCFA production of the squirrels remained the same.

The gut microbial metatranscriptomes of squirrels on LF and RD diets for 5- weeks had lower relative abundances of Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-associated transcripts and greater relative proportions of Bacteroidetes- and Verrucomicrobia-associ- ated transcripts as compared to HF squirrels Fig.

HF squirrels contained a greater relative abundance of Firmi- cutes-associated mRNA and lower relative abundance of Verrucomirobia-associated mRNA in their gut than all squirrels fed any other diet Fig.
