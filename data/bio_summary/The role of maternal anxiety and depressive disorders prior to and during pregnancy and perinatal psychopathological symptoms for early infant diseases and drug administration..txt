unfortunately many studies merely focused on perinatal distress without consideration of lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders.aims to prospectively investigate associations of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy as well as perinatal distress with infants' inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and corresponding drug administration.study design prospective-longitudinal study initiated in 20092010.subjects n  306 expectant mothers with and without dsm-iv lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders composite international diagnostic interview for women and low vs. high severity of psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy brief symptom inventory enrolled in early pregnancy and repeatedly assessed during peripartum period.outcome measures infant inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and drug administration assessed via questionnaire maternal report at four months postpartum n  279.results severe psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy were associated with inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication whereas anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy were related to gastrointestinal complaints diarrhea colic complaints and corresponding medication.conclusions these results have to be discussed with caution because information on infants' diseases were based exclusively on maternal self-reports.

no associations to sociodemographic and perinatal factors were observed for respiratory tract infection other inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication.for subsequent analyses maternal age socioeconomic status parity infant sex birth weight gestational age mode of delivery and breast- formula feeding were considered as covariates in adjusted models.association of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and severe perinatal psychopathological symptoms with inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medicationas reported in  there were no significant associations be- tween maternal anxiety and depressive disorders with infant inflamma- tory diseases whereas women who reported severe psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy indicated more often other inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication of the infant.

in line with these results women with pure d and comorbid ad prior to pregnancy as well as women with pure a pure d and co- morbid ad prior to and during pregnancy reported significantly more often medication for gastrointestinal complaints.interestingly all associations between maternal pure and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders with medication for gastrointestinal complaints were attended to non-significance when conducting the analyses adjusting for gastrointestinal complaints prior to pregnancy ad aor 1.87 95ci 0.78-4.48 prior to and during pregnancy pure a aor 2.54 95ci 0.94-6.82 pure d aor 1.81 95ci 0.76-4.30 ad aor 1.99 95ci 0.83-4.78.discussionusing a prospective-longitudinal observational approach the associ- ation between maternal characteristics and mental health prior to and during pregnancy and infants' inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and medication was investigated.

moreover the association between maternal anxiety and depressive disorders and infant gastrointestinal complaints may be explained by an anxious misinterpretation of 'normal' infant signals or a transmission of adverse gut microbiota respectively.c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.backgroundinfant inflammatory diseases and gastrointestinal complaints are very common during early infancy rank among the most frequentabbreviations no ad no anxiety nor depressive disorder pure d pure depressive disorder pure a pure anxiety disorder comorbid ad comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders cidi-v composite international diagnostic interview for women bsi brief symptom inventory gsi global severity index.

overall the results remain conflicting with some studies finding no relation be- tween maternal prenatal distress anxiety and depression with infant infectious diseases and digestive illnesses .given the evidence that infants of anxious mothers are more likely to receive medication and the fact that an uncritical or even unneces- sary prescription of antibiotics might be attended by an increase of bac- terial resistancesreduced bacterial diversity  infants' medication should also be considered in research studies.thus this prospective-longitudinal study aims to examine the rela- tions between maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and severe perinatal psychopathological symptoms with infants' inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and drug administration four months postpartum.

since maternal report of infant diseases and drug administration may be biased by current maternal psychopatho- logical burden analyses are furthermore controlled for current anxiety and depressive disorders and severe psychopathological symptoms four months postpartum.methodsstudy designin the prospective-longitudinal maternal anxiety in relation to in- fant development study mari-study n  306 expectant mothers were recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy in the area of dresden from january 2009 until june 2010. assessments were conducted in approximately two-month intervals t1 week 10 to 12 of gestation t2 week 22 to 24 of gestation t3 week 35 to 37 of gesta- tion t4 10 days after delivery t5 2 months after delivery t6 4 months after delivery and additionally one year later t7 16 months after de- livery.

associations remained robust indicating that the administration of anti-infective medication was not solely explained by the occurrence of the considered inflammatory diseases.association of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and severe perinatal psychopathological symptoms with infant gastrointestinal complaints and corresponding medicationas reported in  maternal anxiety and depressive disorders were associated with infants' gastrointestinal complaints whereas se- vere perinatal psychopathological symptoms did not show any associa- tion in the adjusted analyses.

importantly diagnoses with an onset  4 weeks prior to baseline interview around the time when pregnancy is confirmed by a pregnancy test or by a gynecologist were considered as incident disorders during pregnancy.severity of psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy was assessed using the brief symptom inventory bsi  a validated and reliable self-report inventory with 53 items five-point likert scale referring to the last seven days .

second anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy were assessed dur- ing early pregnancy baseline interview and recall might have been bi- ased.
