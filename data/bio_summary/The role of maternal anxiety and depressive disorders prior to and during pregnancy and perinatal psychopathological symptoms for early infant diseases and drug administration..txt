Unfortunately many studies merely focused on perinatal distress without consideration of lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders.Aims To prospectively investigate associations of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy as well as perinatal distress with infants' inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and corresponding drug administration.Study design Prospective-longitudinal study initiated in 20092010.Subjects N  306 expectant mothers with and without DSM-IV lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women and low vs. high severity of psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy Brief Symptom Inventory enrolled in early pregnancy and repeatedly assessed during peripartum period.Outcome measures Infant inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and drug administration assessed via questionnaire maternal report at four months postpartum n  279.Results Severe psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy were associated with inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication whereas anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy were related to gastrointestinal complaints diarrhea colic complaints and corresponding medication.Conclusions These results have to be discussed with caution because information on infants' diseases were based exclusively on maternal self-reports.

Moreover the association between maternal anxiety and depressive disorders and infant gastrointestinal complaints may be explained by an anxious misinterpretation of 'normal' infant signals or a transmission of adverse gut microbiota respectively.c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

No associations to sociodemographic and perinatal factors were observed for respiratory tract infection other inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication.For subsequent analyses maternal age socioeconomic status parity infant sex birth weight gestational age mode of delivery and breast- formula feeding were considered as covariates in adjusted models.Association of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and severe perinatal psychopathological symptoms with inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medicationAs reported in  there were no significant associations be- tween maternal anxiety and depressive disorders with infant inflamma- tory diseases whereas women who reported severe psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy indicated more often other inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication of the infant.

Overall the results remain conflicting with some studies finding no relation be- tween maternal prenatal distress anxiety and depression with infant infectious diseases and digestive illnesses .Given the evidence that infants of anxious mothers are more likely to receive medication and the fact that an uncritical or even unneces- sary prescription of antibiotics might be attended by an increase of bac- terial resistancesreduced bacterial diversity  infants' medication should also be considered in research studies.Thus this prospective-longitudinal study aims to examine the rela- tions between maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and severe perinatal psychopathological symptoms with infants' inflammatory diseases gastrointestinal complaints and drug administration four months postpartum.

Associations remained robust indicating that the administration of anti-infective medication was not solely explained by the occurrence of the considered inflammatory diseases.Association of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and severe perinatal psychopathological symptoms with infant gastrointestinal complaints and corresponding medicationAs reported in  maternal anxiety and depressive disorders were associated with infants' gastrointestinal complaints whereas se- vere perinatal psychopathological symptoms did not show any associa- tion in the adjusted analyses.

Regarding gastrointestinal complaints a link between maternal depression and infant diarrhea was recently discussed and a number of studies have shown that infants' colic complaints are associated with maternal distress  anxiety and depression .Unfortunately many studies merely focused on perinatal distress without consideration of lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders.

Since maternal report of infant diseases and drug administration may be biased by current maternal psychopatho- logical burden analyses are furthermore controlled for current anxiety and depressive disorders and severe psychopathological symptoms four months postpartum.MethodsStudy designIn the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to In- fant Development Study MARI-Study N  306 expectant mothers were recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy in the area of Dresden from January 2009 until June 2010.
