These data reveal pronounced differences in gut microbiota composition between wild- type and Angptl4-- mice supplemented with TCA.Suppression of the gut microbiota abolishes the decrease in BA absorption in Angptl4-- mice after TCA supplementationTo investigate if the reduction in BA absorption in the Angptl4-- mice supplemented with TCA is dependent on the gut microbiota wild- type and Angptl4-- mice fed the TCA-supplemented diet were given antibiotics via the drinking water for 7 days.

Relative gene expression of B hepatic Angptl4 C ileal Angptl4 in wild-type and Angptl4-- mice fed chow CTRL or chow supplemented with TCA for 7 days.

Interestingly the expression of Angptl3 and Apoc3 two known inhibitors of LPL was strongly reduced upon TCA supplementation in both wild-type and Angptl4-- mice whereas the expression of Apoc1 Apoc2 and Apoa5 was not altered G suggesting that TCA might lower plasma triglycerides by downregulating Angptl3 andor Apoc3 expression H.Loss of ANGPTL4 leads to reduced BA absorption in TCA- supplemented miceAs expected the TCA-supplemented diet significantly increased total BA levels in plasma and total BA excretion in the faeces A  B. Intriguingly the total plasma BA concentration was sig- nificantly lower in the TCA-supplemented Angptl4-- mice as com- pared to the TCA-supplemented wild-type mice while faecal BA ex- cretion was significantly higher in the Angptl4-- mice A  B.

Since Angptl4-- mice had a significantly higher excretion of specifically primary BA it can be hypothesized that the lower ileal expression of Slc10a2 in Angptl4-- mice may be explained by differ- ences in intestinal BA composition between Angptl4-- and wild-type mice.Gut microbial composition potently influences intestinal BA meta- bolism and BA composition.

Accordingly mice lacking Angptl4 have re- duced plasma triglyceride levels whereas mice overexpressing Angptl4 have elevated plasma triglyceride levels as compared with wild-type mice .

Angptl4-- mice have been obtained via homologous recombination of embryonic stem cells and lack part of the Angptl4 gene resulting in a non-functional ANGPTL4 protein .

In contrast to our hypothesis that BA may down-regulate Angptl4 expression mRNA levels of Angptl4 were either unchanged liver B orFig.

The observation that differences in plasma BA between Angptl4-- and wild-type mice after TCA-supplementation were caused by differences in unconjugated cholic acid and deoxycholic acid without significant differences in tauroconjugates is indicative of decreased ileal BA absorption in the Angptl4-- mice.

Interestingly ileal expression of the BA transporter Slc10a2 Asbt was markedly lower in the Angptl4-- mice as compared to wild-type mice after TCA supplementation potentially contributing to the lower BA absorption B.In the liver total BA levels were also significantly lower in the TCA- supplemented Angptl4-- mice as compared to TCA-supplementedFig.

The explanatory variables diet and genotype explained 34.9 of the total variation in the microbiota composition.wild-type mice C. The lower hepatic BA levels and the reduced expression of Fgf15 in the ileum of Angptl4-- mice were associated with markedly higher hepatic expression of genes involved in BA synthesis including Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 whereas hepatic expression of other genes involved in BA metabolism was not or only slightly dif- ferent between the Angptl4-- and wild-type mice D Supp.
