in some special cases we administered fmt during gastroscopy injecting the suspension into the duodenum as distally as possible.although fmt has become the routine treatment after two relapses for cdi in our hospital the decision to assess fmt in immunosuppressed patients and in special indications is based on a very thorough consideration especially of safety concerns by gast roenterologist specialist of infectious diseases and microbiologist with fmt experience.thirteen patients treated with fmt for rcdi and havingsignificant comorbiditiesin this article we report the results of thirteen patients with major comorbidities who underwent rcdi and were treated with fmt table 1. two of the patients had hiv six were haemodialysis patients two had a kidney transplant two had a liver transplant and one had chronic lymphatic leukaemia cll.eleven of the thirteen rcdi patients 85 treated with fmt successfully cleared the cdi.
