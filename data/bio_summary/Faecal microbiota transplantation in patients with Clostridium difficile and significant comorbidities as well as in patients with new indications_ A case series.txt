FMT is only indicated for rCDI for other indications FMT should still be performed only in a clinical trial setting.Case characteristicsThe authors reviewed 21 fecal microbiota transplantation FMT-treated patients of which 13 had recurrent Clostridium difficile infection rCDI and major comorbidities two human immunodeficiency virus patients six haemodialysis patients two kidney transplant patients two liver transplant patients and a patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia.

In our cohort FMT appeared to be safe and effective for immuno- compromised patients dialysis patients human immu- nodeficiency virus patients solid organ transplant patients and a patient with chronic lymphatic leuka- emia.
