Compared to the HFD group the DG group had significantly lower plasma glu- cose levels 156.42 - 8.49 mgdL to 137.48 - 4.93 mgTable 2 Morphometric and metabolic parameters at the end of studydL P  0.01 total cholesterol 116.88 2.56 mgdL to 77.85 0.33 mgdL P  0.01 and LDL cholesterol 23.91 0.16 mgdL to 14.89 0.08 mgdL P  0.01.HDL cholesterol was significantly higher in the DG group compared to the HFD group 22.41 0.43 mgdL vs.18.55 0.54 mgdL P  0.01.

However the group fed DG with HFD DG group showed significantly lower mean body weight than the HFD group 527.17 23.44 g vs. 607.15 3.16 g P  0.01.

Interest- ingly IL-6 levels in the DG group were similar to that in the ND group whereas TNF-a and MCP-1 levels in the DG group were significantly lower than those in the ND group.Table 3 Identification of serum metabolitesGroupa IdentificationMeanbP valuecFold change NDCHFDCHFDDGHFDNDHFDHFDDGHFDNDIdentification of serum metabolites significantly altered by HFD andor HFDDGa The identified mass ions are grouped on the basis of two-way hierarchical clustering analysis marked in Fig.

HFD also resulted in increased liver weight which was significantly lower in the DG group 19.05 0.07 g and 16.23 0.3 g P  0.01.As shown in Table  HFD feeding for 8 weeks ele- vated plasma glucose cholesterol and LDL compared to the ND group.

Interestingly a sig- nificant triglyceride reduction was observed in DG group compared to the HFD group 37.8 0.23 mgdL and46.08 3.48 mgdL P  0.05 suggesting decreased lipo- proteins.

By contrast the level of Firmicutes was increased in HFD group com- pared with the ND group P  0.05 week 4.
