however the group fed dg with hfd dg group showed significantly lower mean body weight than the hfd group 527.17 23.44 g vs. 607.15 3.16 g p  0.01. hfd also resulted in increased liver weight which was significantly lower in the dg group 19.05 0.07 g and 16.23 0.3 g p  0.01.as shown in table  hfd feeding for 8 weeks ele- vated plasma glucose cholesterol and ldl compared to the nd group.

a major change induced by hfd was significant reduction in the level of bacteriodetes compared with that of the nd group p  0.01 week 4 and 8. by contrast the level of firmicutes was increased in hfd group com- pared with the nd group p  0.05 week 4. the effects of dg administration on the respective levels of bacte- riodetes and firmicutes were in sharp contrast.
