cited evidence of Tbet inducing IL-23R expression more recent evidence suggests that RORgt is the principal transcription factor required for this and that Tbet in fact can inhibit IL-23R expression.

would speak against a role for the expression of surface B27 multimers in pathogenesis since protective ERAP1 alleles increase their expression.

Thus some feature of the expression of B27 led to changes in the microbiota by 10 weeks and analysis of cytokine mRNA expression in the gut revealed increases in TNFaand IL-1b together with increases in anti-microbial peptides.

The debate on how HLA-B27 is implicated in inflammation is also considered together with recent and contradictory evidence on the effects of the peptide-trimming enzyme ERAP1 on B27 expression and hence susceptibility to spondylitis.

Other characteristics also pointed to this capacity such as the expression of CCR6 the cells described by Sherlock et al.

The new report emphasises the role of a gd subset in relation to IL-23R expression and hence an ability to respond to raised IL-23 levels and therefore IL-17 production.

Whilst this might suggest that inflammation is needed for the effects of the SNP on expression levels to be manifest levels in AS patients were independent of disease activity.

Proportions of Tbet cells were also elevated in AS especially CD8 cells and levels of expression of Tbet were also higher in these cells.

However precisely how Tbet expression favours the emergence of a poten- tially pathogenic CD8 T cell population producing both IL-17 and IFNg is not yet clear.

Since IL-23 is central to the SpA disease in SKG mice and is also implicated in human SpA with both genetic and therapeutic evidence this paradoxical effect of Tbet on IL-23R expression is puzzling and requires further work.
