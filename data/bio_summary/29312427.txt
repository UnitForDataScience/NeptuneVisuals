Recently the use of high-throughput sequencing and microbial-specific databases have provided deep insights into the composition of above- and belowground compartments of various host plants including Arabidopsis thaliana        barley Hordeum vulgare L.   corn  grapevine   lettuce    potato Solanum tuberosum L.    tomato   rice Oryza sativa L.  sugarcane Saccharum officinarum L.   and soybean  .

These findings may also help to make the PH production process more efficient in producing bioactive peptides.Effectively manipulating plant microbiomes with PHs will require additional research to answer questions such as how do individual microbial taxa respond to specific amino acids and other compounds in PHs what is the optimal dose time and mode of application to support specific microbial taxa that improve plant fitness how much will plant species genotype and the environment affect these relationships can PHs be formulated with specific compounds to better support colonization and survival of microbial inoculants and will PHs need to be combined with inoculants that contain a microbial consortia with synergistic traits thus providing more consistent effects Application of new 'omics' sciences and high- throughput phenotyping platforms will aid in these studies though partnerships between academic researchers and private industry will be required due the high costs of these studies.

Several studies have demonstrated that many commercial products obtained from PHs elicited hormone-like activities auxin and gibberellins promoting root and shoot growth and thus crop productivity        .In addition to the direct effect of PHs indirect effects on growth and plant nutrition have been also demonstrated when PHs were applied to soils and plants  .

In addition to stimulation of fresh weight application of degraded soybean meal products increased the root hairs characteristics number and length of Brassica oleracea L. Lactuca sativa L. Trifolium incarnatum L. and Gypsophila elegans M. Bieb.

Moreover in the last years some companies introduced plant-derived PHs in the United States European and Asian market these plant-derived PHs are gaining greater acceptance by farmers due to their richness in bioactive compounds and their great efficacy in enhancing cropperformances.In many cases PHs have been demonstrated to play key roles as biostimulants through the modulation of plant molecular and physiological processes that trigger growth increase yield and alleviate the impact of abiotic stress on crops   .

The penetration of active ingredients amino acids and peptides into internal structures of PH-treated plants is crucial since PHs based biostimulant are usually foliarly applied    .The biostimulant activity observed in response to the application of PHs could be acting at least in part indirectly through a microbially mediated enhancement of plant health  .

In contrast to studies demonstrating positive effects of PHs on plants other experimental studies have found that foliar or root application of PHs has been minimal or non-significant        .

However mechanisms regulating the beneficial effects of PHs on plants are not completely understood and only recently thanks to use of 'omics' sciences is it becoming possible to clarify specific modes of action.Recent studies have provided evidence that PHs can affect plant microbiomes and some of the benefits derived from these products might be due in part to changes in the composition and activity of these plant-associated communities.
