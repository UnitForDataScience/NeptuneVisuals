stratifying by dietary types the proportion of firmicutes was lower and of bacteroi- detes was higher in strict vegetarians when compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarians and omnivores.

stratifying according to dietary type66 were strict vegetarians 102 lacto-ovo-vegetarians and 100 omnivores and groups did not differ according to male-to-female ratios and age 49.6 - 8.5 49.6 - 8.649.1 - 8.2 years p  0.878 respectively.

lower frequencies of obesity hypertension and pre-diabetes were observed in the strict vegetarians similar to the results of the adventist health study-2   and also coherent with reports of fewer cardiovascular events in strict vegetarians   .

therefore despite belonging to the firmicutes phy- lum roseburia and faecalibacterium genera were shown to be associated with a beneficial metabolic profile in our vegetarians characterized by lower body adiposity and better lipid profile and insulin resistance index which are along the same line of previous reports  .bacteroidetes were relatively more frequent in the microbiota of strict vegetarians than in omnivores and their subpopulations were mainly composed of the gen- era prevotella and bacteroides.

we hypoth- esized that dietary-dependent microbial composition influences inflammatory status insulin resistance andcardiovascular risk in individuals undergoing distinct dietary habits.the aims of this study were to describe the abundance of major phyla and genera in the gut microbiota of non- diabetic brazilians classified according to dietary types strict vegetarian lacto-ovo-vegetarian and omnivore and to compare their inflammatory status insulin resist- ance index and cardiovascular risk profile.methodssubjectsa convenience sample of first 300 participants from the advento  aged 35-65 years old was invited to join in this cross-sectional analysis.

inflammatory markers exhibited a gradual and significant increase from the vegetarians and lacto-ovo- vegetarians to the omnivorous group.conclusions there are differences in gut microbiota composition of individuals with distinct dietary habits who differ according to their inflammatory and metabolic profiles.

non-diabetic brazilians undergoing distinct dietary types showed that vegetarians had a more favorable gut microbiota composition characterized by less firmicutes and more bacteroidetes than omnivores.

clinical biochemical and circulating inflammatory markers were com- pared by anova or kruskal-wallis test.results the sample 54.2 women mean age 49.5 years was composed of 66 strict vegetarians 102 lacto- ovo-vegetarians and 100 omnivores.

panel a and a higher prevo- tellabacteroides ratio 8.4 - 0.3 than the other groups.on the other hand strict vegetarians had a lower pro- portion of faecalibacterium genus from the firmicutes phylum than lacto-ovo-vegetarians and both vegetar- ian groups had higher proportions than in omnivores fig.

fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids scfa mainly butyrate acetate and propionate are facilitated by the presence of certain commensal bacteria that belong to phylum firmicutes -.our findings of lower proportion of firmicutes and higher proportion of bacteroidetes in strict vegetarians compared to omnivores may not be attributed to the dif- ferences in body adiposity of the participants.

in fact a meta-analysis did not confirm previous assumptions based on from animal and human studies that obesity was associated with an increased fb ratio  .analyzing particularly the firmicutes subpopulations we found that strict vegetarians had an increased abun- dance of the two most recognized butyrate-producing bacteria--roseburia and faecalibacterium   in comparison with omnivores.

since these participants were exposed to this kind of animal foods and an intermediate cardiometabolic risk level between the strict vegetarians and omnivores was expected.

dna wassus 26 95 ci 17-34 and 33 95 ci 24-43 werehigher in the omnivores than in lacto-ovo-vegetarians and strict vegetarians respectively.thirteen phyla were identified and five were present in all the fecal samples analyzed.

samples were clustered intoweight excess considering the whole sample as well as within each dietary type.the abundance of otus according to dietary types was also compared at genus level.
