a ngt group of kazaks b dm2 group of kazaks c ngt group of uygurs d dm2 group of uygurs.doi10.1371journal.pone.0172774.g007our data indicated that the ruminococcaceae lachnospiraceae and enterobacteriaceae are the three dominant bacterial families in both healthy and dm2 patients of the kazaks and uygurs.

the maximum variations by pca were 42.7 pc1 and 27 pc2 in the ungt and 47.7 pc1 and 26.6 pc2 in udm2group .comparison of intestinal microbiota between the uygurs and kazakssignificant differences in intestinal microbiota were found between the uygurs and kazaks especially between the kngt group and the ungt group and between the kngt and the differences of the gut microbial communities at family level between kngt and kdm2 groups.numbers in bold letters indicate families that are enriched.doi10.1371journal.pone.0172774.t003pca analysis of the core gut microbiota of uygurs and kazaks.

however analysis of the species richness and diversity indices chao1 ace shannon npshannon and simpson showed no significant differences between the kdm2 and kngt groups  suggesting that the differences were found mainly at the family level.comparison of intestinal microbiota between ngt and dm2 groups of uygursno major differences in intestinal microbiota were found between the ungt and udm2 groups figs and  except that the microbiota in the udm2 group showed a significant decrease of erysipelotrichaceae 5.56 compared with the ungt group 1.46. the average otus of the ungt and udm2 groups were slightly different but the difference was not statistically significant p  0.05 .

also excluded were the patients with the following conditions history of mental illness or drug abuse surgery undergone or with other emergency situations taking antibiotics steroids or probiotics within the previous year obvious liver and kidney dysfunction gastrointestinal diseases or serious diseases of the blood or the endocrine systems severe heart diseases systolic bloodpressure  160 mmhg and diastolic blood pressure  95 mmhg requiring insulin treatment or with a history of ketoacidosis type i diabetics gestational diabetics or other particular types of diabetics.the uygurs and kazaks groups were each stratified equally into those with dm2 udm2 and kdm2 respectively and those with normal glucose tolerance ungt and kngt result- ing in 4 groups of 10 persons each.

in addition the ages between dm2 and ngt individuals in either the uygurs or kazaks were also significantly different with the ngt groups younger than the dm2 groups tables and .

cluster analysis of the different groups showed that the ngt of kazaks and uygurs were clustered  further suggesting that the intestinal microflora composi- tion of these two groups is different.

considering that the kazaks have a much lower rate of dm2 this results sug- gest that the higher number of microbes in the kazaks of normal glucose tolerance may be beneficial.more research is underway to determine the possible beneficial microbes in the kazaks eth- nic group that could potentially be used to prevent or reduce dm2 in a larger community.in conclusion our study revealed a significant difference in gut microbiota between dm2 and healthy individuals as well as between different ethnic groups in northwest china.

in addition the ngt and dm2 of kazaks were also clustered.discussionin this study we report a comparison of the gut microbiota of two ethnic groups the uygurs and kazaks in the northwest and southwest region of xinjiang in china.

p  0.05 was consid- ered statistically significant.resultsphysical and biochemical indices of the uygurs and kazaksno statistical differences were found regarding gender or height between the dm2 and ngt individuals in either the uygurs  or kazaks  groups.

to under- stand better the prevalence of dm2 in the uygurs and kazaks people of xinjiang and features associated with the gut microbiome in dm2 we investigated the gut microbiome of 40 uygurs and kazaks people using the conserved v6 region of the bacterial 16s ribosomal dna .

in a 2005-2007 survey the uygurs showed a much higher prevalence of dm2 than the kazaks .clustering analysis of each group of kazaks and uygurs at the bacterial family level.
