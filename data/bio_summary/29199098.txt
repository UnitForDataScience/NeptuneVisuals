Because purine metabolites can function as important im- mune signaling molecules   these data suggest that the INF metabolite signature indicated a local induction of host immunity.PLS-DA of the peritoneal samples from all four treatment groups onto the union of metabolites from the ABX and INF signa- tures revealed that antibiotic treatment and infection formed two orthogonal di- mensions describing the infection micro- environment with 88 calibration accu- racy and 83 cross-validation accuracy C in close agreement with the unsupervised PCA of these samples  C. This was supported by the obser- vation that udp g6p and ru5p under com- bination treatment trended similarly to antibiotic treatment and gmp and adn trended similarly to infection B.

CollinsCorrespondenceIn BriefAntibiotic susceptibility is sensitive to metabolites but how this affects in vivo treatment efficacy remains unexplored.

COMB samples also scored higher than the ABX samples on the antibiotic axis LV 2 suggesting that infection may potentiate the metabolic changes elicited by anti- biotic treatment C. To test this we performed elasticnet regularization and used PLS-DA to identify a COMB-specific metabolite signature discriminating the COMB samples from the union of CTL ABX and INF samples.

Compared with untreated cells macro- phages pre-treated with 20 mgmL cipro for 3 hr ABX engulfed fewer E. coli cells C and S5A and possessed more sur- viving cells following lysis of the macrophages D and S5B indicating a significant decrease in the killing of engulfed cells E. In contrast we found that 10 mM amp signifi- cantly increased pathogen engulfment C and S5C and decreased pathogen survival D and S5D indicating that metabolites induced at the site of infection by an- tibiotics may feed forward and potentiate immune function.

Together these results indicate that antibiotic-induced changes to host metabolites and metabolic processes can significantly affect both treatment efficacy and immune function.Cell Host  Microbe 22 757-765 December 13 2017 a 2017 Elsevier Inc. 757RESULTSAntibiotic Treatment Depletes Central Metabolism Intermediates in the PeritoneumTo determine whether antibiotics alter metabolites in the host environment we quantified metabolites in samples from mice receiving antibiotic treatment bacterial infection or their combi- nation.

Respiratory capacity was computed as the differ- ence in oxygen consumption rate following FCCP treatment and following rotenoneantimycin A.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISExperimental ReplicatesAll in vivo metabolomic quantification experiments were performed using n  3 mice in each treatment condition with samples pre- pared in technical duplicate yielding n  6 samples for each condition.

In contrast infection only exerted local changes eliciting significant changes in metabolites in the peritoneum C but not in the plasma Figure S1A or lung Figure S1B.To better understand the antibiotic-induced changes in the infection microenvironment we performed multivariate analysis on the peritoneal samples to identify a metabolite signature corresponding to antibiotic treatment.

PCA on the plasma samples similarly revealed that 83 of the variance in plasma metabo- lites could be explained by direct effects on host cells instead of effects on the microbiome D. In contrast the lung samples did not separate as cleanly along principal compo- nents corresponding to a microbiome and antibiotic treatment Figure S3.
