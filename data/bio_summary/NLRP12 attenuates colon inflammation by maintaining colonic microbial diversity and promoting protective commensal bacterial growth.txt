However CoHo Nlrp12-- mice displayed attenuated activation of NF-kB during DSS-induced colitis relative to that of SiHo Nlrp12-- mice  which suggested that the altered microbiota of Nlrp12-- mice also contributed to their heightened activation of NF-kB.To investigate the causality between the hyperactivation of NF-kBand the altered microbiota in Nlrp12-- mice we performed recip- rocal fecal-microbiota FM transplantation experiments in which GF wild-type mice were reconstituted with the microbiota of SPF Nlrp12-- mice FMNlrp12---GF WT and GF Nlrp12-- mice were reconstituted with the microbiota of SPF wild-type mice FMWT-GF Nlrp12-- mice via oral gavage once a week for 3 weeks as described.

These data demonstrated that the microbiota transferred from wild-type mice ameliorated disease susceptibility in Nlrp12-- mice in a cohousing setting.The experiments with Nlrp12 and Nlrp12-- littermates and GF mice suggested that the dysregulation of NF-kB occurred before altera- tions in the microbiota as Nlrp12-- mice developed a microbiome dif- ferent from that of their Nlrp12 littermates after weaning  and GF Nlrp12-- mice displayed greater basal colon inflammation than that of GF wild-type mice when colonized .

are pooled two independent experiments with n  10 mice WT and n  14 mice Nlrp12-- d or are from three independent experiments ef.This was in contrast to the improved survival and diminished colitis of CoHo Nlrp12-- mice and made Nlrp12 deficiency the first case to our knowledge in which enhanced susceptibility to colitis resulting from an NLR deficiency was reversed by the transfer of normal microbiota.To investigate in detail the changes in the microbiome after cohousing of wild-type mice with Nlrp12-- mice we performedgene-microbiome- sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA in feces from wild-type and Nlrp12-- mice before and after cohousing .

The distance between the Nlrp12-- mice inoculated with BHI vehicle and Nlrp12-- mice inoculated with Lachnospiraceae was as large as the distance between the wild-type mice inoculated with BHI vehicle and Nlrp12-- mice inoculated with BHI vehicle  which indicated that the microbiome in Nlrp12-- mice inoculated with Lachnospiraceae was significantly distinct from that of their Nlrp12-- littermates inoculated with BHI vehicle.
