Guaymas Basin GB a hydro- thermally active seafloor-spreading center in the Gulf of California is characterized by high primary production rapid sedimentation and deposition and hydrothermal pro- cessing of buried organic matter within its massive sedi- ment cover Hydrothermal alterations transform the deposited carbon and produce large amounts of methane petroleum-like compounds alkanes and polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbons PAHs organic acids and ammonia - These substrates get distributed throughout the sediments by hydrothermal circulation and are readily assimilated by the local microbial community  For example hydrothermal fluids containing high concentra- tions of methane  15 mM mixing with seawater sulfate 28 mM favor the anaerobic oxidation of methane AOM which occurs at high temperatures in Guaymas Basin sedi- ments -AOM is usually carried out in a syntrophic relationship between anaerobic methanotrophic ANME archaea and members of the Deltaproteobacteria that couple the oxidation of methane with the reduction of sulfate In hydrothermal sediments of Guaymas Basin AOM is also performed at high temperatures by a syn- trophic consortium of ANME-1 archaea and the deeply- branching hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducing bacterium Candidatus Desulfofervidus auxilii - In contrast to this well-studied interaction little is known about the deg- radation of other abundant hydrocarbons such as PAHs and alkanes by the GB microbiome.The microbial community composition of GB sedimentshas been thoroughly described using marker-gene studies  .

Addition- ally selecting a wider dataset including sites spanning a broader depth and temperature profile will help deter- mine whether the functional diversity in this study reflects the diversity present in hydrothermal vents as a whole.ConclusionsGB hydrothermal vent sediments are hotspots for microbial carbon cycling and contain high concentrations of methane and hydrocarbons including alkanes and PAHs The metabolic reconstruction of 115 new microbial MAGs revealed the substrate-dependent connectivity among deep- sea inhabiting microorganisms.

methane concentrations dissolved organic carbon concentrations sulfate and sulfide con- centrations as well as thermal profiles of the sampling site are available to compare microbial community com- position across sediment cores   For 4484-1 full metadata are included in Dowell et al.

The high abundance of both taxa is expected as both sediment locations are covered by dense Beggiatoaceae mats and Methanosarcinales have been previously defined as abun- dant community members The reconstruction of MAGs sheds light on the meta- bolic potential of individual community members.

Metagenomic reads from dive 4484 and 4572 concatenated per depth profile for better coverage were individually assembled using IDBA-UD using the following parameters -precorrec- tion -mink 75 -maxk 105 -step 10 -seedkmer 55 This yielded a total of 3139208 and 1595687 scaffolds from sample 4484 and 4572 respectively including scaffolds with a minimum and maximum scaffold length ranging from 200 to 177401 bp maximum scaffold length for sample 4484 and 4572 177401 and133414 respectively.Metagenomic binning was performed on assembled samples from dive 4484 and 4572 by calculating tetranu- cleotide frequencies of scaffolds with a minimum length of 5000 bp including a total of 58488 scaffolds with a total length of 591330171 bp The resulting Emer- ging Self-Organizing Maps ESOM were manually sorted and curated Additional file Figure S1 Metagenomic binning was enhanced by incorporating reference genomes as genetic signatures for the assem- bled contigs into ESOM  Thereby we assembled77 bacterial and 38 archaeal metagenomic assembled genomes MAGs with a completeness above 50.
