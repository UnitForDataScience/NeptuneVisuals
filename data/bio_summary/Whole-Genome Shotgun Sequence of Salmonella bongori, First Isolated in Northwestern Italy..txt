A total of 4446 coding sequences were annotated in various functional catego- ries including biological processes and metabolism 1836 genes cellular components 431 genes and molecular functions 828 genes.

The genomic content of the isolates was analyzed for potential genes that may be involved in virulence and antibiotic resistance.

Phylogenetic analysis and comprehensive Salmonella evolution studies have suggested the genomic relationship between S. bongori and an ancestral Salmonella virulence gene set which has been adapted by incorporating virulence determinants highly similar to those found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli .

Here we report the whole-genome shotgun sequence of S. bongori a fecal isolate from a 1-year old symptomatic patient in Piedmont in northwestern of Italy.
