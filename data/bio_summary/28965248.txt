No change in liver weight normalized to body weight was observed among the treatment groups data not shown.Cecum microbiota SCFA concentration cecum content weight and total DNA in mice fed the HFHS diet supplemented with tea extractsCecum weight and DNA content normalized to body weight was significantly increased in mice fed the HFHS-GTP and BTP diets while feeding the LFHS diet had no effect compared to the HFHS diet Supplemental Fig.

48 male C57BL6J mice strain JAX 000664 were received from the Jackson Laboratory at 6-7 weeks of age body weight 16-18 g. After 1 week of acclimation 28-day-old male C57BL6J mice were assigned to four groups with similar body weight distribution in each group and fed either a low-fathigh- sucrose diet LFHS D12489B from Research Diets Inc. New Brunswick NJ USA high-fat HFHS D12266B from Research Diets Inc.

During the 4-week dietary interven- tion the HFHS-treated mice had significantly higher body weight and subcutaneous and epididymal fat by weight Fig.

Supplementation of the HFHS diet with GT and BT polyphenols significantly decreased body weight subcutaneous mesenteric and epididymal fat normalized to body weight compared to HF HS control equal to the body composition of mice fed the LFHS diet Fig.

The two most abundant bacterial phyla in humans and in mice are Firmicutes 40-60 and Bacteroidetes 20-40 with lower abundance of Actino- bacteria Fusobacteria Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia .

The samples were kept in sealed bags at room temperature before extraction.Tea polyphenol extract preparation500 g of tea leaves were extracted with 2 L of 75 ethanol in water at room temperature for 3 h. The leaves were sepa- rated and the procedure was repeated twice.

The difference in relative proportioncompared to mice fed the HF HS control diet was significant for all bacteria included in thefigure P  0.05Turicibacter and Marvinbryantia.

In our previous study using the same GTP and BTP supplemented diets we found 540 pmol of polyphenols EGCG 4''-meEGCG EGC and ECG per g liver in mice fed the HFHS-GTP diet whereas only 20 pmolg liver of ECG was found in mice fed the HF HS-BTP diet .
