Moreover some PD-L1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in plasma DNA of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab such as rs2282055and rs4143815 have been associated with an improved clin- ical benefit .In conclusion although the expression of PD-L1 in tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been related with clinical benefit from immune checkpoint blockade  the lack of an absolute and exclusive correlation between PD-L1 expression and response demonstrates that this biomarker might not be considered sufficient alone to explain the rates of durable responses observed in patients with various cancer types .Mutational load mutation-associated neoantigens and other genomic eventsAmong the current candidate biomarkers for immunotherapy the study of the mutational load and the related mutation- associated neoantigens MANA appears to be a promising field for deeper investigations.

Regarding this two recent harmonization studies identified limits in the concor- dance interobserver rates particularly in the analysis of immune cells and at low PD-L1 scores .Considering the technical and biological issues related to PD-L1 expression other PD-L1 alterations have been investi- gated as potential predictive tools with preliminary results.

When the tumor cells present on their surface the PD- L1 andor the PD-L2 they can bind to PD-1 receptor on T cellsand downregulate the specific cytotoxic immune response inducing T cell exhaustion and therefore immune tolerance .PD-1Nivolumab PembrolizumabPD-L1Atezolizumab Durvalumab AvelumabCTLA-4Ipilimumab TremelimumabFully human IgG4 Humanized IgG4 kappaEngineered IgG1 Engineered IgG1 Humanized IgG1Fully human IgG2 Human IgG1Therefore the idea of developing therapeutical monoclonal anti- bodies occupying the PD-1 receptor and rendering PD-L1 unablePD-1 programmed death-1 PD-L1 programmed death-ligand 1 CTLA-4 cyto- toxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4.Table 3.

These genomic alterations lead to the elimination of epitopes able to generate functional immune responses thus decreasing the immunogenicity of the tumor as part of the immune editing process .Limitations of mutational load as a predictive biomarkerAlthough the consistency of data across different types of tumor the association between neoantigen burden and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is not absolute and its role as a potential biomarker for immunotherapy presents relevant limita- tions to be considered related to the biomarker and to the complexity of the immune response.

Another recent network meta-analysis considering only studies in NSCLC reported in PD-L1-negative patients an ORR of 13 increasing concurrently to PD-L1 expression .Limitations of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarkerThe role of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for immunother- apy is strongly limited by the evidence that also patients affected by PD-L1-negative tumors might respond to the PD-1PD-L1 blockade .

Median PFS was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mgkg 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mgkg and 4.0 months with docetaxel with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg kg versus docetaxel 0.88 0.74-1.05 p  0.07 or for pembrolizumab 10 mgkg versus docetaxel HR 0.79 95 CI 0.66-0.94 p  0.004.In the case of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab development PD-L1 expression detection antibody SP142 assay was evaluated on both tumor TC and tumor-infiltrating immune cells IC and a different score was identified according to the percentage of cells staining for PD-L1 TC3 or IC3 10 TC2 or IC2 5 TC1 or IC1 1 and TC0 or IC0 1.BIRCH trial first line cohort 1 second line cohort 2 and third line or higher cohort 3.

The phase 2 KEYNOTE-021 trial tested the first-line combina- tion of pembrolizumab with carboplatinpemetrexed and demon- strated a promising activity with an ORR of 55 in the combinatorial arm versus 29 in chemotherapy arm .In the case of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab devel- opment PD-L1 expression detection antibody SP142 assay was evaluated on both tumor TC and tumor-infiltrating immune cells IC and a different score was identified accord- ing to the percentage of cells staining for PD-L1 TC3 or IC3 10 TC2 or IC2 5 TC1 or IC1 1 and TC0 or IC01.

Therefore the absence of PD-L1 expression on a diagnostic biopsy sample might not exactly mirror the real systemic immunological land- scape of the patient .In addition the use of many detection antibodies targeting different protein epitopes and the variable PD-L1 positivity thresholds applied on heterogeneous cell populations tumor cells tumor-infiltrated immune cells or both complicate further the overall scenario .

The analytic comparison suggested that three PD-L1 IHC assays are aligned with regard to PD-L1 expression on tumor cells with the exception of SP142 while a great variability was observed in the immune cell staining.
