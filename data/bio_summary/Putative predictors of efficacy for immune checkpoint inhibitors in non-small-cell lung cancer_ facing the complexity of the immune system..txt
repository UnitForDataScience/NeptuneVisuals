in the pivotal keynote-001 trial in patients with advanced nsclc pembrolizumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and demon- strated an antitumor activity related to the pd-l1 status indeed the orr in patients with a pd-l1 expression 50 was statistically higher 45.2 than in patients with an expression range 1-49 16.5 and 1 10.7 .

nov 275157528563-567. the first evidence supporting that across multiple cancer types responses to atezolizumab were observed in patients with tumors expressing high levels of pd-l1 especially when pd-l1 was expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells.keir me butte mj freeman gj et al.

two-year os rates were 25 33 27 and 62 respectively 24-week pfs rates were 51 71 38 and 51 respectively.checkmate 026 the primary end point was pfs assessed among patients with a pd-l1 expression level of 5 or more.keynote-010 os was significantly longer for pembrolizumab 2 mgkg versus docetaxel hazard ratio hr 0.71 95 confidence interval ci 0.58-0.88 p  0.0008 and for pembrolizumab 10 mgkg versus docetaxel 0.61 0.49-0.75 p  0.0001. median pfs was 3.9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mgkg 4.0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mgkg and 4.0 months with docetaxel with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg kg versus docetaxel 0.88 0.74-1.05 p  0.07 or for pembrolizumab 10 mgkg versus docetaxel hr 0.79 95 ci 0.66-0.94 p  0.004.in the case of the anti-pd-l1 antibody atezolizumab development pd-l1 expression detection antibody sp142 assay was evaluated on both tumor tc and tumor-infiltrating immune cells ic and a different score was identified according to the percentage of cells staining for pd-l1 tc3 or ic3 10 tc2 or ic2 5 tc1 or ic1 1 and tc0 or ic0 1.birch trial first line cohort 1 second line cohort 2 and third line or higher cohort 3. median os cohort 1 was 23.5 months 26.9 months for tc3 or ic3 patients cohorts 2 and 3 were 15.5 and 13.2 months respectively.

another recent network meta-analysis considering only studies in nsclc reported in pd-l1-negative patients an orr of 13 increasing concurrently to pd-l1 expression .limitations of pd-l1 as a predictive biomarkerthe role of pd-l1 as a predictive biomarker for immunother- apy is strongly limited by the evidence that also patients affected by pd-l1-negative tumors might respond to the pd-1pd-l1 blockade .

moreover some pd-l1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in plasma dna of nsclc patients treated with nivolumab such as rs2282055and rs4143815 have been associated with an improved clin- ical benefit .in conclusion although the expression of pd-l1 in tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been related with clinical benefit from immune checkpoint blockade  the lack of an absolute and exclusive correlation between pd-l1 expression and response demonstrates that this biomarker might not be considered sufficient alone to explain the rates of durable responses observed in patients with various cancer types .mutational load mutation-associated neoantigens and other genomic eventsamong the current candidate biomarkers for immunotherapy the study of the mutational load and the related mutation- associated neoantigens mana appears to be a promising field for deeper investigations.

a meta-analysis including 29 studies and 8600 lung cancer patients indicated that a high level of cd8 and cd3 cells infiltration in tumor stroma and tumor nest group of malignant cells interspersed within the stroma is associated with an improved os in lung cancer patients .

jul 093732123-135. this phase 3 trial demonstrated the overall survival benefit of nivolumab versus docetaxel in patients with advanced pre- viously treated squamous nsclc regardless of pd-l1 expres- sion level.reck m rodriguez-abreu d robinson ag et al.

nov 10375191823-1833. this phase 3 trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab is asso- ciated with longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than first-line platinum-based che- motherapy in patients with advanced nsclc and pd-l1 expression on at least 50 of tumor cells.rittmeyer a barlesi f waterkamp d et al.

may 21372 212018-2028.in this pivotal keynote-001 trial in patients with advanced nsclc pembrolizumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and demonstrated an antitumor activity related to the pd-l1 status.herbst rs soria jc kowanetz m et al.

atezolizumab was associated with a significant os benefit in the overall population with a major advantage in patients with a high or medium expression of pd-l1 tc3 or ic3 hr 0.49 p  0.068 tc 23 or ic 23 hr 0.54 p  0.014 or any pd-l1 expression tc or ic 123 hr 0.59 p  0.005 compared to pd-l1-nega- tive patients hr 1.04 p  0.871 .

this study reported a significant interaction p  0.0001 according to tumor pd-l1 expression in the overall sample with an orr of 34.1 in the pd-figure 1. correlation between pd-l1 expression and overall survival benefit in patients with nsclc treated with the currently investigated pd-1pd-l1 inhibitors.the association between pd-l1 expression and overall survival os rate at 12 months is reported.

finally the variability of the patients' t- cell repertoire might affect the activity of immunotherapy through the immune tolerance process occurring when a mana mimics a self-antigen therefore the self and non-self discrimination represents a crucial factor in the balance between sensitivity and resistance .other genomic alterations3.2.1 oncogenesfrom the available data deriving from randomized clinical trials the presence of crucial molecular alterations in lung cancer oncogenes such as egfr mutations seems to be asso- ciated with a reduced benefit from immunotherapy compared to wild-type patients .

a pre- liminary analysis in advanced lung cancer patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy suggested that patients pre- viously exposed to the enterococcus hirae and barnesiella intes- tinihominis exhibited longer pfs .

oct 22373171627-1639. this phase 3 trial demonstrated the overall survival benefit of the anti-pd-1 antibody nivolumab versus docetaxel in advanced non-squamous nsclc patients who progressed dur- ing or after platinum-based chemotherapy.brahmer j reckamp kl baas p et al.

nov17 111497-1508.in this randomized phase 2 trial the combination of pembro- lizumab carboplatin and pemetrexed resulted to be an effec- tive and tolerable first-line treatment option for patients with advanced non-squamous nsclc.gordon ms herbst rs horn l et al.
