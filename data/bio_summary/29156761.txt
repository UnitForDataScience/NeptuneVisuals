Probiotics play many important roles in maintaining the intestinal health such as makingFigure 9 Polysaccharides extracted from H. erinaceus showed a good prebiotic effect on TNBS-induced mice.Figure 10 Effect of AE on the TNF-a- and LPS-induced Caco-2 cells A CD4CD25Treg cells in TNBS-induced IBD rats induced by TNBS enema B relative abundance of B. friagilis differently treated IBD rats C and the relative content of fatty acids in AE from H. erinaceus analysis by GC-MS D.Figure 11 Active ingredients and mode of action of H. erinaceus for IBD prevention and treatment.Table 1 Experimental design of extracts effects in TNBS-induced IBD ratsTable 2 Experimental design of prebiotic effect of polysaccharides from H. erinaceus extracts in TNBS-induced miceNotes Antibiotics ampicillin 2 gL vancomycin 1.0 gL neomycin 2 gL and metronidazole 2 gL Bifidobacterium.was 109 CFU.intestinal mucous membrane surface forming biological barrier constituting intestinal engraftment resistance to prevent bacterial pathogens invading conditionally pathogenic bacteria avoiding the occurrence of diseases and safeguarding the intestinal normal metabolism 43- 47.

In this study the TNBS could significantly reduce the OTUs of the gut microbiota in rats P  0.05 vs the normal group as shown in Figure 5 while treatment with H. erinaceus extracts recovered the number of OTUs to near normal especially in the AE- treated groups P  0.05 vs the TNBS-induced group P 0.05 vs the normal group and ameliorated the clinical parameters of the IBD rats.

All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used.Effects on TNBS-induced IBD ratsAfter 7 days of adaptation period the animals were randomly divided into five groups six rats in each group and three per cage 100 mgkg  day PE group 100 mgkg  day AE group 100 mgkg  day WE group model group and normal group and more details showed in Table 1.

The gut microbiota structure of the AE-treated group was close to the normal rats while the PE-treated group were close to the model rats and the WE-treated group was neither different from the normal nor the TNBS-induced groupFigure 4 which indicated that the alcoholic extracts AE of H. erinaceus may regulate the gut microbiota to the normal-like structure in the TNBS-induced IBD rats as the main active ingredients of H. erinaceus.Analysis of mechanical contribution to bacterial dynamic balanceMetastats analysis revealed the difference of taxonomic abundance between different groups together with FDR correction as revealed in Figure 5.

The number of CD4CD25Treg cells increased in the peripheral blood of rats after treatment with the H. erinaceus extracts compared with the TNBS-treated group Figure 10B P 0.05 indicating that the H. erinaceus extracts could activate the immune system of IBD.A new study reported that Bacteroides friagilis delivered immunomodulatory molecules to immune cells via secretion of outer membrane vesicles to Treg to suppress the mucosal inflammation in IBD 39 as shown in Figure 10C.

P  0.05 vs the control group P  0.05 P  0.01 vs the model group indicating significant differences compared with the model group.Amelioration of the expression levels of serum cytokinesAfter 14 days of treatment the serum levels of IL- 1a IL-2 IL-8 IL-10 IL-11 IL-12 TNF-g TNF-a VGEFMIP-a and M-CSF were monitored.
