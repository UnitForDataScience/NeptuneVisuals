Probiotics play many important roles in maintaining the intestinal health such as makingFigure 9 Polysaccharides extracted from H. erinaceus showed a good prebiotic effect on TNBS-induced mice.Figure 10 Effect of AE on the TNF-a- and LPS-induced Caco-2 cells A CD4CD25Treg cells in TNBS-induced IBD rats induced by TNBS enema B relative abundance of B. friagilis differently treated IBD rats C and the relative content of fatty acids in AE from H. erinaceus analysis by GC-MS D.Figure 11 Active ingredients and mode of action of H. erinaceus for IBD prevention and treatment.Table 1 Experimental design of extracts effects in TNBS-induced IBD ratsTable 2 Experimental design of prebiotic effect of polysaccharides from H. erinaceus extracts in TNBS-induced miceNotes Antibiotics ampicillin 2 gL vancomycin 1.0 gL neomycin 2 gL and metronidazole 2 gL Bifidobacterium.was 109 CFU.intestinal mucous membrane surface forming biological barrier constituting intestinal engraftment resistance to prevent bacterial pathogens invading conditionally pathogenic bacteria avoiding the occurrence of diseases and safeguarding the intestinal normal metabolism 43- 47.

All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used.Effects on TNBS-induced IBD ratsAfter 7 days of adaptation period the animals were randomly divided into five groups six rats in each group and three per cage 100 mgkg  day PE group 100 mgkg  day AE group 100 mgkg  day WE group model group and normal group and more details showed in Table 1.

Normal group without any treatment model the TNBS-induced group WE the whole extract-treated group after TNBS induction PE the polysaccharides extract-treated group after TNBS induction AE the alcohol extracts-treated group after TNBS induction.

The gut microbiota structure of the AE-treated group was close to the normal rats while the PE-treated group were close to the model rats and the WE-treated group was neither different from the normal nor the TNBS-induced groupFigure 4 which indicated that the alcoholic extracts AE of H. erinaceus may regulate the gut microbiota to the normal-like structure in the TNBS-induced IBD rats as the main active ingredients of H. erinaceus.Analysis of mechanical contribution to bacterial dynamic balanceMetastats analysis revealed the difference of taxonomic abundance between different groups together with FDR correction as revealed in Figure 5.

In this study the TNBS could significantly reduce the OTUs of the gut microbiota in rats P  0.05 vs the normal group as shown in Figure 5 while treatment with H. erinaceus extracts recovered the number of OTUs to near normal especially in the AE- treated groups P  0.05 vs the TNBS-induced group P 0.05 vs the normal group and ameliorated the clinical parameters of the IBD rats.

Hematoxylin and eosin HE-stained sections showed mucosal erosions and ulceration in the TNBS-induced group Figure 1 model group compared with the normal group Figure 1 normal group.

The number of CD4CD25Treg cells increased in the peripheral blood of rats after treatment with the H. erinaceus extracts compared with the TNBS-treated group Figure 10B P 0.05 indicating that the H. erinaceus extracts could activate the immune system of IBD.A new study reported that Bacteroides friagilis delivered immunomodulatory molecules to immune cells via secretion of outer membrane vesicles to Treg to suppress the mucosal inflammation in IBD 39 as shown in Figure 10C.

Rats in the normal and model groups were induced by TNBS WE the whole extract-treated group after TNBS induction PE the polysaccharides extract-treated group after TNBS induction AE the alcohol extract-treated group after TNBS induction.

Rats in the normal without nothing treatment and model groups were induced by TNBS WE the whole extract-treated group after TNBS induction PE the polysaccharides extract-treated group after TNBS induction AE the alcohol extract-treated group after TNBS induction.DISCUSSIONMushrooms are generally a good source of nutrients and health-promoting compounds.

Taken together we demonstrated that H. erinaceus extracts could promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and improve the host immunity in vivo IBD model which shows clinical potential in relieving IBD by regulating gut microbiota and immune system.INTRODUCTIONInflammatory bowel diseases IBDs including ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn's disease arecharacterized by recurring symptoms of abdominal pain diarrhea pus and bleeding 1.
