In addition Haverkate et al found that the median time to spontaneous decolonization of ARB in intensive care unit patients was 4.8 months 21 and patients hospitalizedin long-term acute-care hospitals needed a median of 205 days and 270 days between readmissions to get rid of colonizing ARB strains 22.

These findings were confirmed by Oren et al who revealed that only 7 of patients on a hematology ward became decolonized from CPE after a median of 140 days 26.Also there have been attempts to decolonize patients using targeted antibiotics.

The reported results are in line with recent observations by Millan et al who reported that FMT used to treat recurrent C. difficile infection reduces the load of antibiotic-resistant genes in the gut of patients heavily pretreated with antibiotics 34.Another positive aspect of the FMTs was the durability of the response that is recolonization with the same ARB occurred in only 315 20 patients see Supplementary Materials.

In a population that included patients with blood disorders Zimmerman et al reported that a longer time mean 387 days was required to obtain negative rectal swab cultures from individuals who were originally colonized with CPE 25.

In a study by O'Fallon et al the median duration of colonization with mul- tidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli was 144 days 20.
