Furthermore the development of CDI is favoured because microbiota changes are associated with unbalanced immune responses after antibiotic treatment.While mechanisms through which gut microbiota influences C. difficile are being partially elucidated not much is known about the possible effect of C. difficile on gut microbiota.

Another recent study demon- strated that epidemic C. difficile isolates successfully compete for nutrients even in the presence of a complex gut microbiota.It is very likely that C. difficile overgrowth in the gut niche affects the reconstitution of gut microbiota dur- ing and after the CDI.

To address the possible impact of C. difficile on the growth of common gut bacteria we analyzed the differences in bacterial community structure of fecal microbiota after in vitro growth in C. dif- ficile conditioned medium.

Black lines separate two C. difficile ribotypes whereas colored lines indicate different C. difficile strains.Figure 4.

Within C. difficile samples further clustering was associated with fecal microbiota type healthy or post-antibiotic and further with C. difficile ribotype.

In the present study we have mimicked the conditions of a C. difficile influenced environment by comparing fecal microbiota community structure after cultivation in C. difficile con- ditioned and fresh growth medium.Possible mechanisms of interactions between pathobionts and gut microbiota include nutrient depletion direct inhibition and effect via immune defenses.

In co-culture of C. difficile and selected bacterial species no direct inhibition was detected except for R. gnavus while all tested strains showed various degrees of growth decrease in C. difficile conditioned medium Fig.

To test whether changes in microbiota grown in C. difficile conditioned medium are specific we compared two different types of pooled fecal microbiota pre- and post-antibiotics after cultivation in C. difficile conditioned medium with conditioned media of other bacteria.

The specific nature of changes was to some extent confirmed also in gnotobiotic mouse model with simplified 12 species murine microbiota Oligo-MM where colonization with C. difficile but not with C. scindens resulted in significant compositional perturbation as compared to uninfected control animals.

The most prominently influenced OTUs have well defined roles within gut microbiota functions andor have been previously associated with presence or absence of C. difficile Dorea Enterococcus ClostridiumXIVa Veillonella EscherichiaShigella and Lactobacillus.The microbiota in C. difficile conditioned medium generally contained significantly over-represented oppor- tunistic pathogens particularly Enterococcus members.
