conse- quently the specific bam-degradation rate mg bammsh1-gfp cellmin of msh1-gfp was higher in the presence of the sfc compared to msh1-gfp alone 3- and 2-fold in systems fed with 1 and 1000 mgl bam respectively.biofilm occupation and bam-degradation activity of strain msh1-gfp in the presence of an sfc invasion modein the invasion approach the sfc was allowed to colonize the flow channel for 20 days in advance to msh1-gfp inoculation.

flow channels were inoculated with either the sfc followed by inoculation with msh1-gfp at day 20 panel a or were operated without inoculation of the sfc followed by inoculation with msh1-gfp at day 20 panel b. panel a left shows biofilms of the sfc after 20 days of operation prior to msh1-gfp inoculation.

msh1 was inoculated simultaneously with the sfc co-colonization mode or after the sfc formed a biofilm invasion mode.

when co-colonization was assessed nine flow chan- nels were inoculated with a mixture of sfc and msh1-gfp 2 x 107 cells eachchannel nine flow channels with the sfc 2 x 107 cellschannel and nine flow channels with msh1-gfp 2 x 107 cellschannel.

clsm analysis of control channels inoculated with the sfc only showed that the sfc formed a biofilm covering the entire surface of the flow channel when irrigated with 1000 mgl bam while when fed with 1 mgl bam and no bam only small microcolonies developed figure .

a plausible expla- nation of this unexpected higher sfc biomass in flow channels irrigated with 1000 mgl bam is growth of the sfc on organic car- bon impurities in the bam solution purity of used bam was 95 that will increase in content with increasing bam concentration.

in systems inoculated with msh1-gfp combined with the sfc only msh1-gfp cells expressing gfp were accounted as msh1-gfp cells since we could not discriminate between sfc cells and msh1-gfp cells not expressing gfp.

in channels fed with no bam and 1 mgl bam the sfc and msh1-gfp formed separated microcolonies and overallthe biofilm morphology resembled this of biofilms that de- veloped in channels inoculated with the sfc alone.

no biofilm formation was observed in non-inoculated flow channels.table 1. overall biofilm biomass msh1-gfp abundances and overall and specific bam-degradation rates in flow channels that were operated either according to the co-colonization mode msh1-gfp inoculated simultaneously with the sfc or according to the invasion mode msh1-gfp inoculated in flow channels already occupied by the sfc biofilm.nominal bambamrelativetotalspecific bam-concentrationdegradationbamabundancedabundanceedegradation ratef in feedextentadegradation ratebtotal biomasscmsh1-gfpmsh1-gfpmsh1-gfpinoculummglmg bamminmm3mm2cellsmg bamcellminco-colonization modemsh1-gfp0n.a.n.a.2.30 - 0.76a59 - 9a5.5 - 1.8 x 108an.a.

moreover msh1-gfp grew and performed bam degradation while the sfc was grow- ing since also the number of sfc cells in the biofilm had in- creased 10-fold or more compared to the inoculum at the end of the experiment.
