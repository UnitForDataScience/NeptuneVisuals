Bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsies can be considered if there is a strong indication for evaluating and treating NTM.Role of bronchoscopy in noninfectious causes in CFAlthough there were studies to show the usefulness of bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsies help to understand airway remodeling and to decelerate the progressive airway damage in children hemoptysis has been noted more frequently in older CF patients with progressive lung disease associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Burkholderia cepacia and Staphylococcus aureus along with persistent airway inflammation and angiogenesis of bronchial arteries which are bordering to the airways 32-34.Endobronchial biopsies have been useful in understanding airway remodeling and inflammatory changes in early CF disease including in those who are asymptomatic 33.

Increased airway smooth muscle mass in children with asthma cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

Other changes noted include increase in airway smooth muscle cells which could play a role in airway hyper-responsiveness and destruction with fibrotic changes to cartilage which can lead to tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia seen in advanced CF disease 34-38.
