These may contribute to oral vaccine failure but biomarkers of enteropathy have not shown consistent associations with oral vaccine immunogenicity.Malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies occur in populations where oral vaccine immunogenicity is diminished but measures of malnutrition and growth of infants do not appear to be directly associated with immunogenicity.Pre-vaccination exposure to the pathogen or the size of the infectious challenge dose post vaccination may limit vaccine effectiveness in low-income countries but evidence in support of this hypothesis is limited.InterventionsInsights from studies of the mechanisms responsible for poor oral vaccine immunogenicity have so far failed to yield effective interventions to improve immunogenicity or better-designed vaccines.Increases in the number of doses of vaccine given have in some cases led to improvements in immunogenicity and efficacy e.g.

Other oral vaccines arein development including those against Shigella enterotoxigenic E. coli Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile as well as several novel rotavirus vaccine candidates including the human neonatal vaccine RV3-BB 5 and an oral bovine pentavalent vaccine 6.Yet oral vaccines have an Achilles' heel - their immunogenicity and efficacy is impaired in low-income countries that experience the greatest burden of enteric disease Box 1.

oral poliovirus vaccine.Withholding breastfeeding has not significantly improved the immunogenicity of oral poliovirus rotavirus or cholera vaccines.Treatment of enteropathy and supplementation with micronutrients or probiotics have not consistently resulted in improvements in oral vaccine immunogenicity.ConclusionOral vaccines are among the more cost-effective health interventions but their impact is not fully realized because of diminished immunogenicity and efficacy in the populations that need them most.We remain uncertain about the mechanisms responsible for diminished immunogenicity although new studies and technologies are providing unprecedented insights.

Oral vaccine failure a timeline of contributing factors.EED Environmental enteric dysfunction HBGA Histo blood group antigen HMO Human milk oligosaccharide.inactivated oral cholera vaccines have found lower immunogenicity and efficacy among young children 5 years of age compared with older children 31-34.In each of these examples deficits in oral vaccine performance have been observed within the context of trials in which the potency and cold-chain requirements of the administered vaccines were carefully maintained.

What then explains the discrepancies in oral vaccine outcomes between high-income and low-income settings In this review we consider the biological mechanisms that might account for the geographic variation in oral vaccine performance.

However breastfeeding may also prevent enteric infections 71 promote the maturation of the infant immune system 72 and buffer vaccine viruses from gastric acid 67 which together may alleviate or indeed reverse the inhibitory effects of breast milk IgA.Genetic risk factorsAlthough unable to account for seasonal fluctuations in oral vaccine response a role for genetic variation in shaping the immune response to oral vaccines is supported by a study of 207 twin pairs in the Gambia who received multiple doses of OPV 73.

These factors may have a greater impact on oral vaccine performance than malnutrition itself although teasing apart such effects is likely to prove challenging see below.Environmental exposuresEnteric infectionsEnteric infections have long been recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality among young infants and this burden is greatest in the developing countries where oral vaccines are least immunogenic 2124.

Thus the negative repercussions of enterovirus exposure for oral vaccines may extend beyond OPV.Given that OPV and oral rotavirus vaccines are regularly co-administered as part of routine immunization programs the potential interference between these attenuated viruses has garnered considerable interest.

Thus a consistent link between microbiota composition and oral vaccine performance has not yet been identified and there is limited evidence to suggest that vaccine failure is associated with overt perturbations in the microbiota or 'dysbiosis'.In addition to observational studies of microbiota composition several trials have examined whether augmenting the infant microbiota with probiotic supplements has the capacity to improve oral vaccine outcomes.

As our understanding of the infant microbiota develops microbiota-directed therapies may offer novel ways of boosting oral vaccine efficacy.Additional studies exploring the relationship between commensal bacteria and oral vaccine response are likely to accumulate swiftly over the coming years.
