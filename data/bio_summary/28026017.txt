they are included in processed food to improve their durability andor organoleptic properties5 and are also employed in the for- mulation of dietary supplements.6 as the metabolism of polyphe- nols is currently being clarified rather than the study of their chemical composition the study of the bioaccessibility7 and fur- ther bioavailability of a certain phenolic preparation is becom- ing more important since the biological activity attributed topolyphenols is principally due to the phenolic metabolites formed in the human body - mainly by the action of the gut micro- biota - rather than the original forms present in the preparation.8 indeed human intervention studies provide the best models for studying polyphenol metabolism and bioavailability although in vivo intervention trials have inevitable practical economic and ethical limitations.

this is in agreement with other authors who reported a fraction of non-extractable polyphenols associated with pomace dietary fibre.25metabolism of gp polyphenols by human faecal microbiota to assess the bioaccessibility7 of the gp polyphenols - understanding it as such the amount of phenolic compounds released from matrix and thereby made potentially available for the intestinal absorption - as well as their microbial metabolismj sci food agric 2017 97 3433 - 3444c 2016 society of chemical industrywileyonlinelibrary.comjsfaa battery of different phenolic metabolites were targeted during fermentation of the extracts with faecal microbiota.

a total of 16 phenolic compounds corresponding to benzoic phenylacetic phenylpropionic and cinnamic acids and other metabolites could be quantified figs 2 -5 in the fermented samples.in general incubation of the gp extracts with faecal micro- biota from the two volunteers 1 and 2 led to gentle increases in the concentration of phenolic metabolites during fermenta- tion in comparison to the incubation of the faecal microbiota on their own.

most of the phenolic metabolites detected have also been identified in fermentations with faecal microbiota of extracts from grape seeds2930 and wine.31to summarize the changes in the concentration of phenolic metabolites resulting from in vitro fermentation of the gp extracts two principal component analyses pca was performed.
