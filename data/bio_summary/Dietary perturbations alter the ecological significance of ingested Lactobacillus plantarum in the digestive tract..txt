Lactobacillus species-specific real-time PCR primers used in the study.Lactobacillus plantarum cluster includes L. plantarum Lactobacillus fabifermentans Lactobacillus paraplantarumand Lactobacillus pentosus.Lactobacillus species-specific quantitative PCR.Genomic DNA of L. plantarum WCFS1-R Lactobacillus murinus ASF 361 Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272 and Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 19992 were extracted using the DNeasy Blood  Tissue Kit Qiagen Inc. Valencia CA USA quantified with the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit Life Technologies Carlsbad CA USA.

However it remains to be determined the extent to which diet-associated intestinal behaviors of ingested and indigenous Lactobacillus species are reversible and whether transient Lactobacillus populations are integrated within the indigenous microbiome.In this study we hypothesized that the open ecological niche created for ingested L. plantarum by a HFHSD is reversible and that L. plantarum interactions with the intestinal microbiome are diet dependent.

Black dashes indicate the days when the mice received L. plantarum WCFS1-R.ResultsHFHSD consistently increases the survival and persistence of L. plantarum in the GI tract.

Viable L. plantarum was recovered in similar numbers from all stools 3 and 5 h after the first admin- istration of L. plantarum WCFS1-R during each of the dietary periods Supplementary Fig.

Opposite to L. plantarum WCFS1-R the levels of indigenous Lactobacillus species encompassing all OTUs assigned to that genus except for L. plantarum were lowest during HFHSD con- sumption and increased with the LFPPD Fig.

Instead when L. plantarum was given to the animals during the two HFHSD periods L. plantarum constituted a higher percentage of the total Lactobacillus population 41.9 and 55.9 for HFHSD1 and HFHSD2 respectively than during the LFPPD 1.4 Fig.

Black dashes indicate the days when the mice received L. plantarum WCFS1-R.BLAST searches of the prominent Lactobacillus OTUs present in the mouse stools identified L. plantarum as well as other taxa highly related to L. murinus L. reuteri and L. gasseri and here referred to as species clusters Supplementary Fig.

Although L. plantarum WCFS1-R is able to consume sucrose it is unlikely that sucrose utilization conferred a nutritional advantage to L. plantarum becauseFigure 7.

Although we did not find such a relationship between L. plantarum and the indigenous lactobacilli the quantities of L. plantarum were strongly and positively correlated with other members of the Firmicutes phylum including other lactic acid bacteria such as Streptococcus Fig.

Therefore ROS-tolerant L. plantarum WCFS1-R might have benefited in the HFHSD background by gaining access to oth- erwise limited resources previously utilized by indigenous lactobacilli.Beyond the compensatory changes to Lactobacillus numbers ingestion of L. plantarum WCFS1-R appears to have also exerted independent effects on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.
