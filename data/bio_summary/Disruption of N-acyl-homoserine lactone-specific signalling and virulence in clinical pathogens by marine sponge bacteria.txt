strains B98C39 B98SK51b B98SK53b B98SK52 and B98SM8 fivePseudoalteromonas sp strains J10 JC29 W3 W11 and W21 and one Psychrobacter sp.

S4B.With respect to the disruption of preformed biofilms 13 of the 18 QSI marine strains all Bacillus sp all Pseu- domonas sp.

B98C566 Pseudoalteromonas sp J10 and JC29 and Paracoccus sp.

This study describes for the first time a marine sponge Psychrobacter sp.

isolate B98C22 that blocks QS signalling while also reporting dual QS QSI activity in the Pseudoalteromonas sp.

In this work we have described for the first time the marine sponge Psychrobacter sp.

B98C22 with QSI activity and interestingly another two marine sponge isolates which showed dual QSQSI activity Pseudoalteromonas sp.

J10 and Paracoccus sp.

QSI isolates were identified as belongingprimarily to the Gram-negative Gammaproteobacteria class five Pseudomonas sp.

In addition one strain belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria class Paracoccus sp.
