this study describes for the first time a marine sponge psychrobacter sp.

isolate b98c22 that blocks qs signalling while also reporting dual qs qsi activity in the pseudoalteromonas sp.

in this work we have described for the first time the marine sponge psychrobacter sp.

b98c22 with qsi activity and interestingly another two marine sponge isolates which showed dual qsqsi activity pseudoalteromonas sp.

j10 and paracoccus sp.

1. qsi isolates were identified as belongingprimarily to the gram-negative gammaproteobacteria class five pseudomonas sp.

in addition one strain belonging to the alphaproteobacteria class paracoccus sp.

fur- thermore gram-positive qsi candidates belonging to the phylum firmicutes were also identified five bacillus sp.
