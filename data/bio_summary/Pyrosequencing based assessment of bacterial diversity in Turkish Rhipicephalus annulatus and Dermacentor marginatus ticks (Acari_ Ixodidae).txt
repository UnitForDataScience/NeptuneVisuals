marginatus 9 and 10 specimens had consistent re- sults two of four ticks representing Sivas province isolat- ed D. marginatus samples 11 and 12 accounted for most of the abundances of the pathogen bacterial taxa.Although R. annulatus had greater occurrence of pathogen genera these numbers are relatively low compared to non-pathogenic or endosymbiotic bacteria same was true for samples 9 and 10 of D. marginatus species.

marginatus ticks both in this study and our very recent investigation this species might contributed to rickettsiosis cases reported in Turkey Keskin et al.

marginatus is characterized as thermophylic tick ecologi- cally favoring areas under Oak and Pine vegetation in Europe and in Amasya and Tokat provinces in Turkey where numer- ous D. marginatus ticks isolated from humans especially in the Spring and Fall Estrada-Pena et al.

While feeding on the host ticks cause problems like skin irritation and anemia in addition to serious health problems as vectors of many bacterial pathogens pro- tozoan parasites and viruses Estrada-Pena and Jongejan  Sonenshine and Roe .There are more than 900 tick species in the world with 47 of them present in Turkey Bursali et al.

The most distinguishable dif- ference between the two species of ticks is the lack of Rickettsia genus in R. annulatus compared to D. marginatus where these pleomorphic bacteria compose approximately 60 of total abun- dance.

Diversity analysis showed that similarity measure based on species proportions such as thetan coefficient may be more adequate for measuring the similarity of two populations as explained by Yue and Clayton .Multi-response permutation procedures MRPPMRPP analysis of the two tick species using Sorensen Bray- Curtis distance measure indicated significant difference among bacterial taxa p  0.05.

The un-weighted version of same analysis obtained p value of0.454 which signified that the community structure in samples was not different from randomly generated trees once se- quence abundance was not taken into account.Beta-diversity statisticsWhile community membership presence and absence deter- mined using jclas coefficient indicated non-significant differ- ence between the two ticks similarity in abundance-based community structure determined using thetan coefficient indi- cated significantly different p  0.029 bacterial community associated with two tick species.

annulatus is one of the most significant bovine infectious species and plays an important role as a vector of many path- ogens causing growth obstruction and death of the infected animals Estrada-Pena et al.
