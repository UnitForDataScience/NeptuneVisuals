This paper summarizes the main messages and conclusions of the presentations and following discussions and advocates to take actions and integrate the topic drug-nutrition interactions in scientific research programs and in clini- cal practice.Clinical assessment of interactions of drugs with nutrients an urgent unmet needWhereas drug-drug interactions are widely recognized as clinically relevant and are included in most phar- macovigilance systems nutrient-drug interactions are underexplored and their assessment is not part of the clinical routine.

An integrated nutritional intervention including the targeting of vitamin D and K deficiencies may eventually turn out to be the most fruitful approach to retard vascular calcification and improve cardiovascular prognosis in high-risk patients.Omega-3 benefitsPreviously conventional research in nutrition has focused on dietary intake of the two marine omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA.

Alsouse of oral antidiabetics vitamin K antagonists diuretics and ACE inhibitors was found to be significantly associ- ated with lower vitamin D levels .

Furthermore a dose-response study on red blood cell RBC folate during pregnancy was conducted RBC folate levels of 906 nmolL 400 ngmL were identified as providing the greatest protection from NTD however insufficient data was available to calculate the risk reduction for levels 1292 nmolL.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of oral contraceptive use on plasma and RBC folate concentrations showed that independently of OC use almost all studies reported much lower mean RBC folate values than the protective cut-off levels.

According to some hypotheses OC may inter- fere with the absorption of pteroylpolyglutamates or might cause malabsorption of dietary folate by inhibition of jeju- nal folate conjugase however this was not confirmed by in vitro studies.

A possible mechanism for increased folate excretion would be a change in serum binding pro- teins for folate.

In an RCT women received OC with folate or l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate l-5-MTHF for 24 weeks and OC alone for an additional 20 weeks folate elimination phase.

An OC fortified with folate or l-5-MTHF for 6 months lead to a significant increase and maintenance in folate status in women of reproductive age  .
