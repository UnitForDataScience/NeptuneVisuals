When applied to A. baumannii these approaches provided valuable information on both the pre- sent A. baumannii population structure and the mechanisms of acquisition and evolution of antimicrobial resistance     .

For details see supplementary table S2 Supplementary Material online and the A. baumannii MLST Databases website  .Antimicrobial Susceptibility TestingThe general antimicrobial susceptibility of A. baumannii strains DSM30011 ATCC17978 and ATCC19606 was evaluated using the VITEK 2 System bioMe'rieux following the criteria recommended by the CLSI Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2016 Performance standards for antimicrobial sus- ceptibility testing.

S1B Supplementary Material online in what represents a typical phenotype asso- ciated to A. baumannii but not to other Acinetobacter mem- bers  .DSM30011 thus provided us with an A. baumannii strain originally isolated in the USA from a resinous desert plant70 years ago that is on the verge of the massive introduc- tion of antibiotic therapy to treat infections .

Blasting the 243 CDS against a larger database containing5000 complete genomes from Archaea and major bacterial phyla including 43 A. baumannii proteomes revealed 89 CDS with significant best hits in A. baumannii 52 CDS were affiliated with other gammaproteobacteria 20 with other bacterial phyla 69 e value  1 x e-4 provided no sig- nificant hits false positives and 13 showed no hits at all sup- plementary table S4 Supplementary Material online.

The presence of these two genes in the chromosome of this environmental strain reinforces proposals that both provided for the intrinsic b-lactamase gene repertoire of A. baumannii     .DSM30011 also contains a carO variant IV homolog DSM3001104565 described only in A. baumannii  andanoprDoccAB1homolog DSM3001117845 two genes encoding outer membrane OM proteins proposed to participate in the permeation of carbapenems into the periplasm a.

In addition seven other catabolic loci present in DSM30011 were not identified in A. baylyi including three eut pen and tau assigned to the use of ethanolamine penicillin and taurine respectively in other A. baumannii strains  .

This biofilm- associated OM protein has been shown to participate in biofilm maturation on different abiotic surfaces and in adherence to eukaryotic cells in some A. baumannii strainsTable 4Presence in DSM30011 of Virulence and Environmental Persistence Factors Proposed for A. baumannii .

Therefore the conspicuous absence of cpaA in DSM30011  and in the A. baumannii strains ATCC 17978 and ATCC 19606 isolated by the middle of last century supplementary table S1 Supplementary Material online supports proposals that this gene was recently acquired by A. baumannii in the clinical setting as the result of horizontal gene transfer events .FIG.

In turn it opens the possibility that certain phytophagous insects feeding in these plants    represent vectors for the dissem- ination of A. baumannii in the environment.Further studies on other A. baumannii strains of non-clin- ical origin are certainly required to elucidate the processes that led to the recent evolution of this species toward an oppor- tunistic pathogen of humans.AcknowledgmentsWe thank X.
