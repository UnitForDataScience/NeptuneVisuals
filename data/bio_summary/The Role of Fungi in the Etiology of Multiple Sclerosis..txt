This requires dendritic cell presentation of antigens through HLA-D molecules which will be biased toward antigensbest recognized by naive CD4 T cellsVariations in VDJ genes and recombination during production ofCD4 follicular helper T cell antigen recognitionRelative concentration of commensal microbe antigens in lymph node where EBV-positive naive B cells matureAffinity maturation requires CD4 follicular helper T cell recognition of a portion of the antigen endocytosedby the B cell through its BCR and presented through HLA-D molecules.

For example antibacterialantifungal drugs will dramatically increase and then decrease antigens in lymph nodes due to the massive initial die- off of targeted microbes followed by a suppression of the targeted microbial populationTotal number of EBV infected B cells CD8 cytotoxic T cell control of the EBV infected B cellpopulation determines how often a naive B cell matures into a memory B cell while EBV infectedLower EBV loads result in fewer chances of producing a memory B cell which recognizes a forbidden antigen present in the central nervous system in turn reducing MS risk.

This process requires a memory B cell to encounter similar epitopes three times first in the mouth where the memory B cell originates then anywhere in the body where the memory B cell clonally expands and finally in the CNS where the memory B cell recognizes a forbidden antigen and induces MS-causing inflammation.

EBV virions are then produced in these plasma cells from which they can infect other hosts and maintain a stable EBV-positive memory B cell population in the same host .Under EBV-free circumstances a resting naive B cell only activates and goes through affinity maturation if its B cell recep- tor BCR has a decent affinity to an abundant antigen and if it receives CD4 T cell help for a peptide present in this antigen .

Note that an EBV-positive B cell that recognizes a forbidden antigen cannot do much harm immediately after leaving the germinal center as long as a B cell remains EBV infected CD8 cytotoxic T cell control will prevent it from secreting antibodies or clonally expanding.

Their protein portion can be recognized by CD4 T cells giving memory B cells the CD4T cell help necessary to differentiate into a plasma cell in the mouth and shed EBV virions.Forbidden Memory B Cell divides and Becomes eBV-FreeAfter completing affinity maturation the EBV-infected memory B cell recirculates in peripheral blood and in the lymphatic sys- tem .

They thus play a key role in determining which antigens induce a T cell mediatedimmune response as well as which antigens warrant naive B cell maturation into memory B cells.The HLA-DRB115 allele group is an important risk factor in many other inflammatory conditions some of which are sus- pected of having a fungal etiology .

Several studies have linked idiopathic uveitis with fungal infections .As first proposed for ABPA  the HLA-DRB115 allele group appears to increase immune sensitivity to fungi this likely protects the host from certain infections while sometimes caus- ing chronic inflammation due to exposure to usually benign fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus.Antibodies against mannan target mannose polymers covalently bound to fungal cell wall proteins see mannoproteins in  mannan is a minor component ofmycobacteria cell walls but is absent from other types of bacteria.

Antibodies against beta-glucan target the cell wall of fungi  beta-glucan is also present in the cell wall of some types of bacteria.antiBodies aGainst FUnGiHLA-DRB115 increases the risk of various conditions either causedorsuspectedofbeingcausedbyexposuretofungi.

This suggests infectious agents inside the CNS may be contributing to inflammation in MS or alternatively that human cell debris elicit MMR expression.Mannose-binding lectin MBL is an innate immune defense protein synthesized in the liver which binds to terminal man- nose N-acetylglucosamine and fucose on microbial cell walls  and initiates the lectin complement pathway by activating mannose-binding protein-associated serine protease 2 MASP-2 .
