This may explain why a reduction in gut fungi affects inflammation elsewhere in the bodyLymph nodesResting naive B cells whose BCR loosely recognizes fungal antigens endocytose them present fungal peptides to CD4 T cellsMaturing B cells whose BCR recognizes fungal antigens endocytose them present fungal peptides to CD4 follicular helper T cellsCNSMemory B cells whose BCR has high affinity to a fungal epitope endocytose cognate antigens present peptides to CD4 T cellsCD4 T cell recognition of fungal peptide allows naive B cells to activate and become B cell blasts leading to somatic hypermutation and memory B cells with high affinity to fungal antigens.

macrophages and dendritic cells endocytose whole fungi or fungal antigens present fungal peptides to CD4T cellsMemory B cells whose B cell receptor BCR has high affinity to fungal antigens endocytose them present fungal peptides to CD4 T cellsCD4 T cell population that recognizes fungal antigens expands.

Future microbiome and serological studies should consider fungi as a possible risk factor for MS and future clinical studies should consider the effect of fungicides other than DMF on MS symptoms.Keywords multiple sclerosis fungal infections dimethyl fumarate memory B cells epstein-Barr virus HLa- drB115introdUCtionMultiple sclerosis MS is the most common cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults  .

The paucity of studies linking antifungal compounds other than DMF with a reduc- tion in MS symptoms prevents a similar conclusion from being reached for MS if future studies demonstrate the efficacy of many antifungal drugs in MS this would provide strong evidence of a fungal etiology.The effect of oral nystatin on psoriasis is surprising as it is not absorbed  thus cannot reach fungi beyond the gut.

In a mouse model of arthritis stimulated by the injection of bacterial antigens into knee-joints the addition of minute amounts of fungal antigens skewed the T cell immune response toward Th17 cells tripling IL-17 concentration in the joints .Though IL-17 is unambiguously associated with both fungal infections and MS this association only provides weak circum- stantial evidence of a causative link between MS and fungi as IL-17 is also associated with bacterial infections and many idi- opathic inflammatory diseases.

CD4 T cells which readily recognize fungal antigens should increase the probability of this chance event happening such cells are associated with idi- opathic uveitis  though no similar study could be found for MS. Antibodies against Candida species can be used as a proxy for CD4 T cell sensitivity to fungal antigens they are strongly associated with MS risk -.Fungal colonization is thus expected to be an MS risk factor because it allows forbidden memory B cells to clonally expand after shedding their EBV episomes.

Finally HLA- DRB115 and antibodies against a component of the prostate have been linked to granulomatous prostatitis  .Together these studies suggest genital exposure to fungi may play an important etiological role in prostate disease reactive arthritis and MS. Could the unexplained histological evidence of fungal cells in the CNS     and in the prostate   be caused by a fungal infection spreading from the genitals after sexual debut If so loss of immune tolerance to this putative infection could be a plausible cause of prostate disease reactive arthritis uveitis and MS.taBLe 4  Summary of findings linking multiple sclerosis MS to various infection types and recognition of self-antigens.FindingFindingstrengthsuggests contributing microbe is locatedFungiBacteriaVirusesself- antigensFinding strength is based on the number of published studies that strongly support the finding.ConCLUsionVaried molecular and epidemiological evidence supports a role for infections in MS .

While genital Candida exposure may well be an MS risk factor it cannot account for the low incidence of MS in children.Could there Be an as-yet-Unrecognized sexually acquired Fungal infectionTwo diseases have low incidence in children peak incidence in young adults and moderate associations with smoking and HSV- 2 cervical cancer respectively OR  1.8  and OR  1.6and MS respectively OR  1.5  and OR  1.6 .We now know that cervical cancer is not caused by HSV-2 andsmoking--these two risk factors act as surrogates for oncogenic human papilloma virus HPV exposure and their association with cervical cancer disappears after controlling for oncogenic HPV -.Multiple sclerosis' association with young adulthood smoking and HSV-2 seropositivity remains unexplained.

HLA-D molecules which efficiently present bacterial antigens should reduce MS risk whereas HLA-D molecules which efficiently present fungal antigens should increase MS riskA reduction of commensal bacteria e.g.

Genital exposure to an infection involved in MS could solve the puzzling lag between childhood EBV infections and MS onset .The links between various idiopathic inflammatory condi- tions and antibodies against fungi  could be explained by memory B cells accidentally recognizing benign antigens due to the simultaneous presence of EBV virions and fungal antigens near the same lymph node .
