third women's elevated risk of ms  could be explained by higher antibody titers against candida albi- cans measured in healthy women as compared to men suggesting a higher probability of fungal infections in women perhaps due to genital exposure .other ms biomarkers consistent with a fungal etiologymannoproteinsmannoproteins are a ubiquitous component of fungal cell walls composed of protein-bound branched mannose polymers .

in a mouse model of arthritis stimulated by the injection of bacterial antigens into knee-joints the addition of minute amounts of fungal antigens skewed the t cell immune response toward th17 cells tripling il-17 concentration in the joints .though il-17 is unambiguously associated with both fungal infections and ms this association only provides weak circum- stantial evidence of a causative link between ms and fungi as il-17 is also associated with bacterial infections and many idi- opathic inflammatory diseases.

cd4 t cells which readily recognize fungal antigens should increase the probability of this chance event happening such cells are associated with idi- opathic uveitis  though no similar study could be found for ms. antibodies against candida species can be used as a proxy for cd4 t cell sensitivity to fungal antigens they are strongly associated with ms risk -.fungal colonization is thus expected to be an ms risk factor because it allows forbidden memory b cells to clonally expand after shedding their ebv episomes.

for example antibacterialantifungal drugs will dramatically increase and then decrease antigens in lymph nodes due to the massive initial die- off of targeted microbes followed by a suppression of the targeted microbial populationtotal number of ebv infected b cells cd8 cytotoxic t cell control of the ebv infected b cellpopulation determines how often a naive b cell matures into a memory b cell while ebv infectedlower ebv loads result in fewer chances of producing a memory b cell which recognizes a forbidden antigen present in the central nervous system in turn reducing ms risk.

finally hla- drb115 and antibodies against a component of the prostate have been linked to granulomatous prostatitis  .together these studies suggest genital exposure to fungi may play an important etiological role in prostate disease reactive arthritis and ms. could the unexplained histological evidence of fungal cells in the cns     and in the prostate   be caused by a fungal infection spreading from the genitals after sexual debut if so loss of immune tolerance to this putative infection could be a plausible cause of prostate disease reactive arthritis uveitis and ms.table 4  summary of findings linking multiple sclerosis ms to various infection types and recognition of self-antigens.findingfindingstrengthsuggests contributing microbe is locatedfungibacteriavirusesself- antigensfinding strength is based on the number of published studies that strongly support the finding.conclusionvaried molecular and epidemiological evidence supports a role for infections in ms .

future microbiome and serological studies should consider fungi as a possible risk factor for ms and future clinical studies should consider the effect of fungicides other than dmf on ms symptoms.keywords multiple sclerosis fungal infections dimethyl fumarate memory b cells epstein-barr virus hla- drb115introductionmultiple sclerosis ms is the most common cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults  .

the paucity of studies linking antifungal compounds other than dmf with a reduc- tion in ms symptoms prevents a similar conclusion from being reached for ms if future studies demonstrate the efficacy of many antifungal drugs in ms this would provide strong evidence of a fungal etiology.the effect of oral nystatin on psoriasis is surprising as it is not absorbed  thus cannot reach fungi beyond the gut.

while genital candida exposure may well be an ms risk factor it cannot account for the low incidence of ms in children.could there be an as-yet-unrecognized sexually acquired fungal infectiontwo diseases have low incidence in children peak incidence in young adults and moderate associations with smoking and hsv- 2 cervical cancer respectively or  1.8  and or  1.6and ms respectively or  1.5  and or  1.6 .we now know that cervical cancer is not caused by hsv-2 andsmoking--these two risk factors act as surrogates for oncogenic human papilloma virus hpv exposure and their association with cervical cancer disappears after controlling for oncogenic hpv -.multiple sclerosis' association with young adulthood smoking and hsv-2 seropositivity remains unexplained.

a large population of cd4 t cells that recognize fungal peptides increases the probability of naive b cells loosely recognizing fungal antigens maturing into memory b cellsmemory b cell population that recognizes fungal antigens expands.

this random bcr is biased toward either fungal or bacterial antigens and will thus bias affinity maturationvariations in vdj genes and recombination during production of naive b cells in the bone marrow may be genetically biased toward either bacterial or fungal antigens respectively reducing or increasing multiple sclerosis ms risknaive cd4 t cell antigen recognitionaffinity maturation requires naive cd4 t cells to clonally expand and become cd4 follicular helper t cells.

several studies have linked idiopathic uveitis with fungal infections .as first proposed for abpa  the hla-drb115 allele group appears to increase immune sensitivity to fungi this likely protects the host from certain infections while sometimes caus- ing chronic inflammation due to exposure to usually benign fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus.antibodies against mannan target mannose polymers covalently bound to fungal cell wall proteins see mannoproteins in  mannan is a minor component ofmycobacteria cell walls but is absent from other types of bacteria.

to the best of our knowledgeno study has directly measured fungal colonization in relation to ms. the efficacy of the oral fungicide dmf suggests fungal colonization of the gut may be an important contributor to the clonal expansion of forbidden ms-causing memory b cells.forbidden memory b cell recognizes an ms-causing antigen in the cnsas the now large ebv-free forbidden memory b cell population recirculates through the blood and lymphatic system a small fraction of these cells will reach the cns.

this requires dendritic cell presentation of antigens through hla-d molecules which will be biased toward antigensbest recognized by naive cd4 t cellsvariations in vdj genes and recombination during production ofcd4 follicular helper t cell antigen recognitionrelative concentration of commensal microbe antigens in lymph node where ebv-positive naive b cells matureaffinity maturation requires cd4 follicular helper t cell recognition of a portion of the antigen endocytosedby the b cell through its bcr and presented through hla-d molecules.
