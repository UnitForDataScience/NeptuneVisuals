while many parts of the world have made progress in reducing the prevalence of stunting the high burdens in south asia and sub-saharan africa remain where in 2014 25.1 and 32.0 of children under 5 years of age were stunted and there were an estimated 34.3 milliontable 1 definitions and clinical features of malnutritionapemgeneral term describing acute malnutrition resulting from inadequate dietary intake of protein and energy calories it probably has a spectrum of clinical manifestations but is typically classified as marasmus or kwashiorkor severe acute malnutrition see belowacute malnutritionmalnutrition resulting from inadequate food intakeleading to acute loss of body mass with respect to lengthht for age it can be classified as mam or sam it is reversible with adequate nutritional rehabilitationsam kwashiorkorsevere from of malnutrition resulting from poor-qualitydiet and probably other environmental factors children with kwashiorkor have pitting edema in both feet and lower extremities and in severe cases may have total body edema anasarca liver steatosis is common sores develop on the skin and at the corner of the mouth skin is pale and peels flaky-paint dermatosis these children are apathetic and have little appetitesam wasting marasmusacute malnutrition leading to overt loss of subcutaneousadipose tissue and muscle mass the wasted child is thin for hisher ht but not necessarily short children with marasmus have a thin face with wrinkled skin sunken cheeks and large eyes the loss of normal subcutaneous adipose tissue gives the face an old appearance the abdomen may be swollen they have sagging skin on legs and buttocks they are irritable and have increased appetitenot well defined except for clinical marasmus and kwashiorkor see belowwho wfh z scores below median mild z score between -1 and -2 moderate z score between -2 and -3 or muac between 125 mm and 115 mm severe z score of -3 or muac of 115 mmdiagnosis of kwashiorkor does not rely uponanthropometric measures but only on the presence of bilateral pitting edemawho wfh z scores below median severez score of -3 or muac of 115 mmchronic malnutritionstuntingmalnutrition resulting from chronic or recurrentinadequate food intake and possibly chronic systemic inflammation it leads to chronic growth faltering typically evident by short stature for age neurocognitive impairment and metabolic changes associated with chronic adult diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypertension the effects of chronic malnutrition are largely irreversible after 24 mo of agewho hfa z scores below median mild z scorebetween -1 and -2 moderate z score between -2 and -3 severe z score of -3underweightfaltering of linear growth low ht for age wt gain lowwt for age or a combination of both acute on chronic malnutritionmicronutrient deficiencydeficit of essential vitamins and minerals required fornormal physiological function growth and development micronutrient deficiencies may have no overt clinical signs or symptoms unless they are chronic or severecmedian wfab mild grade 1 75-90 wfamoderate grade 2 60-74 wfa severegrade 3 60 wfabased on biochemical measurements with comparison to reference values derived from normal populationsaabbreviations who world health organization mam moderate acute malnutrition sam severe acute malnutrition wfh weight for height hfa height for age wfa weight for age muac mid-upper-arm circumference.bsee reference .csee .and 13.9 million children affected by wasting respectively .

supplemen- tation with selenium along with vitamin a the vitamin b complex vitamin c and vitamin e increased cd3 and cd4 t cell counts but did not augment the antituber- culous t cell response in patients with active tuberculosis  .vitamin a. vitamin a or retinol is acquired exclusively through the diet absorbed by enterocytes and stored in the liver.

the roles of iron zinc selenium vitamin a vitamin c and vitamin d in immune function are discussed below.

this lack of consensus may arise from the variability in vitamin d dosing regimens the variable prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in the study population the failure to achieve or test for an effect on vitamin d levels the use of endpoints that involved self-reported symptoms the inclusion of diverse and unknown etiologies of ari and suboptimal power for subset analyses.

a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a daily oral micronutrient supplement mixture of vitamin a b complex vitamins vitamin c vitamin e and selenium in 887 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis 54 of whom were hiv seropositive showed that the supplement decreased the risk of tuberculosis recurrence median of 43 months of follow-up and marginally reduced mortality in hiv-seronegative subjects without impacting the overall mortality of the cohort .

in children who experienced multiple diarrheal episodes a multimicronutrient supplement with zinc and vitamin a was more effective in prevent-ing a decline in height for age than was vitamin a alone or vitamin a plus zinc .

in a study of 2- to 6-year-old preschool children supplementation with multimicronu- trients iron and vitamin a led to a reduced incidence of diarrheal illness over 6 months compared to vitamin a alone or vitamin a plus iron .

the critical role of vitamin a in dc differenti- ation  is discussed in the section on vitamin a below.malnutrition and adaptive immune functionthe impact of malnutrition on adaptive immunity has significant implications for both the control of a pathogen and the response to vaccination.

dietary deficiencies in zinc vitamin a vitamin d and protein may also play a role by altering intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation  .

a single dose of vitamin a supplementation enhanced the phagocytic capacity of neutrophils in 68 preschool children evaluated at a venezuelan nutrition clinic 25 were vitamin a deficient .

the number and activity of splenic nk cells were also reduced in vitamin a-deficient rats and returned to normal after vitamin a repletion .

anemic children with vitamin a deficiency showed remarkable increases in the total numbers of cd4 and cd8 t cells after vitamin a supplementation .

vitamin a-deficientmice produced a poor igg response that was restored with vitamin a repletion .

pem compounds vitamin a deficiency due to inadequate amino acid availability in the liver which is required for the synthesis of vitamin a transport proteins such as retinol binding protein.
