While many parts of the world have made progress in reducing the prevalence of stunting the high burdens in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa remain where in 2014 25.1 and 32.0 of children under 5 years of age were stunted and there were an estimated 34.3 millionTABLE 1 Definitions and clinical features of malnutritionaPEMGeneral term describing acute malnutrition resulting from inadequate dietary intake of protein and energy calories it probably has a spectrum of clinical manifestations but is typically classified as marasmus or kwashiorkor severe acute malnutrition see belowAcute malnutritionMalnutrition resulting from inadequate food intakeleading to acute loss of body mass with respect to lengthht for age it can be classified as MAM or SAM it is reversible with adequate nutritional rehabilitationSAM kwashiorkorSevere from of malnutrition resulting from poor-qualitydiet and probably other environmental factors children with kwashiorkor have pitting edema in both feet and lower extremities and in severe cases may have total body edema anasarca liver steatosis is common sores develop on the skin and at the corner of the mouth skin is pale and peels flaky-paint dermatosis these children are apathetic and have little appetiteSAM wasting marasmusAcute malnutrition leading to overt loss of subcutaneousadipose tissue and muscle mass the wasted child is thin for hisher ht but not necessarily short children with marasmus have a thin face with wrinkled skin sunken cheeks and large eyes the loss of normal subcutaneous adipose tissue gives the face an old appearance the abdomen may be swollen they have sagging skin on legs and buttocks they are irritable and have increased appetiteNot well defined except for clinical marasmus and kwashiorkor see belowWHO WFH z scores below median mild z score between -1 and -2 moderate z score between -2 and -3 or MUAC between 125 mm and 115 mm severe z score of -3 or MUAC of 115 mmDiagnosis of kwashiorkor does not rely uponanthropometric measures but only on the presence of bilateral pitting edemaWHO WFH z scores below median severez score of -3 or MUAC of 115 mmChronic malnutritionstuntingMalnutrition resulting from chronic or recurrentinadequate food intake and possibly chronic systemic inflammation it leads to chronic growth faltering typically evident by short stature for age neurocognitive impairment and metabolic changes associated with chronic adult diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypertension the effects of chronic malnutrition are largely irreversible after 24 mo of ageWHO HFA z scores below median mild z scorebetween -1 and -2 moderate z score between -2 and -3 severe z score of -3UnderweightFaltering of linear growth low ht for age wt gain lowwt for age or a combination of both acute on chronic malnutritionMicronutrient deficiencyDeficit of essential vitamins and minerals required fornormal physiological function growth and development micronutrient deficiencies may have no overt clinical signs or symptoms unless they are chronic or severecMedian WFAb mild grade 1 75-90 WFAmoderate grade 2 60-74 WFA severegrade 3 60 WFABased on biochemical measurements with comparison to reference values derived from normal populationsaAbbreviations WHO World Health Organization MAM moderate acute malnutrition SAM severe acute malnutrition WFH weight for height HFA height for age WFA weight for age MUAC mid-upper-arm circumference.bSee reference .cSee .and 13.9 million children affected by wasting respectively .

PEM and zinc deficiency in rats caused a decreased level of produc- tion of immature CD4 CD8 cells due to enhanced thymocyte apoptosis and reduced lymphocyte proliferation .The ability of T cells to respond to inflammatory stimuli is also negatively affected by malnutrition.

We highlight the need for mechanistic studies that can lead to targeted interventions to improve host defense and reduce the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases in this vulnerable population.KEYWORDS Mycobacterium tuberculosis host defense immunology infectious disease malaria malnutrition micronutrients pneumonia sepsisINTRODUCTIONhe synergistic association between malnutrition and infection has been recognized for more than 50 years.

In some instances findings related to adult malnutrition and host defense that are relevant to childhood malnutrition are also discussed.

Acute malnutrition is defined as insufficient weight relative to height while stunting or chronic malnutrition is defined by poor linear growth length or height for age.

Specific nutrient assessment is rarely performed in the classification of childhood malnutrition but children with anthropometric evidence of malnutrition almost certainly have or are at risk for multiple nutrient deficiencies.
