The results demonstrated that the Fusobacterium population in the specimens was composed of five species Fusobacterium periodonticum Fusobacterium canifelinum Fusobacterium varium Fusobacterium simiae andF.

A custom script was used to construct an OTU table from the output files for downstream analyses of alpha-diversity beta-diversity and phylogenetic trends in bacteria.To further examine the 16S V4 reads corresponding to the Fusobacterium genus we used a Fusobacterium 16S V4 consensus sequence as a query sequence for the data search.

animalis predominates in the Fusobacterium population associated with colorectal tumorsIn order to determine the Fusobacterium spp.

animalis was the predominant Fusobacterium subspe- cies associated with colorectal cancer in the samples evaluated.We then established a qPCR assay based on the con- firmed 16S rDNA sequences of Fusobacterium spp.

To determine the effect of Fusobacterium onCCL20 protein expression we set up a human cell- bacterium coculture system under normoxic optimal for human cell growth and hypoxic favorable for anaerobic Fusobacterium proliferation conditions.
