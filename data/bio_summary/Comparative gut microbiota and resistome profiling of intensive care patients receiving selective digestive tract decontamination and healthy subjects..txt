this highly prevalent set of resistance genes included tetracycline re- sistance genes teto tetq tetm tetw two aminoglyco- side resistance genes aph3'-iii and an aade-like gene the bacteroidal b-lactam resistance gene cbla and the macrolide resistance gene ermb.genes associated with major antibiotic resistance threats including those identified by the centers for disease control were relatively rare.

sdd lowers patient mortality during icu stay in settings with a low prevalence of antibiotic resistance and reduces the costs associated with icu hospitalization selection of bacteria that are resist- ant to the antimicrobials used in sdd remains a major concern although this is not supported by the results of clinical trials in which conventional culture techniques were used to screen for antibiotic resistance among nosocomial pathogens the patient gut not only is a potential source for op- portunistic pathogens but also forms a large reservoirfor antibiotic resistance genes termed the gut resistome - the use of antibiotics may favor the selection for antimicrobial resistance genes args among mem- bers of the gut microbiota thus increasing the likelihood of horizontal spread of args between commensals and opportunistic pathogens co-residing in the gut dur- ing the administration of sdd the gut resistome of patients is monitored by the cultivation of resistant bacteria from rectal swabs or feces as part of routine diagnostics.

thermal cycling and real-time imaging was performed on the biomark instru- ment and ct values were extracted using the biomark real-time pcr analysis software.target selection primer design and primer validation the primer set used in the qpcr assays covered 81 anti- microbial resistance genes args of 14 resistance gene classes additional file primers were designed for the args that are most commonly detected in the gut microbiota of healthy individuals  and clinically relevant args including genes encoding extended spectrum b-lactamases esbls carbapenemases and proteins involved in vancomycin resistance.

while culture-based studies did not demonstrate selection for antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogens during sdd treatment    concerns remain that selection for antibiotic resistance genes occurs in the gut microbiota of patients that are treated by sdd during their stay in the icu.the current study describes the composition of the gut microbiota and the resistome of icu patients receiv- ing sdd during icu stay and compares these findings to the microbiota and resistome of healthy subjects.

all e. coli strains were susceptible to colistin.resistome dynamics in icu patients and healthy subjects a total of 46 unique args conferring resistance to 12 different classes of antimicrobials were detected in the dna isolated from fecal samples of hospitalized patients and healthy subjects additional file the number of detected resistance genes per sample ranged between 6 and 38. eleven resistance genes were detected in 80 of healthy subjects and critically ill patients.

however methods that rely on microbial culture capture only a fraction of the gut resistome since anaerobic commensals which are the main reservoir of args in the gut microbiota are difficult to culture -thus culture-independent methods are needed to comprehensively assess the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on the microbiota and resistome of icu patients.here we used the 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene- targeted human intestinal tract chip hitchip and nanolitre-scale quantitative pcr qpcr targeting 81 args to determine the dynamics of gut microbiota composition and resistome in patients receiving sdd during icu hospitalization.

the microbiota profiles of healthy subjects clustered together indicating that they had stable and broadly comparable microbiota profiles which were clearly distinct from the microbiota profiles of patients during and after icu stay.

additionally all primer sets were aligned to all resistance genes that were targeted in this pcr analysis to test for cross hybridization with genes other than the intended target resistance gene.

among resistance genes that are associated with gram-positive pathogens the staphylococcal methicillin resistance gene meca was detected in 13 samples from eight of ten patients but not in samples of healthy sub- jects.

in this observational study we found little evidence for the selection of high-risk resistance determinants like esbls carbapenemases or vancomycin resistance genes in sdd-treated pa- tients during their stay in the icu.

the first three resistance genes contribute to resistance in enterococci either to relatively low con- centrations of antibiotics aac6'-ii or to classes of antimicrobials that are of limited relevance for the treatment of enterococcal infections ermc and qaca.

it remains to be deter- mined whether sdd leads to selection for vre in coun- tries where these bacteria are more prevalent.conclusionsour data support the notion that in settings with low levels of circulating antibiotic resistance genes icu hospitalization and sdd treatment does not lead to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes with high clinical relevance.

esbls carbapenemases or vancomycin resistance pro- teins in the resistome of patients may lead to the imple- mentation of targeted antibiotic therapy or infection control measures to minimize the risk for selection and spread of these resistance genes.additional filesdiseases and vaccines bilthoven the netherlands.

disinfectants are widely used in icus as cleaning and infection control agents  and their use could se- lect for qaca in the gut microbiota of patients.two resistance genes cata and tetw were more abundant in healthy individuals than in icu patients.
