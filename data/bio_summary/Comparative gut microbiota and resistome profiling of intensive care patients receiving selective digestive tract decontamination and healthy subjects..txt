SDD lowers patient mortality during ICU stay in settings with a low prevalence of antibiotic resistance and reduces the costs associated with ICU hospitalization Selection of bacteria that are resist- ant to the antimicrobials used in SDD remains a major concern although this is not supported by the results of clinical trials in which conventional culture techniques were used to screen for antibiotic resistance among nosocomial pathogens The patient gut not only is a potential source for op- portunistic pathogens but also forms a large reservoirfor antibiotic resistance genes termed the gut resistome - The use of antibiotics may favor the selection for antimicrobial resistance genes ARGs among mem- bers of the gut microbiota thus increasing the likelihood of horizontal spread of ARGs between commensals and opportunistic pathogens co-residing in the gut Dur- ing the administration of SDD the gut resistome of patients is monitored by the cultivation of resistant bacteria from rectal swabs or feces as part of routine diagnostics.

This highly prevalent set of resistance genes included tetracycline re- sistance genes tetO tetQ tetM tetW two aminoglyco- side resistance genes aph3'-III and an aadE-like gene the bacteroidal b-lactam resistance gene cblA and the macrolide resistance gene ermB.Genes associated with major antibiotic resistance threats including those identified by the Centers for Disease Control were relatively rare.

Thermal cycling and real-time imaging was performed on the BioMark instru- ment and Ct values were extracted using the BioMark Real-Time PCR analysis software.Target selection primer design and primer validation The primer set used in the qPCR assays covered 81 anti- microbial resistance genes ARGs of 14 resistance gene classes Additional file Primers were designed for the ARGs that are most commonly detected in the gut microbiota of healthy individuals  and clinically relevant ARGs including genes encoding extended spectrum b-lactamases ESBLs carbapenemases and proteins involved in vancomycin resistance.

The qPCR was performed using Maxima SYBR GreenROX qPCR Master Mix Thermo Scientific Leus- den The Netherlands and a StepOnePlus instrument Applied Biosystems Nieuwekerk ad IJssel The Netherlands with 5 ng DNA in the reaction and the fol- lowing program 95 degC for 10 min and subsequently 40 cycles of 95 degC for 15 s and 56 degC for 1 min.Calculation of normalized and cumulative abundance Normalized abundance of resistance genes was calcu- lated relative to the abundance of the 16S rRNA gene CTARG - CT16S rRNA resulting in a log2-transformed estimate of ARG abundance.

Further demographic information on both cohorts is provided in Additional file DNA from fecal samples of patients and healthy subject was isolated as previously described using two rounds of bead beating and purification using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit columns Qiagen Venlo The Netherlands.Gut microbiota profiling by HITChipThe HITChip is a validated phylogenetic array produced by Agilent Technologies Palo Alto CA and developed at Wageningen University The Netherlands It contains over 4800 oligonucleotides targeting the V1 and the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene from 1132 micro- bial phylotypes present in the human gut The full- length 16S rRNA gene was amplified from fecal DNA and PCR products were further processed and hybridized to the microarrays as described previously .

While culture-based studies did not demonstrate selection for antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogens during SDD treatment    concerns remain that selection for antibiotic resistance genes occurs in the gut microbiota of patients that are treated by SDD during their stay in the ICU.The current study describes the composition of the gut microbiota and the resistome of ICU patients receiv- ing SDD during ICU stay and compares these findings to the microbiota and resistome of healthy subjects.

The microbiota profiles of healthy subjects clustered together indicating that they had stable and broadly comparable microbiota profiles which were clearly distinct from the microbiota profiles of patients during and after ICU stay.

All E. coli strains were susceptible to colistin.Resistome dynamics in ICU patients and healthy subjects A total of 46 unique ARGs conferring resistance to 12 different classes of antimicrobials were detected in the DNA isolated from fecal samples of hospitalized patients and healthy subjects Additional file The number of detected resistance genes per sample ranged between 6 and 38.

The first three resistance genes contribute to resistance in enterococci either to relatively low con- centrations of antibiotics aac6'-Ii or to classes of antimicrobials that are of limited relevance for the treatment of enterococcal infections ermC and qacA.

ESBLs carbapenemases or vancomycin resistance pro- teins in the resistome of patients may lead to the imple- mentation of targeted antibiotic therapy or infection control measures to minimize the risk for selection and spread of these resistance genes.Additional filesDiseases and Vaccines Bilthoven The Netherlands.
