based on these data the acetaminophen-metabolizing activities of mouse fecal suspension were measured as 0.029 - 0.028 nmolhmg.next to investigate the in vivo effects of probiotics on the metabolic activity of acetaminophen by gut microbiota we orally administered probiotics to mice and measured fecal acetaminophen-metabolizing activity 24 h after the final oral administration of the probiotics fig.

7. at the phylum level probiotics treatment with k8 significantly increased the number of cyanobacteria whereas k9 treatment increased the number of deferribacteres.to investigate whether orally administered probiotics adhered into the gastrointestinal tract we orally administered probiotics to mice and analyzed the amount of k8 or k9 in the epithelia of the stomach and upper small intestine using pcr.

2007. thereforeto understand the effects of probiotics on the pharmacokinetics of frequently used drugs weevaluated the effect of probiotics on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered acetaminophen in mice.materials and methodsmaterialsacetaminophen formic acid and dextrose were purchased from sigma st. louis mo usa.

the fresh feces approximately 0.1 g were collected 6 h before probiotics treatment 1 or 3 days after the final gavage of probiotics.

taken collectively k8 and k9 were supposed to be the most characteristic probiotics and thus we selected these two probiotics for subsequent studies where we investigated the effects of k8 and k9 on the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen fig.

these probiotics also caused the composition of gut microbiota to fluctuate the probiotics increased firmicutes and bacteroides phyla in the colon but inhibited the proteobacteria phylum.

lcqtofms liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometerabstractorally administered probiotics change gut microbiota composition and enzyme activities.

thus coadministration of probiotics with drugs may lead to changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs.

in this study we investigated the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in mice treated with probiotics.

oral administration of probiotics changed the gut microbiota composition in the mice.

of these probiotics lactobacillus reuteri k8 increased the numbers of clostridia bifidobacteria and enterococci and lactobacillus rhamnosus k9 decreased the number of bifidobacteria determined by culturing in selective media.
