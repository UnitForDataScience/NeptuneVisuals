Applied medium- scale industrial tests are currently in progress.Keywords Yeasts Debaryomyces hansenii fermented sausages selection of starter strains Valle de los PedrochesIntroductionYeasts and lactic acid bacteria are two predominant groups of microorganisms usually found in fermented sausages yet whereas lactobacilli are mainly in the meat batter yeasts are most frequently found on the sausage surface 1.

The most common starter cultures used in the manufacture of fermented sausage products belong to different species of lactic acid bacteria and Staphylococcus 13 14 but in some fermented sausages from Southern European countries molds and yeasts are also being included as starter cultures for their positive effects on flavor and texture 2 6 14 15.D.

i Toxic biogenic amines can be found in dry fermented sausages at relevant concentrations and the amounts of these amines have been previously related to both temperature and NaCl in salami due to their influence on the lactic acid bacteria populations 45. ii Although Debaryomyces has been reported as a halotolerant yeast this character significantly varies between strains belonging to the same species 46. iii Finally D. hansenii is relatively sensitive to high temperatures.

The stress tests included the two control laboratory strains S. cerevisiae BY4741 and D. hansenii 767 and 22 yeasts isolated from the fermented sausages.Fig.

In general the qualitative characteristics of naturally fermented sausages are known to be largely dependent on i the quality of the ingredients and raw materials ii the specific conditions of the processing and ripening and iii the composition of the microbial populations.Accordingly this study attempted to isolate and identify the indigenous yeast microbiota present in three types of Iberian fermented sausage lomo chorizo and salchichon from the Valle de los Pedroches region Cordoba Spain.

Impact of Debaryomyces hansenii strains inoculation on the quality of slow dry-cured fermented sausages.

Four new Candida cretensis strains isolated from Spanish fermented sausages chorizo taxonomic and phylogenetic implications.

Yeast strains as potential aroma enhancers in dry fermented sausages.

Moreover strains LR2 and LRF1 showed enhanced enzymatic capacities Table 2B.DiscussionThis study isolated 22 yeast strains from sausages produced in Valle de los Pedroches.

D. hansenii can prevent the formation of lipid oxidation products in fermented sausages and contributes to improve sensory components principally flavors such as ethyl esters.
