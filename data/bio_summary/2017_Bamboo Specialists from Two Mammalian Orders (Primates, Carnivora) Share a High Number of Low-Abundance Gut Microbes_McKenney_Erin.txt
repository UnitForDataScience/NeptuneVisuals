The meta- bolic rate of the red panda is also low 39 of predicted value presumably to reduce energy requirements  and the daily energy expenditure of the giant panda is only 37.7 of the predicted value .The giant pandas' two most abundant bacterial OTUs an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus and Streptococcus were also found to be dominant in previous studies of the giant panda GM   .

103 sequences per sample did not detect dietary signatures in the giant panda or red panda GM  our increased coverage approach reveals 48 OTUs comprising a bamboo-associated core GM.

This transition indicates that for giant pandas Enterobacteriaceae may not be invaders so much as a nor- mal part of the healthy adult GM structure in species with relatively simple gut morphology.Diet May Govern Low-Abundance OTUsThe bamboo lemur shares six times more OTUs with other bamboo specialists than with its sister species Fig.

Two species are distantly related members of the order Carnivora the giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the red panda Ailurus fulgens diverged 47.5 my  and one is a member of the order Primates the bamboo lemur Hapalemur griseus di- verged from Carnivora 83 my .

To address these questions we used deep sequencing to investigate the nature and comparative impact of phylogenetic and dietary selection for specific gut microbial membership in three bamboo specialists--the bamboo lemur Hapalemur griseus Primates Lemuridae giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca Carnivora Ursidae and red panda Ailurus fulgens Carnivora Musteloideadae as well as two phylogenetic controls--the ringtail lemur Lemur catta and the Asian black bear Ursus thibetanus.

were the first to compare gut microbes in bamboo specialists using next-generation sequencing  relatively low coverage may have precluded detection of low-abundance diet-associated OTUs in previous studies of giant panda and red panda GMs.

also found that the giant panda GM is more similar to that of the Asian black bear than it is to the red panda  further suggesting that phylogenetic signal overrides die- tary signal in this case.While Li et al.

The lack of morphological adapta- tion to diet might suggest that GM composition will be especially important in these host species for adequately digesting their respective high-fiber diets.Most studies to date have been unable to detect a strong dietary signature in giant panda GMs  -.

We detected significantly higher Shannon diversity in the bamboo lemur 10.029 compared to both the giant panda 8.256 p  0.0001936 and the red panda 6.484 p  0.0000029.

Notably while most mammal GMs are dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes our re- sults confirm previous observations    that both giant panda and red panda GMs are dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes but not Bacteroidetes Fig.
