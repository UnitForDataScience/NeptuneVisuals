representative sequences for each otu were subjected to the rdp classifier to determine the taxonomy with a bootstrap cutoff of 80 rdp database version 2.10.accession numberthe full-length 16s rrna gene sequences of the representative bacterial strains isolated from the breast milk and mouse feces and the 16s rrna gene v3 region sequences of the dgge band sequences were deposited in genbank under accession numbers ky038179-ky038195 and ky082697-ky082707 respectively.16s rrna gene v3-v4 region illumina sequences of the breast milk and mice feces were deposited in ncbi sequence read archive sra under accession numbers prjna351774 breast milk prjna351775 mice at week 8 and prjna377923 mice at weeks 1-6.resultsthe colonization of breast milk bacteria in germ-free mice monitored by dggedgge of 16s rrna gene v3 region amplicons detects bacteria representing more than 1 of the whole community randomly amplified with t7 and sp6 as the primers.

we here performed dgge and clustering analysis of the dgge profiles to compare bacterial composition of the milk inoculum and the feces of recipient mice  and supplementary figure s1.the fecal microbiota of recipient mice became stabilized by 2-4 weeks after gavage according to clustering dendrogram of dgge profiles of mice at different time points andsupplementary figure s1.

the above six dgge bands represented the breast milk bacteria that stably colonized the gut of recipient mice at the abundance  1.the colonization of breast milk bacteria in germ-free mice monitored with illumina sequencing of 16s rrna gene v3-v4 regionthe breast milk inoculum and feces of 10 recipient mice at weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 were subjected to illumina sequencing of 16s rrna gene v3-v4 regions and 25366 and 46303 26452 median 34864 upper quartile 51414 and lower quartile 30531 high-quality reads were obtained for the milk and the mouse feces respectively.

in contrast the obligatory anaerobes faecalibacterium prevotella roseburia unclassified lachnospiraceae ruminococcus and bacteroides stayed at very low abundance in recipient mice 0.003-0.01. the dominance of aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria over obligatory anaerobes in the colon of our recipient mice resemble the observation of gut microbiota composition of human neonates in the first week of life   and this is probably because the intestine of both germ-free mice   and human newborns younger than 1-week-old is still in an aerobic condition.

in contrast in the feces of our breast milk microbiota-associate mice the percentage of staphylococcus isolates decreased to only 15.2 and isolates of streptococcus bacteria which are prevalent in the gut microbiota of chinese people     accounted for 84.7. furthermore our results showed that the facultative anaerobic gut-associated bacteria from the breast milk inoculum stably colonized the gut of recipient mice and that obligatory anaerobes were repeatedly detected at multiple time points in some recipient mice.

no previous study has transplanted human breast milk microbiota to germfree mice to screen for the breast milk bacteria that can colonize the gut.in the present study germ-free mice fed on normal chow were inoculated orally with the breast milk of one 38-year-old mother 2 days after vaginal delivery and the microbiota composition of milk inoculum and mouse feces were compared with 16s rrna gene profiling and microbiological culture techniques.materials and methodssubject and breast milk collectionthe breast milk was collected from a 38-year-old mother 2 days after vaginal delivery at term.

the sequences were binned into otus at the 97 similarity level and 165 otus were generated after chimeras and singleton filtering.thirty-seven otus were present in both the milk and week8 mouse feces  and supplementary table s1 51 were detected only in the milk  and supplementary table s1 and 19 existed only in the mouse feces and supplementary table s1.three otus from staphylococcus otu2 and streptococcus otu1 and otu4 were among the most abundant bacteria in both the milk and feces of 10 mice at week 8 the abundance of staphylococcus decreased from 37.4 in the milk to 7.6 1.6 range 5.6-11.1 in the feces of recipient mice in contrast the abundance of streptococcus otu1 and otu4 increased from 56.0 in the milk to 80.3 2.3 range 77.6-86.3 in the mouse feces .

the above 5 otus were detected in all 10 mice at most of the time points 5 from weeks 1 to 8 and their abundances remained stable from weeks 6 to 8 supplementary figure s2 and table s2.some gut-associated anaerobic bacteria from faecalibacterium otu6 prevotella otu11 roseburia otu8 unclassified lachnospiraceae otu39 ruminococcus otu27 and bacteroides otu13 were present at low abundance in the milk inoculum 0.01-1 and in the feces of some but not all recipient mice at week 8 0.003-0.01 .

it showed 99 similarity to thetable 3  otus detected only in the feces of recipient mice at week 8 but not in the breast milk inoculum.ss ten mice in total.figure 3  phylogenetic tree of the representative bacterial isolates of 17 eric types and other known bacteria.

in the present study the breast milk inoculum was the only source of commensal bacteria for the recipient mice and bifidobacteria were detected in the feces of recipient mice but not in the breast milk inoculum with illumina sequencing of 16s rrnagene.

however while the aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria are replaced by obligatory anaerobic bacteria within first weeks of life in the gut microbiota of human infants   the fecal microbiota of our recipient mice stabilized with the dominance of aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria for 4-6 weeks in different mice.

here to identify the breast milk bacteria capable of colonizing gut without the interference of bacteria of origins other than the milk or the necessity to analyze infant feces normal chow-fed germ-free mice were orally inoculated with the breast milk collected from a mother 2 days after vaginal delivery.

according to 16s rrna gene-based denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis and illumina sequencing bacteria at 1 abundance in the milk inoculum were only streptococcus 56.0 and staphylococcus 37.4 but in the feces of recipient mice were streptococcus 80.3 - 2.3 corynebacterium 10.0 - 2.6  staphylococcus7.6 - 1.6 and propionibacterium 2.1 - 0.5 that were previously shown as dominant bacterial genera in the meconium of c-section-delivered human babies the abundance of anaerobic gut-associated bacteria faecalibacterium prevotella roseburia ruminococcus and bacteroides was 0.01-1 in the milk inoculum and 0.003-0.01 in mouse feces the abundance of bifidobacterium spp.
