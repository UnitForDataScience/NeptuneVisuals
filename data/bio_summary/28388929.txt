In the 18S rRNA gene and concatenated gene analyses the clade GS01 was placed in a sister position to all remaining fungi al- though the statistical support for this and most other early branching configurations remained poor Additional file  Figures S1-S3.Altogether 11 clades GS2-GS12 and three distinct branches 32 of previously unclassified soil fungi were placed within Rozellomycota Cryptomycota.

Because many of these lineages are not known from vou- cher material the inability to name organisms only on the basis of sequence data hinders higher-level classification of fungi and other taxa .Here we aim to determine the phylogenetic placement of previously unclassified soil fungi by developing 452 taxon-specific primers Additional file Table S1 tar- Correspondence 1Natural History Museum University of Tartu 14a Ravila 50411 Tartu Estonia Full list of author information is available at the end of the articlegeting nuclear 18S nSSU and 28S nLSU rRNA genes in 263 ITS-based operational taxonomic units OTUsc The Authors.

The most common is- sues with specific primers included i multipleamplicons seen as smear on the gel 18S rRNA gene no amplification 18S and 28S rRNA genes and poor fit- ting of the complementary sequencing primer resulting in poor signal 18S rRNA gene.

The soil powder was subjected to chem- ical analysis of macro- and micronutrients and DNA ex- traction 2 g and 454 pyrosequencing followed by quality filtering clustering at 98 sequence similarity and removal of singletons From the final data set of 50589 operational taxonomic units OTUs we identi- fied taxa originally assigned to fungi or rare protist groups as well as taxa with unknown taxonomicFig.

The groups branch5 four OTUs clades GS06 five OTUs and GS26 four OTUs exhibited the strongest endemicity being distrib- uted exclusively in Australia Europe and Northern South America respectively.

Altogether 138 OTUs were represented by both 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequences whereas sequencing failed completely for 25 OTUs.

Individual reads were generally of high quality indicating the sequence origin to be that of a single organism.We obtained high-quality 18S andor 28S rRNA gene Sanger sequences for 90.5 of the targeted OTUs in- cluding all but two major groups 10 OTUs.

2 Phylogenetic placement of soil-inhabiting fungi among identified taxa and other sequences from the environment based on a simplified concatenated 18S and 28S rRNA gene maximum likelihood phylogram.

For each of these taxa we de- signed reverse and forward primers in the variable part of the ITS region according to the following criteria i melting temperature of primers 54-58 degC ii ATCG ra- tio 33-62 iii primer length 16-21 bases iv perfect match of the last 10 bases to 20 OTUs in the whole data set usually matching no other OTUs and v dis- tance from the flanking 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes 20 bases to allow detection of unspecific amplification.To amplify the 18S rRNA gene the specific reverse primers were paired with the NS5a and NS7a primers Additional file Table S1.
