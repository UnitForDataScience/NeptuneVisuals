The specific detection of archaeal signatures suffers from methodological problems on various levels including DNA extraction selection of suitable primers a low abundance of archaeal DNA or incompleteness of 16S rRNA gene reference databases for more detailed information on these issues see Text S1 in the supplemental material for a summary of the targeted archaeal groups and genes sample types molecular methods and primers that have been used to detect Archaea in human-associated samples see Table S1.Besides those methodological problems archaeome research faces another chal- lenge with no known archaeal pathogen these species are mostly ignored and the need for a detailed analysis is not recognized within the big and well-funded field of clinical microbiology  .In this study we are taking the first step in a long row of necessary improvements for the specific detection of archaea in large studies.

The nested PCR method was used to i preselect archaeal fragments ii increase the amount of archaeal signatures and iii avoid the formation of primer dimers which were observed when primers tagged with Illumina adapter and barcode were used without previous amplification.After the initial PCR with the well-established primer pair 344f915r which is very selective for the archaeal domain either primer combination 349af519ar coverage without a mismatch 78.7 of Archaea and 0 of Bacteria on the basis of in silico analysis targeting Archaea or primer combination 519af785ur coverage without a mismatch 88.7 of Archaea and 88.5 of Bacteria targeting both Bacteria and Archaea  were used in a subsequent PCR approach see Materials and Methods for details.

Moreover this technique allowed us to identify potential novel archaeal members of the human microbial communities detect archaeal signa- tures in the nose and lung and finally reveal body site specificity for the human archaeome.FIG 5 Phylogenetic tree of retrieved archaeal signatures affiliated with Euryarchaeota Thaumarchaeota and the DPANN superphylum.

The primer pair 349af519ar following the first PCR with 344f915r allowed the retrieval of solely archaeal sequences and was as expected found to be the mostTABLE 2 Summary of the bioinformatics pipelines and primer combinations used and archaeal and bacterial OTUsRSVs detected in the stool samples studieda349af519ar 344f915r519af785ur 344f915r484 - 80b 622 - 27 0 - 0.50 - 0100320 - 70411 - 310 - 00 - 01008 - 215 - 50 - 00 - 010036 - 2.537 - 2216 - 9084 - 4416-448990 - 2030 7869 - 1182 146 - 4583 - 4098-9963 - 2252 - 1369 - 2721 - 1948-71515f806r0 - 01 - 0.54873 - 1146 6618 - 874 0-0.021 - 01 - 020648 - 6208 25063 - 7033 0.004-0.005 0 - 11 - 1166 - 24 274 - 43 0-0.36aThe primer pair in parentheses 344f915r was used in the first round of a nested PCR.

By this approach all of the data processing pipelines tested were able to capture only one archaeal OTU per sample corresponding to 0 to 0.36 of the OTUs and RSVs retrieved  last column.On the basis of our analyses primer pair 349af519ar proved superior to the other primer pairs tested with respect to archaeal specificity and thus was used later in this study to analyze human tissue samples.

The same trend was observed with archaeal OTUs and RSVs respectively as we obtained 911 archaeal OTUs with QIIME 999 OTUs with mothur and 50 RSVs with DADA2 for full details see Table S2.FIG 1 Alpha diversity based on the inverse Simpson diversity index in BAL fluidlung blue GIT brown nasal red and skin yellow samples.When analyzing the stool samples that served as natural mock communities the most conservative and thus most stringent approach was found to be the combination of primer pair 349af519ar 344f915r amplicons with data processing through DADA2.

In total signatures from five archaeal phyla Euryarchaeota Thaumarchaeaota Di- apherotrites Woesearchaeota Aenigmarchaeota the last three phyla are associated with the DPANN Diapherotrites Parvarchaeota Aenigmarchaeota Nanoarchaeota Nano- haloarchaea superphylum  were identified in the human samples along withnumerous unclassified sequences Table S2 more information is shown below.Besides the finding that not only the skin  and gut but also the nose and lung harbor a unique archaeal community we were most surprised by the retrieval of Methanobacterium signatures from the human gut see below and the detection of a broad variety of DPANN superphylum-associated sequences from diverse human sam- ples.

reported a predictable biogeographic bacterial pattern for body sites and even within different parts of body sites  which evidently is also true for archaeal communities.Although RDA plots revealed a grouping of nose- and skin-associated archaeal communities the lung and gut communities did not separate clearly indicating a certain similarity of these communities on the RSV level Text S1 Fig.

The predominance of thaumarchaeal signatures on oxygenated ammoniaurea-rich human skin   was confirmed and DPANN- associated archaea Woesearchaeota and unassigned archaea were detected specifi- cally in samples from the lung .On the basis of these findings the archaeal biogeographic pattern can be divided into i a thaumarchaeal skin landscape ii a methanoeuryarchaeal GIT landscape iii a mixed skin-GIT landscape for the nose and iv a woesearchaeal lung landscape.Network analyses reveal the connection of the archaeal communities on the OTURSV level.

In the resulting RSV table each row corresponds to a nonchimeric inferred sample sequence with a separate taxonomic classification.During data processing samples with no archaeal OTUsRSVs were removed and only samples with archaeal signals were processed further.Every step of the analysis included negative controls consisting of blank DNA extractions for each group of samples and negative controls during PCR amplifications.
