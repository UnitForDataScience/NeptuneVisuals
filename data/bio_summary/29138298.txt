the nested pcr method was used to i preselect archaeal fragments ii increase the amount of archaeal signatures and iii avoid the formation of primer dimers which were observed when primers tagged with illumina adapter and barcode were used without previous amplification.after the initial pcr with the well-established primer pair 344f915r which is very selective for the archaeal domain either primer combination 349af519ar coverage without a mismatch 78.7 of archaea and 0 of bacteria on the basis of in silico analysis targeting archaea or primer combination 519af785ur coverage without a mismatch 88.7 of archaea and 88.5 of bacteria targeting both bacteria and archaea  were used in a subsequent pcr approach see materials and methods for details.

the specific detection of archaeal signatures suffers from methodological problems on various levels including dna extraction selection of suitable primers a low abundance of archaeal dna or incompleteness of 16s rrna gene reference databases for more detailed information on these issues see text s1 in the supplemental material for a summary of the targeted archaeal groups and genes sample types molecular methods and primers that have been used to detect archaea in human-associated samples see table s1.besides those methodological problems archaeome research faces another chal- lenge with no known archaeal pathogen these species are mostly ignored and the need for a detailed analysis is not recognized within the big and well-funded field of clinical microbiology  .in this study we are taking the first step in a long row of necessary improvements for the specific detection of archaea in large studies.

this hypothesis is supported by genomic studies of m. smithii and m. stadtmanae that showed that both species express adhesion-enabling proteins similar to bacterial adhesins .primer pairs and sequence data processing pipelines determine the detection of archaeal operational taxonomic units otus and ribosomal sequence variants rsvs in natural mock communities approach 2. in a preliminary step we tested the efficiency of three different primer pairs suitable for ngs short read length namely 515f806r targeting bacteria and archaea  349af519ar 344f915r target- ing archaea and 519af785ur 344f915r targeting bacteria and archaea  with respect to their specific ability to detect the diverse archaea in human stool samples serving as natural mock communities.

the predominance of thaumarchaeal signatures on oxygenated ammoniaurea-rich human skin   was confirmed and dpann- associated archaea woesearchaeota and unassigned archaea were detected specifi- cally in samples from the lung .on the basis of these findings the archaeal biogeographic pattern can be divided into i a thaumarchaeal skin landscape ii a methanoeuryarchaeal git landscape iii a mixed skin-git landscape for the nose and iv a woesearchaeal lung landscape.network analyses reveal the connection of the archaeal communities on the otursv level.

with all of the data processing pipelines used the percentage of archaeal reads was 100. however the number of archaeal otusrsvs observed was significantly less than that obtained with the 519af785ur primer combination when the sequence data were processed with mothur t test p  0.00007 or dada2 t test p  0.002. conversely a different picture was obtained from the qiime processing pipeline as the same data sets resulted in a higher number of archaeal otus from the more specific primer pair 349af519ar 344f915r than from the combination 519af785ur 344f915r t test p  0.00004.primer pair 519af785ur 344f915r was capable of retrieving the broadest diversity of archaea but because of the different primer specificities a vast variety of bacterial signatures were also obtained.

moreover this technique allowed us to identify potential novel archaeal members of the human microbial communities detect archaeal signa- tures in the nose and lung and finally reveal body site specificity for the human archaeome.fig 5 phylogenetic tree of retrieved archaeal signatures affiliated with euryarchaeota thaumarchaeota and the dpann superphylum.

our results are a solid basis for further investigation of the human archaeome and in the long term discovery of the po- tential role of archaea in human health and disease.keywords archaeome methanogens microbiome archaeaur invisible organ the human microbiome is composed of bacteria eukaryotes archaea and viruses.

in particular methanoarchaea methane-producing archaea methanogens are believed to be keystone species that may have a greater influence on the composition and function of the whole gastrointestinal microbial community than we currently know .to date four species of methanogenic archaea have been cultivated and isolated from human body samples the first isolated and described human-associated archaeon methanobrevibacter smithii  methanosphaera stadtmanae  and most recently methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis  were all isolated from human feces.

on the other hand methanogenic archaea have been reported to be associated with different disease patterns such as the development of inflammatory bowel disease  dental disease   or potentially even brain abscesses .however not all human gut-associated archaea are methanogens unknown mem- bers of the orders desulfurococcales sulfolobales thermoproteales nitrososphaerales and halobacteriales have also been detected in the human intestine .

recently a new species of halophilic archaea haloferax massiliensis  has been isolated from the human gut again raising the question of whether halophilic archaea could poten- tially be permanent residents .

as a proof of principle we applied our most specific and conservative protocol to a variety of human tissue samples including skin samples lung samples biopsy specimens from the gastrointestinal tract git stool samples and nasal samples uncovering a previously unknown diversity of archaea associated with specific sites of the human body.results and discussionhuman-associated archaea remain similar to fungi or viruses understudied in the field of microbiome research.

we used two human stool samples from healthy persons as this type of sample is often used for microbiome analyses and as archaea have been successfully detected in human stool samples in the past .the first primer pair we tested was the commonly used universal primer pair 515f806r targeting both bacteria and archaea  proposed by the hmp and the emp.

for the other approaches we selected more archaea-specific procedures based on a nested pcr approach using primers 344f and 915r in the first pcr and primer pair s-d-arch-0349- a-s-17s-d-arch-0519-a-a-16 here 349af519ar targeting archaea or primer pair s-d-arch-0519-a-s-15 s-d-bact-0785-b-a-18 here 519af785ur targeting both bacteria and archaea in the subsequent pcr .
