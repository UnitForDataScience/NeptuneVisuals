Recent research also confirmed gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet within 1 day   and an animal-based diet had a greater effect on the microbiota than a plant-based diet.In our previous study the effect of subjects' gut microbiota communities by the diet intervention of carbohydrate-rich meals composed principally of wheat rice and oats was investigated by the PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing technology based on 16S rRNA variable region.

The previous research only focused on the changes in the microbial taxonomic level but the intestinal microbiome including the microbial taxonomy and microbial function and metabolic pathway.

The balance of the gut microbial community is a major determining factor in human physiological functions.Many reports have demonstrated determining factors of the gut microbial community these includehost genotype diet age body-mass-index disease and use of antibiotic  .

A recent study comparing fecal microbiota profile of central Asian China and Japan and Southeast Asia Indonesia and Thailand speculated that non-digestible carbohydrates and meat consumption are determining dietary factors in the Bacteroides-enterotype  .It is the aim of this study to investigate the effect of the three staple food grains on the gut microbial communities via diet intervention.The typical Mongolian diet is characterized by a high and frequent consumption of fermented dairy products and red meat and a low level of the grain intake.

Present research will contribute to understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary factor microbial populations and the health of global humans.Keywords intestinal microbiome carbohydrateutilization shotgun-metagenomic-sequencing Mongolians staple foodINTRODUCTIONThe sequencing-based assessment of microbial communities in human feces has uncovered a large quantity 1014 and types 1000 of microbial species colonizing the human gut.

The intestinal microbiome was composed of the microbial taxonomy microbial function and metabolic pathway.

It is commonly accepted that diet has a major influence on the gut microbial community however the effects of diet is not fully understood.

The structure of the gut microbial community can be changed by long-term consumption of a habitual diet       as well as short-term consumption of certain diets  .

The effects of carbohydrate staple diet on the gut microbial community have been little studied.

The second group including the species of Alistipesonderdonkii Bacteroides fragilis Bifidobacterium adolescentis Bifidobacterium breve Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum Lactobacillus ruminis Ruminococcus gnavus and Streptococcus thermophilus and they were closely related to the carbohydrate-active enzymes of beta-glucosidase mannosidase trehalose phosphorylase fucosidase and sialidase.The Linear Relationship between Intestinal Microbial Phylum and Main Nutrient ElementsThe results above based on the impacts of changes in staple food on intestinal microbiome offered us an excellent opportunity to reveal the linear relationship between intestinal microbial phylum and main nutrient elements which was also the basic mechanism related to the interaction between the diet and gut microbiome.
