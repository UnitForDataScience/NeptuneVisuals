To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first to use 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to demon- strate improvements in the microbiota of supragingival plaque and tongue coating through long-term ingestion of food.In the present clinical study we collected tongue coating and supragingival plaque not subgingival plaque and saliva.

Decreases in the total relative abundance of gram-negative organisms in supragingival plaque and tongue coating correlated with improvements in assessed variables related to oral health such as oral malodor and plaque accumulation.

The number of samples of supragingival plaque and tongue coating are summa- rized in Supplemental Table S1.Microbiota composition at the phylum levelThe 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis identified a total of 1012766 and 1302024 high-quality paired sequences obtained from 84 samples of supragingival plaque and103 samples of tongue coating respectively with 12056.73400.0 and 12641.03322.6 average SD reads per sample respectively.

Although supragingival plaque and tongue coating had similar compositions at the phylum level significant differences between supragingival plaque and tongue coating were identified by UniFrac principal coordinate analysis PCoA Supplemental Fig.

UniFrac PCoA showed that the microbial communities are different in supragingival plaque and tongue coating which is consistent with previous findings that supragingival plaque communities differ more than microbial com- munities from seven other oral sites including tongue coating.

Therefore the compositions of the microbiota of supragingival plaque and tongue coating need to be examined in more detail to enable evaluation of their effects on oral health.In both supragingival plaque and tongue coating in the test group most bacterial species that decreased or increased significantly were gram-negative and -positive respectively.

In the present study the diversity indices of microbiota of supragingival plaque were significantly lower in the test than in the placebo group at 8 weeks suggesting that long-term ingestion of the test tablets suppresses increases in microbial diversity of supragingival plaque related to deterioration in oral conditions.Repeated usage of antibiotics is not recommended because of potential issues associated with microbial substitution 6.

In this randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled study the effects of long-term ingestion of LF and LPO-containing tablets on the microbiota of supragingival plaque and tongue coating were assessed.

Most of the bacterial species in supragingival plaque and tongue coating that exhibited significant decreases in the test group were gram-negative bacteria including periodontal pathogens.
