The OVX-HF group was characterized by increased abundance of Lactobacillus LDA 4.68 p-value  0.05 Dorea LDA  3.56 p-value  0.024 Akkermansia muciniphila LDA  4.37 p-value  0.043 and Desulfovibrio species LDA  4.12 p-value  0.05.Ovariectomy Induced Differential Gene ExpressionGene expression in the liver tissue was significantly different in the OVX group compared with the SHAM control group Fig.

In the control group the dominant bacterial group was the phylum Bacteroidetes.

The result of the enrichment map test using KEGG pathways showed that 177 metabolic pathways differed in the OVX group compared with that in the SHAM control group.

In particular the gene expression of estrogen signaling pathways differed significantly in the OVX group compared with the SHAM control group.

The OVX-HF group showed a similar microbiome composition as the OVX group except for the presence of a few different taxa.We expected the differential expression of estrogen signaling pathways in OVX treatment.

Several other bacteria including Dorea A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio species showed an additional increase in their abundance observed in the OVX-HF group relative to that in the OVX group that is a high-fat diet further enhanced the ovariectomy-induced increase in the abundance of these species.

The final body weight and amount of adipose tissue in mice in the OVX SHAM-HF and OVX-HF groups were significantly increased relative to the SHAM group Table 1.

The highest weight gain was observed in the OVX-HF group followed by the SHAM-HF and OVXTable 1.

The OVX OVX-HF and SHAM-HF groups tended to have increased triglyceride total cholesterol and LDL- cholesterol levels AI and CRF and decreased HDL- cholesterol levels compared with the control group SHAM but these differences were not statistically significant in some cases.
