several bacterial taxa such as moryella sporobacter barnesiella eggerthella porphyromonadaceae and oscillospira which have been reported to show differential abundance upon ovariectomy 35 were not detected or showed no significant differences between ovx and sham groups in our study.additionally we found that the high-fat diet increased the proportion of phylum firmicutes from 20 to 85of previous animal and human studies 37-39. at aand decreased the proportion of phylum bacteroidetesfrom 78 to 6 which were consistent with the reportslower taxonomic level a decrease in the abundance of ruminococcaceae rikenellaceae lachnospiraceae bacteroides and prevotella species and an increase in the abundance of lactobacillus species were observed in the sham-hf group in our study this result was also in line with previous reports 40 41. the ovx-hf group showed a similar microbiome composition as the ovx group except for the presence of a few different taxa.we expected the differential expression of estrogen signaling pathways in ovx treatment.

the ovx group showed increased abundance of lactobacillus species lda  4.68 p-value  0.049 and the exclusive presence of bifidobacterium animalis lda  3.36 p-value  0.043. the ovx-hf group was characterized by increased abundance of lactobacillus lda 4.68 p-value  0.05 dorea lda  3.56 p-value  0.024 akkermansia muciniphila lda  4.37 p-value  0.043 and desulfovibrio species lda  4.12 p-value  0.05.ovariectomy induced differential gene expressiongene expression in the liver tissue was significantly different in the ovx group compared with the sham control group fig.

the differences in taxa abundance depending on categorical metadata were evaluated using hotelling's t-test p-value  0.05 and lefse analyses lda score  2.50 29. the taxa identified at the species level based on the greengene database were further evaluated using the eztaxon-e database 30.mouse gene expression analysesrna was extracted from the liver tissue using an rneasy lipid tissue mini kit qiagen germany.

several other bacteria including dorea a. muciniphila and desulfovibrio species showed an additional increase in their abundance observed in the ovx-hf group relative to that in the ovx group that is a high-fat diet further enhanced the ovariectomy-induced increase in the abundance of these species.

at a lower taxonomic level we observed a decrease in the abundance of ruminococcaceae rikenellaceae clostridia bacteroidales s24-7 bacteroides and prevotella species and an increase in the abundance of lactobacillus species which was also in line with a previous report 35. however the details of the microbiome changes observed in our study were different from those observed in previous studies.

in the ovx group lactobacillus was dominant and the abundance of akkermansia species was increased in the ovx-hf group.bacterial taxa showing differences between groups were identified by lefse analyses and statistical evaluation fig.

after 1 week of acclimatization the mice were divided into four groups sham sham-operated mice n  3 ovx ovariectomized mice n  5 sham-hf sham-operated mice given a high-fat diet n  3 and ovx-hf ovariectomized mice given a high-fat diet n  5. the low-fat diet groups sham and ovx were fed with normal chow diet 40 rmm purchased from central laboratory animal inc. korea.

multifaceted studies on the gut microbiome and estrogen levels during menopause have revealed that the estrobolome the estrogen metabolism-related genes possessed by the microbiome plays an important role in estrogen circulation 22 23. the order clostridiales and the genus bacteroides have also been reported to be correlated with the urinary estrogens level in postmenopausal women 20. moreover over a hundred intestinal bacteria in postmenopausal women with obesity have been found to be correlated with metabolic risk markers including insulin resistance inflammation and lipid metabolism 24.although there have been many studies on the microbiome profile of animal models and humans it is not known whether postmenopausal weight gain induces the same changes in the gut microbiome as dietary-induced obesity does.

in the ovx and sham-hf groups the phylum firmicutes was dominant and the phylum actinobacteria showed increased abundance.

the final body weight and amount of adipose tissue in mice in the ovx sham-hf and ovx-hf groups were significantly increased relative to the sham group table 1. the highest weight gain was observed in the ovx-hf group followed by the sham-hf and ovxtable 1. obesity-related indices showing effects of ovariectomy andor high-fat hf diet on the mouse phenotype.final body weight gtotal white fat mass g100 g body weighttriglyceride mgdltotal cholesterol mgdlhdl-cholesterol mgdlldl-cholesterola mgdlai bcrf csham29.96 - 2.130.962 - 0.47345.3 - 13.665.5 - 23.345.7 - 5.030.9 - 5.10.4341.434ovx41.44 - 1.526.559 - 0.96752.6 - 7.782.2 - 13.749.7 - 5.745.1 - 9.10.6551.655sham-hf53.13 - 3.8810.33 - 2.0756.6 - 5.3105.7 - 25.339.8 - 2.678.0 - 4.41.658 2.658ovx-hf57.54 - 3.8411.94 - 1.6968.7 - 10.4128.6 - 26.644.7 - 3.695.7 - 12.3 1.880 2.880data are presented as the mean - standard error p  0.05 vs. sham group p  0.05 vs. ovx group.ldl-cholesterol  total cholesterol - hdl-cholesterol - triglyceride  5.ai atherogenic index  total cholesterol - hdl-cholesterol  hdl-cholesterol.crf cardiac risk factor  total cholesterol  hdl-cholesterol.groups.
