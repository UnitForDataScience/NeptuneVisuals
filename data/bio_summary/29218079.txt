the comparisons of dai macroscopic scores weight loss score and inflammatory markers were performed usingmice treated with 2 dss were hemoccult pos- itive on day 3 and displayed more severe bloody diarrhea on day 5. as shown in figure 2 the dai significantly reduced in ad-vegf-c treated mice compared with in dss mice p0.05 2.00-0.16 vs 2.74-0.23 especiallyon days 7 15 22 25 and 27 p0.01 0.040.01 0.00 and 0.01 respectively.mice in dss group showed more severe histo- logical damage damage to crypt architecture cellular infiltration goblet cell depletion and submucosal edema compared with normal mice figure 3a-c. however mice in ad-vegf-c group showed attenuated histological damage compared with mice in dss group figure 3d p0.023 4.78-0.44 vs 6.32-0.25. therewere mild loss of crypt structure and eroded epithelium in the colon of ad-vegf-c treated mice compared to mice in dss group.vegf-c treatment modulated lymphatic ves- sels and lymphatic drainagein figure 4 the lymphatic vessels after vegf-c treatment were enlarged and tortuous and mainly located in the mucosa and lamina pro- pria.

the primers for vegf-c we- re 5'-gtgcatgaacaccagcacgag-3' forward and 5'-tccagcatccgaggaaaaca-3' reverse.the relative mrna expression of vegf-c was normalized to that of human gapdh which was measured with following primers 5'-gg- gtgtgaaccatgagaagtatg-3' forward and 5'-gatggcatggactgtggtcat-3' reverse.dss-induced cc and groupingcc was induced by drinking 2 dss mw 36000-50000 mp biomedical ad libitum for 5 days and then mice drunk dss free water for another 5 days for 3 cycles figure 1. dss water was freshly prepared every day.

both chao and sobs index in vegf-c treated mice markedly decreased as compared to dss group a b. shannon index was comparable between the groups c. pcoa indicates samples in vegf-c group blue clustered together and could be differentiated from those in dss group red d. rarefaction curves tended to reach the plateau e.higher abundance in ad-vegf-c group.

methods mouse cc model was established by three cycles of 2 dss administration for 5 days following water administration for 5 days.

results ad-vegf-c treatment significantly reduced colon inflammation elevated the increase in lymph drainage decreased cd68 macrophages and cd3 t cells th9 cells reduced il-9 and increased il-17 in colon mucosa when compared with dss mice.

cc model was induced in mice by administration of dextran sodium sul- fate dss a total of 34 female c57bl6 mice aged 8-12 weeks were purchased from the shanghai laboratory animal center shanghai china.

histological exami- nation was independently performed by two patholo- gists blind to the study 11.figure 1. schematic chart of study design.mice in dss group n12 were injected with ad-egfp.

a value of p0.05 was con- sidered statistically significant.resultsvegf-c alleviated dai and histological score in cc micefigure 2. ad-vegf-c alleviates colon inflammation lower dai scores in mice with dss-induced cc as compared to dss group on days 7 15 22 25 and27.

differences in alpha- diversity among vegf-c group dss group and control group were determined using spss v.20 ibm armonk ny usa.

the statistical analysis lefse 17 was used to identify the significant difference in gut microbiota between vegf-c group and dss group.statistical analysisall data are expressed as mean - standard de- viation sd.

phylum level percentage was compared among vegf-c group dss group and control group by wilcoxon rank-sum test using spss version 20 ibm armonk ny usa.

there was no significant difference in lvd between ad-vegf-c group and dss group a-d 19.22-0.80 to 17.34-0.97 p0.05.

howeverthe ad-vegf-c-treated mice had significantly larger lymphatic vessels and increased lvd as compared to mice in dss group e 19.22-0.80 to 17.34-0.97 198.0-11.22 to 163.4-7.67 p0.038.to investigate the effect of vegf-c on lymphat- ic drainage in cc evans blue dye was injected and detected in the distant colonic mucosa.

results revealed that lymphatic drainage increased in ad-vegf-c treated mice as com- pared to mice in dss group figure 5 1.85-0.50 vs 1.34-0.17 p0.042.figure 5. lymph flow increases in the colon after ad- vegf-c treatment in cc.

ad-vegf-c treated mice had increased lymph flow as compared to mice in dss group.
