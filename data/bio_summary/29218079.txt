The primers for VEGF-C we- re 5'-GTGCATGAACACCAGCACGAG-3' forward and 5'-TCCAGCATCCGAGGAAAACA-3' reverse.The relative mRNA expression of VEGF-C was normalized to that of human GAPDH which was measured with following primers 5'-GG- GTGTGAACCATGAGAAGTATG-3' forward and 5'-GATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCAT-3' reverse.DSS-induced CC and groupingCC was induced by drinking 2 DSS MW 36000-50000 MP Biomedical ad libitum for 5 days and then mice drunk DSS free water for another 5 days for 3 cycles Figure 1.

As shown in Figure 2 the DAI significantly reduced in AD-VEGF-C treated mice compared with in DSS mice P0.05 2.00-0.16 vs 2.74-0.23 especiallyon days 7 15 22 25 and 27 P0.01 0.040.01 0.00 and 0.01 respectively.Mice in DSS group showed more severe histo- logical damage damage to crypt architecture cellular infiltration goblet cell depletion and submucosal edema compared with normal mice Figure 3A-C.

Both Chao and Sobs index in VEGF-C treated mice markedly decreased as compared to DSS group A B. Shannon index was comparable between the groups C. PCoA indicates samples in VEGF-C group blue clustered together and could be differentiated from those in DSS group red D. Rarefaction curves tended to reach the plateau E.higher abundance in AD-VEGF-C group.

Methods Mouse CC model was established by three cycles of 2 DSS administration for 5 days following water administration for 5 days.

Results AD-VEGF-C treatment significantly reduced colon inflammation elevated the increase in lymph drainage decreased CD68 macrophages and CD3 T cells Th9 cells reduced IL-9 and increased IL-17 in colon mucosa when compared with DSS mice.

CC model was induced in mice by administration of dextran sodium sul- fate DSS A total of 34 female C57BL6 mice aged 8-12 weeks were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center Shanghai China.

DSS water was freshly prepared every day.

Schematic chart of study design.mice in DSS group n12 were injected with AD-EGFP.

Ad-VEGF-C alleviates colon inflammation lower DAI scores in mice with DSS-induced CC as compared to DSS group on days 7 15 22 25 and27.

Differences in alpha- diversity among VEGF-C group DSS group and control group were determined using SPSS v.20 IBM Armonk NY USA.
