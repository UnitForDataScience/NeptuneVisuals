arabiensis to VOCs pro- duced by skin bacteria from three different host species or from previously tested species of bacteria Verhulst et al.

gambiae prefers bloodmeals from selected host species Verhulst et al.

2004 whereas Staphylococcus species which are also very abundant on human skin Council et al.

Both mosquito species can distinguish between volatiles from bacteria collected from different host species and respond differently to volatiles from individual species of skin bacteria.

gambiae for human skin bacteria was also shown in previous semi-field experiments Verhulst et al.

gambiae to skin rubbings of the same hosts tested in a similar set-up Busula et al.

To confirm this and to find other common skin bacterial volatiles that mediate host pref- erence a next step would be to determine the volatile profiles of different groups of hosts by gas chromatography-mass spec- trometry and in addition to define their bacterial profiles by 16S rRNA sequencing.In this study skin bacterial samples were taken from specific parts of the human cow and chicken body which will have influenced the bacterial composition of the samples Grice et al.

Follow-up experiments in a field setting in which mosquitoes of different populations with different host preferences occur should further confirm the roles of skin bacterial volatiles in host selection.The experiment with individual species of bacteria showed that the two mosquito species respond differently to volatiles from bacteria that are common on human and animal skin.

2016 although the host preferences of these species vary among populations and geographic areas Bogh et al.

Different bacteria species produce different subsets of VOCs Verhulst et al.
