The fragment ion at mz 135.0457 was formed from loss of CO2 44 Da Figure 3.2.8  Identification of metabolites of ICQA in rat blood feces urine and gut floraM1 includes isomers detected at 4.67 6.26 and 5.88 min respec- tively.

The fragment ion at mz 121.0660 was 2 Da moreWANG ET AL.5 of 10FIGURE 1 Extracted ion chromatograms for metabolites of isochlorogenic acid A ICQA in rat in negative ion modethan 119 suggesting that di-hydrogen was added.

Metabolite identification was performed with MetabolitePilot1.5 Sciex CA USA based on accurate measurements of the mz values automatically eliminating the interfering peaks after comparing post-acquisition data of the analytes with those of the control and gen- erating lists of metabolites.

A total of32 metabolites were detected from bio-samples including 16 1920 and eight metabolites detected in rat plasma feces urine and gut microbiota respectively Table 1.

Therefore M4 M5 and M6 were proposed to be methylated product of ICQA CA and CQA respectively.M7 with a retention time of 5.67 min displayed an accurate M - H- at mz 181.0508 which is 2 Da more than CA.

The transformation of ICQA in the gut microbi- ota was assessed and the pharmacokinetic profiles of metabolites detected in plasma were followed.

The gra- dient elution started from 2 B for 1 min increased linearly to 8 B over 2 min increased from 8 to 15 B from 3 to 6 min and from 15 to 80 B from 6 to 19 min after holding the composition at 80 B for the next 3.5 min the mobile phase composition returned to 2 B and was maintained for 7 min for column equilibration.The HPLC system was coupled with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry LCMS-Triple TOFtm 5600 SCIEX Foster City CA USA equipped with an electrospray ionizationTABLE 1 Characterization of ICQA metabolites in rats and gut micobiota by HPLCQ-TOF MSM3b5.87C7H12O6191.0559-1.285.0289HydrolysisPM - H- Deprotonated molecule.aP represents the plasma samples U represents the urine samples F refers to the fecal sample G refers to Gut microbiota and Glu refers to glucuronic acid conjugation.bConfirmed using references.interface.

Results and discussionThe metabolites of ICQA in rat plasma urine and feces samples were characterized using a HPLCQ-TOF MS method.
