the proposed metabolic pathway of icqa in rats is presented in figure 2. mass spectral fragmentation of icqathe characterization of chromatographic and mass spectrometric properties of icqa m0 was studied which could provide a structural template for interpreting the metabolites.

metabolite identification was performed with metabolitepilot1.5 sciex ca usa based on accurate measurements of the mz values automatically eliminating the interfering peaks after comparing post-acquisition data of the analytes with those of the control and gen- erating lists of metabolites.

a total of32 metabolites were detected from bio-samples including 16 1920 and eight metabolites detected in rat plasma feces urine and gut microbiota respectively table 1. the structures of the metab- olites were characterized based on the accurate mass measure- ments ms2 fragmentation patterns and chromatographic retention times.

the transformation of icqa in the gut microbi- ota was assessed and the pharmacokinetic profiles of metabolites detected in plasma were followed.

the gra- dient elution started from 2 b for 1 min increased linearly to 8 b over 2 min increased from 8 to 15 b from 3 to 6 min and from 15 to 80 b from 6 to 19 min after holding the composition at 80 b for the next 3.5 min the mobile phase composition returned to 2 b and was maintained for 7 min for column equilibration.the hplc system was coupled with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry lcms-triple toftm 5600 sciex foster city ca usa equipped with an electrospray ionizationtable 1 characterization of icqa metabolites in rats and gut micobiota by hplcq-tof msm3b5.87c7h12o6191.0559-1.285.0289hydrolysispm - h- deprotonated molecule.ap represents the plasma samples u represents the urine samples f refers to the fecal sample g refers to gut microbiota and glu refers to glucuronic acid conjugation.bconfirmed using references.interface.
