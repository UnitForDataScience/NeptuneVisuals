Scientists now believe that the microbiota and all that it involves may be a way to treat any number of disorders including Parkinson's disease and depression.Over the past few years the gut microbiota has been implicated in developmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease andParkinson's disease mood disorders such as depression and even addiction disorders.

The microbiota that we initially develop is determined by the mode of birth delivery of the infant vaginally or by caesarean section diet and exposure to antibioticsIthas been shown that the core microbiota of aged individuals is characteristically distinct from that of younger adults and that age-related shifts in its composition and diversity are linked to adverse health effects in the elderly.

If germ free alpha-synuclein overexpressing animals are given a humanized microbiota from a patient with PD the emergency of pathology is far greater than those transplanting with the microbiota from a healthy subject.

Such findings raise the exciting possibility that changes in the gut microbiota may be used as a diagnostic marker though further large-scale studies are required.Mazmanian's grouphave investigated the genesis of PD features in mice genetically engineered to overexpress alpha-synuclein which go on to develop features of PD.

Gut microbiota are related to Parkinson's disease and clinical phenotype.

It is certain that because of this structural difference with most other brain parts the hypothalamus can be influenced by molecules in the blood which do not gain access to the brain elsewhere.Linking Parkinson's and MicrobiotaSymptoms of Parkinson's disease PD--the shaking palsy--may have been first described by the Greek physician Galen who worked in ancient Rome.

It now seems strange that for so many decades we viewed the gut microbiota as bacteria that did us no harm but were of little benefit.

This erroneous view has been radically transformed into the belief that the gut microbiota is in effect a virtual organ of immense importance.What we've learned is that what is commonly referred to as the brain-gut-microbiota axis is a bidirectional system that enables gut microbes to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate back to the gut.

It may be hard to believe that the microbes in the gut collectively weigh around three pounds--the approximate weight of the adult human brain--and contain ten times the number of cells in our bodies and over 100 times as many genes as our genomeIf the essential microbial genes were to be incorporated into our genomes it is likely that our cells would not be large enough for the extra DNA.Many of those genes in our microbiota are important for brain development and function they enable gut bacteria to synthesize numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators such as g- aminobutyric acid GABA serotonin dopamine and short-chain fatty acids.

While some of these compounds act locally in the gut many products of the microbiota are transported widely and are necessary for the proper functioning of diverse organs.
