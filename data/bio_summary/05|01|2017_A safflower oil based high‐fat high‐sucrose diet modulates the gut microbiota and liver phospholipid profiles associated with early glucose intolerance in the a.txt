2014-15-2934-01027.Indirect calorimetryAfter 4 wk on diets and a 3-day acclimatization period activity O2 and CO2 gas exchange measurements were determined for a 72-h period as previously described 29.Insulin and glucose tolerance testSeparate groups n  5 experiment repeated once of mice were used for insulin and glucose tolerance tests.

8D no differences were found between the diets indicating that dif- ferences in SCFAs in the gut did not contribute to glucose intolerance.DiscussionReports on glucose intolerance in the absence of insulin re- sistance are sparse although this phenotype has previouslybeen observed in mice fed a HFHS diet with a high pro- teincarbohydrate ratio 29 and in mice with impaired in- flammatory responses preventing high-fat diet-induced adi- pose tissue expansion 14.

In contrast Mucispirillum has been associated with high-fat diets and glucose intolerance 36 but since we only observed late changes in this genus it seems unlikely to be the cause of early induction of glucose intolerance.

Compared to the low-fatlow-sucrose diet intake of the safflower-based HFHS diet only led to moderate weight gain while glucose intolerance developed at week 5 prior to signs of inflammation but concurrent with increased levels of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid in hepatic phospholipids.

Conclusion We suggest that a diet-dependent increase in the n-6 to omega-3 n-3 PUFA ratio in hepatic phospholipids together with gut microbiota changes contributed to early development of glucose intolerance without signs of inflammation.Keywordsglucose intolerance  hepatic lipid metabolism  inflammation  leucocytes  saf- flower oilAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived June 23 2016Revised November 15 2016Accepted December 12 2016Correspondence Niels Banhos Danneskiold-SamsoeE-mail Abbreviations Cpt1a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A eWAT epididymal white adipose tissue FCS Fetal calf serum HFHS high-fathigh-sucrose HOMA-IR homeostatic model assess-ment LFLS low-fatlow-sucrose n-3 omega-3 n-6 omega-6TNF-aTnfa tumor necrosis factor aAdditional corresponding author Susanne BrixE-mail Additional corresponding author Karsten KristiansenE-mail These authors contributed equally to this work.IntroductionDuring several decades vegetable oils were regarded as healthier than saturated fats and intake of omega-6 n-6 PUFA increased following recommendations by health au- thorities and because of the increased use of vegetable oil for animal feed 1.

Consequently little is known as to how prolonged high intake of n-6 PUFAs affects metabolism glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity and systemic low-grade inflammation.In general high-fathigh-glycemic carbohydrate rich diets are associated with low-grade systemic inflammation which decreases insulin sensitivity 11-13.

Such mice display increased ectopic fat deposition in the liver associated with glucose intol- erance 1415.

Additionally diet-induced changes of the gut microbiota can activate inflammatory pathways resulting in insulin resistance and dysregulated glucose homeostasis 19 20.

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of diets in regulation of the gut microbiota composition 21 22 which in turn modulate host lipid metabolism including liver lipid profiles 23 and host glucose metabolism 24 25.
