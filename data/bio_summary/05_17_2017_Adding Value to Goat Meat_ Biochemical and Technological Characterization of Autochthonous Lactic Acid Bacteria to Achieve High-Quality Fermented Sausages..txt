this work is among the few studies focused on the development of a starter culture for goat-meat-based sausages that could be an efficient alternative to improve the production process while preserving typicity and guaranteeing the quality and safety of the final product.ongoing studies will evaluate the hygienic and sensory quality of goat meat fermented sausages madewith the selected lab in combination with a selected gcc.finally this work constitutes an important contribution for boosting regional meat industries by creating new added-value fermented products based on meat from culled goats and creating other choices for marketing.supplementary materials the following are available online at  table s1 growth and acidification ability of lactobacillus isolates in the goat meat model system mms at 30 c after 24 h.acknowledgments this research was supported by funds from cicyt-unse ciunt26d429 secyt pict2011 0175 and conicet pip2015-0530.author contributions miriam t. nediani soledad lopez alzogaray and silvina fadda conceived and designed the experiments miriam t. nediani luis garcia and lucila saavedra performed the experiments miriam t. nediani silvina fadda sandra martinez and soledad lopez alzogaray analyzed the data sandra martinez soledad lopez alzogaray and silvina fadda contributed reagentsmaterialsanalysis tools miriam t. nediani silvina fadda soledad lopezalzogaray and lucila saavedra wrote the paper.conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest.referencesmadruga m.s.

on this basis the aims of this study were i to produce artisanal goat meat fermented sausages ii to evaluate their quality and safety and iii to isolate identify and characterize autochthonous lactobacillus strains from the obtained fermented products.

the lowest values of l and b c and h were for sausages made exclusively with goat meat formulation a. these values are consistent with the composition of the sausages as it is known that goat meat is darker than pork meat due to a higher concentration of pigment .

the microbial evolution observed confirms the findings of several authors who reported that lab and gcc are microorganisms very well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions that develop during the production of dry cured sausages .microorganisms related to food spoilage and food-borne illnessamong the non-desirable microbiota minimal contents of coliforms at 45 c and absence of salmonella were registered in all sausages along the ripening period indicating the adequate quality of the raw materials.

in the present study spontaneously fermented goat meat sausages were created and analyzed using a physicochemical and microbiological approach.

in fact the use of processes such as saltingmicroorganisms 2017 5 26 doismoking and air-drying was the oldest way to preserve raw materials however its significance has recently increased as a way of transforming and diversifying meat products .in order to improve the hygienic and sensory properties of fermented sausages starter cultures are usually applied in industrial-scale processing.

the hygienic and technological properties of isolates were evaluated in order to design an autochthonous starter culture capable of improving safety while preserving the typical sensory characteristic of traditional goat meat sausages produced in santiago del estero northwest argentina.materials and methodspreparation of fermented sausage and samplingthe goat meat used in this study came from creole x boer castrated animals provided by the instituto nacional de tecnologia agropecuaria--inta santiago del estero argentina with average live weights of 25 to 27 kg.
