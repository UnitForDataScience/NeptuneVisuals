This work is among the few studies focused on the development of a starter culture for goat-meat-based sausages that could be an efficient alternative to improve the production process while preserving typicity and guaranteeing the quality and safety of the final product.Ongoing studies will evaluate the hygienic and sensory quality of goat meat fermented sausages madewith the selected LAB in combination with a selected GCC.Finally this work constitutes an important contribution for boosting regional meat industries by creating new added-value fermented products based on meat from culled goats and creating other choices for marketing.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at  Table S1 Growth and acidification ability of Lactobacillus isolates in the goat meat model system MMS at 30 C after 24 h.Acknowledgments This research was supported by funds from CICyT-UNSE CIUNT26D429 SECyT PICT2011 0175 and CONICET PIP2015-0530.Author Contributions Miriam T.

L. sakei strains are proposed as optimal candidates to improve the production of fermented goat meat sausages creating a new added-value fermented product.Keywords goat meat meat fermentation fermented sausages lactic acid bacteria starter cultures food quality food safetyIntroductionGoat meat represents an important part of food consumption and is one of the main components of several traditional dishes in the Mediterranean diet .

The pH values achieved in both formulations were similar to fermented sausages from France Spain and Italy .Regarding aw evolution the lowest value was also achieved in sausages from formulation A 0.82 some authors found at the end of maturation aw  0.83  while  found higher values in low-acid fermented sausages aw 0.93.Table 1.

On this basis the aims of this study were i to produce artisanal goat meat fermented sausages ii to evaluate their quality and safety and iii to isolate identify and characterize autochthonous Lactobacillus strains from the obtained fermented products.

The artisan fermented sausage was prepared using two different formulations and following the methodology described by .

The results presented herein are in agreement with those previously published on the identification and characterization of LAB in Italian  Spanish  French  and Greek  naturally fermented beefpork sausages.Table 4.

The medium was distributed into plates and 10 uL of each culture were spread onto agar plates incubated at 30 C for 48 h. The appearance of a clear zone around the colonies was considered as an indicator for pork-fat lipolysis.

The homogenate was centrifuged 14000x g 20 min at 4 C. The meat model system MMS consisted of the supernatant containing the sarcoplasmic proteins which was filtered through Whatman paper filter-sterilized through a 0.22 um-pore-size filter Steritop GP Biopore Buenos Aires Argentina and supplemented with 0.5 glucose and 0.01 Tween 80 according to .
