however based on recent evidence dif- ferences in proinflammatory polarization of innate immune cells and the local microenvironment between the nod col- onies of the two studies may in addition critically impinge on local t reg cell induction potential and thereby on outcomes of antigen-specific therapy and disease prevention efficacy kto broaden the window of subimmunogenic ligand ap- plication and to increase robustness at a given antigen dose we also had used a combination of insulin peptide applica- tion together with the mtor inhibitor everolimus this combination showed superior effects also on insulitis scores approaches that can inhibit the signaling intermediates of t cell activation and or strategies that can impact b cellmetabolic function com-bined with antigenic application therefore may functionto strengthen the robustness of treatment outcomes k in summarywe previously concluded that a a strong ag- onistic insulin mimetope induces stronger t cell proliferation and b when provided under appropriate subimmunogenic conditions is superior in inducing foxp3 t reg cells when compared with insulin b9-23.we also found that c the com- bination of the insulin-mimetope at subimmunogenic doses with the mtor inhibitor everolimus is superior in inducing foxp3t reg cells that d at an appropriate subimmunogenic dose the insulin mimetope can prevent progression of diabetes development and that e the combination of antigenic ther-apy together with mtor inhibition strengthens the tolerizing potential of t reg cell induction in nod mice and reveals superior effects also on insulitis scores recent experiments by confirm the notion d that individual subimmunogenic ligand dose identification for t reg cell conversion supports efficient tol- erance induction and thereby can impact disease outcomes.

several independent studies originally demonstrated that a strong-agonistic ligand provided under subimmunogenic conditions results in effi- cient conversion of naive cd4 t cells into foxp3 t reg cells we have previously reported that a strong-agonistic variant of a weak-agonistic insulin epitope provided under appropriate subimmunogenic conditions conferred efficient insulin-specific t reg cell induction in nonobese diabetic nod mice despite this and given our growing appreciation regarding the complexity and het- erogeneity of immune activation processes in type 1 diabetes t1d it appears reasonable to argue that t reg cell induction per se cannot be equated to efficacy of t1d prevention in nod mice.in the study by bergman et al.

accordingly it has been proposed that efficient t reg cell induction requires individual optimizations of ligand dose in a given experimental environment and is supported by the assessment of naive versus activated cd4 t cells before an- tigen application because activated cd4 t cells are resistant to foxp3t reg cell conversion.therefore the observation by that already the weak-agonistic insu- lin b9-23 peptide promotes a disease worsening might sug- gest that in these experimental conditions the overall setting might be predisposed to immune activation besides the auto- immune nod phenotype per se.concerning antigen application by osmotic mini-pumps in our previous study control animals were not left unma- nipulated as erroneously assumed by but were implanted with pumps filled with vehicle to match treatment conditions.

the other dis- coveries and conclusions we reported were not addressed by these authors but independently shown by several studies using different models and animal facilities.more mechanistic studies are required to gain an im- proved understanding of how antigen application for the effi- cient and stable induction of t reg cells can be best achieved in the setting of t1d pcombinatorial strate- gies inhibiting the signaling intermediates of t cell activation might help to increase the robustness of tolerance induction to reduce t1d incidence vacknowledgmentsc.

in autoimmune arthritis  therefore evidence that specific elements of the microbiota impinge on peripheral t reg cell induction and on autoimmune activation is beginning to emerge and could also contribute to the observed different outcomes between the two studies discussed here.used the analysis of insulin auto-antibodies to assess autoimmune activation in the respective nod mouse colony.

here we provide a response to these data and suggest that appropriate subimmunogenic conditions are required to induce foxp3 regulatory t cell conversion.foxp3 regulatory t t reg cells are important for the es- tablishment of immunological tolerance.

the application of the weak-agonistic insulin b9-23 peptide promotes significant disease worsening suggesting that ther- apeutic application of such an approach during ongoing islet autoimmunity can be prone to undesired consequences.given a setting prone to autoimmune activation as in t1d one important challenge for efficient t reg cell conver- sion is to maintain appropriate subimmunogenic conditions which are critically influenced by antigen dose and activation status of antigen-presenting cells and t cells as well as by intrinsic t cell sen- sitivity to antigenic stimulation.
