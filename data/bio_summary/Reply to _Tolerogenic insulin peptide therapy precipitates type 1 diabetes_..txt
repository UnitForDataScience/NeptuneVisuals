Several independent studies originally demonstrated that a strong-agonistic ligand provided under subimmunogenic conditions results in effi- cient conversion of naive CD4 T cells into Foxp3 T reg cells We have previously reported that a strong-agonistic variant of a weak-agonistic insulin epitope provided under appropriate subimmunogenic conditions conferred efficient insulin-specific T reg cell induction in nonobese diabetic NOD mice Despite this and given our growing appreciation regarding the complexity and het- erogeneity of immune activation processes in type 1 diabetes T1D it appears reasonable to argue that T reg cell induction per se cannot be equated to efficacy of T1D prevention in NOD mice.In the study by Bergman et al.

However based on recent evidence dif- ferences in proinflammatory polarization of innate immune cells and the local microenvironment between the NOD col- onies of the two studies may in addition critically impinge on local T reg cell induction potential and thereby on outcomes of antigen-specific therapy and disease prevention efficacy KTo broaden the window of subimmunogenic ligand ap- plication and to increase robustness at a given antigen dose we also had used a combination of insulin peptide applica- tion together with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus This combination showed superior effects also on insulitis scores Approaches that can inhibit the signaling intermediates of T cell activation and or strategies that can impact b cellmetabolic function com-bined with antigenic application therefore may functionto strengthen the robustness of treatment outcomes K In summarywe previously concluded that a a strong ag- onistic insulin mimetope induces stronger T cell proliferation and b when provided under appropriate subimmunogenic conditions is superior in inducing Foxp3 T reg cells when compared with insulin B9-23.We also found that c the com- bination of the insulin-mimetope at subimmunogenic doses with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is superior in inducing Foxp3T reg cells that d at an appropriate subimmunogenic dose the insulin mimetope can prevent progression of diabetes development and that e the combination of antigenic ther-apy together with mTOR inhibition strengthens the tolerizing potential of T reg cell induction in NOD mice and reveals superior effects also on insulitis scores Recent experiments by confirm the notion d that individual subimmunogenic ligand dose identification for T reg cell conversion supports efficient tol- erance induction and thereby can impact disease outcomes.

The other dis- coveries and conclusions we reported were not addressed by these authors but independently shown by several studies using different models and animal facilities.More mechanistic studies are required to gain an im- proved understanding of how antigen application for the effi- cient and stable induction of T reg cells can be best achieved in the setting of T1D PCombinatorial strate- gies inhibiting the signaling intermediates of T cell activation might help to increase the robustness of tolerance induction to reduce T1D incidence vAcknowlEdgMEnTsC.
