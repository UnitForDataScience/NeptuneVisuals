This activates several death-signaling proteins such as calcium-dependent proteases lipases and DNases resulting in cell death in the ischemic core .One reason for the particular susceptibility of the brain to ischemic injury is that brain tissue contains high levels of glutamate and many neurons in the brain are activated by glutamate receptors.

While the initial purpose of microglial activation is the brain's effort to protect neurons the over-activation of microglia results in deleterious inflammation increasing the probability of neuronal death -.Previously it was accepted that blood brain barrier BBB prevented blood inflammatory cells monocytes and neutro- phils from entering the brain and the predominant opinion was that only microglial cells were involved in inflammation of the brain.
