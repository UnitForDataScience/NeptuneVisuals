This activates several death-signaling proteins such as calcium-dependent proteases lipases and DNases resulting in cell death in the ischemic core .One reason for the particular susceptibility of the brain to ischemic injury is that brain tissue contains high levels of glutamate and many neurons in the brain are activated by glutamate receptors.

While the initial purpose of microglial activation is the brain's effort to protect neurons the over-activation of microglia results in deleterious inflammation increasing the probability of neuronal death -.Previously it was accepted that blood brain barrier BBB prevented blood inflammatory cells monocytes and neutro- phils from entering the brain and the predominant opinion was that only microglial cells were involved in inflammation of the brain.

In addition inhibition of caspase 3 gene deletions of Bid and the use of viral vector-mediated gene transfer of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are approaches that are identified to be neuroprotec- tive -.A summary of the most important genes involved in neu- ronal degradation and neuronal protection following ischemic stroke is provided in Tables and .Intracranial atherosclerosis and ischemic strokeSeveral lines of evidence show that intracranial atherosclerosis is a common cause of ischemic stroke -.

Therefore in cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury the role of B lympho- cytes might be protective rather than pathogenic.The gut microbiota and ischemic strokeRecent studies demonstrated that antibiotic-induced alter- ations in the intestinal flora reduce ischemic brain injury in mice.

Furthermore the rate of progression of atherosclerosis can be affected by the gut microbiota   and gut microbes can modify important factors in hemo- stasis and thrombosis including platelet responsiveness and clot formation .Future therapiesDespite progress in understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms of ischemic stroke over the last few decadesTable 1Specific genes involved in neurodegeneration following ischemic strokeNR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NMDAR subunit NDC neuronal death-signaling complex AMPAR a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid receptor NCX sodium-calcium exchanger mNCX mitochondrial NCX calpains a family of calcium-activated cysteine prote- ases ROS reactive oxygen species NOS nitric oxide synthase RNS reactive nitrative species TNF-a tumor necrosis factor a IL-1b interleukin-1b IL-6 interleukin-6 BBB blood brain barrier CAM cell adhesion molecule NF-kB nuclear factor kappa B IRF 1 interferon regulator factor 1 HIF 1 hypoxia inducible factor 1 MMP matrix metalloproteinases TLR toll-like receptor MTP mitochondrial transition pores Fas tumor necrosis factor receptor Bcl-2 B cell lymphoma 2thrombolytic therapy with t PA and endovascular recannulation are only FDA-approved treatments for acutestroke.

In rats following ischemic stroke NBO administration salvages ischemic brain tissue by diminishing apoptotic cell death.

Data from experimental models showed that lymphocytes in- filtrate the brain immediately after ischemic stroke with neu- trophils migrating into the brain parenchyma immediately af- ter the initial injury followed by macrophages and natural killer cells  -.

While the initial infiltration of immune cells into the ischemic brain exacerbates tissue damage and worsening of neurologi- cal deficits there is a subsequent beneficial effect including the release of cytokines that promote glial scar formation ac- companied by phagocytosis of cellular debris that is essential for effective wound healing .Cytokines and the neuro-inflammatory responseCytokines are key players in the inflammatory mechanism and contribute stroke-related brain injury .

According to the etiologies ischemic stroke can be further classified into four main categories as follows small vessel disease athero-thrombotic cardio-em- bolic and undetermined causes .Following ischemic stroke neurons are deprived of oxygen and energy with detrimental effects on energy-dependent pro- cesses in neuronal cells .
