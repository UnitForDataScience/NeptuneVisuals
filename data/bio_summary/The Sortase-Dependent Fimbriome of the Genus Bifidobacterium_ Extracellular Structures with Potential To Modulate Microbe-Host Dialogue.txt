Notably cross-alignment of all fimAP and fimBQ genes included in the 15 COPGs revealed in addition to high intra-COPG similarity and identity high homology be- tween pilus subunits of different COPGs which is indicative of horizontal gene transfer HGT events see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material described below.

Therefore analysis of the 15 identified COPGs revealed that a small number contain only a CNA domain while others possess both a CNA domain as well as a CBM domain .Genetic comparison of COPGs within the genus Bifidobacterium.

In contrast COPGs 6 and 7 were found in the genomes of bifidobacterial species presentFIG 2 Genetic comparison of COPGs within the genus Bifidobacterium.

Within the predicted SD fimbriome of the genus Bifidobacterium including typical and atypical pilus loci we identified 156 PEL that are shared by different bifidobacterial subspecies and that therefore consti- tute the clusters of orthologous sortase-dependent pilus-encoding genes COPGs described below.

Network anal- yses of the predicted SD fimbriome of the genus Bifidobacterium highlighted that among the identified 15 COPGs cluster 13 as well as clusters 1 and 8 are placed in the central nodes within the reconstructed bifidobacterial pilus-based network .

These results suggest that SD pilus-like structures of bifidobacteria are involved in the interaction with the host and perhaps also with other members of the microbiota.FIG 6 Occurrence of bifidobacterial COPGs and PEL in fecal metagenome and metatranscriptome data sets.

Altogether the phylogenetic inconsistencies GC content deviation and distinctive codon usage indi- cate that elements of the bifidobacterial SD fimbriome similar to the SD fimbriome of other actinobacteria  were acquired through HGT events Table S3.Transcriptional analysis of bifidobacterial pilus-encoding loci.

Nevertheless such different adhesive roles played by the bifidobacterial SD fimbriome might be further influenced by the SD fimbriome or the extracellular structures produced by other members of the gut microbiota.

Such analyses revealed the presence of 15 main interspe- cies groups of PEL named COPGs that were shown to possess 50 sequence identity and were located in the same genomic region see Fig.
