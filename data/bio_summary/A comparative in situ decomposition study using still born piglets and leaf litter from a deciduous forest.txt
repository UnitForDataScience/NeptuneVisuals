Notwithstanding this comparisons between soil micro- bial communities associated with subsurface cadaver and litter decomposition processes remain unexplored.As a result this in situ study was made with stillborn piglets and leaf litter from a decidous oak Quercus robur forest to address the following research questionsDo whole piglets and leaf litter decomposition illicit the same trends or shifts in biodiversity in situ compared to soil controlsDo seasonal variations impact the microbial community compositions and structures as expressed by 16S taxa distributionsExperimental designCarcasses and in situ siteFrozen  20 0C still-born piglets  1.5 kg were sourced from Northumbria Police Ponteland U.K. transported on icepacks re- frozen  20 0C and thawed completely and immediately before the study burials.

Both the control and Q. robur litter soils recorded pH decreases between days 60 control 8.03 - 0.08 leaf litter 8.05 - 0.02 and 150 control 7.61 -0.05 leaf litter 7.70 - 0.05 while the piglet soil showed an earlier fall between days 90 7.96 - 0.09 and 120925208.51581057.5003060901201501802102402707Time days0306090120150180210240270Time daysFig.

Further comparison revealed 97 similarity between the control leaf litter and piglet graves between days 60 and 150 and 98 similarity between the leaf litter and piglet graves on days 60 andThe NMDS showed taxa similarities between the control and experimental soils from day 60 to 150 while differences between the control and experimental gravesoils were observed from day 180 to 270 .

To investigate subsurface microbiome shifts as a novel tool to establish postmortem microbial clock and augment postmortem interval PMI and time-since-burial estimations an in situ study with triplicate underground burials of piglets as human taphonomic proxies and Quercus robur leaf litter was monitored for 270 days.

Furthermore Methylophilaceae Methylophilales order and Anaerolineaceae would differentiate for the piglet and leaf litter soils respectively 180 days after internment.c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.IntroductionA cadaver is an energy resource which plays a role in nutrient cycling with the release of numerous compounds such as acetic acid amino acids and propionic acid into the surrounding soil .

Each of the three 1-m sections  had three pits dug with dimensions of 50 cm length by 30 cm width by 40 cm depth 2 m apart for the control C indigenous oak leaf litter Q. robur L and piglet P. For the piglet burials aluminium wire mesh cages 40 cm long 25 cm wide 15 cm height were fabricated to prevent scavengers from gaining access.

Site configuration of the control C leaf litter L and piglet P burials with all dimensions in metres.

Relationships between soil pH temperature and phyla relative abundance were analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient SCC S3 xlstats 2016.02.27313 New York U.S.A..ResultspH trendsThe average pH values for the control and treatments Sus scrofa domesticus and Q. robur litter soils were compared between day 0 winter December 17 2014 and 270 autumn September 2015  and showed an increase for the S. scrofa domesticus 7.84 0.07 from day 0 to day 30 compared to control 7.86 0.14 and leaf litter 7.80 0.03.

While increases in pH between days 30 and 60 were recorded for the control 8.03 0.08 and leaf litter 8.05 0.02 the S. scrofa domesticus soil decreased 7.92 0.08.
