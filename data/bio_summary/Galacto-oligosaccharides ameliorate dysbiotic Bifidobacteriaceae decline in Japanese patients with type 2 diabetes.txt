In our study GOS restored the abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae in patients with type 2 diabetes and to our knowledge this is the firstreport demonstrating the effectiveness of GOS on the gut microbiota in patients with diabetes.However a 4-week intake of GOS did not have a significant effect on LBP and glucose tolerance in this study.

Compositional differences in gut microbiota between healthy adults and patients with type 2 diabetes have been reported in human studies and gut microbiotas of patients with type 2 diabetes vary by race Karlsson et al.

In the present study we demonstrated that GOS can ameliorate dysbiosis in patients with diabetes and continuous intake of GOS may be a promising method for managing type 2 diabetes.Keywords gut microbiota lipopolysaccharides metabolic endotoxemia prebioticsIntroductionDiabetes is now a worldwide problem and one of its pathologies is insulin resistance caused by systemic low- grade inflammation.

Dendrograms indicate hierarchic structures by cluster analysis.It is known that gut dysbiosis is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes and recently growing numbers of investigations have reported the intestinal microbiota composition of patients with diabetes.

The intestinal microbiota of Japanese patients with diabetes in our study was different from that of the female European patients in Karlsson's study which might be due to differences in race residential area dietary habits and sequencing method.

All 30 control subjects were analysed without exclusion and of the 55 patients with diabetes 52 were analysed GOS group n27 placebo group n25 three patients did not take syrup in compliance with the trial protocol.

Secondly we tested whether GOS ingestion alters gut microbiota and their metabolites in type 2 diabetes in a double-blind controlled trial.Materials and methodsStudy subjectsWe recruited 116 Japanese outpatients with type 2 diabetes to measure their blood LPS and LBP concentrations and then selected 55 patients diabetes group DMG who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria 1 age 20 years or 70 years 2 HbA1c 10 3 malignancy 4 severe infection5 severe liver or renal dysfunction 6 treated with antibiotics 7 treated with a-glucosidase inhibitor aGI.

Fourth this study had a small sample size.In conclusion the results of our study showed that consuming GOS for 4 weeks restored Bifidobacteriaceae abundance in the gut microbiota of patients with diabetes.

Our future work should include a larger and longer interventional study of GOS effects on metabolism and the gut microbiota in patients with diabetes.Supplementary materialSupplementary material can be found online at .Table S1.
