Because the contributions from additional knowledge nearly diminish when the sample size exceeds K 14 30 therefore we focus on the 16 cases from K 14 10 to K 14 30.In terms of co-alignment we design the symmetric weight matrix Ann0 14 1 if contig n and contig n0 are aligned to the same species using the TAXAassign script .

Owing to non-negativity of H kHnk1 stands for the column sum of the n-th column vector of H. The parameter a  0 controls the trade-off between approximation accuracy and the sparseness of H.

A total of 37 628 contigs remain for binning after co-assembly and filtering.strained problems argminH 20kX - WHnk2with constraintThe simulated 'strain' dataset aimed to test the ability of2nFdkHnk1 - 1Th 14 0 where n 14 1    N. The resulting a is denotedCONCOCT to cluster contigs at different levels of taxonomicresolution .

These approaches require similarity measurements from GC content tetra-mer composition     or Interpolated Markov Models  to contig coverage profile  .Recently several methods have been developed to bin contigs using the coverage profiles of the contigs across multiple metage- nomic samples       Wu et al.

The rationale of binning contigs into OTUs relies on the underlying assumption that contigs originating from the same OTU share similar relative abundance as well as sequence composition.Formally we encode the abundance and composition of the k-th OTU by a dM th VTh dimensional feature vector Wk k 14 1 2    K where M is the number of samples V is the number of distinct l-mers and K is the total OTU number.

sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples we show the effectiveness of COCACOLA on simulated 'species' and 'strain' datasets in comparison with three state-of-art methodologically distinct methods for contigs binning CONCOCT  GroopM   MaxBin Wu et al.

The relative abundance profiles of the different speciesstrains for the simulation were based on the HMP samples as well.The simulated 'species' dataset consisted of 101 different species across 96 samples.
