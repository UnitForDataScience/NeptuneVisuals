Reciprocal transplantation of coral colonies between the two thermally distinct environments strikingly demonstrated that coral microbial communities fully adjusted to the new environmental conditions 17 months after transplantation the microbiomes of non-native corals transplanted into each pool could not be distinguished from the microbiomes of the native corals in the same pool ANOSIM HV pool R 0.013 MV pool R 0.005 both P40.05.

Nevertheless while we did not transfer microbiomes between HV and MV corals the long-termtransplantation effectively resulted in HV corals harbouring an MV microbiome and MV corals harbouring an HV microbiome associated with higher and lower susceptibility to coral bleaching respectively.Taxonomy-based functional profiling of the distinct microbial communities of HV and MV corals provided insight into the associated cellular processes underlying the differences in the coral heat stress response.

corals in the same pool harbour the same microbiome irrespective of their pool of origin colonies are referred to as HV and MV corals according to their pool of destination in the following.

a highly variable HV pool and a moderately variable MV pool although under heat stress MV corals bleached irrespective of which symbiont typethey harboured.

5 and 20 h controls and 5 h heat stress revealed that microbial communities of corals from the HV pool had no distinct bacterial indicator taxa while the same treatment group from the MV pool had 10 indicator OTUs that were characteristic of the heat-induced microbial shift in these more susceptible corals 2b.

Experimental replacement of obligate symbionts from corals in the HV pool to corals in the MV pool with a subsequent demonstration of acquired heat tolerance would ultimately demonstrate the effect of host-associated bacteria onhost ecology.

This observation relates well with the significantly higher abundance of Rhodospirillaceae in the HV pool and the identification of indicator bacteria from the genus Inquilinus in the HV pool and thus suggests a possible role of Rhodospirillaceae in the thermal tolerance of the corals.
