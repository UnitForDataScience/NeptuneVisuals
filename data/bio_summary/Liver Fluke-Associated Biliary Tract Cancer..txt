Risk Factors in Patients Presenting with Cholangiocarcinoma9Eastern Asia the incidence of CCA is relatively low in Korea and Japan whereas the incidence rate of CCA in Thailand is extremely high with age-standardized incidence rates of 33.4 per 100000 in men and 12.3 per 100000 in women.7 Known risk factors are established among a minority of patients with CCA Table 1.5 In Western countries the risk of CCA increases in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis whereas liver fluke infection Opisthorchis viverrini Clonorchis sinensis and Schistosomiasis japonica appears to be the major risk factor of CCA in Asian countries.57-9 Exposure to toxic compounds such as Thorotrast has also been related to an increased risk of CCA.9 Further previous series showed several diseases associated with the development of CCA including hepatitis B and C infection cirrhosis obesity and diabetes mellitus.9 In Thailand the high- est percentage of CCA was observed in the north-eastern part where the highest prevalence of O. viverrini was reported in this country.710 Based on the World Health Organization WHO O. viverrini has also been addressed as class I carcinogen.11LIVER FLUKEThe life cycleO.

In Western countries the risk of CCA in- creases in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis whereas liver fluke infection appears to be the major risk factor for CCAin Asian countries.BILE DUCT CANCER CHOLANGIOCARCINOMAClinical presentationsCCA the second most common primary liver cancers is an aggressive cancer arising from malignant transformation of bili- ary epithelial cells.1 Globally CCA accounts for approximately 10 to 20 of primary liver cancers.2 Based on anatomical structures CCA is divided into two subtypes extrahepatic and intrahepatic which accounts for approximately 75 and 25 of all cases respectively.3 Extrahepatic CCA can be further clas- sified into perihilar middle and distal depending on the loca- tions of the tumor.45 The perihilar CCA is further categorized according to the Bismuth-Corlette classification as addressed in the literature.6 The clinical presentations of CCA range from nonspecific symptoms to signs related to late stages of disease.

Most CCA cases presented as unresect- able tumor with stage III or stage IV at the time of diagnosis.3 Therefore CCA is unfortunately associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable treatment outcomes.5Risk factorsDue to differences in risk factors and genetics in various regions the incidence rates of CCA vary geographically.

Correspond- ingly the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ILb-1 and IL-6 were upregulated through NF-kB activation.6465 In a human CCA cell line HuCCT1 study CsESP induced the production of intracellular free radicals through upregulation of TLR signaling transduction.66 In summary these immunopatho- logic mechanisms contribute to CCA development by generating an intense inflammation advanced periductal fibrosis and DNA damage.Parasites' excretorysecretory products-induced cells proliferationThe parasite excretorysecretory products not only triggered immune-mediated inflammation but also played many other roles in the carcinogenesis of CCA Figs 2 and 3.67 In a murine fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 studies OvESP promoted cells proliferation68 and upregulated genes expression in several pathways particularly those involving in epidermal growth fac- tor and transforming growth factor b pathways.69 Data from a proteomic study investigating the entire proteins in OvESP dem- onstrated that OvESP was a complex blend of proteins associ- ated with cancers such as granulin thioredoxin and cystatin.
