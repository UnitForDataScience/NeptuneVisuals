most cca cases presented as unresect- able tumor with stage iii or stage iv at the time of diagnosis.3 therefore cca is unfortunately associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable treatment outcomes.5risk factorsdue to differences in risk factors and genetics in various regions the incidence rates of cca vary geographically.

correspond- ingly the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ilb-1 and il-6 were upregulated through nf-kb activation.6465 in a human cca cell line hucct1 study csesp induced the production of intracellular free radicals through upregulation of tlr signaling transduction.66 in summary these immunopatho- logic mechanisms contribute to cca development by generating an intense inflammation advanced periductal fibrosis and dna damage.parasites' excretorysecretory products-induced cells proliferationthe parasite excretorysecretory products not only triggered immune-mediated inflammation but also played many other roles in the carcinogenesis of cca figs 2 and 3.67 in a murine fibroblast cell line nih-3t3 studies ovesp promoted cells proliferation68 and upregulated genes expression in several pathways particularly those involving in epidermal growth fac- tor and transforming growth factor b pathways.69 data from a proteomic study investigating the entire proteins in ovesp dem- onstrated that ovesp was a complex blend of proteins associ- ated with cancers such as granulin thioredoxin and cystatin.
