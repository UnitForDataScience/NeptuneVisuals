A previ- ous high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon anal- ysis indicated that the bacterial microbiota occupying surfaces of lacustrine Cladophora glomerata displayed high levels of taxonomic and inferred functional diversity including cyanobacteria and other bacterial genera many of which are known to be associated with methane-oxidation nitrogen-fixa- tion and cellulose-degradation Zulkifly et al.

Because multiple methanotrophic bacterial genera possibly reflecting func- tional redundancy were inferred for Cladophora microbiota sampled from the same site in 2011 yet a metagenomic analysis of Cladophora microbiota sampled in 2012 did not reveal this guild we also examined the occurrence of methanotrophs in 2014.RESULTSEpibiotic bacterial communities sampled from Lake Mendota Wisconsin USA Cladophora glomer- ata at six time points and three microsites during the growing season of 2014 included 57901 total possible OTUs present in 52 separate assemblages of 16S rRNA gene sequenced reads.

Spatiotemporal occurrence of the 30 most abundant bacterial genera can be found in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information.In contrast to null hypotheses of spatial and tem- poral homogeneity analysis of all reads identified as bacterial in origin indicated substantial temporal and spatial variation.

Methanotrophic bacterial genera were inferred to be most abundant at the South microsite through- out the summer of 2014 and in early summer at theDISCUSSIONThe goals of this study were to statistically test the null hypotheses that lacustrine Cladophora glomerata- associated bacterial communities were relatively homogeneous across the growing season of 2014 and that communities were relatively homogenous among relatively close microsites at the same sam- pling locale.

Our observations of bacterial com- munities associated with lacustrine Cladophora dur- ing the growing season of 2014 reveal patterns of change in bacterial genera that might be ecologi- cally significant and thus warrant further investiga- tion.

Even so futureexplorations of interannual variation in Cladophora epibiotic bacterial communities and possible envi- ronmental correlates seem justified in view of poten- tially powerful ecosystem functions such as methanotrophy.Our observation that 30 bacterial genera includ- ing functionally important representatives Zulkifly et al.
