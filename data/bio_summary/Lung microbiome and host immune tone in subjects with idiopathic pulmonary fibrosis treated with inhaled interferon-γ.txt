the presence of comorbid conditions such as emphysema and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease may impact the lower airway microbiome and negatively affect prognosis in ipf -with the increasing investigation of the lower airway microbiome using culture-independent techniques observational studies have shown that in ipf there is increased bacterial burden and taxonomic differences however the role of the lower airway microbiome in the disease process is poorly understood.few therapies have been shown to change the natural history of ipf.

the data support a tight interaction between the host and the lower airway microbiota in ipf.ipf is a disease of lung injury and aberrant tissue repair where both innate and adaptive immunity play a role in the development of fibrosis the balance between the expression of th1 and th2 cytokines is an important determinant of disease progression in the inflammatory phase of pulmonary fibrosis th1 biomarkers such as ifn-g have been shown to ameliorate the degree of fibrosis in a bleomycin murine model promoting its consideration as potential treatment in this disease however th2 biomarkers such as il-5 have also been shown to potentiate fibrosis in our study the il-5 levels decreased in bal cell supernatants as did some pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers such as il-13 il-17 and pdgf-aa.

multiple correlations between microbial taxa common to the oral mucosa and host inflammatory biomarkers were found.these data suggest that the lung microbiome is independently associated with the host immune tone and may have a potential mechanistic role in ipf.erspublicationslower airway microbiome and immunological tone are associated in ipf an effect independent of ifn-g treatment cite this article as wang j lesko m badri mh et al.

these data suggest that inhaled ifn-g can alter multiple immunological and tissue repair pathways in the lower airway mucosa.with recent advances in culture-independent techniques there has been an increased awareness of the role of the lower airway microbiota in the host's immune response in multiple disease states in ipf it is postulated that chronic microbial colonisation in the lower respiratory tract may contribute to the alveolar epithelial injury potentiating disease progression microbes have been suspected of playing a role in the repetitive alveolar epithelial injury and aberrant wound healing that leads to the fibrotic processbil-12-p40il-6il-9il-1bgm-csftgf-b2butyrivibrio 92512g-csfsil-2rapdgf-aatnfa ifna2il-17staphylococcus 4345285streptococcus 4309301scd40ltgf-b1cxcl9-migvegfil-7pdgf-ab-bb fgf-2il-13parvimonas 851704mcp-1il-5fractalkine gromip-1ail-3neisseriaceaeegf900973il-2tnfbifngil-8 mdcil-10 mip-1b mcp-3ena-78actinomyces 12574il-1rafit-3-ligand rantesbulleidia 851938eotaxinip-10parvimonas851704vegf tnfbmip-1ail-7il-17fractalkineil-15fgf-2mcp-1mip-1bscd40lmcp-3prevotella 4304901g-csfweeksellaceae 887744gm-csfifna2sil-2ra il-2il-8 il-1rabulleidia 851938tnfaifngmdcil-4th1 th2 th17il-12-p70rothia 4411138groegfeotaxinipfp0.05il-5chryseobacterium 3577479il-13fit-3-ligandil-6il-1aip-10pedobacter 862357il-12-p40p0.025p0.01 p0.0075 p0.005figure 3 co-occurrence network between taxa and biomarkers.

in healthy smokers we have shown that a lower airway microbiome enriched with taxa commonly found in the upper airways is associated with a distinct immune profile characterised by a th17 phenotype and a blunted toll-like receptor 4 response we have also noted that this distinct lung microbiome  pneumotypespt for supraglottic predominant taxa is associated with a distinct genomic potential and metabolomic profile.

although contamination with oropharyngeal microbiota can occur during bronchoscopy recent data suggest that sampling artefacts of the lower airway microbial surveys are relatively minor - in this investigation we utilised acellular bal to characterise the lower airway microbiota.

this suggests that while in some subjects their lower airway microbiome remained resilient in other subjects the microbiome underwent multiple changes in taxonomic composition.

in a large multicentre trial staphylococcus and streptococcus were associated with progression of disease in ipf in a double-blind randomised placebo controlled trial cotrimoxazole was given to patients with ipf twice daily for a period of 12 months leading to improvement in quality of life scoring and decreased mortality in our study the diversity of the lower airway microbiota of patients with ipf did not significantly change during treatment with aerosolised ifn-g. however taxonomic composition of the lower airway microbiota was significantly associated with multiple immunological pathways that may play a role in the lung parenchymal injuryrepair process in ipf.

moreover although we included technical controls in sequencing runs bal samples were obtained prior to adapting our protocol for sampling bronchoscopic environmental controls which may also be important for microbiome studies with low biomass samples in summary inhaled ifn-g was associated with small changes in the composition of the lower airway microbiota.

prior comparisons of bal samples from subjects with ipf compared with subjects with normal lungs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd showed that in ipf there is an increase in bacterial burden in the lower airways furthermore there is a direct correlation between this lower airway bacterial burden and the decline in lung function.

here we evaluate whether treatment with aerosolised ifn-g in ipf impacts either the lower airway microbiome or the host immune phenotype.patients with ipf who enrolled in an aerosolised ifn-g trial underwent bronchoscopy at baseline and after 6 months.

taken together these data suggest that the lower airway microbiome is independently associated with the host immune tone and thus may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment of ipf.acknowledgementsauthor contributions conception and design g. smaldone r. condos l.n.

importantly while ifn-g did not significantly change the lower airway microbiota there was a correlation between oral microbes in the lower airways and the inflammatory phenotype both local and systemic.

this suggests that the mucosal inflammatory phenotype is more tightly correlated with lower airway taxa than the systemic inflammatory phenotype.
