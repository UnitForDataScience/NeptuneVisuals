Recognised BRD pathogens were isolated at low frequency M. haemolytica n  2 both isolated from a single maxillary sinus Trueperella pyo- genes 1 maxillary sinus P. multocida 1 caudal frontal sinus and Bibersteinia trehalosi 1 maxillary sinus.

Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the paranasal sinuses of two animals--from three both rostral lateral frotal and one rostral medial frontal sinus and two sinuses caudal frontal sinus and rostral lateral frontal sinus respectively.Bacterial PCRBacterial PCR results are also presented in .

the maxil- lary sinus communicates with the palatine sinus and the lacrimal sinus.

The mucosa of the sinus was swabbed in a circular motion for three seconds at each sinus sampling site n  8 prior to removal of each swab and transportation to the laboratory for immediate processing.

Serum samples were considered positive if their PP value was greater than or equal to 10.Immunohistochemistry IHC for the detection of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase iNOSHistopathological examination and IHC for iNOS detection was performed on 5mm-thick sec- tions of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded bovine sinus mucosa from the caudal frontal sinus mounted on glass slides Superfrost Plus Fischer Scientific Dublin Ireland.

The relative frequency of detection of antibodies to BPIV-3 and BRSV in serum and the relative frequency of detection of selected viral and bacterial BRD-causing pathogens in the trachea and lungs of the study population.doi10.1371journal.pone.0173845.t002a b and c Photomicrographs of bovine paranasal sinus epithelium with positive red immunohistochemical staining of epithelial cells a and b denoting expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and of the negative control c aX10 b X40 c X40.doi10.1371journal.pone.0173845.g002DiscussionThis is the first study to document the microbial flora of the bovine paranasal sinuses and to demonstrate the expression of NO by the sinus epithelium.

Lundberg and colleagues  reported that the NOS present in the paranasal sinus mucosa of humans was identical to iNOS and was calcium-independent but its regula- tion in the paranasal sinus appeared to be fundamentally different from iNOS found in inflamed tissue or activated white blood cells as it was constantly expressed was not downre- gulated by glucocorticoids and behaved similarly to constitutive NOS.

BPIV-3 was detected by PCR in the sinus of only one animal while BRSV was not detected in the sinus of any animal suggesting that the persistence ofBRD-causing viruses is unlikely in the sinuses.

To further explore these findings we investigated the potential role of the antimicrobial molecule nitric oxide NO within paranasal sinus epithelium using immunohistochemistry.

Expression of the enzyme responsible for NO synthesis inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS was detected to vary- ing degrees in 76.5 of a sub-sample of animals suggesting production of this compound plays a similar protective role in the bovine sinus as it does in humans.IntroductionThe bovine paranasal sinuses are a group of complex cavernous air-filled spaces lined by respi- ratory epithelium which develop by evagination of the nasal mucosa into spongy bone between the external and internal laminae of the cranial and facial bones of the bovine skull .
