zero offspring production Male strain F175 14 12.641 p  0.001 whereby females mating with AP-infected males were more likely to have zero offspring production than females mating with LP- infected males c. When females that failed to pro- duce offspring were removed from the analysis there was no effect of either male strain F162 14 0.413 p 14 0.522 female strain F161 14 0.404 p 14 0.527 or their interaction F158 14 0.293 p 14 0.092.

There was also a borderline non-significant interaction Male strain x Female strain on off- spring production Male strain x Female strain F171 14 3.813 p 14 0.054 where mating pairs with LP-infected males and AP-infected females had higher short-term offspring pro- duction b see the electronic supplementary material for full analysis.

The effect of male gut bacteria strain on offspring production of the mating pair was driven by a higher proportion of females failing to produce any offspring after mating i.e.

We used general linear models for the analyses of female latency to mate and mating duration and generalized linear models for short-term reproduc- tive success and proportion of virgin females that failed to302010b 100755025c4 0.200.150.100.050APLP0male strain AP AP LP LP0APLPmale strainfemale strain AP LPAP LPmale strainmating paird1.51.00.50male strain APAPLPLPAPAPLPLPfemale strain APLPAPLPAPLPAPLPmating pairFigure 2.

Male strain but not female strain of gut bacteria had a significant effect on the duration of mating Male strain F172 14 8.533 p 14 0.004 with mating pairs with LP-infected males mating relatively longer a.

This effect was also seen in offspring production of the mating pair where pairs with LP-infected males had higher offspring production Male strain F172 14 5.152 p 14 0.026 b.

Results show a positive effect of LP strain on reproductive success when present in males relative to males re-inoculated with AP and a negative effect of AP strain on offspring weight when present in both parents rela- tive to LP-inoculated parents.

We found an interaction of Male strain x Female strain on daughters' but not sons' body mass see the electronic supplementary material daughters F1295.7 14 5.487 p 14 0.020 sons F1300.6 14 0.026 p 14 0.873showing that daughters' body mass can be significantly reduced when both the father and the mother are re- inoculated with AP strain compared with the other pairings d .

Among these microorganisms one group is particularly functionally important the bacteria inhabiting the gut In insects gut bacteria have been shown to modulate developmental rate metabolism and nutritional physiology as well as social and sexual interactions For instance previous findings suggest that fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster prefer to mate with partners with gut bacteria composition similar to rather than different from their own--an example of positive assortative homotypic mating  If this choice evolved through evolutionary processes e.g.

in D. melanogaster we predicted shorter latency of females to mate longer mating duration higher offspring production and heavier offspring in homotypic mating treatments relative to heterotypic mating treatments if gut microbiota-induced assortative mating responds plastically or has evolved under sexual and natural selection.Results and DiscussionGerm-free flies of both sexes were re-inoculated with either AP or LP.
