male strain but not female strain of gut bacteria had a significant effect on the duration of mating male strain f172 14 8.533 p 14 0.004 with mating pairs with lp-infected males mating relatively longer a. this effect was also seen in offspring production of the mating pair where pairs with lp-infected males had higher offspring production male strain f172 14 5.152 p 14 0.026 b. there was also a borderline non-significant interaction male strain x female strain on off- spring production male strain x female strain f171 14 3.813 p 14 0.054 where mating pairs with lp-infected males and ap-infected females had higher short-term offspring pro- duction b see the electronic supplementary material for full analysis.

zero offspring production male strain f175 14 12.641 p  0.001 whereby females mating with ap-infected males were more likely to have zero offspring production than females mating with lp- infected males c. when females that failed to pro- duce offspring were removed from the analysis there was no effect of either male strain f162 14 0.413 p 14 0.522 female strain f161 14 0.404 p 14 0.527 or their interaction f158 14 0.293 p 14 0.092. together our results show nodirect evidence for advantages of homotypic mating as 2 suggested previously but suggest that the strain of male gut bacterium is important for mating investment and reproductive success of the mating pair.we then asked whether homotypic and heterotypic mating affected the next generation or if there was also a sex-specific effect of gut microbiota on trans-generational effects of the gut bacteria.

we then mated males and females of all treatments in combinations and measured latency of virgin females to mate as a proxy for male attractiveness mating duration as a proxy for male mating investment short-term 72 h off- spring production as a proxy for reproductive success as well as offspring body mass as a proxy for offspring qual- ity e.g.

the effect of male gut bacteria strain on offspring production of the mating pair was driven by a higher proportion of females failing to produce any offspring after mating i.e.

we found an interaction of male strain x female strain on daughters' but not sons' body mass see the electronic supplementary material daughters f1295.7 14 5.487 p 14 0.020 sons f1300.6 14 0.026 p 14 0.873showing that daughters' body mass can be significantly reduced when both the father and the mother are re- inoculated with ap strain compared with the other pairings d .

results show a positive effect of lp strain on reproductive success when present in males relative to males re-inoculated with ap and a negative effect of ap strain on offspring weight when present in both parents rela- tive to lp-inoculated parents.

in d. melanogaster we predicted shorter latency of females to mate longer mating duration higher offspring production and heavier offspring in homotypic mating treatments relative to heterotypic mating treatments if gut microbiota-induced assortative mating responds plastically or has evolved under sexual and natural selection.results and discussiongerm-free flies of both sexes were re-inoculated with either ap or lp.

future studies should address the impact of gut microbiota on the operation of sexual selection and also investigate the implications of our findings for wild populations given that the distribution and abun- dance of ap and lp in wild flies differ markedly from laboratory-adapted strains our results show the overall negative effects of ap re- inoculation on mating investment offspring production and offspring body mass of mating pairs relative to lp re- inoculation.

increased number of offspring or indirectly i.e.

increased quality of the offspring or both.

melanogaster affected aspects of reproduction and offspring body mass.

this result partly contradicts our prediction that homotypic mating confers indirect fitness advantages to the mating pair through offspring quality.

adult offspring was counted 13 days after oviposition i.e.
