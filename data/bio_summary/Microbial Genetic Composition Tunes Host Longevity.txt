Total N the number of total animals censor N the number of censored animals Lifespan extension the percentage of lifespan extension in different C. elegans mutants on each bacterial mutant compared to those on parental control bacteria p values bacterial mutant versus parental control by log rank test.See Figure S3 for effects of bacterial mutants on C. elegans feeding and defecation behaviors.involvement of low food intake in most bacteria-induced longevity effects.In addition CR can be genetically mimicked using C. elegans eat-2 mutants that have defective pharyngeal contraction during feeding .

Among the 29 lifespan-extend- ing bacterial mutants we identified 14 that significantly prolong the lifespan of the Ab transgenic strains B Table S5 and 12 of them substantially delay age-associated paralysis C. Altogether we discovered 13 bacterial mutants that protect C. elegans from lethality of both germline tumors and Ab accumulation D suggesting they may improve the overall fitness of the host.Interaction of Beneficial Microbial Factors with Host Longevity MechanismsTo gain insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of these bacterial mutants we examined whether they act through several known longevity mechanisms in the host including the insulininsulin-like growth factor IGF-1 and the target of rapamycin TOR signaling pathways as well as caloric restriction CR.

Supplementation of Dlon extracts extends the lifespan of C. elegans by 15 p  0.001 Log-rank test while extracts from the DlonDwcaD double mutant do not significantly affect C. elegans lifespan p  0.5 Log-rank test.Supplementation with other polysaccharides--hyaluronic acid HA and alginic acid AA--does not extend the lifespan of C. elegans p  0.1 Log-rank test.

Effects of Longevity-Promoting Bacterial Mutants on C. elegans Feeding and Defecation Behaviors Related to Pharyngeal pumping rates were measured in day-1-old WT worms grown on the bacterial mutants that prolong lifespan.Defecation interval length was examined in day-1-old WT worms grown on the bacterial mutants that prolong lifespan.Pharyngeal pumping rates were measured in day-1-old eat-2ad465 mutants grown on the bacterial mutants that prolong lifespan.p  0.05 compared to the control Student's t test error bars represent SEM.Figure S4.

Bacterial Mutants Attenuate Age-Related Pathologies in the HostSixteen bacterial mutants significantly increase the survival of the C. elegans glp-1ar202 mutants which exhibit early death due to age-related progression of germline tumors p  0.001 log rank test.Ectopic expression of human amyloid-b Ab in the C. elegans CL2006 transgenic strain dvIs2unc-54pAb1-42 leads to a shortened lifespan.

Moreover supplementation of two other extracellular polysaccharides hyaluronic acid and alginic acid did not extend C. elegans lifespan Figure S5C supporting the specificity of CA as a longevity-promoting polysaccharide.Next to test whether CA increases the survival of C. elegans by reducing bacterial growth or pathogenicity we monitored the growth of bacteria treated with CA.

We investigated the lifespan of the daf-16mgDf47 rsks-1ok1255 raga-1ok386 and rict-1ft7 C. elegans mutants grown on each bacterial mutant to determine whether these host factors contribute to the longevity effects of the bacterial mutants.

Although the Dlon bacterial mutant did not alter mitochon- drial DNA levels ATP production or lipid storage Figures S6A- S6C we observed that bacterial lon deficiency and CA supple- mentation significantly increase mitochondrial fragmentation in the intestine of C. elegans D. Remarkably mammalian cells treated with CA also display a more fragmented mitochon- drial network E suggesting a highly conserved function of CA in regulating mitochondrial dynamics.

The CA unit contains six monomers glucose Glc galactose Gal fucose Fuc glucuronic acid GlcA pyruvate Pyr and acetate Ac and is polymerized by WcaD in the periplasm.Inhibition of CA polymerization by the bacterial DwcaD deletion fully suppresses the lifespan extension of C. elegans induced by the Dlon bacterial mutant p  0.05 DwcaDDlon versus DwcaD log rank test.Gel permeation chromatography analysis determines the molecular weight of purified CA as 3.4 kDa.

In a model or- ganism C. elegans we systematically identified bacterial genes whose deletion leads to lifespan extension and revealed the po- tential of a dozen of these bacterial mutants in attenuating lethality due to age-associated progression of germline tumor and accumulation of pathological Ab.
