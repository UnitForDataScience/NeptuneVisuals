We used 10 mgL of recombinant-ORAIP to induce apoptosis in cultured cardiac myocytes in the previous study  in which more than 70 cardiac myocytes underwent apoptosis in 72 h. This seemed to be an adequate concentration to analyze the apoptosis induction in vitro.

ORAIP will be a biomarker and a critical therapeutic target for cardiac injury and progression of DM itself.Keywords apoptosis cardiac myocytes diabetes mellitus DM high glucose oxidative stress oxidative stress-responsive apoptosis inducing protein ORAIP pancreatic b-cellsIntroductionCardiovascular injury involved in DM is known to be mainly due to coronary artery disease with myocardial ischemiareperfusion as well as direct metabolic cardiac myocyte injury by hyperglycemia.

In this study to investigate the mechanism of cell injury of cardiac myocytes and pancreatic b-cells involved in diabetes mellitus DM we analyzed plasma ORAIP levels in DM model rats and the role of ORAIP in high glucose-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in vitro.

This indicates that high glucose-induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes was mostly mediated by ORAIP secreted by cardiac myocytes in an autocrine fashion.

High glucose significantly induced the expression of ORAIP in cardiac myocytes resulting in massive apoptosis in cardiac myocytes in an autocrine fashion in vitro.

A red line indicates the regression line.High Glucose Induces Expression of ORAIP in Cultured Cardiac MyocytesNext to investigate the direct effect of hyperglycemia on cardiac myocytes especially the expression of ORAIP in cardiac myocytes we examined whether high glucose induces the expression of ORAIP in cardiac myocytes in vitro.

Next to investigate whether elevated plasma levels of ORAIP induces apoptosis of pancreatic b-cells we analyzed apoptosis induction of MIN6 cells by recombinant-ORAIP in vitro.

High glucose induced massive apoptosis in cardiac myocytes 66.2 - 2.2 which was 78 suppressed by neutralizing anti-ORAIP mAb in vitro.

The apoptosis of cardiac myocytes induced by hypoxiareoxygenation was suppressed by anti-eIF5A neutralizing mAbs in vitro.

We confirmed that ORAIP is specifically secreted in response to the oxidative stresses including ischemiareperfusion hypoxiareoxygenation ultraviolet-irradiation ionizing radiation coldwarm-stress heat shock and blood acidification  then acts as a pro-apoptotic ligand to induce apoptosis in target cells such as cardiac myocytes.
