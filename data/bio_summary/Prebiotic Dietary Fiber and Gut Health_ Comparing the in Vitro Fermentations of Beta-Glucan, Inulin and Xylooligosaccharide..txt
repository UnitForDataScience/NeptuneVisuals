Table S1 Gas and SCFA Production Comparing Fermentation Differences of Five Prebiotic Dietary Fibers at 12 h and 24 h Post-Exposure to Fecal Microbiota from Three Individual Donors in an In Vitro Fermentation System Figure S1 Identified phyla from three fecal donors microbiota at 0 12 and 24 h of fermentation for five prebiotic dietary fibers analyzed based on percent of sequence reads Figure S2 Identified abundant families for three fecal donors at 0 12 and 24 h of fermentation for five prebiotic dietary fibers analyzed based on percent of sequence reads Figure S3 Identified abundant genera for three fecal donors at 0 12 and 24 h of fermentation for five prebiotic dietary fibers analyzed based on percent of sequence reads Figure S4 Six metrics of analysis for alpha-diversity among samples at 0 12 and 24 h of analysis grouped by donor for all five prebiotic dietary fibers analyzed Figure S5 Six metrics of analysis for alpha-diversity among samples at 0 12 and 24 h of analysis grouped by treatment for all three fecal donors Figure S6 Bray-Curtis b-diversity principal component analysis of technical replicates among each treatment group between microbiota analysis of three fecal donors Figure S7 Bray-Curtis b-diversity principal component analysis among microbiota of three fecal donors at 0 12 and 24 h of analysis Figure S8 Variations in abundant phyla among three donors analyzed Figure S9 Variations in treatment groups and pooled donors analyzed.Acknowledgments This study was funded by DSM.

Both Unifrac and Bray-Curtis b-diversity metrics measuring pairwise dissimilarity between samples showed similarity among technical replicates of treatment groups for each donor Figure S6 as well as for all treatment groups for each respective donor Figure S7.After 24 h of fermentation the Oatwell samples significantly decreased the population of SMB53 0 h9.11 OTUs 24 h2.11 OTUs p  0.008 Lachnospira and Faecalibacterium 0 h26.56 OTUs 24 h4.44 OTUs p  0.008 and 0 h 136.44 OTUs 24 h66 OTUs p  0.022 respectively Table .

Oatwell's effect was similar to those of the pure beta-glucan samples both samples promoted the highest mean propionate production at 24 h. XOS resulted in a significant increase in the genus Bifidobacterium after 24 h of fermentation 0 h0.67 OTUs operational taxonomic unit 24 h5.22 OTUs p  0.038.

Total gas production comparing fermentation differences among five prebiotic dietary fibers for three individuals at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to fecal microbiota in an in vitro fermentation system.

Acetate production at 12 h and 24 h of fermentation for five prebiotic dietary fibers displayed as umolmL of fermentation inoculum.

Propionate production at 12 h and 24 h of fermentation for five prebiotic dietary fibers displayed as umolmL of fermentation inoculum.

Butyrate production at 12 h and 24 h of fermentation for five prebiotic dietary fibers displayed as umolmL of fermentation inoculum.

In vitro fermentation models allow for quantitative analysis of specific materials and are semi-representative models of colonic fermentation .

Columns with different letters are significantly different from one another lowercase 12 h uppercase 24 h. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD p  0.05.Propionate production at 12 h of fermentation was highest for the OatWell samples 4.76 umolmL and was significantly greater than the WholeFiber p  0.029 XOS p  0.005 and inulin samples p  0.004 and similar to the beta-glucan samples Figure .

At 24 h of fermentation the Oatwell samples had the highest mean production 5.05 umolmL which was significantly greater than the XOS samples 2.58 umolmL p  0.021 and similar to WholeFiber inulin and beta-glucan samples.Figure 3.
