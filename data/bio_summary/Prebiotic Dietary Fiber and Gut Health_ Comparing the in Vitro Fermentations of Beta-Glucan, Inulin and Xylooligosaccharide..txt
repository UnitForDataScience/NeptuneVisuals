at 24 h the oatwell samples had the lowest gas production 46.2 ml and were similar to the pure beta-glucan samples 63.7 ml p  0.498. the 24 h xos samples 74.0 ml were also similar to the beta-glucan samples p  0.926. however the 24 h wholefiber 109.6 ml and pure inulin 107.1 ml samples produced significantly more gas than xos beta-glucan and oatwell samples p  0.01. individual variation in gas production can be seen in table s1.figure 1. total gas production comparing fermentation differences among five prebiotic dietary fibers for three individuals at 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to fecal microbiota in an in vitro fermentation system.
