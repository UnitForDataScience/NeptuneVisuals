The target Chlamydia spe- cies of this study is C. pecorum however C. pneumoniae has previously been identified in koalasand C. psittaci is endemic to birds of the study region.

The categorisation of C. pecorum infection status was based on qPCR testing and C. pecorum detection in the microbiota analysis.

It is unknown how common CLOs are what diversity exists and if they contribute to chlamydial disease.Due to the unique nature of C. pecorum's koala host there is little available information on the site-specific host response to and interaction with C. pecorum infection.

It was found that when the animal was infected with C. pecorum at the ocular site the dominant OTU observed was C. pecorum with a minimal number of non-chlamydial OTUs detected resulting in their removal from the analysis.

This provides an indication that the urogenital microbiota influences the C. pecorum infection potential rather than C. pecorum influencing the microbiota.Canonical Correspondence Analysis of urogenital microbiotas.

These variations interestingly co-correlated with disease status with low C. pecorum detection being correlated with reproductive disease RD and negative C. pecorum infection status with no associated disease NAD.

To avoid biasing during subsequent statistical analysis C. pecorum OTUs were removed from the OTU table and C. pecorum microbiota counts were used in assessing infection status Table .

The ability to study C. pecorum infections was limited by the infective agents dominating detection over non-C. pecorum reads.

UGT samples from high C. pecorum-infected animals had lower microbiota diversity and richness compared to those samples from animals with low level infection or negative for C. pecorum Fig.

This raises several questions Is the infective capability of C. pecorum influenced by the microbiota Is there a life stage when animals are more susceptible to infection due to their microbiota It was noted during analysis in both diversity and the range of OTU abundance that a Chlamydia-negative microbiota could have similar com- position and structure to those in high C. pecorum-infected animals.
