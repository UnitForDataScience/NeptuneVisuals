However to date no specific microbiome fingerprint for obesity has been identified 23.The clear effects of CAF on different components of MetS and the role of gut microbiota in obesity and its derived pathologies prompted us to hypothesize that CAF can alter the gut microbiome of healthy rats and that these changes may be associated with some physiological alterations related to MetS caused by this specific diet.

Therefore the associations found between microbiota and tissues such as adipose liver ormuscle might reflect the cross talk between microbiota and the host metabolism mediated by different metabolites and hormones.Among the different plasma components analyzed both glycerol and leptin clearly showed the highest number of associations with cecum bacteria mainly Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria.

Also hepatic lipid accretion was associated with changes in microbiota highlighting the relevance of gut microbiota homeostasis in the adipose-liver axis.Conclusions Overall our results suggest that CAF feeding has a profound impact on the gut microbiome and in turn that these changes may be associated with important features of MetS.IntroductionThe incidence of metabolic syndrome MetS is growing among developed and developing societies due to the increasing prevalence of obesity among all population groups 12.

A PLS-based methodology was used to reveal associations between gut microbiota characterized by 16S rDNA gene sequencing and biochemical nutritional and physiological parameters.Results CAF feeding resulted in obesity dyslipidemia insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.

Our objective was to assess the effects of CAF on gut microbiota and their associations with different components of MetS in Wistar rats.Methods Animals were fed a standard diet or CAF for 12 weeks.

Codes for bacteria are described in table 2.Associations between physiological parameters and metagenome in rats fed STD and CAFSelection of associations with R2 over 0.7 revealed that together with Firmicutes only two more phyla presented negative associations while the rest were positively associated with white adipose tissues and negatively associated with muscle weight.

Thus both glucose and insulin showed positive associations with different phyla while glycerol was negatively associated with Firmicutes and mostly positively 4 out of 5 associated with Bacteroidetes.

Together with the IWAT the muscle was the most associated tissue with 18 associations supplementary figure 2 and figure 2.Concerning the plasma parameters those showing associations with phyla with a R2 over 0.7 were glucose 3 associations insulin 4 triglycerides 7 NEFA 7 and adiponectin 1.
