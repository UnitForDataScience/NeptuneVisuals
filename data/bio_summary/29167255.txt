PROKARYOTESComplete Genome Sequences of Two Plant-Associated Pseudomonas putida Isolates with Increased Heavy-Metal Tolerancea Barbara Caniaab Urska Zadela Anne Scholera Graz.yna A. Plazab Michael SchloteraResearch Unit for Comparative Microbiome Analysis Department of Environmental Sciences Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen Neuherberg Germanya Department of Environmental Microbiology Institute for Ecology of Industrial Areas Katowice PolandbABSTRACT We report here the complete genome sequences of two Pseudomonas putida isolates recovered from surface-sterilized roots of Sida hermaphrodita.

P. putida is also often found to be associated with plants and can actively enhance their growth and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stressors   notably elevated heavy-metalconcentrations in soil .Pseudomonas putida strains namely E41 and E46 were isolated from surface- sterilized roots of Sida hermaphrodita grown on the Institute for Ecology of Industrial Areas' experimental field in Bytom Upper Silesia Poland 50deg2043.0N 18deg5719.6E.

Furthermore the strains showed typical plant growth-promoting properties such as the production of indole acetic acid cellulolytic enzymes and siderophores.he Pseudomonas putida complex is a broad group of Gammaproteobacteria including mostly isolates from environmental samples  and comprising sev- eral genomic species .

P. putida isolates are characterized by a versatile metabolism allowing them to survive in a variety of different ecological settings.
