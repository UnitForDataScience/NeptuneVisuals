Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effect of cluster independent of alpha diversity or alpha diversity independent of cluster by including either cluster membership or alpha diversity metrics as a covariate in the reciprocal analyses.

FPD SI OS and CH1 were all significantly different between clusters with C1 showing the greatest alpha diversity and C2 showing the least .Sensitivity AnalysesWe conducted analyses to determine if cluster membership or alpha diversity had the larger impact on outcomes by including either cluster or individual alpha diversity metrics as a covari- ate.

Subsequently the diversity of species within each individual alpha diversity increases rapidly as facultative aerobic Enterobacteriaceae give way to strict anaerobes which are then displaced by a mixture of Clostridiales .

We also predicted that lower alpha diversity indicating a less mature microbiome would be correlated with lower cognitive performance given reports that low alpha diversity in infancy precede negative health outcomes including type 1 diabetes and asthma .

Using these methods we obtained measures of intracranial volume total gray matter total white matter total cerebrospinal fluid lateral ventricle volume and 90-region gray matter volumes at 1 year of age for 46 subjects and at 2 years of age for 27 subjects.Association of Cognitive and Brain Outcomes With Cluster Membership and Alpha DiversityLinear mixed effect models were used to test for effects of cluster membership and alpha diversity on cognitive perfor- mance and brain volumes as well as cluster membership on alpha diversity.

Alpha diversity measures accounted for 5 to 23 of the variance in Mullen scores.Alpha Diversity Associated With Regional Gray Matter Volumes at 2 Years of AgeSecondary analyses testing the association of alpha diversity metrics with brain volumes at 1 and 2 years of age revealed three regions of significance at age 2 covariates older siblings paternal ethnicity and total intracranial volume.

Similarly no significant associations of alpha diversity metrics with 1-year brain volumes were observed after FDR correction.Alpha Diversity Differs Between ClustersFinally we tested whether measures of alpha diversity differed between clusters.

This was somewhat surprising because high alpha diversity in infancy indicates a more mature adult- like community and low alpha diversity in infancy is associated with negative health outcomes including type 1 diabetes and asthma .

However the notion that alpha diversity is always positive has been challenged recently because high alpha diversity has been found in adult subjects with major depressive disorder and autism spectrum disorder .

In addition higher alpha diversity was associated with lower scores on the overall composite score visual reception scale and expressive language scale at 2 years of age.
