However Weimer concluded that ruminal microbiota have a high redundan- cy and resilience that limit the effects of dietary and manage- ment changes on the function and composition of these microbiota.In agreement with many previous studies    the switch to the high-grain diet during the SARA challenge and the resulting changes in the conditions and substrate availabil- ities in the rumen reduced the richness and diversity of the microbiota in the rumen fluid and caused the bacterial com- munities in the rumen fluid of the control and SARA cows to cluster separately.

This study was conducted using high-throughput MiSeq Illumina sequencing to determine the changes in the microbiota in the rumen fluid and feces resulting from a 7-day grain-based SARA challenge on the composition of microbiota in the rumen and feces and to test if these changes in the feces can be used for the diag- nosis of SARA.Materials and MethodsAnimals Feeding and Experimental DesignThe design of this study was described earlier by Danscher et al.

Briefly rumen fluid was collected from the ventral sac of the rumen and strained through four layers of sterile cheesecloth.

Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla in the rumen fluid and feces and combined they represented 76.9 and 94.4 of the bacterial community in the rumen fluid and the feces re- spectively.

The SARA challenge increased the relative abun- dance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the rumen fluid whereas it decreased that of Cyanobacteria and Table 1 Summary statistics of sequences in the rumen fluid of dairy cows under the control and SARA treatments at days 7 and 10 of experimental periods.

described that the SARA induction in- creased the duration of the rumen pH below pH 5.6 from 11 to 295 minday and reduced the average rumen pH and average feces pH from 6.31 to 6.06 and from 6.48 to 6.09 respectively.

The SARA induction also reduced the acetate to propionate ratio in the rumen fluid from 3.23 to 2.52 which is further evidence of the change in the conditions in the rumen and common when the cows are switched from a high-forage to a high-grain diet .

Hence the changes of these compounds in the rumen digesta may be associated with and signs of chang- es on the composition of rumen microbiota.

observed that SARA reduced the bacte- rial density in the rumen solids but not in the rumen fluid and feces.
