The following MeSH terms and key words were used to search for relevant literature probiotic prebiotic synbiotic postoperative complications surgical site infection SSI wound infection abdominal abscess peritonitis urinary tract infection UTI pneumonia sepsis length of hospital stay length of antibiotic administration mortality surgical operation surgery abdom- inal surgery transplantation colorectal surgery colectomy small bowel surgery hepatectomy biliary surgery and pancreas surgery.STUDY DEFINITION AND OUTCOMESInterventions of StudyProbiotic prebiotic and synbiotic therapies were commit- ted interventions of this study.

The 5 most common surgical proce- dures were abdominal surgery colorectal surgery liver trans- plantation hepatectomy and pancreatectomy Table 1 and Supplementary Appendix 2.S156  CID 201764 Suppl 2  Kasatpibal et alPrimary Outcome SSIWe found that synbiotic therapy was the best choice in reduc- ing SSI in adult surgical patients.

There was no evidence of loop inconsistency or global inconsistency in all networks except length of antibiotics therapy Supplementary Appendix 7.Publication BiasWe did not find publication bias for the network of primary and secondary outcomes Supplementary Appendix 12 eFigures 12.1-12.9.DISCUSSIONThis systematic review and NMA found that synbiotic therapy was the best regimen in reducing SSI pneumonia sepsis hospi- tal stay and antibiotic use in adult surgical patients as compared to probiotics and prebiotics alone.

In addi- tion a previous study documented that the use of probiotics without antibiotic prophylaxis increased risk of postoperative septic complications including SSI 15.Unlike a previous RCT 34 our study findings suggest that synbiotics have superior effectiveness to prevent SSI than additional preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and MBP 34.

The findings revealed that synbiotic therapy was the highest ranked in terms of reducing SSI among patients with gastrointestinal disorders and those who did not have a cancer diagnosis.

We also found that preoperative plus postoperative synbiotic therapy was the best regimen in reducing SSI in adult surgical patients com- pared to other interventions such as probiotics prebiotics MBP enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition and normal diet.

Lastly because most studies came from Asia and European countries the results may have limited generalizability to other populations.In conclusion this systematic review and network meta-anal- ysis found the synbiotic therapy ranked first over probiotics prebiotics antibiotic normal diet enteral nutrition oral neo- mycin plus bowel preparation bowel preparation parenteral nutrition synbiotics plus oral neomycin plus bowel prepa- ration and placebo to reduce SSI.

This study is the first system- atic review to our knowledge using NMA to examine the effec- tiveness and to determine the best choice of probiotic prebiotic and synbiotic regimen in reducing SSI and other POCs in adult surgical patients.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN criteria 26 were used for diagnosing SSI including superficial incisional deep incisional or organspace SSI.

We found that synbiotic therapy was the best regimen in reducing surgical site infection SSI RR  0.28 95 CI 0.12-0.64 in adult surgical patients.
