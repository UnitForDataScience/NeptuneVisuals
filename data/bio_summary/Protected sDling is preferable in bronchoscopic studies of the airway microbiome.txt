thus unprotected sampling of the airway microbiome might convey an image of a microbiome that is more similar to the oral microbiome than it would have been with protected sampling.oral washsmall volume lavage lul protected bal fraction 1 rml protected bal fraction 2 rml protected brush rll protected brush lulfigure 3 principal coordinates analyses on unweighted unifrac distance matrix comparing sampling methods in the microcopd to oral wash samples.

added to this is the conundrum caused by the constant influx of microbiota by microaspiration and inhalation that probably is responsible for maintenance and creation of a large fraction of the lung microbiome in 25 studies of the human lung microbiome sampling the airway microbiome by bronchoscopy of healthy subjects - - and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd - asthma interstitial lung disease cystic fibrosis cf hiv - and lung-transplanted subjects -only five used protected sterile brushes psb to avoid contamination from the working channel  some authors reported that suction was not used prior to entering the trachea --and three studies used separate bronchoscopes for anaesthesia and sampling of some or all participants  no study performed bronchoalveolar lavage bal through a protected catheter  protected bal and no study with more than 20 sampled subjects has compared protected with unprotected sampling methods.in preparation for the analyses of a large ongoing copd microbiome study we sought to reduce contamination as well as assess the performance of different sampling techniques.

as can be seen most respiratory tract samples clustered differently from the ow samples but the visual impression is that the differences in diversity were smaller between ow and svl and ow and pbal samples than for ow and the psb samples.

participants were monitored according to current guidelines and were observed for at least 2 h after the procedure  six procedural samples of which five were obtained during bronchoscopy were analysed for each participant oral wash ow three protected specimen brushes psbs from the right lower lobe right psb and three from the left upper lobe left psb two 50-ml fractions of protected bronchoalveolar lavage of the right middle lobe pbal1 and pbal2 and small-volume lavage svl in the left upper lobe.

compared psb and svl samples of nine cf patients for eight cf patients who had psb and svl taken from the same lobe diversity was consistently higher in the psb samples the opposite of our findings.

e-mail abstract the aim was to evaluate susceptibility of oropharyngeal contamination with various bronchoscopic sampling techniques.67 patients with obstructive lung disease and 58 control subjects underwent bronchoscopy with small- volume lavage svl through the working channel protected bronchoalveolar lavage pbal and bilateral protected specimen brush psb sampling.

also beta-diversity varied by sampling method  p0.01 and visualisation of principal coordinates analyses indicated that differences in diversity were smaller between ow and svl and ow and pbal samples than for ow and the psb samples.
