When the distance matrix was split according to the comparisons in  all were significant  p0.01 permanova corrected for multiple comparison with the permanova pseudo F-statistic gradually increasing for the comparison of OW with SVL PBAL1 PBAL2 right PSB and left PSB respectively again indicating that PSB samples were more clearly separated from OW samples than SVL and PBAL.Finally we investigated whether the order of sampling left versus right lung first influenced alpha- and beta-diversity in PSB samples.

As can be seen most respiratory tract samples clustered differently from the OW samples but the visual impression is that the differences in diversity were smaller between OW and SVL and OW and PBAL samples than for OW and the PSB samples.

compared PSB and SVL samples of nine CF patients For eight CF patients who had PSB and SVL taken from the same lobe diversity was consistently higher in the PSB samples the opposite of our findings.

Participants were monitored according to current guidelines and were observed for at least 2 h after the procedure  Six procedural samples of which five were obtained during bronchoscopy were analysed for each participant oral wash OW three protected specimen brushes PSBs from the right lower lobe right PSB and three from the left upper lobe left PSB two 50-mL fractions of protected bronchoalveolar lavage of the right middle lobe PBAL1 and PBAL2 and small-volume lavage SVL in the left upper lobe.

Added to this is the conundrum caused by the constant influx of microbiota by microaspiration and inhalation that probably is responsible for maintenance and creation of a large fraction of the lung microbiome In 25 studies of the human lung microbiome sampling the airway microbiome by bronchoscopy of healthy subjects - - and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD - asthma interstitial lung disease cystic fibrosis CF HIV - and lung-transplanted subjects -only five used protected sterile brushes PSB to avoid contamination from the working channel  Some authors reported that suction was not used prior to entering the trachea --and three studies used separate bronchoscopes for anaesthesia and sampling of some or all participants  No study performed bronchoalveolar lavage BAL through a protected catheter  protected BAL and no study with more than 20 sampled subjects has compared protected with unprotected sampling methods.In preparation for the analyses of a large ongoing COPD microbiome study we sought to reduce contamination as well as assess the performance of different sampling techniques.

We found no significant difference in alpha- or beta-diversity for the right or the left PSBs as judged by phylogenetic diversity and unweighted UniFrac supplementary figures S3 and S4.DiscussionWe have shown that protected BAL and protected brush samples differed more from oral wash samples than unprotected lavage through the bronchoscope working channel.

Also beta-diversity varied by sampling method  p0.01 and visualisation of principal coordinates analyses indicated that differences in diversity were smaller between OW and SVL and OW and PBAL samples than for OW and the PSB samples.

The 64 COPD subjects were slightly older included more men and had a larger tobacco-smoking burden than the 58 control subjects 1.For each of the 125 participants seven samples were sequenced negative control sample OW right PSB PBAL1 PBAL2 left PSB SVL.
