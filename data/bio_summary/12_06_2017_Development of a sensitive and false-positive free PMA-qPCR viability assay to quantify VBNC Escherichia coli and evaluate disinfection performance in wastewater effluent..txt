stock solutions of the sketa dna were prepared by diluting the frozen 20 mgml 1 in 10 150 ml into 1350 ml in molecular grade water sigma as described by .dna extractiongenomic dna was isolated from the wwtp samples and the con- trol strain of e. coli k12 atcc 19853 using the powersoilr dna iso- lation kit mo bio laboratories inc.. the quantity of genomic dna from the control strain was determined using the qubitr 3.0 fluo- rometer and the quality determined by analyzing the 260280 nm ratio using the varian cary-100 bio uv-vis spectrophotometer all samples had ratios n 1.8. isolated dna samples were stored at- 20 degc prior to analysis.qpcr protocol optimization and analysisthe uida gene target qpcr protocol was generated using the bio-rad cfx96 software and all but one parameter was altered.

the 25 and 50 mm treatments showed less of an effect results are shown in b. the third method the e. coli spiked ww pbs-washed samples showed an increase in cq for the 1 ml ww concentrate sample of 0.93 and a de- crease of 0.15 and 0.08 for the 10 and 100 ml ww concentrate samples compared to the spiked pbs samples  resulting in a decreased de- tection of the log10 genomic units of 0.28 for the 1 ml concentrate and an increased detection of the log10 genomic units of the 10 and 100 ml concentrates of 0.05 and 0.03 respectively.

for each procedure 1 ml of a 20 h culture of e. coli was washed in pbs then spiked into 400 ml fresh ww and mixed by inversion for 30 s.procedure 1 three replicates of 1 10 and 100 ml ww samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 5 min samples represent 1x 10x and 100x concentrates su- pernatant discarded and pellets resuspended in 450 ml of phosphate buffer ph 6.6 and to this 50 ml of 100 mm aluminum sulfate al2so4 solution was added to give a final concentration of 10 mm.

in order to eliminate the false positives in the qpcr assay for the detection of the uida gene in e. coli used native taq due to the presence of con- taminant e. coli dna in recombinant taq polymerase reagents and were able to detect as low as 5 copies of the uida gene compared with 10- 10000 gene copy numbers reported in the literature.application of pma-qpcr for detection of e. coli in secondary wastewater effluent requires the effluent first to be concentrated.

200 ml of each were added separately to three replicate sets of 1x 10x and 100x concentrated ww sample pellets in their respective dna extraction kit lysis tubes samples were briefly vortexed to incorporate the chemistry and dna extractions carried out.procedure 3 three replicate sets of 1 10 and 100 ml ww samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 5 min 1x 10x and 100x concentrates the sample su- pernatants removed and the pellet resuspended in pbs for a single wash. the wash consisted of a 15 s vortex in pbs followed by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 5 min to obtain a pellet ready for dna extraction.for the three procedures 1 ml dna templates were assessed by qpcr using the uida gene qpcr protocol as described herein to determine inhibition by comparing the cq values of the treated and untreated concentrates.

genomic copies of these targets were much lower than expected with  2-3log10 genomic copies for the influent and sludge samples and no detection from secondary effluent samples.

6. the sketa dna amplification reduction after 200 mm pma treatment showed a 9.53 dcq 3.13 from 4.73 log10 genomic units for the wwd samples and a 13.53 d cq 4.41 from 6.97 log10 genomic units for the high titer control sample ntc samples showed primer dimers at a cq of 31.08 setting the detection limit to 1.48 log10 genomic units.experiments.

the method was used to determine the number of viable and vbnc e. coli cells that survive chlorine disinfection in wastewater and to evaluate the true disinfection performance.material and methodsa flow-chart that illustrates the experimental steps and protocols are illustrated in .wastewater samplessecondary effluent wastewater samples prior to disinfection ww and after chlorine disinfection wwd were collected from a conven- tional activated sludge treatment plant in ontario canada.
