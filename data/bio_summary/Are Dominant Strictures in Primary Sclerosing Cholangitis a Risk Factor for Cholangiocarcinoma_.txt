overall the cancer risk in their cohort appeared to be more dependant on thepresence of a ds rather than the combination of concurrent ibd and a dominant biliary stricture.taken together the limited data suggest that the presence of a ds regardless of whether it occurs at the diagnosis of psc or develops during the course of follow-up represents an in- creased risk of both cholangiocarcinoma and reduced surviv- al.

it has recently been demonstrated that patients with serial biliary polysomy have high risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma although patients with reversion of polysomy greater than 50 of the psc pa- tients studied have a decreased risk .per-oral video cholangioscopy has been studied as a mode of potentially increasing the sensitivity of diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of ds in psc.

doi 10.1007s11901-017-0341-2are dominant strictures in primary sclerosing cholangitis a risk factor for cholangiocarcinomaroger w chapman123  kate d. williamson12published online 27 april 2017 the authors 2017. this article is an open access publicationabstractpurpose of review cholangiocarcinoma is a devastating un- predictable complication of large duct primary sclerosing cholangitis psc which occurs in 5-15 of patients.

thus there is clearly an unmet need to identify subgroups of psc patients at particular high risk of developing cholangio- carcinoma where heightened surveillance may be helpful inidentifying cholangiocarcinoma at an early treatable stage.dominant strictures in pscpatients with large duct psc may develop progressive jaundice worsening of their liver biochemistry or symptoms of cholangitis prompting investigation for a dominant stricture ds.

ds should be treated endoscopically in the setting of symptoms and there is limited evidence tosuggest this may impact protectively on progression to cholangiocarcinoma.summary it is established that the presence of symptomatic ds occurring in the larger bile ducts in psc can be the first presentation of cholangiocarcinoma.

current evidence is conflicting as to whether temporary stenting after balloon dilatation offers any extra benefit and a randomised multicentre european trial is in progress to address this issue .antibiotics such as quinolones should be administered in the setting of acute cholangitis related to a ds and prophylactic antibiotics such as low-dose ciprofloxacin are sometimes re- quired in the clinical setting of recurrent cholangitis.

half of the patients with cholangiocarcinoma presented within 4 months of the diagnosis of psc emphasising the importance of thor- ough evaluation of new ds.these findings have been confirmed from a german study namely that the presence of ds in psc is associated with a worse prognosis and an increased risk of carcinomas both in the bile duct and colon .

the aim of this review is to discuss whether dominant strictures ds occurring in the larger bile ducts in psc are a risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma.recent findings the development of ds is related to specific genetic polymorphisms affecting the innate immune system and the microbiome.

survival difference was related to a 26 risk of cholangiocarcinoma which developed only in those with ds.

the variant cd14-260ct polymorphism was associated with the development of ds and an increased risk of cholangitis.

presence of this genotype in psc has been strongly associated with episodes of cholangitis fungobilia and the incidence of dominant stenosis .the effect of dominant stricture on prognosis and the risk of cholangiocarcinomathe presence of a ds has been associated with a worsened long-term prognosis.

a summary of these studies pertaining to the risk of ds leading to cholangiocarcinoma is presented in table .dilatation of dominant strictures and possible reduction of cancer riskif symptomatic dominant strictures should be dilated with endoscopic balloon dilatation via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp and may often require multiple dilatations over time.

chromosomal polysomydetected by fish has been shown to identify patients with early cholangiocarcinoma or those patients with a high risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.

annual cholangioscopy with biliary biop- sies analogous to yearly colonoscopy for the early detec- tion of colonic carcinoma in psc is being studied pro- spectively in high-risk psc patients with extrahepatic dis- ease particularly those patients with ds.conclusionthere is an unmet need to identify subgroups of psc patients at particular high risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma where heightened surveillance may be helpful in identifying cholangiocarcinoma at an early treatable stage.
