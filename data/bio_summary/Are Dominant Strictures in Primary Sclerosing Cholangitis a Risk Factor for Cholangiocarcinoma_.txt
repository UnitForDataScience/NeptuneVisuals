Current evidence is conflicting as to whether temporary stenting after balloon dilatation offers any extra benefit and a randomised multicentre European trial is in progress to address this issue .Antibiotics such as quinolones should be administered in the setting of acute cholangitis related to a DS and prophylactic antibiotics such as low-dose ciprofloxacin are sometimes re- quired in the clinical setting of recurrent cholangitis.

The aim of this review is to discuss whether dominant strictures DS occurring in the larger bile ducts in PSC are a risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma.Recent Findings The development of DS is related to specific genetic polymorphisms affecting the innate immune system and the microbiome.

In a recent study the mean survival of PSC patients with DS was much worse 13.7 years than for those without a DS 23 years.

DS should be treated endoscopically in the setting of symptoms and there is limited evidence tosuggest this may impact protectively on progression to cholangiocarcinoma.Summary It is established that the presence of symptomatic DS occurring in the larger bile ducts in PSC can be the first presentation of cholangiocarcinoma.

In this selected population the mean survival of those with DS was much worse 13.7 years than for thosewithout a DS 23 years.

In the DS group bacteria in the bile had no effect on survival whereas Candida in the bile was associated with reduced survival.The findings relating to the effect of IBD on the natural history of DS were not confirmed in a cohort of 241 Dutch PSC patients followed for a mean of 6 years .

Overall the cancer risk in their cohort appeared to be more dependant on thepresence of a DS rather than the combination of concurrent IBD and a dominant biliary stricture.Taken together the limited data suggest that the presence of a DS regardless of whether it occurs at the diagnosis of PSC or develops during the course of follow-up represents an in- creased risk of both cholangiocarcinoma and reduced surviv- al.

Thus there is clearly an unmet need to identify subgroups of PSC patients at particular high risk of developing cholangio- carcinoma where heightened surveillance may be helpful inidentifying cholangiocarcinoma at an early treatable stage.Dominant Strictures in PSCPatients with large duct PSC may develop progressive jaundice worsening of their liver biochemistry or symptoms of cholangitis prompting investigation for a dominant stricture DS.

The variant CD14-260CT polymorphism was associated with the development of DS and an increased risk of cholangitis.
