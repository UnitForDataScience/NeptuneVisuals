thus changes in glucidic composition of the intestinal mucous maria gabriella gabrielli1 school of biosciences and veterinary medicine university of camerino via gentile iii da varano i camerino 62032 macerata italylayer may alter the composition and the equilibrium of the intestinal microbiota which in turn can affect the nature and production rates of the colonic mucus   resulting inreduced viability of the defensive barrier and susceptibility to gastrointestinal diseases  .

in addition chemical and enzy- matic pretreatments combined with appropriate lectins have been addressed to both localize sialylated glycan sequences and clarify the degree and position of acetylated substituents in sialic acid residues .the finding of distinct modifications in the intestinal gly- coconjugates in response to a particular dietary pattern such as starch might provide new insights into the suggested rela- tion between diet intestinal microenvironment and colonic dysfunction.materials and methodsanimalseleven-twelve-week-old female sprague-dawley rats morini reggio emilia italy were kept in the univer- sity's animal care facility they were housed in plas- tic cages with wire tops and bottoms and maintained at constant environmental temperature 20-22 degc on a 12 h light-dark cycle according to internationally accepted guidelines.

altered glycosylation pat- terns of the intestinal mucosa in particular the expression of certain sialylated sugar chains as well as changes of sialic acid o-acetylation have been associated with inflammatory intestinal disorders and colorectal adenomas and carcinomas -.

other glycosylation changes tend not to correlate so well with glycosyltransferase activity and could be a consequence of bacterial metabolism or a result of the ongoing inflammatory response.even the contribution of dietary factors to this critical intestinal environment still requires to be fully clarified also to identify appropriate modifications of the diet that may protect the intestinal mucosa from various diseases.

in sev- eral species experimental data pointed out the potential of dietary factors in affecting morphological features and crypt- villus architecture of the large intestinal epithelium cell pro- liferation and the thickness and chemical characteristics of the intestinal mucus layer -.

the question arises from the knowledge that dietary factors by providing substrates for the intestinal microbiota influence the intestinal microenvironment and the functional effi- ciency of the mucosal barrier  .

doi 10.1007s00394-017-1393-3starch-enriched diet modulates the glucidic profile in the rat colonic mucosamaria gabriella gabrielli1  daniele tomassoni1received 1 august 2016  accepted 2 february 2017  published online 9 april 2017c springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2017abstractpurpose the protective function of the intestinal mucosa largely depends on carbohydrate moieties that as a part of glycoproteins and glycolipids form the epithelial glycoca- lyx or are secreted as mucins.

to provide additional data on the effects of starch on the intestinal micro- environment we aimed here to verify whether a long-term feeding on a high starch diet can affect the glucidic profile of the colonic mucosa of rats.

since the classic histological stud- ies on germ-free animals the intestinal bacteria have been recognized to play an essential role in driving the matura- tion of the colonic mucosa and normal mucus production  .

we found that a starch-enriched diet modulates the glucidic profile and the structural features of glycoconju- gates in the colonic epithelium goblet cells and crypts.in both the experimental groups a regional distribu-tion of acidic glycoconjugates distinct as sialomucins and sulfomucins was evidenced within the colonic mucosashowing an increasing gradient of sulfomucins from proxi- mal to distal colon.

modifications of their expres- sion can be induced by an altered intestinal microenviron- ment and have been associated with inflammatory disorders and colorectal cancer.

growing research interest is focused on studying the multiple exogenous and endogenous factors that modulate the critical equilibrium of these different compo- nents as well as their effects on the intestinal mucosa and its secretory products.

in addition previous investigations on germ free and conventional rats fed different diets have proven that dietary factors and microbial flora interact in modifying the glucidic composition of intestinal mucins  .

based on these data our finding that glcnac occurrence increases in the goblet cells in response to the starch-enriched diet as indicated by the wga reactivity pattern may account for an enhanced production of highly sulfated mucins.also the widely modified expression of fucosylated and sialylated sequences that we found in the rat colon might be related to a possible alteration of the intestinal microbiota induced by the starch rich diet as previously reported .
