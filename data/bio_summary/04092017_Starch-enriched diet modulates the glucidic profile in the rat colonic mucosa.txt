Thus changes in glucidic composition of the intestinal mucous Maria Gabriella Gabrielli1 School of Biosciences and Veterinary Medicine University of Camerino Via Gentile III da Varano I Camerino 62032 Macerata Italylayer may alter the composition and the equilibrium of the intestinal microbiota which in turn can affect the nature and production rates of the colonic mucus   resulting inreduced viability of the defensive barrier and susceptibility to gastrointestinal diseases  .

In addition chemical and enzy- matic pretreatments combined with appropriate lectins have been addressed to both localize sialylated glycan sequences and clarify the degree and position of acetylated substituents in sialic acid residues .The finding of distinct modifications in the intestinal gly- coconjugates in response to a particular dietary pattern such as starch might provide new insights into the suggested rela- tion between diet intestinal microenvironment and colonic dysfunction.Materials and methodsAnimalsEleven-twelve-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats Morini Reggio Emilia Italy were kept in the Univer- sity's Animal Care Facility they were housed in plas- tic cages with wire tops and bottoms and maintained at constant environmental temperature 20-22 degC on a 12 h light-dark cycle according to internationally accepted guidelines.

The question arises from the knowledge that dietary factors by providing substrates for the intestinal microbiota influence the intestinal microenvironment and the functional effi- ciency of the mucosal barrier  .

DOI 10.1007s00394-017-1393-3Starch-enriched diet modulates the glucidic profile in the rat colonic mucosaMaria Gabriella Gabrielli1  Daniele Tomassoni1Received 1 August 2016  Accepted 2 February 2017  Published online 9 April 2017c Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017AbstractPurpose The protective function of the intestinal mucosa largely depends on carbohydrate moieties that as a part of glycoproteins and glycolipids form the epithelial glycoca- lyx or are secreted as mucins.

The large spectrum of modifications detected with respect to the control animals demonstrates the critical contribution of dietary factors to intestinal glycosylation in rats with a possible impact on the protective function of the intesti- nal mucosa.Acknowledgements Funding was provided by University of Cam- erino Grant no FAR 2014-15.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.ReferencesLee YK Puong KY 2002 Competition for adhesion between probiotics and human gastrointestinal pathogens in the presence of carbohydrate.

Altered glycosylation pat- terns of the intestinal mucosa in particular the expression of certain sialylated sugar chains as well as changes of sialic acid O-acetylation have been associated with inflammatory intestinal disorders and colorectal adenomas and carcinomas -.

Other glycosylation changes tend not to correlate so well with glycosyltransferase activity and could be a consequence of bacterial metabolism or a result of the ongoing inflammatory response.Even the contribution of dietary factors to this critical intestinal environment still requires to be fully clarified also to identify appropriate modifications of the diet that may protect the intestinal mucosa from various diseases.

In sev- eral species experimental data pointed out the potential of dietary factors in affecting morphological features and crypt- villus architecture of the large intestinal epithelium cell pro- liferation and the thickness and chemical characteristics of the intestinal mucus layer -.

To provide additional data on the effects of starch on the intestinal micro- environment we aimed here to verify whether a long-term feeding on a high starch diet can affect the glucidic profile of the colonic mucosa of rats.

Since the classic histological stud- ies on germ-free animals the intestinal bacteria have been recognized to play an essential role in driving the matura- tion of the colonic mucosa and normal mucus production  .
