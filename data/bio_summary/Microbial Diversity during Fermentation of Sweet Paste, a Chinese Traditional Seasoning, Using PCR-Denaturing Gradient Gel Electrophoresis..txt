This study has used the PCR-DGGE technique to demonstrate the microbial community including bacteria and fungi in sweet paste and provides useful information biochemical properties about the assessment of the quality of sweet paste throughout fermentation.Keywords Sweet paste PCR-DGGE microbial diversity fermentationIntroductionSweet paste a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of flour by fungi and bacteria has been consumed for centuries as a flavoring ingredient and as the most important condiment of Beijing roast duck in China.

A total of 84 volatile compounds have been identified from the Chinese fermented flour paste a kind of sweet paste using simultaneous distillation and extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 1.

Recently PCR-DGGE has been used to investigate the microbial communities involved in many foods or seasonings such as soy sauce 7 kimchi Korean fermented cabbage 8 doenjang Korean fermented soybean paste 9 soybean paste 10 daqu Chinese liquor fermentation starter 11 wine and vinegar 12 13.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the microbial diversity of a traditional Chinese sweet paste using PCR- DGGE and analyze the changes in its biochemical properties during fermentation.Materials and MethodsSampling ProceduresKoji and mash samples were collected from a sweet paste factory fJloiautraiC40odeg.C L-t4d5.degCh4in5a.-A50pprof imoaitsetluyr1e0c0o0ntkegnotf wstaesamineodcuwlahteeadt wdriyth wAh.

As the esters produced by fungal enzymes are responsible for the pleasant flavor and aroma of paste 34 all these fungi could be important for the sweet paste flavor.Bacterial Composition in Koji and MashFig.

ChinaThe aim of this study was to elucidate the changes in the microbial community and biochemical properties of a traditional sweet paste during fermentation.

The 180-day fermented sweet paste contained261.46 - 19.49 gkg reducing sugar and its pH value remained at around 4.65.

Owing to its unique and delicious sweet taste with a slight and particular caramel flavor sweet paste has also been used as a cooking sauce for dishes such as diced pork fillet or as a dip for green Chinese onion and noodles 1.

After about 6 months of aging a red-brown flour sauce called sweet paste is produced.
