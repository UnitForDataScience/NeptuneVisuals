Based on these results research above rabbits fed with the diet of 106 CFU g-1 B. subtilis were chosen for the following assays.immune Organ indexAs shown in  the relative weights of the thymus and spleen were significantly increased by diet with B. subtilis after 5 weeks of feeding.

Similarly the expression of DEFB127 DEFB 128 and DEFB 134 upregulated by 2.5- 2.6- and 2.3-fold respectively after stimulation with live B. subtilisP  0.05 which were not obviously changed after stimulation with killed cells.survival rateThe survival rate of rabbits fed B. subtilis was significantly higher than the controls after the E. coli challenge.

Rabbits fed a diet of 107 CFU g-1 B. subtilis did not grow as well as those fed with 106 CFU g-1 perhaps because nutrients in the gut of rabbits was absorbed by the addition of B. subtilis.

To the best of our knowledge this research is the first report on the innate immune response to B. subtilis in rabbits.In return the survival rate of rabbits fed B. subtilis was higher than that of the controls after they were challenged with E. coli.

B. subtilis may be competitive exclusion approaches in the control of infec- tion with enteric pathogens.In conclusion the five B. subtilis that were selected for in vitro experiment showed good probiotic potential in rabbits.

Previous reports have demonstrated that Bacillus subtilis B. subtilis was a potential probiotic for animals.

In this research 180 B. sub- tilis were isolated from the soil identified and investigated in vitro.

Rabbits with a diet of 106 CFU g-1 mixed B. subtilis exhibited the best growth performance andhigher serum IgG and IgA than controls P  0.05.

Moreover dairy with B. subtilis can promote the balance of intestinal flora.

After 7 weeks of feeding the survival rate of the rabbits fed with B. subtilis was significantly higher than those in the control groups postinfected with Escherichia coli.
