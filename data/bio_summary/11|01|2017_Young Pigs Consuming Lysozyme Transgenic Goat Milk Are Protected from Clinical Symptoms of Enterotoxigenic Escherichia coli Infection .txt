Animals used for dairy production such as cattle and goats express 1600-3000 times less lysozyme than humans 400 mgL in human milk 0.25 mgL in goat milk and 0.13 mgL in bovine milk making it a poor source of this antimicrobial protein 17-19.Because of the beneficial properties of lysozyme genetically engineered GE dairy goats that secrete human lysozyme hLZ in the mammary gland during lactation were created using pronuclear microinjection 20.

The herd of hLZ-GE dairy goats expresses 270 mgmL hLZ in milk or 68 of the level found in human milk with no other gross compositional differences in protein or fat relative to nontransgenic goat milk 21.

Fecal samples were collected at baseline n  22 from pigs infected with ETEC with no milk supplementation NM n  22 and at necropsy from pigs infected with ETEC and treated with pasteurized goat milk IGM n  12 or pigs infected with ETEC and treated with hLZ milk IhLZM n  10 after infection was established.

GM goat milk hLZM human lysozyme milk.DiscussionPigs fed hLZ milk had less severe clinical diarrhea which supports the primary hypothesis that consuming hLZ milk can protect against ETEC infection.

In a previous study in which pigs were dosed with ETEC before receiving milk pigs fed hLZ milk had lower IL8 expression than pigs fed goat milk 25 which we did not see in this study.

The significant differences we found in gene expression of MUC1 and TNFa and approaching significant differences in CLDN1 IL10 and TLR4 were also not seen in the previous studies with healthy pigs fed milk of pigs fed ETEC before receiving milk 24 25.Pigs fed goat milk had 2.5 times more total CFUs per gramin liver tissue and nearly 6 times more total CFUs per gram in mesenteric lymph nodes than did hLZM pigs.

Consumption of breast milk has been shown to prevent intestinal infections and is a recommended treatment for infants with diarrhea.Objective This study aimed to examine the ability of lysozyme-rich goat milk to prevent intestinal infection.

Furthermore breast milk positively impacts and modulates the developing intestinal mucosa immune system and micro- biota of infants and much of these effects are attributed to the presence of antimicrobials including lysozyme in milk 12-16.

Milk from hLZ-GE goats was bacteriostatic in vitro against bacterial isolates including E. coli and spoilage of hLZ milk was reduced compared with milk from nontransgenic control goats which presents a benefit for regions with little or no access to refrigeration 22.
