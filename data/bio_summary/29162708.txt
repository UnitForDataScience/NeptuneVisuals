The PGs that supported the growth of L. acidophilus were uti- lized poorly or not at all by other common HGM strains underscoring the metabolic specialization of L. acidophilus.

Phenotypic growth assays of L. acidophilus NCFM and its knockout variants were performed in biological triplicates whereas the growth screening of other L. acidophilus strains or other Lactobacillus species was performed in biological duplicates.

acidophilus were utilized poorly or not at all by other common HGM strains underscoring the metabolic specialization of L. acidophilus.

Conservation of the loci in selected lactobacilli from the L. delbrueckii group and the amino acid sequence identities relative to L. acidophilus NCFM are shown.

The PG utilization loci are conserved in L. acidophilus and closely related lactobacilli in cor- relation with versatile growth on these compounds.

To a lesser extent lactobacilli also possess ATP-binding cassette ABC importers for uptake of nutrients and ABC exporters for which the specificities of most are unknown.Here we demonstrate the growth of L. acidophilus NCFM on chemically diverse and nutritionally relevant PG.

The PG utilization loci are conserved in the L. acidophilus species and closely related lactobacilli and correlate with versatile growth on these com- pounds.

These findings highlight the role of human gut L. acidophilus and select lactobacilli in modulating the availability and bioactivity of glycoconjugated phytochemicals and these modulations are likely to have an important impact on the HGM and their host.RESULTSL.

The growth of L. acidophilus NCFM was evaluated on 11 chemically diverse nutritionally relevant andor therapeutically active PG after 24 h of growth  see Table S1 in the supplemental material.

The compounds that support growth of L. acidophilus are shown in green.
