TMAO may also pre- vent wound repair responses through PKC and NF-kB signal- ing while enhancing macrophage adhesion  .In humans disease associations with TMAO precursor molecules such as choline and L-carnitine were found to be highly dependent on downstream levels of TMAO as an indi- cator molecule for an altered gut microbiota   .

More importantly circulating blood levels of TMAO and related metabolites would be helpful to confirm alterations induced by colonization of these methanogens.Although numerous observational studies have found that high TMAO levels are associated with increased cardiovascu- lar disease to date there have been few studies that have directly tested whether if altering TMAO levels modify car- diovascular risk.

Recognition that TMAO may also have direct detrimental biologic mechanisms originated from a metabolomic screen that identified structurally similar phosphatidylcholine metab- olites choline betaine and TMAO to be significantly associ- ated with cardiovascular disease.

Identified metabolites were subjected to a second validation cohort of 25 case- control matches prior to final confirmation in an independent patient cohort n  1876 of stable patients undergoing elec-tive cardiac evaluations .The causal link between TMAO and atherosclerosis was demonstrated through the findings that choline or TMAO sup- plementation in ApoE-- mice results in enhanced macro- phage foam cell formation in artery walls as well as the peri- toneal cavity .

Clearly fish intake especially deep sea fish is associated with detectable increase in urinary TMAO excretion yet with adequate renal function the rise in TMAO levels is transient usually in a few hours' time before returning to its steady state.

A recent study conducted by investigators associated with manufacturers of L-carnitine supplements has suggested that that L-carnitine feeding and increased TMAO associate with lower rather than higher aortic atheroma lesions as con- trarian evidence towards the potential harms of high L-Table 1Summary of clinical investigations between TMAO and cardiovascular-related outcomes in various patient cohortsStudy cohortAuthorSubjectsStudy population criteriaEndpoint of interestResultsHealthyMeyer et al.

The highest subgroup cutoff of 0.2 ppm TMAO is con- verted to approximately 2.6 mM suggesting that the L-carni- tine feeding in this study was unable to induce significant increases in TMAO potentially due to the choice of male mice.
