The exclusion criteria were as follows1 failure to provide expression data for the microbiota 2 dupli- cate data reported in other studies 3 animal studies intervention studies letters and reviews.Quality assessmentThere is currently no gold-standard quality assessment tool for laboratory studies thus we constructed a new assessment tool based on a diagnostic test We screened for the fol- lowing eight criteria 1 the study population was described including the inclusion and exclusion criteria setting and loca- tions where data were collected 2 the diagnostic standards were described 3 the technical specifications included the materi- als and methods involved how and when measurements were taken and cited references for index tests and reference stan- dards 4 methods for calculating test reproducibility if performed were described 5 the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population e.g.

The search strategy was IBS OR irritable bowel syndrome AND q- PCR OR q-PCR OR real-time AND microbiome OR microbiota OR flora.

Studies were scored according to each applicable criterion as 1 yes 2 no or unclear.Data extractionTwo reviewers independently extracted the following data from all eligible studies 1 basic characteristics of the studies includ- ing name of the first author year of publication country of origin sample size mean age male ratio and diagnostic criteria 2 exper- imental methods including fluorescent dye q-PCR instrument 3 the target species of the primers which were extracted from the included studies and their primary references 4 the effect size of microbiota including mean or median standard deviation or quartile and P values.Fig.
