after 1 week of starvation crabs in the infection group were intramuscularly injected with wssv at a dose of 103 copies 10 ll per crab while 20 crabs in the control group were intramuscularly injected with 10 ll pbs.samplingten crabs injected with pbs were sampled as con- trols and ten crabs from the infection group were sampled at 6 h post-infection hpi and 48 hpi respectively.

7b.at the family level 96 bacterial families were significantly different in abundance between the control and 6 hpi groups 87 families between the control and 48 hpi and 68 families changed pronouncedly between 6 and 48 hpi table s4.figure 5 structure and composition of the gut bacterial communities of eriocheir sinensis at different stages of wssv infection on phylum level of taxonomy.

as the 'secondary' or 'rare' otus actinobacteria was identified from seven crabs in the control group 710 0.1-5.7 six crabs in the 6 hpi group 610 0.1 while only two crabs at 48 hpi 210 0.1 fig.

the 90 crabs were randomly divided into two groups 20 crabs in a control group and 70 crabs in the infection group.

nopathological changes could be observed in the control crabs data not shown whereas the exper- imentally infected crabs showed typical histopathological changes associated with wssv infection in the gut fig.

we monitored the dynamics of epsilonproteobacteria during wssv infection process and our findings implied that members of epsilonproteobacteria may play an important role in antiviral protection.regarding the dramatic changes in the intestinal bacterial community from healthy to diseased crabs one of the most important questions is whether sensitive assemblages could be served as indicators of host health.

in this study we investigated for the first time the changes in gut bacterial populations at two different stages of wssv infection in e. sinensis using an illumina- based high-throughput sequencing method.several types of association between the gut bac- teria and aquatic host animals such as ingested transient and resident populations are possible and many factors such as the internal structure diet host conditions habitat and season can affectthe gut bacteria of aquatic invertebrates goffredi et al.

we investigated the changes in composition and structure of the crab gut microbiome during various wssv infection stages of 6 h post-infec- tion hpi and 48 hpi using a 16s rrna approach on the miseq illumina sequencing plat- form.
