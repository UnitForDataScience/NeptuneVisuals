After 1 week of starvation crabs in the infection group were intramuscularly injected with WSSV at a dose of 103 copies 10 lL per crab while 20 crabs in the control group were intramuscularly injected with 10 lL PBS.SamplingTen crabs injected with PBS were sampled as con- trols and ten crabs from the infection group were sampled at 6 h post-infection hpi and 48 hpi respectively.

7b.At the family level 96 bacterial families were significantly different in abundance between the control and 6 hpi groups 87 families between the control and 48 hpi and 68 families changed pronouncedly between 6 and 48 hpi Table S4.Figure 5 Structure and composition of the gut bacterial communities of Eriocheir sinensis at different stages of WSSV infection on phylum level of taxonomy.

As the 'secondary' or 'rare' OTUs Actinobacteria was identified from seven crabs in the control group 710 0.1-5.7 six crabs in the 6 hpi group 610 0.1 while only two crabs at 48 hpi 210 0.1 Fig.

The 90 crabs were randomly divided into two groups 20 crabs in a control group and 70 crabs in the infection group.

6a-c Table S2.Additionally 55 bacterial orders changed signif- icantly in abundance at 6 hpi 45 orders at 48 hpi and 44 orders differed significantly between 6 and 48 hpi Fig.

5c Spiro- chaetes was detected from nine crabs in the control group 910 0.1-3.7 while only identified from five crabs in the 48 hpi group 510 0.1- 2.7 Fig.

This study pre- sented for the first time that major changes in the crab gut bacterial community coincided with virus infection.Materials and methodsExperimental animalsNinety Chinese mitten crabs E. sinensis with a mean body weight of 91.42 - 8.76 g 48 males and 42 females were used for the experiment.

abundance of species of highly diverse bacterial communities.In this study we used a 16S rRNA approach on the MiSeq Illumina sequencing platform to investigate the structure dynamics of gut bacterial communities in the freshwater crab E. sinensis subject to challenge with WSSV.

2012 whereas far fewer studies have focused on crustaceans including crabs despite the fact that crabs are major agricul- tural products with high economic value worldwide.Interactions between bacteria and their host rep- resent a full continuum from pathogenicity to mutualism and are no longer considered a two- component system but rather a complex network of associations Boutin et al.
