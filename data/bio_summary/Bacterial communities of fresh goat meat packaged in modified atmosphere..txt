Meat samples were stored at 10 oC under two different modified-atmosphere packing MAP conditions treatment A had 45 CO2 th 20 O2 th 35 N2 and treatment B had 20 CO2 th 55 O2 th 25 N2.

At lower temperatures CO2 has greater inhibitory effect probably due to the increased solubility of CO2 .

However although concentrations of CO2 close to 100 extend the storage period by controlling spoilage bacteria CO2 has a negative effect on the texture appearance and colour stability of raw meat when compared to other gas mixtures .

Packaging was carried out in two types of modifiedatmospheresTreatment A 45 CO2 th 20 O2 th 35 N2 Treatment B 20 CO2 th 55 O2 th 25 N2Samples from each animal were included in both treatments.

One way to increase the shelf life of meat is via cold conservation under modified atmosphere packing MAP in which packaging occurs under variable gas mixtures mainly O2 CO2 and N2.

According to  high levels of CO2 enhance the growth of LAB and inhibit the growth of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas but do not prevent the growth of B. thermosphacta.
