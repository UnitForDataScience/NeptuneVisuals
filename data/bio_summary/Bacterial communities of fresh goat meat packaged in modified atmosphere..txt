was predominant in treatment b high o2 making up 80 of the identified isolates and was followed by h. alvei at 15. by contrast in treatment a high co2 h. alvei was clearly the dominant species .

the mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts were about 3.5 log cfug at the initial time point 0 days and after 14 days of storage increased to 7.03 log cfug for treatment a and 8.23 log cfug for treatment b. samples under treatment b reached 7 log cfug after 9 days of storage which is commonly reported as the threshold for acceptable quality meat  .

at lower temperatures co2 has greater inhibitory effect probably due to the increased solubility of co2 .

however although concentrations of co2 close to 100 extend the storage period by controlling spoilage bacteria co2 has a negative effect on the texture appearance and colour stability of raw meat when compared to other gas mixtures .

treatment a which had a higher co2 concentration lead to significantly lower counts of mesophilic aerobic and psychro- trophic bacteria after 9 and 14 days of storage whereas enter- obacteria and coliform growth were significant slower after 4 days.

thus there was less microbial growth in the treatment with the higher co2 concentration demonstrating the effectiveness of this gas for controlling bacterial growth in meat packaged under modified atmosphere.

interestingly the higher co2 concentration in treatment a led to a reduction of approximately one logarithmic unit in counts of enterococci at the end of the storage time period.

the lower populations observed in treatment a can be attributed to the higher co2 concentration.

are usually associated with high o2 atmospheres ade s. proteamaculans and s. liquefaciens have also been detected at high levels in samples packaged under atmospheres with concentrations of co2 similar to that used in treatment a .

in map conditions rich in o2 eurade .in conclusion the results of our conventional microbiological analysis reveal that the map condition used in treatment a composed of 45 co2 20 o2 35 n2 was the most effective gas composition for increasing the shelf life of fresh goat meat to 14 days.
