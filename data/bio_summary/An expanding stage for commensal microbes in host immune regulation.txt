It should be noted that these cells did not appear to be limited to the gut and might present an intestinal regulation exerted by a systemic Treg population.Gut microbiota and peripheral immune system development In addition to their roles in lymphocyte tuning and polariza- tion the gut microbiota is essential to the establishment of secondary lymphoid organs SLO.

In the presence of microbiota they converted to mature ILFs in a CCR7- dependent manner.2 Peptidoglycan from Gram-negative strains signaled through NOD1 and induced robust develop- ment of ILFs also in a CCR7-dependent fashionsuggesting that it is an active factor from the microbiota for ILF induction.

Although these analyses demonstrated the importance of DCs in supporting peripheral lymphoid volume they did not indicate any gut microbiota involvement.Regarding the missing link to the microbiota we recently reported an interesting mechanism in neonatal mice up to 4 weeks of age specifically a group of gut-originated CD103CD11b DCs expressing RALDH2 was driven by the micro- biota and traveled to peripheral LNs leading to local RA production.

Apparently butyrate also stabilized Foxp3 expression as a consequence of HDAC inhibition.Similar findings have been reported by Furusawa et al.
