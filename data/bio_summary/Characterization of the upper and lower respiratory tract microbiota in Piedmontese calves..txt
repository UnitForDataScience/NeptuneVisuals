The type I error with a significance at 0.05 was  0.001 as was the type II error providing a power  90.There were 741 OTUs with a statistically significant difference in abundance as assessed by DESeq2 analysis details given in Additional file with 19 more abundant in the TTA microbiota and 722 in the NS one.Table 2 Alpha diversity indexes calculated for the nasal swab NS and trans-tracheal aspiration TTA samplesChao1 index observed species Shannon's diversity index and Simpson index values are reported as mean - standard errorCorrelation of microbiota composition of NS and TTA fluid samples in relation to clinical status and farm of origin Comparison of the microbiota composition of the TTA samples by farm of origin showed no statistically significant difference for this factor Adonis on either Bray-Curtis dissimilarity weighted UniFrac or unweighted UniFrac distance P  0.05.

In upper respiratory tract disease there is an increased liquid flow from the nose with a higher potential to affect the lung microbiota as a consequence .Analysis of respiratory tract samples obtained from the dog led to the hypothesis for a self-sustaining lung microbiota also in this species which proved to be much more homogeneous than the composition of the oral or nasal microbiota In the present study the trans- tracheal approach was used for the collection of samples from the lower respiratory tract in order to minimize the contamination from the upper respiratory ways.

DNA metabarcoding analysis of pathological respiratory samples led to the hy- pothesis that alteration of the lung microbiota could as- sume a key role in the pathogenesis of human lung diseases including bacterial pneumonia .Study of the bovine respiratory tract holds huge im- portance because one of the main health issues in the cattle industry is infectious bronchopneumonia defined as bovine respiratory disease BRD  In Europe BRD is associated with high morbidity and mortality which leads to a widespread use of antimicrobials and therefore increases the alarm about antibiotic resistance - BRD is a multifactorial disease resulting from interactions between management physiologic and en- vironmental factors and etiological agents  The bacterial pathogens most often identified by culture- based methods in the course of BRD are Mannheimia haemolytica Pasteurella multocida Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis Considered ubiquitous in- habitants of the bovine upper respiratory tract these bacterial species can proliferate in the lungs when in- haled during stressful events or viral infections However they have also been isolated from the lower re- spiratory tract of calves not presenting clinical signs raising questions about their role in the development of BRD A better understanding of the etiology of BRD is critical to improve animal health.In cattle 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to characterize the microbiota of the upper respiratory tract has been ap- plied on nasal swab samples from dairy and beef calves 2-.

isolated P. multocida from TTA samples obtained from clinically healthy animals.The absence of a significant difference in lower microbiota composition between healthy and BRD-affected calves suggests that P. multocida could be part of the microbial flora of the lower respiratory tract of healthy animals.Our results showed significant differences in alpha diversity and beta diversity between the upper and the lower respiratory tract microbiota the number of species composing the lower respiratory tract micro- biota was lower and these species differed by abun- dance and type from the upper respiratory tract microbiota.

This suggests that the lower respiratory tract microbiota may be more homogeneous and resilient than the upper respiratory tract in agreement with the results found in the dog Moreover these findings strengthen the hypothesis for a self-sustaining lower re- spiratory tract microbiota also in cattle.The absence of significant differences in the bacterial species recovered from the NS and TTA samples from the healthy and the BRD-affected calves contrasts with previous results obtained in humans and cattle Since BRD is a syndrome and not a single disease with a linear etiology it may manifest clinically and microbio- logically in several different forms Various otherfactors could have influenced our results and precluded differentiation between the microbiota of a diseased lung and that of a healthy one.

Four other genera with a relative abundance higher than 1 were identified Sphingomonas 1.2 1.1- 0.6 Mannheimia 1.2 0.9 - 0.9 Aggregatibacter1.2 0.5 - 0.6 and Bacteroides 1.1 1.2 - 1.7.Mycoplasma was the most abundant genus in both the NS and the TTA fluid samples with a relative abundance of27.2 35.1 - 6.9 and 76.5 72.9 - 5.5 respect-ively followed by Moraxella 16.6 5.9 - 4.8 in the NS samples and by Pasteurella 7.3 7.6 - 3.7 in the TTA samples.

Overall 123 out of 305 genera were found only in the NS samples and 16 genera only in the TTA sam- ples Additional file  Table S1.Considering only the OTUs assigned at the species level Pasteurella multocida 7.3 of total OTUs 7.6 - 3.7 was the most abundant in the TTA fluid samples and Psychrobacter sanguinis 1.1 of total OTUs 1.5- 0.6 in the NS samples.

A more probable explanation is that these genera were more abundant in the NS samples because of environmental contamination of the upper respiratory tract rather than contamination occurring during the samples' analysis due to low biomass.Overall the most abundant genus identified was Myco- plasma which was abundantly found in all NS and TTA samples.

Comparison of the NS and TTA samples by farm origin and clinical signs revealed no statistical difference P  0.05 except for farm origin for the NS samples when compared by the unweighted UniFrac metric P  0.05.Conclusions Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing we characterized the microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory tracts of calves both healthy individuals and those with clinical signs of respiratory disease.
