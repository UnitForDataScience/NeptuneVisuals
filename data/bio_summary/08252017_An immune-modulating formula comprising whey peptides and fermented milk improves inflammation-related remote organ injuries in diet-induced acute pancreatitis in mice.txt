However whereas mice were fed the CDE diet throughout the experiment in most previous studies 19 little has been reported about whether or not systemic inflammation persisted and subsequent remote organ injuries occurred after feeding with the CDE diet ended The present study showed for the first time that CDE diet-induced pancreatitis led to remote organ injuries such as splenomegaly and hepatomegaly which were also seen in severe acute pancreatitis in clinical settings.

These dietswere lyophilized and then vacuum-packed and refrigerated with an oxygen absorber and desiccants until administration to avoid rotting and oxidation.Diet-induced severe acute pancreatitisTo induce severe acute pancreatitis in mice we used a choline-deficient diet supplemented with 0.5 ethionine CDE diet.

The experimental pancreatitis induced by feeding with the CDE diet has already been established In this model acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced that was accompanied by systemic inflammatory responses and peripancreatic organ injury 18.

Acute pancreatitis is a potentially lethal disease with a wide variation of clinical features and severity Most patients have a mild form of the disease and recover but some patients develop severe acute pancreatitis SAP with a poor prognosis and high mortality.

In clinical settings serum MCP- 1 has been reported to increase in patients with complicated acute pancreatitis and MCP-1 has been thought to play a pivotal role in the pathological mechanism of complicated pancreatitis 25.

Risperidone attenuates local and systemic inflammatory responses to ameliorate diet-induced severe necrotic pancreatitis in mice it may provide a new therapy for acute pancreatitis.

p0.05 vs. control group.to play key roles in the pathogenesis and progression of acute pancreatitisand systemic inflammation has been known as a cause of remote organ injuries in SAP as well as the early predictor of severity in human acute pancreatitis 22.

The present study demonstrated that remote organ injuries represented as splenomegaly hepatomegaly and elevationof hepatic enzymes developed and were accompanied by acute pancreatitis induced by feeding with the CDE diet.

Mice were fasted for 12 hours and then fed a choline-deficient and ethionine-supplemented diet CDE diet for 24 hours to induce pancreatitis.

The use of an inflammation- modulating diet in patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome a meta-analysis of outcome data.
