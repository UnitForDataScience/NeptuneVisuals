Obesity is associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM obesity represents 90-95 of patients with diabetes11 hyperten- sion hyperlipidemia pancreatic diseases nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and several specific can- cers.12 A high mortality rate is reported not only in pa- tients with morbid obesity but also in overweight subjects.13 Obesity is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and contributes to all-cause mortal- ity.1114 Moreover T2DM and central obesity are both present in the metabolic syndrome.15-17 The proportion of American adults with obesity reached 50 in 201318 and current healthcare costs for obesity-associated conditions were USD 147 billion in the USA.19 The economic costsDOI10.560401.3001.0010.5499Table 1.

To explain the improved T2DM incretins secretion and incretin-mediated effects have been evaluated in patients after the most common bariatric surgical procedures especially following RYG- BP.31 The incretin dependent mechanisms were firstly ob- served after gastric bypass and the more extensive is the intestinal bypass the greater are the nutritional and meta- bolic effects.108Changes of gut microbiota occurring after bariatric sur- gery should be also taken into account when interpreting the beneficial metabolic outcomes of the surgery.34 In ani- mals RYGBP modifies the gut microbiota profile of the alimentary limb and the common channel similarly to those induced by prebiotic treatment or body weight loss by dieting.35 An extensive review on the effects of surgical- ly induced body weight loss on the human gut microbiota suggested the presence of an overabundance of Proteobacte- ria in the distal gut microbiota after RYGBP which is dis- tinct from changes seen in body weight loss without the surgery.37 Modifications of the gut microbiota can ulti- mately affect both BA metabolism and likely metabolic pathways.CHANGES IN BA METABOLISM AFTER BARIATRIC SURGERYCurrent research has attracted the attention to the addi- tional effects of BAs beyond their physiological digestive function in bile.109 Such additional effects depict BAs as metabolic mediators of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity which can also explain some effects of bariatric surgery independently from simple body weight loss.

b-cell function in T2DM remain slower 70 compared to that in subjects with normal glucose tolerance93 and undergo- ing duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery despite normal HbA1c levels.Current views strongly suggest that the beneficial ef- fects of bariatric surgery are related to the combination of short-term effects of caloric restriction94 and long-termeffect on body weight loss95 with a number of hormones acting metabolically on distinctive pathways.14 There are two mechanisms that may provide the physiological inter- pretation of the beneficial effects of bariatric surgeryAccording to the foregut hypothesis some unspeci- fied factors acting on the diabetic profile may not be released when nutrients are not in contact anymore with the duodenum9697 andThe hindgut hypothesis by contrast proposes that the rapid transit of nutrients towards the distal intes- tine may increase the L-enterocyte mediated secretion of GLP-1 with anti-diabetic effects even for a long time.9899Notably the GLP-1 increase might be mediated by the increased enterohepatic circulation and serum levels of to- tal BAs which now appear as important mediators of some beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.100The amount of pancreatic fat is significantly higher in T2DM and in obese subjects than in control subjects and the reduction following bariatric surgery is associated with improved insulin resistance indices and b-cell func- tion.93 Furthermore bariatric surgery reverses the incre- ment of the natural killer lymphocytes seen in obese patients with insulin resistance.

However the indications to bariatric sur- gery have changed substantially in the last 10 years and in the last five years it has been claimed as an option not only for morbid obesity but also as ultimate treatment of T2DM in patients with less severe degree of obesity.3177- 8286 Long-term studies however have shown reappearance of diabetes in spite of bariatric surgery.87The main indications and contraindications to bariatric surgical procedures are listed in table 3 while a comment-Mainly restrictive and partially malabsorptive.

In a group of Spanish adults it has been demonstrated that more than a quarter 29 of the subjects were considered lean and over two-thirds 80 were considered overweight on the basis of their BMI that shows a percentage of body fat within the obesity range cut-off values for obesity were 29 kgm2 in males and 30 kgm2 in females.21Current obesity therapy involves lifestyles i.e.

This view is supported by studies that investigated the mechanisms regulating the differentiation process of adipocytes and their active involvement in systemic events.38 Thus the effect of treating obesity and its influ- ence on metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers have gained increasing interest.1238 The development of excess white fatty tissues in specific regions of the body is meta- bolically more relevant factor for obesity than the in- creased BMI per se.

Also in the Genesis fat cows were in- deed called bari cows.83 Other sources indicate that bar- iatric comes from two words of the modern Greek baros and iatrikos meaning load and medicine respectively.83The National Institute of Health NIH issued the ini- tial indications for bariatric surgery in 1991 and more re- cently the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery EAES and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariat- ric Surgery ASBS added novel indications and recom- mended bariatric surgery also for subjects displaying mild obesity Class 1 associated with severe comorbidities in- cluding T2DM.8485 Category of patients and procedures should be chosen depending on local availability selection criteria and surgeon's experience Table 2.

The beneficial effect of bariatric surgery is not simply secondary to the me- chanical restriction of the stomach or to malabsorption of nutrients since bariatric surgical procedures are able to positively modify more complex key pathways.

central obesity is indeed associated with increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.11 Waist cir- cumference becomes the anthropometric marker of cen- tral obesity as a reliable indicator of visceral fat content.39Obesity has been considered as the consequence of an impaired balance between energy intake and energy ex- penditure but current views are far more complicated.
