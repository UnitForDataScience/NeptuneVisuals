b-cell function in t2dm remain slower 70 compared to that in subjects with normal glucose tolerance93 and undergo- ing duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery despite normal hba1c levels.current views strongly suggest that the beneficial ef- fects of bariatric surgery are related to the combination of short-term effects of caloric restriction94 and long-termeffect on body weight loss95 with a number of hormones acting metabolically on distinctive pathways.14 there are two mechanisms that may provide the physiological inter- pretation of the beneficial effects of bariatric surgeryaccording to the foregut hypothesis some unspeci- fied factors acting on the diabetic profile may not be released when nutrients are not in contact anymore with the duodenum9697 andthe hindgut hypothesis by contrast proposes that the rapid transit of nutrients towards the distal intes- tine may increase the l-enterocyte mediated secretion of glp-1 with anti-diabetic effects even for a long time.9899notably the glp-1 increase might be mediated by the increased enterohepatic circulation and serum levels of to- tal bas which now appear as important mediators of some beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.100the amount of pancreatic fat is significantly higher in t2dm and in obese subjects than in control subjects and the reduction following bariatric surgery is associated with improved insulin resistance indices and b-cell func- tion.93 furthermore bariatric surgery reverses the incre- ment of the natural killer lymphocytes seen in obese patients with insulin resistance.
