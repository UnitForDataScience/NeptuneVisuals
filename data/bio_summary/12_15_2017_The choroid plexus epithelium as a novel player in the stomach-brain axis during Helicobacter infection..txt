Data were analysed by Student's T-test n  4-5. b Concentration of sTNFR1 in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF of control mice and mice infected with H. suis n  10. c Expression of inflammatory genes Il1b Kc Il6 and Tnf in the hippocampus of C57BL6 mice infected with H. suis compared to control mice represented as fold change.

a H. suis colonization in the stomach corpus and antrum and duodenum of C57BL6 mice one month after H. suis infection compared to control mice n  7-10. b-c Representative HE images of stomach sections of control b and H. suis-infected c C57BL6 mice one month after infection.

a Analysis of the presence of H. suis determined by RT- qPCR on corpus and hippocampus tissue derived from C57BL6 mice one month after H. suis infection compared and control mice n  6-10. b-f Representative images of the stomach b positive control choroid plexus c-d and hippocampus e-f stained for Helicobacter in sections from control and H. suis-infected mice.

In contrast no significant changes in the expression of cytokines andchemokines were found in the duodenum of mice infected with H. suis g.Gastric H. suis infection induces inflammation and activation of microglia in the brainTo determine whether H. suis affects the brain cerebrospinal fluid CSF and brain tissue were analysed for inflammation.

In contrast no H. suis DNA was detected in the stomach of control mice a. Additionally H. suis DNA was also detected in the duodenum of infected mice but to a lower extent than in the stomach a.Analysis of HE-stained stomach of control animals showed no or negligible infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells in the mucosa and the submucosa which agrees with the normal histological image of the stomach b.

Additionally H. suis can be present and survive in minced pork suggesting that raw or undercooked pork may be a source of H. suis infection in humans .Recently an exceptionally high frequency 27 of H. suis DNA was found in gastric biopsies from human patients with Parkinson's disease compared to a control group with no clinical0889-1591c 2017 Elsevier Inc.
