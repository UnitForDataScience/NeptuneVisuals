When comparing the bacterial community of HK banknotes with other HK environmental samples including water and marine sediment we revealed that HK banknotes cover nearly 50 of total genera found in all the environmental samples implying that banknotes harbor diverse bacteria originated from a variety of environments.

Lastly we integrated our biological data with different city network metrics such as connectivity analysis population densities and physical locations to investigate the influence of anthropogenic factors on the microbiome that we are exposed through the daily handling of banknotes.RESULTSMicrobial Community on HK BanknotesHK 20 notes were collected from cashiers at 12 hospitals and three metro stations located in three geographical regions of HK HK Island HKI Kowloon KL New Territories NT Figure 1A.

However much more intensive sampling is needed to confirm whether this pattern of homogenization could be confirmed.16S rRNA-Based Comparison of HK Banknotes and Other Environmental SamplesTo highlight the unique characteristics of HK banknotes we performed a comparison with other HK environmental samples collected from residents' palms Wilkins et al.

These results imply that the HK banknotes harbor various types of bacteria from different environmental niches and provide one more piece of evidence that due to their high circulation banknotes may be a good representation of the most prominent members of a city's microbiome.Taxonomic and Functional Comparison of Banknotes and Other Environmental Samples Based on Shotgun MetagenomesTo investigate in higher resolution the taxonomic composition and functionality of microbes present in banknotes compared to other environmental samples we retrieved publicly available shotgun metagenomic sequencing data from Indian banknotes HK water samples and HK marine sediment samples.

2015.We also observed that the HK banknotes harbor more diverse bacteria compared with other HK environmental samples.

The accumulation curve of the genera richness among different environmental samples reveals that the HK banknotes contribute around half of the total genera in all HK environmental samples Figure 2B Figure S5.

Furthermore we noticed that around 60 of identifiable genera from the HK banknotes were unique compared with the palm and MTR air samples nearly half of the genera found on the HK banknotes were unique compared to the water and marine sediment samples Figure 2C.

Thiopeptide is a sulfur-rich highly modified heterocyclic peptide antibiotic drug and oligosaccharide is known as a substrate for some bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids.A Comparative Analysis of HK and Indian BanknotesWe subsequently investigated the differentially abundant species between the HK and Indian banknotes.

For example the discovery of the higher abundance of marine bacteria in the HK banknotes than Indian banknotes Figure S8 is due to the fact that HK is surrounded by the ocean while New Delhi where the Indian samples were collected is in central India.

In this study we made a comprehensive characterization of the bacterial community present on banknotes collected from different geographical regions of Hong Kong HK by performing in vitro characterization of the bacterial presence and resistome profile as well as metagenomic analysis including microbial diversity the prevalence of potential pathogens the dissemination potential of antibiotic-resistance genes ARGs among others.
