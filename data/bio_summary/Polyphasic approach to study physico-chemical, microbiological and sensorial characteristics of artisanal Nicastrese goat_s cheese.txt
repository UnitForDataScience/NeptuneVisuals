All analyses were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as per- centage  of total area.Sensory analysisIn order to evaluate the sensory characteristics of the 60 days ripened cheeses made from the four different farms Ch I Ch II Ch III and Ch IV the sensory profile method  was performed.

Regarding the cheeses' gross composition Ch II showed the highest value of moisture 29.15 g100 g while protein fat and salt were achieved at the highest concentration in Ch III sample.Microbiological characterization of Nicastrese cheese by culturing methodThe mean values expressed as log10 cfug or ml and standard deviations of the main microbial groups detected in milk M curdC and 60 days ripened cheese Ch samples provided from the four different farms are showed in .

Moreover acetone and 2-undecanone were detected in low amounts only in Ch I sample 23-butandione only in Ch II sample 2-pentanone and 8-nonen-2- one only in Ch III sample.

Regarding alcohols 2-butanol 2-pentanol 3-methyil-1-butanol and 2 eptanol were revealed only in Ch I sample while 13- butandiol and 23-butandiol were detected in all Ch samples  aldehydes such as nonanal heptanal and 24- heptadienal EE were detected only in Ch II sample.148A.

Regarding cheese texture the firmness was high in both Ch II and Ch III samples and less perceived in Ch I sample which on the contrary exhibited high friability.DiscussionThe present study investigated for the first time the microbi- ological physico-chemical and sensory traits of the Nicastrese goat's cheese manufactured under traditional practices.

Among Ch samples only Ch III showed statistically sig- nificant differences .LAB identificationSeven hundred and twenty isolates from MRS and M17 plates were considered LAB based on their positive Gram reaction non- motility absence of catalase activity and spore formation and rod or coccal shape .

Ch III sample showed the highest fatty acid percentage 51 followed by Ch IV 48.

The latter was mainly perceived in Ch III sample and caprine odour in Ch II sample .

Milk M curd C and ripened 60 days cheese Ch samples were aseptically collected and subjected to microbiological and physico-chemical analysis within 6 h. The analyses were con- ducted in triplicate three independent batches from each farm.Physico-chemical analysesMilk M samples 250 ml from each farm were analyzed to measure fat protein casein lactose non-fat solids urea density citric acid and titration acidity Soxhlet-HenkeloSH using Fourier Transform InfraRed Milkoscan FT2 Foss Electric Sweden cali-brated with appropriate goat milk standards.
