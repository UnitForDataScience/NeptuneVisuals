The L. salivarius lncRNA is smaller than the L. plantarum supermotifs  that are stable transcribed intergenic RNA species with a cruciform structure which the L. salivarius lncRNA is not predicted to assume.

This lncRNA is a unique feature of L. salivarius and its coding sequence was present in 34 of 45 L. salivarius genomes available.

The sequences of the genes of interestfrom all the L. salivarius strains were aligned with Muscle and primers were designed within the conserved areas using the Primer3Plus Web tool Table S1.RNA extraction and reverse transcription- quantitative PCR RT-qPCR analysisFor the lncRNA expression study with L. salivarius UCC118 total RNA was extracted every 2 h from 4 h early exponential phase to 12 h stationary phase and also atTable 1.

The L. salivarius strains were divided into 4 groups  for the strains with very high expression of the lncRNA  for the strains with sequence 100  identical to the L. salivarius UCC118 lncRNA  for the strains harbouring a lncRNA sequence with SNPsgaps - for the strains without a lncRNA sequence in their genome.

The ratio of megaplasmid to chromosome was calcu- lated by using the formula R2geometric mean Ct chromosomal genes - geometric mean Ct megaplasmid genes where C is the cross- ing threshold value.Creation of a lncRNA deletion mutant in L. salivarius UCC118Knock-outs deletion of the lncRNA and deletion of the lncRNA along with the LSL1884 gene of the L. salivarius UCC118 wild-type strain Fig.

Four microarray conditionswere carried out in duplicate wild-type against DlncRNA in exponential phase wild-type against DlncRNA DLSL1884 in exponential phase wild-type against DlncRNA in station- ary phase and wild-type against DlncRNA DLSL1884 in sta- tionary phase.RESULTSA novel lncRNA in L. salivarius UCC118RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of L. salivarius UCC118 was performed in triplicate Fig.

This lncRNA presence in the gut contents of the treated group correlated with the increase of Lactoba- cillus genomic DNA in the same samples .lncRNA is expressed in all L. salivarius strains harbouring the sequence but expression levels varyComparative genomics revealed that the sequence corre- sponding to this newly described lncRNA was uniquely pres- ent in L. salivarius i.e.

L. salivarius UCC119 had the highest expression and L. salivarius JCM1040 had the lowest expression of the lncRNA with more than 45 000-fold differ- ence in expression levels between these two strains.
