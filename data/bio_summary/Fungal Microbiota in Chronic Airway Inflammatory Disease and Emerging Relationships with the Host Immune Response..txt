While this field is still nascent emerging evidence suggests that dysbiotic fungal and bacterial microbiota interact to drive or exacerbate chronic airway inflammatory disease.Keywords airway microbiome airway fungal microbiome mycobiome host-microbiome interactions bacterial- fungal interactions biofilmINTRODUCTIONMicrobial communities associated with host mucosal surfaces play essential and diverse roles in biological processes from metabolism to immune regulation and homeostasis.

In the airways similarities between allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and ABPA illustrate the ability of fungi to act as antigens and invade the respiratory tract.Studies on the fungal microbiome in CRS and asthma suggest that fungal communities in the airways likely influence host health.

A recent study using ITS gene sequencing found fungal presence in the sinuses of 63 of CRS patients and the predominant fungal genus in this study was Aspergillus Zhao et al.

Future studies examining paired upper and lower airway microbiota bacterial and fungal in individuals with CRS and asthma are warranted.Aspergillus fumigatus is often involved in the development of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis AFRS specific subtype CRS that accounts for an estimated 6-9 of all CRS patients undergoing surgery Schubert 2004.

Dectin-1 a pattern recognition receptor expressed by dendritic cells neutrophils and macrophages recognizes the fungal polysaccharide b-13 glucan motif found on fungal cell walls.

Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms for these responses and to determine whether fungal communities in other organs can influence allergic airway disease.FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe evidence for the influence of dysbiotic fungal and bacterial microbiota interactions to drive or exacerbate chronic airwayinflammatory disease is compelling.

Because fungal dysbiosis can have as great an effect on the host as bacterial dysbiosis we cannot overlook the contributions of these largely unexplored fungal communities in our search to understand the microbial mechanisms behind health and disease.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSIZ drafted and revised the manuscript.

While the bacterial microbiome of the upper and lower airways has been the focus of many recent studies the contribution of fungal microbiota to inflammation is an emerging research interest.

Within the context of allergic airway disease fungal products are important allergens and fungi are potent inducers of inflammation.

In addition murine models have provided experimental evidence that fungal microbiota in peripheral organs notably the gastrointestinal GI tract influence pulmonary health.
