These findings indicate that VA also plays a role in the balance of the microbiota barrier.VAD in consumed food or in the blood of children with ASD compared with typically developing TD children or standard values has been reported in several studies - In a previous study we found that deficien- cies in ferritin folate vitamin B12 25OH vitamin D and hemoglobin were not as obvious as deficiencies in VA in children with ASD with the percentage of VAD in ASD as high as 77.9 and the gastrointestinal GI symptoms more common in children with ASD than in TD children.

The proportion of Bacteroidetes was found at high levels in the ASD in several studies although it was not significantly different from the con- trol group in another study  Brent L. Williams assessed the microbiota in the ileum of ASD subjects and found that the proportion of Bacteroidetes decreased and the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio increased in ASD- GI children these findings were correlated with the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter and sucrose isomaltase mRNA levels in the ileum indicating that the decreased proportion of Bacteroidetes in ASD contributed to the impairment of the primary pathway for carbohy- drate digestion in ASD .

This study was performed to investigate the role of VA in the changes of gut microbiota and changes of autism functions in children with ASD.Results Sixty four aged 1 to 8 years old children with ASD completed a 6-month follow-up study with VA intervention.

Moreover we found for the first time that the VA levels were negatively correlated with scores of autism symptoms .Therefore our study aimed to confirm the role of VA on the key gut microbiota and changes in functions in children with ASD.MethodsParticipants and proceduresThis single-blind non-randomized intervention pilot study included a total of 64 children with ASD aged 1 to 8 years old in 6 special training centers in Chongqing.

But finally a subset of 20 of the 64 children were eligible and agreed tocompleted the collections for gut microbiota analysis before and after the VAI.The study protocol was peer reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Children's Hospital Chongqing Medical University in 2013 and registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR registration number .MeasurementsAnthropometric measurementsAnthropometric examinations were conducted by three professional trained anthropometrists from Department of Child Health Care of Children's Hospital according to standard procedures Z-scores were calculated for height-for-age ZHA weight-for-age ZWA and body mass index BMI ZBMIA with WHO Anthro and AnthroPlus software World Health Organization 2009 Anthro for Personal Computers Version 3.01 Software for Assessing Growth and Development of the World's Children.ASD-related symptomsSRS has been significantly correlated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised with a total score of 60 or higher indicating impairment CARS is composed of 15 areas with each area grading from one to four and a total score of 30 or higher indicating a positive result for autism The ABC is a scale of 57 different behaviors and a total score of 53 or higher indicates a probability of childhood autism Food frequency analysisOnly children with ASD who finished the stool sample collection were required to complete the designed food frequency questionnaire which included 18 types of food.

BacteroidetesBacteroidales and Bifidobacterium were perhaps the core microflora related to VA in children with ASD.Changes in the relative amount of Bacteroidetes or Bacteroides in children with ASD have been reported in many studies although the results have differed from study to study.

Significance was reported at P  0.05.ResultsA total of 64 children with ASD were recruited and sub- set of 20 among the 64 children underwent the gut microbiota analysis.

These findings indicated that VA could regulate gut microbiota and benefit children with ASD partly.VA and autism functionsThe potential use of VA treatment and the necessity of clinical trials using VA in ASD were illustrated by Megson in 2000 .

It tended to give a second VAI for children who still had insufficient VA levels after 6 months of the first VAI on the second visit but it failed for multiple reasons details in limitations.Additionally fresh stool samples food frequency ques-tionnaires mealtime behaviors were asked to be collected from participants who did not receive supplemental pro- biotics or prebiotics and who were not treated with antibi- otics for the previous 1 month in the 64 children before and after the VAI for gut microbiota.

An- other study performed probiotic supplementation in children with autism and showed that the Bacteroidetes Firmicutes ratio in the children's feces was normalized and that the relative amount of Bifidobacterium had sig- nificantly decreased  which was similar to the findings in our study.
