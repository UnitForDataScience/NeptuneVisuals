Cytokine responses to S.mitis biofilms did not demonstrate a consistent pattern when compared to multi-species commensal biofilms either in the presence or absence of smoke.Tobacco smoke and mucosal-microbial interactionsSA Shah et al.4Fig.

Recent studies using proteomics and transcriptomics of fibroblas- tic responses to these biofilms also serve to validate the ability of this system to mimic events in the subgingival sulcus.The time points selected were based on evidence that innate immune responses occur within 6-8 h of bacterial colonization as well as on the sequence of bacterial colonization described by Diaz et al with initial colonization beginning at 2 h and a climax community at 8 h.Also preliminary studies revealed greater than 25 loss of viability of eukaryotic cells following a 12-h pathogen challenge or 24-h smoke exposure.
