This review aims to help the IBD clinician understand appreciate and eventually incorporate this coming paradigm shift to improve the care of children with IBD.Key Words Crohn disease genome microbiome ulcerative colitis whole exome sequencingJPGN 201866 374-377nflammatory bowel disease IBD is impacted by each individ- ual's genome as well as by environmental factors including food and the microbiome and their influence on the development and regulation of the mucosal immune system.

The first forays into a large-scale understanding of the molecular biology of IBD culminated in the ground-breaking GWAS of patients with IBD that linked 163 locations in the genome to the disease These early studies provided the identification of NOD2 a gene of proven importance in the pathophysiology of Crohn disease.Molecular studies that formerly were performed on individ- ual genes to decipher their identity are now readily and routinely performed on thousands of genes at the same time.

The reciprocal interactions between the collection of intestinal bacteria viruses and fungi and the intestinal immune system have been emerging as pivotal factors in the pathogenesis of IBD The complexity of the microbial diversity and of the development of the immune system requires a systems biology approach to make insights Environmental agents can also modify the host genome and impact its function and this is referred to as the epigenome.MicrobiomeTo distinguish the pathogenic role of microbial influences in IBD it is imperative to first survey the microbial architecture within normal and abnormal intestine.

Differences in DNA meth- ylation patterns have been detected in IBD and future studies will likely need to incorporate multiple omic profiles to fully capture the role of epigenetics.CONCLUSIONSWe are rapidly approaching an understanding of IBD as a set of molecular diseases.
