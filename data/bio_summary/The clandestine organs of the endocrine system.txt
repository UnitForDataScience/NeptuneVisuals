An earlier report of a polymorphism a SNP in a puta- tive estrogen response element in the gene coding for the PAC1 receptor predicted PTSD diagnosis and symptoms only in females .Taken together all this information just begins to unravel the complex network of physiological genetic epigenetic and other mechanisms governing stress responses and reveals exciting areas of research that would further improve our understanding of stress.The immune systemThere is a clear interaction between the neuro endocrine and the immune system  even in highlydivergent and evolutionary distant models such as molluscs crus- taceans insects and mammals  .

For an in depth review of the immunomodulatory actions of the HPG axis hormones see .Just like the endocrine system can regulate the immune system the immune system also regulates the endocrine system.

Other immune system molecules such as thymicpeptides affect the HPG axis by stimulating GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus and gonadotropin from the pituitary of female rats .Stress certainly affects the immune system as well.

Gioacchini and colleagues showed that a probiotic mix acti- vated the endocannabinoid system in zebrafish highlighting its potential to regulate immune cell function and providing clear evi- dence of the involvement of microbiota changes on the zebrafish immune system .Fig.

As it has been also shown that children growing with dogs have lower rates of asthma researchers believe that there is a link between gut micro- biota development and allergic disease probably due to exposure to larger diversity of microbes such as those on dog fur  .While the study of the linkages between microbiome with the endocrine neuroendocrine and immune systems and stress response is a relatively new field of study it is clear that the effects are mutual and significant opening plenty of opportunities for fur- ther research leading to a better understanding of the very com- plex system connections.ConclusionsThe systems biology paradigm that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts a holistic approach to deciphering the com- plexity of biological systems that starts from understanding the networks that form the whole of a living organism summarizes the concept described in this review that the endocrine neuroen- docrine immune and stress response system and the microbiome are just highly interconnected parts of the whole system and that one cannot be completely understood without the other.

The immune system is very closely related to the endocrine system with many intertwined processes and signals.

It has been long accepted that there is a bidirectional communica- tion between the endocrine and the immune system.

Hormones and neuropeptides have been shown to influence the immune sys- tem in healthy and diseased individuals and cells within the ner- vous and endocrine system contain receptors for cytokines and growth factors reviewed in .

During times of stress communication between the immune neuroendocrine and endo- crine system is vital for overcoming the stress and maintaining homestasis.
