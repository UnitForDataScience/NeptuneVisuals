in addition to food adsorbed by intestinal surface bacterial products such as bacterial DNa peptidoglycans molecules belonging to the class of pathogen-associated molecular patterns PaMPs and in some cases intact bacteria can reach the liver in elevated quanti- ties in relation to intestinal permeability iP levels.3Even if in the last few years a huge increase in knowledge on the possible role of gut mi- crobiota in the development of liver disease has been observed a current status of opinion equability on pathogenetic mechanisms able to support the damage does not exist.

this is probably related to the various analysis meth- ods used in scientific trials for the study of in- testinal microbial composition as well as to the fact that in the last few years next-generation sequencing methods have been developed and the number of novel data sometimes difficult to understand has increased.4 However even if an important progress in the study of asso- ciation between specific taxa and diseases has been achieved thanks to metagenomics analy- ses a large number of key questions remains unanswered.In this review we analyzed the main litera- ture findings on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of liver damage in different types and stages of chronic liver disease and its role in the development of cirrhosis and he- patocellular carcinoma hcc.The gut microbiota in chronic liver diseasesIt is well known that the diet is one of the most important factors regulating intestinal mi- crobial composition.

this dysbiosis gradually disappears as a consequence of weight loss obtained by hypocaloric diet until its complete disappear- ance due to normal weight.7 Nowadays the use of information deriving from outcome of scientific trials is scarcely applicable in rou- tine clinical practice and a strong limitation in the management of gut microbiota for the treatment of liver pathologies is represented by the difficulty in modifying selectively the proportion of its microbial species without modifying the balance able to maintain the gut health.8to maintain gut microbiota health means to maintain a correct proportion that is different from one person to another among different bacterial species.

This allows defending meta- bolic structural and immune functions of eu- biotic microbiota thus becoming essential for the host life.9In fact together with the intestinal mucosa the endogenous intestinal flora forms an im- portant barrier against pathogens by the mech-anism of metabolic competition that impedes the overgrowth of pathogenic species and the development of leaky gut syndrome.10Intestinal bacterial overgrowth is com- mon in patients with alcoholic liver disease alD.
