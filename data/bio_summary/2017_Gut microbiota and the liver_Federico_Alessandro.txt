this dysbiosis gradually disappears as a consequence of weight loss obtained by hypocaloric diet until its complete disappear- ance due to normal weight.7 nowadays the use of information deriving from outcome of scientific trials is scarcely applicable in rou- tine clinical practice and a strong limitation in the management of gut microbiota for the treatment of liver pathologies is represented by the difficulty in modifying selectively the proportion of its microbial species without modifying the balance able to maintain the gut health.8to maintain gut microbiota health means to maintain a correct proportion that is different from one person to another among different bacterial species.

the results suggest that an immuno-tolerating pathway to hbv prevailed in young mice before the es- tablishment of gut bacteria through a tlr4- dependent pathway and that the maturation of gut microbiota in adult mice stimulated liver immunity resulting in rapid hbv clearance.28nafldthe role carried out by gut microbiota in the alteration of systemic metabolism is confirmed by a lot of studies on animals and humans in literature.29ip degree can be correlated to both the body mass and the presence or absence of liver ste- atosis.

the results of some studies that try to ascribe a role to gutmicrobiota in the development of hepato-bili- ary inflammation are unclear nevertheless an involvement of gut microbiota is evident.63liver fibrosis cirrhosis and hccliver inflammation dependent from gut microbiota caused by the connection between intestine and liver ensured by gut liver axis also underlies the progression of damage in more advanced stages of the pathology cir- rhosis and hcc.64 hsc activation related to pamps recognition by tlr underlies a proc- ess that induces their transformation in myofi- broblastic cells.

this is probably related to the various analysis meth- ods used in scientific trials for the study of in- testinal microbial composition as well as to the fact that in the last few years next-generation sequencing methods have been developed and the number of novel data sometimes difficult to understand has increased.4 however even if an important progress in the study of asso- ciation between specific taxa and diseases has been achieved thanks to metagenomics analy- ses a large number of key questions remains unanswered.in this review we analyzed the main litera- ture findings on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of liver damage in different types and stages of chronic liver disease and its role in the development of cirrhosis and he- patocellular carcinoma hcc.the gut microbiota in chronic liver diseasesit is well known that the diet is one of the most important factors regulating intestinal mi- crobial composition.

its increase in relation to a dysbi- otic gut can be considered a key point for the comprehension of some pathogenetic mecha- nisms of systemic and liver disorders.ip and liver damagein medicine a seemingly simple intuition can hide a complex network of pathological in- terconnections able to provide a scientific basis for pathological mechanism of several diseas- es including the interconnection between gut microbiota and systemic diseases mediated by ip increase.

moreover bacterial translocation leads to a systemic inflammatory response with subsequent in- crease in portal hypertension exacerbating the characteristic hyperdynamic circulation in these patients all negatively impacting liver function.24 there are also structural and func- tional changes in the intestinal barrier that may be secondary to vascular stasis resulting from portal hypertension and that can lead to increased ip to bacterial migration and their products.therefore the leaky gut syndrome repre- sents the primum movens for the involve- ment of gut microbiota in the development of different liver diseases.

the 51cr- ethylene diamine tetra acetate 51cr-edta test of ip and immunohistochemical analysis of zo-1 expression in duodenal biopsy speci- mens showed ip values directly proportional to steatosis degree by liver biopsy to the pres- ence of metabolic syndrome but not to the presence or not of non-alcoholic steatohepati- tis nash nafld activity score nas and fibrosis degree.31however a later study demonstrated thatan increase of ip evaluated by test with lactu- lose and mannitol correlated in nafld bi- opsy proven patients with the stage and type of disease non-alcoholic fatty liver nafl or nash nas liver fibrosis and a higher lev- els of bacterial serum lps in nash patients in comparison to simple steatosis.32the concept of gut bacterial richness is strictly interconnected to gut microbiota eubi- osis.

gut microbiota represents the highest endogenous source of ethanol.43 ethanol concentration decreases after neomycin use therefore the elevated ethanolemia probably derives from a direct production by gut microbiota.44 esch- erichia coli 1 g wet weight produces 0.8 g of ethanol in 1 hour.

highlighted the ex- istence of a gut-brain axis in alcohol depen- dence which implicates the gut microbiota as an actor in the gut barrier and in behavioral disorders.

this fact confirms the fundamental role carried out by gut mi- crobiota in determining one of the pathologies with the greatest health and social impact in the last years and in the near future the nafld.for these reasons gut microbiota could be considered as the new system of human body.

mi- crobiota in patients affected by psc is poor in genes therefore it has a lack of gut bacte- rial richness as demonstrated by rossen et al.
