Bacterial DNA composition in the plaques was determined by performing 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes and total bacterial load was determined by qPCR.Results We confirmed the presence of bacterial DNA in the atherosclerotic plaque by qPCR analysis of the 16S rRNA gene but observed no difference n.s.

There was no difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients or plaque regions when analyzing the origin of DNA at phylum family or OTU level n.s..Conclusions There were no major differences in bacterial DNA amount or microbial composition be- tween plaques from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients or between different plaque regions suggesting that other factors are more important in determining plaque vulnerability.c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The amount of bacterial plaque DNA was quantified by qPCR using 0.5 ng of DNA and 0.5 mM final concentration of primers FBact 1369 and RProk 1492 .

Six 25-mL PCR reactions were performed per sample using 0.2 mM forward and reverse primers 200 ng template DNA FastStart Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase and PCR nucleotide mix Roche.

The sections representing maximum stenosis were significantly more often of a histologically vulnerable phenotype 82 of 33 sections compared with upstream 18 of 33 sections and down-stream sections 53 of 30 sections p  0.05.Bacterial DNA in atherosclerotic plaquesWe used qPCR to determine the amount of bacterial DNA pre- sent in the atherosclerotic plaques.

Taken together the overall bacterial DNA profiles were similar in the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and across regions in the plaque.DiscussionIn this study we confirmed the presence of bacterial DNA in human plaque samples and found it to be dominated by Proteo- bacteria and Actinobacteria which is in agreement with previous findings .

To summarize the amount and type of bacterial DNA in plaques were comparable along the length of the plaque suggest- ing that a different bacterial DNA composition is not enough to explain changes in local plaque morphology.Although the microbiota within the plaque might not contribute largely to the histological vulnerability microbiota in other body sites has been associated with atherosclerotic disease.

Infectious agents can act both directly byinfecting the vascular cells leading to activation of the immune system and indirectly through infection at a distant site thus inducing a systemic inflammatory response e. Thus a broad variety of bacterial DNA has indeed been found in atherosclerotic plaques  and some of the phylotypes were common to the oral cavity or gut .
