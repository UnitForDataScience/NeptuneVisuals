there was no difference in the amount of bacterial dna between the asymptomatic and symp- tomatic plaque samples b. as plaque morphology alters along the longitudinal section of the plaque in parallel with the risk of rupture  the amount of bacterial dna was also analyzed in three separate plaque regions a upstream of maximum steno- sis b maximum stenosis in proximity to bifurcation and c downstream of bifurcation in internal carotid artery a. there was no difference in the amount of bacterial dna between the different plaque regions c nor was there a difference be- tween patient groups when the regions were separated supplementary fig.

bacterial dna composition in the plaques was determined by performing 454 pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna genes and total bacterial load was determined by qpcr.results we confirmed the presence of bacterial dna in the atherosclerotic plaque by qpcr analysis of the 16s rrna gene but observed no difference n.s.

taken together the overall bacterial dna profiles were similar in the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and across regions in the plaque.discussionin this study we confirmed the presence of bacterial dna in human plaque samples and found it to be dominated by proteo- bacteria and actinobacteria which is in agreement with previous findings .

to summarize the amount and type of bacterial dna in plaques were comparable along the length of the plaque suggest- ing that a different bacterial dna composition is not enough to explain changes in local plaque morphology.although the microbiota within the plaque might not contribute largely to the histological vulnerability microbiota in other body sites has been associated with atherosclerotic disease.

operational taxonomic units otus from 5 different phyla were identified with the majority of the otus belonging to proteobacteria 48.3 and actinobacteria 40.2. there was no difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients or plaque regions when analyzing the origin of dna at phylum family or otu level n.s..conclusions there were no major differences in bacterial dna amount or microbial composition be- tween plaques from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients or between different plaque regions suggesting that other factors are more important in determining plaque vulnerability.c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.introductioncardiovascular disease mainly caused by atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death worldwide .

the amount of bacterial plaque dna was quantified by qpcr using 0.5 ng of dna and 0.5 mm final concentration of primers fbact 1369 and rprok 1492 .

the main event in the symptomatic patient group was stroke 82 and the remain- ing patients had either a transitory ischemic attack tia or amaurosis fugax afx 18. there was no difference in blood pressure medical treatment or cholesterol levels between the asymptomatic and the symptomatic patients n.s..plaque morphologythere was a non-significant trend towards increased frequency of vulnerable plaque sections in patients reporting symptoms of cerebral ischemia stroke tia afx 57 of 65 sections compared with asymptomatic patients 39 of 31 sections p 0.13. the sections representing maximum stenosis were significantly more often of a histologically vulnerable phenotype 82 of 33 sections compared with upstream 18 of 33 sections and down-stream sections 53 of 30 sections p  0.05.bacterial dna in atherosclerotic plaqueswe used qpcr to determine the amount of bacterial dna pre- sent in the atherosclerotic plaques.

we did not observe increased amount of bacterial dna or different bacterial taxa to be present in patients with symp- tomatic compared with asymptomatic plaques neither did we observe differences in microbial composition within the plaque.

however it is still unclear whether a specific bacterial profile in the atherosclerotic plaque is associated with the severity of atherosclerosis or influences plaque stability.high throughput sequencing and pcr techniques have made it possible to quantitatively determine the abundance of different classes of bacteria in high abundance samples like feces but also in samples containing only small amounts of bacterial dna for example atherosclerotic plaques .

infectious agents can act both directly byinfecting the vascular cells leading to activation of the immune system and indirectly through infection at a distant site thus inducing a systemic inflammatory response e. thus a broad variety of bacterial dna has indeed been found in atherosclerotic plaques  and some of the phylotypes were common to the oral cavity or gut .

bacterial dna in tissues and blood has been corresponding author.

in this study using pyrose- quencing of 16s rrna genes we characterized the bacterial dna present in atherosclerotic plaques of symptomatic and asymp- tomatic patients.hemodynamics of blood flow influence the development of plaque tissue and consequently the morphology of the athero- sclerotic plaque differ along the longitudinal axis probably affecting the vulnerability and risk for rupture .

the overall aim of this study was to determine the amount of bacterial dna and the microbial composition in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque and investigate whether carotid plaque samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were associated with specific bacteria in the plaque.materials and methodsatherosclerotic plaque samplesthe plaque samples were obtained from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at norrland's university hospital in umea sweden.
