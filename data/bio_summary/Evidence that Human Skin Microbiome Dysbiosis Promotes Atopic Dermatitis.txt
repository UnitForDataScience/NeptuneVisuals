Collectively these and several other reports provide strong supporting mechanistic evidence that can explain how S. aureus colonization could promote AD in genetically susceptible individuals.Current therapeutic strategies to combat S. aureusThe etiologic role of S. aureus in AD suggested by the work discussed suggests that targeted elimination of S. aureus should be beneficial.

Although in vitro studies of the effect of S. aureus on skin cells is important mechanistically in vivo murine models of live S. aureus colonization have provided even stronger evidence that S. aureus colonization can induce AD skin phenotypes.

Indeed recent work has shown that not only is S. aureus increased on AD skin but that specific strains of S. aureus are associated with more severe AD Byrd et al.

aureus colonization in longitudinal studiesAlthough multiple clinical studies had previously shown increased S. aureus colonization in children and adult patients with existing AD it remains unclear if S. aureus precedes the onset of clinically apparent disease.

Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene DNA sequencing the researchers did not detect significant increases in S. aureus colonization on the 10 infants who developed AD and they therefore concluded that S. aureus colonizes skin after onset of AD.

2017.Recent experimental evidence that S. aureus can induce AD-like phenotypesExperiments done in vitro and in mice suggest that S. aureus could promote disease through secretion of multiple virulence factors.

The presence of these coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains was strongly associated with protection against S. aureus in the normal population and when an expanded culture of these beneficial bacteria was applied to the skin of AD subjects this significantly reduced S. aureus colonization.

If S. aureus is present then the subject tends to have more severe disease.

However it is unclear if S. aureus is a cause of atopic dermatitis or a consequence of the abnormal epithelial environment.

present evidence from a prospective clinical trial that shows that S. aureus colonization precedes onset of atopic dermatitis in children.
