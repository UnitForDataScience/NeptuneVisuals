Likewise use of ethyl acetate extracts of the agar plates from the colony proximity studies B  section did not result in observable zones of inhibition on B. atrophaeus lawns data not shown.Colony Growth in ProximityApproximately 3 days after spotting each species in proximity on a 10 gL TSB plate B. atrophaeus colonies were observed growing away from P. putida colonies while the P. putida colonies appeared to advance toward the B. atrophaeus colo- nies Fig.

B. atrophaeus growing in 50 vv filter-sterilized supernatant from stationary B. atrophaeus cul- tures entered exponential growth phase slightly before cul- tures of B. atrophaeus growing in 50 filter-sterilized super- natant from pure P. putida or co-culture SI Fig.

Inoculation volumes were 200 mL of 110 dilution of B. atrophaeus pre- culture and 100 mL of 11000 dilution of P. putida pre-culture delivering approximately 5-fold greater B. atrophaeus CFUs than CFUs for P. putida.

In contrast little change was observed in the motility of B. atrophaeus during growth with P. putida on a plate though B. atrophaeus actively grew away from advanc- ing P. putida similar to the recently reported response ofB.

For both m and DCW statistical differences between culture types were determinedby a two-tailed Student's t test across biological replicates assuming equal variances.Supernatant Growth ExperimentsSince proteomics results suggested antagonism by P. putida toward B. atrophaeus it was hypothesized that compounds secreted into the culture medium by P. putida would have an inhibitory effect on B. atrophaeus growth.

Co-culture on agar plates triggered a filamentous phenotype in P. putida and avoidance of P. putida by B. atrophaeus colonies corroborating antagonistic interac- tions between these species.

For each biological condition pure B. atrophaeus pure P. putida co-culture triplicate flasks containing 200 mL of 10 gL TSB were inoculated with a volume of pre-culture previously de- termined by Gram staining and plate counts to result in ap- proximately equal concentrations CFUmL of each species in the co-culture after 20 h of growth.

licheniformis as an antimicrobial  suggesting secretion of a similar compound by B. atrophaeus a Bacillus species closely related to B. licheniformis .Several P. putida proteins more abundant in the co-culture were responsible for phenazine biosynthesis including PhzF the critical protein for phenazine production .

Future work could identify the particular form of swarming motility in- duced in P. putida by the presence of B. atrophaeus during surface-associated growth and investigate how this phenotype could be involved in interactions between the species in plank- tonic culture.Metal Binding as Competitive StrategyCompetitive interactions between species under limiting con- ditions of certain metals are well documented -.

This sug- gests that co-culturing stimulated P. putida metabolism at the expense of B. atrophaeus metabolism an interpretation cor- roborated by a decrease in abundance of many B. atrophaeus proteins associated with glycolysis and the TCA cycle as well as with the phosphotransferase system of sugar uptake SI Table S3.
