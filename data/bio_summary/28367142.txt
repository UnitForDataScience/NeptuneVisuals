the coincidence of a sharp peak in h2 emission and a relatively weak increase in ch4 emission followed by a steeper decline in h2 emission compared with ch4 emission after the peak emission is in line with olijhoek et al.

rumen methanogenic archaea do not directly utilize feed but only fermentation products such as h2 which explains why the peak in emission of ch4 appeared after the peak in h2 emission 0.8 vs. 0.5 h. the less steep decline of ch4 emission after its peak compared to h2 emission suggests that the archaeal enzymes are saturated with h2 producing ch4 still close to their maximum rate.

significance of effects was declared at p  0.05 and tendencies to significance at 0.05  p  0.10.gaseous emissionstranslocation of cows to chambers may affect the gas emission profile of that particular day and therefore only data obtained between morning feedings on day 14 and 17 were evaluated.since cows were fed at 10 and 14 h intervals every day values of h2 and ch4 emission observed between morning and evening feeding and evening and morning feeding were fitted to time separately.

average daytime ch4 emission rates were 1.12 and 1.07 molh and average overnight ch4 emission rates 1.05 and 1.02 molh for con and lso diets respectively.the hyperbolic model fitted best to the log10 transformed h2 emission rate on aic table s4.

the ratio of archaea to bacteria varied from 0.11 to0.22 figure 3b and tended to be affected by time from feeding p  0.089 with no significant differences between time points p  0.138. neither a diet effect p  0.611 nor a time x diet interaction was observed p  0.934 for the archaea to bacteria ratio.hydrogen and methane emissionaverage emission rates of h2 during daytime which was from morning feeding at 6 a.m. to afternoon feeding at 4 p.m. were33.0 and 34.3 mmolh for con and lso fed cows respectively table s3.

2016 observed the lowest average dairy cow h2 emission of 6 mmolh over the hour before feeding and the highest average h2 emission of 134 mmolh over the first hour after feeding for their control diet.

2015 who reported the highest average hourly emission from dairy cows in the second hour after feeding whereas the highest average hourly emission was observed in the third hour after feeding by olijhoek et al.

many of the genus-level phylogenetic groupings also differed further in terms of the time points where their relative abundance was highest figure 6. the nine genus-level phylogenetic groupings for the high time point category had high relative abundances at the following times after feeding pseudobutyrivibrio 0.5-1.5 h lactobacillus 1-2 h selenomonas 1.5 h succiniclasticum 1.5 h erysipelotrichaceaethe following times after feeding cyanobacteria sha-109ofg- na 0-0.5 h aeromonadalesfg-na 8 h ruminobacter 8h succinivibrio 8 h succinivibrionaceaeg-na 8-10 and 0 h and rumincoccaceae incertae sedis 10 and 0 h. of the variation in the relative abundance of genus-level phylogenetic groupings that were best explained by diet only two groupings appeared to have high relative abundance associated with one of the diets figure 7. the bacteroidales bs11 gut group and the rikenellaceae rc9 gut group had a positive association with con and were therefore negatively associated with the lso.discussionincertae sedis 1.5 h streptococcus 1.5 h prevotella 1.5 h prevotellaceaeg-na 1.5-3 h and lentisphaeria rfp12 gut group 4 h. the six genus-level phylogenetic groupings for the low time point category had high relative abundances atto our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study that has identified the diurnal profiles of gaseous and dissolved metabolites including lactate and ethanol and the microbiota composition in the rumen along with associated respiration chamber measured h2 and ch4 emission rates.

on aic best-fit models for ch4 emission resulted in parameters that were significantly affected by diet indicating decreased ch4 emission from lso fed cows.

for daytime ch4 emission b2 was affected by diet difference con - lso 0.08 - 0.04 table s4 whereas for overnight ch4 emission rate b4 was affected by diet difference con - lso 0.02 - 0.01.microbial compositionbacteria 80.8 - 7.8 of the 16s rrna sequences were represented by 787 otu whereas the archaea 18.6 - 7.7 of the 16s rrna sequences were represented by 68 otu.

archaea in turn use the h2 and co2 released from fermentation to produce ch4 which is reflected in the peak in ch4 emission rate that follows the peak in h2 emission rate at 0.8 and 0.5 h respectively.

given the ch4 emission rate and dmi the ch4 yield in the present study is 22.6 gkg of dm which is comparable to the ch4 yields for dairy and beef cattle reported by veneman et al.

on day 11 of each period60 ml of rumen gas was sampled and feed left in the feeding bins was weighed at set time intervals 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 h after feeding and 60 ml of rumen fluid was also sampled 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 3 4 6 8 and 10 h after feeding.

the bacterial decline from 3 to 4 h is likely to be associated with decreased metabolic activity as evidenced by the significant decrease in total vfa concentration also from 3 to 4 h after feeding figure 2. since the bacterial concentration did not consistently increase until 2 h after feeding whereas the total vfa concentration did other processes may have been counteracting an increase in the bacterial concentration in the rumen fluid such as adherence of bacteria to feed particles.archaeal concentration followed a similar pattern to the bacterial concentration except no increase was observed at 0.5 h after feeding.
