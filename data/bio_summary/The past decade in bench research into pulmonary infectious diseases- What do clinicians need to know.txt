Cross infection of epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa in CF has been known for some time and is the basis of the recommendations for strict infection control procedures in CF.2930 Recently WGS has been used for the first time to demonstrate the transmission of Mycobacterium abscessus in CF a finding with major infection con- trol implications.3132Initially a single-centre study from Cambridgeexamined 31 patients from 2007 to 2011 and using WGS showed near-identical M. abscessus subspecies massiliense isolates in 11 patients.31 WGS cannot clearly demonstrate whether individuals have acquired an identical organism from each other or from a common environmental source but by trac- ing back through patients medical history the authors were able to demonstrate opportunities for cross infection through shared environment for example sharing the same room.31 Mycobacterium abscessus appeared able to be transmitted despite standard infection control procedures.

R- roscovitine was shown to induce neutrophil apoptosis and aid the resolution of inflammation in models of lung inflammation.75 Hypoxia a defining feature of most inflammatory lung conditions promotes pro- longed neutrophil survival through upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF.7677 Studies in mice humans and zebrafish have demonstrated that interfer- ing in hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF can sup- port resolution of neutrophilic inflammation in the lung providing a potential novel therapy for a range of infectious lung diseases.7677Neutrophils clear pathogens through intracellular killing by phagocytosis or extracellularly through degranulation.
