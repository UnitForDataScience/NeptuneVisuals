R- roscovitine was shown to induce neutrophil apoptosis and aid the resolution of inflammation in models of lung inflammation.75 Hypoxia a defining feature of most inflammatory lung conditions promotes pro- longed neutrophil survival through upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF.7677 Studies in mice humans and zebrafish have demonstrated that interfer- ing in hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF can sup- port resolution of neutrophilic inflammation in the lung providing a potential novel therapy for a range of infectious lung diseases.7677Neutrophils clear pathogens through intracellular killing by phagocytosis or extracellularly through degranulation.

She is inter- ested in the interactions between the lung microbiota and immune responses in chronic lung disease patients and how this can be operationalized to improve patient stratification and personalized medicine.

For example whole- genome sequencing WGS of P. aeruginosa from cys- tic fibrosis CF and bronchiectasis patients reveals how this key pathogen adapts to the airway.1112 In a study of 189 isolates from bronchiectasis patients Hil- liam et al.

Cross infection of epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa in CF has been known for some time and is the basis of the recommendations for strict infection control procedures in CF.2930 Recently WGS has been used for the first time to demonstrate the transmission of Mycobacterium abscessus in CF a finding with major infection con- trol implications.3132Initially a single-centre study from Cambridgeexamined 31 patients from 2007 to 2011 and using WGS showed near-identical M. abscessus subspecies massiliense isolates in 11 patients.31 WGS cannot clearly demonstrate whether individuals have acquired an identical organism from each other or from a common environmental source but by trac- ing back through patients medical history the authors were able to demonstrate opportunities for cross infection through shared environment for example sharing the same room.31 Mycobacterium abscessus appeared able to be transmitted despite standard infection control procedures.

In line with this analysis of a randomized con- trolled trial of erythromycin in bronchiectasis showed that while patients with P. aeruginosa infection appeared to respond most to the treatment giving the drug to less severely ill patients with Haemophilus spp.

performed genome-wide gene expression profiling on blood from111 patients with HAP and 110 patients with CAP admitted to the intensive care unit ICU.62 Their analy- sis showed that these severe infections altered the expression of thousands of genes with pathways affected including the proinflammatory IL-1 and IL-8 signalling pathways endocytosis signalling and a reduced expression of lymphocyte signalling pathways.

Microbiota technology has also uncovered unex- pected roles for lung bacteria in the pathophysiology of 'non-infectious' disorders such as idiopathicpulmonary fibrosis although the exact significance of these findings and the apparent response of some patients to co-trimoxazole therapy remains to be established.60Direct implementation of the technology into clinical practice may be limited as with WGS by the time required to prepare samples and perform bioinformat- ics analysis.

Upregulation of S100A8 and S100A9 has also been observed in other lung diseases associated with neutro- philic inflammation which is directly linked to chronic bacterial infection illustrating how a proteomic bio- marker can help to classify patients into inflammatory subgroups.65 The application of proteomics to inflam- matory airway diseases other than CF is currently quite limited but has significant potential.LipidomicsAs proteomics looks for proteins lipidomics seeks to identify lipid mediators which may be similarly associ- ated with disease.

propose 'anadapted island model of lung biogeography' in which pneumonia development is the result of complex inter- play between the ingress of bacteria predominantly from the upper respiratory tract and the clearance of bacteria by immune and mucociliary mechanisms.48 The importance of 'communication' between the high biomass of the gastrointestinal tract and the lung is slowly being established.

Identification of bacteria that have been killed by antibiotics because DNA persists following loss of bacterial viability.Allows an understanding of how interventions such asantibiotics or immunomodulatory therapies affect the whole microbiota rather than just individual organisms.The balancediversity of the microbiota and the domi-nance of individual species appear to give prognostic information in chronic lung diseases.THE OMICS REVOLUTION IN UNDERSTANDING HOST RESPONSEInflammatory and infectious lung diseases are highly complex and highly diverse in terms of their host response.
