While upperrespiratory tract microbial populations have been described there are currently no published studies describing the normal microbial populations of the bovine lower respiratory tract.

While useful this approach is unable to provide information on those organisms that cannot be easily cultured but are likely present at these sites and so only provides a narrow understanding of the complexity of these clinically important microbial ecosys- tems Advances in next generation sequencing and bioinformatics have facilitated the characterization of the composition and diversity of complex microbial popula- tions at mucosal sites and have provided remarkable insight into the interaction of these populations with the host .

These findings are important because of the central role played by the upper respiratory microbial communities in defense against potential patho- gen access and colonization of the lung and lower airways   and because the terminal airways and adjoining alveoli are the primary site of pathogen colonization and pathology in respiratory infections.The calves in this study all originated from the same cow-calf enterprise and had been exposed to similar management and environmental challenges and so the pattern of nasopharyngeal microbial communities was anticipated to be relatively consistent across individuals.

While the composition and development of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in feedlot cattle has been recently described    there are no published studies describing lower respiratory tract microbial com- munities in feedlot cattle.

Technical ad- vances in culture-independent techniques have shown that the respiratory tract of healthy people is not sterilebut is composed of a complex and previously unappreci- ated microbial community   and that certain con- figurations of the microbiota may be associated with development of respiratory disease .

There was no statistically significant difference in different bacterial diversity indices between the upper and lower respiratory tract P value 0.05independent techniques for the identification of organ- isms with fastidious growth requirements While there was some overlap between the upper and lower respiratory tract microbial communities there was strong evidence for a distinct bronchoalveolar microbiota.

It has been shown that the healthy human lung does not harbor consistent and distinct microbial communities but instead possesses a variable microbiota that is highly correlated and largely indistinguishable from that of the upper respiratory tract .

In this population of animals the core microbiota was composed of organisms from the Mycoplasma Clostridium Streptococcus Moraxella and Alkaliphilus taxa.DiscussionIn this study we describe the first use of high throughput sequencing in comparing the upper and lower respiratory microbiota of feedlot cattle.
