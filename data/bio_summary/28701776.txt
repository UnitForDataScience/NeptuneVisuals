in particular by using a recombinant system that contained selected components of the shell the authors generated a complete 40 nm shell witha molecular mass of 6.5 mda and determined its structure to a resolution of 3.5 a. considering that these structures are widely conserved in bacteria these findings probably apply to various functionally distinct bacterial organelles.original article sutter m. et al.
