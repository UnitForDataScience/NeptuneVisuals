Different lowercase letters a b c indicate significant differences between groups at the indicated days following C. jejuni inoculation P  0.05.In addition we also detected higher numbers of goblet cells score 4 in the cecum of GF birds following C. jejuni inoculation and  but to a lesser extent in SPF birds score 2 than in the cecum of C. jejuni-free birds score 1 and .Effect of antibiotic treatment on gut microbiota composition of commercial broilers after C. jejuni inoculation.

The effect of antibiotic treatment was of a greater consequence than C. jejuni colonization but there was also a cumulative effect of the treatment and C. jejuni .DISCUSSIONThe intestinal microbiota has been considered one of the key factors influencing the host response and outcome of C. jejuni colonization   .

Overall C. jejuni colonization rates of other tissues including spleen and liver as well as ileum were higher in AT and GF birds after C. jejuni colonization than in the respective control groups .C.

All birds were tested and shown to be negative for C. jejuni by cloacal swabs at the day of C. jejuni inoculation.

Significantly higher numbers of CFU of C. jejuni were detected in the cecal contents of AT and GF birds with higher colonization rates in spleen liver and ileum than in birds with a con- ventional gut microbiota P  0.05.
