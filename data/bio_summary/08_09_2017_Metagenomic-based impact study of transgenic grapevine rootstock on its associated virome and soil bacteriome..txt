2013. the variation of p along the gflv genome was evaluated by sliding window analyses using dnasp v.5.10 librado and rozas 2009. the difference between non- synonymous dn and synonymous ds substitutions over the coding sequences from gflv populations was estimated by the pamilo-bianchi-li method as implemented in mega6.

sequences were used assingleton and the 12 data sets were then trimmed table s6 with clc genomics workbench 8.5.1 clc bio genomics qiagen aarhus denmark and mapped against reference sequences see ngs data analysis section.phylogenetic microarraysthe 16s rrna genes of soil dna were amplified using the primers pa and t7-ph.

our system is therefore an excellent model for addressing hgt in a perennial crop by comparing the structure and genetic diversity of gflv populations as well as rhizosphere bacterial populations using metagenomics approaches.resultsno transgene-derived sequences were detected in rhizospheric soil bacterial populationsto investigate hgt between gm plants and bacterial populations in the rhizospheric soil antibiotic resistance in soil bacteria sampled from gm expressing f13-cp and nptii vigne et al.

identical results were obtained with rnaseq of leaf samples from gm grapevines validating the fact that plant t0 transformants and soil samples did not contain at detectable levels the recombinant bacterial strain used for transformation.no transgene-derived sequences translocation to scion or to viral population was observedgm and wt rootstocks were exposed to a natural gflv infection.

these observations also suggest that no replication or movement-competent gflv recombinant containing transgene-derived sequences emerged in the trans- genic grapevine rootstocks with subsequent translocation into the scion.

as expected eukaryotic sequences were much more abundant in leaf than in soil samples figure s2c.no evidence of undesired impact of transgenic expression on viromea comprehensive virological evaluation was performed and the molecular diversity of the three gflv rnas genomic rnas 1 2 and satellite was assessed for each plant tested.

from the rnaseq data set seventy complete gflv rna1 sequences genbank accessions and were obtained.

sim- ilarly 31 full-length sequences of gflv satrna were obtained genbank accessions while all sequencesclustered together clade i figure s3a compared to the known satellite diversity cepin et al.

remarkably this difference in cp structuration was only due to the clade i missing from gmr class as removal of clade i sequences from the data set abolished the genetic differentia- tion between populations figure s4b fst  -0.020 p  0.474. these results were confirmed by performing the same analyses on the ic-rt-pcr data set figures s3c and s4c and table s4.figure 3 phylogenetic relationships of gflv rna1 and rna2 genomes obtained from leaf samples from gm rootstock gmr in blue non-gm rootstock wtr in red scion grafted onto gmr scgm in yellow and scion grafted onto wtr scwt in green samples assembled with clc workbench 8.5.1 software.
