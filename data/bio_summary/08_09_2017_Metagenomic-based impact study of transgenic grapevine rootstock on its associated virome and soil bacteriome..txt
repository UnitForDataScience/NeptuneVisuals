Our system is therefore an excellent model for addressing HGT in a perennial crop by comparing the structure and genetic diversity of GFLV populations as well as rhizosphere bacterial populations using metagenomics approaches.ResultsNo transgene-derived sequences were detected in rhizospheric soil bacterial populationsTo investigate HGT between GM plants and bacterial populations in the rhizospheric soil antibiotic resistance in soil bacteria sampled from GM expressing F13-cp and nptII Vigne et al.

Identical results were obtained with RNAseq of leaf samples from GM grapevines validating the fact that plant T0 transformants and soil samples did not contain at detectable levels the recombinant bacterial strain used for transformation.No transgene-derived sequences translocation to scion or to viral population was observedGM and WT rootstocks were exposed to a natural GFLV infection.

These observations also suggest that no replication or movement-competent GFLV recombinant containing transgene-derived sequences emerged in the trans- genic grapevine rootstocks with subsequent translocation into the scion.

As expected eukaryotic sequences were much more abundant in leaf than in soil samples Figure S2c.No evidence of undesired impact of transgenic expression on viromeA comprehensive virological evaluation was performed and the molecular diversity of the three GFLV RNAs genomic RNAs 1 2 and satellite was assessed for each plant tested.
