Viral infections have become a potential threat to the health of these endangered animals but limited information related to these infections is available.Methods Using a viral metagenomic approach we surveyed viruses in the feces nasopharyngeal secretions blood and different tissues from a wild giant panda that died from an unknown disease a healthy wild giant panda and 46 healthy captive animals.Results The previously uncharacterized complete or near complete genomes of four viruses from three genera in Papillomaviridae family six viruses in a proposed new Picornaviridae genus Aimelvirus two unclassified viruses related to posaviruses in Picornavirales order 19 anelloviruses in four different clades of Anelloviridae family four putative circoviruses and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described Genomoviridae family were sequenced.

The insect virus se- quences shared amino acid sequence identity of 25-90 with annotated insect viral proteins.Large numbers of plant virus sequences were de- tected in each fecal library but none in respiratory swabs plasma or tissues Table RNA viruses were predominant with 80 of plant viral reads the ma- jority being related to single-stranded RNA viruses in the family Tombusviridae followed by the families Partitiviridae Secoviridae Geminiviridae Luteoviridae Virgaviridae and Rhabdoviridae genus Umbravirus and family Alphaflexiviridae.

The raw sequence reads numbers of each library generated by the Illumina MiSeq are shown in Table Raw sequence reads were binned by barcodes and quality-filtered leaving high- quality sequence reads which were de novo assembled within each barcode.

The nasopharyngeal secre- tion sample of the sick wild giant panda contained abun- dant papillomavirus sequence reads whose sequence percentage 7.07 was higher than those of the onlytwo of ten nasopharyngeal secretions from healthy captive animals that were positive for papillomavirus with sequence percentages of 0.07 and 0.3 respect- ively Fig.

The similar viral families detected in sick and healthy giant pandas indicate that these viruses result in commensal infections in most immuno-competent animals.Keywords Giant panda Viral metagenomics Virome Papillomavirus Picornavirus Anellovirus Gemycircularvirus Putative circovirus Correspondence Equal contributors2Sichuan Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology for Endangered Wildlife Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding Chengdu Sichuan 610081 China7Sichuan Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology for Endangered WildlifeChengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding Chengdu Sichuan 610000 ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec The Authors.

The genome coverage of the target viruses were analyzed by Geneious Biomatters.PCR confirmation and genome sequencingPCR confirmation was performed for the papillomavirus gemycircularvirus adenovirus and insect viruses in the nasopharyngeal secretion samples picornavirus gyrovirus and circoviruses in the fecal samples gemycircularvirus in the blood samples and anellovirus and the insect virus Sacbrood virus in the tissues.

Comparison of the eukaryotic viruses in different giant pandas The composition of eukaryotic viruses of feces from the sick wild giant panda the healthy wild giant panda and three individually sequenced healthy captive giant pandas 25FNC 26FNC and 27FNC is shown Fig.

The nasopharyngeal swab of the diseased animal contained three mammalian viruses two types of papillomavirus anellovirus and adenovirus higher than those of the healthy captive giant pandas with an average of 0.9 distinct mammalian viruses per animal with co-infection ranging from 0 to 3.

The possible origin of posaviruses from pigs from aquatic algae has also been postulated based on their similarity to members of the algae infecting Marnaviridae and detection in water from wells on pig farms Only one fecal sample from the 25 captive giant pandas was positive for pansaviruspossibly reflecting the different environment in a breeding center relative to the wild.In recent years many genomes of rep-containing circu- lar DNA viruses in the Circoviridae and Genomoviridae have been characterized in mammals birds insects fungi and environmental samples bringing to light a high level of genetic diversity among these viruses .

Although multiple stu- dies of the bacterial content of giant panda feces have been reported - virologic study of giant panda has been limited to the identification and pathogenicity of single viruses including canine distemper virus canine parvovirus and influenza H1N1 -.Viral metagenomics has enabled the discovery of viral pathogens viruses of unknown pathogenicity and viruses of unknown cellular origins  In this method the concentration of host-derived and bacterial background nucleic acids in biological sam- ples is reduced by filtration and nuclease digestion while viral nucleic acids are protected within capsids.
