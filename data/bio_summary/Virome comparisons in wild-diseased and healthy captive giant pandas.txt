viral infections have become a potential threat to the health of these endangered animals but limited information related to these infections is available.methods using a viral metagenomic approach we surveyed viruses in the feces nasopharyngeal secretions blood and different tissues from a wild giant panda that died from an unknown disease a healthy wild giant panda and 46 healthy captive animals.results the previously uncharacterized complete or near complete genomes of four viruses from three genera in papillomaviridae family six viruses in a proposed new picornaviridae genus aimelvirus two unclassified viruses related to posaviruses in picornavirales order 19 anelloviruses in four different clades of anelloviridae family four putative circoviruses and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described genomoviridae family were sequenced.

although multiple stu- dies of the bacterial content of giant panda feces have been reported - virologic study of giant panda has been limited to the identification and pathogenicity of single viruses including canine distemper virus canine parvovirus and influenza h1n1 -.viral metagenomics has enabled the discovery of viral pathogens viruses of unknown pathogenicity and viruses of unknown cellular origins  in this method the concentration of host-derived and bacterial background nucleic acids in biological sam- ples is reduced by filtration and nuclease digestion while viral nucleic acids are protected within capsids.

the nasopharyngeal swab of the diseased animal contained three mammalian viruses two types of papillomavirus anellovirus and adenovirus higher than those of the healthy captive giant pandas with an average of 0.9 distinct mammalian viruses per animal with co-infection ranging from 0 to 3. the diseased animal was co-infected with at least 12 different anelloviruses a greater number than the average of seven distinct anellovirus per animal range 0-15.the picornavirus and papillomavirus stood out as two viruses whose sequence reads percentages were much higher than those of the healthy giant pandas.

although the viral families present in the sick giant panda were also detected in the healthy ones a higher proportion of papillomaviruses picornaviruses and anelloviruses reads were detected in the diseased panda.conclusion this viral survey increases our understanding of eukaryotic viruses in giant pandas and provides a baseline for comparison to viruses detected in future infectious disease outbreaks.

the genome coverage of the target viruses were analyzed by geneious biomatters.pcr confirmation and genome sequencingpcr confirmation was performed for the papillomavirus gemycircularvirus adenovirus and insect viruses in the nasopharyngeal secretion samples picornavirus gyrovirus and circoviruses in the fecal samples gemycircularvirus in the blood samples and anellovirus and the insect virus sacbrood virus in the tissues.

comparison of the eukaryotic viruses in different giant pandas the composition of eukaryotic viruses of feces from the sick wild giant panda the healthy wild giant panda and three individually sequenced healthy captive giant pandas 25fnc 26fnc and 27fnc is shown fig.

genomic organization is vari- able with a single polyprotein expressed in all orders except dicistroviridae where structural and non-structural protein genes are expressed from separate transcripts re- cently some highly divergent members of the picornavir- ales order have been discovered including porcine-stool- associated rna viruses posaviruses in the feces of pigs - fish-stool-associated rna virus fisavirus in the intestinal content of a healthy carp and human-stool- associated virus husavirus in the present study two large contigs 8703 and 8612 bp both encoding a 2778 aa polyprotein which showed sequence similarity to the polyprotein of posa- viruses were detected in the fecal samples from both wild giant pandas.

the insect virus se- quences shared amino acid sequence identity of 25-90 with annotated insect viral proteins.large numbers of plant virus sequences were de- tected in each fecal library but none in respiratory swabs plasma or tissues table rna viruses were predominant with 80 of plant viral reads the ma- jority being related to single-stranded rna viruses in the family tombusviridae followed by the families partitiviridae secoviridae geminiviridae luteoviridae virgaviridae and rhabdoviridae genus umbravirus and family alphaflexiviridae.

the possible origin of posaviruses from pigs from aquatic algae has also been postulated based on their similarity to members of the algae infecting marnaviridae and detection in water from wells on pig farms only one fecal sample from the 25 captive giant pandas was positive for pansaviruspossibly reflecting the different environment in a breeding center relative to the wild.in recent years many genomes of rep-containing circu- lar dna viruses in the circoviridae and genomoviridae have been characterized in mammals birds insects fungi and environmental samples bringing to light a high level of genetic diversity among these viruses .

it is increasingly clear that the presence of viruses is not necessarily indicative of pathogenesis and instead may represent a degree of commensal interactions between virus and host it is difficult to know how stably associated the virome is with the host as some viruses rely solely on a lytic life cycle and tend to produce short-lived acute infections.

comparison of the viruses in the healthy animals with those in future giant panda suffering sporadic or epidemic unexplained diseases of possible viral origins will help identify newly emerging possibly pathogenic viruses.

reflecting the diet of giant pandas numerous insect virus sequences related to the families iflaviridae dicistroviridae iridoviridae baculoviridae polydnaviridae and subfamily densovirinae and plant viruses sequences related to the families tombusviridae partitiviridae secoviridae geminiviridae luteoviridae virgaviridae and rhabdoviridae genus umbravirusalphaflexiviridae and phycodnaviridae were also detected in fecal samples.

the similar viral families detected in sick and healthy giant pandas indicate that these viruses result in commensal infections in most immuno-competent animals.keywords giant panda viral metagenomics virome papillomavirus picornavirus anellovirus gemycircularvirus putative circovirus correspondence equal contributors2sichuan key laboratory of conservation biology for endangered wildlife chengdu research base of giant panda breeding chengdu sichuan 610081 china7sichuan key laboratory of conservation biology for endangered wildlifechengdu research base of giant panda breeding chengdu sichuan 610000 chinafull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec the authors.

the resulting sequence contigs and singlets were compared with the viral reference database and the genbank non-redundant protein database using a blastx search with an e value cutoff of 10-5. trans- lated sequences similar to those of known or suspected eukaryotic viral proteins are summarized in table in the fecal samples we detected eukaryotic viral sequences related to picornaviridae genomoviridae circoviridae anelloviridae picobirnaviridae other unclassified virus in picornavirales and numerous insect and plant viruses.

a small number of insect viruses were also detected in the lung tissue.
