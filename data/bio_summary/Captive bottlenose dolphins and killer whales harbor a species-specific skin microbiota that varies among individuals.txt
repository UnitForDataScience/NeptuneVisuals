Therefore assessing the composition of skin microbiota of marine mammals could shed light on the importance of evolutionary legacies and adaptation to marine environment in shaping skin microbiota of animals.The only marine mammal skin microbiota described to date is the one of the free-ranging humpback whale from the North Pacific.

Animals housed in controlled environment offer the opportunity to measure the interspecific and inter-individual variability of ani- mals skin microbiota independently from environmental variability and to assess the intra-individual variability of their microbiota.Besides assessing the taxonomic and phylogenetic facets of skin microbiota describing its functional role is fundamental to understand the link between microbiota and host health.

at fin folding.Studies focusing on gut microbiota of insectsand terrestrial mammals-found a correlation between hosts phylogeny and microbiota and suggested that microbiota result from 'phylosymbiosis' partly due to co-speciation of hosts and microbes that are vertically transmitted.

In the case of skin-associated microbiota and more importantly in the case of those of animals living in seawater there is still no test if this microbiota is vertically or horizontally transmitted between individuals and if differences in skin microbiota are correlated to host's phylogeny.

We used high-throughput sequencing to assess the skin microbiota from 4 body zones of 8 bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and killer whales Orcinus orca housed in captivity Marineland park France.Overall cetacean skin microbiota is more diverse than planktonic communities and is dominated by different phylogenetic lineages and functions.

Apprill et al.showed that individuals share a core skin microbiota and that varia- bility in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of skin microbiota among individuals is driven by geographical location and the health state of the whale.

The skin microbiota of dolphins and killer whales was compared to the published skin microbiota of 11 terrestrial and marine vertebrates namely Human- pig humpback whaleand eight teleostean fish species.

Partial R-squared R2 is the proportion of variation in the dissimilarity matrix explained by the tested factor.Cetacean skin microbiota was characterized by functions involved in genetic information processing espe- cially pathways related to DNA repair and recombination proteins Supplementary Information S7 DNA replication and translation especially from 0.9 to 1.3 of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis in skin communities.Comparison of cetacean microbiota with other vertebrate microbiotas.

Predominant clades in skin microbiota of dolphins and killer whales sampled for this study were distinct from skin microbiota reported for terrestrial and marine vertebrates Fig.

In panel B the error bars associatedto the 3 top bars are the standard deviation across the two Bray-Curtis values obtained from the separated comparison of dolphin and killer whale skin-associated microbiota with human fish and pig's microbiota respectively.consistent with the motile heterotrophic lifestyle of surface planktonic communities competing for nutrients.
