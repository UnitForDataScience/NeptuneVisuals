interestingly there was a change in the decision on fmt and .when comparing cd versus uc responders 195 of 327 cd responders and 149 of 234 uc responders stated that they would agree to fmt at the end of the questionnaire with no statistically difference between the two groups or  0.89 95 ci 0.55-1.43 p  0.72. also whencomparing men versus women or  1.21 95 ci 0.76-1.94 p  0.48 and patients with mild versus severe disease or  0.71 95 ci 0.34-1.47 p  0.38 therewas no statistically significant difference.

however patients are actively asking for this type of treatment and in particular on the internet there are 'do-it-yourself' home protocols for fmt and reports on patients' own fmt experiences performed by themselves two recent studies suggested that patients would actually be very interested in performing fmt in a hospital setting as a treatment for their ibd here we aimed to assess the view of a broad number of ibd patients with respect to fmt as a potential treatment option.methodsstudy designthe study was approved by the local ethical committees approval number kek-zh-nr.
