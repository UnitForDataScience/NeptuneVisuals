Patients in the current study however were hospitalized at the time of treatment and even though they had not received treatment for CDI they were currently receiving or had recently received other antimicrobials for the treatment of infec- tious diseases other than CDI.

To date there are no reports on the use of FMT as initial treatment for CDI in hospitalized patients.The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of FMT-FURM as first-line therapy of C. difficile infection in intestinal microbiome.Material and methodsInformed consentThe study was reviewed and approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the School of Medi- cine of the Universidad Auto'noma de Nuevo Leo'n Approval IF14-005.

FMT has shown to be a safer and more effective treatment than a prolonged vancomycin regimen in recurrent CDI cases with clinical efficacies of 90 vs. 26 in one study  and 94 vs. 23 in another study .

In this scenario we intend to perform a long-term follow-up study in our patients.Overall our results revealed that the microbiome in the healthy donors' pool was different from the microbial composition of all the patient samples regardless of treatment age the number of transplants etc.The average age of the donors 23.7 years was lower than the mean age of the patients 46.7 years in vancomycin group and 39.7 years in FMT group.

Thus the small perturbation observed in this community may be indicative of less damage to the microbiome and may have contributed to efficacy in this therapy group.Apart from the fact that FMT-FURM was performed as an initial treatment for CDI there are two additional interesting points that distinguish our study from other standard FMT treatments.

Given that the baseline and modifying factors are so different between the traditional FMT patients and our population treatment response rates and microbiome changes should be carefully evaluated.

We speculate that the exposure to antibiotics before andor after FMT-FURM treatment negatively influ- enced the resolution of CDI even after re-transplantation.It has been widely described the use of more than one infusion of FMT in the failure ofresponse with up to four times for recurrent or unresolved symptoms.

To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the effect on fecal microbiota of FMT as a first-line treatment for CDI.Supporting informationS1 File.
