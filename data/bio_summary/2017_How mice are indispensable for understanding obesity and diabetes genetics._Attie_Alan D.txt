The important exceptions contribute to discrepanciesAttie et al.Page 3between genotype-phenotype relations.

With newly-developed mouse resources it is now possible to achieve power and mapping resolution of tens of thousands of humans with only hundreds of mice.IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT A MUTANT MOUSETwo classic discoveriesLeptin insightful physiology genetic triumph epistatic interactions--Long before gene discovery was feasible physiological studies led to insights not only aboutAttie et al.Page 4satiety control but also about hormonal regulation of multi-organ systems and gene interaction networks that coordinate metabolic activities.

ByAttie et al.Page 5identifying these genes clues are obtained about molecular and physiological functions.

Genetic factors also contribute where a genetic variant in a strain that is resistant to diet-induced metabolic conditions epigenetically transferred resistance to a genetically-susceptible strain with resistance persisting forAttie et al.Page 6multiple generations and reversible with specific crosses 47.

At present the DO colony has reachedAttie et al.Page 723 generations of outcrossing and can simultaneously achieve high resolution and high power to detect small allelic effects.

Finally CSSs have been used to identify modifier genes that control phenotypicAttie et al.Page 8outcomes with a recent example being the Moda1 locus which suppresses diabetes in the HNF1a model of MODY3 maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 71.Chemical mutagenesisChemical mutagenesis has been used to induce mutations in mice.
