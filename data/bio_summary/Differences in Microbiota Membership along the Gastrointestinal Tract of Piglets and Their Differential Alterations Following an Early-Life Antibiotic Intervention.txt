Collectively these results indicated that the antibiotic intervention had profound effects on the lumen of the stomach and small intestine but few effects on the mucosa.Effect of the Antibiotic Intervention on the Representative Dominant OTUs in PigletsBased on a 97 confidence level at the species level OTU the relative abundance of the major dominant phylotypes in the lumen and mucosa was identified Supplementary Tables S6 S7.Among the top 50 dominant phylotypes in the lumen the antibiotic intervention significantly altered the relative abundance of 12 OTUs in the stomach 7 OTUs in the duodenum 17 OTUs in the jejunum 2 OTUs in the ileum and 3 OTUs in the colon Supplementary Figure S4.

It is widely regarded that compared to the microbial numbers in the colon 1011-1012 CFUmL stomach and small intestine have relatively low numbers of bacteria with 101-103 CFUmL in the lumen of stomach and duodenum and 104-107 CFUmL in the lumen of jejunum and ileum  .

The present study showed clear spatial variation of microbial communities in the stomach and intestine and found that the administration of antibiotics a mixture of olaquindox oxytetracycline calcium kitasamycin in early life caused markedly differential alterations in the compartmentalized microbiota with major alterations in their spatial variation in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine.

The microbial composition differs in lumen and mucosa of small intestine characterized as the higher Anaerobacter and lower Prevotella in the lumen than mucosa in ileum  .

Analysis of molecular variance AMOVA   was performed to compare the difference between lumen and mucosa antibiotic and control and adjacent gut segments.Here we defined the segments to represent longitudinal locations from stomach to colon and niches to represent radial locations from mucosa to lumen.

In the present study the relative abundances of Escherichia Pseudomonas and Haemophilus were high in the lumen of the stomach and duodenum but reduced in the lumen of the jejunum and ileum.

The microbial diversity was higher in the lumen of stomach and duodenum than that in ileum.

The early-life antibiotic intervention decreased the abundance of some Lactobacillus species and increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic Streptococcus suis in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine.

The relative abundance of Tenericutes decreased in the lumen of the stomach and colon in the antibiotic- treated piglets compared with the control group P  0.05 .

The relative abundance of Clostridium disporicum OTU1212 Eubacterium biforme OTU1865 and L. mucosae OTU1088 decreased in the antibiotic intervention group in the lumen of the stomach duodenum and jejunum q  0.05.
