For example Bacteroides fragilis-derived EVs carrying polysaccharide A delivered to intestinal dendritic cells and could be sensed by TLR2 and also Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron EVs contain hydrolytic enzymes that increase the potential digestion of gut microbiota by sharing these enzymes with bacteria lacking the hydrolytic enzymes Shen et al.

According to the complexity of gut microbiota and its interaction with the host it is crucial to investigate the immune system and structures of microbiota which have a regulative character Thaiss et al.

In addition gut microbiota generates various diet-independent metabolites which include lipopolysaccharide LPS and peptidoglycan PG as well as EVs Caricilli and Saad 2013.In the intestinal immune system maintaining homeostasis is challenging Van Den Elsen et al.

Therefore we propose that in leaky gut syndrome the probable harmful effect of gut microbiota could be replacedand inverted by gut microbiota-derived EVs treatment.DOES ANY OF EVS HAVE PRIORITY TO BE CALLED BENEFICIALIn a fascinating study Kang et al.

The gut microbiota has been developed in the presence of host cells and has demonstrated significant effects on host responses Lloyd-Price et al.

The interaction between gut microbiota and the host involves a complex network of signaling pathways Thompson et al.

The EV-based network likely represents important relationships creating organized ecological units within the intestinal microbiota Mitsuhashi et al.

Also the gut microbiota affects other communication pathways between the gut and the brainincluding the nervous immune and endocrine systems Van Den Elsen et al.

We propose to use various EVs not only as adjuvants for vaccination Moshiri et al.

2015.The characterization of EVs biological roles has become a fascinating research field due to their potential properties in vaccination therapeutic applications as vehicle in drug delivery and target therapy positional assembly of enzyme expression and their ability in carrying small molecule activators and inhibitors of quorum sensing Moshiri et al.
