IL-1 receptor antagonist administration ameliorated intestinal radiation injury.Conclusions The results demonstrate that rectal radiation induces dysbiosis which transmits radiation and inflammatory susceptibility and provide evidence that microbial-induced radiation tissue damage is at least in part mediated by IL-1b.

Gut 20176797-107. doi10.1136gutjnl-2017-31378997interleukin 2 IL-2 IL-6 IL-8 and particularly IL-1b.We have previously shown that IL-1b was also most closely correlated with tissue injury in a mouse radiation proctitis RP model.Previous attempts to minimise radiation injury included use of free radical scavengers and improved radiation techniques.

Using a total body radiation model it was shown that administration of Salmonella flagellin had a protective effect from GI radiation damage by suppressing apoptosis.However a study using GF mice demonstrated that these mice were markedly resistant to lethal radiation.

Herein we assessed the radiation effect on microbiota and its relationship to tissue damage using a rectal radiation mouse model.Design We evaluated luminal and mucosa-associated dysbiosis in irradiated and control mice at two postradiation time points and correlated it with clinical and immunological parameters.

Correlations were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient.RESULTSLocally delivered rectal radiation induces inflammation colonic tissue injury and inflammatory cytokine expression mimicking human RPIn the current study we took advantage of our previously devel- oped mouse RP model using localised rectal radiation.

Incubation time was limited to 6-7 hours.These results support the contention that compositional changes in the microbiota resulting from radiation treatment impact epithelial cells in a manner that may be associated with the pathogenesis of radiation-induced damage.Radiation-induced dysbiosis transmits susceptibility to RPTo further assess the in vivo impact of radiation-induced micro- biota on colonic tissue injury we inoculated GF mice with faecal microbiota obtained from irradiated and naive mice and exposed them to radiation.

Mice inoculated with radiation-induced microbiota exhibited more severe pathological features of radiation damage compared with mice inoculated Gut microbiota Figure 2 Faecal microbiota composition alternation following radiation treatment at various time points.

Taken together these results demonstrate that radiation treat- ment affected faecal microbiota in a way that transmitted a proinflammatory signal at least in response to radiation and DSS administration.IL-1 is a major mediator of colonic tissue damage in radiation-induced mucosal injuryAs noted previous studies demonstrated that IL-1b expression had the strongest correlation with both RIS and the inflamma- tory scoresee online S2.

Taken together with the GF experiments these observations support a sequence of events in which radiation alters the intestinal microbiota leading to increased host IL-1b secre- tion which in turn aggravates radiation-induced tissue damage.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated that radiation treatment induced loca- lised dysbiosis which was associated with postradiation tissue damage as evident by the fact that the microbiome of radiated mice had pathogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo.

This effect was transmissible by faecal transplantation.The abundance of Sutterella in the radiation model herein suggests that radiation may drive inflammation through similar mechanisms hence promoting the inflammatory response and aggravating tissue damage.The use of anakinra does not allow differentiation between IL-1a and IL-1b effects.
