No OTUs were shared by fish fed diet A or diet C. Three different OTUs belonging to the genus Staphylococcus were shared only by fish fed diet A or diet B and one OTU of the genus Burkholderia was shared by fish fed diet B or diet C.At the end of the second feeding period 93 dpff all fish were pooled for their first feeding diet because of the non-significant interaction of first and second feeding diets.

Moreover 20 additional fish per treatment were weighed at the end of the first feeding period and 60 additional fish per treatment at the end of the second feeding period 20 fish per triplicate aquarium.

In recent years the development of rapid and precise culture-independent techniques like next-generation sequencing NGS has led to the discov- ery that enzyme producing bacteria within the fish intestinal microbiome can positively influ- ence nutrient digestibility in several fish species by excreting digestive enzymes like amylase cellulase lipase or even phytase see detailed review by Ray Ghosh and Ringo .

With significantly decreasing marine fish stocks and an increasing demand for fish as a protein source for human consumption plant-derived proteins as an alternative feed source for fishmeal have been of high commercial and scientific interest during the past decades  especially for carnivorous species such as salmonids.

The index was significantly higher p0.05 for fish fed diet C than for fish fed diet A or diet B.

Abundances of Actinobacteria were significantly increased p0.05 in fish of diet group A compared to fish of the diet groups B and C. The rel- ative abundances of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria however did not differ between diets at the end of the first feeding period.After the diet change no significant interaction between the first feeding diet and the sec- ond feeding diet was detected for the top five phyla.

Additionally the gut microbiome of fish fed diet A is very similar to the microbiome of fish fed diet B.

One possibility could be stress Even though the stocking density in each tank was according to approved recommendations for small trout fry  high variation in growth rates between individual fish could have caused aggression territorial or dominant behavior and thus lead to a higher stress level in smaller fish.

At the end of the second feeding period 93 dpff the number of observed OTUs significantly increased when fish were continuously fed with diet A or dietIt can be speculated whether the stable number of OTUs present in samples of fish continu- ously fed with diet C is related to the significantly reduced growth or to the already highernumber of observed OTUs after the first feeding period.
