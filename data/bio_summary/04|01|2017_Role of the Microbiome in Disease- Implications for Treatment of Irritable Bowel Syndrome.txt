the current working hypothesis is that altered composition and metabolic activ- ity of the gut microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses and inflammation.917 these processes in turn increase mucosal permeability promote epithelial barrier dysfunction activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dys- regulate the enteric nervous system.treatment approaches focused on altering the gut microbiomewhile our knowledge about the gut microbiome and its role in ibs pathophysiology continue to develop the gut micro- biota has been a therapeutic target for years if not decades.17dietary modificationdiet has been shown to significantly influence the composi- tion and metabolic activity of thegut microbiota.

neomycin produced a 50 improve- ment in global ibs symptoms compared with placebo but also induced rapid bacterial resistance.22the rifamycin-derivative rifaximin is an oral nonsys- temic broad-spectrum antibiotic associated with a low bac- terial resistance profile and a favorable side-effect profile.20 rifaximin appears to have anti-inflammatory host-response and gut microbiota modulatory activities.34 rifaximin has shown efficacy in several small-scale studies of ibs as well as 2 large-scale identically designed phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trials targeted non-systemic antibiotic rifaximin gut selective evaluation treatment target 1 and target 2 table.2035in target 1 and target 2 patients affected by ibs without constipation n1258 received either rifaximin 550 mg or placebo 3 times daily for 2 weeks then were fol- table target-1 -2 and -3 trials for rifaximin in the management of irritable bowel syndrome2035abbreviations ae adverse event bid twice daily db double-blind ibs irritable bowel syndrome pbo placebo pbo-c placebo-controlled r randomized target targeted non-systemic antibiotic rifaximin gut selective evaluation treatment tid 3 times daily.apatients included in modified intention-to-treat analysis.bdefined as relief of symptoms for 2 of first 4 weeks of treatment by self-report.cdefined as a decrease in abdominal pain 30 from baseline and a decrease in frequency of loose stools 50 from baseline for 2 weeks during a 4-week posttreat- ment period.lowed for an additional 10 weeks.20 significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of global ibs symptoms during the first 4 weeks after treatment table.2035 the percentage of patients with adequate relief decreased over time in both groups but remained higher for patients treated with rifaximin com- pared with patients receiving placebo during all 3 months in both studies.

the human microbiome is the collective genome ie genetic material of all the microorganisms living in association with the human body the vast majority of which reside in the distal gut.78 the gut microbiota refers to the complex ecosystem of more than a thousand microbial species inhabiting the intestine most of which are bacteria and accounts for 60 of the fecal bio- mass.6910 while research is still in its infancy these programs suggest that microorganisms carry out a range of biological functions critical to the health of the individual.11emerging evidence also suggests that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota dysbiosis correlate with numerous diseases including type 1 and type 2 diabe- tes obesity asthma and several cancers as well as anxiety and depression.712-15 perhaps least surprising is the increas-brian e. lacy phd md professor of medicine chief section of gastroenterology  hepatology dartmouth-hitchcock medical center lebanon nhdisclosuresdr.

a proposed algorithm suggests a logical approach for utili- zation of diet probiotics and antibiotics in clinical practice to manipulate the gut microbiota in the management of patients with ibs.
