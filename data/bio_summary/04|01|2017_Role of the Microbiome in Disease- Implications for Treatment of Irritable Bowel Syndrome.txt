Treatment was well tolerated.35Although not indicated for IBS-C constipation pre- dominant rifaximin 400 mg 3 times daily for 7-10 days has been evaluated in patients with IBS-C in 2 small double-blind trials.36 In one trial rifaximin plus neomycin significantly improved severity of constipation and symp- toms of bloating and straining for up to 4 weeks comparedwith neomycin plus placebo.36 In the other trial which uti- lized a crossover design rifaximin significantly decreased bloating abdominal pain abdominal distension and flatu- lence compared with placebo.37Overall these data suggest that rifaximin with its favor- able safety profile and demonstrated efficacy is a therapeutic option for patients with IBS-D.Other prescription medicationsAlosetron a selective 5-HT3 antagonist and eluxadoline a mixed opioid receptor agonistantagonist are also approved for IBS-D but have no effect on the gut microbiome.Fecal microbiota transplantationFecal microbiota transplantation FMT involves oral administration of encapsulated fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy person who serves as a donor.14 The goal is to treat disease by restoring microbiota typically found in a healthy person.

The human microbiome is the collective genome ie genetic material of all the microorganisms living in association with the human body the vast majority of which reside in the distal gut.78 The gut microbiota refers to the complex ecosystem of more than a thousand microbial species inhabiting the intestine most of which are bacteria and accounts for 60 of the fecal bio- mass.6910 While research is still in its infancy these programs suggest that microorganisms carry out a range of biological functions critical to the health of the individual.11Emerging evidence also suggests that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota dysbiosis correlate with numerous diseases including type 1 and type 2 diabe- tes obesity asthma and several cancers as well as anxiety and depression.712-15 Perhaps least surprising is the increas-Brian E.

The current working hypothesis is that altered composition and metabolic activ- ity of the gut microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses and inflammation.917 These processes in turn increase mucosal permeability promote epithelial barrier dysfunction activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dys- regulate the enteric nervous system.Treatment approaches focused on altering the gut microbiomeWhile our knowledge about the gut microbiome and its role in IBS pathophysiology continue to develop the gut micro- biota has been a therapeutic target for years if not decades.17Dietary modificationDiet has been shown to significantly influence the composi- tion and metabolic activity of thegut microbiota.

FMT has been effective for Clostridium difficile infection generating speculation that the process may benefit other conditions associated with dysbiosis including IBS.14Data about the efficacy of FIGURE Suggested algorithm for gut microbiota-targeted therapy for IBSFMT for IBS are scanty and far from conclusive at this time con- sisting primarily of several case series reporting relief of symp- toms in patients with IBS who do not respond to conventionaltherapy.213839 Among concerns regarding FMT is the potential for long-term risks that may manifest as the development of chronic disease based on alterations in the gut microbiota.14 For exam- ple transplantation of human fecal microbiota from obese sub- jects to rodents has been shown to transmit an obesity pheno- type.40 FMT from lean subjects to obese subjects with metabolic syndrome on the other hand has proven beneficial includ- ing an increase in insulin sen- sitivity.41 Well-designed large randomized controlled studies are required before FMT can be considered a therapeutic option in IBS.IMPLICATIONSFOR CLINICAL PRACTICEWhile our understanding of the role of the gut microbiotaYesYesNoYesNoand dysbiosis in IBS contin- ues to evolve several treatment approaches that target the gut microbiota have already demon- strated efficacy in IBS.

Our rapidly accumulating knowledge about the pathophysiologic role of disturbances in the gut microbiota in IBS has prompted manipulation of the microbiota as a new therapeutic target for the disorder.

modulate several mechanisms that might be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS including effects on intestinal microbiota composition GI dysmotility visceral hypersensitivity altered gut epithelium and immune func- tion and luminal metabolism.22 Interpreting results from probiotic studies in IBS is challenging due to inclusion of patients with different IBS subtypes and the use of multi- ple probiotic strains and doses across studies which may obscure the beneficial effects of individual strains within that species.1932In a meta-analysis of 35 studies of probiotics vs placebo for IBS the persistence of IBS symptoms with probiotics was lower with a relative risk of 0.79 95 confidence interval 0.70-0.89.

Some combinations of probiotics were superior to individual spe- cies or strains although no specific combination was supe- rior to another.19 Adverse events were more common with probiotics 16.5 compared with placebo 13.8 with a number needed to harm NNH of 35.19AntibioticsThe alteration of the gut microbiota and particularly the possible role of an SIBO in at least some patients with IBS has prompted the evaluation of antibiotics as a treatment for IBS.22 Neomycin a nonabsorbable antibiotic was the first investigated for IBS.
