Two studies focused solely on B. fragilis and another two studies were restricted to B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron .

As found in studies reporting resistance rates in B. fragilis group bacteria isolated from clinical samples the reported prevalences from faecal samples vary sig- nificantly among studies and geographical locations.

In most studies B. fragilis and B. vulgatus constitute the majority of species isolated but in a few reports other species such as B. thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides distasonis now Parabacteroides distasonis dominated .

Three non-duplicate isolates were isolated from each of 56 samples two non-duplicate isolates were isolated from each of 77 samples and one non-duplicate isolate was isolated from each of the remaining 37 samples with growth of B. fragilis group species.

This variability confirms the need for susceptibility testing of clinical isolates in the B. fragilis group and for conducting confirmatory studies to verify extreme find- ings reported from previous studies.ConclusionWe have established a baseline of antimicrobial susceptibility rates in the B. fragilis group in relatively antibiotic-naive healthy Danish children.

In addition a lit- erature review was conducted to summarise current knowledge on the antimicrobial susceptibility rates of B. fragilis group bacteria in the human gut.Materials and methodsFaecal samples isolate selection procedure and identificationFaecal samples had previously been collected as part of an open cohort study investigating the role of enteroaggregative Escheri- chia coli in childhood diarrhoea at Danish day-care centres .

In the cohort of children examined with very limited antimicrobial exposure resistance rates in B. fragilis group isolates from faecal samples were comparable with reported ob- servations of clinical samples in Denmark.

Non-susceptibility in faecal samples  and clinical samples in most studies varies from 0 to 3 for metronidazole and 1-10 for carbapenems .

Increasing rates of reduced antimicrobial suscepti- bility in the B. fragilis group have been registered and reports of treatment failure attributed to infections with resistant B. fragilis isolates stress the importance of mapping the epidemiology of an- timicrobial resistance .

Species re- ported as Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides vulgatus by the Biotyper database are reported here as B. ovatusxylanisolvens and B. vulgatus dorei respectively as these species cannot be correctly differentiated by MALDI-TOFMS .
