The association between the sample name sample ID index and Blastocystis colonization status and group is available in Supplementary File 1.The data analyzed using the home-made metagenomics pipeline 1 are available on the PEGASE- biosciences website The taxonomic assignment before data normalization is available per sample in the OTUcounttables tsv files Data Citation 2 and the rawglobal.biom file Data Citation 2 and after data normalization process described in the Methods section in the normalizedglobal.biom file Data Citation 2.Finally the four home-made scripts used in the bioinformatics pipeline 1 are available in the scripts.zip file Data Citation 2.Technical ValidationData quality checkAs shown in 2 the quality scores of the raw Ion Torrent reads average Q27 are quite stable across the reads above the Q20 reported accuracy for Ion Torrent PGM sequencing.

the OTU count tables OTUcounttables tsv files Data Citation 2 and the BIOM file before data normalization rawglobal BIOM file Data Citation 2 and iii the final BIOM file normalizedglobal BIOM file Data Citation 2.

The home-made scripts are available in Figshare scripts.zip file Data Citation 2.The preprocessing step 1 using Mothur v1.27.0and home-made scripts scripts.zip file Data Citation 2 filtered the raw data Data Citation 1 to minimize erroneous reads generated by the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer.

The intermediate files allow the scientific community to monitor evaluate andor optimize certain analytical steps whereas the final BIOM file normalizedglobal BIOM file Data Citation 2 allows the confirmation of our biological results particularly the higher bacterial diversity in faecal microbiota of Blastocystis colonized patients as well as a comparison of the available tools for secondary analysis of targeted metagenomic data.

Graphically it presents the number of OTUs theoretically observed for a range number of sequences into the sample at variable distances 91 93 95 97.For each sample the output of this second analytical step is an OTU table file OTUcounttables tsv file Data Citation 2 containing four columns the first column is the consensus read name associated to the OTU the second column is the OTU raw counts the third column is the consensus read name same as the first column and the fourth column is the associated taxon.

The characteristics of these OTUcounttables files are summarized in 1.In the third analytical step of the home-made pipeline 1 all the annotated OTU tables were merged into a global OTU table using a home-made python script v2.7.3 OTUtablesmerge.py script from scripts.zip file Data Citation 2 based on each OTU's taxonomic annotation.The Global OTU table is a tabulation-formatted file TSV in which each column of this table represents one sample and each line represents one taxon identified by its OTU identifier in the first column and by the taxonomic annotation in the last column.

Mothur EspritTree QIIMEor DESeq2 databases the Silva small subunit RNA databaseand Ribosomal Database Project RDP and home-made PerlPython scripts.we report the Ion Torrent raw sequencing data Data Citation 1 and provide a full description of the bioinformatics pipeline we used for the analysis 1.

They include i the raw sequencing data Data Citation 1 ii the intermediate files from our home-made 16S targeted metagenomic analysis pipeline i.e.

The OTUs were classified using classify.seqs in Mothur v1.27.0with the SILVA 102 databaseand the RDP taxonomy1.Intra-sample rarefaction curves were generated using the home-made rarefaction curve plotting tool rarefaction.R in scripts.zip file Data Citation 2.

The characteristics of the BIOM file Data Citation 2 are summarized in 2.As advised by previous recommendations the DESeq2 packageintegrated into QIIME v1.9.0 was used to normalize the total read counts and avoid rarefaction of the read count data.
