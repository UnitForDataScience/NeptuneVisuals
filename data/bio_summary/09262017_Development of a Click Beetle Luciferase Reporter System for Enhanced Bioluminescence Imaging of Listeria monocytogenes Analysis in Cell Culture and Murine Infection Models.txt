In particular L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2CBRopt was clearly visible through multiple layers of raw beef steak whereas the penetrating power of light generated in L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2luxPHELP was poor and below detectable limits .BLI of CBRopt during a Cell Invasion AssayThe pPL2luxPHELP vector has previously proved effective for the imaging of L. monocytogenes infection in cultured mammalian cells  .

For this purpose L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2CBRopt L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2luxPHELPand L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2lux were used to infect C2Bbe1 cells for 1 h and the levels of bioluminescence and number of the intracellular bacteria were determined .

Of these the highest number of CFU was recovered from the spleen where CFUml were in the range of 1 103.Notably mice infected with L. monocytogenes EGDempPL2CBRopt produced detectable bioluminescence signals at 48 h post-infection while no signals were detected from mice infected with L. monocytogenes EGDempPL2luxPHELP or the L. monocytogenes EGDempPL2lux control.

L. monocytogenes EGDe   and murinized L. monocytogenes EGDem   were grown aerobically at 30C in brain heart infusion BHI medium Oxoid Basingstoke United Kingdom.

From each successful transformant one colony carrying the anticipated genotype was chosen for further bioluminescence analysis using an IVIS Lumina II system PerkinElmer.In Vitro Tissue Depth ModelListeria monocytogenes EGDepPL2CBRopt L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2lux silent vector or L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2- luxPHELP expressing bacterial lux operon  were grown over night in BHI medium.

The sequence of the insert was verified and the novel vector was then transformed and integrated into the L. monocytogenes EGDe wild type strain and an engineered L. monocytogenes variant EGDem expressing a murine-specific InlA  .

We directly compared the bioluminescence of L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2CBRopt with the L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2luxPHELP strain as both bioluminescent vectors are constructed using the pPL2 backbone with expression of luciferase under the same PHELP promoter system  .

Signal transmission and total flux of bacterial luciferase L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2luxPHELP quickly declined as the thickness of the tissue increased as compared to CBRopt L. monocytogenes EGDepPL2CBRopt.

We have developed a click beetle red luciferase CBR-luc based vector pPL2CBRopt expressing codon optimized CBR-luc under the control of a highly expressed Listerial promoter PHELP for L. monocytogenes and have compared this to a lux-based system expressing bacterial luciferase for BLI of the pathogen using in vitro growth experiments and in vivo models.
