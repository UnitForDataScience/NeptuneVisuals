The study of oat hay supplementation timing in calves explored the effect of hay supplementation in different periods on the rumen microbiota in calves from a microbial perspective.2  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Experimental animals and designWe selected 18 seven-day-old Holstein dairy bull calves in similar body condition weighing 42 - 3 kg each.

For example most producers in the United States choose to supplement hay for weaning calves mainly fed on milk and starter this is because early feeding of hay will partially replace the feeding of starter and thus affects the rumen developmentThis is an open access article under the terms of the License which permits use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.c 2017 The Authors.

The above two feeding systems seem to be contradictory.So we have researched on the calves hay supplementation time effect on rumen development and production performance.

The calves were weaned at 9 weeks of age feeding trial then ended.

The feed intake and health condition of the calves were checked regularly in the morning at noon and during the night.

The major phyla showing differences between samples in- cluded Bacteroidetes Actinobacteria and Firmicutes Figure 3.phyla were detected in the rumen fluid of all calves.

The MSO2 and MSO6 groups were significantly lower than the MS group for Butyricimonas Bacteroidetes Parabacteroides Bacteroidetes Porphyromonas BacteroidetesFIGURE 3 Heatmap showing species richness in the rumen fluid samples of the calves.

In the United Kingdom hay is mainly supplemented for calves at 2-3 weeks of age the calves are also fed on starter and milk to promote rumination increase rumen pH and benefit rumen health and development Castells Bach  Terre 2012 Coverdale Tyler Quigley  Brumm 2004 Khan Weary  Von Keyserlingk 2011.

This can be related to saliva reflux in the oral cavity of the cattle.5  CONCLUSIONS Hay supplementation time did not affect the diversity of the rumen mi- crobiota in the suckling calves with the condition that supplementation of oat hay from week 2 calves or week 6 on the basis of milk and starter.
