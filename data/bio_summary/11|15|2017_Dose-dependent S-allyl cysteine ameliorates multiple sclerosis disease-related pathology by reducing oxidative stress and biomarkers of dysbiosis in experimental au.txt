this suggests that sac causes increases in bdnf.finally the different effects of nac and sac on lbp and lps levels could be as followsthe low oral bioavailability of nac could contribute to elucidate the increase in lbp produced upon oral administration of nac.

18 mgkg dose of nac did not cause any progression of the disorder whereas 50 mgkg of nac as well as sac treatment prompted a re- duction in this parameter .meanwhile some correlations were determinedbrain the clinical score at the end of study 35 days showed a positive correlation with lpo r  0.712 p  0.001 total glutathione r  0.443 p  0.001 gssg levels r  0.433 p  0.001 and lbp r 0.486 p  0.01 whereas d clinical score correlated with lpo r  0.557 p  0.001 tnfa r  0.584 p  0.01 and lbp r  0.428 p  0.05.spinal cord clinical score at 35 days positively correlated with lpor  0.556 p  0.001 gssg r  0.747 p  0.001 and lbp levels r 0.446 p  0.05 whereas the increase of clinical score 35-14 days correlated with lpo r  0.563 p  0.01. furthermore we noted a negative correlation between clinical score 35 and gshgssg ratio r - 0.514 r  0.01.blood the clinical score at the end of study showed a positive correlation with lpo r  0.474 p  0.001 and lbp r  0.659 p  0.001 whereas the increase of clinical score 35-14 days corre- lated with lpo r  0.425 p  0.01 and lbp r  0.545 p  0.01. inaddition a negative correlation was observed between the increase of clinical score 35-14 days and gshgssg ratio r  - 0.366 p  0.05.changes in levels of lipid peroxidation products lpo and glutathione systemoxidative damage was evaluated as lpo whereas the antioxidant status was evaluated as well as the status of the glutathione redox system in blood brain and spinal cord tissue.mog caused a significant increase in lpo levels in all the tissues studied blood brain and spinal cord against those of control group p  0.001 .

these symptoms were reversed towards normality after treatment with sac and nac being sac administration more effective than that of nac.

oral bioavailability of nac is below 10  as a large proportion of the molecule binds to mucin and reduces disulphide bonds and this effect explains the widely known mucolytic effect of nac one of its main clinical uses.

the above experiments considered together with a very high bioavailability of sac  90 suggest that sac would be devoid of mucolytic activity contrary to nac and that the latter's activity would induce a low level endotoxemia that in the long term could be harmful to patients receiving supplements containing either nac or free cysteine for the prevention or amelioration of chronic diseases.

in this work two doses of sac were compared with two dose of n-acetyl cysteine nac.

sac was more effective than nac and it prevented the harmful effects induced by mog more effectively at the dose of 50 mgkg than that of 18 mgkg.

surprisingly nac increases lbp levels while sac had not such negative effect.

they were kept under controlled temperature conditions 20-23 degc and illumination 12 h light12 h dark cycle lights on at 0800 h and supplied with food purinar spain and water ad libitum.treatments and experimental modelthe dosage and administration protocols of administration were i n-acetyl cysteine nac administered at 50 or 18 mgkg bw oral in- take daily for 21 days five days per weeks cinfa s.a. pamplona spain and ii sac 50 or 18 mgkg bw oral intake daily for 21 days five days per weeks the compound was a gift from canvax biotech s.l.

thus in brain both nac and sac at the dose of 50 mgkg increased the gsh and gshgssg ratio p  0.05 and p  0.001 vs eae group respectively whereas they caused a significant reduction in gssg levels p  0.05 vs eae group.

the effect at 50 mgkg was greater in sac than in nac although the difference between both molecules was not statistically significant .

in spinal cord and blood we found similar data although in these tissues doses of 18 mgkg nac and sac showed antioxidant activity.
