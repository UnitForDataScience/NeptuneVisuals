However liver biopsy should still be considered in select scenarios Uncertainty about diagnosis of AH due to incomplete or inconsistent history or equivocal laboratory or imaging findingsConcern about coexisting liver injury which may occur in 20  of patients with ALDTo assess the severity of AH before starting treatment particularly corticosteroidsTo assess for chronicity or fibrosis and thereby provide more accurate prognosis for the patient although transient elastography may supplant biopsy for this indication in the futureEnrollment in a clinical trial which requires liver biopsy to enhance patient homogenizationThe approach for liver biopsy could be transjugular or percutaneous depending on clinician preference and resource availability.

The transjugular route is generally recommended if the patient has ascites or significant coagulopathy to reduce risk of complications Class 1 Level C .The potential confounders of clinical SAH on liver biopsy ASH are age obesity nonalcoholic steatohepatitis coex- isting hepatitis C iron overload and primary biliary cir- rhosis due to presence of Mallory-Denk bodies -.Noninvasive diagnostic modalitiesGiven the limitations and potential complications of liver biopsy there is a need for alternative noninvasive methodsfor diagnosis and assessment of disease severity of AH.

Acam- prosate has been shown to reduce withdrawal symptoms including alcohol craving .Baclofen This GABA-b antagonist shows effi- cacy and safety in maintaining higher abstinence rates longer duration of abstinence and improved liver function tests in patients with alcoholic liver disease in randomized controlled trials RCTs .

Liver progenitor cells proliferate to form narrow ductules which radiate out into the damaged liver parenchyma.

A paradigm shift from antiinflammatory therapy such as corticosteroids to liver regeneration treatment e.g.

Liver transplantation should be offered to select patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who are nonresponsive to medical treatment.Keywords Alcoholic hepatitis  Corticosteroids  Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor  Molecular targeted therapy  Liver transplantationIntroductionAlcoholic liver disease ALD includes a broad spectrum of entities from simple steatosis acute alcoholic hepatitis with or without underlying cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma as a complication of cirrhosis.

Appropriate diagnosis prognostication and better treatment options are essential to improve the sur- vival rate.Alcoholic hepatitisAlcoholic hepatitis is defined as a syndrome of progressive inflammatory liver injury associated with decades of heavy alcohol use chronic active alcohol abuse 60-80 g in males and 20-40 g in females  .

The best biomarkers ofalcohol use are c-glutamyltransferase GGT carbohy- drate-deficient transferrin CDT mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase AST ethyl glucuronide ETG and phosphatidyl ethanol .Clinical criteria for alcoholic hepatitisThe clinical criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are jaundice with duration 3 months jaundice as first decompensating liver event serum bilirubin 5 mgdL ASTalanine aminotransferase ALT 21 AST 500 IUL ALT300 IUL and neutrophilic leukocytosis  .

Moreover the facility for tran- sjugular liver biopsy is absent in most clinics and com- munity hospitals.

TAP scores of 36 or higher identified patients with AH area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92 with 90  sensitivity and 80  specificity versus patients with acute decompensation or individuals without liver disease.
