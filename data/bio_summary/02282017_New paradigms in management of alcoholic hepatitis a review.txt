However liver biopsy should still be considered in select scenarios Uncertainty about diagnosis of AH due to incomplete or inconsistent history or equivocal laboratory or imaging findingsConcern about coexisting liver injury which may occur in 20  of patients with ALDTo assess the severity of AH before starting treatment particularly corticosteroidsTo assess for chronicity or fibrosis and thereby provide more accurate prognosis for the patient although transient elastography may supplant biopsy for this indication in the futureEnrollment in a clinical trial which requires liver biopsy to enhance patient homogenizationThe approach for liver biopsy could be transjugular or percutaneous depending on clinician preference and resource availability.

The transjugular route is generally recommended if the patient has ascites or significant coagulopathy to reduce risk of complications Class 1 Level C .The potential confounders of clinical SAH on liver biopsy ASH are age obesity nonalcoholic steatohepatitis coex- isting hepatitis C iron overload and primary biliary cir- rhosis due to presence of Mallory-Denk bodies -.Noninvasive diagnostic modalitiesGiven the limitations and potential complications of liver biopsy there is a need for alternative noninvasive methodsfor diagnosis and assessment of disease severity of AH.
