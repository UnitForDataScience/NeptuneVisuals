In general these findings indicate that acarbose had more effects on ruminal fermentation when wheat was used as the substrate whereas it exhibited little effect on ruminal fermentation when beet pulp was used as the substrate.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus it is likely that acarbose could be used as a feed additive and have more effects on ruminal fermentation when wheat was used as thesubstrate.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China grant numbers 31372339.AcknowledgementThe authors are grateful to Hossam-eldin Seddik for language help.Appendix A.

Thus our study intended to investigate the effect of acarbose adjunction in shifting ruminal fermentation parameters as well as ruminal bacterial composition under two different substrates wheat and beet pulp in vitro by batch cultures technology.Materials and methodsAnimals and their treatmentsIn this experiment three rumen-cannulated Holstein cows initial body weight BW 500 - 23.5 kg mean - SD were used as rumen fluid donors.

Thus acarbose addition cannot prevent the occurrence of SARA induced by the beet pulp and it has little clear effect on microbial and fermentation patterns.Interestingly similar to the observation of changes in NH3-N concentration in the experiment using wheat as the substrate the present study revealed the presence of a higher NH3-N level in the acarbose groups than in the control group when beet pulp was used as the substrate suggesting that acarbose addition might result in the inefficiency of microbial protein synthesis as the energy released from fermentation remained stable during the experiment.The present research also showed that the richness indices did not differ between the control and acarbose groups when beet pulp was used as the substrate which is inconsistent with the results based on the use of wheat as the substrate.

Our data showed that acarbose addition decreased VFA concentration and increased pH value when wheat was used as the substrate but it was not effective when beet pulp was used as the substrate.

No significant shifts P  0.05 were identified in the pro- portion of the dominant genera Prevotella Anaeroplasma Rumino- coccus IncertaeSedis Treponema Oribacterium Succiniclasticum Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio between the control and acar- bose treatment groups.Diversity and structure of the ruminal microbiota compositionWhen wheat was used as the substrate rarefaction curves demonstrated that a significant effect on the diversity of rumen bacterial community was detected in the acarbose treatment groups compared to the control group A.

Moreover the outcome of the AMOVA illustrated that the compo- sition of the ruminal microbiota changed significantly after acar- bose addition Fs 93.76 P  0.001.When beet pulp was used as the substrate the results showed that the number of observed OTUs and the alpha diversity indices such as the Shannon index Chao 1 value and ACE value maintained consistency between the control and acarbose groups .

PCoA plots B and AMOVA Fs 0.20 P 0.659 based on unweighted UniFrac distance metrics also revealed that no signif- icant shifts P  0.05 were detected in the structure of ruminal microbiota with acarbose addition.Quantitative real-time PCR analysisWhen wheat was used as the substrate the amount of 16S rRNA bacterial gene copies in Firmicutes together with Bacteroidetes significantly decreased P  0.05 with acarbose addition .

In line with above studies severer decrease of TVFA concentration in the acarbose treatment which means poorer ruminal degradation of starch that might negatively influence the feed efficiency and rumen metabolism in practical conditions of feeding ruminants was observed in the present research with wheat used as the substrate.

This discordance in- dicates that the effect of acarbose on rumen bacterial community composition depends on the type of the fermentation substrate and it might play a positive role in modulating the ruminal microbiota when grain diet is used as substrate.Methodological issues of this researchIt is noteworthy that this research has some limitations.
