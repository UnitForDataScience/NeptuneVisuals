Receiver operating characteristic curve for the VFM diet score ability to predict the bottom and top tertiles of VFM.The nutrient profile of the VFM diet score is shown in Supplementary Table S5.VFM diet score metabolomics associationsWe identified 30 metabolites significantly associated P o1.71 x 10 - 4 with the VFM diet score after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing Supplementary Table S6.Following an adjustment for intakes of other foods Supplementary Table S6 all associations between metabolites and the VFM diet score remained strong Po0.01 although 6 no longer passed adjustment for multiple testing suggesting intakes of other foods may be important for these metabolite associations.Metabolites associated with the VFM diet score and food groups independentlyEighteen metabolites were significantly P o3.33 x 10 - 4 0.055 food groups x 30 metabolites associated with the food groups forming the VFM diet score following backward regression with all food groups Supplementary Table S6.

The ability of the VFM diet score to correctly classify subjects with high VFM sensitivity true- positive rate and correctly classify subjects with low VFM specificity true- negative rate of the model was predicted and the receiver operating characteristic curve generated by plotting the true-positive rate against the false-positive rate at multiple threshold settings.VFM diet score and VFM associations with metabolomics and the microbiomeDetails of the statistical analysis for the associations between the VFM diet score and VFM with blood metabolomics and microbiome taxa can be found in Supplementary Text S2.RESULTSVFM food group associationsThe characteristics of the study population can be found in Supplementary Table S3.We identified five significant food type associations with VFM in the training data set including fruits -0.005 0.001 P  1.95 x 10 - 5 red processed meat and eggs 0.016 0.005 P  3.94 x10 - 4 fermented dairy products -0.011 0.004 P  1.14 x 10 - 3 fried and fast foods 0.015 0.005 P  1.18 x 10 - 3 and whole- grain products -0.008 0.002 P  1.27 x 10 - 3.

In a recent study authors created a protective diet score using self- reported intakes of favorable and unfavorable foods to investigate gene x diet interactions in obesity in 68 317 subjects of European ancestry.In another study of 48 631 European men and women Angquist et al.created a summary score combining intakes of all food groups associated with changes in waist circumference over a median of 5.5 years.

These large studies have confirmed the utility of this approach to studying VF interactions with diet although the method has yet to be applied to omic data.Metabolomics is being used to bridge the knowledge gap between diet and its effect on metabolic diseases.

However the metabolomics profile of a metaboli- cally unhealthy diet has not been thoroughly characterized and those metabolites linking diet to VFM development been distinguished.Emerging evidence suggests a role for the intestinal microbiota in VF development by interacting with dietary components and contributing to the metabolomics profile.Early studies using rodents fed high-fat HF diets have shown HF feeding to increase Firmicutes and decrease Bacteriodetes reduce the class Clostridiaand increase sulfidogenic bacteria.Through mod- ulating the gut microbiome profile polyphenols from cranberry and pomegranate resveratrol and gluco-oligosaccharide have shown to be protective of obesity in HF feeding.The aims of this study were to identify foods most strongly associated with VFM in a population of UK twins to develop and1Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology Kings College London London UK 2Department of Nutrition Norwich Medical School University of East Anglia Norwich UK 3Metabolon Inc.

There- fore a higher VFM diet score is associated with a poorer diet quality.

We next gener- ated and evaluated the VFM diet score in the test group.The sensitivity of the VFM diet score was 93.72 the specificity was 92.70 and overall 93.21 of subjects were classified into the correct VFM tertile.

Whole-grain intake was significantly associated with five metabolites red processed meat and eggs with three metabolites and fried and fast food intakes with two metabolites.Metabolites associated with both the VFM diet and VFM Following a backward stepwise linear regression including all 30 metabolites 9 metabolites accounting for 14 of the varianceremained significantly associated with the VFM diet score 1.

After adjusting for multiple testing P o5.56 x 10 - 3 four of them were significantly associated with VFM indepen- dently of diet.Reduced hippurate and bilirubin ZZ and increased alpha- hydroxyisovalerate and butyrylcarnitine were all associated with increased VFM diet scores and VFM independently of the VFM diet and total body fat 1.
