whole-grain intake was significantly associated with five metabolites red processed meat and eggs with three metabolites and fried and fast food intakes with two metabolites.metabolites associated with both the vfm diet and vfm following a backward stepwise linear regression including all 30 metabolites 9 metabolites accounting for 14 of the varianceremained significantly associated with the vfm diet score 1. after adjusting for multiple testing p o5.56 x 10 - 3 four of them were significantly associated with vfm indepen- dently of diet.reduced hippurate and bilirubin zz and increased alpha- hydroxyisovalerate and butyrylcarnitine were all associated with increased vfm diet scores and vfm independently of the vfm diet and total body fat 1. associations between vfm and butyrylcarnitine 0.199 0.087 p  0.023 and hippurate -0.297 0.095 p  0.002 were significant in vfm-discordant mz twins 4 supplementary table s7.

in a recent study authors created a protective diet score using self- reported intakes of favorable and unfavorable foods to investigate gene x diet interactions in obesity in 68 317 subjects of european ancestry.in another study of 48 631 european men and women angquist et al.created a summary score combining intakes of all food groups associated with changes in waist circumference over a median of 5.5 years.

these large studies have confirmed the utility of this approach to studying vf interactions with diet although the method has yet to be applied to omic data.metabolomics is being used to bridge the knowledge gap between diet and its effect on metabolic diseases.

however the metabolomics profile of a metaboli- cally unhealthy diet has not been thoroughly characterized and those metabolites linking diet to vfm development been distinguished.emerging evidence suggests a role for the intestinal microbiota in vf development by interacting with dietary components and contributing to the metabolomics profile.early studies using rodents fed high-fat hf diets have shown hf feeding to increase firmicutes and decrease bacteriodetes reduce the class clostridiaand increase sulfidogenic bacteria.through mod- ulating the gut microbiome profile polyphenols from cranberry and pomegranate resveratrol and gluco-oligosaccharide have shown to be protective of obesity in hf feeding.the aims of this study were to identify foods most strongly associated with vfm in a population of uk twins to develop and1department of twin research and genetic epidemiology kings college london london uk 2department of nutrition norwich medical school university of east anglia norwich uk 3metabolon inc. durham nc usa and 4academic rheumatology clinical sciences building university of nottingham nottingham city hospital nottingham uk.

to calculate the score reported consumption frequencies of these food groups were quartile ranked and the quartiles assigned a score of 0-3 according to direction of the association that is positive association q1  0 q2  1q3  2 q4  3 negative association q1  3 q2  2 q3  1 q4  0. there- fore a higher vfm diet score is associated with a poorer diet quality.

average nutrient intakes by increasing tertile of the vfm diet score from clockwise lightest to darkest were assessed for percentage of the recommended intakes for 55-year-old women according to the uk dietary reference values.using vfm diet score by tertile as the predictor of the residual energy adjusted nutrient intakes in a linear regression statistically significant trends p o0.001 were observed for all nutrients except polyunsaturated fatty acids protein zinc and vitamin d. carotene and retinol are represented as percentage of the recommended intake for total retinol equivalents.
