disturbed composition of gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis or is a consequence of both intestinal inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome diverticulosis celiac disease as well as extraintestinal allergies asthma metabolic syndrome cardiovascular diseases systemic disorders 2 and cancers.appreciating the value of the proper composition of gut microflo- ra the authors made an attempt at verification whether and how supplementation using a single probiotic bacterial strain affect- ed the clinical presentation of the disease and the gut microbiota composition in proctological patients presenting with symptoms of proctitis.16doi 10.560401.3001.0010.1083the objective of this study was to assess the impact of the pro- biotic lactobacillus rhamnosus pl1 strain on the clinical pres- entation and composition of intestinal microbiota in patients with symptoms of proctitis in the course of hemorrhoidal dis- ease and diverticulosis.material and methodpatientsincluded in the analysis were a total of 24 patients including 17 patients with hemorrhoidal disease and 7 patients with divertic- ulosis treated at the outpatient clinic of the department of gen- eral oncological and gastrointestinal surgery with no complete clinical improvement following the treatment of the underlying disease.

an increase in the total counts of the bacteria of lactobacillus genus particularly l. rhamnosus pl1 strain was observed regardless of the underlying disease.conclusion the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus pl1 strain appears to be useful in restoring appropriate ratios of bacterial populations in patients presenting with symptoms of proctitis in the course of the treatment of certain diseases of the low- er gastrointestinal tract.keywordshemorrhoidal disease diverticulosis probiotics gut microbiota lactobacillus rhamnosus pl1introductionin proctological practice one may encounter a significant number of patients who suffer from recurrent proctitis and symptoms associ- ated therewith despite having undergone the frequently successful treatment for the underlying disease of the lower gastrointestinal tract hemorrhoidal disease anal fissure perianal fistula diverticulosis.

the changes varied depending on the underlying disease and disturbances caused by that disease in the bacterial composition of intestinal microflora.in the course of hemorrhoidal disease occasional occurrence of blood in the rectal lumen is sufficient to disturb the microbiotic composition of the distal segment of the large intestine.

intensity of clinical symptoms in patients with hemorrhoidal disease mean - semterobacteriaceae p0.0001 including e. coli p00001 and cocci of genus enterococcus p0.0001 figure 3a.in patients with diverticulosis the quantitative ratio between aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts differed significantly from those ob- served in patients with hemorrhoidal disease.

thus one may assume that the increased counts of e. faecalis within the intesti- nal lumen and walls in the course of advanced inflammation con- tribute to the persistence of this process 14.extension of the standard treatment by additional supplementation using a probiotic product containing the lactobacillus rhamnosuspl1 strain significantly improved the clinical parameters of patients with the hemorrhoidal disease as well as patients with diverticulosis.the effect exerted by lactobacillus on colonocytes may be man- ifold but it consists mainly in stimulation of mucus production thus improving the function of the intestinal barrier 15. the in- tegrity of the intestinal barrier may be improved by lactobacillus strains also by means of increasing the mucosal levels of b-defen- sin 2 16. in addition bacteria of genus lactobacillus were shown to be capable of inhibiting cytokine-induced apoptosis of intesti- nal wall cells 17. one may also assume that the bacteria of genus lactobacillus thanks to their synthesis of numerous antibacterial agents such as bacteriocins lactic acid acetic acid of pyroglutamic acid may actively reduce the populations of gram-negative bacilli as observed in patients with hemorrhoidal disease as early as after 3 weeks of supplementation.in patients with diverticulosis a decrease in the counts of cocci of genus enterococcus was observed with simultaneous increase in the number of patients successfully colonized with the bacte- ria of genus lactobacillus which may be indicative of the higherreferencesduncan s.h.

as early as after 3 weeks of supplementation with the probiotic l. rhamnosus pl1 strain significant qualitative and quantitative changes were observed in the composition of intestinal microbiota the changes differed depending on the underlying disease.

qualified for the study werepatients with grade ii and iii hemorrhoidal disease afterconservative andor surgical treatment and presenting with symptoms of rectal mucositis in anoscopic examination with the history of earlier standardized 8-week conservative treatment ointments and suppositories improvement in follow-up anoscopic examination and persisting complaints andpatients with endoscopically confirmed diverticulosiscurrently without features of acute diverticulitis who had completed the standard treatment with rifaximin for 6 months 2x2 tablets for 7 days repeated every 1 month and nonetheless presented with persistent features of proctitis in anoscopic examination and symptoms within the lower gastrointestinal tract.all patients were included in the study after at least 4 weeks of washout with regard to all antibiotic medications or probiotic products.the observation time in this prospective self-controlled study was 12 weeks.

additional attention was paid to the quantitative changes observed between stool samples collected at visits v1 and v2 with reference to the total count of lactobacil- lus genus particularly of the probiotic l. rhamnosus pl1 strain.resultsthe study group of 24 patients 13 women and 11 men included 17 patients with hemorrhoidal disease and 7 patient with diver-fig.

baseline constipation was reported by 58.33 1424 of patients after 3 weeks the percentage dropped to 12.5 324 and after 12 weeks from the start of the treatment 3 weeks after discontinuation of the probiotic product the problem was not reported by any of the patients p0.0001.in a detailed analysis of the group of 17 patients with hemorrho- idal disease particular differences were observed in the intensi- ty of flatulence p0.005 and abdominal discomfort p0002 which were significantly reduced.

a significant reduction in the population of aerobic bacteria p0.0001 was observed in patients with hem- orrhoidal disease while the strictly anaerobic bacterial counts re- mained unchanged figure 2a.

this increase was due to the increase in the population of gram-negative bacilli of genus entero- bacteriaceae p0.0001 but not to the increase in the population of cocci of the family enterococcus since the latter also classified as aer- obic bacteria showed a decreasing trend at v2 p0.0001 figure 3b.the reduction in the total population of fecal cocci of the family enterococcus as observed at the second visit v2 may be directly associated with the improvement of clinical parameters observed as early as after 3 weeks of probiotic treatment table 4.no bacteria of genus lactobacillus were found in the baseline stool sample ss1 in 7 out of 17 patients 41.18 treated for hemorrhoidal disease.

after 3 weeks of oral supplementation bacteria of this genus were found in 15 out of 17 patients 88.24 table 5. colonization by l. rhamnosus pl1 strain was confirmed in 15 out of 17 patients treated for hemorrhoidal disease which amounts to colonization efficacy rate of 88.24 figure 4.in case of patients treated for diverticulosis colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with the l.rhamnosus pl1 strain after 3 weeks of supplementation was confirmed in 4 cases 57 of patients.

with regard to the impact of the l. rhamnosus pl1 strain on the increase on the total counts of the bacteria of genus lactobacillus it was even more evident than in patients with hemorrhoidal disease table 6. namely only 1 in 7 patients included in the study presented with lactobacillus colonization at v1 14  while the number of patients with lactobacillus colonization at v2 increased to 6 out of 7 patients 86.discussionimprovement in the intensity of clinical symptoms was observed in the during the study in the entire patient population.

the change in clinical presentation was depend- ent on the underlying disease.
