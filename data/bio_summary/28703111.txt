disturbed composition of gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis or is a consequence of both intestinal inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome diverticulosis celiac disease as well as extraintestinal allergies asthma metabolic syndrome cardiovascular diseases systemic disorders 2 and cancers.Appreciating the value of the proper composition of gut microflo- ra the authors made an attempt at verification whether and how supplementation using a single probiotic bacterial strain affect- ed the clinical presentation of the disease and the gut microbiota composition in proctological patients presenting with symptoms of proctitis.16DOI 10.560401.3001.0010.1083The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the pro- biotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus PL1 strain on the clinical pres- entation and composition of intestinal microbiota in patients with symptoms of proctitis in the course of hemorrhoidal dis- ease and diverticulosis.MATERIAL AND METHODPatientsIncluded in the analysis were a total of 24 patients including 17 patients with hemorrhoidal disease and 7 patients with divertic- ulosis treated at the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Gen- eral Oncological and Gastrointestinal Surgery with no complete clinical improvement following the treatment of the underlying disease.

An increase in the total counts of the bacteria of Lactobacillus genus particularly L. rhamnosus PL1 strain was observed regardless of the underlying disease.Conclusion the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus PL1 strain appears to be useful in restoring appropriate ratios of bacterial populations in patients presenting with symptoms of proctitis in the course of the treatment of certain diseases of the low- er gastrointestinal tract.KEYWORDShemorrhoidal disease diverticulosis probiotics gut microbiota Lactobacillus rhamnosus PL1INTRODUCTIONIn proctological practice one may encounter a significant number of patients who suffer from recurrent proctitis and symptoms associ- ated therewith despite having undergone the frequently successful treatment for the underlying disease of the lower gastrointestinal tract hemorrhoidal disease anal fissure perianal fistula diverticulosis.

The changes varied depending on the underlying disease and disturbances caused by that disease in the bacterial composition of intestinal microflora.In the course of hemorrhoidal disease occasional occurrence of blood in the rectal lumen is sufficient to disturb the microbiotic composition of the distal segment of the large intestine.

Intensity of clinical symptoms in patients with hemorrhoidal disease mean - SEMterobacteriaceae p0.0001 including E. coli p00001 and cocci of genus Enterococcus p0.0001 Figure 3A.In patients with diverticulosis the quantitative ratio between aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts differed significantly from those ob- served in patients with hemorrhoidal disease.

As early as after 3 weeks of supplementation with the probiotic L. rhamnosus PL1 strain significant qualitative and quantitative changes were observed in the composition of intestinal microbiota the changes differed depending on the underlying disease.

Qualified for the study werePatients with grade II and III hemorrhoidal disease afterconservative andor surgical treatment and presenting with symptoms of rectal mucositis in anoscopic examination with the history of earlier standardized 8-week conservative treatment ointments and suppositories improvement in follow-up anoscopic examination and persisting complaints andPatients with endoscopically confirmed diverticulosiscurrently without features of acute diverticulitis who had completed the standard treatment with rifaximin for 6 months 2x2 tablets for 7 days repeated every 1 month and nonetheless presented with persistent features of proctitis in anoscopic examination and symptoms within the lower gastrointestinal tract.All patients were included in the study after at least 4 weeks of washout with regard to all antibiotic medications or probiotic products.The observation time in this prospective self-controlled study was 12 weeks.

Additional attention was paid to the quantitative changes observed between stool samples collected at visits V1 and V2 with reference to the total count of Lactobacil- lus genus particularly of the probiotic L. rhamnosus PL1 strain.RESULTSThe study group of 24 patients 13 women and 11 men included 17 patients with hemorrhoidal disease and 7 patient with diver-Fig.

Baseline constipation was reported by 58.33 1424 of patients after 3 weeks the percentage dropped to 12.5 324 and after 12 weeks from the start of the treatment 3 weeks after discontinuation of the probiotic product the problem was not reported by any of the patients p0.0001.In a detailed analysis of the group of 17 patients with hemorrho- idal disease particular differences were observed in the intensi- ty of flatulence p0.005 and abdominal discomfort p0002 which were significantly reduced.

A significant reduction in the population of aerobic bacteria p0.0001 was observed in patients with hem- orrhoidal disease while the strictly anaerobic bacterial counts re- mained unchanged Figure 2A.
