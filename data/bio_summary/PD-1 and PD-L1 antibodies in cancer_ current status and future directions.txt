The data from this initial phase III trial led to the FDA breakthrough status and subse- quent approval of pembrolizumab in October 2014 for patients with advanced melanoma.Combination studies with the CTLA-4 blocking anti-body ipilimumab and nivolumab were pursued in the Checkmate-004 phase I Checkmate-069 randomized phase II and Checkmate-067 randomized phase III stud- ies -.

These data led to Checkmate-026 a phase III randomized study testing single-agent nivolumab every 2 weeks versus the investigator's choice chemother- apy as first-line treatment in 541 patients with advanced PD-L1 expressing defined as 5 PD-L1 expression NSCLC.

These include the Checkmate-275 phase II study of nivolumab in 270 previ- ously treated patients which demonstrated a 19.6 ORR with higher response rates observed in PD-L1 overexpress- ing patients 28 ORR in 5 tumor cell PD-L1 expres- sion .

Abstract 2980Ratcliffe MJSA Midha A Barker C Scorer P Walker J 2016 A comparative study of PD-L1 diagnostic assays and the clas- sification of patients as PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative.

The ligands for the PD-1 receptor are PD-L1 and PD-L2 which are molecules found on antigen-present- ing cells and in the case of PD-L1 it is often expressed on epithelial and other types of tumor cells resulting in an inhibitory interaction within the tumor microenvironment.

The results of the two phase III studies led to the approval of nivolumab for first-line or previously treated melanoma.The toxicity tolerability and clinical efficacy of MK-3475 now pembrolizumab Keytruda Merck Inc Kenilworth NJ an IgG4 fully humanized antibody was evaluated in the large Keynote-001 phase III study that included 611 melanoma patients .

The absolute PD-L1 expression level in that study was associated with better outcome with higherlevels conferring better survival providing further evidence that PD-L1 expression falls along a continuum and is asso- ciated with response and improved outcomes with PD-1 targeted treatment.

Rapid and durable responses coupled with a highly favorable safety profile in the phase Ia study led to the multinational phase II IMVigor210trial in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that enrolled two cohorts 119 cisplatin-ineligible patients treat- ment naive in the metastatic setting Cohort 1 and 310 patients previously treated with platinum-based chemo- therapy Cohort 2.

The Ventana SP142 assay for testing PD-L1 expression on infiltrating immune cells is approved for use as a companion diagnos- tic however it is not required for atezolizumab use since absence of PD-L1 expression does not preclude response to treatment.Similar studies of PD-1 antibodies in previously treatedpatients have since been reported.
