the dietary treatment resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of predicted genes involved in butyrate synthesis especially genes encoding butyryl-coa transferase ec 2.8.3.8 and butyrate kinase ec 2.7.2.7 and an associated significant increase in fecal butyrate levels likely deriving from lactate catabolism one of the primary pathways for butyrate production by gut bacteria .
