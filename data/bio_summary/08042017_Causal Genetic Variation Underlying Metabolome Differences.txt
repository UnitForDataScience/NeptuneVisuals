Our genetic data reveal significant natural variation in urea cycle metabo- lism between strains from different ecological niches.Table 1 Principal components for urea cyclePC principal component Orn ornithine Cit citrulline Gln glutamine Glu glutamate Arg arginine H2 broad-sense heritability.Table 2 mQTL for urea cycle principal componentsPC principal component.Our initial mQTL analysis assumed that each metabolite was independent butmetabolite abundances in the urea cycle are intrinsically linked to one another.

This suggests that the mQTL with the strongest genetic signal are specific to the urea cycle.Causal variation in two genes underlies natural variation in urea cycle metabolitesOur pathway-level analysis of metabolite abundances nar- rowed mQTL and revealed promising candidate genes.

We used an untargeted mass spectrometry method to identify dozens of metabolite Quantitative Trait Loci mQTL genomic regions containing genetic variation that control differences in metabolite levels between individuals.

We conclude that and are novel mQTGs metabolite Quantitative Trait Genes.Predicting phenotype from genotype a novel phenotype deduced from variation in the urea cycleIn principle genetic variation in metabolism can predict new phenotypes.

Our results demonstrate that several segregating genetic variants impact urea cycle metabolism and that our rapid untargeted method identified mQTL that affect an important biochemical pathway.Because segregating variation in the recombinant progeny influenced metabolites in the urea cycle we predicted that the parental strains would harbor differences in urea cycle metab- olism.

We mapped variation in urea cycle metab- olites to genetic variation in specific genes known to regulate amino acid biosynthesis Dubois and Messenguy 1985 Sophianopoloulou and Diallinas 2005.

We detected a genetically complex network of mQTL with sev- eral mQTL influencing the same metabolite and several metabolites with multiple mQTL.

Understanding how genetic variation in specific genes affects metabolic phenotypes is an important step to- ward the goal of predicting phenotype from genetic variation.

However few investigators have attempted to map genetic variation using untargeted mass spectrometry which can lead to the discovery of both unknown metabolic and genetic variation Lewis et al.
