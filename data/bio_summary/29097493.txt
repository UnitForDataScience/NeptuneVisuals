Metagenomic studies revealed functional differences in gut bacteria in R including enrichment of anabolic pathways.Immune profiling suggested enhanced systemic and anti-tumor immunity in responding patients with a favorable gut microbiome as well as in germ-free mice receiving fecal transplants from responding patients.

Based on these data we examined the diversity of the oral and gut microbiomes in eligible patients on anti-PD1 therapy and found that alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was significantly higher in R n30 compared to NR n13 using several indices p0.01 Fig.

S16.Next we sought to gain insight into the mechanism through which the gut microbiome may influence response to anti-PD-1 therapy and first conducted functional genomic profiling of gut microbiome samples via metagenomic WGS sequencing n25 in R n14 vs NR n11.

Pairwise comparisons using Spearman rank correlations were then performed between specific bacterial taxa enriched in the gut microbiome of R and NR and immune markers in the tumor microenvironment demonstrating a statistically significant positive correlation between the CD8 T cell infiltrate in the tumor and abundance of the FaecalibacteriumGopalakrishnan et al.Page 5genus the Ruminococcaceae family and the Clostridiales order in the gut and a non- significant but negative correlation with Bacteroidales Fig.

To test this we first compared an enrichment of operational taxonomic units OTUs in R versus NR demonstrating that distinct sets of rare low abundance OTUs were associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy with enrichment of Clostridiales in R and Bacteroidales in NR in the gut microbiome p0.01 Fig.
