together these data have important implications for the treatment of melanoma patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors.tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma and other cancers using immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated antigen ctla-4 and the programmed death 1 pd-1 protein however responses to these therapies are often heterogeneous and not durable 1-3. it has recently emerged that factors beyond tumor genomics influence cancer development and therapeutic responses 4-7 including host factors such as the gastrointestinal gut microbiome 8-10. a number of studies have shown that the gut microbiome may influence anti-tumor immune responses via innate and adaptive immunity 11 12 and that therapeutic responses may be improved via its modulation 13 14 however this has not been extensively studied in cancer patients.to better understand the role of the microbiome in response to immune checkpoint blockade we prospectively collected microbiome samples from patients with metastatic melanoma starting treatment with anti-pd-1 therapy n112 patients fig.

loss of microbial diversity dysbiosis is associated with chronic health conditions 26-28 and cancer 8-10 and is also associated with poor outcomes to certain forms of cancer therapy including allogeneic stem cell transplant 29. based on these data we examined the diversity of the oral and gut microbiomes in eligible patients on anti-pd1 therapy and found that alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was significantly higher in r n30 compared to nr n13 using several indices p0.01 fig.

analysis of systemic immune responses via flow cytometry and cytokine assays revealed that patients with a high abundance of clostridiales ruminococcaceae or faecalibacterium in the gut had higher levels of effector cd4 and cd8 t cells in the systemic circulation with a preserved cytokine response to anti-pd-1 therapy whereas patients with a higher abundance of bacteroidales in the gut microbiome had higher levels of regulatory t cells treg and myeloid derived suppressor cells mdsc in the systemic circulation with a blunted cytokine response fig.

metagenomic studies revealed functional differences in gut bacteria in r including enrichment of anabolic pathways.immune profiling suggested enhanced systemic and anti-tumor immunity in responding patients with a favorable gut microbiome as well as in germ-free mice receiving fecal transplants from responding patients.

s18 18 37. pairwise comparisons using spearman rank correlations were then performed between specific bacterial taxa enriched in the gut microbiome of r and nr and immune markers in the tumor microenvironment demonstrating a statistically significant positive correlation between the cd8 t cell infiltrate in the tumor and abundance of the faecalibacteriumgopalakrishnan et al.page 5genus the ruminococcaceae family and the clostridiales order in the gut and a non- significant but negative correlation with bacteroidales fig.

to test this we first compared an enrichment of operational taxonomic units otus in r versus nr demonstrating that distinct sets of rare low abundance otus were associated with response to anti-pd-1 therapy with enrichment of clostridiales in r and bacteroidales in nr in the gut microbiome p0.01 fig.

to better understand the influence of compositional differences in the gut microbiome on antigen processing and presentation within the tumor microenvironment we next performed multiplex ihc targeting the myeloid compartment 38. in these studies patients with a high abundance of faecalibacterium in the gut microbiome had a higher density of immune cells and markers of antigen processing and presentation compared to those with a high abundance of bacteroidales fig.
