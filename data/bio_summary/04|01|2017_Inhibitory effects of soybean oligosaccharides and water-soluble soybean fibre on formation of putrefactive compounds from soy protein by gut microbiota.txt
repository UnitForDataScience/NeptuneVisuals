for example there are reports about their immune activity anti-inflammation activity  corresponding author.e-mail address t. kuda.and improvement of clinical indices in type 2 diabetes how- ever it was shown that the indole content in the gut content of wistar rats fed soy protein was greater than that in rats fed milk casein soy protein is rich in tryptophan and tryptophan is con- verted to indoles by the microbiota.soybean contains water-soluble dietary fibre composed of galactose arabinose galacturonic acid xylose fructose and rham- nose in oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose not only the oligosaccharides but also the dietary fibre can be fermented by gut microbiota we reported that fermentable dietary fibres in brown algae alginic acid and laminaran both vis- cous and not viscous could inhibit the putrefactive compounds generated by the gut microbiota by increasing the organic acids therefore it is thought that the fermentable carbohydrates in soybeans affect putrefactive compounds production from soy- protein in the gut when whole soybeans were administered.in this study the inhibitory effects of raffinose stachyose and water-soluble dietary fibre from soybeans on the putrefactive com- pound production by human faecal microbiota in a broth containing soy-protein were examined.

some groups of the resi- dential bacteria some groups prevent inflammation and stimulate immune responses on the other hand protein residues in gut can be converted to putrefactive compounds such as ammonia amines phenols and indoles by a part of microbiota these putrefactive compounds are considered as putative tumour factors various factors such as age stress climate pathogens drugs and also diet affect the composition of gut microbiota further- more composition of diet and gut microbiota are dependent on the geographical location and cultural background soybeans are important protein source in the world.

1. in the rats fed sfb lactic acid and total organic acid contents were high c. compared to sp-2 sfb suppressed the caecal indole content by about 50 d. these results agree with the in vitro results shown in dgge analysis of caecal microbiotathe total caecal bacterial direct counts in rats fed the sp-1 sfl sp-2 or sfb diet were 10.45 10.54 10.08 and 10.25 log cellsg respectively.

we had previously reported that the caecal indole level in rats fed a far east asian modelled-diet containing soy protein was higher than that in rats fed a casein and beef tallow-rich diet scb diet in contrast we found no significant change in the indole content between rats fed far east asian marine diet rich in soy- bean fishmeal and a brown algae 'wakame' undaria pinnatifida and those fed the scb diet.

caecal microbial fermentation products and microbiota in rats fed 20 soy protein sp-1 and whole soybean flour sfl protein content was 20 diets were determined.

further study of these activities and expression of the enzymes involved in generating putrefactive compounds in gut microbiota is needed.various species of gut microbiota particularly those in bac- teroides sp.

therefore the relationships among the polysaccharide intake gut microbiota and their metabolites and host cells partic- ularly in gut epithelial cells and immune related cells in mucosaand submucosa need to be examined in future studies.conclusionin this study we showed that the oligosaccharides and water- soluble dietary fibre in soybeans reduced the in vitro formation of ammonia indole and phenol by human faecal microbiota.

our findings indicated that fermentable polysaccharides in soybeans have inhibitory effects on the formation of putrefactive compounds generated from soy protein by the microbiota.c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.introductionthe human gut large intestine contains 13-14 log bacteria cells that belong to about 1000 species or strains they plays an important role in host health it is regarded that gut microbiota have beneficial and also harmful effects.

a band of prevotella was shown in all groups.diversity of the microbiota analysed by pyrosequencingin the pyrosequencing analysis the average of total reads of each sample were 3874 3505 2772 and 3635 in rats fed sp-1 sfl sp- 2 or sfb diet respectively while the shannon indexes were 7.07 6.70 5.89 and 5.42 respectively.as shown in the data obtained from pyrosequencing was used to carry out principle coordinate analysis pcoa.

after acclimation with ain-76 based diet for 7 days the animals were divided into two groups n  6 and provided an experimental diet containing 20 ww of soy-protein sp-1 in or 41.5ww of soybean flour sfl diet for 14 days.in the case of exp.

however sfl and sfb did not lead to a reduction in the phenol content though tyrosine phenol lyase may be affected by the ph and inhibited by some fermentable dietary fibres this suggests that changing the composition of microbiota affected the enzymatic activities.
