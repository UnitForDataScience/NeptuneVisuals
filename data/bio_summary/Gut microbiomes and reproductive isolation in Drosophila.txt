Manipulation of the diet and hence the gut microbiome was reported to result in immediate assorta- tive mating by diet which could be eliminated by reducing gut microbes using antibiotics and recreated by adding back Lactoba- cillus plantarum.

Despite observing replicable differences in the gut microbiomes of flies maintained on different diets we found no evidence for diet-associated RI for any role of gut bacteria or for L. plantarum specifically.

The results suggest that there is no general role for gut bacteria in driving the evolution of RI in this species and resolve an evolutionary riddle.ecological adaptation  diet  holobiome  gut microflora  assortative matinghe experimental study of key elements of incipient re- productive isolation RI in the laboratory has provided im- portant insights into the underlying evolutionary processes involved 1 2.

The proposed mecha- nism was via differential effects of gut bacteria on cuticular hy- drocarbons that affect attractiveness 16 18-20.These results stimulated intense interest in the wider role of the gut microbiome in mate choice and potentially speciation 21-24.

Hence the evolutionary significance of this type of association between gut bacteria and host is unclear 26 34 35.These reasons may explain the lack of consistency in tests that have investigated a general role for gut bacteria in mating as- sociations and mate choice in D. melanogaster 16 18 36-38.

We first described the gut microbiomes on the basis that a precondition for assortative mating mediated by diet andor gut microbiota is that the microbiomes should be at least partially distinct between flies maintained on different diets.

The results revealed that although there were replicated differences in the gut microbiomes in flies maintained on the different diets there was no evidence for assortative mating associated with diet with gut bacteria or with L. plantarum in particular.Results and DiscussionComposition of the Gut Microbiomes of CMY and Starch Flies.

16 and 17 and provide no evi- dence of assortative mating by diet or that mating preference is associated with gut microbiota.12768  Leftwich et al.Our results suggest that any effects of gut microbes in mate choice or assortative mating in this species are highly variable and represent proximate effects or epiphenomena derived from an as-yet un- identified origin.

To rule out the effects of variation in gut microbiome composition we also tested the effect of gut microbiome removal andL.

More recently a direct role for the gut microbiome in determining this type of RI in Drosophila mel- anogaster has been proposed.
