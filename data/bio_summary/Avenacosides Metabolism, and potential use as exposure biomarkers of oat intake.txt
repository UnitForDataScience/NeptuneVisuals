This study investigates the potential of oat unique components Avenacoside-B AVE-B and -A AVE-A as exposure biomarkers of oat intake.Methods and results An in vivo study performed in mice and an in vitro batch fecal fermen- tation study were used to investigate the potential metabolic routes of AVE-B and -A. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited in the human urinary pharmacokinetic study each partici- pant received a single dose of oat bran as breakfast 48 h urine samples were collected at baseline and after treatment period and AVE-B and -A were quantified by LC-MSMS.

Our recent study revealed that AVE-B and -A present high concentrations in oat bran OB products with total content of AVE-B and -A vary from 304 to 443.0 mgkg 26.

The LODs were 0.015 and0.003 nM for AVE-B and -A respectively and the LOQs were0.20 and 0.05 nM for AVE-B and -A respectively.

Furthermore the pharmacokinetic study of AVE-B and -A showed that AVE-B and -A have similar pharmacokinetic pa- rameters and they may be used as potential biomarkers to precisely evaluate the intake of oats and oats-related prod- ucts in epidemiologic studies.

Deglycosylation metabolic route was identified as the major metabolic path for AVE-B and -A. Urinary AVE-B and -A concentrations increased rapidly after oat ingestion reached their maximum excre- tion rates ERmax fairly simultaneously within 5 h then decreased gradually.

And the mean eliminate half-lives T12 for AVE-B and -A were determined as 6.22 and 4.55 h respectively.

Conclusion Oat AVE-B and -A have great potential to be used as specific exposure biomarkers to reflect oat intake.KeywordsAvenacosides  Exposure biomarkers  Gut microbiota  Metabolism  Oat intakeAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived February 23 2017Revised April 10 2017Accepted April 24 2017IntroductionEpidemiologic studies have emphasized that increased con- sumption of whole grain WG food is associated with reduced risk of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular dis- ease certain types of cancer and type 2 diabetes 1-4.

AVE-C -B and -A with purity 95 were isolated from OB in our lab 26.

AVE-B and -A were dissolved in DMSO and ad- ministered to mice by oral gavage 200 mgkg respectively.

For quantifying the concentrations of AVE- B and -A in human urine the samples were prepared us- ing an automated SPE system from Gilson Inc. GX-274 ASPEC Gilson Middleton WI USA.
