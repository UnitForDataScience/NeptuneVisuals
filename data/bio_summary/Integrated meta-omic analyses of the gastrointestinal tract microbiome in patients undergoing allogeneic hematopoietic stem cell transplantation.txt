In E. coli 20 of the 31 ARGs that were found in both sam- ples exhibited higher levels of expression in the post- treatment sample while in E. faecium 18 out of 21 ARGs showed higher expression post-HSCT.Although patient A07 was only treated with antibiotics until day 18  D ARG expression was in general higher in the post-treatment sample both in the whole sample  B as well as in specific populations  C.Genomic characterization of a blood culture E. coli isolate and comparison to GIT populations.

In the genome of the E. coli isolate the same ARGs as in the pre- and post-treatment GIT E. coli could be identified with 4 additional ARGs compared with the post-treatment GIT E. coli.DISCUSSIONShort-term structural changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Also in accord with those results most of the clusters were only found in the pretreatment sample representation of both samples within a single plot  C.Given the potential role of opportunistic pathogens in aGvHD we were specifically interested in 2 population-level reconstructed genomes that were found in both samples and whose genomes could be recovered with high completeness namely E. coli andE.

coli indicated that all the E. coli genomes from patient A07 the isolate and the genomes from the GIT MG were more closely related to each other than to the reference genomes Supplementary Fig.

Moreover ARG expression was higher in both samples from patient A07 compared with ARG expression in RHMs  B.We were then interested in whether higher numbers of ARGs could also be detected in the specific populations of E. coli and E. faecium.

B Histogram of the ratios of metatranscriptomic MT to metagenomic MG depths of coverage of ARGs in the pretreatment and post-treatment samples and in the untreated RHMs.C Histograms of the ratios of MT to MG depths of coverage of ARGs in population-level genomes of Escher- ichia coli and of Enterococcus faecium in pretreatment and post-treatment samples.

Antibiotic resistance genes identified in population-level genomes of GIT E. coli from patient A07Observed nucleotide variant frequencies  G andH and patterns of variant distributions  E and F indicated that the treatment may have constituted a ge- netic bottleneck for E. faecium culminating in the observed lower genetic diversity.

While the E. coli population composed of different strains remained relatively unaffected the E. faecium population mainly represented by a single strain underwent a selective sweep in response to the antibiotic treatment with selec- tion of a specific genotype expressing ARGs.Coupled metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of antibiotic resistance genes in pre- and post- treatment samples from patient A07.

The average MG depths of coverage indicated a decreased population size of E. coli after allo-HSCT in sample A07-3  A while that of E. faecium remained rather constant  C. To reveal possible selective ''sweeps'' in the populations of interest caused by antibiotics we performed a gene-wise protein sequence comparison of the different population-level genomes.

To assess the relationships between different E. coli genomes PanPhlAn and the provided database including 118 E. coli reference strains was applied.
