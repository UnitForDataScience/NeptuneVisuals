this encompasses the determination of the microbial composition by the human gut chip hugchip a dna phylogenetic microarray detecting 16s bacterial sequences20 and its metabolic behavior by measuring the fermentative atmospheric gases the production of short chain fatty acids scfas and by determining a high resolution metabolite fingerprint.loose stool corresponding more frequently to the prevotella entero- type4 and with more abundant bacteroides spp.3this increase of transit time is also one of the gastrointestinal modifications encountered in elderly people either living in a com- munity or in institutions56 and for whom human gut microbiota variations have been associated.7-10 to address the real part of the transit time influence drugs have been administered to cohorts to change the patient transit time.1112 these studies reported a negative correlation between the increase of transit time and fecal microbial biomass.

this was realized by adjusting media supply rates with no other parameters changes in the entry of the in vitro system.this retention time change induced modifications to the recon- stituted gut microbiota such as a reduction of biomass which is in line with in vivo modifications reported with a medication-induced reduction of transit time in humans.11 however in vivo data on the effect of constipation and slow transit time in the general population and on their gut microbiota are sparse.3 moreover it is difficult to differentiate the effects due to transit time from other factors such as diet.

furthermore the increase of transit time positively corre- lated with the increase of methanogens of breath methane concen- trations and ph while being inversely correlated to the proportion of sulfate reducing bacteria and the concentration of short chain fatty acid scfa.12in vitro systems have been developed and used to study the hu- man gut13 overcoming ethical questions.14 in previous experiments conducted by macfarlane and collaborators15 an in vitro system was used to simulate the passage from an average colon transit 66.7 hours to a quick colon transit 27.1 hours by a change of retention time.

the arrows indicate the metabolic trajectory from the proximal part to the distal one at the 2 transit times.the first component x-axis accounting for about 38 of the dif- ferences between reactors discriminates all 3 compartments under a normal transit time p48 t48 and d48 while little differences are observed according to this component for the slow transit time.

the transit time is one of the factors that explain some of the modifications seen in the gut microbiota of the elderly as well as patients with slow transit time.j neurogastroenterol motil 201723124-134key wordsaging colon constipation gut microbiome microbiological techniques124c 2017 the korean society of neurogastroenterology and motilityj neurogastroenterol motil vol.

it also enables microbiota differentiations between the compartments from a com- mon fecal bacterial repertoire and leads to similar microbial signa- tures between the distal compartment and the fecal inoculum.18 in the present study we increased the retention time of media in each compartment in order to simulate an increase of transit time from a normal intestinal transit time of 48 hours to a slow one of 96 hours.

last no changes in bacteroidaceae were observed in any reactors agreeing with the recent finding that these bacterial species were associated with loose stool.3 therefore in vitro results obtained in this study provide strong elements that transit time seems a major driven force of the gut microbiota composition.it also provides clues about the prevalence and abundance of methanogenic archaea and among them methanobrevibacter smithii the most important one is increased in elderly people.43-45 they are described as being correlated with an increase of transit time and inversely correlated to sulfate reducing bacteria.12 here the initial stool from a healthy adult was chosen without methano- gens which was confirmed by the absence of ch4 in the gas pro- duced by any reactor.

thus we tested the metabolic and compositional changes of a human gut microbiota induced by an increased transit time simulated in vitro.methodsthe in vitro system environmental control system for intestinal microbiota was used to simulate the environmental conditions of 3 different anatomical parts of the human colon in a continuous process.

recently the colonic transit rate evaluated through stool consistency categorized by the bristol stool scale has been strongly associated with gut microbiota composition3 withafigure 1. the 3-stage environmental control system for intestinal microbiota 3s-ecsim and overall design of the experiment.

this would also contribute to determining to what extent the reduced transit time could contribute to the distinctive gut microbiota of elderly people.materials and methodsthree-stage environmental control system for intestinal microbiota procedurethe fecal aliquot was obtained from a healthy female volunteer 29 years old without recent treatment with antibiotics and who was not a breath methane-producer.

here we hypothesized that an increase of transit time which is frequently as- sociated with elderly people could be one of those factors.56 indeed in baboons aging leads to an abnormal neuronal stimulation from the myenteric plexus and impairments in the cholinergic mecha- nism therefore affecting the smooth muscle colonic contractile re- sponse.34 we observed that the increase of retention time induced a decrease of total bacteria in the compartments of the system simulat- ing the transversal and distal colon data not shown which is also frequently associated with the gut microbiota of elderly people.113536 furthermore increasing the retention time decreased the gut mi- crobiota diversity in the transversal and distal compartment of thesystem comparably to the fecal microbiota of elderly people.8935-37 consequently an important metabolic shift mainly at a quantitative level was observed the proximal colon simulating reactor being the most affected.the important metabolic shift in the proximal part together with the increase of total scfa when retention time increases sug- gests an increase of carbohydrate fermentation in this compartment as previously reported.15 this has several consequences first carbo- hydrate availability become lower in the next compartments result- ing in increased putrefaction by specialized groups and second this induces a decrease in microbial diversity this is also confirmed by an increase of concentrations of longer and branched fatty acids isovalerate and isobutyrate typical of protein fermentation and with the limited metabolic activity in the compartments simulating the transversal and distal colon.clostridium cl.

the gut microbiota of elderly people is studied much more and more data are available.7-1030 aging is frequently associated with fecal microbiota modifications which can be explained by many dif- ferent factors.731 diet is a key factor31 and aging has been associated to a decrease sensitivity of taste and smell3233 so these changes could lead to the consumption of a restricted nutritionally imbalanced diet and in fine the modification of the gut microbiota.
