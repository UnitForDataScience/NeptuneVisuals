Moreover recent study on urinary microbiota has also detected Chitinophagaceae both in mid-stream urine and vaginal fluid samples.In conclusion we report that although vaginal microbiota at labor resembled microbiota during pregnancy bacteria associated with CST IV were significantly overrepresented.

However vaginal microbiota may undergo rapid changesand we lack large studies of vaginal microbiota during labor.

Since prenatal hormonal changes might contribute to the differences in the microbiota we believe that this can indicate that vaginal microbiota changes shortly before labor onset and then takes long time to be recovered back to its non-pregnant state.

However only a few small studies have investigated the composition of vaginal microbiota during labor.

Although individuals' vaginal microbiota was stable overtime several bacterial families which are characteristic of mixed community state type CST IV were overrepresented in vaginal swabs sampled at labor.

Among the women who switched their vaginal microbiota from one CST to another approximately half shifted towards CST IV.

Probiotic consumption did not alter vaginal microbiota.Vaginal microbiota of women can generally be separated into five vaginal bacterial community state types CSTs that seem to be dependent on ethnic and biogeographical background.

Whilst CST IV can be found in healthy women it is often linked to high Nugent scores and bacterial vaginosis which in turn is associated with increased risk of preterm birth and contraction of sexually transmit- ted infections.The vaginal microbiota plays a major role in initial colonization of the infant gut.

Several large cohort studies have described vaginal microbiota during pregnancy.
