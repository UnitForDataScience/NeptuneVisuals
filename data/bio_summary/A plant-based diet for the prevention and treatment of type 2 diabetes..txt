Dietary modification is an integral part of the lifestyle recommendations for persons with diabetes it is worth noting that while the vegan diet required greater changes in macronutrient intake than the ADA-guided diet there was no difference in acceptability or adherence to the diets55 a finding that has also been demonstrated in other trials.5657 While this may be surprising given the potential degree of change required to adopt a vegan diet the authors hypothesized that not limiting portion sizes not counting calories or carbohydrates and experiencing of a variety of new flavors in the vegan diet likely offset any hardship im- posed by restricting animal products or added oils.55High-carbohydrate low-fat predominantly vegetariandiets are often associated with weight loss making it diffi- cult to ascertain what proportion of the improvement in glycemic control is due to weight loss versus dietary changes.

These results argue for the efficacy of low-fat plant-based diets which are naturally high in carbohydrates and fiber in reversing the insulin resistance that is at the root of type 2 diabetes-- though it remains unclear what component of a plant-based diet is most effective the high carbohydrate and fiber con- tent the low fat and low-animal protein content or both.A 2014 review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials of vegetarian diets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes found a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c of -0.39 points compared to control diets.58 This effect is approxi- mately half of that seen with the addition of the first-line oral hypoglycemic agent metformin which in a recent me- ta-analysis was reported to reduce hemoglobin A1c by 0.9 points.59 A more recent randomized controlled trial con- ducted in Korea compared a brown-rice-based vegan diet with a conventional diabetic diet in patients ages 30-70 years with type 2 diabetes.60 Participants assigned to the vegan diet were asked to eat brown rice favor low-glycemic index foods e.g.

However a plant-based diet has been shown to be similarly acceptable to an ADA diet among people with diabetes55 plant-based diets have also been found to be highly acceptable in other medical contexts.144-146 Common questions about specific macro- and micronutrients in plant-based diets have been addressed else- where.141143147148 Patients who adopt a plant-based diet can experience decreases in blood sugar and blood pressure rela- tively quickly after changing their diet especially if they are taking medications for these conditions.

One study demonstrated a remarkable resolution of burning neuropathy in 81 of participants during a 25-day residential lifestyle program in which plant- based meals were provided including a sustained response in the participants who adhered to the diet after returning home.89 A recent randomized controlled pilot study also demonstrated how a plant-based diet can effectively treat diabetic neuropathy among community-dwelling patients with painful diabetic neuropathy pain scores were signifi- cantly improved at 20 weeks on a plant-based diet compared with a control diet.90Current guidelines and macronutrientsIn their 2017 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes theADA states that a variety of eating patterns are acceptable for the management of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes including Mediterranean DASH and plant-based diets.91 These guide- lines recommend carbohydrate intake from legumes whole grains fruits vegetables and dairy products with an empha- sis on nutrient-dense high-fiber low-glycemic load foods.

species of diacylglycerol and ceramide accumulate in hepatic and skeletal muscle cells impairing insulin signaling and thus decreasing glucose uptake.116-119 Saturated fat has been associated with oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunc- tion and insulin resistance in numerous metabolic and epide- miologic studies as well.42-4498100120 In addition diets high in saturated fat are associated with a predominantly gram-nega- tive lipopolysaccharide-rich gut microbial pattern which also leads to insulin resistance and inflammation.118 A plant-based diet has been shown to reduce visceral fat and improve mark- ers of oxidative stress more than a conventional diet in indi- viduals with type 2 diabetes.121Advanced glycation endproducts are oxidant compounds that are high in meat especially when grilled broiled roasted seared or fried and low in plant-based foods such as fruits vegetables legumes and whole grains.122 Advanced glyca- tion endproducts have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes39 and a diet low in these compounds has been shown to improve insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes.123 Nitrosamines which are created when nitrite andnitrate preservatives in processed meat bind to amino com- pounds in those foods have been shown to accelerate DNA damage and generation of reactive oxygen species and pro- inflammatory cytokines leading to oxidative stress and insu- lin resistance.39 Iron from heme animal sources is a pro-oxi- dant molecule that promotes insulin resistance through vari- ous likely mechanisms increased oxidative stress leading to impaired insulin signaling direct pancreatic beta cell toxicity decreased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 channels to the cell membrane and increased hepatic glucose output.39 Several meta-analyses have demonstrated a strong link be-tween serum ferritin or dietary heme iron and the risk of type 2 diabetes.124-127Finally plant-based diets tend to promote weight loss and lower adiposity13128-131 factors that are highly protective against insulin resistance.

Among 41387 individuals followed for two years multiple logistic regression analysis control- ling for body mass index and other variables demonstrated that vegans had a dramatically lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-vegetarians OR 0.381 95 CI 0.236-0.617.14 In another study of 8401 members of the Adventist Mortality Study and Adventist Health Study long-term 17-year adherence to a diet that included at leastweekly meat intake was associated with a 74 increase OR 1.74 95 CI 1.36-2.22 in odds of developing dia- betes compared with long-term adherence to a vegetarian diet zero meat intake this association was attenuated but persisted after statistical adjustment for weight and weight change OR 1.38 95 CI 1.06-1.68.15In a cohort of 4384 Taiwanese Buddhists vegetarian men had approximately half of the rate of diabetes OR 0.49 95 CI 0.28-0.89 and vegetarian post-menopausal women had one-quarter the rate of diabetes OR 0.25 95 CI 0.15-0.42 compared with their omnivorous counter- parts despite statistical adjustment for body mass index and other factors.

Barnard et al.53 performed the first major randomized clinical trial on diabetic patients treated purely with a plant-based vegan diet com- paring it to a conventional diet based on the 2003 American Diabetes Association ADA guidelines.

A total of 99 indi- viduals ages 27-82 years were randomized to counseling on a low-fat vegan diet or the ADA diet and followed for 22 weeks.

Half of the participants were able to discontinue insulin and the remainder were able to significantly reduce theirinsulin overall the average insulin dose decreased from 26 units on the baseline control diet to 11 units on the HCF diet.

The au- thors reported that in 11 patients with severe coronary artery disease who were compliant with a low-fat plant-based diet 8 73 had documented regression of coronary artery dis- ease on repeat angiogram after five years on the diet.
