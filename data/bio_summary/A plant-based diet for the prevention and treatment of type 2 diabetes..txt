species of diacylglycerol and ceramide accumulate in hepatic and skeletal muscle cells impairing insulin signaling and thus decreasing glucose uptake.116-119 saturated fat has been associated with oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunc- tion and insulin resistance in numerous metabolic and epide- miologic studies as well.42-4498100120 in addition diets high in saturated fat are associated with a predominantly gram-nega- tive lipopolysaccharide-rich gut microbial pattern which also leads to insulin resistance and inflammation.118 a plant-based diet has been shown to reduce visceral fat and improve mark- ers of oxidative stress more than a conventional diet in indi- viduals with type 2 diabetes.121advanced glycation endproducts are oxidant compounds that are high in meat especially when grilled broiled roasted seared or fried and low in plant-based foods such as fruits vegetables legumes and whole grains.122 advanced glyca- tion endproducts have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes39 and a diet low in these compounds has been shown to improve insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes.123 nitrosamines which are created when nitrite andnitrate preservatives in processed meat bind to amino com- pounds in those foods have been shown to accelerate dna damage and generation of reactive oxygen species and pro- inflammatory cytokines leading to oxidative stress and insu- lin resistance.39 iron from heme animal sources is a pro-oxi- dant molecule that promotes insulin resistance through vari- ous likely mechanisms increased oxidative stress leading to impaired insulin signaling direct pancreatic beta cell toxicity decreased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 channels to the cell membrane and increased hepatic glucose output.39 several meta-analyses have demonstrated a strong link be-tween serum ferritin or dietary heme iron and the risk of type 2 diabetes.124-127finally plant-based diets tend to promote weight loss and lower adiposity13128-131 factors that are highly protective against insulin resistance.

whole grains including whole-grain bread whole-grain cereals and brown rice have been associated with reduced risk of developing dia- betes1819 a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies found a summary relative risk of 0.68 for three daily servings of whole grains.20 specific fruits and vegetables including root vegetables green leafy vegetables blueberries grapes and apples have been linked to lower diabetes rates.2122 legumes have also been shown to ame- liorate insulin resistance and protect against metabolic syn- drome23-26 and greater nut consumption has been associ- ated with lower diabetes risk.7 cereal fiber appears to be especially protective against type 2 diabetes.27-29diets based on whole plant foods not only maximize protective foods but they also exclude key animal-based foods that tend to promote insulin resistance particularly processed and unprocessed red meat.73038 risk estimates from recent meta-analyses on meat consumption and type 2 diabetes range from 1.13 to 1.19 per 100 g of total red meat per day and from 1.19 to 1.51 per 50 g of processed meat per day.39 animal protein and animal fats have also been linked in both metabolic as well as large cohort studies to worsening insulin resistance and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes.1739-48 in the epic-interact cohort for example van nielen et al.40 observed a 22 higher type 2 diabetes incidence over 12 years in the highest versus lowest quintile of animal protein consumption as well as a 5 higher inci- dence per 10 g increment of animal protein intake multi- variate-adjusted model including body mass index.similarly during 4.1 million person-years of follow up of participants in the nurses' health study nurses' health study ii and health professionals follow-up study malik et al.47 found that individuals in the highest quintile of animal protein consumption had a 13 increased risk of type 2 diabetes 95 ci 6-21 compared with those in the lowest quintiles pooled multivariate model including body mass index.

these results argue for the efficacy of low-fat plant-based diets which are naturally high in carbohydrates and fiber in reversing the insulin resistance that is at the root of type 2 diabetes-- though it remains unclear what component of a plant-based diet is most effective the high carbohydrate and fiber con- tent the low fat and low-animal protein content or both.a 2014 review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials of vegetarian diets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes found a significant reduction in hemoglobin a1c of -0.39 points compared to control diets.58 this effect is approxi- mately half of that seen with the addition of the first-line oral hypoglycemic agent metformin which in a recent me- ta-analysis was reported to reduce hemoglobin a1c by 0.9 points.59 a more recent randomized controlled trial con- ducted in korea compared a brown-rice-based vegan diet with a conventional diabetic diet in patients ages 30-70 years with type 2 diabetes.60 participants assigned to the vegan diet were asked to eat brown rice favor low-glycemic index foods e.g.

increases in consumption of calorie-dense foods including fast foods meats and other animal fats highly refined grains and su- gar-sweetened beverages are thought to play a critical role in the rising rates of type 2 diabetes worldwide.7 lifestyle changes particularly diet can be highly effective in pre- venting treating and even reversing type 2 diabetes.8-11 among the 20 of participants in the landmark diabetes prevention program who were ages 60 and over lifestyle changes conferred a 71 reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes demonstrating that older adults reaped the greatest benefit from lifestyle interventions compared to other age groups.8 lifestyle changes address the root causes of type 2 diabetes and can ameliorate comorbidities while reducing the risk of polypharmacy particularly in the elderly.

among nearly 61000 individuals the preva- lence of type 2 diabetes decreased in a stepwise fashion with each reduction in animal products in the diet from 7.6 in non-vegetarians 6.1 in semi-vegetarians 4.8 in pe- sco-vegetarians 3.2 in lacto-ovo vegetarians to 2.9 in vegans.13 the apparent protection of the vegan dietary pat- tern remained after adjustment for body mass index and other variables with vegans having half the rate of type 2 diabetes compared with non-vegetarians or 0.51 95 ci 0.40-0.66. semi-vegetarians experienced intermediate bene- fit or 0.76 95 ci 0.65-0.90. it is worth noting that the non-vegans in this cohort ate meat and poultry relatively infrequently once a week or more for non-vegetarians less than once a week for semi-vegetarians suggesting that even small increases in red meat and poultry consumption disproportionately increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.prospective studies of the same adventist cohort demon- strate similar findings.

these authors also found that substituting 5 of energy intake from animal protein with vegetable protein was associated with a 23 reduced risk of type 2 diabetes 95 ci 16-30. in a geriatric population ages 65 to 100 years in greece a 5 increase in protein intake from meat and meat products was associated with a 34 greater like- lihood of type 2 diabetes even after adjustments for age gender obesity history of hypertension hyperlipidemia and other dietary habits.49 in contrast protein intake from plant sources offered protection against diabetes.plant-based diets for the treatment of type 2 diabetesas far back as the 1950s studies have been published on treating hyperglycemia with a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet50-52 documenting the effectiveness of employing a pre- dominantly vegetarian diet to treat diabetes.

one study demonstrated a remarkable resolution of burning neuropathy in 81 of participants during a 25-day residential lifestyle program in which plant- based meals were provided including a sustained response in the participants who adhered to the diet after returning home.89 a recent randomized controlled pilot study also demonstrated how a plant-based diet can effectively treat diabetic neuropathy among community-dwelling patients with painful diabetic neuropathy pain scores were signifi- cantly improved at 20 weeks on a plant-based diet compared with a control diet.90current guidelines and macronutrientsin their 2017 standards of medical care in diabetes theada states that a variety of eating patterns are acceptable for the management of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes including mediterranean dash and plant-based diets.91 these guide- lines recommend carbohydrate intake from legumes whole grains fruits vegetables and dairy products with an empha- sis on nutrient-dense high-fiber low-glycemic load foods.

dietary modification is an integral part of the lifestyle recommendations for persons with diabetes it is worth noting that while the vegan diet required greater changes in macronutrient intake than the ada-guided diet there was no difference in acceptability or adherence to the diets55 a finding that has also been demonstrated in other trials.5657 while this may be surprising given the potential degree of change required to adopt a vegan diet the authors hypothesized that not limiting portion sizes not counting calories or carbohydrates and experiencing of a variety of new flavors in the vegan diet likely offset any hardship im- posed by restricting animal products or added oils.55high-carbohydrate low-fat predominantly vegetariandiets are often associated with weight loss making it diffi- cult to ascertain what proportion of the improvement in glycemic control is due to weight loss versus dietary changes.

however a plant-based diet has been shown to be similarly acceptable to an ada diet among people with diabetes55 plant-based diets have also been found to be highly acceptable in other medical contexts.144-146 common questions about specific macro- and micronutrients in plant-based diets have been addressed else- where.141143147148 patients who adopt a plant-based diet can experience decreases in blood sugar and blood pressure rela- tively quickly after changing their diet especially if they are taking medications for these conditions.

interestingly the omnivores in this study con- sumed a predominantly plant-based diet with little meat or fish again implying that small amounts of meat contribute significantly to the development of insulin resistance.16in the largest prospective study of plant-based eating patterns to date satija et al.17 evaluated dietary choices and type 2 diabetes incidence in the nurses' health study nurses' health study 2 and the health professionals fol- low-up study.
