This model has a modest but functionally relevantthreefold elevation in systemic type I IFNs compared with controlsand allows evaluation of the role of augmented type I IFN signaling before influenza infection.To confirm that the lungs of Irgm1-- mice expressed elevated type I IFNs we used multiple assays.

Irgm1 -- mice have elevated type I IFN in the lungs and are resistant to influenza.Bioassay for type I IFN activity see Methods from lung homogenates of littermate control and Irgm1 -- mice n  19 to 21 mice per group from five experiments.

Each metabolite was screened for its in- duction of type I IFN signaling with polyinosinic- polycytidylic acid polyIC a structural analog of double-stranded RNA or amplification of type I IFN pathways with IFN-b treatment fig.

Possibly specific microbial metabolites mediate protec- tion against viral infection.We focused on type I interferon IFN as an important signaling pathway in viral immunity in part because increasing evidence shows that the microbiota can regulate host immune ho- meostasis as well as the response to injury and bacterial infection through type I IFN signaling 12.

These stud- ies primarily use loss of function of type I IFN signaling or administration of high levels of type I IFN.

DAT enhances type I IFN in macrophages via type I IFN amplifi- cation.

4 F and G.Our initial validation of DAT did not discern between augmentation of type I IFN induction or type I IFN amplification.

Consistent with this idea Irgm1--Rag1-- mice which maintain elevated levels of type I IFN showed protection compared with Rag1-- mice fig.
