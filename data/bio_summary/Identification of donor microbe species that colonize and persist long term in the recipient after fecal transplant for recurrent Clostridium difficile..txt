The WSS was calculated for all possible pairwise comparisons of samples for each microbial species of which 21 selected species are shown in Fig.

From the classifier we identified the WSS cutoff value that differentiates a related sample from a non-related sample Supplementary Table 7approach window-based SNV similarity WSS which measures SNV variation between two samples Fig.

Orange dots represent related sample pairs with WSS scores below the boundary cutoff and red dots represent related sample pairs with WSS scores above the boundary cutoff see Supplementary Data.

Using the classifier based on full HMP as a training dataset we classified the FMT-related sample pairs into related represent same SNV pattern and unrelated the sample pair does not share same SNV pattern implying that sample pair might have different microbial species Supplementary Table 7 Fig.

It is possible these F. prausnitzii strains came from dormant microbes that had been sequestered in niches of the recipient and thus not in the fecal samples possibly as a result of the extensive antibiotics used in the C. difficile recipients.Alternatively it is also possible that the new strain in the recipient was a minority strain in the donor sample and thus not detected in the donor but was at a competitive advantage following in the recipient post FMT.

Grey horizontal bars mark the WSS score boundary cutoff derived from the HMP dataset see Supplementary Table 7. b The WSS for different FMT donor-recipients post transplant.

The classifier correctly predicted that all FMT-unrelated samples second category were unrelated.For all pairwise comparisons of FMT-related samples that were predicted as related the WSS were above the WSS classification boundary cutoff all 97-100 Fig.

A window is defined as similar if the SNV pattern denoted as orange bars is exactly the same between two samples for that region or if no SNV S in the equation is present in both samples otherwise the window is called dissimilar denoted as D. The WSS score as a percentage is calculated for each pairwise comparison for every microbial species.

The proportion of similar windows across the genome defines the genome-wide SNV similarity between two samples for a given species and is referred to as the WSS score see Supplementary Data for further explanation.

Red shaded boxes display WSS scores above the WSS boundary cutoff as determined by the classifier suggesting shared microbial species between the two samples.
