Five samples two outer samples from the top layer two outer samples from the bottom layer and one sample from the cen- tral part were obtained from each bunker silo and were thor- oughly mixed to prepare a representative sample.

Regarding the proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes for feces samples our data was similar to that obtained for steers fed a late growing diet mod- erate grain containing 26 corn silage Kim et al.

There is therefore a need to fully understand the extent of variation between microbiota from individual cows under similar diet and management.In dairy practice silage feeding is a popular management method Castillo et al.

In China although the number of taxa was similar for samples from farms D E and F the abundance of the bacteria varied with respect to the families RuminococcaceaeVeillonellaceae Mogibacteriaceae Christensenellaceae Turicibacteraceae Succinivibrionaceae and Spirochaetaceae.Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the first- and second- most predominant phyla in samples from both countries Table .

The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was therefore greater in Chinese samples 1 than in Japanese samples 1.

Additionally the unidentified family p-2534- 18B5 Succinivibrionaceae  Anaeroplasmataceae Methanobacteriaceae and Fibrobacteraceae indicated statis- tical differences between the bacterial populations in samples from the two countries.Cluster analysis revealed that although differences be- tween individual cows were observed the composition of fe- cal microbiota was clearly different in the samples from the two countries.

Moreover two samples from farm B B2 and B3 were grouped in a cluster separate from the cluster that included the other 16 feces samples.

Indeed cluster analysis indicated that silage microbiota was distinctively separated from fecal microbiota and the grouping pattern of silage samples showed no relation to that of feces samples Fig.
