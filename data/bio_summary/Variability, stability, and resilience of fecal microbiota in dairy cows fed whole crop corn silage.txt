the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio was therefore greater in chinese samples 1 than in japanese samples 1. additionally the unidentified family p-2534- 18b5 succinivibrionaceae  anaeroplasmataceae methanobacteriaceae and fibrobacteraceae indicated statis- tical differences between the bacterial populations in samples from the two countries.cluster analysis revealed that although differences be- tween individual cows were observed the composition of fe- cal microbiota was clearly different in the samples from the two countries.

it has been demonstrated that although cows may feed on a diet of an intended formu- lation under tmr feeding cows may consume a greater amount of concentrate than designed under separate feeding nocek et al.

there is therefore a need to fully understand the extent of variation between microbiota from individual cows under similar diet and management.in dairy practice silage feeding is a popular management method castillo et al.

the objective was to improve our knowledge of variations in the fecal microbiota of dairy cows with regard to country farm and individual cows.
