Additionally the IC50 for Bd was measured at 3.8 and 27.3 mM for Bsal by applying a sigmodal growth curve to the data and determining the concentration of prodigiosin when Bd and Bsal growth was at 50.For violacein the MIC for Bd and Bsal was at 15 mM where growth was significantly reduced compared to the pos- itive control T test Bd p  0.0004 Bsal p  0.0001 and was not significantly greater than the heat-killed control T test Bd p  0.1298 Bsal p  1.0.

Because Bd and Bsal CFS had different effects on Serratia growth phosphorous limitation is not likely to be the mecha- nism driving the microbial interactions.While our efforts did not unearth any unprecedented pro- ducers of violacein the production of prodigiosin is indeed widespread among cutaneous bacteria including Serratia spe- cies originating from frogs from Madagascar both wild and captive as well as across the Americas.

EscobarNot detected Not detected Not detectedA confirmatory approach to detect the potential for prodigiosin production by an amphibian cutaneous bacterium was performed for Serratia marcescens and consisted of whole genome sequencing as described in Supplemental Materials.Prodigiosin and Violacein Antifungal ActivityWe tested the ability of commercially obtained prodigiosin and violacein to inhibit growth of the pathogens Bd and Bsal with a dose-response curve analysis.

When Serratia isolates were grown in the presence of cell-free supernatant CFS from the fungi CFS from Bd inhibited growth of the prodigiosin-producing isolates per- haps indicative of an evolutionary arms race Bsal CFS did not inhibit bacterial growth.

The response to both Bd and Bsal CFS was the same in only three Serratia isolates two isolates had no change in growth and growth of one isolate was facilitated by CFS from both pathogens Table .

Indeed Bd can inhibit Serratia growth or prodigiosin production and in two S. marcescens strains the prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster was not upregulated in response to live or dead Bd .

Growth was measured as optical density at 490 nm on a spectrophotometer on days 0 3 and 5 for Bd incubated at 19 degC and days 0 3 5 7 and9 for the slower growing Bsal at 15 degC.Antifungal VOC DetectionTo detect VOCs that can inhibit Bd or Bsal growth we follow- ed the methods of Woodhams et al.
