Even though this study suggests that the vervet gut microbiota may not pro- vide an ideal model for understanding the effect of the human gut microbiota on host metabolism and nutrition in the context of a Western diet the authors state that it may help identify novel therapeutics to improve human resistance to obesity via the gut microbiota if the vervet gut microbiota truly possesses properties that make it resistant to obesity when subjected to a Western diet .

Despite differences in host diet findings from these studies indicate that the gut microbial communities within humans and chimpanzees over- lap at broad taxonomic levels and assort into similar entero- types based on the relative abundances of bacterial genera.Although these findings make a compelling case for using NHPs to study how diet affects the gut microbiota of humans and influences CVD a recent study by Amato et al.

Given the similarities between human and chimpanzee gut microbiota and similarities between human and baboon omnivorous diets other NHP species may be appropriate models for studying the effects of diet on the human gut microbiota and how these host- microbe interactions influence CVD risk.Stem Cells--Therapies and InterventionsStem cell therapies are being developed to treat CVD by two fun- damental mechanisms the stimulation of angiogenesis to develop improved vascularization of damaged heart or vascular tissue and the stimulation of myogenesis to repair damaged cardiac muscle.

Therefore the authors state that NHP models of host-gut microbe relationships may be less ideal than assumed for addressing questions regarding human dietand physiology in the context of the gut microbiota and specu- late that the human gut microbiota may provide increased sus- ceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders particularly when hosts are consuming a high-protein high-fat diet.

In agreement with previous findings in humans recent studies have shown that diet has a profound impact on the microbial composition of the NHP gut microbiota.

Also despite the effects of challenge diets rodents do not readily develop fibrosis    .Other mammalian species have been proposed as NAFLDmodels such as Ossabaw  or Lee-Sung   mini-pigs and laboratory opossums  but to date they have not been widely used for NAFLD-related studies and no long-term data are available to validate the entire complement of characteristic molecular and histological abnormalities seen in human patients.Recent studies suggest that NHPs may develop NAFLD-like abnormalities.

Previous studies examining dietary patterns suggest a strong association between gut dysbiosis and Western diet which tends to be high in fat and animal protein e.g.

Metagenomic studies have shown that the species composition of the gut microbiota is very dynamic and that the majority of changes are a result of the selective pressure that diet exerts on the microbial community   .

When switched to a lean diet obese individuals lose weight and regain Bacteroidetes .Most animal studies of the gut microbiota have been donein a rodent model.

A few studies have used infant rhesus macaques to compare the gut microbiota following formula- feeding and breast-feeding   .
