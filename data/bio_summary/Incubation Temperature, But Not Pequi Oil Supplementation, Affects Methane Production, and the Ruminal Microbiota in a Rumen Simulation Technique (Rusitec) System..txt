demonstrated that the rumen of muskoxen Ovibos moschatus reached minimal temperatures of 31.4C 35.7Cevaluate the effect of pequi oil supplementation and incubation temperature on CH4 production and the ruminal microbiota in a Rusitec rumen simulation technique system.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe donor cow was cared for in accordance with the guidelines of the German Animal Welfare Act approved by the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety LAVES approval number AZ 33.4-42505-04-13A373.Experimental Design and TreatmentsIn vitro ruminal fermentation was conducted using a Rusitec unit to evaluate the effect of incubation temperature and dietary fatty acids from pequi Caryocar brasiliense on the rumen microbiota and methane production.

The lack of effect of pequi oil could be related to the relatively small concentration of pequi oil used in relationto the total volume of the fermenter 1.5 mL pequi oil820 mL fermenter.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of pequi oil high in unsaturated fatty acids and incubation temperature on fermentation characteristics and microbial communities using the rumen simulation technique.

The two treatments consisted of a control diet no pequi oil inclusion and a diet supplemented with pequi oil 1.5 mLday which increased the dietary fat content to 6 dry matter DM-basis.

The two treatments consisted of a control diet CON no pequi oil inclusion and a diet supplemented with pequi oil 1.5 mLday which increased the dietary fat content to 6 DM-basis.Plant ComponentPequi oil was selected to supplement the diets because of its high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids   which have been reported to be effective in reducing CH4 production without compromising diet digestibility and hence milk production in dairy cattle  .Substrate and Rumen InoculumThe substrate consisted of hayconcentrate 66.733.3 ww .

The model included the fixed effects of pequi oil temperature and pequi oil temperature interaction.

However it should be noted that the microbial community on day 28 did not return to a completely similar state as it was on day 14 when the incubation temperature was also 39C.Differentially Abundant OTUs and Taxa between Sample Types Incubation Temperatures and Treatment GroupsDifferentially abundant genera between pequi oil and control samples were identified using LEfSe.

Previous batch culture incubations in our research group indicated that pequi Caryocar brasiliense oil used at 1 vv can reduce CH4 production by up to 74 unpublished data.Microbial activity in the rumen is known to be affected by dietary additives   but information related to the effect of rumen temperature andor incubation temperature on methane production is scarce.

In contrast there was a strong temperature and time effect present in bothTABLE 2  Effect of incubation temperature and pequi oil on methane production and dry matter disappearance DMD.
