Further studies are warranted to elucidate a potential causative link between dysbiosis and pSS.Keywords Primary Sjogren's syndrome Microbiome Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis Disease activityBackgroundPrimary Sjogren's syndrome pSS is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infil- tration of exocrine glands resulting in exocrine hypo- function and sicca symptoms.

The disease may also result in various extraglandular manifestations EGM Correspondence 1Section of Rheumatology Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo Lund University Malmo Sweden7Department of Rheumatology Skane University Hospital Malmo Inga MarieNilssons gata 32 S-205 02 Malmo SwedenFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlesuch as arthritis pulmonary involvement renal disease vasculitis and neuropathy The gastrointestinal GI tract may also be involved and esophageal dysmoti- lity gastroparesis atrophic gastritis and pancreatic insufficiency are commonly encountered in pSS.Increased levels of fecal calprotectin F-calprotectin a validated marker for GI inflammation have been found in a subgroup of pSS patients and were associated with concomitant organic GI disease GI complaints are common in pSS and a large proportion of pSS patientsc The Authors.

In contrast severe dysbiosis among pSS patients was not associated with disease duration IBS-like symptoms or the ESSPRI total score.Conclusions Severe intestinal dysbiosis is a prevalent finding in pSS and is associated both with clinical and laboratory markers of systemic disease activity as well as gastrointestinal inflammation.
