4e f. Altogether these results validate the use of the LOVTRAP approach as a means to manipulate Rho-kinase activity in living cells.Given that the minor neurite retraction induced by NT-3 approximately 15 min was preceded by activation of RhoA 3-5 min Figs a and a b we used the LOVTRAP-RhoA and LOVTRAP-Rho-kinase to evaluate whether local activation of RhoA or Rho-kinase in the cell body could induce minor neurite retraction.

h. These results suggest that active Rho-kinase diffuses from the cell body to short minor neurites but not to long axons and subsequently retracts the growing minor neurites.RhoARho-kinase regulates single axon formation.

c. To examine whether local inhibition of Rho-kinase induces minor neurite elongation we locally exposed the growth cone of a minor neurite of a stage 3 neuron to Y-27632 Fig.

Addi- tionally our computational modeling helps explain how active Rho-kinase diffuses from the cell body to short minor neurites but not to long axons and subsequently retracts growing minor neurites to prevent multiple axon formation.Rho-kinase governs a wide variety of cellular events such as actin filament and microtubule dynamics that regulate axon formation  through several of its substrates including LIM kinase CRMP-2 and Tau-.

The time-dependent concentration of Rho-kinase in the soma is represented by Cst  CoPt where Co and Pt indicate the Rho-kinase concentrations in the cell body during photoactivation and the time course of photoactivation in which the binary variables 0 and 1 represent without and with photoactivation respectively.Notice that this model did not include active transport of Rho-kinase from the cell body to neurite tips in contrast to previous models   .

c d f. These results suggest that long-range inhibitory signaling triggered by neurotrophins exists and induces the retraction of minor neurites.Long-range Ca2 waves regulate minor neurite retraction.

The signals that propagate from the axon terminal to the cell body andor the minor neurites that induce minor neurite retraction remain unknown.

2a-c. We also found that local application of ionomycin to the cell body induced minor neurite retraction indicating that elevation of Ca2 concentration in thecell body is sufficient to retract minor neurites Supplementary Fig.

To examine whether NT-3-induced RhoA activation was responsible for minor neurite retraction we used the following specific inhibitors C3 RhoA inhibitor Y-27632 Rho-kinase inhibitor and bleb- bistatin myosin II inhibitor.

To test whether photoactivated Rho-kinase could diffuse from cell bodies into short minor neurites but not into long axons we developed a mathematical model.
