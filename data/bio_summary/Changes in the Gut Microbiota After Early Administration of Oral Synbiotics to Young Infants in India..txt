We also observed increases in Clostridium 0.03-5 P  0.001 Enterococcus 1.7-30 P 0.02EscherichiaShigella 5-13 P 0.21 Klebsiella 0.005-0.3 P 0.002 Lactobacillus 0.01-0.64 P  0.001and Staphylococcus 0.05-0.1 P 0.56 in the treated group at D-60 compared to control infants.

At D-60 these infants showed significant increases in bifidobact- eria P  0.001 Streptococcus P  0.001 and Acinetobacter P  0.001 with a more than 5-fold increase in Bacteroides 6 - 37 P 0.19.

From D-7 to D-60 there was a significant reduction in numbers of Clostridium 8 - 0.3 P  0.001 EscherichiaShigella 45 - 5 P 0.007 Staphylococcus5 - 0.05 P  0.001 and unclassified Enterobacter 19 -7 P 0.03 in the controls.Synbiotic-treated infants at D-7 also showed a predominance of EscherichiaShigella 21 Clostridia 19 Streptococcus12 Staphylococcus 8 Lactobacillus 7 and Klebsiella 5.

Bifidobacteria were also low at D-60 but showed significant increase only during early first week after synbiotic treatment p  0.035.proportions of Klebsiella 5.2-0.3 P 0.015 Clostridia 19-4.7 P  0.001 lactobacilli 7.1-0.6 P 0.021 and Staphy- lococcus 8.2-0.1 P  0.001 were however observed in the treated infants at D-60 compared with D-7.

Compared to controls synbiotic-treated infants at D-7 showed increased abundance of Lactobacillus 0.004-7 P  0.001 bifidobacteria 0.004-0.06 P 0.035 and Streptococcus 1.4-12 P 0.003.

Although Enterococcaceae were significantly lower at D-7 in the treated compared with controls 0.2 vs 10 P  0.001 this change was reversed at D-60 with a significant increase in the treated group 29.5 vs 1.7 P 14 0.021.Microbiota Changes Discerned at the Genus LevelAt the genus level  control infants at D-7 wereFIGURE 1.

At D-60 there was a marked increase in levels of Enterococcus 0.25-30 P  0.001 Bacteroides 0.9-10P 14 0.22 and bifidobacteria 0.06-0.12 P 14 0.37.

There were however marked reductions in levels of Enterococcus 10-0.25 P 0.001 Bacteroides 7-0.9 and Escherichia Shigella 45-21 P 0.43 in the treated group at D-7.

In control infants we observed a significant increase P 14 0.012 in the proportions of Actinobacteria on day60.
