The complete taxo- nomic assignments for 16S rRNA sequencing datasets can be found in .Further taxonomic characterization was conducted by 16S sequencing in biological tripli- cate on fecal samples from a subset of four mammals the beaver and the porcupine cellulose- Taxonomic assignments for replicate sequencing of the Arctic wolf coyote beaver and porcupine.

in cohabiting human microbiomes -.Beyond taxonomic analysis we compared the cellulose-degradation potential of the Arctic wolf coyote beaver and porcupine microbiomes.

The opposite result was true for the coyote and Arctic wolf.Three cellulose-metabolizing genes were identified from the heat map and selected to com- pare relative gene abundances in the porcupine beaver coyote and Arctic Wolf.

16S rRNA sequencing was validated using metagenomic shotgun sequencing on selected herbivores porcupine beaver and carnivores coyote Arctic wolf.

Samples were normalized for differences in sequencing depth using DeSeq2's negative binomial distribution  and principle coordinate analysis was performed using UniFrac beta-diversity through QIIME .KEGG Orthologs KO - were inferred using PICRUSt to estimate functional-gene profiles from the triplicate porcupine beaver coyote and Arctic wolf triplicate 16S sequencing data .

PICRUSt analysis using 16S sequencing predicted a significant enrichment of the mean relative frequencies of endoglucanase and cellobiose phosphorylase in the beaver 0.099 and 0.015 and porcupine 0.070 and 0.011 in comparison to the Arctic wolf 0.044 and 0.003 and coyote 0.035 and 0.002  p  5.10e-5 and p  3.97e-5 respectively.

We focused our attention on four mammals for in-depth 16S analysis in triplicate the porcupine and beaver Rodentia and the coyote and Arctic wolf Canidae.

Variable regions V6-V8 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified from all purified DNA samples and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using paired-end 300 bp List of oligonucleotides used for 16S rDNA amplification.sequencing .

After stitching more than 50 of sequences remained in each sample and after screen- ing greater than 43.5 of the original sequences remained .Further taxonomic characterization of the porcupine beaver coyote and Arctic wolf microbiomes was conducted by analyzing the metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.

The microbial taxonomy of the beaver and porcupine microbiomes were similar to each other but diverged from microbiome taxonomies of the Arctic wolf and coyote .
