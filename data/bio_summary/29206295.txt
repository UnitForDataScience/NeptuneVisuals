in addition seedling per- formance was not related to the geographic climatic or soil chemical distance between microbial inocula and seed sources p  0.05 for all.hypothesis 3 tree seedlings will perform worse when inoculated with soil microbial communities from their home site than would be predicted based on their response to varying microbial composition among foreign siteswhen statistically controlling for the fact that local inocula had higher microbial community similarity to the ancestral fungal communities we found that performance with the local micro- bial communities was significantly lower than in the foreign com- binations as evidenced by the significantly negative regression parameter associated with the local vs foreign contrast within a linear mixed model that also included fungal community dissimi- larity table s7.

thus whether plant populations are found to be adapted to their local microbial community overall as deter- mined by the comparison of plant growth or fitness with the local vs foreign microbial communities may depend crucially on the structure of the foreign microbial communities used in the comparison.mixed evidence for plant adaptation to local soil communities may be expected when studies focus on particular microbial groups johnson et al.

in addition we compared the microbial composition of the experimental inocula with that of the communities we detected associating with naturally occurring trees at the seedling source populations.we found that seedlings grew similarly when inoculated with local vs foreign microbial communities but this neutral response derived from conflicting patterns - plant populations appeared to be adapted to the presence or absence of whole taxonomic groups in their local microbial community but were simultaneously maladapted to the particular microbial popula- tions present in their local site.as rapid climate change and other factors push tree populations into new areas the suc- cessful establishment of seedlings may depend critically on the balance between the novelty and familiarity of the microbial communities they encounter.introductionplant populations are often found to be adapted to their local conditions savolainen et al.

2015 found that the growth of pseudotuga menziesii trees from two populations transplanted across a range of foreign sites was improved when the transplanted seedlings were able to recruit ectomycorrhizal fungal communities more compositionally simi- lar to the communities on the locally occurring p. menziesii pop- ulation indicating that local populations may be recruiting optimal symbiont assemblages to match local soil conditions.at very large spatial scales introduced plant populations are often found to grow better in the novel soil microbial communi- ties from their introduced range compared with those found in their native range reinhart et al.

all data necessary to replicate these analyses are available as supporting information table s5 with associated metadata.resultshypothesis 1 tree seedlings will perform better with soil microbial communities from their local site vs from foreign sitesseedling growth with local microbial communities did not sur- pass growth with foreign microbial communities either collected from conspecifics at a different site or from a different but related tree species at the same site table 1 fig.

for instance plant pop- ulations may be selected for general resistance mechanisms against certain species or genera of fungal pathogens but be behind in an r-gene-based coevolutionary arms race with the specific pathogen strains in their local soil jarosz  davelos 1995 greischar  koskella 2007 burdon  thrall 2009. similarly tree populations may adapt to the functional capabili- ties of the ectomycorrhizal fungal clades present in their home site but still be enmeshed in a coevolutionary cycle of 'mutual exploitation' such that they are better able to extract resources at a lower carbon cost from nonadapted strains of a given ectomyc- orrhizal fungal species hoeksema 2010. for instance klironomos 2003 found that plant responses displayed greater variance in response to local vs foreign strains of arbuscular myc- orrhizal fungi with some local fungal strains leading to greater plant growth but other local strains leading to substantially reduced plant growth relative to the foreign fungal strains.

1 tree seedlings will perform better with soil microbial communities from their local site vs from foreign sites on average indicating overall adaptation of tree populations to their local microbial communities.

all plants interact with diverse microbial communi- ties but we know little about how these microbial communities as a whole shape the evolu- tionary trajectory of plant populations.we tested whether tree populations were adapted or maladapted to their local rhizosphere microbial communities by growing seedlings sourced from multiple locations with soil micro- bial communities from all locations in a fully reciprocal design using seedling growth as a proxy for fitness.

2 tree seedlings will perform better when inoculated with foreign soil microbial communities that are more compositionally similar to the communities present at their home site indicating adaptation of tree populations to the composition of their local microbial communities at coarse phylogenetic scales independent of the specific coevolved microbial populations.

as a result of a lack of sufficient seedlings one population c. caroliniana from uwharrie national forest was only grown with local intraspecific microbes and another population o. virginianafrom jefferson national forest was only grown with local intraspecific and local interspecific microbes.carpinus caroliniana and o. virginiana seedlings were germi- nated in sterilized soilless potting medium peat mossperlite limestone mixture fafard growing mix 1 agawam ma usa then seedling roots were surface sterilized with 10 bleach and the height and number of leaves were recorded before transplan- tation into experimental pots in july 2012. plants were grown in 1.6-l pots 10.2 cm 9 10.2 cm 9 24.1 cm tp-49 stuewe and sons inc. tangent or usa filled with 800 ml of sterile sand combined with 720 ml of a sterilized field soil mix created by combining the c-irradiated bulk soils from the eight field sites that did not provide the live inoculum.

contrary to our first hypothesis tree seedlings did not per- form better when grown with soil microbial communities from their maternal population vs those from foreign sites suggesting a lack of consistent adaptation to local microbial communities.

as seedling performance among foreign soil microbial communities was optimized by a close compositional match between ancestral and experimental communities one might expect to see the highest performance in the actual local commu- nity.
