In addition we compared the microbial composition of the experimental inocula with that of the communities we detected associating with naturally occurring trees at the seedling source populations.We found that seedlings grew similarly when inoculated with local vs foreign microbial communities but this neutral response derived from conflicting patterns - plant populations appeared to be adapted to the presence or absence of whole taxonomic groups in their local microbial community but were simultaneously maladapted to the particular microbial popula- tions present in their local site.As rapid climate change and other factors push tree populations into new areas the suc- cessful establishment of seedlings may depend critically on the balance between the novelty and familiarity of the microbial communities they encounter.IntroductionPlant populations are often found to be adapted to their local conditions Savolainen et al.

Thus whether plant populations are found to be adapted to their local microbial community overall as deter- mined by the comparison of plant growth or fitness with the local vs foreign microbial communities may depend crucially on the structure of the foreign microbial communities used in the comparison.Mixed evidence for plant adaptation to local soil communities may be expected when studies focus on particular microbial groups Johnson et al.

The model random effects explained an additional c. 18 of total variation indicating sub- stantial variance among plant populations and microbial sources.Hypothesis 2 Tree seedlings will perform better when inoculated with foreign soil microbial communities that are more compositionally similar to the communities present at their home siteWhen excluding local combinations seedling biomass declined with increasing community dissimilarity between the microbialTable 1 Comparison of microbial inocula treatmentsand inocula microbial communities in local vs foreign inocula inFixed effectsEstimatetPLower95 CILower95 CIorder to test whether local interactions are qualitatively different from those that would be expected based on fungalbacterial com- munity composition alone.

In addition seedling per- formance was not related to the geographic climatic or soil chemical distance between microbial inocula and seed sources P  0.05 for all.Hypothesis 3 Tree seedlings will perform worse when inoculated with soil microbial communities from their home site than would be predicted based on their response to varying microbial composition among foreign sitesWhen statistically controlling for the fact that local inocula had higher microbial community similarity to the ancestral fungal communities we found that performance with the local micro- bial communities was significantly lower than in the foreign com- binations as evidenced by the significantly negative regression parameter associated with the local vs foreign contrast within a linear mixed model that also included fungal community dissimi- larity Table S7.

All plants interact with diverse microbial communi- ties but we know little about how these microbial communities as a whole shape the evolu- tionary trajectory of plant populations.We tested whether tree populations were adapted or maladapted to their local rhizosphere microbial communities by growing seedlings sourced from multiple locations with soil micro- bial communities from all locations in a fully reciprocal design using seedling growth as a proxy for fitness.

2 Tree seedlings will perform better when inoculated with foreign soil microbial communities that are more compositionally similar to the communities present at their home site indicating adaptation of tree populations to the composition of their local microbial communities at coarse phylogenetic scales independent of the specific coevolved microbial populations.

2015 found that the growth of Pseudotuga menziesii trees from two populations transplanted across a range of foreign sites was improved when the transplanted seedlings were able to recruit ectomycorrhizal fungal communities more compositionally simi- lar to the communities on the locally occurring P. menziesii pop- ulation indicating that local populations may be recruiting optimal symbiont assemblages to match local soil conditions.At very large spatial scales introduced plant populations are often found to grow better in the novel soil microbial communi- ties from their introduced range compared with those found in their native range Reinhart et al.

1 Tree seedlings will perform better with soil microbial communities from their local site vs from foreign sites on average indicating overall adaptation of tree populations to their local microbial communities.
