Macrolides may be used to treat or help manage respiratory dis- eases and part of the efficacy is considered to be due to anti-inflammatory effects Babu et al.

It is also worth noting that gastrointestinal complaints are the most common adverse effects in pa- tients receiving macrolide therapy Zarogoulidis et al.

However doubts about antibacterial effects of AGPs and the search for alter- native explanations overlook the sub-MIC effects of an- tibiotics.

This paper summarizes some of the reported sub-MIC effects of antibiotics and considers these in the context of helping to explain the mode of action of AGPs and effects seen in studies in vivo.

Given the evidence presented in this paper it seems more likely that the main effects of AGPs are via beneficial sub-inhibitory influences on the dynamics of the GITmicrobiota and that reductions in pro-inflammatory mediators reflect a resultant change in gut-associated lymphoid tissue GALT interactionsstimulation.CONCLUSIONThis paper proposes that sub-inhibitory effects of antibiotics i.e.

effects when antibiotic concentrations are below MIC are responsible for the main effects of AGPs.

Direct effects of AGPs on immune cells are possible but it is suggested that indirect effects by influencing microbial or their products interactions with the GALT are more likely.

Typically pro- posed mechanisms include 1 reducing total microbial density in the gastrointestinal tract GIT 2 promot- ing a more favorable GIT microbial balance andor re- ducing sub-clinical infections 3 reducing the produc- tion of potentially toxic bacterial metabolites and 4 better absorption of nutrients through a thinner intesti- nal epithelium Gaskins et al.
