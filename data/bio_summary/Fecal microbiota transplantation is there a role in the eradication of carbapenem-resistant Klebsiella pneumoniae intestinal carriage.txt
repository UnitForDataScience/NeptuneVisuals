Further- more intestinal colonization with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae CRKP was identified after a positive stool culture in a screening routinely performed in our center in patients recently hospitalized.

Further studies concerning the effectiveness and applicability of FMT in intestinal decontamination of intestinal carriage CRKP are warranted to confirm the successful approach presented in this report.Ana Ponte1 Rolando Pinho1 and Margarida Mota21Gastroenterology Department.

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.DOI 10.17235reed.2017.44252016Dear EditorThe authors present the case of a 66-year-old woman with four hospitalizations due to recurrent Clostridium difficile infection CDI non responsive to vancomycin and fidaxomicin.

In subsequent follow-up appointments the patient remained asymptomatic and three screenings for CRKP with stool cultures performed 15 45 and 100 days after FMT were persistently negative.DiscussionIn recent years CRKP has become a major health problem with an increasing prevalence from less than 1 in 2000 to 8in 2007 of all Klebsiella isolates 2.
