based on their phylogenetic proximity with synthro- phoarchaeales mcr homologues it has been sug- gested that bathyarchaeota mcr may be involved in a similar metabolism  which will require experimental demonstration.these new data provide a novel view on the diversity and evolution of methanogenesis and associated metabolisms for a recent discussion see 2016. in particular they highlight the widespread distribution and the likely underesti- mated environmental importance of methyl-depen- dent hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and question its potential antiquity in addition they are consistent with the hypothesis of a methanogenic ancestor for the archaea and a scenario whereby multiple independent lossestin- kering of this metabolism occurred during archaeal diversification  the details of which remain to be fully understood.new emerging clades in the archaeal treethe availability of genomic data from previously uncharacterized lineages has allowed identification of several interesting new clades.the diaforarchaea a model clade to study adaptive processes in the archaeafollowing the availability of genomic data from previously uncharacterized lineages the new super- class diaforarchaea was recently proposed 1. all diaforarchaea members sequenced so far share two common characters the lack of eukaryotic-like histones otherwise largely present in archaea and the fact that their 16s and 23s rrna genes are not clustered in the genome the diaforarchaea currently contain at least six well-defined lineages 2. other than the already-mentioned methanomassiliicoccales they include the thermoplasmatales which include the only known examples of wall-less archaea and inhabit extreme acidic hot solfataric environments and are important contributors to the release of toxic acid mine drainage into the environment  the deep sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota group 2 dhve-2 aciduliprofun- dum making up 15 of the archaea at hydro- thermal vents where they contribute to sulfur and iron cycling  the marine benthic group d mbg-d a class-level lineage abundant in anoxic deep sedi- ments for which we suggest the name izemarchaea 1 that has a key role in the global carbon cycling through degradation of organic matter 2 the terrestrial miscellaneous euryarchaeotic group tmeg 1 whose members are found in gold mines freshwater marine sediment and peat soils where they degrade long-chain fatty acids and reduce organosulfate or sulfite important for carbon re-mineralization 2 and two class-level lineages corre- sponding to marine group ii mg-ii thalassoarch- aea and marine group iii mg-iii for which we propose the name pontarchaea 1. thalassoarchaea and pontarchaea are abundant in oxygenated surface and deep marine waters where they contribute to the oceanic carbon cycle by degrading extracellular proteins carbohydrates and straight-chain lipids some thalas- soarchaea occupying the shallow photic zone are also able to obtain energy from light by using proteorhodopsins which were acquired via lateral gene transfer from marine proteobacteria .

also it allows understanding the evolu- tionary processes that led to present-day archaeal diversity and drove the emergence of specific metabolic capacities and adaptations to different environments well beyond extreme niches.the majority of the new genomes originate from uncultured lineages representing a sizeable propor- tion of microbial life in sediments and water columns and may significantly increase the already well-recognized importance of archaea as major players in global biogeochemical cycles thus access to genomic data and the associated metabolic potential of the first represen- tatives of these lineages is an important step toward understanding their role in the environment and provides a new outlook on the metabolic diversity of the archaea 2.hereafter we will present an overview of some of the most significant recent findings which are discussed based on an updated robust phylogeny of the archaea obtained from a large taxonomic sampling including all the new uncultured lineages 2. the fast-evolving nanosized lineagesconstituting the proposed dpann superphylum have been treated separately because their monophyly and phylogenetic place- ment are unclear and will be discussed in a dedicated section.the expanding tack superphylumthe tack superphylum was proposed in 2011 based on phylogenetic proximity and signatures shared with eukaryotes .

to that end metabolic predictions derived from genomic data of uncultured archaeal lineages can also provide unprecedented information to guide culture strategies.the analysis of the first genomic data from these newly sequenced lineages has had a strong impact on archaeal systematics leading to the proposal of a multitude of new clades at various taxonomic levels orders classes phyla superclasses superphyla with a wealth of new assigned names that have replaced the original acronyms from environmental 16s rrna studies 1. it is important to remember here that there is no established criterion to propose a new taxonomic status above the class level an important priority to address in modern microbial systematics .

this is consistentwith our phylogenetic analysis 2 where methanofastidiosa are robustly placed within a potential new superclass the acherontia see below 1. interestingly the metabolism inferred from these genomic data indicates absence of co2-reducing or aceticlastic methanogenesis simi- larly to methanomassiiicoccales and a potential24152416the growing tree of archaeaps adam et alspecialization on methylated-thiol reduction with h2 .moreover potential new lineages of methanogens have been reported for the first time within the tack superphylum.

the inclusion of the new archaeal lineages described here extends greatly these two clusters 2.the possibility of a new root lying within the euryarchaeota opens up a new look on the origin and early evolution of the archaea.

nonetheless the placement of parvarchaeota and micrarchaeota is unstable and they also clusteredwith other fast-evolving lineages at different places in the archaeal phylogeny   4.the distribution of archaeal characters in the dpann might provide additional information to complement phylogenetic analysis 4. evolu- tionary analysis of archaeal dna replication compo- nents has highlighted the existence of a potential character shared between nanohaloarchaeota nanoarchaeota and parvarchaeota but not micrarch- aeota the presence of a peculiar dna primase where the large and small subunits pris and pril are combined in a short version of the protein distantly related to the classical archaeal enzyme by searching all currently available dpann genomes we found that a fused primase appears to be a common feature of the large majority of dpann lineages apart from micrarchaeota and diaphero- trites which possess a classical prispril primase 4. this might indicate that at least micrarch- aeota and diapherotrites could be evolutionarily distinct from other dpann lineages.

in addition the diversity of archaea capable of methanogenesis appears much larger than pre- viously thought and among the most exciting discoveries in the archaeal field is the identification of a large number of new lineages of methanogens.methanomassiliicoccales from deep sediments to the human gutthe methanomassiliicoccales former rumen cluster crice cluster iii  are a novel order of methanogens present in various environments such as marine and lake sediments sewers soils and also animal digestive systems insects ruminants humans dridi et al.

the first metagenomic data point24172418the growing tree of archaeaps adam et alin fact to the presence of a complete wl pathway indicating that they are capable of autotrophic metabolism and may represent an important carbon dioxide sink in the subsurface 2. clarifying the placement of altiarchaeales and their evolutionary relationship with the other archaeal lineages is therefore relevant to all infer- ences of the metabolic capabilities of the last archaeal ancestor as well as the origin and evolution of the wl pathway in archaea.in early analyses altiarchaeales were associated to methanococcales 014. according to the recently proposed new root of the archaea and our updated analysis they could represent one of the deepest archaeal branches possibly at the class or even phylum level .

as discussed in this review the monophyly of the dpann needs to be tested further and the root of archaea to be analyzed by using a larger taxonomic sampling including key lineages altiarchaea stygia and the new representatives of acherontia and asgard that were not considered in the williams et al.

these may include for example the transition between anoxic methano- genic lineages and oxic marine lineages environ- ments or the consequences of the loss of the cell wall themoplasmatales.thermococcales gain new friendsthe thermococcales are one of the main model organisms in the archaea .

the split between euryarchaeota and crenarch- aeota for long supported by the distribution of specific characters has now become less sharp following their identification in other phyla 4. for instance homologues of the cell division protein ftsz of eukaryotic-like histones h3 h4 and of dna polymerase pold all characters previously considered as hallmarks of euryarch- aeota are now evident in several lineages of the tack superphylum 4 and can be inferred in the last archaeal common ancestor regardless of where the root lies 2. moreover the distribution of these markers in the new divisions provides further interesting information on the diversity and evolution of fundamental cellular processes in the archaea pold appears to have been specifically lost in the ancestor of crenarchaeota geoarchaeota and ftsz in the common ancestor of verstraetearchaeota and crenarchaeotageoarch- aeota possibly compensated for by the presence of crenactin or archaeal-like escrt systems for cell division 4.in general a search for the distribution of archaeal characters in all novel lineages reveals a much more complex pattern than previously thought.

a more thorough analysis is needed to understand whether such puzzling distribution of characters that have key cellular roles reflects an ancient origin and multiple independent losses during archaeal diversification or rather ancient horizontal gene transfers or both and if these eventsthe growing tree of archaeaps adam et alhad an impact in the adaptation to different environments and lifestyles.an important challenge ahead is to test the new root by including the new genomic data that were made available since our analysis.
