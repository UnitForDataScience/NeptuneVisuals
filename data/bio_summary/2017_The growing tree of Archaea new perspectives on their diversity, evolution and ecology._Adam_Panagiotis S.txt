Also it allows understanding the evolu- tionary processes that led to present-day archaeal diversity and drove the emergence of specific metabolic capacities and adaptations to different environments well beyond extreme niches.The majority of the new genomes originate from uncultured lineages representing a sizeable propor- tion of microbial life in sediments and water columns and may significantly increase the already well-recognized importance of Archaea as major players in global biogeochemical cycles Thus access to genomic data and the associated metabolic potential of the first represen- tatives of these lineages is an important step toward understanding their role in the environment and provides a new outlook on the metabolic diversity of the Archaea 2.Hereafter we will present an overview of some of the most significant recent findings which are discussed based on an updated robust phylogeny of the Archaea obtained from a large taxonomic sampling including all the new uncultured lineages 2.

In particular they highlight the widespread distribution and the likely underesti- mated environmental importance of methyl-depen- dent hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and question its potential antiquity In addition they are consistent with the hypothesis of a methanogenic ancestor for the Archaea and a scenario whereby multiple independent lossestin- kering of this metabolism occurred during archaeal diversification  the details of which remain to be fully understood.New emerging clades in the archaeal treeThe availability of genomic data from previously uncharacterized lineages has allowed identification of several interesting new clades.The Diaforarchaea a model clade to study adaptive processes in the ArchaeaFollowing the availability of genomic data from previously uncharacterized lineages the new super- class Diaforarchaea was recently proposed 1.

The inclusion of the new archaeal lineages described here extends greatly these two clusters 2.The possibility of a new root lying within the Euryarchaeota opens up a new look on the origin and early evolution of the Archaea.

These may include for example the transition between anoxic methano- genic lineages and oxic marine lineages environ- ments or the consequences of the loss of the cell wall Themoplasmatales.Thermococcales gain new friendsThe Thermococcales are one of the main model organisms in the Archaea .

To that end metabolic predictions derived from genomic data of uncultured archaeal lineages can also provide unprecedented information to guide culture strategies.The analysis of the first genomic data from these newly sequenced lineages has had a strong impact on archaeal systematics leading to the proposal of a multitude of new clades at various taxonomic levels orders classes phyla superclasses superphyla with a wealth of new assigned names that have replaced the original acronyms from environmental 16S rRNA studies 1.

As discussed in this review the monophyly of the DPANN needs to be tested further and the root of Archaea to be analyzed by using a larger taxonomic sampling including key lineages Altiarchaea Stygia and the new representatives of Acherontia and Asgard that were not considered in the Williams et al.

The present picture is that of a huge diversity of the Archaea which we are only starting to explore.The ISME Journal 2017 11 2407-2425 published online 4 August 2017Following the first report of the wide distribution of archaeal lineages in the marine environment  a commentary by Gary Olsen stated enthusiastically '...overlooking the Archaea has been equivalent to surveying one square kilometre of the African savanna and missing over 300 elephants' Today this analogy has been largely verified and the initial expectations have even been exceeded.

For these reasons previous analyses of the root of Archaea did not include DPANN lineages Promising alternative approaches are the use of sophisticated evolutionary models and new metho- dological improvements such as those that enable to root phylogenies without the use of a bacterial outgroup thus limiting the risk of tree reconstruction artefacts PerspectivesThese are exciting times for archaeal research.

The blue line and histogram indicate respectively the annual and cumulative number of validly described archaeal species Source List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature with names published until July 2016--in the frame of nomenclature and classification consistency of major reference databases.Under such a deluge of genomic data the estab- lishment of a robust phylogenetic frame for the Archaea and in particular the placement of all the new uncultured lineages becomes of paramount importance.

In addition the diversity of archaea capable of methanogenesis appears much larger than pre- viously thought and among the most exciting discoveries in the archaeal field is the identification of a large number of new lineages of methanogens.Methanomassiliicoccales from deep sediments to the human gutThe Methanomassiliicoccales former Rumen Cluster CRice Cluster III  are a novel order of methanogens present in various environments such as marine and lake sediments sewers soils and also animal digestive systems insects ruminants humans Dridi et al.
