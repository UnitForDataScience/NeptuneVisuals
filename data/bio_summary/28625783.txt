to model the bacterial population dynamics we assumed a minimal model n  gn - sn - dn where n is the population change rate n is the population size g is the population growth rate constant s is the population shedding rate constant and d is the population death rate constant.

we additionally take into account seeding from the inoculum and the stable colonizer population to model the rate of lumen population change asl  dl - mthl 1 - l  s n  k c - x1811lwhere l is the bacterial population in the lumen l is the probability of population increase m is the probability of population decrease kl is the maximum sustainable lumen population a.k.a.

in the derivation we additionally considered several additional factors including i shedding due to flow through the gut ii the exchange of bacteria the inoculum population and the bottleneck population and iii additional subpopulations such as the crop a side compartment of the gut that stores food for later passage into the proximal gut.

the drop in bacterial load of lf and hs over the first 4 days suggests a fundamental asymmetry between the inoculum population and the stable population that occupies the gut af- ter establishment.growth rate measurements in the gut suggest a population bottleneckdifferences in colonization efficiency could be caused by different growth rates.

because the food population is much larger than the gut population evolution in the lab should favor faster growth on the fly food which could allow weak intes- tinal colonizers to persist.there is more than one way to stably colonize a fruit fly gutstable population maintenance results from the balance be- tween bacterial growth in the gut and bacterial loss from thegut.

instead our results suggest that the ability of wf to stably attach to host tissue near the anterior end of the gut may overcome stochastic population dynamics and make colonization deter- ministic even at extremely low inoculum b. thus as in macroecology niche processes can overcome neutrality particularly at local scales .implications for healthchanging the composition of the human gut in a precise way has proved difficult in practice.

in the simplest case we model the changes in inoculum population in the proximal gut due to decayn  - d1n2for nr0 where n is the inoculum population d1 is the decay constant.

basing the derivation on standardlangmuir binding of free particles to open sites on a solid surface we model the rate of change in the bottleneck population asb  k ndtth kmax- bth- k2b6where nmax is the maximum inoculum population kb is the maximum occupancy of the bottleneck site k1 is the binding rate of free bacteria to open sites in the bottleneck habitat and k2 is the loss from the bottleneck site modeled as a decay rate times the number of bacteria in the bottleneck site b. dndtthnmaxth is thus the relative occupancy of the gut.

these alternative states are driven by a fundamental asymmetry between the inoculum population and the stably colonized population that is mediated by spatial localization and a population bottleneck which makes stochas- tic effects important by lowering the effective pop- ulation size.

if we assume that the bottleneck population equilibrates faster with the inoculum than the inoculum population decays we can integrate the steady-state bottleneck  on the interval 120 tex to find the total chances of colo- nization for a given inoculation doseztex0ln keqn0  e-d1 t10ln keqn0  11dbthdt  bt0 kbt -maxd1a kbmaxd1a9which quickly approaches its limit of kbtex as n0 increases where tex is the characteristic time for the inoculum population to decay below a threshold.this result tells us two things.

therefore stable gut diversity may be driven by inherently stochastic processes which has important implications for combatting infectious diseases and for stably establishing probiotics in the gut.resultsprecise oral inoculation of individuals reveals that colonization is probabilisticto examine how bacteria are naturally transmitted to flies we exposed isogenic populations of germ-free flies to two different concentrations of 16 fly commensal bacteria representing 12 species and we measured colonization success the estab- lishment of bacteria in the gut.
