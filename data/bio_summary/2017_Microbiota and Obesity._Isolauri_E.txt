Hence notwithstanding incomplete evidence from clinical intervention studies thus far the composition of the gut microbiota may be taken to represent a strategic contributor to obesity as it pertains to excessive energy intake from an unhealthy diet and disproportionate storage of energy owing to sedentary behavior.Gut Microbiota and Obesity Epidemic Cause Consequence or MechanismScientific interest in the potential causative role of the gut microbiota in obesity was attracted by the demonstration that a distinctive gut microbiota composi- tion prevails in obese individuals with adjustments following weight gain or weight loss 16.

Further support for the conception of microbiota involvement in obesity is obtained by epidemiological data linking known causes of gut micro- biota disturbance early in life namely cesarean section delivery and antibiotic exposure to the subsequent development of overweight and obesity reviewed in 4.

Indeed the demonstration of active inflammatory cas- cades in the ileum in response to a high-fat diet prior to the onset of obesity invites the notion that the low-grade inflammation of obesity may be initiated in the gut and specifically by the gut microbiota the presence of which is a pre- requisite in the progression of inflammation.

Interestingly dietary fatty acids of which circulating levels are often increased in obesity have previously been shown to induce insulin resistance through the same signaling pathways linking the nutritional environment to the gut micro- ecology within the innate immune regulation 23 26.Gut Microbiota Profiles Are Causally Linked to the Obesity RiskThe most plausible evidence of a causal relationship between dysbiosis and the obesity risk has been obtained from experimental studies demonstrating that gut microbiota transfer from an obese individual can produce the obese phenotype in the recipient 27 28.

Multifaceted therapeutic ap- proaches are called for to halt the cascade from neonatal adiposityhigh birth weight to childhood excessive weight gainadult obesity with comorbidities.

Conversely being highly sensitive to environmental impacts particu- larly to early feeding the compositional development of the gut microbiota may prove the target of choice in efforts to reduce the risk of obesity.

It has been demonstrated that a lower number of bifidobacteria precedes the development of obesity and a dearth of butyrate-producing bacteria and an overall richness of bacteria increase the risk of meta- bolic disease moreover recognition that practices known to disrupt the early gut micro- biota e.g.

cesarean section delivery and antibiotic exposure contribute to obesity en- courages to pursue this line of research.c 2017 Nestec Ltd. VeveyS.

Indeed overweight and obesity can be seen as belonging to the familyof noncommunicable diseases sharing common environmental risk factors and immunologic features which frequently coexist and constitute a threat to hu- man well-being.
