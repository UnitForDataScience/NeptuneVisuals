Rapidly fermentable dietary fibre is fermented in the proximal colon and results in increased SCFA levels in this region of the gut conversely slow fermentable dietary fibre will reach the distal colon and modulate SCFA production at this site .Many researchers have shown mixtures of multiple dietary fibre types are more beneficial than a single dietary fibre -.

Supernatants collected after the non-digestible fraction of cooked common bean Phaseolus vulgaris L. when fermented with gut microbes were able to induce apoptosis of HT-29 colon cells and this was thought to be due to the participation of other phenolic fatty acid derivatives and biopeptides and not the SCFA contained in the supernates  Therefore it may be possible that the phytochemical compounds from cincau or cincau fermentation induce autophagic cell death which cannot be measured by either the caspase or LDH assay but would be worth investigating in future studies.Our research implies that the beneficial effects of mixed dietary fibre as experienced in most human diets will depend on how each dietary fibre consumed interacts with the colon microbiota and suggests the important role of unidentified compounds produced during fermentation by gut microbes in modulation of the effect of dietary fibre on CRC carcinogenesis.

Both inulin and cincau FS inhibited cell growth compared to the FB and the caspase inhibitor was able to partially prevent this inhibition when inulin was the dietary fibre Figure C p  0.05.A3500300025002000150010005000Inulin II-CaspaseinhibitorCincau Cin Cin-CaspaseinhibitorFaecal blank FBFB-Caspase inhibitorControlB800000070000006000000500000040000003000000200000010000000Inulin II-CaspaseinhibitorCincau Cin Cin-CaspaseinhibitorFaecal blank FBFB-Caspase inhibitorControlC140120100806040200Inulin II-CaspaseCincau Cin Cin-Caspase Faecal blank FB-CaspaseControlinhibitorinhibitorFBinhibitorFigure 5.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of green cincau extract on short chain fatty acid SCFA production in anaerobic batch cultures inoculated with human faecal slurries and to compare these to results obtained using different dietary fibre types pectin inulin and cellulose singly and in combination.

Research has shown that dietary fibre mixtures may be more beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention than a single dietary fibre type.

This study demonstrates for the first time that this Indonesian traditional source of dietary fibre may be protective against colorectal cancer.Keywords dietary fibre colorectal cancer fermentation cincau short chain fatty acidsIntroductionColorectal cancer CRC incidence is rising significantly in most countries due to increasing prosperity .

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of cincau extracts as a traditional source of dietary fibre with other dietary fibre combinations known to be protective against CRC.

As cellulose alone had no effect on SCFA production and inhibited SCFA production when mixed with inulin no further studies were performed on FS from these two dietary fibre groups.

LDH release in cells treated with FS when cincau was the fibre source was lower compared to that from inulin FS and FB Figure B p  0.05.

Surprisingly FS from blank FB induced higher alkaline phosphatase levels than pectin inulin or pectin-inulin even though all of these dietary fibre FSs had high SCFA concentrations.
