both inulin and cincau fs inhibited cell growth compared to the fb and the caspase inhibitor was able to partially prevent this inhibition when inulin was the dietary fibre figure c p  0.05.a3500300025002000150010005000inulin ii-caspaseinhibitorcincau cin cin-caspaseinhibitorfaecal blank fbfb-caspase inhibitorcontrolb800000070000006000000500000040000003000000200000010000000inulin ii-caspaseinhibitorcincau cin cin-caspaseinhibitorfaecal blank fbfb-caspase inhibitorcontrolc140120100806040200inulin ii-caspasecincau cin cin-caspase faecal blank fb-caspasecontrolinhibitorinhibitorfbinhibitorfigure 5. effect of inulin and cincau on caspase 37 activity a ldh release b and caco-2 cell viability c with or without caspase inhibitor.

taking this into account data from this study indicate that the effect of fss from dietary fibre on cell differentiation may depend on several factors including scfa pattern and unidentified products formed during the fermentation process or that originally exist in the fresh faecal sample as a source of inoculums.the ability of pectin inulin pectin-inulin and pectin-cellulose fss to induce apoptosis was confirmed by their ability to increase caspase 37 activity compared to control figure  p  0.05. in contrast cincau and fb when compared to control decreased levels of caspase 37. previous research has shown that inulin induced apoptosis in ht-29 cells  or in a colon cancer rat model .

the fs treatments were also applied to separate caco-2 cells cultured in 96-well plates for determination of cell proliferation using the mtt assay.to confirm the role of caspase 37 in the cell death mechanism fs from the inulin cincau extract and faecal blank fermentation were applied to the caco-2 cells in combination with 10 um caspase inhibitor ac-devd-cho promega.

in contrast when cells were incubated with fs from cincau fermentation very little caspase activity was detected and the inhibitor had no significant effect on this activity figure a p  0.05. ldh release in cells treated with fs when cincau was the fibre source was lower compared to that from inulin fs and fb figure b p  0.05. ldh release was not affected by the addition of the caspase inhibitor.

therefore some factors other than scfas might be involved in modulating caspase 37 activity .fss from inulin cincau and fb were chosen to further elucidate the role of caspase 37 on cell death using the caspase inhibitor ac-devd-cho before the application of fs.

the fs from inulin induced cell death through a caspase 37-dependent pathway as the release of caspase 37 could be inhibited by the addition of the caspase inhibitor and this led to an observed increase in caco-2 cell viability.

fss from all dietary fibre sources including cincau failed to increase alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels but unexpectedly some caused significant decreases in alkaline phosphatase levels figure  p  0.05. cells that were incubated in fs after fermentation with inulin and mixtures of pectin and inulin had significantly lower alkaline phosphatase activity compared to fb whereas cells incubated with fs from pectin mixture of pectin-cellulose and cincau displayed similar alkaline phosphatase activities to fb p  0.05.9080706050403020100figure 3. effect of dietary fibre fs on alkaline phosphatase ap enzyme levels.

butyrate levels were only significantly increased in the fs after fermentation with inulin inulin-cellulose and inulin-pectin figure d.a120100806040200b80706050403020100figure 1. cont.c121086420d454035302520151050figure 1. effect of dietary fibre on the concentration of short chain fatty acid scfa total a acetate b propionate c and butyrate d in fermentation supernatants.

caspase 37 activity was affected by the type of dietary fibre fermented by colon microbiota figure  p  0.05. pectin individually or in combination with inulin induced higher caspase 37 activity compared to no treatment control.

the caspase inhibitor significantly inhibited the ability of fss from both inulin and the faecal blank to induce caspase 37 activity.

our results support that inulin or pectin-inulin fss are able to induce apoptosis through caspases as caspase 37 activity increased in caco-2 cells incubated with these fss figure  p  0.05.pectin or pectin-cellulose mixtures also increased caspase 37 activity figure  p  0.05 and this may support a role for pectin via its increase in scfas as a dietary fibre that can affect the apoptosis process.

supernatants collected after the non-digestible fraction of cooked common bean phaseolus vulgaris l. when fermented with gut microbes were able to induce apoptosis of ht-29 colon cells and this was thought to be due to the participation of other phenolic fatty acid derivatives and biopeptides and not the scfa contained in the supernates  therefore it may be possible that the phytochemical compounds from cincau or cincau fermentation induce autophagic cell death which cannot be measured by either the caspase or ldh assay but would be worth investigating in future studies.our research implies that the beneficial effects of mixed dietary fibre as experienced in most human diets will depend on how each dietary fibre consumed interacts with the colon microbiota and suggests the important role of unidentified compounds produced during fermentation by gut microbes in modulation of the effect of dietary fibre on crc carcinogenesis.

combining pectin with inulin in the fs had no significant effect on the ability of inulin or pectin to inhibit cell growth.120100806040200figure 2. all dietary fibre sources reduced caco-2 cell viability.

a modification of the aoaci method 994.13  was used to determine dietary fibre composition as soluble and insoluble non-starch polysaccharides nsps .table 1. composition of dried green cincau extract g100 g dry weight.in vitro fermentation of dietary fibreseven substrates as a single or a mixture of two dietary fibres 5050 were tested following a csiro protocol adelaide australia pectin inulin cellulose pectin-cellulose mixture inulin-cellulose pectin-inulin and green cincau extract table .

furthermore this study demonstrates that pectin and inulin alone or in combination had the greatest influence on individual and total scfa production after fermentation by gut microbiota.
