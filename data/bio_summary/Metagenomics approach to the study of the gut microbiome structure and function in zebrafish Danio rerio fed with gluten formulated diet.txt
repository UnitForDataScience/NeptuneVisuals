in this study we determined the microbial compositions in the gut ecosystem of d. rerio fed with a gluten formulat- ed diet gfd or a control formulated diet cfd using nextgen illumina miseq targeting the v4 region within the 16s rrna gene.

4. box-plot showing the predictive functions of bacterial communities in d. rerio fed with control formulated diet cfd and gluten formulated diet gfd.

based on these results we conclude d. rerio to be a suitable alternative animal model for the use of a targeted metagenomics approach along with bioinformatics tools to further investigate the relationship between the gluten diet and microbiome profile in the gut ecosystem leading to gastrointestinal diseases and other undesired adverse health effects.c 2017 published by elsevier b.v.introductionthe neolithic revolution from hunter-gatherer survival into agricul- tural strategies redefined diet  incorporating larger quantities of wheat products barley and rye -- of which the prolamin fraction is known to contain wheat protein gluten  .

welch's t-test was used for two-group comparison of the cfd and gfd samples with confidence intervals set to 95 0.95.resultstotal sequence reads quality trimming and otus informationa total of 563879 raw sequence reads from four samples 2 samples from cfd and 2 samples from gfd of d. rerio were listed in .

a comparative analysis of the bacterial distribution at the lower taxonomic levels in cfd and gfd samples showed that bacteroides desulfovibrionaceae bifidobacterium lachnospiraceae oscillospira and ruminococcus were found only in cfd samples whereas rhodobacter legionellales pirellulaceae luteolibacter and pseudoxanthomonas in gfd samples .

examinations of the microbiota of patients with cd and ncgs have concluded similar increases of harmful gram- negative bacteria pathobionts and overall microbial dysbiosis .to explore the effect of a gluten formulated diet gfd on both the composition and the metabolic profile of the microbiota an examina- tion of a model animal lacking a pre-existing aversion to gluten is war- ranted.

in accordance with these previous reports we have sampled the entire zebrafish gut tissue that included the internal digesta in our study.this study for the first time demonstrated a uniform and distinct gut microbial profile in d. rerio fed with gfd which contrasted their coun- terparts fed with cfd.

be- cause of this it is possible to formulate a gluten diet to elucidate the ef- fect of the microbial composition in the gut ecosystem of laboratory raised d. rerio.in recent years nextgen sequencing ngs technologies have made it possible to describe the microbiota occurring in the gastrointestinal tracts of host organisms by targeting the 16s rrna genes of the collec- tive bacterial genomes microbiome as they change in response to diet  .
