Additionally eight OTUs were associated with high basal levels of IL-8 and GEC response to LPS with high basal levels of IL-8 and 1 with low basal levels of IL8.

Basal IL- 8 levels after 6 h cultivation under standard conditions control IL-8 levels after incubation with 10 ugml EC-LPS for 6 h ecLPS and IL-8 levels after incubation with 10 ugml PG-LPS for 6 h pgLPS were determined in the supernatant by ELISA MerckDNA Extraction Preparation of 16S rRNA Gene Target Amplicons Libraries and Sequence AnalysisDNA was extracted from samples using a phenol-chloroform protocol with bead-beating and precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 M Na-Acetate and 0.6 volumes of ice-cold isopropanol  .

Pairwise comparison of basal IL-8 levels with nominal data for all participants n 21 showed no differences in basal IL-8 levels concerning gender allergies the use of floss mouthwash the consumption of chewing gum the intake of hormones only women and pain killers .The presence of zinc and film formers in the toothpaste reported by participants did not have an influence on basal IL- 8 levels but for plant extracts pairwise comparison resulted in p 0.046 with mean values of 47.6 24.5 pgml n 17 in the absence and 20.2 12.6 pgml n 4 in the presence of plant extracts in the toothpaste respectively.

On relative levels ecLPSpgLPS over basal IL-8 in percent differences to control 100 were found in the high level ecLPS group with an unexpected decrease in IL-8 levels of10.6 16.1 p 0.038 whereas no other group showed significant alterations in IL-8 release levels.

Basal IL-8 levels obtained in this study were neither comparable to levels found in crevicular fluid of patients with periodontitis over 90000-fold higher nor to levels obtained by stimulated salivary measurement 250 pgml in healthy individuals which is to be expected due to impaired oral health and different sampling method as compared to our study    .

The correlation of basal IL-8 levels with all metric parameters of the questionnaire  showed a positive correlation with the pH of the supernatant R  0.477 p  0.029 as well as the consumption of red wine R  0.457 p  0.037 and white wine R  0.485 p  0.026.TABLE 2  Spearman correlations of basal IL-8 levels with metric questionnaire parameters considering all participants n  21.IL-8 vs.Corr.

No pairwise comparisons of absolute IL-8 levels were statistically significant.Alpha DiversityOral microbiota richness was not significantly different between low and high basal IL-8 levels observed species p 0.534 Chao1 estimated richness p 0.163.

Likewise alpha diversity metrics which consider both community richness and evenness were not significantly different Shannon p  0.449 inverse Simpson p  0.895.Associations of Oral Microbiota with Nutrition and Oral Hygiene HabitsThe composition of the oral microbiota was associated with nutrition and oral hygiene habits at the OTU level as well as taxonomic levels from genus to phylum with significant associations with basal IL-8 levels gender body mass index BMI allergies flossing habits chewing gum use and consumption of tea meat beer white wine and sweets perMANOVA p  0.05 .

RDA ordination revealed a strong correlation between basal IL-8 levels and meat consumption but not for tea floss habits and allergies .Stimulation of Oral GECs with 10 ugml LPS from EC or PGEx vivo challenge of brushed cells with EC- or PG-LPS did not affect basal IL-8 levels with means for untreated cells ecLPS and pgLPS-incubated cells of 42.4 25.0 39.2 22.3 and40.7 24.1 pgml respectively .

Also for the earlier designated low IL-8 n 12 and high IL-8 n 9 groups no differences in absolute basal IL-8 levels of controls compared to levels after treatment with EC- and PG-LPS were found.
