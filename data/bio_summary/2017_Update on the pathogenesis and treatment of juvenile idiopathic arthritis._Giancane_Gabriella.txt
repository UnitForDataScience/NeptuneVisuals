a genotyping analysis from this region revealed a strong association between human leukocyte antigen hla-drb1 amino acid position 13 and both oligoarthritis and rheumatoid factor- negative polyarthritis 12 the shared genetic association of these two subtypes is in keeping with the notion that in the current jia classification patients with homogeneous features are misplaced in diverse disease categories the obser- vation in the same study of mixed hla associationtable 1. international league of associations for rheumatology classification criteria for juvenile idiopathic arthritis in childhoodsystemic arthritis4-17arthritis with or preceded by daily fever of at least a 2-weeks quotidian forat least 3 consecutive days th one or more among evanescent nonfixed erythematous rashgeneralized lymph node enlargement hepatomegaly andor splenomegaly serositisa b c dpolyarthritis rf-negative11-30arthritis of 4 joints within the first 6 mo rf-a b c d e psoriatic arthritis2-11arthritis and psoriasis or arthritis th at least two amongb c d edactylitisnail abnormalities pitting or onycholysis psoriasis in a first-degree relativeundifferentiated arthritis11-21criteria in no category or two or more of the above categoriesexclusion criteria a psoriasis or a history of psoriasis in the patient or a first-degree relative b arthritis in a hla-b27 positive male beginning after 6 years of age c ankylosing spondylitis enthesitis-related arthritis sacroiliitis with inflammatory bowel disease reiter syndrome or acute anterior uveitis or a history of one of these criteria in a first-degree relative d presence of igm rf positive on at least two occasions at least 3 months apart e presence of systemic jia.ilar international league of associations for rheumatology jia juvenile idiopathic arthritis mo months rf rheumatoid factor yrs years.2volume 29  number 00  month 2017copyright c 2017 wolters kluwer health inc. unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.update on pathogenesis and treatment of jia giancane et al.table 2. main characteristics of biologic agents currently used in juvenile idiopathic arthritisetanercepttnfriifcigg1tnf-ab0.8 mgkgweek or 0.4 mgkg twice weeklymaximum dose 50 mgsc102 - 30 hadalimumabmab anti-tnf-atnf-a24 mgm2 q2 weeks max 40 mgsc10-20 days infliximabmab anti-tnf-atnf-a6-10 mgkg q2 weeks - 2 monthsiv200 htocilizumabmab anti il-6ril-6poly jia 2 yrs 30 kg 10 mgkg q4 weeksiv8-14 dayspoly jia 2yrs 30 kg 8 mgkg q4 weeks sjia 2 yrs 30 kg 12 mgkg q2 weeks2 yrs 30 kg 8 mgkg q2 weekscanakinumabmab anti il-1il-1b22 years 4 mgkgdose q 4 weekssc23-26 daysmaximum dose 300 mgil interleukin iv intravenous poly polyarticular sc subcutaneous syst systemic tbc tuberculosis yrs years.in juvenile psoriatic arthritis patients argues against the assumptions that children with this condition constitute a single homogeneous population 15 a large association study on european patients revealed that hla-drb1 11 alleles which are linked to oligoarticular and rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular jia confer an increased risk of devel- oping systemic jia .

however pathogenetic investigations should take into account that jia is not a single disease but constitutes a heterogeneous group of illnesses with presumably distinct genetic background and pathophysiologytable 1.in the last two decades the management of jia has been revolutionized by the introduction of bio- logic response modifiers which have provided an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of patients who are resistant to conventional antirheu- matic medications namely methotrexate mtx or sulfasalazine table 2. these advances have increased the expectation for disease control in addition evidence is accumulating to support the benefit of early aggressive therapy .in this review we provide an update of studies published in the last year regarding pathogenesis and treatment of jia.update on pathogenesissystems biology conducted through the analysis of networks of genes and proteins is a powerful tool to identify biological pathways of relevance to com- plex genetic diseases.

the authors speculated that the acquired impairment of nk-cell function may be part of the immune dysregulation seen in systemic jia and constitute the link between this illness and macrophage activation syndrome mas.restriction of peripheral blood tregulatory treg cell repertoire and clonotypic expansions in both blood and synovium were found by next- generation sequencing analysis in children with jia but not in a sample of healthy controls and of children with lyme arthritis.

in addition patients with jia shared an expanded portion of synovial fluid treg cell clonotypes that were private to jia and not seen in lyme arthritis.

the microbiome perturbation was found to correlate with the disease status with an increased inter- individual variability during active disease and a different pattern during remission a micro- biome profile similar to that reported in type i diabetes and characterized by an abundance of bacteroidetes and low levels of firmicutes has been demonstrated in new-onset patients with jia indirect support to the pathogenic role of micro- biome comes from the reported link between the risk of development of jia and environmental factors affecting the microbiome composition such as delivery mode and early antibiotic use .

infection was the most common trigger of mas and the clinical features of the syndrome were notmodified by cnk.in the current 'biologic era' intra-articular corti- costeroids iacs and mtx remain cornerstone medi- cations for the therapy of jia 46 a multicenter randomized trial conducted in italy compared iacs alone versus iacs plus mtx administered orally in children with oligoarticular jia.

application of network biology can provide new insights into the molecular heterogeneity of jia and help to refine its classifi- cation.

the major histocompatibility complex has long been recognized as the most important contributor to jia susceptibility.
