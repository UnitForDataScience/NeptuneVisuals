A genotyping analysis from this region revealed a strong association between human leukocyte antigen HLA-DRB1 amino acid position 13 and both oligoarthritis and rheumatoid factor- negative polyarthritis 12 The shared genetic association of these two subtypes is in keeping with the notion that in the current JIA classification patients with homogeneous features are misplaced in diverse disease categories The obser- vation in the same study of mixed HLA associationTable 1.
