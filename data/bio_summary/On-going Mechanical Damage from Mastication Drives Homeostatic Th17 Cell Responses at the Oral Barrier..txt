These data highlight that diverse tissue-specific mechanisms govern education of Thl 7 cell responses and demonstrate that mechanical damage helps define the immune tone of this important oral barrier.Keywords mucosal immunology Thl 7 cells IL-17 oral immunity barrier immunity periodontitis T cellsGraphical AbstractGotoIntroductionGotoBarrier-resident immune populations integrate local cues to generate responses that preserve barrier integrity maintain host-commensal interactions and aid in fighting infection Cash et al.

Therefore elucidating the factors involved in the induction and regulation of Thl 7 cells in this environment will shed light on the tissue-specific cues that regulate immunity in the gingiva.Here we delineated the mechanisms controlling accumulation of Thl 7 cells in the gingiva.

Our datademonstrate that gingival Thl 7 cells were not dependent on colonization by commensal bacteria as the Thl 7 cell population was unchanged in germ-free mice.

Next we assessed whether enhanced proliferation or survival of Thl 7 cells could be contributing to the enlarged gingival Thl 7 cell population with age.

Staining of gingiva Thl 7 cells from 8- and 24-week old mice for the proliferation marker Ki67 and the anti-apoptotic marker B cell Lymphoma 2 Bcl-2 showed that increased proliferation not survival contributed to the enlarged gingival Thl 7 cell population that emerged with age Figure 1G.We extended these observations to human gingiva by evaluating IL-17 cell frequencies in younger 18-25 years of age and older 40-50 years of age healthy volunteers with no evidence of periodontitis Eke et al.

No difference in the frequencies of gingival Thl 7 cells in SFB and SFB- mice were seen Figure 2F demonstrating that gingival Thl 7 cell development was independent of SFB.

Moreover despite similar Thl 7 cell frequencies Tac and Jax mice had significant differences in their oral bacterial communities Figures 2G and S2 further suggesting that the oral microbiome may not be a primary driver of gingival Th17 cell development.Gingival Th17 Cells Arise Independently of Commensal ColonizationTo fully evaluate the role of commensal bacteria in promoting gingival Thl 7 cells we examined these cells in age-matched germ-free GF and specific-pathogen-free SPF mice.

Moreover the frequencies of gingival Treg cells were similar in GF and SPF mice Figure S3E.In sum our data show that in contrast to other barrier sites bacterial colonization was not required to promote the physiological accumulation of Th17 cells in the gingiva highlighting that unique factors ensure that Thl 7 cells populate this barrier.Gingival Th17 Cells Are Dependent upon IL-6Next we sought to determine the cytokine cues required for accumulation of gingival Thl 7 cells.

We found that development of gingival Thl 7 cells was dependent on IL-6 as Thl 7 cells were drastically reduced in the gingiva of il6-deficient animals Figure 4C.
