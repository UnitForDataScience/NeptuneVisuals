the substrate of bt2261-64 is not known but the presence of homologues of both susd bt2263 and susc bt2264 indicates that the complex is involved in nutrient acquisition.

a pisaanalysis reveals that the ligand interacts more extensively with susc than susd 540 a2 and 300 a2 of buried surface area respectively suggesting that the complex is a transport intermediate by which a peptide ligand has been transferred from susd to susc and is now tightly bound as is typical for tbdt substrates.

the extent of opening between different simulations varies owing to thermal fluctuations but in the most open states susd rotates around 40-45deg and completely loses its contacts with loops l1 l3-5 and l9-l11 of susc and supplementary videos 1-3. analysed in a different way the ca-ca distance between residues at the front of the complex thr296 in susd and asn203 in susc increases from approximately 6 a in the closed ligand-bound complexes to approximately 40 a in open ligand-free states .

however anomalous difference maps could be produced that provided a useful independent registry check using the 51 methionine residues present in the tetrameric bt2261-64 complex.the structures of the bt2261-64 complex in space groups p212121 and p21 were solved by molecular replacement in phaser using the individual components from the p1 crystals as search models and refined with phenix.

the locus coding for bt2261-64 on the b. theta genome is not in an operon with any other genes.the structure of bt2261-64 was solved to 2.75 a resolution using molecular replacement and supplementary tables 1-3 see methods.

to our knowledge the dimeric organization of susc is unique for tbdts.the susd-like subunit bt2263 hereafter susd is located on top of susc forming an extracellular lid on the transporter and generating a large interface area of approximately 3800 a2 .

the structure of susd bound to susc is identical to that of susd in isolation  demonstrating that no conformational changes occur upon binding to susc.

the ligand is present in a large cavity between susc and susd that is not solvent- accessible  and nine out of ten residues make backbone inter- actions with either susc or susd residues and .

the octamer simulation demon- strates that susc dimerization does not impede opening of the susd lid and moreover suggests that both suscd hubs function independently  and supplementary video 3. a final implication of the computational results is that because removal of the ligand produces a mechanistically sensible response that is susd lid-opening the molecular dynamics simulations support our modelling of the bt2261-64 ligand as an oligopeptide.

in contrast to those of suscddplug the plug-less susc channels are stable indicating that the extracellular loops of susc are not responsible for the dynamics observed in suscddplug .

lastly full-length susc susc with plug behaves similarly to full-length suscd and does not form channels demonstrating that refolding and reconstitution generates correctly folded transporters.

diffraction data were collected at 100 k at the diamond light source on beamlines i03 bt2263 i04 bt2261-64 and bt1762-1763 and i24 bt2261-64.

in this crystal there is only one susc protomer within the asymmetric unit with the susc homodimer generated by crystallographic symmetry.

the datasets generated coordinate files and structure factors for bt2261-64 have been deposited in the protein data bank with accession numbers  and for bt2261-64 space groups p1 p212121 and p21 respectively for bt2262 and for bt2263.
