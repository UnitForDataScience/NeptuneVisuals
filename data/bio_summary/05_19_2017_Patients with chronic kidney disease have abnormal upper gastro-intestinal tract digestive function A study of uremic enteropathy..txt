Four CKD patients had gastric half-emptying times above 107 min which has been shown to be the upper limit of normal for a healthy population.21 Two patients had more than 30 of their meal still present in the stomach 180 min after ingestion.Both CKD patients and healthy subjects demonstrated a high degree of variability in all measurements of SBWC with fasting SBWC ranging from 10-104 mL in patients and 9-226 mL in healthy subjects.

Further study is required to assess the factors that contribute to this dysfunction in a wider CKD population.IntroductionThe complex relationship between the gastrointestinal GI tract and complications of chronic kidney disease CKD has been increasingly recognized over the past few years.

All patients recruited with CKD Stage 5 were receiving treatment with peritoneal dialysis duration 5-27 months.Notable exclusion criteria included any known chronic GI disease including Irritable Bowel Syndrome a history of major GI surgery prescription of drugs affecting GI motility significant cardiovascular morbidity or diabetes.Twenty-three healthy volunteers with normal renal function were recruited from the general population and were subject to the study imaging protocol as patient participants.

At these times digestive secretion and water absorption are the major factors determining SBWC suggesting that there is abnormal digestive function in the small bowel in CKD patients.Renal impairment is well known to disrupt intestinal homeosta- sis in the large bowel through alteration in the composition of gut microflora direct influence of uremia on the enterocyte and the intra-luminal production of uremic toxins.22 However small intestinal digestive dysfunction in patients with kidney disease has not previously been identified.

Animal models of chronic uremia have shown that the dysfunction observed with the defensive colonic barrier is mirrored in both the gastric and ileal mucosadespite being relatively sterile6 although bacterial colonization is a feature of advancing CKD.7 Studies have consistently demon- strated abnormal upper GI motility in those with renal impairment which appears to worsen with advancing CKD stage.8-10 Drug absorption and elimination have been shown to be abnormal within the small bowel which has been proposed to be linked to accumulation of inflammatory cytokines uremic toxins and the effects of excess parathyroid hormone.1112 Abnormal small bowel digestive secretion has also been documented in several studies.1314 Combined these abnormalities represent a dysfunc- tional phenotype specific to CKD which affects a significant proportion of the GI tract beyond colonic dysbiosis.

This present study was designed to comprehensively describe upper GI function in those with advanced renal impairment.Methods Thirty-five non-diabetic subjects 12 CKD stage 45 patients 23 healthy con- trols underwent detailed GI magnetic resonance imaging MRI in both fasted and fed states.
