thus a deeper understanding of the causes of genital inflammation and the underlying mechanisms by which vaginal bacteria might lead to reduced efficacy of arv- based strategies for prep is needed to produce effective hiv prevention modalities.partial hiv protection demonstrated by the caprisa 004 vaginal microbicideglobally more than 90 of hiv is transmitted following heterosexual sex.

genital cytokine biomarkers of inflammation have been associated with both the number of local target cells and the potential to compromise the ability of the genital mucosa to serve as an effective barrier to hiv infection the combined effect of genital inflamma- tion on mucosal barrier integrity and hiv target cell numbers likely contributes to the association of genital inflammation and infection by less-infectious hiv variants  recent findings have suggested that vaginal bacteria could be an important underlying contributor to baseline inflammation and hiv risk in women living in sub-saharan africa.the vaginal microbiome and hiv riskincreasing evidence suggests that microbial communities in the female genital tract could directly impact genital inflammation and hiv acquisition risk.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.90 of white women in developed countries have lactobacillus-dominant vaginal communities whereas the majority of south african women were found to have low lactobacillus abundance without clinical indication of bacterial vaginosis which highlights the importance of geography in defining what constitutes a 'normal' vaginal environment.

for example the use of vaginal products for hygiene or for dry vaginal secretions to increase sexual pleasure has been reported to be common in several sub-saharan african countries.

these products might cause changes in vaginal ph and the microbiome lead to increased inflammation and disrupt the vaginal- epithelial barrier which could impact hiv risk and micro- bicide efficacy in women a role for lactobacillus dominance in improving the efficacy of vaginal tenofovir gelrecent findings by klatt et al.

a further oppor- tunity for investigation is longitudinal analysis of vaginal bacterial community dynamics particularly given the in- fluence of the menstrual cycle endogenous hormones hormonal contraceptives and vaginal insertive practices.

the centre for the aids programme of research in south africa caprisa 004 study was a double-blind random- ized placebo-controlled trial conducted in kwazulu-natal south africa which demonstrated that a single vaginal ap- plication of a microbicide gel containing the antiretroviral arv tenofovir within 12 h before and then after sex re- duced hiv acquisition by 39 overall and by 54 in women with high levels of gel adherence  although poor adherence diminished drug efficacy in this and later correspondence  equal contributors1centre for the aids programme of research in south africa caprisa university of kwazulu-natal durban south africa3ragon institute of mgh mit and harvard harvard medical school cambridge ma usafull list of author information is available at the end of the articlegenital inflammation and hiv acquisition risk during sexual transmission of hiv productive infection is facilitated by micro-abrasions in the mucosal barrier and access to local activated cd4 t cells hiv target cells.

showed that young south african women with diverse vaginal microbial communities and low lactobacillus abundance acquired hiv at over four-fold higher rates than those with l. crispatus dominance.

diverse vaginal microbial communities were closely associated with elevated genital inflammatory cytokines and cervical hiv target cells which probably contrib- uted to increased susceptibility to hiv.

furthermore behavioral genetic and envir- onmental factors are also likely to impact the effect of the vaginal microbiome on hiv risk.

notably the authors demonstrated that in women with a lactobacillus- dominant community the risk of hiv acquisition was re- duced by 61 using the tenofovir gel whereas no signifi- cant hiv protection was observed in those with a vaginal microbiome dominated by non-lactobacillus species.

additionally a closer examination of the mechanism of host sensing of vaginal bacterial communities that lead to increased hiv acquisition risk might help identify novel targets to reduce this risk.future considerationsresearch on the relationship between the genital micro- biome and hiv risk has raised several key considerationsfor future investigations.

despite good concordance between the proteomic footprint and 16s rrna gene sequence data for some bacterial taxa 16s rrna analysis revealed diversity in the lactobacillus-dominant group that the proteomics data could not resolve which raises concerns about whether these approaches are adequate at this time to fully unravel the complexities of vaginal microbial com- munities.
