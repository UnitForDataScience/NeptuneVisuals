these encompassed data sets derived from the human gut and other body sites as well as a range of non-human gut and environmental habitats supplementary table s1.analysis of the cumulative relative abundance of sequences with similarity to fb124-14 orfs across habi- tats showed no significant differences between whole community human gut metagenomes and non-human gut or environmental data sets fig.

significant differences between the relative repre- sentation of fb124-14 orfs in human gut viromes compared to other data sets was determined using the kruskall-wallis test with dunn's correction for multiple comparisons in graphpad prism 6 for os x.simulation and modelling of virome-based source tracking using fb124-14 ecogenomic signaturesthe use of fb124-14 relative abundance profiles for microbial source tracking was evaluated using a monte carlo-based simulation with uniform probability distribu- tion input derived from the maximum baseline relative abundance values for each fb124-14 orf across all environmental viral metagenomes.

a.to determine if these 'gut-associated' fb124-14 relative abundance profiles represented a habitat-related signal in fb124-14 or could be attributed to properties of phage genomes or the human gut virome in general we repeated this experiment using additional genomes from phage not considered to be associated with the human gut.

d e f g.detection of the fb124-14 ecogenomic signal in whole community metagenomesbecause the human gut virome is believed to be dominated by temperate phage   and we have previously demonstrated that conventional whole community shotgun metagenomes derived from human gut bacteria capture notable fractions of the gut-associated bacteroides phage population  we next explored the representation of fb124-14 orfs in assembled whole community metagen- omes.

h.the fb124-14 ecogenomic signal can discriminate human gut viromes from other data setsgiven the observed enrichment of sequences with similarity to fb124-14 orfs in mammalian gut-derived viral meta- genomes and other human-derived whole community metagenomes we next examined the potential for this putative ecogenomic profile to distinguish human gut metagenomes from those derived from other habitats.

fb124-14 gut-associated profiles were added to environ- mental profiles at 'strengths' ranging from 100 to 0.01 to explore the range over which the fb124-14 gut-associated ecogenomic signal may be detectable when combined with background environmental signals.this showed a correlation between dilution of the fb124-14 human gut-associated ecogenomic signal and separation of 'contaminated' data sets from human gut or 'uncontaminated' environmental viromes fig.

a. overall this analysis suggested that the potential dis- criminatory power of the fb124-14 ecogenomic signal was preserved despite the additional wide variation in the innate background environmental signal and that it could also distinguish different sources of pollution.to evaluate the possible discriminatory power of fb124-14 relative abundance profiles and specific human gut- affiliated orf subsets in more detail roc curves were constructed based on relative abundance profiles from all fb124-14 orfs as well as subsets exhibiting significantly higher representation in human gut viromes compared to other viral data sets fig.

collectively analysis of both fsyn5 and fks10 provide further support for the hypothesis that relative abundance profiles of genes similar to fb124-14 orfs in metagenomic data sets are indeed reflective of a gut-related ecogenomic signal.congruent with the concept of fb124-14 as a collective of genes with independent evolutionary trajectories was the clear variability in gut affiliation of individual orfs evident across the fb124-14 genome.

the average relative abundance of each fb124-14 orf within human gut viromes  n 12 was added to the corresponding fb124-14 orf relative abundance in selected environmental viromes on a gene-by- gene basis at 'strengths' ranging from 100 to 0.01. the viromes subjected to this simulated human faecal pollution were selected based on those most likely to be already impacted by human activity andor contain a strong innate background environmental signal distinct from that of the gut microbiome bay of british columbia sargasso sea gulf of mexico tampa bay and reclaimed water.

the ability of fb124-14 human gut ecogenomic signals to discriminate polluted environmental data sets from original uncontaminated data sets was evaluated using nmds ordi- nation and anosim as described above.identification of regions of the fb124-14 with the strongest ecogenomic signalthe variation in the 'strength' of the human gut-associated fb124-14 ecogenomic signal across the phage genome and representation in data sets from distinct environmental groups was assessed by transforming all relative abundance values by addition of a small positive value y  0.00001 before conversion to log10 hitsmb dna.

differences in relative abundance within human gut viromes or fb124-14 orfs was compared to profiles observed in bovine and porcine gut viromes environmental viromes as well as whole community human gut and environmental metagen- omes.

as such fb124-14 constitutes an excellent model with which to begin to explore the existence of habitat-specific ecogenomic signatures in phage genomes and their application to development of improved mst approaches.resultsrepresentation of sequences with similarity to bacteriophage-encoded orfs in viral metagenomesto evaluate the relative representation of genes with simi- larity to those encoded by fb124-14 in viral metagenomes we calculated the cumulative relative abundance of sequen- ces similar to translated fb124-14 open reading frames orfs in each metagenome fig.

a. no significant differences were apparent between the mean cumulative relative abundance of fb124-14 human gut vir- omes and other gut viromes examined fig.
