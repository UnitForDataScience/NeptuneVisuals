Strachan proposed the well-known hygiene hypothesis which suggests that the lack of exposure to the microbiome may contribute to the increased prevalence of atopic diseases and since this time the association between the microbiome and asthma has been studied Several epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to a diverse microbial envi- ronment in early life was inversely related with the risk of asthma  Previous studies on the microbiome in asthma have mainly focused on intestinal microbial communities and their roles in the development of immune function through the concept of a common mucosal response Recently with the understanding of the microbiome in the lower respiratory tract more and more studies are now focusing on the relationship between coloni- zation of the lower airway microbiome and immune toler- ance as well as the impact of lower airway dysbiosis on chronic airway diseases including asthma.Lower Airway Dysbiosis in Adult Asthma.

demonstrated that persistent exposure to farm dust and endotoxin protected mice from HDM-induced asthma by reducing airway epithelial cell cytokines which activate dendritic cells thus suppressing Th-2 immune response to HDM allergen Therefore the lack of bacterial colonization after birth resulted in exaggerated allergic reactions which persisted into adult- hood indicating that the lung microbiome is dynamic and airway dysbiosis in early life can result in sustained suscepti- bility to airway allergic diseases Like the role of the intestinal microbiome the lower airway microbiome may contribute to maintaining local homeostatic and inflamma- tory immune responses of the lung However asthma is a heterogeneous disease and there is a complex interaction between the lung microbiome and host immunity which may impact on the risk of asthma development.The role of airway dysbiosis in the development of asthma needs further study.Corticosteroids and Airway DysbiosisDo Corticosteroids Induce the Airway Dysbiosis in Asthma Current guidelines recommend the use of ICS for asthma to control airway inflammation The impact of corticosteroids on the airway microbiome is unclear.

For example the intestinal microbiome is known to influence host immunity by balancing the activities of T helper Th type 1 and Th-2 cells and playing a fundamen- tal role in the induction of inflammatory or tolerogenic conditions  Dysbiosis known as the imbalance in the composition of the bacterial microbiome relates with host inflammatory response may also be an important major factor in the development or the chronicity of humandisorders such as inflammatory bowel disease diabetes and asthma -In the last six years with the development of sequenc- ing technologies the lower airway is no longer considered to be sterile and a growing body of evidence supports the concept that the healthy lung microbiome may have tran- sient changes that may impact the progression of the disease -Furthermore new evidence suggests that there are differences in microbiome in lower airways between the healthy subjects and those with chronic respi- ratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease COPD and asthma -Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease man- ifesting in recurrent exacerbations of wheeze dyspnea chest tightness and cough with many distinct phenotypes and endotypes The symptoms of most patients with asthma can be relieved by short-acting beta2 agonists and low doses of inhaled corticosteroids ICS which is the first-line treatment for the majority of patients howeverapproximately 10 of patients requires the maximal ICS dose and between 5 and 10 of adults with asthma are resistant to steroid treatment accounting for over one- half of asthma-related healthcare costs Understanding the contribution of lower airway microbiota to the pathogen- esis of asthma especially steroid-resistant asthma could transform our understanding of asthma and provide novel therapeutic targets.

An examination of the lung microbiome in HIV-infected patients found that Tropheryma whipplei was highly more frequent in the BAL of HIV- positive individuals compared with HIV-negative individuals This result was consistent with another study in which the alteration of lung microbiome was reported to be asso- ciated with HIV infection And a new study published by Moreira and colleagues shows how the bacterium Bur- kholderia multivorans evolves and adapts in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients The above results show that the airway microbiome is influenced by the host immune response and the bacteria may evolve in adapting to a spe- cific lung environment.The microbiome is also influenced by its environment.

Conversely a study examining the composition of the lower respiratory tract microbiome in 10 healthy participants found that the lung bacterial communities resembled those from the mouth but identified a specific lung microbiome with higher abun- dance demonstrating that the lung microbiome did not derive solely from the mouth This result is similar with a recent finding showing that the main source of the healthy lung microbiome is the mouth which is caused by microas- piration while the nose makes little contribution Lower Airway Dysbiosis and AsthmaSince the 1980s a marked increase in the prevalence of atopic diseases has been steadily increasing in developed countries.

In patients with severe asthma the lower airway microbiome of bronchial brushing from 40 participants most of whom were refractory to corticosteroids was significantly enriched in Actinobac- teria compared with mild asthma Diversity of the microbiome is important to promote host immunity and may become a new biomarker of health Previous studies have reported increased diversity of opportunistic pathogens and decreased diversity of benefi- cial flora in asthma compared with healthy controls and that increased diversity was significantly correlated with bron- chial hyperresponsiveness Moreover other investi- gations showed a similar microbiota diversity between asthma and controls Loss of microbiota diversity is another manifestation of microbiome dysbiosis.
