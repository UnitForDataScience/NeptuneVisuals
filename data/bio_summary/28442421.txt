At the family level Anaeroplasmataceae was significantly higher and Lactobacillaceae was significantly lower in the WD-NC Pg group compared to the WD-NC group E. At the genus level Anaeroplasma was significantly higher in the WD-NC Pg group compared to the WD-NC group while several genera from phylum Firmicutes were significantly higher in the WD-NC group compared to the WD-NC th Pg group E.Fecal samplesLinear discriminant analysis effect size LEfSe was applied to the microbiota data from the three groups that were fed a normal chow diet during the final 11 weeks NC WD-NC WD-NC th Pg and identified 6 differentially abundant taxa a 0.05 with an LDA score higher than 2.0 respectively Supplementary Fig.

This analysis identified 20 differentially abundant taxa a 0.05 with an LDA score higher than 2.0 D. At the phylum level Bacteroidetes was significantly higher and Firmicutes was signifi- cantly lower in the WD group compared to the WD-NC group D. At the family level Peptostreptococcaceae Clostridiaceae Streptococcaceae Ruminococcaceae and S24-7 were significantly higher and Lactobacillaceae was significantly lower in the WD group compared to the WD-NC group D.To assess the impact of P. gingivalis on the gut microbiota of ApoE-- mice that had been switched to a normal chow diet after being fed a Western diet for 11 weeks LEfSe was applied to the microbiota data from the WD-NC and WD-NC th Pg groups and identified 10 differentially abundant taxa a 0.05 with an LDA score higher than 2.0 respectively E. There were no differ- entially abundant phyla.

Dietary intervention WD-NC partially resolved Western diet-induced dysbiosis importantly we demonstrated that P. gingivalis oral infection blunts this resolution WD-NC vs. WD-NC th Pg.Relative abundance of bacterial taxa in fecal and cecal samplesIn cecal samples the relative abundance of phylum Tenericutes ranged from 0.1 to 3.2 with an average of 1.4 in the NC group in all other groups the relative abundance of phylum Tenericutes was1 for all mice D. The relative abundance of phylum Acti- nobacteria phylum Cyanobacteria and phylum Proteobacteria in the cecal contents was 1 for all mice in all treatment groups data not shown.

As expected all WD samples fell into the two highest categories of plaque index while all NC samples fell within the two lowest categories C. With one exception all WD-NC samples also fell within the two lowest plaque index categories C. All four plaque index categories were represented in the WD-NC Pg group however one subcluster consisted only of the two highest categories similar to the WD group C. The WD-NC th Pgplaque index categories were consistent with the observed clus- tering described by the cage effect.

All experimental procedures involving pathogenic bacteria were carried out with approval from the Boston University Institutional Biosafety Committee.Mouse randomization and treatment groupsMale ApoE-- mice on C57BL6 background Jackson Labora- tory of 8 weeks of age were randomly assigned into one of the following four groups normal chow NC for 22 weeks Teklad Global 2018 18 kcal from fat Envigo Madison WI n 6 Western diet WD for 22 weeks TD.88137 42 kcal from fat with 0.2 cholesterol Envigo Madison WI n 6 Western diet for 11 weeks followed by normal chow for 11 weeks WD-NC n 7 or Western diet for 11 weeks followed by normal chow for 11 weeks and P. gingivalis oral infection at weeks 12e14 WD-NC Pg n 15 following the infection protocol previously published by our group that results in the acceleration of atherosclerosis in ApoE-- mice .

Mice that were infected with P. gingivalis and switched to a normal chow diet following 11 weeks on a Western diet WD-NC Pg had a significantly higher plaque index than non-infected mice that were also switched to a normal chow diet following 11 weeks on a Western diet WD-NC.

The relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes in cecal samples from the WD-NC group ranged from9.6 to 18.6 with an average of 13.1 compared to a range of 4.8e28.0 with an average of 16.9 in the WD-NC Pg group A.

The relative abun- dance of family Ruminococcaceae ranged from 3.5 to 15.7 with an average of 9.6 in the NC group from 15.6 to 28.6 with an average of 20.3 in the WD group from 8.1 to 13.1 with an average of 11.6 in the WD-NC group and from 6.9 to 12.0 with an average of 9.8 in the WD-NC Pg group Supplementary Fig.

Unweighted UniFrac revealed distinct clusters for the WD group vs. the NC group a third cluster was comprised WD-NC and WD-NC Pg groups Supplementary Fig.

Cluster 1 grey consisted of 2 OTUs 260679 and 287507 both of the phylum Firmicutes that were highly abundant in the WD-NC and WD-NC Pg groups E .
