Upon identifica- tion 12 MALDI-TOF MS spectra for strain Mt12T were included in the URMITE database.Growth conditionsOptimal growth conditions for strain Mt12T were determined by testing five growth temperatures 25 28 37 45 and 56 degC in an aerobic atmosphere with or without 5 CO2 and under anaerobic and microaer- ophilic conditions using the GENbag Anaer and GENbag microaer systems respectively BioMerieux Marcy l'Etoile France.

Strikingly fructose was not metabolised in contrast to most of the compared species.Strain Mt12T was found to be susceptible to rifampicin gentamicin 500 lg tobramycin penicillin G oxacillin ceftriaxone doxycycline and ciproflox- acin but resistant to gentamicin 30 lg imipenem trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole teicoplanin metron- idazole colistin and erythromycin.Genome propertiesThe draft genome of strain Mt12T is 3497275-bp long with a 30.45 GC content Fig.

However additional comparative genomics notably with C. profunda are desirable as additional sequences become available.ConclusionConsidering the specific phenotypic properties of strain Mt12T including its low matching MALDI- TOF MS score the 94.9 16S rRNA similarity level with C.profunda and its genomic analysis we hereby suggest the creation of a new genus within the family Clostridiaceae named Inediibacterium with the type species Inediibacterium massiliense type strain Mt12T CSUR P1907  DSM 100590.Description of Inediibacterium gen. novInediibacterium In.e.di.i.bac.te'rium.

Pierre-Edouard FournierReceived 17 November 2016  Accepted 3 February 2017  Published online 11 February 2017c Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017Abstract A novel strain Mt12T CSUR P1907  DSM 100590 was isolated from the fecal sample of a 7-month-old girl from Senegal afflicted with severe acute malnutrition.

The draft genome of strain Mt12T is 3497275-bp long with a 30.45 of GC content.

DialloUnite' de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes IRD 198 CNRS 7278 Aix- Marseille Universite' Marseille Francephylogenetic analysis alongside the dDDH values under 30 and phenotypic characteristics suggest that strain Mt12T represents a new genus within the family Clostridiaceae for which the name Inediibacterium massiliense gen. nov. sp.

In the process we isolated a strain strain Mt12T representing a new genus a member of the family Clostridiaceae.

We herein describe strain Mt12T CSUR P1907T  DSM 100590T as the type strain of the type species of Inediibacterium massiliense gen. nov. sp.

Biochemical analysis of strain Mt12T was carried out using API 50CH API 20A API ZYM strips BioMe'rieux in an anaerobic atmosphere.

Genomic DNA gDNA was quantified by a Qubit assay with the high sensitivity kit Life technologies Carlsbad CA USA to123.7 ngll.The genomic DNA gDNA of strain Mt12T was sequenced using a MiSeq sequencer Illumina Inc San Diego CA USA and the mate pair strategy  .
