the gc content of strain mt12t 30.44 is lower than those of all compared species 34.0-36.8. similarly the total number of genes 3397 and the number of protein-coding genes 3268 of strain mt12t are smaller than that of all compared species except a. oremlandii 3016. the distribution of genes into cog categories is similar for all compared species except for the presence of 1 protein in the extracellular structures category which is only present in strain mt12t fig.

upon identifica- tion 12 maldi-tof ms spectra for strain mt12t were included in the urmite database.growth conditionsoptimal growth conditions for strain mt12t were determined by testing five growth temperatures 25 28 37 45 and 56 degc in an aerobic atmosphere with or without 5 co2 and under anaerobic and microaer- ophilic conditions using the genbag anaer and genbag microaer systems respectively biomerieux marcy l'etoile france.

the scale bar represents 500 nmthe major cellular fatty acids of strain mt12t were identified as c140 46 c161n7 21 and c160 18. c40 a short chain fatty acid was also detected as shown in table .catalase and oxidase activities were absent con- sistent with the anaerobic metabolism of strain mt12t.

strikingly fructose was not metabolised in contrast to most of the compared species.strain mt12t was found to be susceptible to rifampicin gentamicin 500 lg tobramycin penicillin g oxacillin ceftriaxone doxycycline and ciproflox- acin but resistant to gentamicin 30 lg imipenem trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole teicoplanin metron- idazole colistin and erythromycin.genome propertiesthe draft genome of strain mt12t is 3497275-bp long with a 30.45 gc content fig.

however additional comparative genomics notably with c. profunda are desirable as additional sequences become available.conclusionconsidering the specific phenotypic properties of strain mt12t including its low matching maldi- tof ms score the 94.9 16s rrna similarity level with c.profunda and its genomic analysis we hereby suggest the creation of a new genus within the family clostridiaceae named inediibacterium with the type species inediibacterium massiliense type strain mt12t csur p1907  dsm 100590.description of inediibacterium gen. novinediibacterium in.e.di.i.bac.te'rium.

in the process we isolated a strain strain mt12t representing a new genus a member of the family clostridiaceae.

we herein describe strain mt12t csur p1907t  dsm 100590t as the type strain of the type species of inediibacterium massiliense gen. nov. sp.
