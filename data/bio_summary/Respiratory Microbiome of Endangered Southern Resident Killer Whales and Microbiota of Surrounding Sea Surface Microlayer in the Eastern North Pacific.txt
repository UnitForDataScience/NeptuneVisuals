Matrix cells in red signify resistance matrix cells in green signify sensitivity and matrix cells in gray indicate no testing because the antibiotic is not appropriate for the bacterium.flora of the killer whale upper respiratory system via 1 sampling wild individual free-swimming SRKWs at a population level 2 annual sampling of the population over 4 years to identify exhaled breath and SML microbial variation in space and time 3 repeated individual sampling to determine if the microbial composition evolves over time and 4 comparison of the microbial profile in the SML with that of SRKW exhaled breath samples to assess the extent of pathogen exposure and recruitment within the host.Our methodology captured a single exhaled breath of a surfacing SRKW in its critical habitat a snapshot that presumably under-represents the actual microbial profile of the respiratory tract.

This study aimed to determine the microbial composition of the SML and exhaled breath samples of the SRKW population to compare the microbial pro- files of exhaled breath samples and SML of proximal waters and to assess differences in microbial composition.

An assessment of the composition of microorganisms within both exhaled breath samples and the SML could reveal a potential relationship between host respiratory and SML microbial flora.Research on lung microbiota has disproved the long-held belief of lungs as sterile organs.

breath samples were distinct from SML samples both in community dispersion and centroid distances Supplementary Table  sug- gesting that exhaled breath samples were not simply aerosolized SML or sea water.

After each sampled whale breath control air samples were collected at the same time as the SRKW exhaled breath samples by exposing a series of agar plates described above to the air then processed in an identical manner to breath and SML samples.To collect SML samples sterile Plexiglas sheets were placed on the sea surface during calm sea con- ditions and surface tension adhering water samples were transferred into sterile containers using a ster- ile squeegee and funnel Supplementary Fig.

In addition no cytopathic effect CPE was observed in cell lines after three weeks incubation and PCR did not detect specified viral pathogens in exhaled breath samples or SML.Bacteria recovered from exhaled breath samples and SML differed among animals and across sampling years for the same animal Table .

Resistance patterns of recovered bacteria varied by year and between SML and exhaled breath samples.DiscussionThis study is the first to characterize the microbial contents of exhaled breath from a wild population of killer whales.

During each sampling year SML samples were collected dur- ing two different sampling periods and microbial culture of the SML yielded a preponderance of bacteria with the highest detections for Pseudoalteromonas spp.

To characterize the composition of the respiratory microbiota and identify recognized pathogens of SRKW exhaled breath samples were collected between 2006- 2009 and analyzed for bacteria fungi and viruses using 1 culture-dependent targeted PCR-based methodologies and 2 taxonomically broad non-culture dependent PCR-based methodologies.Results were compared with sea surface microlayer SML samples to characterize the respective microbial constituents.
