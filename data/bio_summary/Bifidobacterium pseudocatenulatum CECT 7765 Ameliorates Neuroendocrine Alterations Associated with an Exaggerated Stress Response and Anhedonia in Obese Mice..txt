We found that obese mice showed anhedonia p  0.050 indica- tive of a depressive-like behavior and an exaggerated hypothalamic-pituitary axis HPA-mediated stress response to acute physical p  0.001 and social stress p  0.050 but these alterations were ameliorated by B. pseudocatenulatumElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article  contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.Ana Agusti Yolanda Sanz 1 Microbial Ecology Nutrition and Health Research Unit Institute of Agrochemistry and Food Technology National Research Council IATA-CSIC C Catedratico Agustin Escardino 746980 Paterna-Valencia Spain2 Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas CIBERNED Cell Biology Department University of Valencia Valencia SpainCECT 7765 p  0.050.

Administration of B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 decreased the energy intake in HFD mice close to control values p  0.050 as previously reported .Obesity-Induced Alterations in Serum Metabolic Parameters and Leptin and Glucocorticoid Receptors Are Ameliorated by B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765in Obese MiceObese mice showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of leptin p  0.001 Fig.

Furthermore the bifidobacterial strain reduced the obesity-induced upregulation of TLR2 protein or gene expres- sion in the intestine p  0.010 and the hippocampus p  0.050 and restored the alterations of 5-HT levels in the hippocampus p  0.050 which could contribute to attenuating the obesity-associated depressive-like behavior p  0.050.

d relative to total fat mass was also sig- nificantly reduced to 73.75 mg SEM 7.05 p  0.010 in the HFD-fed group and tended p  0.080 to be increased by the administration of B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765.The mean of total energy intake per mouse on the last week 13th week was higher p  0.05 in HFD mice 55.70 kcal mouse SEM 2.85 than SD mice 40.60 kcalmouse SEM 0.96.

pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 on leptin receptor OB-R mRNA expression in small intestine and hippocampus Fig.b c. The OB-R mRNA levels were significantly decreased in small intestine p  0.050 and hippocampus p  0.010 in HFD- fed mice compared to SD-fed mice which could explain leptin resistance being characteristic of obesity.

B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 also lowered the obesity-induced increase of TLR2 protein levels in small intestine p  0.010 and tended to do so in the hippocampus p  0.070 Fig.
