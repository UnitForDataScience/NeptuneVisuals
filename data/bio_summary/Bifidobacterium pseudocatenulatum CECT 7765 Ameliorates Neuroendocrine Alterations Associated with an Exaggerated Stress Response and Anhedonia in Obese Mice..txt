the present study aimed to evaluate whether bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cect 7765 could re- verse the neurobehavioral consequences of obesity in a high- fat diet hfd fed mouse model via regulation of the gut- brain axis.

furthermore the bifidobacterial strain reduced the obesity-induced upregulation of tlr2 protein or gene expres- sion in the intestine p  0.010 and the hippocampus p  0.050 and restored the alterations of 5-ht levels in the hippocampus p  0.050 which could contribute to attenuating the obesity-associated depressive-like behavior p  0.050. in summary the results indicate that b. pseudocatenulatum cect 7765 could play a role in depressive behavior comorbid with obesity via regulation of endocrine and immune mediators of the gut-brain axis.keywords obesity .

studies in rodent models of stress also suggest that bifidobacterium strains act as protective dietary factors mainly in childhood rather than in adulthood .the aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cect 7765 in the ad- verse endocrine and neurobehavioral consequences of obesity in adulthood using a hfd-induced obese mouse model.

pseudocatenulatum cect 7765 was isolated from healthy infants and identified by sequencing the amplified 16s rrna gene as previously described and selected on the basis of its anti-inflammatory properties in a macrophage cell line  in animal models of obesity and cirrhosis - and in mac- rophages of cirrhotic patients .bacteria were grown in mrs broth scharlau barcelona spain supplemented with 0.05 wv cysteine mrs-c sigma st. louis mo and incubated at 37 degc for 24 h under anaerobic conditions anaerogen oxoid basingstoke uk.
