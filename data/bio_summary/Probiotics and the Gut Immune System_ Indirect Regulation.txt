Although the cause-effect relationship between pathology and gut microflora is not yet well established consumption of specific probiotics may rep- resent a powerful tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health.

The first explores the effect that probiotic have on the gut epithelial barrier and in particular the tight junctions the second focuses on bacteria that by communicating with the intestinal epithe- lium may alter the properties of the mucus layer while the third describes the antimicrobial molecules that specific bac- teria strains use to compete within the gut ecosystems.The GIT epithelium represents a physical barrier between external environment and host immune system.

Pretreatment of the human intestinal epithelial cell lines HT29 and Caco-2 with Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 for example main- tained the phosphorylation levels of ZO-1 occludin and actinin when the cellular models were exposed to infections by Escherichia coli 029NM .Probiotics Modulating the Properties of the Mucus LayerThe intestinal epithelium is covered by a viscoelastic mucus layer whose main functions are to a build a protective barrier against the harsh luminal environment containing digestive enzymes b facilitate food passage and c avoid firm ad- hesion of bacteria to the epithelial cells thus preventing their entry into the lamina propria   .

When the expression or localization of the TJ proteins is altered the functionality of this physical barrier is compro-mised and the leaky gut condition may develop .The leaky gut is characterized by having an epithelium with increased permeability to moleculescompounds that diffuse from the lumen to the lamina propria.

Also in this case using a mouse model for type 2 diabetes the authors describe multiple beneficial effects associated with administration of A. muciniphyla including control of inflam- mation gut barrier and gut peptide secretion mediated by endocannabinoids regulation .ConclusionsIn conclusion modulation of the immune response associated with consumption of specific probiotics may occur not only via the innate and adaptive immune system but also via a regula- tion of the intestinal epithelium permeability b mucus secre- tion and c competition within bacterial ecosystem via secretion of antimicrobial compounds.

In the lumen and upper part of the mucus layer this organ hosts an enormous number of microorganisms whose composition affects the functions of the epithelial barrier and the gut immune system.

Among others probiotics have immunomodulatory properties that usually act directly bya increasing the activity of macrophages or natural killer cells b modulating the secretion of immunoglobulins or cytokines or indirectly by c enhancing the gut epithelial barrier d altering the mucus secretion and e compet- itive exclusion of other pathogenic bacteria.

Particularly we describe here the mechanisms through which specific probiotics enhance the gut epithelial barrier and modulate mucus production.

The first mechanism focuses on the effects produced by specific probiotic strains on the gut epithelial bar- rier the second on mucus secretion and its modulation and the third explores the antimicrobial properties of specific bacteria probiotics and not.
