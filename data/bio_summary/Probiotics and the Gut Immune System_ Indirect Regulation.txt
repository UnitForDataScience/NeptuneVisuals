Although the cause-effect relationship between pathology and gut microflora is not yet well established consumption of specific probiotics may rep- resent a powerful tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health.

The first explores the effect that probiotic have on the gut epithelial barrier and in particular the tight junctions the second focuses on bacteria that by communicating with the intestinal epithe- lium may alter the properties of the mucus layer while the third describes the antimicrobial molecules that specific bac- teria strains use to compete within the gut ecosystems.The GIT epithelium represents a physical barrier between external environment and host immune system.

Pretreatment of the human intestinal epithelial cell lines HT29 and Caco-2 with Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 for example main- tained the phosphorylation levels of ZO-1 occludin and actinin when the cellular models were exposed to infections by Escherichia coli 029NM .Probiotics Modulating the Properties of the Mucus LayerThe intestinal epithelium is covered by a viscoelastic mucus layer whose main functions are to a build a protective barrier against the harsh luminal environment containing digestive enzymes b facilitate food passage and c avoid firm ad- hesion of bacteria to the epithelial cells thus preventing their entry into the lamina propria   .
