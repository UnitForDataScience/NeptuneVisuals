the studies indicated here highlighted the importance of proteins like zo-1 and occludin whose expression is regulated by specific bacteria such as escherichia coli nissle 1917 lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and lactobacillus casei strain dn- 114001    .

leaky gut is responsible for the development of multiple pathological conditions such as irritable bowel disease ibd irritable bowel syndrome ibs and celiac dis- ease  all characterized by sustained inflammation and tissue damage.multiple compounds in the diet have already been demon- strated to regulate the expression of the tj proteins  and similarly probiotics also may regulate the expression localization of these proteins table .to study the effect of escherichia coli nissle 1917 ecn in vivo healthy germ-free mice were colonized with this pro- biotic and the gene expression in their intestinal epithelial cells iecs was analyzed .

these mechanisms can be easily assessed in in vitro setting and therefore represent valid tools to study the properties of newly discovered bacteria strains.compliance with ethical standardsconflict of interest all authors are employee of dsm nutritional products.open access this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4 .0 international license http creativecommons.orglicensesby4.0 which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appro- priate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.referencesanderson rc cookson al mcnabb wc park z mccann mj kelly wj roy nc 2010 lactobacillus plantarum mb452 enhances the function of the intestinal barrier by increasing the expression levels of genes involved in tight junction formation.

an increased expression of the zo-1 and occludin genes was also observed for lactobacillus plantarum strain wcfs1  and lactobacillus plantarum strain cgmcc no.1258 .

in particular the host im- mune system is responsible for ensuring a beneficial microbi- ota composition controlling specific bacteria overgrowth but also reacting to pathogenic bacteria or molecules meeting with the intestinal barrier .

they measured the intestinal barrier param- eters in the human tissue and suggested that the activation of the tlr2-dependent pathway is responsible for regulating the expression and distribution of the tj proteins .of note there are probiotic strains modulating tjs func- tions by altering the phosphorylation status of the tj proteins only without altering their gene expression.

altered expression of specific mucins was associated to gastrointestinal diseases such as crohn's disease  and ulcerative colitis  highlighting the importance of these proteins in the git.specific probiotic bacterial strains have been demonstrated to regulate mucin expression therefore influencing the proper- ties of the mucus layer and indirectly regulate the gut immune system.

in multiple in vitro models itwas shown that l. casei gg inhibited the translocation of specific pathogenic bacteria adhering to the receptors of cul- tured enterocytes  and references within via for example an up-regulation of the muc2 gene expression .further evidences supporting the above-mentioned effects were also obtained by other in vitro and in vivo studies.

these molecules may protect the host against infectious bacteria and favor the survival of commen- sal bacteria .

specific studies reported in this work have provided valuable information about the mechanisms by which certain bacteria strains regulate the gene expression of mucins and therefore affect the properties of the mucus layer.
