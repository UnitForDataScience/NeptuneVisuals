The normalized absolute abundances of the genes for each step are given in the respective cells.

The selection of the genes for the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds was based on the proteogenomics-based reconstruction of their catabolism in the denitrifying Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1 78 and the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacula toluolica Tol2 15.

The boxplots depict the log fold changes of the abundances of all genes coding for the enzymes of the anaerobic degradation of phenolic compounds and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway respectively.

AM KT PA DGH and CEV collected the samples from Keri Lake.

AM GV and AS generated and analyzed the sequence data.

AM RR MS and AS conceptualized and wrote the manuscript.
