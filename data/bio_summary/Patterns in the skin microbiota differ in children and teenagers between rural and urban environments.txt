The segregation between living environments is not due to different variances along the land-use gradient for children of different age Levene's test F  0.45 P  0.81 nor differences in sample size X2  3.39 P  0.64.composition of the living environment and age of children clearly influence the composition of skin microbiota.

The signal of environmental land-use around homes in skin microbiota is most promi- nent in toddlers 1-4 years of age while its effect is less pronounced in babies less than a year of age and older children already in school 8 years of age.

Figure c shows that the inter-individual dissimilarities are significantly smaller between sibling- pairs than in other pairs meaning that children share more of their microbiota with their children than with other children.

Interestingly the skin microbiota of symmetrical sites was more similar in rural children than in urban children and S10 except for 14 year-olds for which the intra-individual variation was higher in rural subjects Fig.

While our results corroborate these earlier findings our data also suggests that the amount of within-individual var- iability between arms can depend on the living environment urban children tended to have more dissimilar arms than rural children and S10.

For example urban children are likely to be more frequently engaged in social contacts than rural children diversifying skin microbiota overall.

Young contains children from one to four years old and Old includes children from eight to fourteen years.

The background and lifestyle of study subjects differs considerably across study areas T3 In cities most children live in apartments while in rural areas 86 of children live in single houses information not provided in 3.

Rural children have more contact with natural environments Most rural parents report their children to be in regular contact with dirt and visiting often at least once a week in forests.The average number of bacterial sequences in skin microbiota samples was 84 915 ranging from 6462 to 452 900.

We show that while age is a major factor affecting skin microbial composition theliving environment also discriminates the skin microbiota of rural and urban children.
