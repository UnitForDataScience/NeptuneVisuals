The oral administration of antibiotics normalized the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and blood pressure in hypertensive rats .The impact of gut microbiota on the blood pressure regu- lation is also be partially explained by the generation of short chain fatty acids.

Gut hormones autonomic nerveactivity and dietary factors play important roles in the regula- tion of vascular function or blood pressure.The Effect of Gut Hormones on Blood Pressure RegulationIn recent years studies have demonstrated that several gut hor- mones participate in the regulation of vascular function and blood pressure .

Emerging findings demonstrate that en- dogenous factors derived from GI including gut hormones autonomic nerve and gut microbiota play important roles in the regulation of vascular function andor blood pressure.

Endogenous factors in GI such as gut hormones GI nerve activity and gut microbiota also have been shown to have potential effects on blood pressure regulation - .

In re- cent years different vagal modulations including baroreflex ac- tivation therapy renal sympathetic denervation and direct vagal nerve stimulation have been used to control blood pressure in the treatment of resistant hypertension .The Effect of Intestinal Nutrient Absorption on Blood Pressure RegulationMany dietary factors affect blood pressure.

On the basis of current knowledge a diet containing low salt below 6 g per day and saturated fat with a high proportion of vegetables fruits and dairy products help to reduce blood pressure and the risk of hypertension as well as attenuate the increase in blood pressure with age .

Renal sympathetic denervation effect on ambulatory blood pressure and blood pressure variability in patients with treatment-resistant hyper- tension.

Gut microbiota is able to influence the generation of vasoactive hormones such as serotonin dopamine and nor- epinephrine which can regulate blood pressure .Diet is a major factor that modifies the composition and function of gut microbiota .

These results suggest that in addition to the weight loss metabolic surgery inducedTable 1 Efficacy of metabolic surgery on hypertensionResolved Resolved or Improved management 58 reduction of blood pressure might be achieved by other mechanisms.The duodeno-jejunal bypass in gastric bypass elimi- nates the physiological responses of duodenal gut hor- mones and related enzymes secretion such as glucagon CCK and bilio-pancreatic enzymes.

These gut hormones have been documented to play important roles in the regulation of cardiometabolic homeostasis.The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is involved in cou- pling changes in body weight to changes in blood pressure .
