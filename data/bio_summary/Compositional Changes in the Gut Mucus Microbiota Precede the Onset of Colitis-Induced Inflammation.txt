Expression of IFN-g was absent in WT and mdr1a22 mice at 6 weeks and in 18-week-old WT mice however its levels were increased in the subset of mdr1a22 mice at 18 weeks of age that also showed indication of histological inflammation see Fig.

B Principal component analysis plot of fingerprinting data of fecal and mucus-associated microbiota from WT and mdr1a22 mice n 7-8group showing differential clustering of mucus microbiota from WT and mdr1a22 mice but no clear clustering in stool bacteria PERMANOVA P  0.05 for mucus and nonsignificant for stool.

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of these data using Bray-Curtis distances also revealed separation of mucus microbial communities between control and mdr1a22 mice PERMANOVA R2 14 0.293 P 14 0.015 for mucus and R2 14 0.192 P 14 0.021 for stools no difference in group variance.The abundance of Gram-positive bacteria was much higher only in mdr1a22 mice compared with the levels of Gram- negative bacteria in the mucus at 18 weeks Fig.

Thus there was an association between mdr1a22 mice that presented with a higher colitis score and elevated levels of Gram-negative bacteria.Overall 18-week-old mdr1a22 mice harbored similar numbers of mucus and stool bacteria Fig.

Although Clostridiales were similar in stool samples from WT and 18-week-old mdr1a22 mice in agreement with our sequencing data there was a significant increase P 14 0.0312 in Clostridiales in older mdr1a22 mice see Fig.

D and E Significant community shifts were associated with progression to inflammation in mdr1a22 mice compared with healthy WT and disease-free mdr1a22 mice.

A Principal component analysis plot of stool and mucus samples based on fingerprinting data from WT and mdr1a22 mice at 18 weeks n 4-6group showing differential clustering of stool microbial communities in mdr1a22 animals with no inflammation compared with age-matched mdr1a22 with inflammation.

Our objective was to investigate both temporal and spatial changes in colonic microbiota communities preceding the onset of colitis.Methods We studied mucus and stool microbiota using a spontaneous model of colitis the mdr1a22 mouse and their respective wild-type littermate controls in a time series mode.Results Using this approach we have shown that microbial dysbiosis was evident in the mucus but not stools with reduced abundance of Clostridiales evident in the mucus but not stools of colitis-prone mice mdr1a22- mice 12 weeks before the onset of detectable inflammation.

In contrast the relative abundance of Clostridiales in the mucus tended to be reduced in the mdr1a22 mice at 6 weeks of age compared with age-matched WT mice see Fig.
