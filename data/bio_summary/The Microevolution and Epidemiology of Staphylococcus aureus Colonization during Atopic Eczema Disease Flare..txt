Examination of intra-host genetic heterogeneity of the colonizing S. aureus pop- ulations identified evidence of within-host selection in the AE patients with AE variants being potentially selectively advantageous for intracellular persistence and treatment resistance.Journal of Investigative Dermatology 2018 138 336e343 INTRODUCTIONClinical studies have shown a link between Staphylococcus aureus and the pathogenesis of atopic eczema AE.

Although providing a more holistic overview of microbial population structure in AE current metagenomic approaches have thus far failed to resolve the fine-scale population dynamics of S. aureus in AE or the genetic changes occurring in the colonizing population of this versatile pathogen.Whole-genome sequencing is a high-resolution genotyping tool that can be used to study within-host evolution and transmission.

The levels of diversity we observed in both patients and control partic- ipants were comparable to those of previous studies exam- ining the in-host population diversity of S. aureus during carriage maximum pairwise SNP distance differentiating colonies from AE cases was 26 and in controls was 17 .In AE cases where nasal colonization was detected col- onies derived from skin and nasal sites were interspersedFigure 2.

The convergent evolution of mutations in this key regulator is evidence of a strong selective pressure favoring reduced virulence in this population.DISCUSSIONDeep sequencing has allowed an unprecedented view of the microevolutionary changes occurring during carriage in AE with evidence of selection for specific strain backgrounds colonizing AE skin.

In the future serially sampling AE patients and their family members would enable us to assess the impact that selective sweeps and transmission bottlenecks have on shaping the diversity we observe in AE colonization.From the most mature colonization populations we uncovered clear evidence of selection shaping the pop- ulations providing insights into mechanisms of bacterial persistence and other potential origins of the clonally expanded populations in these individuals.

A characteristic of atopic eczema AE is colonization by S. aureus with exacerbations associated with an increased bacterial burden of the organism.

Despite this the origins and genetic diversity of S. aureus colo- nizing individual patients during AE disease flares is poorly understood.

aureus colonization we deep sequenced S. aureus populations from nine children with moderate to severe AE and 18 non-atopic children asymptomatically carrying S. aureus nasally.

Colonization by clonal S. aureus populations was observed in both AE patients and control participants with all but one of the individuals carrying colonies belonging to a single sequence type.

There was a significant difference in the genetic backgrounds of S. aureus colonizing AE cases versus controls Fisher exact test P 0.03.
