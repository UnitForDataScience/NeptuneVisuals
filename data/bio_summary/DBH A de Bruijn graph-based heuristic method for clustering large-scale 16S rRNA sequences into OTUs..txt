From the NMI curves we can see that all methods achieved higher NMI values near 97 threshold and DBH has the highest NMI value.

And our DBH also has the ability of handling large datasets.DiscussionConsidering the fact that de Bruijn graph representations of similar sequences in a cluster contain more information than a sin- gle seed sequence reported by traditional heuristic OTUs cluster- ing methods in this work we developed a novel DB-based heuris- tic clustering method namely DBH to bin huge amounts of 16S rRNA gene sequences into OTUs by introducing a new seeds selec- tion strategy and simultaneously considering the sequence errors.

Compared with hierarchical clustering and heuristic algorithms the model- based clustering methods bypass the selection of a constant dis- tance threshold and achieve better clustering quality but they do not perform well on large-scale datasets and may have high com- putational burden.Hierarchical clustering methods either based on average linage or complete linkage need to build a whole distance matrix of all the sequences which adds the computational burden and mem- ory usage.

A flowchart showing the OTUs generating process with DBH.DBH algorithmThe main motivation of our DBH method is to overcome the sensitivity of seed selection which is a main problem in traditional heuristic clustering methods as well as to reduce the large mem- ory usage of hierarchical clustering methods for huge 16S rRNA sequences.

The number of OTUs achieved in different error rate is shown in  from which it can be evidently observed that DBH can facilitate theTable 2NMI scores of five methods at 95 similarity levels with different error rates.Table 3The average and SD standard deviation of NMI values for five algorithms on 10 randomly order changed V2 data.The number in the parenthesis is SD and the species assignments are used as the ground truths to compute NMI.overestimation of OTUs number with higher error rate compared to other methods.Experiment 2 V2 dataset of human gutIn this section one massive real-world sequence dataset V2 was used to evaluate the performance of five methods.

As can be seen from a our DBH has the best NMI val- ues than other four methods and ESPRIT-Tree also achieved higher NMI scores than Uclust CD-HIT and DySC.
