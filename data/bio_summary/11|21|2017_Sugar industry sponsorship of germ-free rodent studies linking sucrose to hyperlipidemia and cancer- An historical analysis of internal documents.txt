we could not identify any pub- lished results.a march 1974 isrf report includes its internal interpretation of project 259's resultsobservations showed significant increase in serum triglyceride level with rats having con- ventional microbiota on sucrose diets whereas a decreasing effect was noted with germ- free rats suggesting the triglycerides were formed from fatty acids produced in the small intestine by the fermentation of sucrose .isrf's summary of project 259 confirms that the sugar industry interpreted the results as indicating that intestinal bacteria had a role in sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemia in rats.implicationsdespite limited available detail about project 259's study design it appears that isrf did not terminate funding because of concerns about the quality of the study.

indeed isrf's internal reports show how isrf interpreted the results biological differences between sucrose- and starch-fed rats were demonstrated  and a mechanism by which sucrose caused triglyceride formation was suggested .based on isrf's interpretation of preliminary results extending project 259's funding would have been unfavorable to the sugar industry's commercial interests.

the lan- guage in pover's report suggests he was confident that project 259 taken to completion would confirm the causal role of gut microbiota in the differential effects of sucrose and starch on serum triglycerides in rats.isrf terminates project 259 fundingon september 10 1970 as part of a strategic assessment of industry research conducted during the transition from srf to isrf hickson reported to industry executives on the contribution of srf's research projects to elicit useful and significant information to the sugar industry .

using the same methodology and internal document sources see  this paper presents data that suggest that in 1970 srf withheld information from the public that the microbiome may be an important contributing factor to sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemia and that sucrose consumption compared to starch might be associated with bladder cancer.the sugar association a united states sucrose industry trade association  which has organizational ties to srf the international sugar research foundation isrf and isrf's successor the world sugar research organisation based in london uk  has consistently denied - that sucrose has any metabolic effects related to chronic disease beyond its caloric effects.

isrf's decision to terminate project 259's funding was also consistent with srf's earlier efforts to cast doubt on the chd risks of sucrose .in addition publication of results suggesting an association between sucrose consumption and bladder cancer would likely have had further adverse regulatory implications to the sugar industry.

isrf international sugar research foundation.project 259 links the microbiome to sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemiain august 1970 pover reported to isrf that the main germ-free experiment had achieved promising results there has been a sharp decrease in serum triglyceride of germfree rats fed a high sugar diet there is no overlap with the serum triglyceride figures from rats fed the basic p.r.m.

this incidental finding of project 259 demonstrated to srf that sucrose versus starch consumption caused different metabolic effects and suggested that sucrose by stimulat- ing urinary beta-glucuronidase may have a role in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer.experimental design for project 259 and results reported to isrf.

knowing that additional funding was not forthcoming from isrf according to isrf's 1969-1970 annual report of research dr pover had expressed hopes to isrf of obtain- ing continuing support from other sources .

isrf's june 1969 site visit to pover's laboratory suggests that isrf was informed of and perhaps had input into thestudy design.

had isrf disclosed project 259's findings it is likely that sucrose would have received scrutiny as a potential carcinogen.

regardless of what actually happened these events would have occurred after isrf's decision to terminate funding and would therefore not have informed isrf's decision to ter- minate funding shortly before the data collection phase of the project was complete.

when the antibiotic sulfasuxidene was added to similar diets the serum cholesterol level of the starch-fed rats rose while in sucrose-fed rats it did not  leading the nejm review to report dietary influence on the intestinal microbiota was therefore sug- gested .in correspondence with nejm review author d. mark hegsted in 1965 srf vice president of research john hickson posited that the differential effects of sucrose and starch on serum cholesterol might be explained by differences in the bacterial synthesis of thiamine in the intes- tine .

because isrf knew that pover did not have a new funder lined up  it is plausible to believe that isrf thought that terminating project 259's funding would prevent completion of the project and publication of results that were potentially damaging to the sugar industry.our analysis also identifies several lines of inquiry active in the 1960s about the health effects of added sugars which may warrant further investigation today.
