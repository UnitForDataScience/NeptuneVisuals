The lan- guage in Pover's report suggests he was confident that Project 259 taken to completion would confirm the causal role of gut microbiota in the differential effects of sucrose and starch on serum triglycerides in rats.ISRF terminates Project 259 fundingOn September 10 1970 as part of a strategic assessment of industry research conducted during the transition from SRF to ISRF Hickson reported to industry executives on the contribution of SRF's research projects to elicit useful and significant information to the sugar industry .

We could not identify any pub- lished results.A March 1974 ISRF report includes its internal interpretation of Project 259's resultsObservations showed significant increase in serum triglyceride level with rats having con- ventional microbiota on sucrose diets whereas a decreasing effect was noted with germ- free rats suggesting the triglycerides were formed from fatty acids produced in the small intestine by the fermentation of sucrose .ISRF's summary of Project 259 confirms that the sugar industry interpreted the results as indicating that intestinal bacteria had a role in sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemia in rats.ImplicationsDespite limited available detail about Project 259's study design it appears that ISRF did not terminate funding because of concerns about the quality of the study.

When the antibiotic sulfasuxidene was added to similar diets the serum cholesterol level of the starch-fed rats rose while in sucrose-fed rats it did not  leading the NEJM review to report dietary influence on the intestinal microbiota was therefore sug- gested .In correspondence with NEJM review author D. Mark Hegsted in 1965 SRF Vice President of Research John Hickson posited that the differential effects of sucrose and starch on serum cholesterol might be explained by differences in the bacterial synthesis of thiamine in the intes- tine .

ISRF International Sugar Research Foundation.Project 259 links the microbiome to sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemiaIn August 1970 Pover reported to ISRF that the main germ-free experiment had achieved promising results There has been a sharp decrease in serum triglyceride of germfree rats fed a high sugar diet there is no overlap with the serum triglyceride figures from rats fed the basic P.R.M.

Using the same methodology and internal document sources see  this paper presents data that suggest that in 1970 SRF withheld information from the public that the microbiome may be an important contributing factor to sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemia and that sucrose consumption compared to starch might be associated with bladder cancer.The Sugar Association a United States sucrose industry trade association  which has organizational ties to SRF the International Sugar Research Foundation ISRF and ISRF's successor the World Sugar Research Organisation based in London UK  has consistently denied - that sucrose has any metabolic effects related to chronic disease beyond its caloric effects.

Project 259 found a statistically significant decrease in serum triglycerides in germ-free rats fed a high sugar diet compared to conventional rats fed a basic PRM diet a pelleted diet containing cereal meals soybean meals whitefish meal and dried yeast fortified with a balanced vitamin supplement and trace element mix- ture.

Studies funded by the food and beverage industry or conducted by authors with food and beverage industry conflicts of interest have been critical of evidence indicating that fructose has unique metabolic effects while those without such conflicts reach an opposite conclusion -.

In contrast this paper provides empirical data sug- gesting that the sugar industry terminated funding of an animal study that was finding unfa- vorable results with respect to the association between dietary sugars and cancer with possible translational importance to humans.Our study contributes to a wider body of literature documenting industry manipulation of science.

The NEJM review  reported that starch-fed rats had significantly higher biliary excretion of bile acids  and lower serum cholesterol levels  than sucrose-fed rats.
