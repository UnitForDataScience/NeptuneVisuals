The dysregulated lipid phenotype of Gliadin mice did not manifest in the tri- glyceride profile Supplementary Table S2 or in the expression levels of a series of lipid metabolism related genes in the liver nor in the levels of alanine aminotransferase in plasma Supplementary Fig.

Characterization of the inflammatory phenotype of the liver immune cell subsets through intracellular cytokine staining did not show any differences in immune cell activities between the two groups Supplementary Table S4.Within eWAT the numbers of several of the immune cell subsets tended to be influenced by gliadin Supplementary Fig.

Expression of gut barrier function related genes was determined by SYBR green based real time PCR Supplementary Table S5 and the remaining analy- ses were based on Taqman primers and probes Supplementary Table S6.
