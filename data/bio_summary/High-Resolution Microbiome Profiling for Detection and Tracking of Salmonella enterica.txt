However using linear regression the maximum predicted false positive rate was only 0.11 given a completely homogenous community comprised entirely of E. coli .Moreover in silico simulations in which sequencing reads are composed entirely of Enterobacteriaceae 16S rRNA gene sequences and no background flora utilizing artificial reads from two amplicon regions V1 - V3 and V3 - V4 of the 16S rRNA gene from pure isolates of 15 different Enterobacteriaceae members indicate that false positive rates for Salmonella detection approach 0.2 when closely related members such as Citrobacter and Enterobacter spp.

The relative abundance of Enterococcus and Pediococcus also significantly increased from un-enriched to enriched time point samples .TABLE 1  Salmonella enterica false positive rates for V1-V3 and V3-V4 16S rRNA amplicon regions.Due to the intrinsic noise of 16S rRNA-based community profiling investigators are forced to choose a minimum abundance threshold defined as the percentage of reads assigned to S. enterica in a sample to determine the outcome of a diagnostic assignment presenceabsence.

Merged reads and any unmerged Read 1 sequences were then screened for 16S rRNA fragments using Bowtie2   against a broad database of 16S rRNA sequences.

This approach was used to account for difference in 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing strategies.Evaluation of S. enterica False Positive RateAn evaluation of the false positive rate of Resphera Insight to accurately detect S. enterica was performed using 16S rRNA amplicon datasets reflecting raw milk cheese samples spiked with variable levels of Escherichia coli O157H7 or O103.

Patients with fewer than 500 final sequences per duplicate MiSeq run were removed from analysis.RESULTSAccuracy for S. enterica IdentificationWe assessed how performance of three 16S rRNA signature identification algorithms Insight RDP and UCLUST changed according to changing sequencing read length and 16S rRNA gene position.

We obtained and reprocessed the original 16S rRNA amplicon sequences from two replicate MiSeq runs Run1 and Run2 requiring that passing samples have at least 500 high-quality 16S rRNA sequences in both runs after removal of bacterial contaminants identified in negative controls see Materials and Methods.

We also demonstrate the utility of this approach to detect Salmonella in the clinical setting in this case bloodborne infections.Keywords 16S rRNA community profiling microbiome Salmonella metagenomicsINTRODUCTIONSalmonella infection is a common bacterial disease throughout the developed and developing world causing considerable morbidity and mortality.

For example if a 16S fragment is ambiguous between S. enterica and S. bongori the algorithm will provide the assignment SalmonellabongoriSalmonellaenterica.Here our statistic of performance sensitivity is the Diagnostic True Positive rate DTP defined as the percentage of 16S rRNA sequences that were correctly and unambiguously assigned toS.

While this method is reliable for higher taxonomic levels species-level inference with 16S rRNA gene sequencing has remained a significant challenge particularly for accurate identification of Salmonella enterica and other enteric pathogens.

Previously we evaluated the performance of Resphera Insight a high-resolution 16S rRNA sequence analysis pipeline for identification of Listeriatracking of S. enterica in a modified US FDA BAM protocol for detection of Salmonella through reduced enrichment   .
