The covariances between leaf bacterial diversity and the two variables of leaf bacterial community composition were also included in the model.Extended Data Figure 6  Structural equation model of plant diversity and identity explaining leaf bacterial diversity and community composition as well as plant community productivity.

Here we show that plant-associated microbial diversity is posi- tively related to plant community productivity explaining a portion of the variation in productivity that would otherwise have been attributed to plant diversity and functional traits both adding to the explanatory power of the model of plot productivity and mediating the tree diversity- identity effect on productivity.Our finding that leaf bacterial diversity but not community com- position is related to plant community productivity suggests that the effect of bacterial diversity on plant productivity is more likely to be a complementarity effect rather than a selection effect.

Despite their potential impor- tance in mediating plant biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships the role of microbial communities in driving ecosystem productivity and function has never been evaluated in an experimental context that allows direct quantification of the association between plant-associated microbes and ecosystem function.In this study we quantified the relationships among leaf bacterial diversity plant species richness plant functional diversity and iden- tity and plant community productivity in a biodiversity-ecosystem function experiment with trees.

Removing the link between leaf bacterial diversity and community productivity in the structural equation model yielded an unstable model kh2  11.906 P  0.008 providing further evidence for theFigure 2  Structural equation model of plant diversity and identity explaining leaf bacterial diversity and plant community productivity.

We hypothesized that 1 host species identity and functional diversity will be the strongest driver of leaf bacterial community structure and diversity on individual trees and 2 a higher leaf bacterial diversity will be positively linked to plant community productivity.

The model formula isleaf diversity  host species identity  functional diversity  functional identity1blockplotwhere fixed effects included leaf bacterial diversity functional diversity and func- tional identity as continuous variables and host species identity as a 19 levels factor.At the plot level we built a structural equation model to test for the direct and indirect effects of host tree identity and diversity on leaf bacterial diversity and plant community productivity and .

To address the challenge of controlling for changes in leaf bacterial community composition at different bacterial community diversities we quantified leaf bacterial community structure by using the two axes of a non-metric multi- dimensional scaling NMDS analysis on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of the OTU community matrix.
