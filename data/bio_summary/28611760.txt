the 131 milk samples excluding two samples which had no data of their body weight were stratified by maternal bmi into three groups i18.5 n12 ii 18.5-25.0 n87 and iii 25.0 n32.there were no significant differences in the abundances of the 17 most predominant bacterial families among the samples collected from these three different bmi groups data not shown.global differences in breast milk bacterial communities among women living in taiwan and mainland chinawe obtained a total of 746312 high-quality filtered reads or 5611.44141.5 reads per participant.

the 10 predominant families detected were streptococcaceae mean relative abundance 24.4 pseudo- monadaceae 14.0 staphylococcaceae 12.2 lactobacillaceae6.2 oxalobacteraceae 4.8 enterobacteriaceae 4.5sinobacteriaceae 3.1 micrococcaceae 3.0 propionibac- teriaceae 2.4 and comamonadaceae 2.4. the abundance of pseudomonadaceae 4.6 was significantly lower in samples from taiwan than in those from east p  0.01 central p  0.001 and northeast p  0.05 china whereas the abundance of staphylococcaceae 27.9 was significantly higher in samples from taiwan than in those from east china p  0.01 and central china p  0.05. the abundance of pseudomonadaceae 23.1 was significantly higher p  0.05 in samples from central china than in those from north and southwest china.identification of three clustersby using pca we decomposed the data on bacterial families into two factors that explained 67.5 of the variance .

the microbiota in cluster 3 samples showed significantly higher pd whole-tree and chao1 diversity indices than those in cluster 1 samples p  0.05 and cluster 2 samples p  0.001 .a total of 2290 otus including 86 species were ascribed to cluster 1 we ascribed 2923 otus including 91 species to cluster 2 and 2712 otus including 92 species to cluster 3 and 1512 otus including 77 species were common to the three clusters.

we profiled the microbiota in breast milk samples collected from healthy mothers in taiwan and mainland china by using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing.materials and methodssample collection and processinga total of 133 mothers living in taiwan and six regions of mainland china who had delivered within a year provided milk samples supplementary table s1.

milk samples 6 ml were mixed with 6 ml rna stabilization solution rnalater ambion inc. austin tx united states for dna extraction.samples were stored in sterile plastic tubes at 4c until deliveryto the laboratory within 1 h after collection and then at 70c until dna extraction.dna extractionbacterial dna was extracted from samples by using the bead- beating method and purified as described previously    with slight modification.

samples from southwest china were also distributed in the pc2-positive region p  0.05 vs. east and central china.we examined the clustering of all samples by using pcoa with the pam clustering algorithm supplementary table s1 the optimum cluster number at the family level was three with a silhouette width of 0.22 and a prediction strength of0.71  and supplementary table s4.

shows clustering of the samples from taiwan whereas the samples from mainland china exhibited a more dispersed distribution.

the abundance of l. rhamnosus in cluster 1 samples was significantly higher than those in cluster 2.impact of lactation stage and bmi on relative abundances of bacterial components in breast milkthere were no significant differences in lactation stage at which samples were taken among the seven geographical regions threefigure 5  bacterial networks of the breast milk microbiome.

to analyze the impact of lactation stage on breast milk microbiota the 133 milk samples were stratified by lactation stage into three groups i less than 3 months n 28 ii 3-6 months n 50 and iii more than 6 months n 55. there were no significant differences in the abundances of the 17 most predominant bacterial families among samples collected at the three different lactation stages supplementary table s11.effect of delivery mode on relative abundances of bacterial components in breast milkto examine whether the delivery mode vaginal vs. cesarean affected the breast milk microbiota we compared the relative abundances of different bacterial families or genera in thesetwo groups.

higher abundances of leuconostocaceae predominant genus leuconostoc and lower abundances of carnobacteriaceae carnobacterium and moraxellaceae acinetobacter have been observed in samples from mothers who have delivered vaginally than in samples from women who have delivered by c-section  .

greater bacterial diversity and richness in particular more bifidobacterium species have been found in samples from mothers who have delivered by c-section and fewer staphylococcus species in samples from mothers who have delivered vaginally  .

the numbers of milk samples collected among the seven regions were inconsistent ranged from seven to 34 samples.

we profiled the microbiota in breast milk samples collected from 133 healthy mothers in taiwan and in six regions of mainland china central east north northeast south and southwest china by using 16s rrna pyrosequencing.

bacterial composition at the family level differed significantly among samples from the seven geographical regions.
