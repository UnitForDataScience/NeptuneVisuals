Moreover blood microbiota in healthy participants should also be con- sidered to exclude those commensal bacteria in the blood.In conclusion blood microbiota analysis can be influenced by various factors including the origin of the condition.

5 2017CORRESPONDENCEBlood Microbiota as a Potential Noninvasive Diagnostic Biomarker for Liver Fibrosis in Severely ObesePatients Choose Carefully TO THE EDITORWe read with great interest the recent article by Lelouvier et al.1 who investigated the relationship between liver fibrosis in patients with severe obesity and blood microbiota.

The gut may be the major origin of blood micro- biota however an oral source for blood microbiota cannot be ignored.

Koren et al.2 suggested that the atherosclerotic plaque microbiota may at least in part be derived from the oral cavity.

As an important risk factor for periodontal disease obesity may also con- tribute to bacterial translocation from the oral cavity to the blood and participate in shaping the blood microbiota.

Without excluding oral disease in the enrolled participants a reliable correlation between blood microbiota and liver fibrosis cannot be estab- lished because specific bacterial signatures may also exist in patients with oral diseases but without liver fibrosis.

Studying oral microbiota in addition to gut and blood micro- biota may help clarify the role of key functional bac- teria in liver fibrosis.

In addition bacterial fragments in blood cannot be equated with blood microbiota which can be easily detected using sequencing techniques.However the read numbers for each sample were not reported in the Lelouvier et al.1 study.

Principal coordinates analysis can pro- vide interindividual variations intuitively whereas Good's coverage estimator can evaluate the sequencing depth for blood microbiota.

The operational taxo- nomic unit number and the overall composition in dif- ferent taxonomic levels should also be provided to interpret the bacterial richness of blood microbiota and its taxonomic differences.
