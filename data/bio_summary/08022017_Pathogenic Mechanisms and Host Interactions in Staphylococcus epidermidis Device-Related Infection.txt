Much less is known regarding direct interaction of S. epidermidis and osteoclasts although it is expected that induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines will enhance bone destruction in similar ways.Given the multitude of different effects of S. aureus on osteoblast and osteoclast function it is likely that S. epidermidis can also negatively affect the capacity of osteoblasts to produce bone matrix andor enhance osteoclast formation and function although much further work is necessary to clarify if this is indeed the case.Lastly the interaction of S. epidermidis with bone cells could provide a location where bacteria can persist and prolong ODRIs.

However this immune evasion mechanism may be of more importance for S. aureus rather than S. epidermidis per se since the capacity of S. epidermidis for invading osteoblasts in vitro does not appear to differ between commensal strains and clinical isolates of S. epidermidis obtained from infected orthopedic devices Valour et al.

Furthermore the differences between S. aureus and S. epidermidis are quite significant and so further work focused on S. epidermidis is required to provide a proper understanding of adaptive immune responses to S. epidermidis bone infection.SUMMARY AND OUTLOOKS.

Overall despite differences due to different S. epidermidis strains and its effect in different tissues it can be hypothesized that lower induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines together with high IL-10 production can contribute to the sub-acute nature of S. epidermidis infections.Multiple chemokines are also released upon S. epidermidis infection.

The application and integration of this data for S. epidermidis commensalism will provide a much better understanding of the roles of S. epidermidis in health and also in certain skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis.Upon a transition to a pathogenic interaction with the host as occurs in DRI the same mechanisms that allow S. epidermidis to reside in human skin and mucosal tissues allow adhesion and biofilm formation upon the implanted device.

This represents a potentially new pathogenic mechanism for S. epidermidis and a location where bacteria could survive to cause persistentrelapsing infections however its relevance in vivo has not yet been proven.HOST INTERACTION WITH S. epidermidisThe interaction between S. epidermidis as a commensal with the host immune system is thought to play a role in the development of immunological tolerance.

Taken together this suggests that while the persistence of orthopedic implant-associated S. aureus infections in vivo may well stem from its enhanced ability to invade osteoblasts and potentially osteoclasts other mechanisms such as biofilm formation may underlie the persistence of S. epidermidis in implant-related infection.Finally the integration of immune responses within the bone system in the context of S. epidermidis infection has been largely unexplored.

With the increasing use of such devices coupled with high antibiotic resistance rates S. epidermidis DRI will likely remain a clinical problem for generations to come.This review describes host interactions with S. epidermidis under both healthy commensal conditions and under conditions of an invasive DRI.
