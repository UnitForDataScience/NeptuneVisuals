This variant exhibited robust repression of GUS activity in E. coli cells indicating that specific contacts in the E. coli GUS operon were formed with this mutant of SeGusR to block GUS expression in cells Fig.

As shown here only the Enterobacteriaceae including several opportunistic bacterial pathogens contain a GUS operon and GusR.bases of the interaction between GusR and the operator DNA as well as the binding of glucuronides to GusR have remained undefined.Here we describe the crystal structures of two Enterobacteriaceae GusR proteins from E. coli and from S. enterica and outline the DNA binding characteristics of E. coli GusR within the regula- tory region of its GUS operon.

The NCBI database contains whole-genome sequences for six strains of E. coli and the genomes of five of these six strains encode full GUS operons by contrast the pathogenic O157H7 strain lacks the gusA gene that encodes the GUS enzyme.

Thus in the presence of suitable glucuro- nides GUS operon-containing Enterobacteriaceae may be poised to use this unique source of carbon for colonization and potential expansion in opportunistic conditions.We find that all microbes encoding a bona fide GusR alsomaintain elements of a GUS operon but not all retain a complete GUS operon composed of gusA gusB and gusC genes.

Here we studied the specificity of E. coli GusR and UxuR interactions with predicted operator sites in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry ITC.We cloned the gene for E. coli UxuR EcUxuR recombinantlyoverexpressed the protein in E. coli and purified it to homoge- neity.

The GusR- specific DNA operator site in the regulatory region of the E. coli GUS operon is identified and structure-guided GusR mutants pin- point the residues essential for DNA binding and glucuronide recog- nition.

In 1987 Blanco reported that the GUS op- eron in E. coli was under the control of GusR and UxuR a second TetR-like repressor that shares 14 sequence identity with EcGusR and that both repressors appeared to bind to two operator elements sites 1 and 2 44.

The GusR binding sites in the regulatory region of the S. enterica GUS operon are not known and we foundthat SeGusR does not bind to operator sites 1 or 2 from the E. coli operon's regulatory region Fig.
