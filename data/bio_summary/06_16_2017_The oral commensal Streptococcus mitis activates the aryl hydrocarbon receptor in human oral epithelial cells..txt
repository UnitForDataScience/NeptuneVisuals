Forfurther study we chose AhR a mediator involved in many biological processes including immunological and inflammatory responses cell differentiation cell adhesion and migration14 and in humans is directly linked to and significantly improves wound healing.20Initially AhR was characterized by its regulation of detoxifying enzymes in response to environmental toxins but this is now thought to be a secondary function since AhR is highly conserved throughout evolution and anthropogenic environmental toxins are a relatively new phenomenon.15 Activation of AhR can be elicited by both exogenous and endogenous ligands.15 In the inactive state AhR is located in the cytoplasm and upon activation it translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator and subsequently interacts with the xenobiotic-dioxin-response element in the promo- tor region of target genes.

Activation and functionality of AhR was confirmed through nuclear translocation determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription analysis of CYP1A1 the hallmark gene for AhR activation.

The concept that the oral commensal microbiota can induce AhR activation is important also in view of the role that AhR has in modulation of T-cell differentiation and as an anti-inflammatory factor in macrophages.International Journal of Oral Science 2017 9 145-150 doi10.1038ijos.2017.17 published online 16 June 2017Keywords aryl hydrocarbon receptor commensal inflammation oral epithelium prostaglandin E2 StreptococcusINTRODUCTIONThe immune system and other organs depend on successful mutualistic interaction with the commensal microbiota for normal development and function.

The observed differences between the elevated PGE2 levels in response to S. mitis relative to unstimulated cells and between the reduced PGE2 levels by AhR inhibitor relative to S. mitis alone were both statistically significant Po0.05.Figure 1 S. mitis activates AhR in oral epithelial cells.

By contrast neither S. gordonii normutans induced increased transcription of CYP1A1 after incubationwith human primary keratinocytes indicating that AhR activation is a species-specific characteristic limited to restricted types of oral commensals including S. mitis.We next examined the effect of S. mitis on the expression of three AhR target genes in oral keratinocytes CXCL1 CXCL2 and CXCL8 chemokines that are important in recruitment of granulocytes and to initiate inflammation.

Among the AA metabolites prostaglandins are shown to activate AhR but only at levels exceeding that of physiological concentrations.24 Conversely AhR can modulate inflammation by regulating PGE2 as shown in this study and by others.1825 PGE2 is not only a mediator of acute inflammation but has also immunosuppres- sive properties that in the final phases of wound healing contribute to the resolution of inflammation and facilitation of tissue regeneration.26 Differential expression of four highly diverse PGE2 receptors with high- and low-affinity receptors in various types of cells can part explain the divergent effects of PGE2.27-28 Gram-negative G- bacterial species are shown to induce higher amounts of PGE2 compared to Gram-positive G species.29 Epithelial cells current study and monocytes29 exposed to G species S. mitis showed PGE2 levels of  120 and  1 000 pgmL - 1 respectively but both displayed significantly lower levels compared to G- bacterial species 5 000 pgmL - 1.

The concept that the oral commensal microbiota can induce AhR activation is important also in view of the role that AhR has in modulation of T-cell differentiation into Th17 and Treg cells.
