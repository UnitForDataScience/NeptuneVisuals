It is challenging to dissect the contribution of each of these factors to the observed differences in gut microbiota of HF patients in the larger-scale studies.The composition of gut microbiota of older adults is known to be distinct from that of younger adults  and gut microbiota profiles of older people vary substantially between individuals affected by several factors such as diet habitation morbidity and medication .

It remains to be elucidated how gut microbiota changes occurring during aging may affect the host physiological aging process per se  and further investigations including analysis of the composition of gut microbiota of elderly HC subjects without comorbidities will be needed to elucidate the impact of the alter- ations in microbiota in older HF patients.Our study cannot provide evidence for direct causal effects.

In line with the cru- cial link between gut microbiota and the maintenance of host health there is growing evidence that altered composition of gut microbiota known as dysbiosis contributes to the pathogene- sis of host diseases .

Numerous experiments with fecal microbiota transplantation to germ- free animals have suggested that gut microbiota can initiate and influence host diseases such as obesity-related diseases liver diseases inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer .In patients with heart failure HF the structure and function of the gut are altered as a con- sequence of microcirculatory disturbances  .

Mean unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances between gut microbiota of HF patients and HC subjects were 0.750 and 0.432 respectively which were greater than inter-individual UniFrac distances in the gut microbiota of HC subjects 0.722 and 0.383 respectively both p  0.00001  .

How- ever both unweighted and weighted UniFrac analyses demonstrated that the differences in gut microbiota composition between the two groups were larger than inter-individual differences in the gut microbiota of older HF group unweighted UniFrac distance 0.743 - 0.004 vs.0.716 - 0.007 weighted UniFrac distance 0.490 - 0.006 vs. 0.443 - 0.011 both p  0.01  .

p  0.01.were reduced 3.1 - 1.0 vs. 7.5 - 1.4 p  0.021 2.2 - 0.6 vs. 6.2 - 1.3 p  0.013 and- 0.3 vs. 2.3 - 0.6 p  0.035 respectively while the genus Lactobacillus and L. salivar- ius were enriched 21.4 - 5.1 vs. 2.0 - 1.1 p  0.004 and 14.0 - 4.7 vs. 0.4 - 0.4p  0.018 respectively in fecal samples from older HF patients compared to younger patients .DiscussionThis study provides the first evidence to our knowledge that patients with HF harbor altered gut microbiota pointing to the potential clinical significance of gut microbiota in the patho- physiology of HF.In patients with HF there are disturbances in splanchnic microcirculation because of reduced perfusion increased congestion and vasoconstriction caused by neurohumoral acti- vation.

According to a paper that characterized the microbiota composition of 161 subjects aged 65 years and older and 9 younger control subjects in Ireland  the microbiota of the elderly was distinct from that of younger subjects with a greater proportion of the phylum Bacteroi- detes and a less proportion of the phylum Firmicutes.
