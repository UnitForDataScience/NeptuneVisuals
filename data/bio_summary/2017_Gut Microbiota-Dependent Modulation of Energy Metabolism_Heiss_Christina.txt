Furthermore cohousing mice that received a gut microbiota from obese donors with mice that re- ceived a gut microbiota from lean donors led to a reduced increase in adiposity in the mice colonized with the gut microbiota from the obese donors 13.

Interestingly when recipient mice were trans- planted with gut microbiota from lard-fed or fish oil-fed mice and then subsequently fed a lard-based HFD the mice receiving gut microbiota from fish oil-fed mice had reduced weight gain and diminished adipose tissue in- flammation compared to those receiving gut microbiota from lard-fed mice.Evidence suggests that the increased circulating LPS levels after high-fat feeding could be the result of a more permeable intestinal barrier.

Obese humans and ro- dents have an altered gut microbiota composition with less diversity than in lean controls and microbiota trans- plantation transfers this obese phenotype suggesting that the gut microbiota plays a role in the development of obe- sity.

Furthermore obese humans and rodents have an altered gut microbiota composition with less phylo- geneic diversity compared to lean controls and transplanta- tion of the gut microbiota from obese subjects to germ-free mice can transfer the obese phenotype.

Taken together these findings indicate a role for the gut microbiota in obe- sity and suggest that the gut microbiota could be targeted to improve metabolic diseases like obesity.

For example due to the higher oxygen concentration in the small intestine than in the colon the upper small intestine is dominated by facultative anaero- bic and aerotolerant microbes while the colon is domi- nated by strictly anaerobic microbes 6.Due to the close interaction between the host and the gut microbiota the microbiota can influence the host's physiology and metabolism.

Fur- thermore low microbial richness also correlates with oth- er metabolic parameters such as serum insulin HOMA insulin resistance and free fatty acid and triglyceride lev- els in the plasma 12.The potential causative role of the gut microbiota in obesity is supported by studies showing that the obese phenotype can be transferred by gut microbiota trans- plantation 9 13.

Furthermore they showed that colonization with a microbiota from an obese donor mouse resulted in decreased fecal energy ex- cretion indicating that the gut microbiota from obese do- nors has an increased capacity to harvest energy from thediet.

While the fat mass of mice transplanted with gut microbiota from obese donors had increased 2 weeks after colonization that of mice trans- planted with gut microbiota from lean donors did not increase.

The cecal micro- biota in the mice colonized with gut microbiota from obese donors changed after cohousing becoming more similar to that in mice colonized with gut microbiota from lean donors.
