Thus our minimal Reaction-Diffusion RD model describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the synthetic mutualistic replicators reads see I2II th L 2  d2Thwhere I and L stand for the population density of the I - and L- strain respectively t and r are the time and spatial coordinates D is the diffusion coefficient mi is the Malthusian growth rate of species i 2 I L and aij  jwae 0 is the growth rate of species i assisted by its mutualistic part- ner j 2 I L. Note that as in the case of the hypercycle model  an effective hyperbolic growth is confined to relatively low population densities by the carrying capacity k. The above set of equations generalised the two-member model by including on the one hand the spatial context through the diffusion terms D2r2 and on the other by considering both mutual- istic aij  jwae 0 and Malthusian 0  bbyang hwaemLiao jjekLiao jjyeLiao mi  bbyang hwaemLiao jjekLiao jjyeLiao miC  growth terms.The above minimal model Eq.

A list of the considered cell behaviour features followsSensing at each time step each cell senses the extracellular concentration of three kinds of molecules amino acids I - cells sense iso while L- and P cells sense leu food this category embraces any other nutrients that cells may need to grow and antibiotic i.e.

associated to a toxic molecule can reshape the species interactions leading to an advancing population that necessarily includes the three strains.ResultsEnvironmental conditions modulate synthetic mutualistic interactionsOur model system for studying mutualistic interactions is composed of a pair of bacterial strains engineered to exchange essential amino acids .

The scheme shows the logical steps that determine cell behavior according to our model.Furthermore in order to consider a fitter parasitic strain that evades the cost of the mutual- ism in antibiotic-free scenarios we consider the growth rate of P cells to be higher by a 10 difference than that of I - and L- cells.

As the snapshots in illustrate nutrients and amino acids are mainly consumed by cells at the edge of the front their depletion leaves a population of stagnant cells that effectively constitutes a fossil record of the invasion process .
