Additionally tha- natomicrobiome studies launched by Javan in 2014profiles the microbial communities in internal organs of decaying corpses has demonstrated that microbial diversity is analogous among organsfrom the same corpse but very dissimilar among corpses primarily due to PMI.Our previous gravesoil studies has shown that there are suc- cessional differences in microbial diversity at shorter time-scales.

Although soil appears to be an inert lifeless material one gram of soil may contain up to eight billion microbial cells.Recent discoveries in a gravesoil study have revealed that the soil microbial communities that are responsible for putrefaction demonstrated a decrease in Acidobacteria and an increase in Firmicutes during early stages of decomposition.

The microbial diversity of decomposing bodies starts to resemble soil microbial communities as the corpses advance to the skeletonized stage.

The microbial com- munity signatures were based on the 30 most abundant microbial taxa grouped by soil treatments buried remains versus empty burial plots .

The microbial diversity results of the three different microcosms grouped by layers in the soil cores bottom middle and top from treated and untreated soil samples were determined based on the top 30 microbial taxa .

The relative abundance or the scarcity of certain microbial taxa in gravesoil has the potential to determine the ecological status of skeletons.

In the current study we hypothesized that i. soil microbial diversity is disparate in the latter stage of decomposition skeletonization compared to the earlier stages fresh bloat active and advanced decay and ii.

the three layers of gravesoil top middle and bottom encompass similar microbial taxa and are analogous with control soil.
