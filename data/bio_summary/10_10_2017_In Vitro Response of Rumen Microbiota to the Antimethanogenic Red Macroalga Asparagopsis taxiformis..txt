the rumen fluid sam- pling and batch fermentations were carried out as previously described  .the treatments consisted of a. taxiformis biomass at a dose equivalent to 2 total om 24.7 mg dry weight two concentrations of bf 1 mm and 5 mm and one concentra- tion of bcm 5 mm included as a positive control.

the bf concentration in the a. taxiformis biomass used for this study was measured atmm  and we hypothesised that the effect would be similar to 1 mm bf with 5 mm bf included as a highconcentration positive control.

taxiformis and halogenated methane analogues decrease methane production and the relative abundance of methanogenstotal gas production decreased by 29-34 for all treatments 2 a. taxiformis1 mm bf 5 mm bf and 5 mm bcm com- pared with the control at 48 and 72 h fig.

the amount of methane formed was reduced by more than 77 with the addition of 1 mm bf and by more than 99 with the addition of 5 mm bcm 5 mm bf or a. taxiformis at both time points fig.

b. all treatments increased hydrogen accumulation after 48 h at a rate of 1.8 ml g-1 om for 1 mm bf and 5 mm bcm and 4.7 ml g-1 om for 5 mm bf and a. taxiformis fig.

the a. taxiformis and 5 mm bf treatments were grouped at 48 or 72 h demon- strating a similar impact on rumen microbial communities during batch fermentation.

incubations containing a. taxiformis5 mm bf or 5 mm bcm showed similar results with a reduction of 72 after 48 h and 75 after 72 h. the relative abundance of methanogens in incubations containing 1 mm bf was compa- rable to the other three treatments after 48 h but showed a reduction of only 60 after 72 h. the decreases in methanogen relative abundance were positively correlated with decreases in methane production spearman's correlation coefficient  0.83 p  0.0001.impact of a. taxiformis and halogenated methane analogues on microbial community compositionthe prokaryotic composition of each sample was deter- mined using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene rarefied to n  70000 per sample.

this decreased to 0.9 in the a. taxiformis treatment 0.8 in the 5 mm bf and bcm treatments and 1.2 in the 1 mm bf treatment.

addition of a. taxiformis 5 mm bf or 5 mm bcm to the incubations reduced methane produc- tion by more than 99 compared with the control.

selection of the bf concentrations was based on a previous study demonstrating that inclusion of a. taxiformis at 2 om delivers a final concentration of 1.3 mm bf .

the impact of these treatments was less pronounced than that induced by a. taxiformis and 5 mm bf with profiles occu- pying an intermediate position in the plot space.fig.

at equivalent time points no significant differences in methane production methanogen relative abundance or microbial community composition were identified between treatments containing either a. taxiformis or 5 mm bf.
