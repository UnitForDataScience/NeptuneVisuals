The rumen fluid sam- pling and batch fermentations were carried out as previously described  .The treatments consisted of A. taxiformis biomass at a dose equivalent to 2 total OM 24.7 mg dry weight two concentrations of BF 1 mM and 5 mM and one concentra- tion of BCM 5 mM included as a positive control.

The BF concentration in the A. taxiformis biomass used for this study was measured atmM  and we hypothesised that the effect would be similar to 1 mM BF with 5 mM BF included as a highconcentration positive control.

The amount of methane formed was reduced by more than 77 with the addition of 1 mM BF and by more than 99 with the addition of 5 mM BCM 5 mM BF or A. taxiformis at both time points Fig.

All treatments increased hydrogen accumulation after 48 h at a rate of 1.8 mL g-1 OM for 1 mM BF and 5 mM BCM and 4.7 mL g-1 OM for 5 mM BF and A. taxiformis Fig.

taxiformis and Halogenated Methane Analogues Decrease Methane Production and the Relative Abundance of MethanogensTotal gas production decreased by 29-34 for all treatments 2 A. taxiformis1 mM BF 5 mM BF and 5 mM BCM com- pared with the control at 48 and 72 h Fig.

Incubations containing A. taxiformis5 mM BF or 5 mM BCM showed similar results with a reduction of 72 after 48 h and 75 after 72 h. The relative abundance of methanogens in incubations containing 1 mM BF was compa- rable to the other three treatments after 48 h but showed a reduction of only 60 after 72 h. The decreases in methanogen relative abundance were positively correlated with decreases in methane production Spearman's correlation coefficient  0.83 p  0.0001.Impact of A. taxiformis and Halogenated Methane Analogues on Microbial Community CompositionThe prokaryotic composition of each sample was deter- mined using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene rarefied to n  70000 per sample.

The A. taxiformis and 5 mM BF treatments were grouped at 48 or 72 h demon- strating a similar impact on rumen microbial communities during batch fermentation.

This decreased to 0.9 in the A. taxiformis treatment 0.8 in the 5 mM BF and BCM treatments and 1.2 in the 1 mM BF treatment.

Addition of A. taxiformis 5 mM BF or 5 mM BCM to the incubations reduced methane produc- tion by more than 99 compared with the control.
