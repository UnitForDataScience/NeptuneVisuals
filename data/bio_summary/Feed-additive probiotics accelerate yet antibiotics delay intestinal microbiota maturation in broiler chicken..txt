secondly serum igg and intestinal secretory iga were compared among the groups  as serum igg reflects the system immune state while intestinal secretory iga reflects the intestinal immunity state on day 14 the probiotic group exhibit 63.7 and 48.0 higher expression level of serum igg respectively than the control and the antibiotic groups and moreover 4.2 and 4.6 higher intestinal secretory iga than the other two groups.

in addition from day 1 to day 42 the beta diversity of intestinal microbiota changed more heavily in the antibiotic group f  0.164 p  0.003 ano- sim than in either the control group f  0.136 p  0.003 or the probiotic group f  0.149 p  0.003.to quantitatively define the speed of microbiota ma- turity and thus compare the impact of feed additives and diet in general on microbiota development we propose an index called intestinal microbiota matur- ation index immi which is defined as time required to reach the full maturity of gut microbiota as definedby the additive-free group .

furthermore compared with the control group n  33 the number of genera participating in the core interaction network decreased in the antibiotic group n  27 and the probiotic group n  25. interestingly the inhibition of many intestinal non-lactobacillus gen- era by the intestinal lactobacillus spp.

one such example is immi which can be used to quantitatively compare the speed of intestinal micro- biota maturity under different feed additives or diets.notably both antibiotic treatment and probiotic treat- ment exhibited positive effects on growth-related traits of the broilers however they had quite opposite effects on maturation of the intestinal microbiota antibiotics delayed microbiota maturation while probiotics acceler- ated the maturation.

during the first 22 days no significant adfi change p  0.05 was detected among the three groups but the antibiotic group exhibit 10.6 and 5.9 higher adg than control and probiotic group as for fcr the antibiotic group is 13.4 and 9.1 lower than the control and probiotic group fig.

in the next 21 days both the antibiotic and the probiotic groups produced a9.8 and 10.4 higher adg than the control howeverthe probiotic group consumed less food and consequently exhibit a 5.9 lower fcr than the antibiotic group.

as for the centralization of network the probiotic group always featured the highest concentrations of interacting genera during the whole trial followed by the control and the antibiotic group fig.. thus both lp-8 and antibiotics as feed additive play a key role in formation and development of the web of bacterial interactions in broiler intestinal microbiota.discussionthe growth-promoting effects of probiotics are dependent on specific probiotics used and the applica- tion level of probiotics our data here suggested that lp-8 administration just like antibiotic supplemen- tation significantly improved the growth-related matri- ces of broilers and also promoted immunological parameters in an industrial chicken farming setting.

the immune organ indices of the thymus gland bursa and spleen on day 42 were 29.3 36.5 and 28.0 higher in the probiotic group than the control and immune organ index of the thymus gland was 14.7 higher in the probiotic group than the anti- biotic group indicating a most enhanced immunity in the probiotic group fig.

due to administration of lp-8 against other intestinal bacterial genera might reduce nutrient consumption by the intestinal micro- biota which could have underlie the decline of fcr in the probiotic group fig.

by inducing anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity of the host which avoids biological damage caused by free radicals finally it was reported that probiotic lactobacillus species might promote gut defense function by competi- tive exclusion of intestinal pathogens or via activa- tion and enhancement of local cell-mediated immunity against certain enteric pathogens however it is not yet clear how lp-8 here specifically promoted the growth of the intestinal lactobacillus spp.

fur- thermore maturation of intestinal microbiota was greatly accelerated by probiotic feeding yet significantly retarded and eventually delayed by antibiotic feeding.

consistently profound functional distinction in intestinal microbiota was revealed by metagenomic sequencing between the probiotic and the antibiotic groups.

thus apparently probiotic and antibiotic administrations generated opposite effects on the age-dependent maturation of intestinal microbiota with the former accelerating the process whereas the latter delaying it the relative abundance change of the 16 age-discriminatory taxa are shown in additional file fig.

on the other hand admin- istration of lp-8 and that of the antibiotics carry a immi of 15 and 40 respectively as compared to a immi of 30 for the control group.organismal features of intestinal microbiota in the probiotic and the antibiotic treatmentsto further probe how the distinct feed additives drive in- testinal microbiota change we compared the 16s gene- based profiles of bacterial phylogeny at the genus level at each of sampling times across the three groups.

thus the distinct gut micro- biota maturity rate between the antibiotic and the probiotic groups can lead to profound alteration of microbiota function.the key role of lp-8 in formation and development of bacterial correlation network in intestinal microbiotato probe the potential mechanism underlying the dis- tinct temporal patterns of gut microbiota maturation among the three regimens we compared the corre- sponding co-occurrence networks among the bacterial genera.
