The longest 1000 bp and most covered 5000 reads contigs enriched through hybridization capture were aligned with blastn against the NCBI representative genomes May 28 2014 and wgs October 6 2014 databases.ResultsWe applied our hybridization capture approach to target and reconstruct the flanking regions of the 471-bp linA gene which encodes a dehydrochlorinase involved in the first steps of the degradation of hexachlorocyclohexane HCH a chemical pesticide that was widely used for years to control agricultural pests and now prohibited in many countries because of its toxicity and persistence in the environment On the basis of all linA nucleicsequences available in databases we designed a set of four non-overlapping degenerated 80-mer probes cap- able of targeting all known genes belonging to linA1 linA2 and linA3 types and potentially unknown linA variants Additional file Table S1.

Based on the potency of sequence capture for expanding knowledge beyond target DNA regions studies have used hybridization capture strategies to study the un- known flanking regions of genes or particular genomic regions .

However more recent studies have devoted attention to reads outside the targeted re- gions Based on the potency of the sequence capture for expanding knowledge beyond target DNA regions studies have used hybridization capture strategies to study the unknown flanking regions of genes or particu- lar genomic regions .

Thus during this step large genomic fragments obtained after hybridization capture were cut to short DNA frag- ments approximately 400 bp.Data files are publicly available through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive SRA  under accession numbers SRR3545174 hybridization capture on the artificial mixture of strains SRR3546812 hybridization capture on the soil sample and SRR3546814 shotgun sequencing on the soil sample.Data processingAll raw reads were scanned for library adaptors and quality filtered using the PRINSEQ-lite PERL script prior to analysis.

In a previous work we described the first adaptation of hybridization capture to a complex metagenomic sample This approach efficiently enriched complete targets but also recovered off-target sequences.In the present study we developed a new hybridization capture method that facilitates the reconstruction of large genomic regions surrounding a targeted biomarker fromboth a simple biological model and complex metagen- omes.

We were con- sequently able to efficiently reconstruct more than 40 kbp of the genome of S. indicum by targeting the short 471-bp linA gene using only four probes.Application of hybridization capture to a metagenomic sampleWe next determined whether our hybridization capture method could scale to metagenomic samples.

This innovative strategy opens new possibilities to expand knowledge beyond known targeted DNA regions for both organismcommunities and single organisms and resolve concerns in numerous biological studies.Additional filesAbbreviationsHCH Hexachlorocyclohexane IS Insertion sequence MDA Multiple displacement amplification NGS Next-generation sequencingSRA Sequence read archiveAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank J-Y Richard SITA Remediation Suez for providing the soil sample.FundingThis work was supported by the French Direction Generale de l'Armement DGA the program Investissements d'Avenir AMI 2011 VALTEX the Auvergne Regional Council and the European Regional Development Fund FEDER.Availability of data and materialSequencing reads are publicly available through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive SRA under accession numbers SRR3545174 hybridization capture on the artificial mixture of strains SRR3546812 hybridization capture on the soil sample and SRR3546814 shotgun sequencing on the soil sample.Authors' contributionsC.G.

Moreovercoupling our hybridization capture method with the use of third-generation sequencing platforms such as PacBio sequencing would enable the direct sequencing of the long fragments captured and would consequently further im- prove the resolution of complex DNA regions harboring numerous repeats.ConclusionsDespite the advent of NGS technologies de novo assem- bly of whole genomes from single organisms or metage- nomic samples remains a huge challenge with numerous genomic regions of interest that still remain underex- plored.

The four selected probes are distributed uniformly over the entire length of the linA gene and can hybridize all the known linA sequences used for the probe design and potentially other linA variants never described in da- tabases.

Due to the capture of long DNA fragments carrying linA we also significantly enriched linA flanking regions totaling 19.15 of sequences.
