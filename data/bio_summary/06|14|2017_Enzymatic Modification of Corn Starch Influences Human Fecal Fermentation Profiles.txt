Moreover it is likely that a high branched structure would lead to a higher amount of BCFAs.In contrast to SCFAs BCFAs have been associated with undesirable protein fermentation leading to many metabolites that are potentially toxic to the host and associated with carcinogenic effects in the colon.However in batch in vitro fermentation systems such as that employed in this study high BCFA production can also result from higher total metabolic activity of the microbiota.Because AMG also resulted in high butyrate production which arises from carbohydrate fermenta- tion and not protein fermentation it appeared that the high BCFAs arising from the AMG-treated starch were due to higher metabolic activity and not the lack of carbohydrate substrate.Hence modifications induced by enzymatic treatment of starch granules had a significant effect on in vitro digestion and the fermentation pattern.

Flow diagram for in vitro digestion and fermentation of starch samples.effects.In vitro fermentation and SCFA production have been useful to estimate the impact of dietary carbohydrates on human health.-However while several studies have been reported on the fermentation properties of resistant starches no studies have been reported on the susceptibility of structurally modified starches to be fermented by gut bacteria.

Furthermore in vitro fermentations allow for quantitative measurement of metabo- lites produced by the microbiota upon fermentation of specific substrates which have importance in the health of the host.-The most important end products of fermentation are short-chain fatty acids SCFAs principally acetate propionate and butyrate and branched-chain fatty acids BCFAs that are then absorbed and metabolized by the host.

SCFAs are produced mainly from carbohydrate fermentation and have health benefits whereas BCFAs are a result of proteolytic fermentation and may have deleteriousgranule which led to small pores on the surface with a simultaneous release of oligosaccharides and production of cyclodextrins.

An adequate carbohydrate supply promotes the growth of beneficial saccharolytic members of the microbiota such as Roseburia Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii that otherwise are outcompeted by more resilient but less beneficial genera such as Alistipes Bilophila and Bacteroides.Roseburia and E. rectale are especially important butyrate producers in the gut microbiota.Butyric-acid-rich fermentations are generally observed with some types of starch that escape digestion in the small intestine.A recent study conducted by Dan et al.showed that in vivo colonic fermentation of unripe banana starch resulted in high butyrate production when compared to the control diet also showing a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo fermentation.

Long term dietary pattern of fecal donor correlates with butyrate production and markers of protein fermentation during in vitro fecal fermentation.

In addition in vitro fecal fermentation coupled to in vitro digestion can provide information about how dietary components such as resistant starch are metabolized by gut bacteria.

In vitro fermentation tests provide an insightful opportunity to study the function ofthe microbiota i.e.

The objective of this research was to determine the impact of structural modification of starch granules on the in vitro digestion and fermentation.

In vitro fecal fermentation was performed according to the method described by Arcila et al.
