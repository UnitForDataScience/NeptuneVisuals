Of further note however as far as we are aware no studies to date have reported detection of protein-bound LysCN in vivo.Quantification of 2-AAA and LysCN in biological samplesTo address the issue of LysCN conversion to 2-AAA during sample preparation we used enzymatic proteolytic digestion to break down the protein into its constituent amino acids under conditions where both 2-AAA and LysCN are stable.

Addition of catalase a scavenger of H2O2 dramatically reduced the production of both 2-AAA and LysCN and addition of methionine a scavenger of HOCl 24 48 49 also diminished both 2-AAA and LysCN formation consistent withLin et al.Page 11neutrophils employing the MPOH2O2Cl- system in generation of these post translational modifications of lysine Figure 9.MPO forms 2-AAA and LysCN in vivo at sites of inflammationWe further investigated whether MPO is involved in the formation of 2-AAA and LysCN at sites of inflammation in vivo.

Similarly a significant increase in protein-bound LysCN is formed in WT mice injected with TG and ZM P0.001 but not in MPO-KO mice Figure 10B.Moreover while at baseline similar protein content of 2-AAA and LysCN in peritoneal lavage proteins were noted the amount of LysCN produced during inflammation was approximately half that observed for 2-AAA.MPO oxidation is a source of free 2-AAA production in vivoWe also examined whether MPO can generate free 2-AAA in vivo.

Under the conditions employed for the assay the limit of detection SN of peak 31 of LysCN was 40 nM.Human aortic lesions are enriched in both 2-AAA and LysCNIn the final series of studies we sought to test whether 2-AAA and LysCN are present in normal human aorta and whether levels of these oxidation products are enriched in aortic atherosclerotic lesions.

We therefore include the hypothetical pathway involving Cl2 reaction with protein lysyl residues leading directly to lysine monochloramine and dichloramine derivatives as yet another possible pathway envisioned at high ratios of oxidant to target protein Ne-Lys groups for generation of LysCN Figure 12.Our studies reveal that prior analyses that reported detection of protein-bound 2-AAA in tissues likely overestimated 2-AAA formation due to acid catalyzed hydrolysis of protein- bound LysCN into 2-AAA.

1 of the HOCl added of the stable end products oflysine oxidation monitored while LysCN becomes the major product at a higher molar ratio the yield of LysCN is approx.

The production of 2-AAA LysCN and oxidation precursor lysine were quantified by LCMSMS as described in Materials and Methods.Only under the complete MPOH2O2Cl- system 2-AAA and LysCN were produced.

Data points shown represent duplicate analyses of a sample from an individual aorta reported as mmol oxidation productmol Lys of either 2-AAA or LysCN as indicated and the bar represents mean - S.D.Lin et al.Page 31Figure 12.Schematic illustration of reaction pathways for the formation of 2-AAA and LysCN by MPOH2O2Cl- HOCl oxidation of protein-bound lysine.

In initial studies we observed that traditional acid- or base- catalyzed protein hydrolysis methods previously employed to measure tissue 2-AAA can artificially generate protein-bound 2-AAA from an alternative potential lysine oxidative product lysine nitrile LysCN.

Using a validated protease-based digestion method coupled with stable isotope dilution LCMSMS we now report protein bound 2-AAA and LysCN are both formed by hypochlorous acid HOCl and the MPOH2O2Cl- system of leukocytes.
