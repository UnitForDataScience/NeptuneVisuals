Finally the mother consumed the probiotic LGG and we detected LGG-like transcripts in the infant transcriptome indicating that LGG has been transferred is an active mem- ber at the earliest time point and is decreasing in abundance and activity during weaning showing that LGG is not likely to remain a permanent member of the intestinal microbiota.The here described approach and pipeline allow for further longitudinal analysis of infant activity to complement infant cohort metagenome studies that are presently developing.DisclosureThe abstract of this paper was presented before on the Darmendag Gutflora day 2015 in Rotterdam Netherlands.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Authors' ContributionsLotta Nylund Reetta Satokari and Willem M. de Vos designed the study and Lotta Nylund carried out the RNA extractions and preparation of the sequencing.

The study indicates that metatranscriptome analysis of the infant gut microbiota is feasible on infant stool samples and can be used to provide insight into the core activities of the developing community.BackgroundAfter birth newborns are rapidly colonized by intestinal microbiota originating from the surrounding environment including maternal faecal microbes and vaginal or skin spe- cies depending on the mode of delivery It is generally assumed that the first colonizers of the infant intestine are facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus Enterococcus and Lactobacillus spp.

After quality filtering a total number of0.590.49c0.59approximately 2.5 million reads were obtained in all samples However when analysing these it was observed that reads derived from rRNA were dominating in samples where in vitro rRNA removal was not applied in silico filtering of rRNA sequences by means of matching to 5S 16S and 23S rRNA gene databases removed about 99 of readsFigure 1 a Numbers of reads at different stages of in silico filtering.

Bifidobacterium and to a lesser extent Bacteroides are considered the predominant bacterial genera colonizing the early infant gut when the infant is breastfed as these bacteria have the rather unique capacity to degrade human milk oligosaccharides 10.

These glycosidase genes had been previously found to beof bifidobacterial -galactosidase while the infant receivedpresent before the introduction of solid food While Acti-exclusively breast-milk T1 whereas unidentified Firmicutes were the main producer of this enzyme at T3 when the infant diet included also a variety of solid foods and dairy products 3.
