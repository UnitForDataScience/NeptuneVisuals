Several research teams including ours have nevertheless successfully confronted the cultivation issue for the human gut microbiota albeit with different methodological approaches and outcomes .In 2011 Goodman and colleagues used 'high-throughput anaerobic culturing techniques' to generate a 'personal human gut microbiota culture collection' consisting of more than a thousand isolates from one adult human .

More recently the importance of the commensal gut microbiota for human health has become apparent with key roles identified for commensals in normal physiological processes from metab- olism to immune development and function .Studies that apply advanced computational analysis to high-throughput sequencing data from large patient cohorts or from gnotobiotic mouse models to identify bacteria associated with or enriched in disease demon- strate the utility and power of the in silico approach  Nevertheless in response to the ever-mounting correla- tive evidence suggesting a health-promoting role for various commensal microorganisms we propose a variant of Koch's postulates   that is intended to provide a conceptual framework for experimental valida- tion of the hypotheses inferred from genomic analysis of microbiomes.

To overcome these limitations and to use models that are more relevant to the human situation researchers have been deriving gnotobiotic mice and animals with a human gut microbiota  and diet .

At around the same time a number of novel enteric species were recovered by the culturomics approach and genome sequences were generated for many of them  general culturability of the gut microbiota Lau and colleagues  developed culture conditions to target species of the Lachnospiraceae family which comprise a significant unexplored proportion of the healthy human gut microbiota.

The authors describe how the majority of the human gut microbiota canbe cultured using a single bacteriological medium thereby demonstrating that the gut microbiota is largely culturable.32.

This specialist knowledge has been crucial to thoroughly mine the human gut microbiota particularly in the absence of methods for the routine cultivation of most enteric microorganisms.

In recent years however significant efforts have been made to address the 'great plate count anomaly' and to overcome the barriers to cultivation of the fastidious and mostly strictly anaerobic bacteria that reside in the human gut.

These continually expanding resources enable experimental investigation of the human gut microbiota validation of hypotheses made with sequence- based analyses and phenotypic characterisation of its constituent microbes.

Whole genome sequences were generated for the 31 new bacterial species isolated.Various successes and progress in culturing the human gut microbiota were published throughout 2016.
