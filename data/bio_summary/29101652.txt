The role of these cytokines in the mechanism by which Tregs inhibit osteoclast formation is supported in studies by Luo et al 58 and Kim et al 59 who demonstrated that CD4 Tregs suppressed osteoclast formation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs via the expression of the cytokines TGFb IL-4 and IL-10.Compared to the above T helper subsets Th17 cells primarily support osteoclast differentiation through the production of IL-17A and are believed to play a crucial role in inflammation and the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

The small intestine is characterized by plicae circulares folds in the duodenum villi which are finger like projections that extend out into the lumen throughout the small intestine and microvilli at the apical surface of epithelial cells together these structures vastly increase the surface area for nutrient absorption while once thought to be greater than the area of a5These authors contributed equally to this work and are co-senior authorsCollins et al.Page 2tennis court more recent studies indicate the surface area is more on the order of half a badminton court 32 meters 2.
