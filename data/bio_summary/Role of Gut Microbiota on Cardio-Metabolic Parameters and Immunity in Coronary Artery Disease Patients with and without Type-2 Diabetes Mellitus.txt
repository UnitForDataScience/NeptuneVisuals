At the phyla level the majority of the OTUS werefound to belong to Bacteroidetes 53.87 CAD-DM2 vs. 63.42 CAD-NDM2 P  0.001 Firmicutes was the next most abundant 25.69 CAD-DM2 vs. 23.29 CAD-NDM2 P 0.49 followedby Proteobacterias 3.67 CAD-DM2 vs. 2.05 CAD-NDM2 P 0.04 but only Bacteroidetes and Proteobacterias exhibited significant differences between both the CAD-DM2 and the CAD-NDM2 study groups.

No significant differences in the abundance of Sutterella Phascolarctobacterium Parabacteroides Oscillospira Roseburia Ruminococcus Odoribacter Blautia and other minority genera were found between the two study groups and .At a specie levels we found a significant decrease in the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis 0.43 CAD-DM2 vs. 1.38 CAD-NDM2 P  0.05 Bacteroides ovatus 0.99 CAD-DM2 vs.1.86 CAD-NDM2 P  0.05 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii2.03 CAD-DM2 vs. 3.72 CAD-NDM2 P  0.05 inthe CAD-DM2 group when compared with the CAD-NDM2 patients.Increased Circulating Zonulin Levels in CAD-DM2 PatientsThe circulating zonulin levels were measured by means of the ELISA method.

In the CAD-DM2 patients circulating zonulin levels were significantly higher than in CAD-NDM2 patients 5.98 - 1.4 vs. 3.34 - 1.6 ngml P  0.001.Relationship between the Gut Microbiota Composition and Glucose Metabolism Serum Levels of Inflammatory Mediators Serum TMAO and Plasma Zonulin Levels and Relative Expression of FOXP3In the CAD-DM2 patients Firmicutes was positively correlated with HbA1c and fasting triglycerides r 0.849 P 0.030 and r 0.648 P 0.043 respectively and Proteobacteria was positively correlated with HOMA-IR r 0.754 P 0.012 while Bacteroidetes was negatively associated with HOMA-IR r 0.849 P 0.03.

On the other hand in the CAD-DM2 group the increase in Enterobacteriaceae p 0.005 b 0.945 r2 0.96 and the decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii p 0.041 b 0.911 r2 0.91 were associated with the increase in serum TMAO levels while the decrease in the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis p 0.039 b 0.911 r2 0.91 was associated with the reduction in the FOXP3 mRNA expression.Functional Differences in Gut Microbiota between Both Study Groupsof carbohydrates lipids amino acids and energy weremetabolism P  0.029 inositol phosphate metabolism metabolism P  0.020 butanoate metabolism P  0.023DISCUSSIONThe present study in which we used 16S ribosomal RNA of gut microbiota for high throughput sequencing has demonstrated that the diversity and gut microbial composition were different between CAD-DM2 and CAD-NDM2.

These results suggest that the presence of DM2 is related to an impaired regulation of the immune system in CAD patients mediated in part by the gut microbiota composition and functionality and the production and effects of their gut microbiota derived molecules.Keywords gut microbiota coronary artery disease zonulin levels gut permeability increase TMAO production factor Forkhead box P3 type-2 diabetes mellitus anti-inflammatory IL-10INTRODUCTIONPrevious studies have shown an important connection between metabolism intestinal microbial composition and the development of cardiovascular risk      .
