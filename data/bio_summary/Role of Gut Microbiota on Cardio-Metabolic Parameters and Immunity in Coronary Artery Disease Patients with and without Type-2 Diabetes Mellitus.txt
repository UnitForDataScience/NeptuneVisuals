no significant differences in the abundance of sutterella phascolarctobacterium parabacteroides oscillospira roseburia ruminococcus odoribacter blautia and other minority genera were found between the two study groups and .at a specie levels we found a significant decrease in the abundance of bacteroides fragilis 0.43 cad-dm2 vs. 1.38 cad-ndm2 p  0.05 bacteroides ovatus 0.99 cad-dm2 vs.1.86 cad-ndm2 p  0.05 and faecalibacterium prausnitzii2.03 cad-dm2 vs. 3.72 cad-ndm2 p  0.05 inthe cad-dm2 group when compared with the cad-ndm2 patients.increased circulating zonulin levels in cad-dm2 patientsthe circulating zonulin levels were measured by means of the elisa method.

these results suggest that the presence of dm2 is related to an impaired regulation of the immune system in cad patients mediated in part by the gut microbiota composition and functionality and the production and effects of their gut microbiota derived molecules.keywords gut microbiota coronary artery disease zonulin levels gut permeability increase tmao production factor forkhead box p3 type-2 diabetes mellitus anti-inflammatory il-10introductionprevious studies have shown an important connection between metabolism intestinal microbial composition and the development of cardiovascular risk      .

accumulating evidence suggests that dm2 and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension atherosclerosis or heart failure are associated with alterations in the integrity of the gut barrier and augmented gut permeability  .finally gut microbiota has been reported to be a factor that is able to link intestinal immunity and host metabolism.

recent research has revealed that circulating zonulin levels are significantly higher in patients with diabetes polycystic ovary syndrome obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease all of which are regarded as traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis  .therefore in our study cad-dm2 patients presented an alteration in gut microbiota equilibrium dysbiosis a disruption of gut barrier function and an increase in gut permeability which altogether may result in aberrant production and absorption of microbe derived metabolites such as tmao which can exert their atherogenic effect through alterations in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism activation of inflammatory pathways and promotion of foam cells formation.

these results suggest that the presence of dm2 is related to an impaired regulation of the immune system in cad patients mediated in part by the gut microbiota composition and functionality and the production and effects of their gut microbiota derived molecules.
