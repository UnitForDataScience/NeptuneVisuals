These results suggest that the presence of DM2 is related to an impaired regulation of the immune system in CAD patients mediated in part by the gut microbiota composition and functionality and the production and effects of their gut microbiota derived molecules.Keywords gut microbiota coronary artery disease zonulin levels gut permeability increase TMAO production factor Forkhead box P3 type-2 diabetes mellitus anti-inflammatory IL-10INTRODUCTIONPrevious studies have shown an important connection between metabolism intestinal microbial composition and the development of cardiovascular risk      .

At the phyla level the majority of the OTUS werefound to belong to Bacteroidetes 53.87 CAD-DM2 vs. 63.42 CAD-NDM2 P  0.001 Firmicutes was the next most abundant 25.69 CAD-DM2 vs. 23.29 CAD-NDM2 P 0.49 followedby Proteobacterias 3.67 CAD-DM2 vs. 2.05 CAD-NDM2 P 0.04 but only Bacteroidetes and Proteobacterias exhibited significant differences between both the CAD-DM2 and the CAD-NDM2 study groups.

No significant differences in the abundance of Sutterella Phascolarctobacterium Parabacteroides Oscillospira Roseburia Ruminococcus Odoribacter Blautia and other minority genera were found between the two study groups and .At a specie levels we found a significant decrease in the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis 0.43 CAD-DM2 vs. 1.38 CAD-NDM2 P  0.05 Bacteroides ovatus 0.99 CAD-DM2 vs.1.86 CAD-NDM2 P  0.05 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii2.03 CAD-DM2 vs. 3.72 CAD-NDM2 P  0.05 inthe CAD-DM2 group when compared with the CAD-NDM2 patients.Increased Circulating Zonulin Levels in CAD-DM2 PatientsThe circulating zonulin levels were measured by means of the ELISA method.

C Log2-fold change of the abundances of KEGG categories showing significant difference between CAD-DM2 and CAD-NDM2 groups.higher levels of Streptococcus a common oral and gut taxon found in CAD-DM2 patients when compared with CAD-NDM2 patients which were negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol levels in these diabetic patients could be influencing CADevolution through the regulation of the lipid metabolism in the host.The present study has demonstrated that CAD-DM2 patients had significantly higher plasma levels of TMAO when comparedwith CAD-NDM2.

Accumulating evidence suggests that DM2 and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension atherosclerosis or heart failure are associated with alterations in the integrity of the gut barrier and augmented gut permeability  .Finally gut microbiota has been reported to be a factor that is able to link intestinal immunity and host metabolism.

We found a significant increase in Veillonellaceae 28.93 CAD-DM2 vs. 16.97 CAD-NDM2 P  0.001Enterobacteriaceae 19.53 CAD-DM2 vs. 4.73 CAD-NDM2P0.016 Rikenellaceae 11.13 CAD-DM2 vs. 9.92CAD-NDM2 P 0.023 Streptococcaceae 6.64 CAD-DM2 vs. 2.55 CAD-NDM2 P  0.001 and Desulfovibrionaceae 13.95 CAD-DM2 vs. 10.69 CAD-NDM2 P  0.001 inCAD-DM2 group.

On the other hand in the CAD-DM2 group the increase in Enterobacteriaceae p 0.005 b 0.945 r2 0.96 and the decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii p 0.041 b 0.911 r2 0.91 were associated with the increase in serum TMAO levels while the decrease in the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis p 0.039 b 0.911 r2 0.91 was associated with the reduction in the FOXP3 mRNA expression.Functional Differences in Gut Microbiota between Both Study Groupsof carbohydrates lipids amino acids and energy weremetabolism P  0.029 inositol phosphate metabolism metabolism P  0.020 butanoate metabolism P  0.023DISCUSSIONThe present study in which we used 16S ribosomal RNA of gut microbiota for high throughput sequencing has demonstrated that the diversity and gut microbial composition were different between CAD-DM2 and CAD-NDM2.

Recent research has revealed that circulating zonulin levels are significantly higher in patients with diabetes polycystic ovary syndrome obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease all of which are regarded as traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis  .Therefore in our study CAD-DM2 patients presented an alteration in gut microbiota equilibrium dysbiosis a disruption of gut barrier function and an increase in gut permeability which altogether may result in aberrant production and absorption of microbe derived metabolites such as TMAO which can exert their atherogenic effect through alterations in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism activation of inflammatory pathways and promotion of foam cells formation.

The present study indicated that the diversity and composition of gut microbiota were different between the CAD-DM2 and CAD-NDM2 patients.
