2008. a number of severe bleaching events have assaulted coral reefs around the world over the past 35 years including in 19811982 19971998 20012002 20052006 2010 and 20142016. the mostrecent events have seen extreme bleaching with 75 ofthe corals bleached in some locations in hawaii min- ton et al.
