these are relatively easy to set up but it is prudent to do a thorough cost analysis before doing so as there are added expenses of creating maintaining and monitoring gf mice as compared to conventional mice.mono-associated micegf mice are also important to microbiota research because they can be reconstituted with agents ranging from a single bacterium mono-associated to defined microbiota for example modified schaedler's flora to complex microbiota to xenografted microbiota for example human microbiota.

moreover results from gnotobiotic mice must be interpreted with caution as the lack of microbiota in gf mice or lower microbial richness and diversity of defined microbiota mice do not fully recapitulate the complex interactions that occur within the microbiota of conventionally raised mice or the humans which they are intended to model98 99. studies using gnotobiotic animals should perhaps best be performed in multiple microbiota statuses.

for example gf mice may implicate microbiota mono-association studies may aid in identification of putative causative agents of disease and studies using defined microbiota and ultimately highly complex microbiota may confirm the role of these causative agents in a context that is more translatable to human health.franklin and ericssonpage 9reproducibility considerations in complex microbiota studieswhile classical gnotobiology allows for optimal control of gm it is now also possible to optimize reproducibility of studies that use animals with naturally occurring complex gm.

gf rodents free of all microorganisms including bacteria viruses with the exception of endogenous retroviruses fungi protozoa and other parasites 2 mono-associated animals generated by colonizing gf animals with a single agent and 3 defined microbiota flora animals generated by reconstituting gf mice with cocktails or consortia of bacteria or other agents.franklin and ericssonpage 7germfree micein studies of microbiota gf mice are ideal for asking whether or not microbiota in general plays any role in a model phenotype.

collectively these findings indicate that any beneficial or detrimental process ascribed to a microbe in mono-franklin and ericssonpage 8associated mice should be interpreted only after performing similar studies where the agent in question is in the presence of complex microbiota89.defined microbiota flora miceto circumvent some of the physiologic disadvantages of gf and mono-associated mice while still maintaining a controlled microbiota mice reconstituted with defined microbiota were established.

disadvantages of using defined microbiota mice center on the simplicity of this microbiota which does not recapitulate the interactions that may occur in complex microbiota that typifies human and animal populations.

a return to the day when rodents were contaminated with these pathogens is unlikely but can a happy medium be found where the richness of gm of laboratory mice can be increased without introducing unwanted pathogens this scenario also raises questions about how other intestinal inhabitants including viruses protozoa and fungi influence the bacterial microbiota and model phenotypes.franklin and ericssonpage 12other questions that remain unanswered include what common husbandry variables for example bedding diet and housing affect the microbiota and how do we avoid institutional microbiota drift to optimize reproducibility are there strategies to decrease the expense of gnotobiotic housing whole genome sequencing transcriptomics metabolomics and bioinformatics and are novel statistical methods required for these complex data sets how can we take advantage of the inherent variability of the gm in our rodent populations and can this variability be exploited to model personalized medicine all of these questions face the biomedical research and laboratory animal community but will surely be surmounted in these exciting times of this rapidly evolving field.referenceswhitman wb coleman dc wiebe wj.

rodent studies designed to uncover mechanisms of diet-induced microbiota changes--for example studies assessing the link between diet microbiota and obesity11--have confirmed that dramatic changes in diet can alter the rodent gm.

the use of these mice has been critical to our understanding of how intestinal microbes can influence health and disease especially when coupled with mono-association defined microbiota or complex microbiota strategies4 72-74. data from gf mouse studies must also be interpreted with caution as several normal host physiologic parameters are altered in these mice.

phenotypic differences detected in isogenic pups born to dams harboring distinct gm may be associated with differences in the gm or they may be due to differing levels of maternal care or epigenetic factors such as methylation status107.many other techniques including antibiotic administration fecal microbiota transfer and humanizing  xenografting microbiota have also been established.

schaedler et al.90 91 initiated these studies by defining key cultivable components of the intestinal microbiota and then experimentally inoculating gf mice with various cocktails of aerobes and anaerobes.

in this article we review some of the most common sources of gm variability in rodent models and discuss measures to address this variability for improved reproducibility.the past two decades have seen an explosion of research investigating the role of microbiota in health and disease.

it is now well established that the gut microbiota gm plays a critical role in health with mechanisms ranging from aiding in digestion to promoting immune system development and colonization resistance against bacterial pathogens and pathobionts.moreover the advent of next-generation sequencing has allowed for robust surveys of these populations and many recent studies have shown that patients with a number of diseases both enteric and systemic often have gm that differs from their healthy counterparts2 3.this occurs even in situations where the hosts are genetically identical4.

for example exposure to lipopolysaccharides during vaginal delivery induces epithelial tolerance in the offspring resulting in differential innate immune responses between mice delivered via the two modes24.experimental or therapeutic procedures also have potential to alter microbiota.
