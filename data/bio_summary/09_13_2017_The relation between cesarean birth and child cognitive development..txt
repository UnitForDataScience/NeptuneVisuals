dPoor maternal health is self-reporting of fair or poor general health 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale of general health and maternal mental health is ever experienced depressive symptoms in the last 4 weeks a scorebelow 3 on a Kessler 6-point scale of mental health.

The indi- rect association may occur through established links between cesarean birth and adverse child health outcomes including asthma type I diabetes allergies-and obesitythat are also associated with impaired functioning and lower academic performance .

The surgical nature of cesarean procedures also poses postnatal maternal health risks with potential knock-on effects for the child's development through altered mother-child interac- tionsand lower rates of breastfeeding-.The direct association may occur through alterations to the infant's gut microbiota.

Information on diagnosis of ADD and ASD at 8-9 may still be a valid measure of the presence of these conditions at 4-5.maternal general health is significantly associated with lower vocabulary at 4-5 years but otherwise maternal health is not significantly linked to any of the cognitive measures.Combining these results breastfeeding obesity and ADD are found to significantly mediate the relation between cesarean birth and child cognitive outcomes although the effects size and significance vary Table .

OPENReceived 10 March 2017Accepted 16 August 2017 Published xx xx xxxxThe relation between cesarean birth and child cognitive developmentCain Polidano1 Anna Zhu1  Joel C. Bornstein 2This is the first detailed study of the relation between cesarean birth and child cognitive development.

The implication is that non-random attrition does not appear to be seriously biasing our results.Whether participants in LSAC are cesarean born is identified in the initial survey by the primary care giver's response to the question was...the type of birth delivery method a cesarean In our sample approximately 30 of primary care givers report that their children were cesarean-born between March 2003 and February 2004.

The implication is that there is a critical window to correct any disruption to the gut microbi- ota after which cognitive impacts are permanent.In this study we estimate the relation between cesarean birth and child cognitive outcomes using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children LSAC a nationally representative birth cohort surveyed biennially and multivariate regression techniques.

Under equation  the higher the proportion of variation in the outcome variable explained by the model R2 the smaller the discrepancy in the estimates of g1 and g1lower.For any estimated negative relation between cesarean birth and cognitive development the larger the discrep-ancy between estimates of g1lower and g1 the more unreliable g1 as an estimate of the true relation.ResultsThe estimated OLS relations between cesarean birth and child cognitive outcomes equation  for all births in our sample n  3666 are reported in Table .
