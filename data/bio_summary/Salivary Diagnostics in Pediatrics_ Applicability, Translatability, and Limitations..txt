A recent study of 744 children age 11 showed that salivary levels of c-reactive protein salivary insulin and leptin were higher and adiponectin levels lower in obese children compared to healthy normal weight children .

Malnourished children have specific salivary proteomic variations associated with protein energy under nutri- tion or PEU  and children affected with type 1 diabetes have been shown to have higher levels of salivary pro-inflammatory biomarkers compared to healthy controls.

With the use of a regression equation salivary glucose values could accurately be converted to blood glucose levels providing patients especially children with type 1 diabetes with a non-invasive tool for self- monitoring .Beyond assessing the nutritional and metabolic status of children there have been a limited number of studies utilizing salivary proteins for disease detection in this population.

Similarly rubella-specific IgM antibodies are detectable in children's saliva  as are IgG levels of children who are seropositive for mumps measles and the herpes simplex virus  .

However the majority of these assays have targeted diseases that more commonly affect the adult population largely neglecting infants and children who arguably could benefit the most from non-invasive assessment tools for health monitoring.

Further as national and international organiza- tions such as the United States Food and Drug Association USFDA now mandate enrollment of children in clinical trials assays that do not rely on invasive blood sampling offer a safer more appealing alternative -.

Salivary assay development for the adult population has seen exponential growth in recent decades while diagnostics that aim at the unique diseases and conditions affecting infants and children lag significantly behind .

Analysis of salivary cell-free DNA may provide similar insight and be highly beneficial in children affected by cancer who are already undergoing countless needle sticks and invasive procedures.

Conversely there is a growing body of research examining salivary metabolomics that may predict metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes and obesity in children.

Interestingly there have also been recent studies showing aberrant protein expression in the saliva of children affected with autism spectrum disorder.
