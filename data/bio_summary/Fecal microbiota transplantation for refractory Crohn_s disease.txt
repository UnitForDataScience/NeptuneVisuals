It is characterized by progressive trans- mural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract which often leads to structuring or penetrating complications requiring surgical resection.1 Although the etiology of the disease remains unclear CD involves interactions among genetic susceptibility environmental factors antigens derived from commensal bacteria intestinal microbiota and the immune system.2 Over the past decades the incidence and preva- lence of CD have gradually increased in Asian countries including Korea.1 Conventional treatment for CD is based on the administration of aminosalicylates corticosteroids andimmunosuppressants prior to escalation to biological thera- pies in particular those using tumor necrosis factor-a anti- bodies.3 However approximately one-third of patients do not respond to these treatments some experience significant adverse effects such as serious infections and lymphoma and many patients require surgery.4Increasing evidence suggests that specific changes in the composition of gut microbiota termed dysbiosis are a com- mon feature in patients with IBD including UC and CD.2 Dysbiosis can lead to activation of the mucosal immune sys- tem resulting in chronic inflammation and the development of mucosal lesions.

In one study 75 patients with mild-to-moderate UC were ran- domized to weekly FMT or placebo water via retention en- ema for 6 weeks and the patients who received FMT had a significantly greater remission rate than that of those receiv- ing the placebo 24 vs. 5.14 In addition a microbiomic analysis showed that patients who received FMT had greater microbial diversity than those who received the placebo.

Six months after transplantation of a healthy donor stool by retention enema he remained symptom-free and active inflammation was not detected during a follow-up biopsy sampling of the colon.11 Initial case studies of FMT enemas in patients with IBD reported that many of the pa- tients achieved clinical remission and maintained long-term remission and a small number of these cases also reported endoscopic and histological remission.12 However subse- quent small case series of FMT in children and adults with UC CD or pouchitis showed mixed results.6 Despite the demonstrated safety and efficacy of FMT for IBD in these case studies the available evidence is scarce and insufficient as these studies were underpowered and open-labeled and a lack of uniformity exists among FMT protocols and defined outcomes.6 Moreover the patient populations wereheterogeneous in disease type and severity phenotype and concomitant medications.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 stud- ies nine cohort studies eight case studies and one random- ized controlled trial on FMT that included 122 patients with IBD 79 UC 39 CD and four unclassified demonstrated a clinical remission rate of 45.5 However the pooled estimate for achieving short-term clinical remission after FMT was 36.2 after excluding case studies to minimize publication bias.

However the high pooled estimates for clinical remission in patients with CD or in young patients were significantly heterogeneous which considerably limits the applicability of these conclusions.

The other study enrolled 50 patients with mild-to-moderately active UC and randomized them to either donor stool or au- tologous FMT delivered via a nasoduodenal tube at baseline and again 3 weeks later.15 Only 37 patients completed the as- sessment for primary endpoint-clinical remission combined with a 1-point decrease in the Mayo endoscopic score at week 12.

Increasing evidence suggests that specific changes in the composition of gut microbiota termed as dysbiosis are a common feature in patients with inflammatory bowel disease IBD.

Clinical course of CRP and CDAI during medical therapy.DISCUSSIONFMT also referred to as stoolfecal transplantation or fecal bacteriotherapy is the infusion or engraftment of fecal liquid filtrate from a healthy donor into the gut of a recipient to cure a specific disease.6 The concept of FMT for treatment of hu- man intestinal diseases was described in China during 4th century and human fecal suspension by mouth was used to treat patients who had food poisoning or severe diarrhea.7 Although it was first reported in 19588 it has only recently become popular due to its success in treating refractory and recurrent C. difficile infections CDI.

Recent studies have shown that FMT is an effective treatment in recurrent CDI with a 90 success rate and it can be considered as an anti- biotic replacement for recurrent and refractory CDI that has relapsed more than three times.9Although no definitive pathogen has been detected as the etiologic factor of IBD many studies have investigated the disturbance of intestinal microbiota as a contributing factor to IBD pathogenesis.4 Consistent alterations in intestinal mi- crobiota in IBD are characterized by decreased diversity at the species level with notable decreases in the Bacteroides phylum and Lachnospiraceae group within the Firmicutes phylum and increases in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.6 In addition a decrease in a butyrate-producing bacterium which is important in intestinal health has been observed in patients with IBD.10 However it is still unclear whether dysbiosis itself causes IBD or if it represents an epiphenom- enon due to microbial alterations as a consequence of the disease.4The application of FMT for IBD was first published in 1989 as a case report in which the author himself had confirmed UC for 7 years that was refractory to both sulfasalazine and steroids.

In addition the pooled estimate for clinical remission was highest 64.1 in young patients aged 7-20 years.
