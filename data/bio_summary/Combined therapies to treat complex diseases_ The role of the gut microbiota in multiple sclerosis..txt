faeces pbmcs and serum of originally iden- tified cis patients and even ris patients could provide essential infor- mation regarding the following questions i are there differences in gut microbiota composition between ms patients and hcs before clini- cally defined ms ii what is the nature of these gut microbiome chang- es iii how early can gut dysbiosis be detected prior to clinically defined ms iv what are the microbiome features that characterize re- lapse and remission phases v what is the specific dmt effect on dis- ease activity and how is it connected with gut microbiome modificationin addition to identifying specific microbiome signatures as potentialpathogenic events and biomarkers for the clinical course of ms e.g.

some of these dysbiotic features were also observed in adult ms patients significantly higher concentrations of bifidobacteriaceae and lower concentrations of bacteroidaceae .more specifically the enrichment of the pro-inflammatory enterobacte- riaceae family and methanobrevibacter genus and depletion of scfa- producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory psa-producing bacteroides fragilis observed in paediatric cases  some of which were also ob- served in adult ms patients  could partially explain the inflammato- ry features associated with ms pathogenesis and its clinical course.finally as was previously performed in studies of adult ms patients  tremlett and collaborators analysed stool and pbmcs from 15 pa- tients and nine hcs in order to connect ms inflammatory features with gut dysbiosis in paediatric ms patients .

b recent data also indicate that environmental risk factors for ms can modify gut microbiome composition and can be associated with pathogenic gut dysbiosis suggesting that the gut microbiota could be the greatest risk factor for ms. c likewise patients with ms also present altered intestinal permeability .

gf mice had increased bbb permeability and their tjs appeared as diffuse disorganized structures compared with spf mice a. however when gf mice were colonized with a spf microbiota or clostridium strains or treated with scfas the mice exhibited decreased bbb permeability which returned to near-normal levels a .

gut microbiota removal might trigger complex and severe consequences since the symbiotic gut microbiota plays essential roles in host health-related processes such as defence against pathogen colonization renewal and mainte- nance of the gut barrier nutrient metabolism e.g.

thus it could be hypothesized that i the release of systemic cytokines such as il-10 or tgf-b1 could favour treg cell differentiation outside the gut or that ii treg cells once differentiated in the gut as a result of probiotic treatment mi- grate from the gut to the periphery.

this is why gut dysbiosis studies should be done as early as possible after the onset of ms or even before its onset at the clinically isolated syndrome cis and radio- logically isolated syndrome ris stages  to isolate gut microbiota ef- fects from other confounders activated systemic immune pathways dmts or altered gut motility and constipation.

moreover it would also be interesting to assess to what extent ms-related environmental risk factors such as epstein-barr virus infec- tion smoking adolescent obesity salt intake or vitamin d deficiency can influence the gut microbiota composition and gut dysbiosis  b. in this way dysbiotic populations that are unrelated to these con- founders due to their influence on gut microbiota composition and ms  could be identified and studied to determine their pathogen- ic role in ms. furthermore prospective studies with clinical follow-up and sample gathering e.g.

thus as gut microbiome composition can be modified by multiple environmental factors including ms risk factors not only does the commensal micro- biota reflect host exposure to non-genetic risk factors but its modifica- tion could be highly involved in host immune responses and ms pathogenesis.commensal microbiota studies in the eae modelthe commensal microbiota is a key factor in the development and clin- ical course of eaesince experimental studies showed that the eae incidence in germ- free gf and antibiotic-treated mice was significantly lower than that in specific pathogen-free spf animals the gut micro- biota has been studied as a potential environmental factor contributing to the experimental disease.

likewise larger and longitudinal studies could identify ms subtype-spe- cific gut dysbiosis profiles related to pathogenic immune responses which could be used as both diagnostic and relapse risk biomarkers.although bacterial richness in ms patients is slightly diminishedcompared with that in hcs  statistically significant results regarding an overall gut community shift have not been obtained .

finally as i3s could not be detected in gf mice the authors concluded that dietary trp together with commensal microbi- ota metabolism are needed to modulate the activity of cns-resident cells not only astrocytes and neuroinflammation c. moreover ahr regulation by ifn-b suggested that the microbiome might affect not only the development of cns autoimmunity but also the cns re- sponse to disease-modifying therapies .the commensal microbiota is an environmental risk factor and potential biomarker in msafter experimental data revealed the role of the gut microbiota in eae pathogenesis ms clinical research began to show differences re- garding commensal microbiota populations between ms patients and hcs.

later as had been previously ob- served in adult cases  treated paediatric patients presented a more similar gut microbiota to hcs than untreated patients .

if these hypotheses were confirmed the gut microbiota could be used as a biomarker when choosing the optimal immunomodulatory treatment andor help clinicians to understand why some of their patients fail to respond to a particular drug.in our opinion the immunomodulatory properties of several probiotics prebiotics and bacteria-associated molecules among others should be used to develop adjuvant treatments that complement cur- rently available therapeutic choices for ms patients.

likewise the similarity between microglia from antibiotic-treated spf mice and gf mice demonstrates that continuous inputs of gut microbiota stimuli are essential to maintaining a proper mature microglia phenotype.

however when gf mice were monocolonized with a specific non-pathogenic member of the commensal microbiota seg- mented filamentous bacteria th17 responses were augmented and the clinical signs of eae were more severe compared with gf mice with- out monocolonization .although beneficial effects on the clinical course of eae were ob- served in gf and antibiotic-treated mice the clinical translation of these approaches might be complicated.
