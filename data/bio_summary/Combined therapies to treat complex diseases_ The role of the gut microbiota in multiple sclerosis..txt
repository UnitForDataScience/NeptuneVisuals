Because MS is a complex disease with a large va- riety of associated environmental risk factors we suggest that current treatments combined with strategies that modulate the commensal microbiota would constitute a broader immunotherapeutic approach and improve the clinical outcome for MS patients.c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Thus studying the gut microbiota in the early stages of MS would not only avoid confounders but also provide evidence connecting specific gut microbiota to MS pathogenesis.Because the risk of developing MS is clearly associated with environ-mental factors limited exposure to MS-related environmental risk fac- tors would indicated a causal role for the commensal microbiota in disease pathogenesis.

We propose that therapeutic approaches should include currently approved DMTs together with commensal microbiota modulation and other immunomodulatory molecules such as vitaminIn fact combined therapies should be used to impact not only the gut microbiota but also other MS-related environmental risk factors.Take-home messagesMultiple sclerosis is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system and arises from the interaction of both genetic and environmental factors.Gut microbiota is essential to triggering autoimmune demyelinationit can modulate the host immune system it alters the integrity and function of biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier and it has a direct effect on several types of central nervous system-resi- dent cells.A characteristic gut dysbiosis is suggested as a relevant feature in pa-tients with multiple sclerosis.Specific microbiome signatures could be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical outcome or disease-modifying treatment efficacy in multi- ple sclerosis.The immunomodulatory properties of several probiotics prebiotics and bacteria-associated molecules could be used as adjuvant treat- ments for multiple sclerosis patients.FundingThis work was supported by the Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria FIS PI1500840 Instituto de Salud Carlos III Ministry of Economy and Competitivity MINECO Spain.Declaration of conflicting interestsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.References

faeces PBMCs and serum of originally iden- tified CIS patients and even RIS patients could provide essential infor- mation regarding the following questions i Are there differences in gut microbiota composition between MS patients and HCs before clini- cally defined MS ii What is the nature of these gut microbiome chang- es iii How early can gut dysbiosis be detected prior to clinically defined MS iv What are the microbiome features that characterize re- lapse and remission phases v What is the specific DMT effect on dis- ease activity and how is it connected with gut microbiome modificationIn addition to identifying specific microbiome signatures as potentialpathogenic events and biomarkers for the clinical course of MS e.g.

Moreover altered BBB permeability could also have conse- quences in some perivascular cells such as astrocytes neurons and guard microglia which are important mediators of BBB integrity inphysiological conditions .CNS-resident cells are affected by the commensal microbiota in the EAE modelAlthough peripheral immune regulation by the gut microbiota has been widely described in the EAE model recently published datashow that the host microbiota not only affects CNS tissue via CNS-infil- trating immune cells but also has a direct effect in CNS cells.

Finally as I3S could not be detected in GF mice the authors concluded that dietary Trp together with commensal microbi- ota metabolism are needed to modulate the activity of CNS-resident cells not only astrocytes and neuroinflammation C. Moreover AHR regulation by IFN-b suggested that the microbiome might affect not only the development of CNS autoimmunity but also the CNS re- sponse to disease-modifying therapies .The commensal microbiota is an environmental risk factor and potential biomarker in MSAfter experimental data revealed the role of the gut microbiota in EAE pathogenesis MS clinical research began to show differences re- garding commensal microbiota populations between MS patients and HCs.

Thus as gut microbiome composition can be modified by multiple environmental factors including MS risk factors not only does the commensal micro- biota reflect host exposure to non-genetic risk factors but its modifica- tion could be highly involved in host immune responses and MS pathogenesis.Commensal microbiota studies in the EAE modelThe commensal microbiota is a key factor in the development and clin- ical course of EAESince experimental studies showed that the EAE incidence in germ- free GF and antibiotic-treated mice was significantly lower than that in specific pathogen-free SPF animals the gut micro- biota has been studied as a potential environmental factor contributing to the experimental disease.

Gut microbiota removal might trigger complex and severe consequences since the symbiotic gut microbiota plays essential roles in host health-related processes such as defence against pathogen colonization renewal and mainte- nance of the gut barrier nutrient metabolism e.g.

This is why gut dysbiosis studies should be done as early as possible after the onset of MS or even before its onset at the clinically isolated syndrome CIS and radio- logically isolated syndrome RIS stages  to isolate gut microbiota ef- fects from other confounders activated systemic immune pathways DMTs or altered gut motility and constipation.
