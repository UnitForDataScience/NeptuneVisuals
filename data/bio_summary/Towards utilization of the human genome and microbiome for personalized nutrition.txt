Importantly community changes imposed by diet can be predicted with important ramifications on the prospect of dietary interventions  dramatic dietary alterations indeed impact the micro- biome structure more subtle changes may not  demonstrating potential microbiome resilience to some less dramatic dietary changes as indicated by Korem et al.

This astounding rise in the prevalence of closely asso- ciated diseases constituting the 'metabolic syndrome' carries significant global medical and economic conse- quences .The disappointing efficacy of dietary interventions to obesity and its complications may stem from lack of regard to inter-individual variabilities in dietary responses .

While both may be used for a person-specific diagnosis and stratification of dietary responses and recommenda- tions the microbiome is also amenable to modulation by approaches such as pro-biotics pre-biotics antibiotic treatment and recently post-biotic intervention thereby representing an exciting new potential for preventive and interventional modification of personalized dietary responses.Human genomeSuccessful full genome characterization by the Human Genome project  was followed by additional large collaborative efforts to characterize human geneticvariation including the International HapMap consor- tium  the Human Variome Project  and the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium .

Machine learning algorithms utilize these comprehensive data sets to deliver dietary recommendations.of genomic contribution to dietary planning in the context of multi-factorial diseases are sparse and include enhanced benefits of Mediterranean diet in preventing breast cancer risks in patients carrying SNPs in GST1 glutathione S-transferase 1 and Nat2 N-acetyltransfer- ase 2 of the xenobiotic metabolism pathway .

Available online at ScienceDirectTowards utilization of the human genome and microbiome for personalized nutrition Stavros Bashiardes44 Eran Elinav5 5Generalized dietary and lifestyle guidelines have been formulated and published for decades now from a variety of relevant agencies in an attempt to guide people towards healthy choices.

Recent technological advances have given an unprecedented insight into the sources of this variation pointing towards our genome and microbiome as potentially and previously under-explored culprits contributing to individually unique dietary responses.

In parallel concerted efforts have focused on determining the components constituting a healthy and beneficial diet and on educating the public on healthy dietary practices along generalized lines.

Of note is that the US government has been publishing dietary guidelines and advice for over a century with no less than 900 publications guidance and educational during that time U.S. Department of Agriculture URL .

Indeed a recent realization is that some of themetabolic responses to diet differ from one individual to another as exemplified by cholesterol metabolism and postprandial hyperglycemia risk factors for cardiovascu- lar disease CVD and type 2 diabetes  and by recent studies demonstrating that not all individuals respond in the same way to changes in lifestyle and this certainly applies to dietary changes .

Epidemiological nutritional studies have suggested an association between diet and chronic diseases revolutionizing the field of nutritional research by incorporating individual genetic information  and giving rise to a new area of study namely nutrige- nomics that is the study of how our genes influence dietary intake.
