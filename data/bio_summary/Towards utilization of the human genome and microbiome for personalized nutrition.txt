importantly community changes imposed by diet can be predicted with important ramifications on the prospect of dietary interventions  dramatic dietary alterations indeed impact the micro- biome structure more subtle changes may not  demonstrating potential microbiome resilience to some less dramatic dietary changes as indicated by korem et al.

this astounding rise in the prevalence of closely asso- ciated diseases constituting the 'metabolic syndrome' carries significant global medical and economic conse- quences .the disappointing efficacy of dietary interventions to obesity and its complications may stem from lack of regard to inter-individual variabilities in dietary responses .

while both may be used for a person-specific diagnosis and stratification of dietary responses and recommenda- tions the microbiome is also amenable to modulation by approaches such as pro-biotics pre-biotics antibiotic treatment and recently post-biotic intervention thereby representing an exciting new potential for preventive and interventional modification of personalized dietary responses.human genomesuccessful full genome characterization by the human genome project  was followed by additional large collaborative efforts to characterize human geneticvariation including the international hapmap consor- tium  the human variome project  and the 1000 genomes project consortium .

machine learning algorithms utilize these comprehensive data sets to deliver dietary recommendations.of genomic contribution to dietary planning in the context of multi-factorial diseases are sparse and include enhanced benefits of mediterranean diet in preventing breast cancer risks in patients carrying snps in gst1 glutathione s-transferase 1 and nat2 n-acetyltransfer- ase 2 of the xenobiotic metabolism pathway .

available online at sciencedirecttowards utilization of the human genome and microbiome for personalized nutrition stavros bashiardes44 eran elinav5 5generalized dietary and lifestyle guidelines have been formulated and published for decades now from a variety of relevant agencies in an attempt to guide people towards healthy choices.

recent technological advances have given an unprecedented insight into the sources of this variation pointing towards our genome and microbiome as potentially and previously under-explored culprits contributing to individually unique dietary responses.

in parallel concerted efforts have focused on determining the components constituting a healthy and beneficial diet and on educating the public on healthy dietary practices along generalized lines.

of note is that the us government has been publishing dietary guidelines and advice for over a century with no less than 900 publications guidance and educational during that time u.s. department of agriculture url .

indeed a recent realization is that some of themetabolic responses to diet differ from one individual to another as exemplified by cholesterol metabolism and postprandial hyperglycemia risk factors for cardiovascu- lar disease cvd and type 2 diabetes  and by recent studies demonstrating that not all individuals respond in the same way to changes in lifestyle and this certainly applies to dietary changes .

epidemiological nutritional studies have suggested an association between diet and chronic diseases revolutionizing the field of nutritional research by incorporating individual genetic information  and giving rise to a new area of study namely nutrige- nomics that is the study of how our genes influence dietary intake.

currently the only form of effective treatment for galactosemia is galactose restriction.despite the efficiency exemplified in the above mono- genic disorders in using genomics for dietary recommen- dations adaptation of genomic diagnostics and stratifica- tion tools in tailoring diets for the prevention and treatment of chronic polygenic complex diseases such as cancer cvd obesity and type 2 diabetes has proven much more complicated and of limited value.

examplesfigure 1rationally designed personalized dietary approaches determine the effects of numerous parameters on diet response e.g.

a randomized trial following 7018 participants found mediterranean diet to decrease fasting glucose and lipids and reduced the incidence of stroke in tt homozygote individuals .however the many other claimed nutrigenomics approaches of effectively influencing dietary choices among the general population at risk have mostly proven to be non-evidence based.

it is indicative that the largest intervention study to date comparing the effect of pn on health related dietary behavior showed the advantage of pn advice based on individual baseline diet and lifestyle over a conventional approach.

the intra-personal difference in the circulation of tmao when consuming tmao precursors is a function of gut microbiome with people who showed greater tmao response having the higher ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes .another example is of flavonoids polyphenolic com- pounds found in numerous dietary components including vegetables and fruits.
