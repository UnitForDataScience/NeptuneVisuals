However autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms may respond to ocean warmingdifferently leading to changes in the ocean's metabolic balance  .Nitrogenous nutrient scarcity tends to limit primary production of the phytoplankton communities throughout much of the low-latitude surface ocean  .

Global warming increases the temperature of boththe surface ocean and the ocean's interior       thus it may negatively influence the rate of nitrite oxidation in certain environments of the ocean.

With the impact of global warming the surface ocean is becoming warmer and more stratified aggravating the spatial decoupling of deep ocean nutrients and surface ocean photosynthetic CO2 fixation.Aerobic ammonia oxidation by AOA has been found as one of the highest energy-yielding chemolithotrophic processes in high temperature environments such as hot springs     .

The advent of new techniques may bring the dawn to scientific breakthroughs that necessitate the multidisciplinary combination of eco-energetic biogeochemical and omics studies in this field.Keywords carbon cycle chemolithoautotrophy energy metabolism global change global warming nitrogen cycle ocean acidification ocean deoxygenationChemolithoautotrophic Microbiota to Changes in the MarineEnvironment.

This effect may lower phytoplankton primary productivity and thus the export of particulate organic matter POM from the surface ocean to the deep ocean and sediments    .

Under the combined influences of ocean acidification and global warming the chemical composition of the ocean's nitrogenous nutrient reservoir may be altered.

The lowered nitrate pool due to ocean acidification- and warming-induced decrease of nitrification may lower diatoms-mediated primary production and POC-mediated carbon sequestration of the ocean but increase the incidences of harmful algal blooms by dinoflagellates.Although certain soil AOB and AOA strains such as Ca.

In summary ocean acidification may cause altered likely decreased nitrification increased N2O emission and increased loss of nitrogenous nutrients via enhanced denitrification and anammox among many other significantly altered biogeochemical processes in the ocean.

AOA constitute the most abundant functional group of microorganisms in the ocean's mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones     and they play a major role in nitrification and dark carbon fixation in the interior of the ocean        .

Rapid increase in CO2 emission as a result of fossil fuel consumption has led to various environmental problems such as global warming ocean acidification and ocean hypoxia.
