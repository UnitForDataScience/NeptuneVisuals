All yeast recovered from the blood and organs of vehicle and 5 mgkg CSF-treated mice contained wild-type sequences for FKS1 and FKS2 hot spots while yeast recovered from the organs of 20 mgkg CSF-treated mice exhibited an Fks2 amino acid substitution and .

In panels A and B 5 mgkg and 20 mgkg data are depicted in the left and right graphs respectively.high-dose 20 mgkg caspofungin resulted in significantly reduced GI burdens but drug levels within the GI tract were not maintained at a high level for a sufficiently long time potentially creating a niche to allow drug adaptation of C. glabrata for regrowth and priming cells for potential resistance acquisition.Systemic dissemination from GI colonization upon immunosuppression.

The burdens of the0.5 and 5 mgkg groups were unchanged  and FKS mutants Fks2-S663P and Fks2-P667T were recovered from only one mouse 10 in the 5 mgkg treatment group.

As expected treatment with high-dose 20 mgkg caspofungin caused greater drug penetration into the GI tract than that with the therapeutic dose 5 mgkg large intestine mean Cmax 36.2 versus 3.8 ugml respectively small intestine mean Cmax 22.2 versus 9.1 ugml respectively although the GI drug concentrations were significantly lower than the plasma levels .

From these data we conclude that daily administration ofFIG 2 A single dose of 20 mgkg caspofungin causes greater drug penetration into the GI tract and further reduces GI yeast burdens than that of the therapeutic dose 5 mgkg.

of 5 mgkg or 20 mgkg caspofungin.

Yeast were recovered from at least one organ in 70 60 and 30 of vehicle 5 mgkg CSF-treated and 20 mgkg CSF-treated miceFIG 3 Echinocandin treatment alters breakthrough rates that are successfully achieved following dexamethasone immunosuppression.

with vehicle control PBS 5 mgkg CSF or 20 mgkg CSF as described in panel A.

Mice treated with both nikkomycin 100 mgkg oral and high-dose caspofungin 20 mgkg i.p.

Fungal burden levels and resistance rates depended on levels of drug in the GI tract the lower therapeutic dose 5 mgkg of caspofungin had no effect on burden and resulted in low resistance rates while the high caspofungin dose 20 mgkg resulted in a reduction in burden levels but high resistance rates.
