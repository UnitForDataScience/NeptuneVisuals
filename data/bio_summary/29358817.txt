moreover tibetan kefir composition differs from that of russian kefir irish kefir taiwan kefir turkey fermented beverage with kefir however it is known that this microbial diver- sity is responsible for the physico-chemical features and biological activities of each kefir jianzhong et al.

some probiotic characteristics of a fermented milk product based on microbiota of ''tibetan kefir grains'' cultivated in ukrainian householdmykola kukhtyn1  olena vichko1 yulia horyuk2  olga shved3 volodymyr novikov3revised 27 september 2017  accepted 15 october 2017  published online 7 november 2017c association of food scientists  technologists india 2017abstract the article describes some probiotic properties of fermented product made of natural association of tibetan kefir grains cultivated in ukrainian household utkg also the effect of utkg microbiota on the growth of pathogenic microbiota and sensitivity to antibi- otics was studied.

despite the fact that lactococci strains were also acid-resistant and then appeared to be non-resistant to gastric juices.conclusionit was established that bacteria of fermented milk product made of utkg microbiota showed high antagonistic activity to a. niger and p. vulgaris bacteria bacteriostatic zone made 28 - 1 mm and 26 - 1 mm respectively b. cereus m. luteum and s. aureus with bacteriostatic zone from 21 to 23 mm were sensitive to the microbiota ande.

it was found that the test-cultures of oppurtunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus bacillus mesentericus and mycobacterium luteum were sensitive bacteriostatic zone of the test-culture ranged from 21 to 25 mm and highly sensitive proteus vulgaris and asper- gillus niger bacteriostatic zone exceeded 25 mm to pro- biotic bacteria of fermented product.

milk supplements based on tibetan kefir grains tkg that mentioned in local ukrainian sources as lactomyces tibeticus--culture association of microorganisms are of significant interest due to wide range of biologically active compounds relatively simple cultivation and possibility of maintaining the culture active for a long time yelinov and larina  kukhtyn et al.

it proves microbial association to be capable of withstanding adverse gastrointestinal conditions and continue developing.keywords tibetan kefir grains  fermented product probiotic bacteriaintroductionthe preparations made of beneficial bacteria namely lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria have been increasingly used both in general medicine and veterinary medicine in recent years.

utkg microbiota is also moderately sensitive to multiple antibiotics that allows defining the obtained fermented milk product as functional with therapeutic properties.
