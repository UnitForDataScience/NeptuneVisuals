The diameter of bac- teriostatic zones of test-cultures less than 15 mm means insensitive microorganism 16-20 mm--moderately sen- sitive 21-25 mm--sensitive 26 mm and more--highly sensitive.Defining of antibiotic resistance of the studied fermented dairy product The suspension of the culture extracted from UTKG association 106 CFUcm3 was prepared first.

Note The diameter of bacteriostatic zones of test-cultures less than 15 mm means insensi- tive microorganism 16-20 mm--moderately sensitive 21-25 mm-- sensitive 26 mm and more--highly sensitiveThe resistance of ''beneficial'' microorganisms to antibiotics allows using with maximum benefit for the body the products with probiotic properties during antibiotic therapy Fernandez et al.

UTKG microbiota was moderately sen- sitive to multiple antibiotics chloramphenicol20.5 - 0.5 mmbacteriostaticzonegentamicin--15.5 - 0.5 mm amoxicillin--16.5 - 0.5 mm strepto- mycin--18.5 - 0.5 mm penicillin--16.55 - 0.5 mm kanamycin--10.55 - 0.5 mm.

Despite the fact that lactococci strains were also acid-resistant and then appeared to be non-resistant to gastric juices.ConclusionIt was established that bacteria of fermented milk product made of UTKG microbiota showed high antagonistic activity to A. niger and P. vulgaris bacteria bacteriostatic zone made 28 - 1 mm and 26 - 1 mm respectively B. cereus M. luteum and S. aureus with bacteriostatic zone from 21 to 23 mm were sensitive to the microbiota andE.

Some probiotic characteristics of a fermented milk product based on microbiota of ''Tibetan kefir grains'' cultivated in Ukrainian householdMykola Kukhtyn1  Olena Vichko1 Yulia Horyuk2  Olga Shved3 Volodymyr Novikov3Revised 27 September 2017  Accepted 15 October 2017  Published online 7 November 2017c Association of Food Scientists  Technologists India 2017Abstract The article describes some probiotic properties of fermented product made of natural association of Tibetan kefir grains cultivated in Ukrainian household UTKG also the effect of UTKG microbiota on the growth of pathogenic microbiota and sensitivity to antibi- otics was studied.

It was found that the test-cultures of oppurtunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus Bacillus mesentericus and Mycobacterium luteum were sensitive bacteriostatic zone of the test-culture ranged from 21 to 25 mm and highly sensitive Proteus vulgaris and Asper- gillus niger bacteriostatic zone exceeded 25 mm to pro- biotic bacteria of fermented product.

The fermented milk produced using UTKG contains 108-109 CFUcm3 of yeast and 104 CFUcm3 of viable lactic acid bacteria.

The fermented product including UTKG only as starter culture was obtained by introducing 2.5-5 of UTKG association inoculum insterile cow milk with milk fat content 2.5.

The study revealed that bacteria of fermented pro- duct show resistance to unfavourable gastrointestinal factors 4.0 sodium chloride concentration in culture medium 20 bile concentration 0.5 phenol concentra- tion the number of viable cells L. fermentum and Lacto- bacillus spr.

The lumps are formed of round or oval curded granules of 1-3 mm with uneven surface.
