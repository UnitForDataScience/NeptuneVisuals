Root and leaf associated communities were found to have more with-in group variance or dispersion than sediment communities p  0.001 which could indicate that stabilizingCategoryDiversity metricPseudo-FR2P permselection is acting on these sediment communities.

However leaf and root microbial communities do not differ significantly based on sampling location possibly indicating that these plant tissue associated communities are more stable than the sediment communities in regards to location.

Although we speculate that plant microbe interactions are important for seagrasses little is known about how the roles of microbial communities associated with marine plants may affect plant health and what abiotic and biotic factors affect the composition of these communities.

One possible explanation for the correlation between the sediment communities and eelgrass shoot density may be the release of exudates and oxygen by the roots of the eelgrass which would increase in concentration with eelgrass density.Random forest analysis confirmed differences between sediment microbial communities taken from the inside of the patch the edge and unvegetated sediment from outside the patch .

This is further supported by a recent study which focused on surface-associated communities that observed that the microbiomes of seagrass and seaweed species were host specific but had broad-scale functional similarities  .Differences in microbial communities between sample types leaves roots and rhizosphere sediment and possible functional implications We used a Bonferroni corrected Kruskall-Wallis test to test for differences in relativeabundance of the orders between sample types.

Thiotrichales which are enriched in the sediment are generally filamentoussulfur-oxidizing bacteria  and are postulated to be dominant sulfur-oxiders in salt marsh sediments .Variation in sediment microbial communities between locationsThe analysis of diversity metrics reported above also showed that there are significant differences in the sediment microbial communities from different locations inside a eelgrass patch the edge of a patch and outside of a patch.

The abundance of Myxococcales inside the eelgrass patch aligns with the expectation of higher prevalence of organic matter degradation inside the patch as opposed to surrounding unvegetated sediment.Environmental drivers of sediment communitiesIn addition to investigating the taxonomic composition of the microbial communities of sediment collected from the inside edge and outside of eelgrass patches we decided to test for correlations between observed community differences and environmental factors to elucidate key factors that may be driving the microbial communities in eelgrass patches.A variety of abiotic factors were significantly different between locations including CN ratio TIC dissolved oxygen pH and sediment size fractions 710 um and 63 um ANOVA p  0.05 and .

Major findings include that distinct microbial communities are associated with the leaves and roots of the plant sediment associated communities are correlated with host plant densityand specific microbial taxa are found to have high relative abundances on particular tissues.
