partic- ipants n  5928 were examined 1982-1992 and under- went abdominal ultrasound examination to detect gallstone disease and were not informed of their gallstone status.

future studies should explore the link between gallstone and cardiovascular disease further and gut microbiota may be a candidate mechanism.keywords apolipoproteins  cholelithiasis  gallbladder diseases  gallstones  longitudinal studies  ultrasonographybackgroundwhether there is a causal association between gallstone disease and cardiovascular disease cvd has been debated for centuries.

studies on gallstone prevalence incidence mortality and clinical follow-up have been published before   -.the explanatory variable was gallstone disease proven by ultrasound or cholecystectomy.

significant associations were defined by a 95 ci not including 1. each analysis of outcome was performed in two sets one with gallstone disease included as a three-level categorical variable gallstones at ultrasound cholecystec- tomy and no gallstones and one with gallstone disease yes no included as a dichotomous variable.

the studypopulation n  5496 included 90.8 without gallstone disease and 9.2 with gallstone disease of which 6.3 had gallstones and 2.9 had had a cholecystectomy fig.

the probability of having died due to other causes than cvd competing event at 30 years of follow-up for no gallstone disease gallstone disease gallstones and cholecystectomy were 22.8 36.0 35.3 and 36.8 respectively.

the changes in choles- terol metabolism following cholecystectomy seem to affect the liver however the results of this study do not support these changes to have an independent association with cvd but support that gallstone disease itself is associated with cvd.previous cohort studies of clinical gallstone disease have reported positive associations with coronary artery   - and cerebrovascular disease   .

the assessment of gallstone disease through ultrasound exam- ination has high sensitivity and specificity for gallstone detection  minimizing misclassification bias.
