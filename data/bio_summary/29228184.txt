This complexity has inspired a new discipline of synthetic microbial ecology Dolinsek Goldschmidt and Johnson .The gut microbiota has been a remarkable ecosystem to es- tablish and validate the basic methods of large-scale metage- nomic analysis of complex microbial assemblies.

The former addressed metagenomic analy-sis of the gut microbiota of hundreds of individuals and the latter addressed metagenomic analysis of the various ecosys- tems that together constitute the global microbiota of several individuals.For microbiologists used to focus on a single microbe inter- acting with a given environment such as a bacterial pathogen engaging host cells and tissues it has been a formidable change in scale and a two-step challenge from one species to a com- munity in a single environment or host ca.1000 species in the human gut to a collection of genomes generating astronomic numbers of genes to comprehend ca.

Response to perturbations such as diet changes and antibiotic use are ways to function- ally address the dynamics of microbial ecology in the gut and to provide orientations for interventions aimed at reconstitut- ing a healthy microbiota following the occurrence of dysbiotic alterations Shetty et al.

Synthetic microbial ecology emerges as a potent approach to breakdown the global network of interactions in a complex microbiota into functional units in competition.

This opens a largely new facet of ecology providing strong bases for modeling Abreu and Taga .A way to deal with complexity is synthetic microbial ecology that emerges as an approach designing assembling and ana- lyzing the dynamics of ecological circuits encompassing subsets of interacting microbial genotypes.

Synthetic microbial ecol- ogy and the dynamic interplay between microbial genotypes.

This is particularly obvi- ous when trying to correlate OTU or gene composition of gut microbiota with health or various diseases such as obesity type 2 diabetes or inflammatory bowel diseases Cotillard et al.

It now bears on thousands of individual gut microbiota that have undergone metasequencing analysis.

Dietary intervention impact on gut microbiota gene richness.
