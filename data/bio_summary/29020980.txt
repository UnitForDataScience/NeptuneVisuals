Thus if these genes were to become mobilized and spread to pathogenic bacteria they may constitute a threat to human health in the future Furthermore the large increase in known chromosomal B1BL genes will enable more detailed phylogenetic studies of the B1 subclass of metallo-b-lactamases an essential step to further elucidate the evolution and origins of mobile B1BL genes.The phylogenetic analysis showed that 9 out of the 10 known mobile B1BL gene families clustered together with chromosomal B1BL genes in Proteobacteria groups B1-1 and B1-2 the only exception was SPM-1.

From sequences that were present in NCBI RefSeq bacteria consisting of 2744 complete genomes and 162 draft genomes 92 B1BL genes were predicted Table In total 88 genomes 3.2 and 2 plasmids carried one B1BL gene and one genome carried two B1BL genes Shewanella denitrificans strain OS217.

In addition to the B1BL gene the insert also contained a gene encoding the pro- tein domain NERD associated with endonucleases previ- ously found on virulence plasmids as well as genes belonging to the FicDOC domain family pfam02661 previously connected with a toxin-antitoxin module from the E. coli prophage P1 .Among the NCBI RefSeq plasmids consisting of 9225 sequences we predicted 148 B1BL genes of which 147 were associated with previously known gene families Table One identified gene located on a plasmid from Myroides odoratimimus strain PR63039 had a sequence identity lower than 70 to any previously described B1BL.

In addition the P. stutzeri DSM 10701 strain which was predicted to contain a novel B1BL gene yielded a positive Carba NP test.The 76 predicted and previously uncharacterized B1BL genes clustered into 59 novel families Additional file Table S1 resulting in a total of 81 B1BL families described to date.

While the hosts of the B1-1 group all belonged to the Alpha- and Deltaproteobacteria the identified hosts of the B1-2 group all belonged to the taxonomic class Gammaproteobacteria with the genus Shewanella accounting for 67 of the genes.Table 3 Summary of the 22 experimentally verified B1BL genesThe third group B1-3 consisted of 25 novel B1BL families and one previously characterized B1BL family CcrA.

All mobile B1BL families except for SPM were located in the two Proteobacteria-associated groups indicating that the clinically important mobile B1BL genes originated in Proteobacteria and that in the future the host range for mobile B1BL genes acquired by pathogens may be lim- ited.

We found however no association between the distribution of B1BL genes and human-associated bacteria or pathogens as defined by the PATRIC database p  0.8695 and p  0.6021 respectively.Among the predicted B1BL genes in RefSeq bacteria one was located on the chromosome of Pseudomonas stutzeri DSM 10701.

This plasmid also harbored the gene tetX which confers resistance to tetracycline and tigecycline another last-resort broad-spectrum antibiotic  and genes associated with class B type IV secre- tion systems TraMB  The analysis of the NT and EnvNT GenBank databases resulted in the identification of 959 additional predicted B1BL genes bringing the total number predicted B1BL genes to 1199 correspond- ing to 266 non-redundant sequences Table .

Special priority was given to metagenomes from heavily polluted environments which have previously been shown to contain a high abundance and diversity of resistance genes The relative abundance of B1BL gene fragments ranged from 13.8 to 79.0 B1BL fragments per million metagenomic fragments Fig.
