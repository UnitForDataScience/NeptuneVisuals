thus if these genes were to become mobilized and spread to pathogenic bacteria they may constitute a threat to human health in the future furthermore the large increase in known chromosomal b1bl genes will enable more detailed phylogenetic studies of the b1 subclass of metallo-b-lactamases an essential step to further elucidate the evolution and origins of mobile b1bl genes.the phylogenetic analysis showed that 9 out of the 10 known mobile b1bl gene families clustered together with chromosomal b1bl genes in proteobacteria groups b1-1 and b1-2 the only exception was spm-1.

from sequences that were present in ncbi refseq bacteria consisting of 2744 complete genomes and 162 draft genomes 92 b1bl genes were predicted table in total 88 genomes 3.2 and 2 plasmids carried one b1bl gene and one genome carried two b1bl genes shewanella denitrificans strain os217.

we found however no association between the distribution of b1bl genes and human-associated bacteria or pathogens as defined by the patric database p  0.8695 and p  0.6021 respectively.among the predicted b1bl genes in refseq bacteria one was located on the chromosome of pseudomonas stutzeri dsm 10701. this gene was found to be mostclosely related to the previously identified mobile b1bl gene khm-1 54 amino acid sequence identity.

in addition to the b1bl gene the insert also contained a gene encoding the pro- tein domain nerd associated with endonucleases previ- ously found on virulence plasmids as well as genes belonging to the ficdoc domain family pfam02661 previously connected with a toxin-antitoxin module from the e. coli prophage p1 .among the ncbi refseq plasmids consisting of 9225 sequences we predicted 148 b1bl genes of which 147 were associated with previously known gene families table one identified gene located on a plasmid from myroides odoratimimus strain pr63039 had a sequence identity lower than 70 to any previously described b1bl.

in addition the p. stutzeri dsm 10701 strain which was predicted to contain a novel b1bl gene yielded a positive carba np test.the 76 predicted and previously uncharacterized b1bl genes clustered into 59 novel families additional file table s1 resulting in a total of 81 b1bl families described to date.

while the hosts of the b1-1 group all belonged to the alpha- and deltaproteobacteria the identified hosts of the b1-2 group all belonged to the taxonomic class gammaproteobacteria with the genus shewanella accounting for 67 of the genes.table 3 summary of the 22 experimentally verified b1bl genesthe third group b1-3 consisted of 25 novel b1bl families and one previously characterized b1bl family ccra.

all mobile b1bl families except for spm were located in the two proteobacteria-associated groups indicating that the clinically important mobile b1bl genes originated in proteobacteria and that in the future the host range for mobile b1bl genes acquired by pathogens may be lim- ited.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.metallo-b-lactamases can be phylogenetically divided into three subclasses b1 b2 and b3 metallo-b- lactamases from subclass b1 b1bl and subclass b3 use two zinc ions within their active sites and have a much broader resistance spectrum compared to subclass b2 which uses only one zinc ion furthermore the vast majority of the mobile class b carbapenemases identified to date belong to subclass b1 including the clinically important imp for active on imipenem and vim verona integron-encoded metallo-b-lactamase gene families that are commonly found in integrons transpo- sons and plasmids the more recently identified b1bl gene family ndm new dehli metallo-b- lactamase first discovered in 2009 on a plasmid in a klebsiella pneumoniae strain has spread globally in the span of only a few years and today is found in multidrug-resistant bacteria in many countries  underscoring the increasing clinical importance of surveillance of carbapenemases from the b1 subclass.environmental and commensal bacterial communities are known to maintain a large diversity of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes  this diver- sity is known to be especially large in environments with an antibiotic selection pressure such as environments polluted with antibiotics from the production of phar- maceuticals and wastewater treatment plants -in addition to the already known resistance genes bacterial communities also harbor a wide range of novel resist- ance determinants that have yet to be encountered in clinical settings - if mobilized these genes may be transferred to pathogens either directly or indirectly via commensal bacteria in humans or animals which can lead to infections that are difficult or impossible to treat .

this plasmid also harbored the gene tetx which confers resistance to tetracycline and tigecycline another last-resort broad-spectrum antibiotic  and genes associated with class b type iv secre- tion systems tramb  the analysis of the nt and envnt genbank databases resulted in the identification of 959 additional predicted b1bl genes bringing the total number predicted b1bl genes to 1199 correspond- ing to 266 non-redundant sequences table .

special priority was given to metagenomes from heavily polluted environments which have previously been shown to contain a high abundance and diversity of resistance genes the relative abundance of b1bl gene fragments ranged from 13.8 to 79.0 b1bl fragments per million metagenomic fragments fig.

the levels were significantly higher in the environmental metagenomes compared to the human microbiometable 1 summary of the analyzed genome datasets and predicted b1bl genesabased on a sequence similarity cut-off of 70bnon-redundant genestable 2 summary of the analyzed metagenomes and predicted b1bl genesabased on a sequence similarity cut-off of 70p  0.0167 wilcoxon rank sum test.

however our results indicate that many of the identified fragments are false positives and that there is likely no single widespread previously uncharacterized b1bl gene in the human microbiomes investigated.the identification of novel b-lactamases was based on a probabilistic profile hidden markov model hmm designed to identify novel b1bl gene families.
