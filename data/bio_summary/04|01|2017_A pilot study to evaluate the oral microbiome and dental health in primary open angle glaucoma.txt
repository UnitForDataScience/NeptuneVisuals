among these genera the amounts of streptococci were significantly higher among cases 45.5 compared to controls 38.8 p0.023 t-test table 4.at the species level while present in 100 of cases and controls the amounts of streptococcus mitis were higher in cases compared to controls p0.027 t-test and accounted for 26 of all bacteria in cases and for 17.6 of the bacteria in controls.in addition although the neisseria genus was present in 80 of case samples and 65 of the control samples p0.05 amounts of the neisseria meningitidis polysaccharea species were higher among cases compared to controls p0.005 mann-witney u test as amounts did not follow the normal distribution and this species was one of the species that was more prevalent among cases compared with controls detected in 53.6 of cases and 5.9 of controls p0.0012 fisher's exact test.two additional species actinomyces graevenitzii actinomyces massiliensis also differed between cases and controls with lower frequency of actinomyces graevenitzii 52.9 vs. 89.3 and higher frequency of actinomyces massiliensis 52.9 vs. 14.3 in the cases p0.0109 and p0.0083 respectively although the  amounts that these species represented in samples of both groups was rather low ranging between 0.08 and 1.in an analysis based on glaucoma cases only the total amount of oral bacterial load was not correlated with the mean deviation md of the worst eye of individual glaucoma cases p0.05.

however 51.6 4995 of cases vs 32.7 1752 of controls were male p0.04 fisher's exact test table 1. no other factors evaluated differed between the two groups p0.05 for all comparisons - see table 1.dental healthself-reported dental health parameters are summarized in table 2. although the mean -sd total number of natural teeth was lower in cases compared to controls 18.0 -11.12 and20.7 -9.44 respectively the difference did not reach statistical significance p0.14 t-polla et al.page 6test.

there were also no significant age or sex differences p0.05 t-test and fisher's exact test respectively between cases and controls in this subsample.we have previously reported 21 that the total amount of normalized oral bacterial loads nobl was significantly higher among cases compared to that of controls in a larger cohort of subjects.

the prevalence of each particular bacterial genus as percentage of subjects with a positively identified genus within the total number of subjects in a group among cases and controls was similar p0.05 chi-square test.the seven genera that contributed the most to the total amount of bacterial load of cases and controls are shown in table 3 with each contributing on average at least 3 to the total oral bacterial load in both groups.

this observation suggests that there is an inverse relationship between having more teeth and the odds of having poag that increases with increasing age providing support for the hypothesis that chronic dental infections may affect glaucomatous neurodegenerationpolla et al.page 821. in addition results of an exploratory analysis in a small subset of cases and controls showed increased amounts of streptococci in the oral cavity of cases compared to that of controls lending support to the possibility that specific commensal bacteria may be responsible for this effect.the study population was recruited from an urban population where african-americans are over-represented and where glaucoma is highly prevalent.

to explore this novel hypothesis we conducted a pilot case control study to compare dental health data and levels of different bacterial strains from the ocular microbiome in glaucoma cases and controls without glaucoma.methodsthis case-control study adhered to the tenets of declaration of helsinki and was conducted in compliance with hipaa regulations.

control group eligibility required having no current or past iop elevation iop21 mmhg no prior use of iop lowering medications no significant onh asymmetry cdr difference  0.2 and had cdrs0.5 in both eyes as determined by the examining physician.an attempt was made whenever possible to group match within 5 years the age of the controls to that of the cases with the balance between groups monitored on a weekly basis and adjustments made as needed.

after informed consent was obtained a full clinical examination which included gonioscopy and dilated fundus examination was performed on all subjects cases and controls by the examining physician.

following the clinical examination subjects both cases and controls were provided with 30cc of scope tm mouthwash solution and asked to take the mouthwash into their mouth swish for 30 seconds and spit in a sterile cup.

de-identified demographic data as well as corresponding clinical data and questionnaire responses were entered into a database for statistical analysis.sample preparation and analysistotal dna from a randomly selected subset of african-american subjects 28 cases and 17 controls was isolated at the laboratory of one of the co-authors a.g using a bead beater as previously described 22 quantified using a nanodrop nd-1000 spectrophotometer and frozen until analysis.

negative controls 1ul of water instead of template dna were run for each plate in duplicate.

bacterial load counts in cases compared with those in controls after log transformation have been reported in an earlier publication21.preparation of 16s rrna gene amplicon libraries and sequencingoligonucleotide primers targeting both the v1-2 and v4 hypervariable regions were designed based on previously described bacterial universal primers.

clusters with 25 or more members were identified and classified as previously described 24. the data were normalized as percent of total for each taxon for each sample and taxa averaged for the v1 and v4 sequences.statistical analysisfrequencies and distributions of possible risk factors were compared between glaucoma cases and controls using chi square testing for comparison of categorical variables.continuous variables were compared using the t-test or the mann-whitney u test depending on the type of distribution.

cumulative tobacco exposure was also compared across groups using the t-test.factors with a difference between cases and controls that reached a significance level of p0.15 on univariate screen were included in multivariate analyses using a logistic regression model that also included age and gender as covariates.

separate age-adjusted analyses were also performed among cases based on disease severity mild to moderate mean deviation md in the most affected eye -15db versus severe md in the most affected eye -15db.in order to determine which genera were significantly different in amount between cases and controls we compared the amount of each genus in a subset of poag case and control samples using t-tests.
