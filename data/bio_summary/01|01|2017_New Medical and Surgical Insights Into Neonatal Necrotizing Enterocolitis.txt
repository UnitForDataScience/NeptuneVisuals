it has been demonstrated that operatively identified86jama pediatrics january 2017 volume 171 number 1spontaneous intestinal perforation has a mortality rate of 19 in vlbw neonates roughly half of the rate for surgically treated nec 35. nonetheless this mortality rate is significantly higher than the 5 mortality rate in neonates with neither nec nor spontane- ous intestinal perforation.39 in the setting of congenital heart dis- ease there is an additive effect on mortality with mortality for com- bined nec and congenital heart disease being significantly higher than overall mortality for either entity individually combined mor- tality 55 congenital heartdisease mortality 34 nec mortality 28.40 current work is being performed to quantify outcomes in similar patients with gastroschisis and nec.other outcomes of interest specific to surgically treated nec include the development of long-term intestinal failure intestinal failure or short bowel syndrome.

using nonculture-based techniques specifically polymerase chain reaction recent studies have shown that preterm infants have very different microflora than full-term neonates with a predomi- nance of more pathogenic organisms and a paucity of commensal organisms.1213 similar to the microflora in full-term infants the flora in preterm infants is quite variable in the first 2 weeks before it ma- tures into a more consistent and predictable pattern.

furthermore some bio- markers appear to portend a more severe presentation possibly indicating those infants at high risk of requiring surgical intervention.specifically urinary intestinal fatty acid-binding protein a marker for cell wall integrity damage has been reported to be significantly higher in infants diagnosed with nec compared with unaffected con- trols.

furthermore intestinal fatty acid-binding protein levels were significantly higher in infants diagnosed with nec who either re- quired surgery or died as a result of disease compared with those who did not.20 elevations in claudin-3 a tight junction protein were similarly elevated in patients with nec in the same study indicat- ing loss of intestinal wall integrity.

a separate study25 similarly used fecal calprotectin and urinary intestinal fatty acid- binding protein levels to establish the diagnosis of nec in preterm infants presenting with clinical suspicion of the disease.as the above studies demonstrate there are many candidate biomarkers that may help differentiate nec from other benign neo- natal intestinal morbidities and can aid in prognostication for the se- verity of disease.

thus the higher odds ratios of mortality in infants with surgically treated nec are notably more pronounced at higher birth weights.in addition necrotizing enterocolitis is an umbrella diagnosis ap- plied to other clinical scenarios such as spontaneous intestinal perforation37 ischemic intestinal pathophysiology seen in congen- ital heart disease38 and pneumatosis and bowel injury associated with gastroschisis.

in 1999 gewolb et al11 sampled stool specimens from extremely low-birth-weight infants and using cul- ture-based methods showed that patients had minimal diversity by age 10 days with only 3 different bacterial species identified in most infants.

most of the reported studies have described trajectories of biomarker lev- els following the diagnosis of nec in an effort to discriminate infants with sepsis andor nec from infants with feeding intolerance or ex- acerbation of other neonatal morbidities.

re- cent evidence suggests that nec results from an altered intestinal microbiome that activates an uncontrolled proinflammatory response.3 in preterm infants this proceeds briskly without ad- equate anti-inflammatory regulation.

finally we analyze current evidence for surgical intervention on the outcome.jama pediatrics january 2017 volume 171 number 183the microbiome dysbiosis in preterm infants and the effect on necin older children and adults intestinal microflora consists of tril- lions of cells with thousands of bacterial strains with significant and balanced diversity.

a recent study by azad et al10 dem- onstrated that even at age 4 months intestinal flora differed be- tween infants' diet and delivery method yetby 1 year of life the flora between individuals becomes much more similar.flora differs significantly between the preterm infant and thefull-term neonate and these differences are proposed to contrib- ute to the development of nec in part by activation of unbalanced proinflammatory signaling.

separately plasma levels of inter-a inhibitor protein which helps regulate systemic inflamma-84jama pediatrics january 2017 volume 171 number 1tion were significantly lower in infants with nec compared with in- fants with nonspecific abdominal pathology.21 several reports have described elevations in fecal calprotectin a marker for intestinal in- flammation.

of note because of the broad range of this review we have chosen not to cover certain aspects of the disease including the controversial topic of transfusion- associated nec but other reviews have previously covered this entity.28 we will now shift the focus of this review toward surgical management of infants affected by nec.indications for surgerysurgical indications for nec are the presence of intestinal perfora- tion or clinical deterioration in the face of maximal medical manage- ment.

intestinal microbiota of preterm infants differ over time and between hospitals.
