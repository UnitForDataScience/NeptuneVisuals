therefore the increase of butyrate found in the vessel 2 inoculated with the microbiota of a celiac donor could be of interest and deserves further efforts and experiments.moreover the increase of acetic and propionic acids is interesting as they also act as anti-inflammatory compounds could play a role in the stimulation of the immune system and decrease the ph of the colon indirect antimicrobial effect  .the multivariate approaches and the nipals algorithm also suggest that the effect of gfb could also rely on the initial equilibrium of the fecal microbiota and the positive effect could result in a different modulation of the microorganisms and scfa in the present study in the fecal microbiota of a celiac donor a pronounced effect on bif was found while the fecal microbiota of the other celiac donor experienced a significant effect on lactobacillusenterococcus.in conclusion this in vitro work provides encouraging findings supporting the utilization of gf products with a positive effect on the fecal microbiota and scfas from celiac donors.

gfb exerted a strong effect on the fecal microbiota of the celiac donor 2 as suggested by the shift from c2-v1 acids and fecal microbiota of the celiac donor 2 in the first vessel to c2-v2 and c2-v3.

these results were found within 48 h thus in the present study stool samples were collected from celiac and healthy volunteers in order to better understandthe differences in microbiota composition and metabolic activity induced by gfb after a prolonged supplementation and in a system able to simulate the whole colon.significant increases in bifidobacterial numbers were observed in response to gfb in the fecal microbiota of healthy and celiac donors.

in addition the use of multivariate approaches showed that the supplementation of gfb could result in a different modulation of the fecal microbiota and scfa as a function of initial equilibrium.keywords gluten friendly bread fecal microbiota celiac healthy gut modelintroductionthe composition and the metabolism of human microbiota play crucial roles in human health.

on the other hand the same effect was not found in the vessels inoculated with the fecal microbiota of the celiac donor 1. a modification of the system was also found in the vessels inoculated with the fecal microbiota of healthy donor 1 as a slight shift toward right was found from v1 to v2-v3.this first approach suggests that gfb could induce a shift and a modification of the ecosystem however due to the high number of the leading variables nine the accounted variability explained by the statistic is quite low ca.

in addition the use of multivariate approaches showed that the supplementation of gfb could result in a different modulation of the fecal microbiota and scfa as a function of initial equilibrium of the microbiota.the experiments were done on fecal slurries from two healthy and two celiac donors thus the results are as a kind of preliminary evidence and should be confirmed and validated on a larger number of samples and by an in vivo human intervention study.

this study investigated the in vitro effects of gf bread gfb on the fecal microbiota from healthy and celiac individuals by a three-stage continuous fermentative system which simulates the colon vessel 1 proximal colon vessel 2 transverse colon and vessel 3 distal colon as well as on the production of short chain fatty acids scfa acetate propionate butyrate.

the rapid heating and subsequent slow evaporation of the water was repeated until reaching a final temperature of 80-90c which was measured by a thermal camera fluke i20 model italy and a moisture degree of 13- 13.5 in the wheat grains.after microwave treatment the wheat kernels were cooled and dried at room temperature 24c for 12-24 h and then ground using an automatic laboratory mill mcka buhler ag uzwilswitzerland diameter of grid 118-180 um  .gluten friendly bread was prepared according to the bread- making process 100 g wheat flour 66 ml water 1.33 g yeast 1 g salt to the chorleywood bread process  .simulated in vitro human digestionprior to being added to the in vitro colonic system gfb was digested in vitro under appropriate conditions according to the procedures described by  to mimic mouth stomach and intestine's condition.fecal samples collection and inocula preparationfecal samples were obtained from two healthy and two celiac donors male and female aged 30-50 years old who were free of any metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases were not taking probiotic or prebiotic supplements and had not taken antibiotics 6 months before fecal sample donation.

a significant increase in numbers of bacteria within the bifidobacterium genus was found fecal microbiota of celiac donors showed a significant increase in this population from 8.42 to 8.90 log cfuml p  0.05 and from 8.60 to 9.20 log cfuml p  0.05 in v2 and v3 respectively transverse and distal colon.

in the fecal samples of healthy volunteers there was a significant increase in numbers of bifidobacteria bif in v3 from 7.90 to 8.40 log cfuml p  0.05. significant increases were also found in numbers of bacteria in all vessels for celiac volunteers in clostridium cluster population from 8.85 to 9.50 v1 from 9.1 to 9.60 v2 and from 9.00 to 9.50 log cfuml v3 p  0.05 ere.the results of scfas are in .

regarding the fecal microbiota of celiac volunteers significant increases of propionic production were found in v1 and v2 from 45.10 to 69.20 p  0.01 and from 50.80 to 70.20 mm p  0.05 respectively also acetic acid showed a significant increase in v1 from 41.20 to 89.00 mm p  0.01.multivariate approachthe last approach was a focus on the multivariate differences induced by the supplementation of gfb.

0.4 log cfuml.the most important differences were found for the fecal microbiota of the celiac donors in the donor 2 there was a shift from vessel 1 to vessels 2 and 3 probably due to bif.
