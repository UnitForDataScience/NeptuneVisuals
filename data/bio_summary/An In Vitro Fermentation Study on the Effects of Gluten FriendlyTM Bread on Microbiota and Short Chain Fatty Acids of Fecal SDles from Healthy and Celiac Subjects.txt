Therefore the increase of butyrate found in the vessel 2 inoculated with the microbiota of a celiac donor could be of interest and deserves further efforts and experiments.Moreover the increase of acetic and propionic acids is interesting as they also act as anti-inflammatory compounds could play a role in the stimulation of the immune system and decrease the pH of the colon indirect antimicrobial effect  .The multivariate approaches and the NIPALS algorithm also suggest that the effect of GFB could also rely on the initial equilibrium of the fecal microbiota and the positive effect could result in a different modulation of the microorganisms and SCFA in the present study in the fecal microbiota of a celiac donor a pronounced effect on BIF was found while the fecal microbiota of the other celiac donor experienced a significant effect on LactobacillusEnterococcus.In conclusion this in vitro work provides encouraging findings supporting the utilization of GF products with a positive effect on the fecal microbiota and SCFAs from celiac donors.

GFB exerted a strong effect on the fecal microbiota of the celiac donor 2 as suggested by the shift from c2-v1 acids and fecal microbiota of the celiac donor 2 in the first vessel to c2-v2 and c2-v3.

These results were found within 48 h thus in the present study stool samples were collected from celiac and healthy volunteers in order to better understandthe differences in microbiota composition and metabolic activity induced by GFB after a prolonged supplementation and in a system able to simulate the whole colon.Significant increases in bifidobacterial numbers were observed in response to GFB in the fecal microbiota of healthy and celiac donors.

In addition the use of multivariate approaches showed that the supplementation of GFB could result in a different modulation of the fecal microbiota and SCFA as a function of initial equilibrium.Keywords Gluten Friendly bread fecal microbiota celiac healthy gut modelINTRODUCTIONThe composition and the metabolism of human microbiota play crucial roles in human health.

In addition the use of multivariate approaches showed that the supplementation of GFB could result in a different modulation of the fecal microbiota and SCFA as a function of initial equilibrium of the microbiota.The experiments were done on fecal slurries from two healthy and two celiac donors thus the results are as a kind of preliminary evidence and should be confirmed and validated on a larger number of samples and by an in vivo human intervention study.

This study investigated the in vitro effects of GF bread GFB on the fecal microbiota from healthy and celiac individuals by a three-stage continuous fermentative system which simulates the colon vessel 1 proximal colon vessel 2 transverse colon and vessel 3 distal colon as well as on the production of short chain fatty acids SCFA acetate propionate butyrate.

Cross-reactivity towardthe antibodies recognizing almost the entire range of gluten proteins as well as the antigenic epitopes through the sequences QQSF QQSY PEQPFPQGC and QQPFP was significantly reduced.This study aimed to investigate the impact of the administration of GF bread GFB on the fecal microbiota of healthy and celiac volunteers using a three-stage continuous culture colonic model system.

The rapid heating and subsequent slow evaporation of the water was repeated until reaching a final temperature of 80-90C which was measured by a thermal camera Fluke i20 Model Italy and a moisture degree of 13- 13.5 in the wheat grains.After microwave treatment the wheat kernels were cooled and dried at room temperature 24C for 12-24 h and then ground using an automatic laboratory mill MCKA Buhler AG UzwilSwitzerland diameter of grid 118-180 um  .Gluten Friendly bread was prepared according to the bread- making process 100 g wheat flour 66 mL water 1.33 g yeast 1 g salt to the Chorleywood Bread Process  .Simulated In Vitro Human DigestionPrior to being added to the in vitro colonic system GFB was digested in vitro under appropriate conditions according to the procedures described by  to mimic mouth stomach and intestine's condition.Fecal Samples Collection and Inocula PreparationFecal samples were obtained from two healthy and two celiac donors male and female aged 30-50 years old who were free of any metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases were not taking probiotic or prebiotic supplements and had not taken antibiotics 6 months before fecal sample donation.

The gut model is often used to resemble the complexity and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and simulates the proximal vessel 1 V1 80 mL pH 5.5 transverse vessel 2 V2 100 mL pH 6.2 and distal colon vessel 3 V3 120 mL pH 6.8  the vessels were filled with fecal homogenate from healthy and celiac volunteers 20 and a complex colonic growth medium 80.

A significant increase in numbers of bacteria within the Bifidobacterium genus was found fecal microbiota of celiac donors showed a significant increase in this population from 8.42 to 8.90 log CFUmL p  0.05 and from 8.60 to 9.20 log CFUmL p  0.05 in V2 and V3 respectively transverse and distal colon.
