feeding the lso diet resulted in an in- creased crude fat intake p  0.001 intake of indi- vidual fa p  0.001 and intake of total fa p  0.001 compared with the con diet table 2. these results are in line with the difference in chemical com- position between the lso diet and con diet linseed oil increased the dietary fat content from 34 to 56 g kg of dm table 1. the lso diet 2.3 linseed oil on dm basis increased apparent total-tract digestibility of crude fat compared with the con diet p  0.001table 2. the effect of dgat1 k232a polymorphism aa or kk on intake and apparent total-tract digestibility of nutrients of lactating dairy cows fed diets with lso or without con linseed oildietdgat1 genotypep-valuebut the apparent total-tract digestibility of the other nutrients was unaffected table 2. the increased crude fat digestibility of the lso diet may have been the result of ufa from linseed having a higher total-tract digestibility than sfa van zijderveld et al.

an increase in c181 trans-10 in milk is gen- erally associated with milk fat depression and occurs when low fiber diets or diets supplemented with pufa- rich plant oils are fed resulting in a shift in rumen microbial composition and a changed biohydrogenation pathway griinari and bauman 1999. in the present study milk fat content  decreased but intake of ndf and starch ruminal ph and milk fat yield gd were unaffected with the lso diet tables 2 3 and 7. the increase of c181 trans-11 was greater comparedwith c181 trans-10 as the c181 trans-11 to c181trans-10 ratio increased with the lso diet i.e.

taken together these results suggest that the effect of linseed oil on nutrient digestibility may vary with the source of forage in the basal diet the forage to concentrate ratio as well as the amount of linseed oil added.lactation performance and milk fatty acid profileno diet x dgat1 interaction effect on milk produc- tion and milk composition was observed.

permanova results tended to be affected by diet p  0.081 but was not affected by dgat1 p  0.326 and diet x dgat1 interaction p  0.365. we also individually analyzed the relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal genera to examine if these were affected by diet dgat1 and diet x dgat1 interac- tion table 8. this was done because changes in taxa of low relative abundance can be masked when the total rumen microbiota is analyzed as a whole.methanobrevibacter was the most abundant archaealgenus which is in line with other studies e.g.

the lso diet resulted in a decreased energy loss in the form of ch4 p  0.022 table 5 and an increased mei to gei ratio p  0.006 table 5. the decreasing effect of linseed oil on energy loss in the form of ch4 together with the tendency of reduced ge digestibility may explain the difference in mei to gei ratio because the gei was unaffected by feeding linseed oil table 5. the mean n balance was not affected by diet dgat1 and diet x dgat1 interaction table 5. milk n effi- ciency tended p  0.076 to be higher for the dgat1 aa genotype 26.6 compared with the dgat1 kk genotype 25.5. a few studies have reported the ef- fect of dietary linseed oil on n balance and were re- viewed by hristov and jouany 2005. these authors indicated that the effects of fat supplementation on the n balance of cattle are inconsistent in the literature.

2008. this is not confirmed by the results of the present study table 3. in the present study compared with the dgat1 aa genotype fat yield of the dgat1 kk genotype was only numerically higher 1180 vs. 1102 gd and protein yield numerically lower 874 vs. 900 gd.the lso diet resulted in a decreased milk fat con- tent milk protein content and mun p  0.045 table 3. the decrease in milk protein content was also ob- served by benchaar et al.

the dgat1 kk genotype was associated with a lower proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk fat and with a higher milk fat and protein content and proportion of saturated fatty acids in milk fat com- pared with the dgat1 aa genotype whereas the fat- and protein-corrected milk yield was unaffected by dgat1.

many studies also reported the k allele to be associated with a higher fat yield and lower protein yield although the reduced protein yield is nottable 3. the effect of dgat1 k232a polymorphism aa or kk on milk production and milk composition of lactating dairy cows fed diets with lso or without con linseed oildietdgat1 genotypep-value1fat- and protein-corrected milk  0.337  0.116 x fat   0.06 x protein  x milk yield kgd.consistently reported e.g.

the aforementioned anova analysis was also used to de- termine the effect of diet dgat1 and diet x dgat1 interaction on the relative abundance of individual bacterial and archaeal genera that were 1 consistent in all animals and 2 were 0.05 in terms of relative abundance.results and discussionintake and digestibility of nutrientsnutrient intake dmi fatty acid fa intake and apparent total-tract digestibility of nutrients were not affected by dgat1 polymorphism and diet x dgat1 interaction.

4.6- 0.19 for the con diet and 6.0 - 0.46 for the lso diet p  0.009. this indicates a change in the ru- men biohydrogenation pathway potentially the result of the increased rumen ufa load lock 2010 causing changes in microbiota composition or activity and thus changes in ruminal fermentation characteristics.energy and nitrogen retentionno diet x dgat1 interaction was observed for the energy balance characteristics of the cows table 5. the me intake mei to gei ratio was lower for the dgat1 kk genotype 66.8 compared with the dgat1 aa genotype 67.9 p  0.023. to the best of our knowledge the effects of dgat1 on energy bal- ance measured in crc have not been quantified previ- ously.

2009 as a result of rumination and the consequent entry of saliva.the proportions of the individual vfa were unaffect- ed by dgat1 and diet x dgat1 interaction table 7. feeding the lso diet resulted in an increased propor- tion of propionate p  0.010 whereas the proportion of acetate and the acetate to propionate ratio decreased compared with the con diet p  0.004 and p  0.001 respectively.

2015. both of the de- tected archaeal genera in this study were unaffected by diet dgat1 and diet x dgat1 interaction with the exception of methanobrevibacter for which a tendency for a diet x dgat1 interaction was observed.

2013 and the significant- ly higher milk n efficiency with the lso diet 27.5 compared with the con diet 24.6 discussed in the energy and nitrogen retention section is in line with the decrease in mun.

2008.the lso diet resulted in lower contents of all odd- and branched-chain fa in milk compared the con diet p  0.004 table 4. this is in line with chilliard et al.
