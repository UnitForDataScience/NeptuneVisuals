The DGAT1 KK genotype was associated with a lower proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk fat and with a higher milk fat and protein content and proportion of saturated fatty acids in milk fat com- pared with the DGAT1 AA genotype whereas the fat- and protein-corrected milk yield was unaffected by DGAT1.

The aforementioned ANOVA analysis was also used to de- termine the effect of diet DGAT1 and diet x DGAT1 interaction on the relative abundance of individual bacterial and archaeal genera that were 1 consistent in all animals and 2 were 0.05 in terms of relative abundance.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIntake and Digestibility of NutrientsNutrient intake DMI fatty acid FA intake and apparent total-tract digestibility of nutrients were not affected by DGAT1 polymorphism and diet x DGAT1 interaction.

Taken together these results suggest that the effect of linseed oil on nutrient digestibility may vary with the source of forage in the basal diet the forage to concentrate ratio as well as the amount of linseed oil added.Lactation Performance and Milk Fatty Acid ProfileNo diet x DGAT1 interaction effect on milk produc- tion and milk composition was observed.

The major effect of DGAT1 on milk production traits has been often observed with the K allele associated with a higher milk fat and protein content but lower milk production than the A allele e.g.

2013 and the significant- ly higher milk N efficiency with the LSO diet 27.5 compared with the CON diet 24.6 discussed in the Energy and Nitrogen Retention section is in line with the decrease in MUN.
