Dysbiosis and alterations of the intestinal microbiota composition contribute to the develop- ment and progression of many diseases in humans including inflammatory bowel disease for review see 15 16 type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM 1718 obesity for review see 19 20 cardiovas-cular disease events 21 22 autism 23 24 forreview see 24 depression for review see 25 26 Parkinson's disease 27-29 for review see 28 and multiple sclerosis 30 31.

The intesti- nal microbiota is required for distinct functions that are known to be beneficial for host health includ- ing maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity inhibition of pathogen adhesion to intestinal sur- faces vitamin K synthesis energy salvaging from unabsorbed food by short-chain fatty acid SCFA production and regulation and proper maturation of the immune system for review see 6 7.The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is connected via neu- ral immune endocrine and metabolic pathways for review see 8-11.

In this review we discuss the role of the gut microbiome in AD and summarize the studies from both animals and humans demonstrating the contribution of intesti- nal bacteria on cognitive dysfunction specifically the development of AD.BACKGROUND ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASEAD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and is clinically characterized by progres- sive cognitive impairment which commences with a deterioration in memory for review see 32.

An arguably effective therapy for treat- ing patients with Clostridium difficile infection 71 72 for review see 72 FMT has also shown favorable outcomes in extra-intestinal diseases asso- ciated with intestinal dysbiosis for review see 73 74.

Aging is associated with an overstimulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems resulting in a low-grade chronic state of inflammation defined as inflammaging for review see 86 87 which may increase gut permeability leaky gut and bacterial translocation for review see 88 89.

Additionally during aging the blood-brain barrier BBB is compromised 96-99 for review see 96 99 which can not only influence the clear- ance of A13 from the brain but also the secretome and receptor-mediated signaling involved in the neu- roinflammation that is observed in AD for review see 100.

The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in the development of AD.

The bacterial density of human gut microbiota is up to 1012 per mL which is the highest density in any known microbial ecosystem for review see 1 2.

The human microbiome has been estimated to encode approximately 4 106 genes which collectively out- numbers the 26600 human genes by about 150 to 1 3-5 for review see 4 5.
