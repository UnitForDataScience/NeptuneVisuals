doi10.1136bmjopen-2017-0183131these disorders have a strong genetic basisthere is increasing evidence suggesting that environmental risk factors during prenatal development may also play a role.in support of this a population-based study conducted on a swedish population estimated that genes and environmental exposure each contribute approxi- mately half of the overall risk of asd with this 5050 contribution remaining consistent across the study's 24-year span.furthermore recent work demonstrated focal patches of abnormal laminar architecture and laminar disorganisation in the prefrontal and temporal cortices of children with asd suggesting there may be alterations in brain development at prenatal stages as cortical lamination is ongoing during the second trimester of pregnancy.

studies that report similar adjustments will be analysed separately in crude and adjusted models to assess poten- tial confounding among studies that reported adjusted estimates.a fixed-effects model will be used where heterogeneity is low i2 value of less than 50 and a random-effects model where heterogeneity is high i2 value of 50 or more according to the cochrane handbook criteria.we will also perform the following subgroupsensitivity analyses where the data allow using revman 5.3according to study design cohort vs case-control vs cross-sectionalaccording to studies that report estimates for the asso- ciation between pre-eclampsia and gestational hyper- tension and each neurodevelopmental disorderaccording to location eg europe vs usaaccording to income level of country lowmiddle highaccording to study quality minimallow vs moder- atehighaccording to measurement of exposure and outcome data self-reported vs medical records based on varying clinical coding systems.publication bias will be assessed using a funnel plot provided at least 10 or more studies are included in the meta-analysis.

two authors will independently review the titles and abstracts of all studies perform data extraction using a standardiseddata collection form and assess study quality using a bias classification tool.

registration crd42017068258.introductionhypertensive disorders of pregnancy hdps are the most common complications of preg- nancy estimated to affect approximately 5-15 of all pregnancies.hdps are clas- sified into four categories as recommended by the international society for the study strengths and limitations of this studyof hypertension in pregnancy 'chronic hypertension' 'gestational hypertension' 'pre-eclampsia--de novo or superimposed on chronic hypertension' and 'white coat hyper- tension'.

conversely other studies have reported no associationhighlighting the need for further study in this area.

the systematic review will be based on the following requirementspopulationpregnant women and their children.interventionexposureshdp.primary exposure pre-eclampsia.secondary exposure other hdp.comparisonno diagnosis of hdp.outcomesprimary outcome 1 asd.primary outcome 2 adhd.secondary outcomes other neurodevelopmental disorders.methods and designthis systematic review and meta-analysis will follow the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines.objectivesthis study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between hdp and neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring.review questionthis systematic review will address the following research questionwhat are the pooled estimates from existing literature examining the association between hdp and neurodevel- opmental disorders in the offspringcriteria for considering studies for the review inclusion criteria we will include cohort case-control or cross-sectional studies in which a diagnosis of hdp was reported and neurodevelopmental disorders are the outcome of interest.

examining the association between hdp and neurodevelopmental disorders must be part of the main objective of the study.

data must be from an original study and hdp may be confirmed through medical records or doctor-di- agnosed self-reporting.

where consensus on eligibility cannot be achieved a third review author gwok will be involved in the discussion.data extraction and managementusing a standardised data collection form two reviewers gmm and gwok will independently extract data from the eligible studies including the author and year of publication study design definition of exposure and outcome used sample size confounders adjusted for if any as well as crude and adjusted estimates.

discrepan- cies will be resolved by a third reviewer ask if necessary.appraisal of the quality of included studiesquality assessment of the included studies will be conducted by two reviewers gmm and pmk inde- pendently and agreed on subsequently using an appro- priate quality assessment tool depending on the study design.

study bias is then classified as minimal low moderate high or not reported for each of the six types of bias and an overall likelihood of bias based on the total of the six types of bias will be measured andreported.

for example selection bias will be minimised if the sample was taken from a 'consecutive unselected population' while conversely a study with high selection bias will arise if sample selection is ambiguous and the sample is not likely representative.data synthesis including assessment of heterogeneitywhere the data allow meta-analyses will be performed to calculate overall pooled estimates of the relationship between combined hdp pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension and different disorders of neurodevelop- ment.

adjustment will be based on the definition outlined in each identified study and a hierarchy of adjustment created depending on the factors that are adjusted for.

where any other subgroup sensitivity analyses are identified in the process of the meta-analysis such as analyses to explore potential high heterogeneity or publication bias these will be clearly labelled as post hoc analyses.presenting and reporting the resultsa flow diagram as outlined in the prisma statement will be included to outline the study selection process step by step and a rationale provided for excluded studies.

where a study is eligible for inclusion in the systematic review but does not provide adequate data to include in a meta-analysiswe will contact the corresponding authors in an attempt to obtain raw data where appropriate.
