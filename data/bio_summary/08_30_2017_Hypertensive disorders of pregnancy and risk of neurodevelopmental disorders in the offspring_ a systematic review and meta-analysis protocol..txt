The full search strategy is included in online 1.Searches of the electronic databases will be supplemented by hand-searching the reference lists of included studies for further potentially eligible studies.Selection of studies for inclusion in the reviewTitles and abstracts of studies retrieved from each data- base search will be stored and managed in EndNote refer- ence manager.

Studies that report similar adjustments will be analysed separately in crude and adjusted models to assess poten- tial confounding among studies that reported adjusted estimates.A fixed-effects model will be used where heterogeneity is low I2 value of less than 50 and a random-effects model where heterogeneity is high I2 value of 50 or more according to the Cochrane Handbook criteria.We will also perform the following subgroupsensitivity analyses where the data allow using RevMan 5.3according to study design cohort vs case-control vs cross-sectionalaccording to studies that report estimates for the asso- ciation between pre-eclampsia and gestational hyper- tension and each neurodevelopmental disorderaccording to location eg Europe vs USAaccording to income level of country lowmiddle highaccording to study quality minimallow vs moder- atehighaccording to measurement of exposure and outcome data self-reported vs medical records based on varying clinical coding systems.Publication bias will be assessed using a funnel plot provided at least 10 or more studies are included in the meta-analysis.

Due to limited resources the system- atic review search will be confined to studies published in the English language only potentially resulting in publi- cation bias as well as relevant indexed studies being over- looked.

Therefore we aim to synthesise the published literature on the relationship between HDPs and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods and analysis We will include cohort case- control and cross-sectional studies in which diagnosis of an HDP was reported and neurodevelopmental disorders were the outcome of interest based on a preprepared protocol.

This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses.Ethics and dissemination This proposed systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data therefore does not require ethics approval.

Two authors will independently review the titles and abstracts of all studies perform data extraction using a standardiseddata collection form and assess study quality using a bias classification tool.

Conversely other studies have reported no associationhighlighting the need for further study in this area.

This includes studies that aimed to look at other perinatal risk factors in addi- tion to HDP.

We will include studies published in English only including all years from inception of the electronic databases until June 2017.
