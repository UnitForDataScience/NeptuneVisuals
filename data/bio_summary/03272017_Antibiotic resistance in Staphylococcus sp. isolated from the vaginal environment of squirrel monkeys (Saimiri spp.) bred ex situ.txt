Ten years ago Lilenbaum et al.10 also observed a low resistance 16 to genta- micin in isolates obtained from vaginal swabs of lion tamarins demon- strating a certain stability in the resistance rates of microorganisms from such animals to the drug over the years.

That finding was really surprising as in the present study conducted with vaginal sam- ple of Saimiri spp penicillin G showed great results with only 6.6 of resistance in the analyzed samples.Methicillin resistance was observed in 13.1 1291 of CoNS and 25 14 of CoPS in this study.

Induced resistance to clindamycin was evaluated by placing erythromycin and clindamycin disks at a dis- tance of 15-26 mm.After incubation the diameters of the growth inhibition halos were measured for interpreting the results.

Cefoxitin disks were used to determine methicillin resistance of coagulase-negative staphylococci CoNS.17 The bacterial isolates were identified as induced resistant to clindamycin when a halo formation occurred in the shape of the letter D.2.5  Statistical analysisA descriptive statistical analysis was used to calculate the relative and absolute occurrence frequency of Staphylococcus sp in the vaginal en- vironment of squirrel monkeys.3  RESULTSThe growth of Staphylococcus sp was observed in 54.2 95175 of vaginal swab samples.

Half of the CoPS 24 showed resis- tance to at least one antibiotic whereas 47.2 4391 of CoNS showed resistance.

CoNS showed the least resistance to tetracy- cline 28.5 2691 followed by chloramphenicol 15.4 1491 and methicillin 13.2 1291.

The frequency of antimicrobial resistance is shown in Figure 1.ish to yellowish color and continuous edge up to 1-2 mm in diam- eter Gram stain and some biochemical tests such as catalase activity glucose fermentation and oxidation test susceptibility to bacitracin 0.04 UI and production of free coagulase.152.4  Disk diffusion testThe susceptibility of the samples to a panel of nine most commonly used antimicrobial agents in the medical practice of non-human pri- mates was tested by the disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute of animal16 and human samples.17 Disks of cefoxitin 30 mg clindamycin 2 mg chloram- phenicol 30 mg enrofloxacin 5 mg erythromycin 15 mg gen-302520151050Coagulase-negative StaphylococcusCoagulase-positive Staphylococcustamicin 10 mg penicillin G 10 UI trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 23 and 75 mg and tetracycline 30 mg were tested.

However this finding contrasts that reported in companion animals such as dogs and cats that are subjected to greater selective pressure by the indiscriminate usage of antibiotics and that present a large increase in resistance rates in recent years.19-21Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates had a greater resis- tance to tetracycline 28.5 and chloramphenicol 15.4.

Lilenbaum et al.10 also observed a high resistance to tetracycline but not to chlor- amphenicol which in our study also showed resistance.Aspis and coworkers22 evaluating Staphylococcus sp.
