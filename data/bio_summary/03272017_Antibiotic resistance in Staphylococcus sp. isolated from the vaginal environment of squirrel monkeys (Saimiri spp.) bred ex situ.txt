are neotropical primates belonging to the subfamily saimierinae that comprises the following species saimiri cassiquiarensis saimiri vanzolinii saimiri macrodon saimiri boliviensis saimiri sciureus saimiri ustus and saimiri oerstedii.1 these species have been widely used as animal models in various research areas.23 squirrel monkeys may be prone to some bacterial diseases because of their ex situ breeding system or the type of breeding management used.4 staphylococcus sp are normally present in the vaginal microbiota of non-human primates such as chimpanzees pan troglodytes5 baboons papio anubis6 howler monkeys alouatta caraya7 rhesus monkeys macaca mulatta8 pig-tailed monkeys macaca nemestrina9 golden lion tamarins leontopithecus rosalia golden-headed lion tamarinsleontopithecus chrysomelas and black lion tamarins leontopithecus chrysopygus.10 however the occurrence of staphylococcus sp in the vaginal microbiota of squirrel monkeys remains to be described in the literature.in some studies the isolation of staphylococcus in rhesus monkeys has been associated with cases of pyometra11 vaginal infections12 and an ascending infection of the uterus.13 in addition uterine infec- tions may lead to infertility and vaginitis that even if transient hinders copulation reducing the colony fertility.

there are currently no reports regarding the involve- ment of staphylococcus sp in reproductive disorders or their normal occurrence in the vaginal microbiota of squirrel monkeys.in the present study staphylococcal strains were identified in the vaginal microflora of squirrel monkeys and were isolated in 54.2 of vaginal swabs thus characterizing a carrier state.

cons showed the least resistance to tetracy- cline 28.5 2691 followed by chloramphenicol 15.4 1491 and methicillin 13.2 1291. the most active antimicrobial agent was gentamicin no strains resistant followed by erythromycin 1 191 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 2.1 291 clindamycin 2.1 291 and penicillin 6.6 691. cops were resistant to tetracycline in 25 14 erythromycin 25 14 and methicillin 25 14. the frequency of antimicrobial resistance is shown in figure 1.ish to yellowish color and continuous edge up to 1-2 mm in diam- eter gram stain and some biochemical tests such as catalase activity glucose fermentation and oxidation test susceptibility to bacitracin 0.04 ui and production of free coagulase.152.4  disk diffusion testthe susceptibility of the samples to a panel of nine most commonly used antimicrobial agents in the medical practice of non-human pri- mates was tested by the disk diffusion method according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute of animal16 and human samples.17 disks of cefoxitin 30 mg clindamycin 2 mg chloram- phenicol 30 mg enrofloxacin 5 mg erythromycin 15 mg gen-302520151050coagulase-negative staphylococcuscoagulase-positive staphylococcustamicin 10 mg penicillin g 10 ui trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 23 and 75 mg and tetracycline 30 mg were tested.

ten years ago lilenbaum et al.10 also observed a low resistance 16 to genta- micin in isolates obtained from vaginal swabs of lion tamarins demon- strating a certain stability in the resistance rates of microorganisms from such animals to the drug over the years.

however this finding contrasts that reported in companion animals such as dogs and cats that are subjected to greater selective pressure by the indiscriminate usage of antibiotics and that present a large increase in resistance rates in recent years.19-21coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates had a greater resis- tance to tetracycline 28.5 and chloramphenicol 15.4. lilenbaum et al.10 also observed a high resistance to tetracycline but not to chlor- amphenicol which in our study also showed resistance.aspis and coworkers22 evaluating staphylococcus sp.

that finding was really surprising as in the present study conducted with vaginal sam- ple of saimiri spp penicillin g showed great results with only 6.6 of resistance in the analyzed samples.methicillin resistance was observed in 13.1 1291 of cons and 25 14 of cops in this study.

thus this study aimed to investigate the res- ident vaginal bacterial microbiota of squirrel monkeys particularly staphylococcus sp and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates.j med primatol.

furthermore other studies demonstrated that the vaginal microbi- ota of non-human primates was similar to that of humans where a predominance of coagulase-negative strains were detected.67 in this study the two cops found in the vaginal environment of squirrel mon- keys were from animals housed in the same cage this is an important finding because cops are often related to acute purulent infectious processes both in humans and non-human primates as highlighted by lilenbaum et al.10 these bacteria have been also described in clin- ical cases of metritis and vaginitis in rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys macaca fascicularis.8gentamicin was the most effective antimicrobial agent in this study as all isolates of staphylococcus sp were sensitive to it.

similarly drougka et al.23 isolated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from a sample taken from a skin infection site of a squirrel monkey s. sciureus from a zoo in greece and suggested that the microorganism could have been trans- mitted to the animals by humans.

in other studies with non-humanprimates strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus were also iso- lated24-26 agreeing with the findings of squirrel monkeys in our study.

the recovery of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus sp from vaginal samples of squirrel monkeys was not previously reported.
