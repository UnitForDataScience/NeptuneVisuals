For M. cavernosa the orange and brown color morphs occur side by side in the same environment which creates a natural comparative experiment to investigate multiple aspects of the biology of host and microbiome in this species of coral.In this study we assess the community composition of the microbiome for both color morphs of Montastraea cavernosa using gene-targeted amplicon sequencing and potential physiological differences in the host and microbiome using RNASeq based transcriptomics.

The minimal changes in transcription observed in many studies of dinoflagellates suggest that either much of the gene regulation occurs post-transcriptionally or that specific targeting of the spliced-leader sequences may be necessary to increase the recovery of many transcripts.The differential expression of prokaryotic genes in the metatranscriptome provided no additional conclusive physiological differences between the brown and orange morphs of Montastraea cavernosa except in the form of another cyanobacterial marker psbD D2 protein of photosystem II in cyanobacteria which adds support to the reported differential expression of targeted genes described above and other data presented here such as the number of cyanobacterial reads and flow cytometry data.The analysis above provides an important examination of the genetic metagenetic and transcriptomic under- pinnings for the differences in the co-occurring color morphs of the coral Montastraea cavernosa.

Cyanobacteria were well-represented taxonomically in coral samples with 62 OTUs but it represented only 0.57 to 3.97 of total reads recovered and there was no significant difference in the commu- nity structure of Cyanobacteria between orange and brown morphs of M. cavernosa PERMANOVA t  0.99 P perm  0.497 after a Bonferroni correction to avoid a Type 1 error using a P  0.025 significance cutoff.

Global differential expression analysis on normalized count data using the edgeR pipeline red dots are significantly different between brown and orange morphs of Montastraea cavernosa while blue dots are not significant for the host Symbiodinium spp and microbiome.Differential Expression Analyses.

Also our analysis using AFLPOP correctly assigned orange samples to the orange population 87.5 of the time whereas brown samples were correctly categorized 50.5 of the time.AMOVA was then used to compare the relative levels of genetic differentiation between brown and orange colonies at LSI relative to those between brown colonies from the different locations surveyed in Brazeau et al.. Brown samples from LSI Little Cayman and San Salvador had an average PhST of 0.091 P  0 with PhST values for individual locations varying from 0.0809 to 0.1165 Table S5.

Bacteria Archaea and viruses of all these components an endolithic community and several recently described Alveolata that all likely have multiple and potentially interactive roles in the biology of corals-.In the Caribbean the great star coral Montastraea cavernosa Linnaeus is abundant on Caribbean and Eastern Atlantic coral reefs and has an extremely wide depth range from shallow through mesophotic depths 3-100 m. It is commonly found in three color morphs cyan orange and brownand based on multiple lines of molecular and biophysical evidence the orange morphs contain significant populations of symbiotic cyanobacteria express- ing phycoerythrin in their microbiome-.

Rarefaction curves of observed OTUs approached an asymptote for all coral samples which were rarefied at a common depth of 2200 reads for statistical analysis.Seawater samples were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria Cyanobacteria Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria while communities in coral samples were more diverse than seawater samples and exhibited more variability between replicate samples of the same color morph especially the brown morph Fig.

Specifically we tested for differential expression in each tran- script set from M. cavernosa those putatively belonging to the coral host Symbiodinium spp.

Corals were then airbrushed 80 psi 1 cm distance to coral to remove coral soft tissues using a small volume 1-2 ml of filtered seawater.
