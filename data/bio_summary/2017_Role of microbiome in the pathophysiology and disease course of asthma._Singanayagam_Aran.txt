However these studies focus primarily on atopic asthma and do not inform whether the effects observed in germ-free mice are due to an absence of microbiota in the lungs or in the intestine as the absence of microbes induced is not tissue- specific.Evidence that the intestinal microbiome contributes to development of asthmaHuman intestinal microbiota studiesIn contrast to the relative paucity of longitudinal data on the lung microbiota the longer duration that 16S rRNA technology has been available for sequencing intestinal bacterial communities has allowed sufficient time for cohort studies to be carried out examining early gut microbiota composition and association with development of asthma.

Longitudinal studies to evaluate changes in the lung microbiota during disease progression are now required to more comprehensively investigate the role of the microbiota in asthma.Neonatal culture-based studiesTo date there are no existing cohort studies that have carried out a detailed longitudinal evaluation of how the lower respiratory microbiota develops from birth through infancy and related this to how specific changes in community composition andor diversity might correlate with subsequent development of asthma.

There is also considerable interest in the gut-lung axis and future studies should be targeted at understanding the complex interactions that occur between the bacterial communities in these distinct anatomical locations.SUMMARY POINTSHuman studies have revealed associations between the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the respiratory tract or alterations of the gut microbiota in early life and subsequent risk of asthma.Emerging evidence suggests that the lung microbiota is dysregulated in asthma with specific changes in community composition according to severity and phenotype.Studies using germ-free mice have demonstrated a mechanistic link between the neonatal microbiota and development of allergic airway inflammation.-Bacterial communities within the lung andor intestine play an important role in shaping early immunological development and may contribute to development and progression of asthma-Future work should be targeted towards longitudinal sampling to examine the effect of external and internal factors including therapies on the intestinal and lung microbiome and associations with disease outcomes.ReferencesSkloot GS Asthma phenotypes and endotypes a personalized approach to treatment.Curr Opin Pulm Med 2016 223-9.Lotvall J Akdis CA Bacharier LB Bjermer L Casale TB Custovic A Lemanske RF Jr. Wardlaw AJ Wenzel SE Greenberger PA Asthma endotypes a new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome.

Table 1 summarises the findings of published studies that have evaluated the lung microbiota according to severity andor phenotype in asthma.Combined these studies provide evidence for contribution of the lower airways microbiota to asthma pathophysiology by demonstrating that specific bacterial taxa are associated with disease severity response to therapy and host immune responses.

Further evidence from animal models that the lung microbiota may play a causal role in asthma inception is provided in a study by Nembrini et al in which intranasal exposure to E coli showed protection against ovalbumin- induced Th2 responses and allergic airway inflammation31.Combined these studies provide convincing evidence that the microbiota may play a causal role in the development of asthma.

These findings were supported in a study by Trompette et al in which high-fibre diet in mice led to an increased relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae and suppressed allergic airway inflammation following house dust mite exposure41.Potential role of probiotics in asthma prevention andor treatmentThe studies described above demonstrate that the gut microbiota may be an important determinant of asthma development and raise speculation that interventions such as oral administration of live microorganisms in the form of probiotics to beneficially modulate the intestinal microbiota might represent a promising strategy for prevention andor treatment of asthma.

These studies suggest that the microbiota is highly likely to change as asthma develops and progresses and a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence this.Conclusions and Future directionsThe emergence of next generation molecular sequencing techniques to characterize the microbiota has facilitated renewed interest in the role of microbes in pathogenesis and progression of asthma.

In this review we evaluate the evidence that the respiratory tract and intestinal microbiota contribute to asthma pathogenesis and progression.Recent findings Human studies have revealed associations between the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the respiratory tract in early life and subsequent risk of allergic sensitization and asthma.

Similarly alterations in the intestinal microbiota of neonates have also been shown to precede the development of asthma.
