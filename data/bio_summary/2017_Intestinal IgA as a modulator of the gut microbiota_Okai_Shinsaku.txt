Here we discuss the physiologic significance of recognition of a specific epitope of a bacterial metabolic enzyme by W27 as well as the importance of the properties of intestinal IgA in maintaining gut homeostasis.A high-affinity and poly-reactive W27 IgA targets a bacterial metabolic enzyme and affects bacterial cell growthIntestinal IgA is important for control of commensal microbiota in the gutbut it remains unknown how IgA recognizes and shapes this microbial community.

However the signal that stimulates this biased IgA selection in vivo remains to be determined.IgA deficiency and low-affinity IgA cause a variety of gut pathological phenotypes in miceAs we reported previously both activation-induced cytidine deaminase AID mutant mice AID- mice lacking all IgA and AIDG23S mutant mice lacking high-affinity IgAs suffer from lymphoproliferative disorders such as germinal center GC hyperplasia in the small intestine.

However we assume that the majority of intestinal IgA suppresses bound bacteria rather than aiding their growth at least in mice because more than 90 of independent IgA clones that we isolated from small intestine could recognize the EEHI sequence and sup- press bacteria harboring it .We propose that high-affinity and poly-reactive intestinal IgA such as W27 shapes the gut microbiota to maintain its diversity by suppressing not killing fast-growing bacterial species such as Proteobacteria that harbor the EEHI sequence in SHMT.

To determine whether IgA generated by AIDG23S mice had lower affinity for E. coli which has the EEHI sequence in SHMT we extracted polyclonal IgA from the gut contents of wild-type and AIDG23S mice and compared the binding abilities for E. coli by ELISA.

Our recent observations supported others' findings that intestinal IgA selectively binds harmful bacteria to eliminate them from the gut microbiota.On the other hand several reports demonstrated that IgA binding could facilitate gut colonization by bound bacteria rather than suppressing their growth.

One promising agent capable of shaping the gut microbiota community is intestinal IgA.

Recently we isolated a high-affinity poly-reactive IgA clone W27 from mouse intestinal lamina propria cells and identified it as a useful gut com- mensal modulator.

In standard mouse models of colitis and IgA disorders oral treatment of W27 prevented pathological colon phenotypes by improv- ing the composition of gut microbiota.

We selected the IgA clone W27 because it exhib- ited the strongest ability to bind multiple commensal bacteria while binding weakly or not at all to beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium bifidum.
