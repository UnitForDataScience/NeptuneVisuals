Some of the bacterial groups fell below detection level resulting in further decline of the bacterial diversity from 48 to 36.However these tendencies were temporary.The total bacterial concentrations in MS patients started to increase at week 12 reaching values typical for healthy controls at week 2324 being then significantly higher than bacterial concentrations in MS patients prior to diet and statistically not different to mean bacterial concentrations in healthy controls P  0.7.

It presumably results from the general downregulation of the colonic biofermentative function and affects mainly biofermentative active groups leaving bacterial groups with other specific tasks untouched.We observed no changes in the microbiome that could be specific for MS.While mean concentrations of all essential bacteria detected with EREC mainly Roseburia Bac303 Bacteroides Fprau F. prausnitzii probes were consistently reduced in MS the shifts in individual substantial bacterial groups were multidirectional with concentrations of some bacterial groups unchanged increased or reduced when compared to healthy controls.

The FITC marked universal probe was used in each hybridization to evaluate the number of all bacteria C5 marked probes with a different specificity to C3 probes were used to determine the spatial relation of different bacterial groups to eachother.Only signals that hybridized with a specific FISH probe and the universal FISH probe but did not hybridize with specific FISH probes from unrelated bacterial groups were enumerated Swidsinski 2006.FISH ProbesOne hundred sixty-two bacterial FISH probes available from public resources were applied for the comparative analysis of the colonic microbiome in healthy controls and MS patients Tables 1AB.

Changes in concentrations of 35 numerically substantial bacterial groups were monitored at baseline and at 2 12 and 2324 weeks.Results No MS typical microbiome pattern was apparent.The total concentrations and diversity of substantial bacterial groups were reduced in MS patients P  0.001.

81141. doi Background Colonic microbiome is thought to be involved in auto-immune multiple sclerosis MS. Interactions between diet and the colonic microbiome in MS are unknown.Methods We compared the composition of the colonic microbiota quantitatively in 25 MS patients and 14 healthy controls.Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH with 162 ribosomal RNA derived bacterial FISH probes was used.

None of the investigated bacterial groups including groups with unspecific signals demonstrated prevalence or absence in MS patients which could be interpreted in terms of Koch's postulates.As long as bacterial groups were compared pairwise the differences between MS and healthy patients were discordant gradual and moderate reaching only in 9 groups statistical significance Table 2.

Seven substantial individual bacterial groups had similar high concentrations in MS and healthy controls.Due to uncertain occurrence and low concentrations which was difficult to quantify we did not compare the single marginal bacterial groups in MS patients and controls quantitatively.

In contrast the pioneer bacterial groups remained reduced over the whole duration of the ketogenic diet p  0.05-0.008 indicating an absence of substantial microbiome reshaping.Although the concentrations and the biodiversity of colonic microbiota are strong markers of the intensity of the microbial metabolism the shifts in bacterial groups per se do not reveal the exact metabolic changes taking place.

The concentrations of pioneer bacterial groups fell and remained low the concentrations of Akkermansia increased initially but then declined during the ketogenic diet.DISCUSSIONPrevious investigation using high throughput DNA sequencing technologies in large scale 16S rRNA or shotgun metagenomic sequencing demonstrated miscellaneous changes in the composition of the colonic microbiome which correlated with MS MS-onset -therapy or -relapse Kim et al.
