Here we review the background of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA regulation of FMT as well as FMT donor selection and laboratory screening recommendations.STOOL BANKS AND FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REGULATION OF FECAL TRANSPLANTATIONIn May 2013 the FDA announced that FMT would be regulated as an investigational new drug IND due to its use for the treatment of disease and the absence of large randomized control studies supporting its efficacy and safety  .

In reports from OpenBiome published results of donor screening in a trial of FMT for IBD and another trial of FMT for RCDI 3 10 and 32 of potential donors respectively ultimately met criteria for donation    .

However a recent study of detection of C. difficile in asymptomatic patients suggestedTABLE 3 Recommended stool testing for potential fecal donorsaaJSCR Joint Society Consensus Recommendations to the FDA for fecal donor selection and screening -- recommendation not noted in article  recommended or routinely performed test OE options equally reasonable  test should be considered on a case-by-case basis as suggested by exposure status of donor and immune status of recipient  H. pylori antigen testing recommended for upper routes of FMT.bEIA enzyme immunoassay GDH glutamate dehydrogenase MRSA methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus vancomycin-resistant enterococci.cJSCR Joint Society Consensus Recommendations to the FDA for fecal donor selection and screening.a very similar negative predictive value of GDH compared to a commercial nucleic acid amplification test NAAT 99.3 versus 99.9 respectively .

However given the reported exclusion of donors based on viral testing of stool donor fecal samples further study in this area may serve to expedite the preparation of fecal material for FMT  .

An FMT national registry has recently been spearheaded by the AGA to assess the short- term and long-term up to 10 years of patient-reported follow up safety of FMT with secondary objectives of evaluating the efficacy of FMT practice in the United States C.

However regulation of this process is in transition and there is variation in donor screening practices which can present challenges to microbiology laboratories.Prior to the ability to culture for C. difficile fecal microbiota transplantation FMT was occasionally used in humans to treat enterocolitis that was presumed to be due to Staphylococcus species .

The FDA noted that manufacturing of FMT product by a stool bank defined as an establishment that collects prepares and stores FMT product for distribution to other establishments health care providers or other entities for use in patient therapy or clinical research presents specific safety concerns by using a limited number of donors of stool administered for multiple recipients .
