Sayin et al.50 showed that the distal gut was predominantly colo- nized by secondary bile acids and deconjugated bile acids in conventionally raised mice whereas in germ-free mice the bile acid pool chiefly contained primary conjugated bile acids and almost no secondary bile acids.

This finding shows that increased plasma bile acids might not contribute to the rapid metabolic improvements observed shortly after weight-loss surgery49.Taken together the contribution of the increased pool of cir- culating bile acids and related signaling pathways to the meta- bolic effects of bariatric surgery remains to be fully elucidated.CROSS-TALK BETWEEN GUT MICROBIOTA AND BILE ACIDS AND ITS ROLE IN BARIATRIC SURGERYThe formation of bile acids in the liver is a complex process.

When they reach the gut primary bile acidsare transformed into the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid in humans and x-muricholic acids in rodents35.In addition to inducing inflammation gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating bile acids including their biosynthe- sis and biotransformation Figure 2.

Furthermore it is known that bacteria also play an important role in the synthesis and metabolism of bile acids and one study has shown that bile acids are an important con- tributor to glucose improvement20.

Thus the question arises whether the gut microbiota bile acids or their interactions play a role in the beneficial effects induced by bariatric surgery on host energy metabolism.The present review aims to summarize the present knowl- edge of the impacts of bariatric surgery on the host intestinal microbiota bile acids and the cross-talk between them and to discuss further potential contributions to the metabolic effects of weight-loss surgery on obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.ROLE OF GUT MICROBIOTA IN BARIATRIC SURGERYNumerous micro-organisms exist on the surface of the skin and mucosal linings in the human body.

Primary bile acids are modified by intestinal microbiota including transformation into secondary bile acids in the colon.

Based on these data it is difficult to conclude whether bile acids contribute to the effects of RYGB but it is clear that bile diversion could be sufficient to result in weight loss and improved glucose and lipid metabolism independent of surgical rearrangement of the digestive tract.In addition to roles in intestinal fat ingestion accumulating evidence suggests that bile acids exert important effects as hor- mones by activating receptors that include a G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 and the farnesoid X receptor FXR ligand- activated transcription factor40.

Thus it appears that bile acids and FGF19 did not work for the beneficial effects on glucose metabolism after bariatric surgery in that study.Furthermore another prospective study that examined serum bile acid levels before and after surgery in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery showed that circulating bile acids were decreased at 1 week post surgery mildly increased at 3 months after surgery and significantly increased at 1 year post-surgery.

Furthermore after discharge into the gut primary bile acids are modified by intestinal microbiota including deconjugation and further transformation into sec- ondary bile acids such as CA to deoxycholic acid or chen- odeoxycholic acid to lithocholic acid which results in an increased chemical diversity of the bile acid pool40.
