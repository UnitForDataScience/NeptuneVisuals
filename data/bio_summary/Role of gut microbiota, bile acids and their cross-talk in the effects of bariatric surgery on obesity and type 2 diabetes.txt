this finding shows that increased plasma bile acids might not contribute to the rapid metabolic improvements observed shortly after weight-loss surgery49.taken together the contribution of the increased pool of cir- culating bile acids and related signaling pathways to the meta- bolic effects of bariatric surgery remains to be fully elucidated.cross-talk between gut microbiota and bile acids and its role in bariatric surgerythe formation of bile acids in the liver is a complex process.

sayin et al.50 showed that the distal gut was predominantly colo- nized by secondary bile acids and deconjugated bile acids in conventionally raised mice whereas in germ-free mice the bile acid pool chiefly contained primary conjugated bile acids and almost no secondary bile acids.

when they reach the gut primary bile acidsare transformed into the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid in humans and x-muricholic acids in rodents35.in addition to inducing inflammation gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating bile acids including their biosynthe- sis and biotransformation figure 2. bile acid biosynthesis consists of several enzymatic catalysis reactions.

thus the question arises whether the gut microbiota bile acids or their interactions play a role in the beneficial effects induced by bariatric surgery on host energy metabolism.the present review aims to summarize the present knowl- edge of the impacts of bariatric surgery on the host intestinal microbiota bile acids and the cross-talk between them and to discuss further potential contributions to the metabolic effects of weight-loss surgery on obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.role of gut microbiota in bariatric surgerynumerous micro-organisms exist on the surface of the skin and mucosal linings in the human body.

these findings raise the possibility that vsg induces metabolic effects through bile acids fxr signaling and gut microbiota20.figure 2  the relationship between the effects of bariatric surgery on the composition of bile acids and the gut microbiota.

based on these data it is difficult to conclude that gut bacteria are essential for the effects of rygb but we can conclude that changes in gut microbiota induced by rygb are sufficient to produce weight loss.role of bile acids in bariatric surgerybile acids are a host of steroid molecules that can be synthe- sized from cholesterol in the liver conjugated to taurine or gly- cine to enhance water solubility secreted into the bile and discharged into the duodenum after a meal where they act as surfactants to facilitate lipid ingestion35.

furthermore after discharge into the gut primary bile acids are modified by intestinal microbiota including deconjugation and further transformation into sec- ondary bile acids such as ca to deoxycholic acid or chen- odeoxycholic acid to lithocholic acid which results in an increased chemical diversity of the bile acid pool40.

these find- ings suggest that bile acids can remodel the pattern of intestinal microbes similar to that induced after bariatric surgery.these data show that weight-loss surgery can affect the inter- play between bile acids and gut microbiota which can con- tribute to the metabolic effects observed after metabolic surgery.conclusionsthe potent metabolic effects of bariatric surgery raise the possi- bility that patients with type 2 diabetes could be cured the operation not only improves obesity glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity but also opens a new avenue to gain insights into the etiology of metabolic disorders.

however remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been observed after gastric bypass before the occurrence of significant weight reduction showing that the glucose improvement resulting from metabolic operations occurs not only because of weight loss but also due to weight- independent factors such as gut hormones bile acids gut microbiota nervous system and other potential underlying mechanisms15-18.

conversely bile acids can directly inhibit bacterial growth as a detergent and thereby indirectly regulate the composition of gut microbes through signaling pathways such as hormone-mediated signaling figure 253. this was supported by a study that showed that oral administration of ca altered the composition of gut microbiota in rats54.

furthermore it is known that bacteria also play an important role in the synthesis and metabolism of bile acids and one study has shown that bile acids are an important con- tributor to glucose improvement20.

primary bile acids are modified by intestinal microbiota including transformation into secondary bile acids in the colon.

based on these data it is difficult to conclude whether bile acids contribute to the effects of rygb but it is clear that bile diversion could be sufficient to result in weight loss and improved glucose and lipid metabolism independent of surgical rearrangement of the digestive tract.in addition to roles in intestinal fat ingestion accumulating evidence suggests that bile acids exert important effects as hor- mones by activating receptors that include a g protein-coupled receptor tgr5 and the farnesoid x receptor fxr ligand- activated transcription factor40.

in the ileum the activation of fxr by bile acids facilitates the secretion of fibroblast growth factor 19 fgf19 known as fgf15 in mice which circulates to the liver in portal blood and reduces the expression of 7a- hydroxylase to inhibit hepatic bile acid synthesis figure 143. thus we can hypothesize that bile acids exert beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism after bariatric surgery by changing signaling pathways through related receptors.
