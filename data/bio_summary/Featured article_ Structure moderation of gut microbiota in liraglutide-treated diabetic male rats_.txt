To sum up our findings propose that the prevention of diabetes by liraglutide in the diabetic male rats may be associated with the structural change of the gut microbiota inflammation alleviation and abundantly elevated SCFA-producing bacteria in the intestine.Keywords Diabetes gut microbiota glucagon-like peptide 1 short chain fatty acid probiotic bacteriaExperimental Biology and Medicine 2018 243 34-44.

In another study there was a reduction in the abundance of Ruminococcaceae in a bitter melon formulation-treated male rats could reduce FBG com- pared to the diabetic rats.40In conclusion our findings suggest that significant changes in gut microbiota are associated with liraglutide treatment on the diabetic male rats including enrichment of SCFA producers and probiotic bacteria.

QIIME allows analysis of high-throughput community sequencing data.

Therefore we used 454 pyrosequencing to test the change of gut microbiota from liraglutide treatment.Materials and methodsAnimalsFive-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats 174.7 - 15.3 g were bought from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China Permit No.

Effects of liraglutide on alpha diversity analysis of gut microbiota in diabetic male rats.

found lower alpha diversity within the phylum Bacteroidetes in both the colon and feces of high-fat-diet-fed mice.16 Second by using unweighted UniFrac PCA analysis we confirmed that the gut microbiota of the normal diabetic and liraglutide-treated male rats were structurally separated from each other in the two principal components.Furthermore our result presented that compared with the normal rats diabetic rats had increased Firmicutes-to- Bacteroidetes ratio in the fecal microbiota.

Pyrosequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA genes manifested a remarkable transfer of gut microbiota construction in liraglutide-treated male rats compared with that of the diabetic male rats.
