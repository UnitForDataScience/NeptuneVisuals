The test was carried out over 3 successive days for each 4 groups from 34 to 36 days of age.During the week prior to the test quail learnt to eat mealworms for 4 days.

The measures made during the test were the duration to complete the test the succession of cups visited and the number of errors done.

Quail with the higher numbers of induction or duration were considered to be the most fearful.Open-field testAn open-field test was also performed to test emotional reactivity in Japanese quail .

To complete the test animals had to collect 8 mealworms in 8 cups.The 8 cups were placed in the arena used for the open-field test .

For the last three days of the week animals were placed four by four in the box test with one worm in each of the 8 cups in order to limit bias due to a new location.The feed pellets in the home cages were removed at least 3 h before the test for the quail to be hungry.

Similarly vagotomy abolished the anxiolytic effect of a chronic consumption of a strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus in the elevated plus maze test and open-field test in BALBc mice .These results raise the question of the importance of host genotypeand its sensitivity to changes in the gut microbiota postulated to occur through P. acidilactici supplementation .

They showed that a strain of Bifidobacterium breve led to lower anxiety in the elevated plus maze test but had no effect in the open field test whereas the results were the other way round when they used a strain of B. longum.

Therefore it is important to note that the animal model the genetic line the bacterial strain and the behavioural test can conduct todifferent effects of probiotic on emotional measures.Influence of the probiotic on memoryIn the memory test the global rates of errors were not different between the three days.

This observation suggested that the test would enable to test short-term memory which is independent between days.

The quail that never managed to eat mealworms were eliminated for that test.
