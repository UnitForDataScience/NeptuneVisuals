2009. however the relative roles of lps and palmitate in hfd-induced enteric nitrergic neuronal loss have not yet been defined.to address this question we used a western diet wd containing less fat than routinely used in a hfd 35 kcal from fat for wd vs. 60 kcal from fat for hfd that has been designed to represent the typical western dietary practices in all aspects including caloric value and macro- and micronutrient composition hintze et al.

therefore the present study aimed to i evaluate the impact of wd consumption on myenteric nitrergic neurons andmotility ii characterize the importance of gut micro- biota dysbiosis tlr4 signalling and plasma lps and ffa levels in the development of wd-induced neuropathy and iii evaluate the synergic effects of lps and palmitate in vitro on enteric nos neuronal cell survival.methodsethical approvalall animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc of emory and georgia state universities.

animals were killed by co2 inhalation in accordance with iacuc guidelines.animalssix-week-old male c57bl6 mice were obtained from jackson laboratories bar harbor me usa and placed after acclimation on wd 34.5 calories from fat td.140304 harlan laboratories madison wi usa or regular diet rd 16.9 calories from fat td.140305 for 3 6 9 and 12 weeks.

age-matched tlr4-- mice on a bl10 background also purchased from jackson laboratories were fed rd or wd for 12 weeks.

the wd was designed as described by hintze et al.

2012 rd is the control of wd.

diet compositions provided by the manufacturer table 1 suggest that the relative palmitate content in wd and rd is 41. mice were monitored for body weight bw and stool indices throughout the experiments.

blood glucose was measured in 6 h fasted rd and wd mice fed for 12 weeks with a performa accu-check glucose meter roche basel switzerland.

for clarity only rd and wd animals fed for similar durations were compared together.

p  0.05 was considered statistically significant  p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001.resultswd increased body-weight and plasma ffa but had no effect on lps and glucose levelsour first step was to characterize whether wd con- sumption results in obesity and diabetes analogous to that previously observed in response to hfd 60 kcal from fat.

therefore we monitored bw gain and blood glucose in rd and wd mice fed for 3 6 9 and 12 weeks.

compared to rd wd mice gained 21 and 42 respectively after 6 and 12 weeks fig.

to investigate whether adipose tissue inflammation is responsible for this ffa increase we measured proinflammatory gene expression in both mesenteric and epididymal tissues from 6-week fed rd and wd mice.
