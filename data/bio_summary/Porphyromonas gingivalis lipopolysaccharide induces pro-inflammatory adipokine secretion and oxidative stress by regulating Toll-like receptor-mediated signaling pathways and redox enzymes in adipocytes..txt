Moreover both LPS dose-dependently increased the secretion of IL- 6 B and MCP-1 C. Given that P. gingivalis LPS used at 10 mgmL significantly elevated IL-6 release this concentration was selected for the following experiments in accordance with litera- ture data .Effect of LPS from P. gingivalis and E. coli on insulin-mediated lipid accumulation and the expression of genes encoding PPARg and FAS adipogenic markersTo evaluate LPS effect on insulin-mediated lipid storage 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in the presence of insulin were exposed or not to P. gingivalis or E. coli LPS.

Also LPS from both bacterial strains did not affect the expression of the gene encoding PPARg transcription factor C. Interestingly only P. gingivalis LPS induced an increase in mRNA levels of FAS D.Effect of LPS from P. gingivalis and E. coli on the secretion of adiponectin leptin resistin IL-6 and MCP-1 adipokinesOnly P. gingivalis LPS reduced the release of adiponectin recog- nized as an anti-inflammatory factor with levels inversely corre- lated with body fat mass A.

gingivalis LPS.Effect of LPS from P. gingivalis and E. coli on ROS production and the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in redox status regulationWe tested the impact of P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS on adipocyte redox markers.

Significant differences were considered for p values inferior to 0.05.Table 1Primers used for RT-qPCR analysis.ResultsDose-dependent effect of LPS from P. gingivalis and E. coli on cell viability and pro-inflammatory adipokine secretionTo assess the possible action of LPS on the viability of 3T3-L1 cells dose-dependent effects of P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS were evaluated through MTT assay.

Importantly the deleterious effect of P. gingivalis LPS on NOX2 NOX4 and catalase gene expression was significantly more pro- nounced than that mediated by E. coli LPS suggesting a differential impact of both LPS on redox homeostasis alteration in adipocytes.DiscussionThe present study compared the effect of LPS from P. gingivalis and E. coli on inflammatory adipokine secretion and redox status of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

To our best knowledge this study provides the first evidence for P. gingivalis LPS capacity to alter adipocyte production of major factors such as FAS leptin and resistin known to contribute to insulin resistance.Additionally we found that P. gingivalis LPS-treated adipocytes exhibited a raised production of IL-6 and MCP-1 pro-inflammatory adipokines.

gingivalis and E. coli LPS led to an increase in mRNA levels of NOX2 and NOX4 genes although the impact of P. gingivalis LPS was significantly more pronounced.

gingivalis LPS-treated adipocytes.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the ability of P. gingivalis LPS to pro- mote a pro-inflammatory adipokine secretory profile in adipocytes.
