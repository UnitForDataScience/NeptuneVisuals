Increased levels of ammonia due to impaired hepatic detoxification processes as well as the consequences of alcohol abuse have been proposed as modulators of HRQoL patients with chronic liver disease.2 Even minimal hepatic encepha- lopathy impairs cognitive function and HRQoL in patients with cirrhosis although fortunately lactulose which might modulate the gut microbiome improves both cognitive function and HRQoL in this setting.3 This and other studies imply a relationship of the gut microbiome with HRQoL.It has also been demonstrated that liver cirrhosis is associated with significant gut microbial dysbiosis4 possibly a consequence of liver disease.

Increasing evi- dence also suggests that the gut microbiota influences liver disease progression5 potentially influencing morbidity and mortality especially in advanced cirrho- sis.67 The relationship between gut microbiome andPROs after liver transplantation LT in humans is elucidated in the current issue of Liver Transplantation by Bajaj et al.8 who addressed if persistent cognitive impairment after LT evaluated by the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy score PHES and HRQoL are associated with gut microbiota diversity as assessed by multitagged sequencing.Most recipients experienced improvement in HRQoL and PHES.

Although the authors managed to recruit 50 of 68 recipients and assessed in 45 of those also post-LT PHES score10 and the Sickness Impact Profile11 well-validated measures to evaluate cognitive impair- ment and HRQoL in patients with cirrhosis.It seems hard to differentiate between the effects of impaired liver function and gut dysbiosis on cognitive function and HRQoL since both will often go hand- in-hand.

The patho- physiology and molecular mechanisms of how the gut microbiome and its metabolites affect the brain are being explored.13 An important question that shouldEDITORIAL873REIBERGER AND TREBICKALIVER TRANSPLANTATION July 2017be addressed in future studies is if targeting specific organisms that were implicated in persistent cognitive impairment after LT ie increased Proteobacteria is feasible and represents a potential therapy to improve cognitive function and HRQoL.This study helps in understanding changes in the gut microbiome and cognitive dysfunction and impaired HRQoL after LT14 and take us a step closer to understanding specific aspects of gut dysbiosis in patients with liver disease and potential therapeutic targets.Thomas Reiberger M.D.1 Jonel Trebicka M.D.

Therefore although LT almost normalizes the microbiome composition some dysbio- sis may still persist when LT patients are compared with healthy controls.This study overcame several challenges such as excluding bias by antibiotic treatment andor infec- tions9 as well as uncertainty of LT availability and the authors discussed very well the limitations.

In addition the impact of other cofactors such as immunosuppressive medication both on intes- tinal permeability and microbiome composition needs to be considered after LT.12 However the data pre- sented in this study suggest an important role of the gut microbiome on cognitive function in patients with reconstituted liver function after successful LT as well as improvement in the gut microbiome.

Patient-reported outcomes PROs such as health- related quality of life HRQoL fatigue and emotional and cognitive functions are increasingly recognized in patients with cirrhosis.

EDITORIALNew Liver - Fresh Microbiome Implications on Brain Function SEE ARTICLE ON PAGE 907Patients with end-stage liver disease have a diminished quality of life.1 This relates not only to physical aspects such as sarcopenia and immobility due to decompensation but also to cognitive impairment.

Furthermore gut microbiome diversity increased and was characterized by an increase in autochthonous taxa and a decrease in pathogenic taxa when compared with pre-LT microbiome analyses.However almost one-third of the recipients did not experience improvement in PHES after LT.

The microbiome of these patients was characterized by increased Proteobacteria but lower Firmicutes.
