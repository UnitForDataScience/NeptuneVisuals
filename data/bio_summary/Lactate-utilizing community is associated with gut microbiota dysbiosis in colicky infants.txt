The colicky infant showed 2-fold higher fecal lactate concentrations at 2 and 3 months 101.9 mM and 43.0 mM respectivelyFigure 2. a-c Total counts of LUB SRB LUB non-SRB and LUB non-SRBLUB SRB ratio in feces of infant crying 1 hd and infant crying 1 hd at 2 weeks 1 month 3 and 6 months.

Figure shows the metabo- lites produced by pure cultures of two propionate-producing LUB strains P-LUB V. ratti and P. avidum two butyrate-producing LUB strains B-LUB E. hallii and E. limosum and one LUB SRB strain D. piger in YCFA medium supplemented with lactose DL-lactate L-lactate or glucose as a sole carbon source.

Three LUB isolates from infant fecal samples V. ratti P. avidum and E. limosum and two strains from DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH Braunschweig Germany E. hallii - DSM 3353 and D. piger - DSM 749 were grown in triplicate in YCFA medium supplemented with 6 gl lactose 60 mM L-lactate 60 mM DL-lactate or 6 gl glucose.

The high prevalence of flatulence stomach cramps crying hours colic episodes and H2 excretion exclusively within the first 2 months of life and their correlations suggests that this is an important time window when the metabolic production of gas can play a crucial role in infant gastrointestinal symptoms.In this study 3 months old infants crying more than 1 hd had higher ratio of LUB non-SRB which comprised the predominant H2-producing Veillonella and H2-producing E. hallii to H2-utilizing LUB SRB.

Concentrations of acetate 70.2 vs. 42.1 mM propionate 18.5 vs. 0.1 mM and butyrate 9.9 vs.0.0 mM were also higher in the non-colicky infant compared to the colicky infant at 3 months.Characterization of lactate-utilizing bacteria isolated from infant feces.

It is therefore important to develop a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions of bacterial species within the LUB commu- nity and investigate the role of key players and metabolic balance on infant gut health.While dysbiosis of the adult gut microbiota has been linked to a wide range of diseases including IBD obesity and colon cancer little is known about the role of infant gut microbiota in gastrointestinal diseases.

We isolated butyrate-producing E. limosum and propionate-producing P. avidum from healthy infant feces and demonstrated the ability of E. limosum to reduce H2 in co-culture with Veillonella.

The colicky infant had a higher level of LUB non-SRB 6.7 vs. 3.9 log cfug feces and a lower level of LUB SRB at 2 weeks 5.5 vs. 8.4 log cfug feces compared to the non-colicky twin in the pair see Supplementary Fig.

Isolated strains of E. limosum P. avidum and V. ratti together with two other LUB E. hallii DSM 3353 and D. piger DSM 749 were characterized by their ability to use different substrates including lactose DL-lactate L-lactate and glucose to produce SCFA.
