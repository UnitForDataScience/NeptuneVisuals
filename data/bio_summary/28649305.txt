Relative abundances of bacterial phyla associated with control samples of baby spinach and mixed-ingredient salad are shown in .Pseudomonadales was the dominant order on day 0 and day 7 both for samples with plain baby spinach and mixed-ingredient salad and regardless of storage temperature.

These strains were inoculated into samples at an initial level of 50-100 CFU g-1 with separate samples used for each inoculated strain.Sample collection and processingAt the start of the experiment day 0 and after seven days of incubation at 8 and 15degC the contents of indi- vidual bags of baby spinach or mixed-ingredient salad were homogenized as described in Soderqvist et al.

So far few studies investigating microbiota in leafy vegetables have had a focus on the final product to be consumed such as RTE leafy vege- tables subject to refrigerated storage.The objective of the present study was to compare the bacterial communities before and after seven days storage of RTE baby spinach and mixed-ingredient salad baby spinach mixed with chicken meat at refrigerator temperature 8degC in Sweden or tempera- ture abuse conditions 15degC.

Each sequence was checked by sequence scanner version 1.0 software and the identity of each strain was confirmed by blastn  .Changes in microbiota during storageTo explore changes in microbiota during storage the average proportion and associated standard error for each bacterial order was calculated for non-inocu- lated baby spinach and mixed-ingredient salad on day 0 and after storage for seven days at 8 or 15degC.

For some bacterial orders there were differences in their con- tribution to the community between samples of plain baby spinach and mixed-ingredient salad .

Relative abundance of bacterial orders in control samples of baby spinach and mixed-ingredient salad before and after storage at 8 and 15degC.

The power of pre- diction Q2cum was high for all models 0.82 0.55 and0.61 for L. monocytogenes pathogenic Y. enterocolitica and E. coli O157H7 gfp respectively.The type of inoculated strain or absence thereof in the controls did not appear to affect the composi- tion of the bacterial orders in the microbiota accord- ing to Kruskal-Wallis test p  0.58.Comparing sequences and culture counts of inoculated strains with OTUsThe mixed-ingredient salads stored at 15degC for seven days featured the highest absolute viable counts of inoculated strains with L. monocytogenes concentra- tions of approximately 109 CFU g-1 and this was paralleled by abundance distribution patterns for one highly correlated OTU.

Other aims were to explore associations between microbiota and the food- borne pathogens L. monocytogenes Y. enterocolitica and pathogen model organism E. coli O157H7 gfp when experimentally inoculated into the salads before storage and to investigate if these inoculants could be detected in the 16S rRNA amplicon dataset.Materials and methodsStudy design of growth trials from which salad materials originatedSamples for amplicon sequencing were collected at dif- ferent time points during inoculum trials as described in detail in Soderqvist et al.

In samples with mixed-ingredient salad commercial grilled diced chicken meat was added to the baby spinach.
