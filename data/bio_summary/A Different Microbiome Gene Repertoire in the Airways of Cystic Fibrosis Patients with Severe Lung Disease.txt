cf patients' lungs  untargeted metagenomic approaches may provide deep insights into the microbial cf lung metagenome permitting the identification of gene sets involved in functional pathways associated with a worsening clinical condition .in the present study we performed a deep metagenomic investigation to probe the lung microbiome of twelve cf patients with mild forced expiratory volume in one second fev1  70 and severe fev1  40 lung disease.

overall the microbiome of severely affected adults with cf seems to encode different mechanisms for the facilitation of microbial colonization and persistence in the lung consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in patients with severe lung disease.keywords cystic fibrosis lung disease lung microbiome shotgun metagenomics bioinformatics metabolic pathways virulence genesintroductionsubjects affected by cystic fibrosis cf experience a progressive loss of pulmonary functions accompanied by an increased burden of chronic infections.

boxes report the main group of taxa detected through a cluster analysis.discussionin an endeavor to better understand the complexity of cf microbiomes in patients with highlow pulmonary function we performed a metagenomics investigation of the bacterial communities in the airways of patients with cf focusing on the identification of a set of functional features associated with different lung disease statuses in the present study.sputum specimens which represent by far the most widely used sample to access the airway microbiota of cf disease - were collected from twelve patients with cf.

in fact bacterial lung infections reduce life expectancy in patients with cf the median predicted survival age is equal to 41.6 as reported in the cystic fibrosis foundation patient registry  and represent the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cf patients .

moving away from taxonomic inventories towards a better understanding of cf microbiome genes opens a new avenue for the identification of the microbial gene repertoire associated with cf lung disease.resultsclinical characteristics of enrolled patients and culture-based diagnostic microbiologythe clinical status of the individual subjects is reported in table .

indeed virulence and resistance genes have been found to be spread throughout the whole cf bacterial community and are poorly related to the presence of single taxa suggesting that the emergence of these mechanisms should be attributed to a particular clinical condition normalmild or severe lung disease of cf patients.

understanding the role of the cf airway microbiome and detecting microbiome genes associated with lower lung function are key challenges for the delivery of new potential biomarkers for the management of bacterial infection in cf patients and the improvement of health care treatment.

no overall changes in total bacterial density with exacerbation was observed  suggesting that shifts in the relative abundance of bacterial community members rather than changes in total bacterial density are more likely to be associated with alterations in clinical state .in previous studies  we provided new insights into the features of the bacterial communities of patients with cf improving our current knowledge about the airway microbiota composition and polymicrobial interactions in patients following a severe decline in lung function and with different lung disease statuses normalmild vs. moderate vs. severe.

to date in cf metagenomics published studies have focused on the sputum derived from cf patients -.

however little is still known about the overall gene functions harbored by the resident microbial populations and which specific genes are associated with various stages of cf lung disease.

in the present study we aimed to identify the microbial gene repertoire of cf microbiota in twelve patients with severe and normalmild lung disease by performing sputum shotgun metagenome sequencing.

standardized abundances x axis were calculated as x - mxsdx where sd is the standard deviation and m is the mean value.metagenomic functional differences suggest distinct ecological roles within the cystic fibrosis microbiomein order to establish a set of gene putatively available in cf lung communities metagenomic reads were assembled into contigs.

however the limited number of patients analyzed in our study does not allow for definitive statistically-based conclusion on this issue.in addition to microbial genes involved in metabolic metabolism genes involved in antibiotic resistance are also powerful indicators of the microbial community's adaptation to the cf lung .

forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of predicted fev1 is a key outcome of the monitoring of lung function in cf .

even if on the date of sampling and in the 30 days before sample collection antibiotic administration through an iv route was not given to our patients we can hypothesize that patients with severe lung disease having an average higher age than those from the normalmild group experienced several years of exposure to antimicrobial drugs leading to periodic selection for an ar microbiota and resulting in a higher frequency and diversity of ar genes in their lung microbiota.
