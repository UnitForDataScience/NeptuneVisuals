Overall the microbiome of severely affected adults with CF seems to encode different mechanisms for the facilitation of microbial colonization and persistence in the lung consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in patients with severe lung disease.Keywords cystic fibrosis lung disease lung microbiome shotgun metagenomics bioinformatics metabolic pathways virulence genesIntroductionSubjects affected by cystic fibrosis CF experience a progressive loss of pulmonary functions accompanied by an increased burden of chronic infections.

CF patients' lungs  untargeted metagenomic approaches may provide deep insights into the microbial CF lung metagenome permitting the identification of gene sets involved in functional pathways associated with a worsening clinical condition .In the present study we performed a deep metagenomic investigation to probe the lung microbiome of twelve CF patients with mild Forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1  70 and severe FEV1  40 lung disease.

Boxes report the main group of taxa detected through a cluster analysis.DiscussionIn an endeavor to better understand the complexity of CF microbiomes in patients with highlow pulmonary function we performed a metagenomics investigation of the bacterial communities in the airways of patients with CF focusing on the identification of a set of functional features associated with different lung disease statuses in the present study.Sputum specimens which represent by far the most widely used sample to access the airway microbiota of CF disease - were collected from twelve patients with CF.

The cystic fibrosis lung microbiome.

Analysis of lung microbiota in bronchoalveolar lavage protected brush and sputum samples from subjects with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis lung disease.

Pyrosequencing unveils cystic fibrosis lung microbiome differences associated with a severe lung function decline.

In fact bacterial lung infections reduce life expectancy in patients with CF the median predicted survival age is equal to 41.6 as reported in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry  and represent the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients .

Moving away from taxonomic inventories towards a better understanding of CF microbiome genes opens a new avenue for the identification of the microbial gene repertoire associated with CF lung disease.ResultsClinical Characteristics of Enrolled Patients and Culture-Based Diagnostic MicrobiologyThe clinical status of the individual subjects is reported in Table .

Indeed virulence and resistance genes have been found to be spread throughout the whole CF bacterial community and are poorly related to the presence of single taxa suggesting that the emergence of these mechanisms should be attributed to a particular clinical condition normalmild or severe lung disease of CF patients.

Understanding the role of the CF airway microbiome and detecting microbiome genes associated with lower lung function are key challenges for the delivery of new potential biomarkers for the management of bacterial infection in CF patients and the improvement of health care treatment.
