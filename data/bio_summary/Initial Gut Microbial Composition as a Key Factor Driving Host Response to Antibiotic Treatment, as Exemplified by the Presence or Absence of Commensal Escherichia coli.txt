The results suggest that the immune homeostatic imbalance of colonic epithelium triggered by metronidazole treatment was driven by the initial commensal microbial composition profile.In the long-term metronidazole treatment experiment the stimulating effects of metronidazole on colonic commensal E. coli growth were stable .

Four-day metronidazole treatment significantly increased the abundance of E. coli to averages of 3.35 X 109 and 1.24 X 109 CFUg feces in the group with metronidazole treatment after wild mouse E. coli isolate colonization WMEC-METFIG 6 Distal colon sections from CON MET EC and EC-MET mice 4 days after metronidazolewater treatment were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

The cages were allocated to 6 treatments n  5 a no-treatment control CON wild mouse E. coli isolate colonization WMEC rat E. coli isolate colonization REC metronidazole treatment MET metronidazole treatment after wild mouseE.

The cages were allocated to 4 treatments a no-treatment control CON E. coli colonization EC metronidazole treatment MET and metronida- zole treatment after E. coli colonization EC-MET.

A recent study which used metronidazole and vancomycin to treat wild-type C57BL6 mice from Jackson Laboratory showed that the populations of members of Enterococcus and Proteobac- teriaunclassified and of novel members of Lactobacillus and Clostridium greatly expanded with metronidazole treatment and that those of Lactobacillus aviarius Enterococcus faecalisKlebsiella oxytoca and Akkermansia muciniphilia expanded with vancomycin treatment.

coli isolate-colonized mice metronidazole treatment did not significantly affect the expression of these two genes in conjunction with E. coli proliferation and .DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that the preexisting composition of commensal microbes plays an important role in how the host responds to antibiotic treatment.

For enumeration of E. coli in mouse feces samples were taken before metronidazole treatment and after 14 days A1 or 4 days B1 and C1 of metronidazolewater treatment.

Data were analyzed in a completely randomized design and the fixed effects of the treatment in the model were E. coli presence and metronidazole treatment and their interaction.

The commensal E. coli isolate successfully colonized the mouse intestine with a single dose in the group subjected to E. coli colonization only EC group and in the group given metronidazole treatment after E. coli colonization EC-MET group with levels ranging from 2.22 X 105 to 2.25 X 106 CFUg feces 2 days after exposure.

The Chao1 and Shannon index values for the intestinal microbiota in the CON and EC groups were significantly higher than those in both metronidazole-treated groups indicating that a lower level of alpha diversity resulted from metronidazole treatment P  0.05 .
