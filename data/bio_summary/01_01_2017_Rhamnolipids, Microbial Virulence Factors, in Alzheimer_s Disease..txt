It is noteworthy that statistical analysis of these results showed that the MMSE values obtained for the three cohorts of the severe moderate and mild stages of AD ranged from 10 10-19 20 respectively were found statistically significant ver- sus normal group AD MMSE 0-10 versus Normal p  0.01 AD MMSE 10-19 versus Normal p  0.016 AD MMSE 20-30 versus Normal p  0.038.

AD groups with MMSE 10 10-19 and 20 displayed statistically significant RL levels compared to the Nor- mal group AD MMSE 0-10 versus Normal p  0.01 AD MMSE 10-19 versus Normal p  0.016 AD MMSE 20-30 versus Normal p  0.038.

Sev- eral biological activities of RLs emanating from and being attributed to their detergent-like proper- ties have been identified 30 34 including immune system modulation 34 promotion of early infil- tration of primary human airway epithelia by P. aeruginosa morphological alterations in the mem- brane provoking alterations to its integrity especially by causing selective tight-junction changes to the respiratory epithelium 35 cytotoxicity induced on the fibroblastic cell line 36 hemolytic activity of erythrocytes 37 and induction of cytogenetic damage in human lymphocytes and bind DNA in vitro 38.Therefore based on the concept that AD could be attributed to bacterial infections and given that RLs are bacterial virulence factors secreted by a wide range of pathogens residing in humans the objectives of this study were a to investigate the pos- sible and temporary presence of RLs in blood serum using methods such as thin-layer chromatography TLC attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared ATR-FTIR and immune-detection meth- ods dot blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and antibodies against bacterial RLsb furthermore we endeavored to elucidate whether there are visible differentiations in the quantities of RLs present in serum and cerebrospinal fluid CSFof small cohorts of both mild cognitive impairment MCI and AD patients in comparison with nor- mal individuals and finally c to evaluate whether the increased amounts of plasma RLs would be reflected proportionally in the clinical AD progres- sive stages.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsAntibodies against RLs anti-RLs were prepared after immunizing rabbits subcutaneously with RLs using standard techniques.

Whiskers characterize lower and upper quartiles for 95 confidence interval CI of data.Detection of RLs in sera from AD patients probed with polyclonal antibodies against RLs by dot blot assayBased on the detection of RLs in blood the ques- tion raised was whether their levels may vary in the sera of AD patients and whether they could be associated with AD as bacterial metabolites.

The increased levels of RLs in AD patients may be well explained by the hypothesis suggesting a microbial population diversity residing within each individual and secreting RLs.DISCUSSIONThis article revolves around the idea of the pos- sible microbial embroilment in AD pathology via infection by pathogens an issue that constitutes a long-standing debate 3 11 12 18-29 50 51.Table 4Statistical analysis of the immune reactivity of Alzheimer's disease AD and normal groups against rhamnolipids RLs in cerebrospinal fluid samples with the ELISA methodThe depicted values shown represent mean values with standard deviations appearing in parentheses.

Moreover ELISA showed similarly elevated RL levels in cerebrospinal fluid of both AD 0.188 versus 0.080 p  0.04 and mild cognitive impairment 0.188 versus 0.129 p  0.088 patients compared to healthy and are well- correlated with the AD stages severity assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination.

These results provide conclusive evidence for the newly-reported implication of RLs in AD adding it to the list of bacterial components opening new avenues for AD investigation.

Moreover they strengthen and vindicate the divergence of research toward the exploration of bacterial involvement in AD generation and progression.Keywords Alzheimer's disease bacteria blood serum cerebrospinal fluid rhamnolipidsINTRODUCTIONAlzheimer's disease AD is a human neurode- generative disorder that displays several pathological features including the bundles of amyloid-3 plaques in the brain that occur alongside tau neurofibrillary tangles and exhibits misfolded structure and deteri- orated clearance.

The imputed role of pathogens in AD has been extensively reported for about over 200 differ- ent helical bacterial spirochete species 17 which may co-infect with other Gram-negative phylotypes 18-29.Among the extensively-studied bacterial infectious components and their inductive role in immune and inflammatory responses the involvement of RLs as microbiota-derived metabolites in AD has never been accounted for.
