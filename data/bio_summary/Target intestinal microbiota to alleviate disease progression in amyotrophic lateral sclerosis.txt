Differences among three or more groups were analysed using ANOVA with GraphPad Prism 5. p Values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.ResultsFeeding the ALS mice with butyrate delayed the ALS progressionThere are early changes of intestinal microbiome before onset of ALS.6 In the current study we developed a strategy to feed the ALS mice starting at the age of 1 month old with a natural bacterial product butyrate 2 butyrate in drinking water.

It is possible that increasing butyrate or other SCFA levels help reverse pathophysiological changes in various human diseases including ALS.Our study with oral administration of butyrate as a natural bacterial product to effectively restore microbial and intestinal homeostasis presents a different and better therapeutic strategy as evidenced by the prolonged life span by 38 days on average in the butyrate treated ALS mice.

Feeding of the G93A mice with butyrate a natural bacterial product.Results--Feeding of the G93A mice with butyrate restores the intestinal microbial homeostasis improves the gut integrity and prolongs the life span of the ALS mice.

1A control G93A mice showed weight loss indication of the disease onset at the age of 110 days while the butyrate treated G93A mice did not show weight loss until 150 days.Remarkably feeding the ALS model mice with butyrate significantly prolonged the life span by 38 days on average Fig.

Interesting Butyrate treatment also significantly depleted Tannerella27 which induced foam cell formation in THP-1 cells and accelerated the progression of atherosclerotic lesions.At the species level at the age of 3.5 months 1 month old G93A mice after butyrate treatment for 2.5 months the ALS mice with butyrate treatment significantly enriched Clostridium sp.

These data indicate butyrate treatment was able to correct abnormal intestinal tight junction structure in ALS mice.Correct leaky gut in ALS mice with butyrate treatmentThe intestinal permeability was assayed by gavaging mice with Fluorescein Dextran 50 mgg mouse.

Our data further showed human HT29C19A cells had significantly higher trans- epithelial resistant TER after butyrate treatment indicating the role of butyrate in correcting leaky gut through enhancing intestinal epithelial function Fig.

In fact butyrate enema therapy has been shown to restore intestinal homeostasis and ameliorate theZhang et al.Page 9inflammation associated with colitis in mouse models and in human clinical trials.30 31 Butyrate belongs to short chain fatty acids SCFA which modulates the physiology of the host through binding G protein-coupled receptors.32 In addition to its local beneficial functions in intestine butyrate enters the bloodstream via colonic absorption.33-35 Adiposity32 T cell differentiation36 and inflammatory responses37 are modulated by SCFAs.

G93A mice treated with 600-800mgkgday of phenylbutyrate became ill and died earlier than untreated G93A mice.38 Phenylbutyrate has been tested in ALS mice through intraperitoneal injection in previous reports under the mechanism of inhibition of histone deacetylase activity HDAC.38 It is likely that the primary effect of oral butyrate application is to improve the gut defects in ALS mice rather than via HDAC inhibition.The exact role of butyrate on intestinal and microbial function in ALS has not been examined previously.
