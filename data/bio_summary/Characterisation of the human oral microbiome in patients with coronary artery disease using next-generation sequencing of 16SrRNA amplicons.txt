alpha diversity indices were estimated by the shannon diversity index.resultsthe characteristics of the four patients with acs aged 47-60 years with three-vessel cad on angiogram and one patient with dc not known to have cad are shown in table 1. figure 1 depicts the rarefaction curve showing greater species richness in the cad samples with wide variation between the four cad samples and the highest operational taxonomiccad samples when compared to the caries sample table 2. the species abundance as well as diversity was greatest in cad4 table 3. the highest number of unclassified species and genera was also seen in the same sample table 4.a total of 31 phyla such as firmicutes bacteroidetes fusobacteria proteobacteria actinobacteria tm7 spirochaetes tenericutes cyanobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteria sr1 verrucomicrobia gn02 synergistetes planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes wwe1 ws3 wps-2 thermotogae thermi op8 od1 nkb19 nitrospirae lentisphaerae fibrobacteres elusimicrobia chlorobi and armatimonadetes were identified in all the samples.

conclusion a comparison of the oral microbiome in patients with cad and dc shows a similarity in the composition of the oral microbiota with variations in the proportion of a few genera.keywords 16srrna cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease human oral microbiome metagenomicsintroductionthere is evidence that oral bacteria are linked to a number of systemic diseases including cardiovascular disease cvd.

objectives the aim of this study was to characterize the oral microbiome in patients with coronary artery disease cad and in a patient with dental caries dc without any clinical symptoms of cad.

figures 4 and 5. the total number of genera detected in the cad samples ranged from 158 to 427 whereas it was 234 in the dc sample table 3. mannheimia a genus associated with the absence of caries was not identified in any of our samples whereas others such as neisseria cardiobacterium rothia kingella and aggregatibacter were seen in smaller numbers.figure 4 distribution of genera in coronary artery disease patients.streptococcus was the dominant genus in all the samples whereas leptotrichia capnocytophaga and prevotella were more abundant in dc when compared to cad samples.

in 2012 reported no significant qualitative changes of the oral microbiota in patients with atherosclerosis when compared with healthy controls.6 although they reported the uncultivated phylum tm7 only in the healthy control group we found it in both cad and dc patients.

coronary artery disease cad is characterised by atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries and is the leading cause of mortality in many parts of the world.1 although the disease is multifactorial microorganisms involved in chronic inflammatory processes have been implicated in atherosclerosis development.2 metagenomics is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction of dna from an environmentclinical material which avoids the bias imposed by culturing and provides information of microbial diversity including uncultivable microorganisms.

patients with periodontal disease share many of the same risk factors as patients with cvd9 suggesting that both diseases share common etiological pathways.

the predominant phylum found in both cad and dc was firmicutes 46.09  38.98 proteobacteria 17.73  9.79 fusobacteria 13.44  17.95 bacteroidetes 11.82  22.73 actinobacteria 8.33  7.71 and tm7 2.25  2.71. we found a similarity in the bacterial diversity in the two groups of patients.

periodontitis and dc are reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease as determined by clinical disease and angiography.

one patient with dental caries dc without a history of cad was also included in the study.this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike 3.0 license which allows others to remix tweak and build upon the work non-commercially as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.for reprints contact samplesmenon et al.
