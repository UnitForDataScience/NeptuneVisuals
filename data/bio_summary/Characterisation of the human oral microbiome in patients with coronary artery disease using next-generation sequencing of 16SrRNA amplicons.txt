in 2012 reported no significant qualitative changes of the oral microbiota in patients with atherosclerosis when compared with healthy controls.6 Although they reported the uncultivated phylum TM7 only in the healthy control group we found it in both CAD and DC patients.

16SrRNA gene sequencing is a goodmethod for studying phylogeny and taxonomy of samples from complex microbiomes.3 This study aims to characterise the oral microbiome in patients with CAD using 16SrRNA metagenomics.mateRials and methodsSubjectsFour patients with CAD who presented with acute coronary syndrome ACS were treated at Department of Cardiology Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital Chennai.

Preliminary analysis of the data in these patients suggests a similarity between the oral microbiome in patients with CAD and DC.Financial support and sponsorshipThis study has been carried out as part of the research program under MRU and the publication fee is met under the contingencies of the MRU Department of Health Research.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.RefeRencesGupta R. Recent trends in coronary heart disease epidemiology in India.

Objectives The aim of this study was to characterize the oral microbiome in patients with coronary artery disease CAD and in a patient with dental caries DC without any clinical symptoms of CAD.

Conclusion A comparison of the oral microbiome in patients with CAD and DC shows a similarity in the composition of the oral microbiota with variations in the proportion of a few genera.Keywords 16SrRNA cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease human oral microbiome metagenomicsintRoductionThere is evidence that oral bacteria are linked to a number of systemic diseases including cardiovascular disease CVD.

Alpha diversity indices were estimated by the Shannon diversity index.ResultsThe characteristics of the four patients with ACS aged 47-60 years with three-vessel CAD on angiogram and one patient with DC not known to have CAD are shown in Table 1.

Hence a comparison of patients withCAD and DC shows a similarity in the composition of the oral microbiota with variations in the proportion of a few genera.
