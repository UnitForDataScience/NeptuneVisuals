An understanding of this complex ecological community is import- ant as it affects our patients and manipu- lation of the gut microbiome has the potential to be used in the treatment of childhood diseases in the future.THE HUMAN MICROBIOME AN ORGAN IN ITS OWN RIGHTThe human microbiome is composed of communities of bacteria and viruses and fungi that have a greater complexity than the human genome itself.

The human microbiome has an estimated 100 trillion microbes the bulk of which live in our gut.

The concept that altered microbiome composition influences childhood allergic disease sus- ceptibility is further supported by data from epi- demiological studies that report higher prevalence of atopic diseases in infants delivered by caesarean sec- tions formula fed infants and those exposed to antibiotics.Type 1 diabetes--The gut microbiota is involved in regulation of the metabolic-immune axis.

The human microbiome asthma and allergy.

The complexity and plasticity of the infant microbiota during this early-life development is believed to be important in maintaining homeostasis with the host's immune system and has an impact on health later in life.A healthy human gut can house at least 1000 different species of bacteria com- prising of two major phyla namely Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.

The human micro-microbiome composition and diseasebiome has extensive functions such as development of immunity defence against pathogens host nutrition includ- ing production of short-chain fatty acids important in host energy metabolism synthesis of vitamins and fat storage aspathogenesis is uncertain.

Similarly changes in gut microbiota caused by lifestyle eg mode of delivery and diet are known risk factors for the development of type 1 diabetes like birth by caesarean section reportedly increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes by 20.Autistic spectrum disorder ASD--The gut micro- biota can influence human behaviour by modulating the gut-brain axis via endocrine cortisol immune cytokines and neural vagus and enteric nervous system signalling pathways.

The Toll-like receptor 2 pathway establishes colonization by a commensal of the human microbiota.
