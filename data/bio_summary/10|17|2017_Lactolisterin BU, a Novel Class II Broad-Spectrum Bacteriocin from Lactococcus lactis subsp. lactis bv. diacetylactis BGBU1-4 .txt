The maximum bacteriocin activity of the MG7284pBU6 transformant was achieved at the end of exponential phase while its activity against indicator strain Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111 was lower after 24 h of growth .Purified lactolisterin BU was active against various Gram-positive bacteria with the MICs being in the micromolar range.

The antilisterial activity of lactolisterin BU is not mediated by interaction with Man-PTS like that of other class II bacteriocins as it showed antimicrobial activity against mutant B464 .Biochemical characterization showed that lactolisterin BU like other bacteriocins is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes is relatively thermostable and is produced at maxi- mum levels in early stationary phase .

The bacterio- cins produced by LAB have been intensively explored from a fundamental perspective for their potential applications as food preservatives and more recently in veterinary and human medicine as possible alternatives to antibiotics.The positive properties of bacteriocins that make them suitable for application in the food industry are their lack of activity against and toxicity for eukaryotic cells and their sensitivity to digestive proteases.

The indigenous LAB isolated from white brined cheeses from Serbia are good candidates for screening for antimicrobial substances as they are well adapted to the microbial environments in cheese and could therefore be the source of novel properties .Aureocins are a new group of leaderless class II bacteriocins with a broad spectrum of activity that were first isolated from Staphylococcus aureus.

The spectrum of activity of L. lactis subsp.

The antimicrobial activity of purified lactolisterin BU was unchanged after heat treatment at 60degC 80degC and 100degC for 15 and 30 min compared with that after no heat treatment showing MIC values of0.67 uM against L. lactis subsp.

The genes for the production of the bacteriocin lactolisterin BU were found to be located on plasmid pBU6 which is not unusual  but the results of assays with plasmid-cured derivatives of strain BGBU1-4 suggested that its broad-spectrum anti- microbial activity is a consequence of the production of at least two bacteriocins.

Although lactolisterin BU showed some characteristics of class IIa bacteriocins antilisterial activity and the absence of unusual amino acids it does not possess the highly conserved motif T-G-N-G-VL generally found in pediocin-like bacteriocins with antilisterial activity and so cannot be classified as a class IIa bacteriocin .

The agar well diffusion assay was used to determine the spectrum of antibacterial activity of strain BGBU1-4 .

The values obtained were used to illustrate the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin lactolisterin BU.
