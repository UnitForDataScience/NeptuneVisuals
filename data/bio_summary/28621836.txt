Thus a large systematic experimental de- sign is needed to explore the influence of specific AGEs on the gut microbiota.In conclusion the intake of dietary AGEs reduced gut microbiota abundance and diversity potentially because of their resistance to digestive enzymes adversely altering gut microbiota composition.

Additionally the colonocytes structure changed and the expression of tight junction proteins in colon were decreased.Conclusion Dietary AGEs detrimentally modulate gut microbial ecology and may partially increase colon permeability which can adversely impact host health.KeywordsAdvanced glycation end products AGEs  Cecal microbiota  Colon permeability  Dietary  Microbial metaboliteAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived February 3 2017Revised June 9 2017Accepted June 12 2017IntroductionThe mammalian gastrointestinal tract houses an expansive number of microorganisms forming a microbial ecosystemCorrespondence Prof. Juxiu LiE-mail Abbreviations AGEs advanced glycation end products BC- FAs branched-chain fatty acid BSA bovine serum albumin CML NE-carboxymethyllysine H-AGE high-AGEs diet HPLC high-performance liquid chromatography L-AGE low-AGEs diet LEfSe linear discriminant analysis effect size LPS lipopolysac- charide MRPs Maillard reaction products OTUs operational tax-with their microbial metabolites.

H. The influence of diet on the gut microbiota.

Thus far the precise impact of dietary AGEs on gut microbiota remains controversial.The relevance of gut microbiota to health depends on the production of bacterial metabolites 30.

The gut microbiota com- position was altered with increased abundances of Bacteroidesand SRB such as Desulfovibrio at the expense of saccharolytic bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae and Alloprevotella these changes in the microbiota coincided with reduced acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations.
