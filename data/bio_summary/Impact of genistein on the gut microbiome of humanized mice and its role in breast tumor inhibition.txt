140534-ge 0.25 g kg and the mice on the control diet were fed a special corn oil diet without ge td 140535. teklad vitamin mix was used to make the diet more suitable for irradiation.

mice were fed ge diet or control diet and grouped into different cages based on diet and chemotherapy as shown.

in another study we demonstrated genistein's ge ability to inhibit breast cancer cell growth as well as enhance the efficacy of hormone therapy in er - breast cancer cells .asian women consume an average of 20-50 times more soy products per capita than their western counterparts and are less susceptible to developing breast cancer   which makes this compound an ideal candidate for study.

we also studied the impact of a ge diet on the microbiota on the humanized mice as well as whether the human microbiota altered ge metabolism .

c dietary ge increased the latency of tumor development by 25 for the humanized mice that were on a ge diet as compared to humanized mice on a control diet.fmt pre-chemotherapy vs fmt post-chemotherapy patient fecal sample analysisthe composition of the microbiota in fmt pre-chemotherapy patients when compared to fmt post-chemotherapy patients was similar.

understanding ge metabolism during the latency period may provide important insights to ge's mechanism of action.in summary our results demonstrated successful humanization of germ-free mice by trans- planting fecal samples from breast cancer patients.

germ-free mice on a ge diet showed dif- ferences in microbial composition as compared to mice on control diet.

animals had free access to food control irradiated diet without ge and water.diet and colonization of micemice were housed by human sample chemotherapy status and diet  4 mice cage- a total 48 mice in 12 cages.

after four weeks mice were divided into two major groups and were fed either ge diet or control diet in the form of pellets.

mice on the ge diet were fed a special corn oil customized diet from tekladenvigo td.
