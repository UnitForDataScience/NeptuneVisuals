Mice were fed GE diet or control diet and grouped into different cages based on diet and chemotherapy as shown.

The groups showed differences in clustering between the controls and two-weeks post start of the GE diet further clustering evident in the same mice four-weeks post induction of diet.

c Dietary GE increased the latency of tumor development by 25 for the humanized mice that were on a GE diet as compared to humanized mice on a control diet.FMT pre-chemotherapy vs FMT post-chemotherapy patient fecal sample analysisThe composition of the microbiota in FMT pre-chemotherapy patients when compared to FMT post-chemotherapy patients was similar.

We also studied the impact of a GE diet on the microbiota on the humanized mice as well as whether the human microbiota altered GE metabolism .

Germ-free mice on a GE diet showed dif- ferences in microbial composition as compared to mice on control diet.

Animals had free access to food control irradiated diet without GE and water.Diet and colonization of miceMice were housed by human sample chemotherapy status and diet  4 mice cage- a total 48 mice in 12 cages.

After four weeks mice were divided into two major groups and were fed either GE diet or control diet in the form of pellets.
