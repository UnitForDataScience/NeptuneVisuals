while the importance of cell-extrinsic factors in cancer initiation and progression including contributions from the tme is well established our understanding of the tme's influence on therapeutic outcome is in its infancy.

further insights into how tumor cells co-opt intrinsic or drug- induced features of the tme to survive therapy may allow us to generate new treatment strategies that can target crit- ical tme factors that promote resistance.

instead tumor cells arise in the context of non-malignant cellular and non-cellular components of a tissue defined as the tumor microenvironement tme.

current studies have begun to address this question and have uncovered novel roles for the tme in modulating therapeutic efficacy.

in the case of chemoresistance the tme has now been shown to directly promote treatment failure by a diverse set of mechanisms some of which are high- lighted in a-1c  .

however the concept that neoplastic cells can co-opt pre- existing or treatment-induced signaling networks to survive therapy has emerged as a clear unifying component of treat- ment failure.tumors that arise at epithelial barrier surfaces of the body have the additional feature of harboring an extensive micro- biota in the tme and the importance of these microbes in human health and dis- ease is now widely appreciated.

mounting evidence in colorectal cancer crc for instance has linked the microbiota resi- dent in the tme to cancer initiation and progression.

present a novel mechanism by which the tme promotes chemoresistance in this issue of cell.

similarly the study by yu and colleagues was completed in tumor xenografts that developed outside the normal crc tme and were directly injected with fn to elicit a resistance phenotype.
