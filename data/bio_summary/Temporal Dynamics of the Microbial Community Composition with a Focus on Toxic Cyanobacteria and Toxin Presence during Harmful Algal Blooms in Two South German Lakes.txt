The family Saprospiraceae in The Prokaryotes Other Major Lineages of Bacteria and the Archaea eds E. Rosenberg E. F. Delong S. Lory E. Stackebrandt and F. Thompson Berlin Springer 863-889.McMurdie P. J. and Holmes S. 2014.

The bacterial community composition of Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria remained stable over time in Lake Klostersee but it showed temporal variations in Lake Bergknappweiher.

The most widespread molecular methods for the study of aquatic microbiomes are denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE     terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism T-RFLP     Sanger sequencing of clone libraries       and more recently high-throughput sequencing          .So far only a few studies have combined high-throughput sequencing-based assessment of cyanobacterial community composition with toxic genotype quantification by qPCR      and even fewer included microcystin measurements  .

The second most abundant phylum in this lake was Proteobacteria.Cyanobacterial Community CompositionThe community composition of Cyanobacteria in Lake Klostersee changed considerably over the sampling period .

The community composition of Cyanobacteria in Lake Bergknappweiher changed during the sampling period in particular at the OTU level .

The dominant OTU in the Alphaproteobacteria community was a member of the order Sphingomonadales OTU2 and a member of the family Pelagibacteraceae OTU3.

The different chloroplast orders showed distinctive correlations with environmental parametersFIGURE 3  Non-cyanobacteria community composition in Lake Klostersee left and Lake Bergknappweiher right at the OTU level 97 sequence identity.

The peculiar and constant community composition of both Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria in LakeBergknappweiher between 07 October and 21 Octoer 2015  coincided with the overwhelming dominance of Dolichospermum OTU1 .

The fact that high relative abundances of Sphingomonadales and Limnohabitans were not observed in Lake Klostersee while the same Dolichospermum dominated the cyanobacterial community 29 May and 12 June 2015 can be explained by the overall lower relative abundance of cyanobacteria in Lake Klostersee.The data from our study complement other studies that have looked at the cyanobacterial bloom associated BCC        .

The fact that the potential algicidal bacteria Sphingobacteriales and Saprospiracea OTU23 27 and30 are amongst the most abundant Bacteroidetes  hints toward a potential role in regulation of the bacterial community composition.
