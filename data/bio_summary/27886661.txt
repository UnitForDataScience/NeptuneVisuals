It should be underlined that so far competition has been described only for Asaia a symbiont that has never been described in D. suzukii or other Drosophila flies.In conclusion AAB's high prevalence in individuals fed on both diet types their localization and ability to mas- sively recolonize the insect gut indicate that AAB are major components of the D. suzukii microbiota and simi- larly to D. melanogaster they might play important roles in the physiology and behaviour of the host.

Prevalence of AAB and Wolbachia in D. suzukiispecimens.Fifty D. suzukii adults 25 males and 25 females reared on fruits and the same number of specimens maintained on artificial diet were used for assessing the prevalence of dif- ferent AAB and Wolbachia.

Orders under 3.Principal coordinate analysis PCoA on the phylogenetic b-diversity matrix on D. suzukii samples considering all the bacterial OTUs.Principal coordinate analysis PCoA on the phylogenetic b-diversity matrix on D. suzukii samples considering all the bacterial OTUs except for the ones belonging to AAB group.

The AAB diversity shifts and their weight in determining the clus- tering behaviour of the bacterial microbiota in relation to diet might indicate their crucial role in determining the microbiota response to diet in D. suzukii gut.Experimental proceduresInsectsField-captured larvae of D. suzukii emerging from blue- berries raspberries and blackberries in orchards of the Cuneo province Piedmont North-West Italy in summer 2013 have been reared for at least eight generations in laboratory condition both on fruits strawberries blueber- ries grapes and kiwi fruits and on a sugar-based artifi- cial diet composed with 71 g of corn flour 10 g of soy flour 5.6 g of agar 15 g of sucrose 17 g of brewer's yeast 4.7 ml of propionic acid 2.5 g of vitamins mix for each Kg of the preparation at the Dipartimento di Sci- enze Agrarie Forestali e Alimentari DISAFA University of Torino.

16S rRNA sequen- ces of representative isolates have been deposited in the ENA database under the accession numbers LN884027-LN884133.Localization of D. suzukii AAB by fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH and colonization experiments with Gfp-labelled strainsFISH has been carried out on tissues and organs dissect- ed from mass-reared D. suzukii adults in a sterile saline solution.

High prevalence localization and massive recolonization together with AAB clustering behav- iour in relation to diet suggest an AAB role in the D. suzukii gut response to diet modification.IntroductionThe insect gut microbiota plays very critical and essen- tial roles for the host biology physiology and immunity Hamdi et al.

The AAB localization observed in the gut of D. suzukii confirmed that guts of sugar-feeding insects are primary habitat for AAB inwhich they establish strict topological and presumably functional connections with the epithelial cells Crotti et al.
