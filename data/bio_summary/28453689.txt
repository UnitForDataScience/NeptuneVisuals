As yet the mechanisms linking oral disease and PC are uncertain but could be related to changes in the oral microbiome--an area of current research.Key words periodontal disease periodontitis edentulism pancreas cancer meta-analysisPancreatic cancer PC is relatively infrequent but ranks as the fourth most common cause of cancer death .

More informative the recently reported prospective CPS-II andPLCO cohort studies provides supportive evidence that oral microbiota may play a role in the etiology of PC in particular since the association remained after exclusion of cases that de- veloped within 2 years of sample collection .There is also good evidence that the oral microbiome and PD are associated with other forms of cancer in particular oral  esophageal  gastric  and colorectal cancer .The mechanism by which the oral microbiota might contribute to the development of PC is still evolving.

Estimates of the fraction of PC attributable to known preventable risk factors range from 24 in China  or Japan  to 36 in the United Kingdom .Periodontal disease PD and alterations in the oral micro- biome which are responsible for its development have been linked to several forms of cancer including cancer of the oral cav- ity head and neck and cancer of the pancreas -.VC The Author 2017.

Because it is age-related and since popula- tions in most countries are ageing the absolute number of PC cases is increasing PC is anticipated to be the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States by 2020  .PC has been extensively studied and many risk factors includ- ing tobacco smoking heavy alcohol drinking red meat fruits and vegetables consumption obesity diabetes mellitus meta- bolic syndrome chronic pancreatitis helicobacter pyloriinfection ABO blood group or allergy have been identified and often confirmed by meta-analyses.

Most of the studies were adjusted for variables thought to be associated with PC such as gender smoking BMI diabetes and alcohol.Conclusions Using meta-analysis both periodontitis and edentulism appear to be associated with PC even after adjusting for common risk factors.

Globally severe periodontitis and edentulism affect respectively 743 million and 158 million peo- ple worldwide -.The purpose of this study is to review the literature and to em- ploy meta-analytic techniques to quantify the association be- tween periodontitis edentulism and PC risk.Search strategy inclusion criteria and data abstractionWe carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed without language or other restrictions looking for papers refer- ring to PD and PC.

Finally a recent nested case-control study based on longitu- dinal data from two prospective cohort studies the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II and the National Cancer Institute Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial revealed significant increased risk of PC with car- riage of P. gingivalis OR 14 1.60 95 CI 1.15-2.22 and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans OR 14 2.20 95 CI 1.16- 4.18 assessed from pre-diagnostic oral wash samples using bac- terial 16S ribosomal RNA 16S rRNA gene sequencing .Volume 28  Issue 5  2017doi10.1093annoncmdx019  987Annals of OncologyReviewWe carried out a review of the literature and identified eight studies reporting on the association between PD or edentulism a consequence of PD and PC risk.

The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review and a meta- analysis of the relationship between PD edentulism and pancreatic cancer PC.Patients and methods From an initial review of 327 references we selected eight studies concerning periodontitis or edentulism with sufficient quantitative information to allow us to examine the risk of PC.

for PD RR 1.35 95 CI 1.23-1.47 in a meta-analysis of 28 observa- tional studies.The association between diabetes and PC whether as a risk fac- tor or an early manifestation or a consequence of the cancer has also been reviewed.
