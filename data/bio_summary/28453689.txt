more informative the recently reported prospective cps-ii andplco cohort studies provides supportive evidence that oral microbiota may play a role in the etiology of pc in particular since the association remained after exclusion of cases that de- veloped within 2 years of sample collection .there is also good evidence that the oral microbiome and pd are associated with other forms of cancer in particular oral  esophageal  gastric  and colorectal cancer .the mechanism by which the oral microbiota might contribute to the development of pc is still evolving.

pd with treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk of pc hr 0.55 95 ci 0.35- 0.85. finally a recent nested case-control study based on longitu- dinal data from two prospective cohort studies the american cancer society cancer prevention study ii and the national cancer institute prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial revealed significant increased risk of pc with car- riage of p. gingivalis or 14 1.60 95 ci 1.15-2.22 and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or 14 2.20 95 ci 1.16- 4.18 assessed from pre-diagnostic oral wash samples using bac- terial 16s ribosomal rna 16s rrna gene sequencing .volume 28  issue 5  2017doi10.1093annoncmdx019  987annals of oncologyreviewwe carried out a review of the literature and identified eight studies reporting on the association between pd or edentulism a consequence of pd and pc risk.

the endogenous formation of nitrosamines has been found to be substantially higher among individuals with poor oral hygiene than among those with good oral hygiene .major strengths of this meta-analysis are lack of heterogeneityof risk estimates across studies the absence of evidence of publi- cation bias and the presence studies supporting the role of micro- biota in pc development.

further adjustment for tobacco smoking was made in six studies       for alcohol drinking in three studies - for diabetes in three studies    or for body mass index bmi in four studies    .

gingivitis or studies considering the effect of treatment of pd were used a supporting material but could not be included in the meta-analysis.statistical analysisrrs or hazard ratios cohort studies and odds ratios case-con- trol studies were used as a measure of the association between pd and pc.

limiting analysis to cohort studies or excluding atyp- ical studies such as the one by chang which relied on health claim data  does not significantly change the results and conclu- sions data not shown.our results are based on a relatively limited number of pub- lished reports but are supported by additional studies showing a significant increased risk of pc associated with carriage of known periodontopathic pathogens and with plasma level of porphyromonas gingivalis p. gingivalis   .

as yet the mechanisms linking oral disease and pc are uncertain but could be related to changes in the oral microbiome--an area of current research.key words periodontal disease periodontitis edentulism pancreas cancer meta-analysispancreatic cancer pc is relatively infrequent but ranks as the fourth most common cause of cancer death .

information on dental status and pd were obtained by dental examination in three studies    were self-reported in four studies     or were derived from a health claim database in one study .the summary rr srr and 95 ci using random effect model for periodontitis and edentulism are respectively 1.74 95 ci 1.41-2.15 and 1.54 95 ci 1.16-2.05 with no evi-dence of heterogeneity i214 0 for either variables or publica- tion bias macaskill's test p 14 0.30 and p 14 0.90 respectively figures and .risk estimates from single studies ranged from 1.55 95 ci 1.02-2.33 to 4.56 95 ci 0.93-22.3 for periodontitis and from1.30 95 ci 0.70-2.30 to 1.90 95 ci 0.95-3.81 for edentu-lism.

using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes 2009-2012 vogtmann et al.found a very similar risk between current cigarette smoking and pd rr 1.70 95 ci 1.57-1.86. heavy alcohol intake 230 gramsday or 3 drinksday has also been consistently associ- ated with a modest increase risk of pc in pooled analyses of indi- vidual data from cohort studies rr 1.22 95 ci 1.03-1.45and similarly from case-control studies rr 1.22 95 ci 1.01-1.48 .

most of the studies were adjusted for variables thought to be associated with pc such as gender smoking bmi diabetes and alcohol.conclusions using meta-analysis both periodontitis and edentulism appear to be associated with pc even after adjusting for common risk factors.

although this risk estimate was not included in the meta-analysis its magnitude rr 1.61 95 ci 1.13-2.31 is similar to the srr estimated for edentulism.five other studies reported pertinent information on the associ- ation between oral health periodontitis or microbiome and pc risk table  -.

estimates of the fraction of pc attributable to known preventable risk factors range from 24 in china  or japan  to 36 in the united kingdom .periodontal disease pd and alterations in the oral micro- biome which are responsible for its development have been linked to several forms of cancer including cancer of the oral cav- ity head and neck and cancer of the pancreas -.vc the author 2017. published by oxford university press on behalf of the european society for medical oncology.
