Environmental biotechnologyIntroductionThiocyanate SCN- is present at high concentrations in the waste-streams of gold mining and coal gasification Dash et al.

through the reaction between its precursor com- pounds cyanide CN- and reduced sulphur Mudder et al.

Disposal and storage of SCN--containing waste often results in contamination of ground- and surface-waters due to the use of unlined storage facilities Kossoff et al.

Although less toxic than its precursor CN- SCN- can accu- mulate to concentrations toxic to plant and animal life Bhunia et al.

Gould et al.

The ability of somemicroorganisms to degrade SCN- offers a cost-effective and scalable approach to SCN- remediation.A number of microorganisms are capable of SCN- degra-dation utilizing it as an energy nitrogen sulphur andor car- bon source Gould et al.

The former pathway is well-characterized proceeding by twostages mediated by the action of SCN--hydrolase and COS- hydrolase enzymes Katayama et al.

Ogawa et al.

The latter pathway is proposed to proceed via a thiocyanatecytochrome c oxidoreductase to CNO- and ele- mental sulphur  S0 identified in species of the Thioalkalivibrio genus Berben et al.

Significantly CNO- formed abiotically from urea or cyanide has recently been recognized as a potentially important source of reduced nitrogen for nitrifying microorganisms Palatinszky et al.
