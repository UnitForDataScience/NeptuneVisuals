similarly an increase in myeloperoxidase mpo protein a surrogate indicator of neutrophil infiltration in colonic homogenates was significantly lower in the dssbr and dssr-br groups than in the dsswr group table 3. il-6 and inf-g in colon homogenates were also greater in the dss-treated mice fed with the wr diet than in the negative control mice fed with the wr diet table 3. the amounts of il-6 and inf-g in the proximal colon from the dss-treated mice fed with the br and r-br diets were significantly less than those in the mice receiving dss and fed with the wr diet table 3.t cell composition in the mlnto explore the underlying mechanism effect of br and r-br on dss-induced colitis treg th1 and th17 cells in the mln were analyzed.

median values with different superscript letters in the same row are significantly different p  0.05.enterococcus in the dss treated mice were significantly increased in comparison with that in the control wr group the relative abundance of bacteroides in the dssbr and dssr-br groups was decreased approximately one half of that in the dsswr group table 6. interestingly the relative abundance of enterococcus in the dssr-br group significantly reduced down to zero table 6. compared to the dss treated mice fed with the wr diet the relative abundance of turicibacter and ruminococcus significantly increased in the dssbr mice table 6. the dssr-br group had a signifi- cantly greater proportion of prevotella ruminococcus doreacoprococcus and dehalobacterium than the dsswr group table 6.discussionibd is characterized by longstanding chronic inflammatory disease and its pathogenesis may result from the dysfunction of the host immune response with an imbalance of pathogenic and protective gut microbiome population or dysbiosis.48-51 in addition decreased bacterial diversity and lower numbers ofbacteria responsible for the production of short chain fatty acids scfa such as butyrate were also observed in ibd patients.52 the present study showed that the inclusion of br and r-br in the diet of mice treated with dss exhibited a significantly lower ratio of colonic weight to length and a lower content of inos cox-2 mpo il-6 and inf-g in colonic homogenates than the identically treated mice fed with the wr diet.

6b.firmicutes was the predominant phylum with an abun- dance of 83.2 followed by 13.9 bacteroidetes 0.31 proteobacteria and 2 unclassified bacteria in the control wr group table 4. the dss treatment of mice fed with the wr diet reduced the relative abundance of firmicutes and increased those of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria table 4.the relative abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes was increased and decreased respectively in the dssbr group compared to the dsswr group while there was no sig- nificant effect of diet on the relative abundance of phyla between the dsswr and dssr-br groups table 4. the dss treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of bacteroidaceae and enterobacteriaceae families in compari- son with the control mice fed with the wr diet whereas the abundance of unclassified clostridiales was significantly reduced fig.

the mice were divided into 4 groups and fed with the following experimental diets for 4 weeks 1 negative control wr diet with wr 2 positive control dsswr dss and diet with wr 3 dssbr dss and diet with br and 4 dssr-br dss and diet with r-br.

the fa administration also significantly restored the histopathological aberration induced by tnbs.55 thus the anti-inflammatory effect on the dss treated mice fed with br and r-br in the present study may be attributed to such active compounds in rice bran.a number of studies reported the anti-colitic activity of various types of resistant starch in experimental rats and mice.55657 colonic pathology mpo activity and glutathione concentrations were improved in the rats fed with a diet sup- plemented with dwarf banana containing rs2 in addition to the prednisone administration compared to the rats treated with prednisone only.57 another study reported that the dss- induced colitis mice fed with a diet supplemented with 5 high amylose maize starch rs2 had lower disease activityindices and histopathology scores than those which received a control diet and a diet supplemented with red meat.56 recently azoxymethane aomdss induced colitis rats fed with a 20 high amylose maize starch diet increased the colon length lowered the inflammation score and restored the colonic lamina propria architecture compared to the control rats.

6b microbial diversity decreased significantly in the dss treated mice fed with the wr diet relative to the control mice fed with the same identical wr diet.

the potential role of enterococcus in the devel- opment of colitis has also been demonstrated in il-10 gene knockout mice.66 the dss treated mice fed with the r-br diet in the present study had a lower relative abundance of bacteroides and enterococcus than the dss treated control mice table 6.the dss treated mice fed with the r-br diet had a greater abundance of ruminococcus dorea dehalobacterium and coprococcus than the dsswr group  p  0.05 table 6. a pre- vious study reported that a diet supplemented with rs increased the abundance of ruminococcus subdoligranulum solobacterium coprococcus and turicibacter in the cecum and colon of pigs.47 ruminococcus has been reported to degrade and ferment resistant starch to scfas.6768 coprococcus buty- rate producing bacteria69 was decreased in the dsswr group compared to the negative control group table 6. shaw et al.70 reported that coprococcus was decreased in pediatric ibd com- pared to controls and further decreased in non-responders to the treatment in comparison with responders to the treatment.

the statistical analysis of the bacterial community was performed by r.44resultsnutrient and bioactive compound content of rice powderthe macronutrient and fiber contents of wr br and r-br powders are shown in esi table 1. the br and r-br diets had a greater fat and fiber content than wr  p  0.05. the per- centage of rs in wr was 4.1 - 0.2 while that of the retro- graded br was significantly higher 7.8 - 0.4 than that of the common br powder 4.4 - 0.3. in addition br and r-br had a higher content of gaba g-oryzanol g-tocotrienolferulic acid and p-coumaric acid than wr  p  0.05 but no sig- nificant difference was noted between br and r-br esi table 3.evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effects of br and r-br in dss-induced colitis miceno mortality was observed in all treatment groups.

the negative control mice fed with the modified ain93g diet containing wr wr group without the dss treatment lacked clinical signs of colonic inflammation as shown in fig.

1 mice were fed with various experimental diets and induced colitis by 2 dss in water on the 3rd week of the experimental period for 7 days and further fed with experimental diets without dss for another 7 days as described in materials and methods.

the same study also found that the mice fed with rs-con- taining diets had reduced inflammation markers cox-2 nf- kb tnf-a il-1b mrna and increased colonic cell prolifer- ation and scfa content which likely resulted from substantial shifts in the composition and diversity of colonic microbiota.5 another study reported that the dss-induced mice fed with a diet containing resistant starch type 3 rs3 as a carrier and stachyose reduced serum il-6 and tnf-a to a greater extent compared with the mice fed with the same concentration of stachyose combined with ordinary starch stachyose  starch.

the amounts of these inflammatory pro- teins in the colon of the dss-treated mice fed with the br and r-br diets were significantly less than those in the mice fed with the wr diet.

rs4 is a chemically modified starch and is resistant to enzymatic digestion.1 the health benefits of rs have been demonstrated in animals and humans.2-4 rs has been used for the management of metabolic diseases includ- ing the improvement of insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia.3 recently colitis-associated colorectal rats fed with dietary rs had lower tumor multiplicity and adenocarcinoma formation than the control group.5 additionally the rats fed with the rs rich diet had an altered microbial compositiondiversity increased luminal short chain fatty acid scfa content and colonic cell proliferation but reduced inflammation markers compared to the control group.5 butyrate a short chain fattyacid has been demonstrated to modulate the colonic immune system by the reduction of leukocyte infiltration in dextran sulfate sodium dss induced mucosal colitis mice and the improvement of the inflammatory profile in mesenteric lymph nodes.6inflammatory bowel disease ibd is classified into 2 different types but closely related to the chronic relapsing inflammation of the colon crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.7 accumulating evidence indicates that luminal bacteria partly play a role in the development of ibd pathogenesis and its chronicity.8 the interaction between residential bacteria in the large intestine and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in maintaining gut health and preventing the development of ibd pathogenesis.9 due to these findings a clinical trial in ibd patients has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic and prebiotic administration to manipulate gut microflora by selectively stimulating the growth andor the activity of beneficial bacteria.10 experimental colitis mice indicated that the disruption of the mucosal barrier func- tion initiated pathologic immune responses by alteration of luminal bacteria resulting in acute and chronic colitis.81112 thus improving the gut mucosal barrier integrity may contrib- ute to reduce colonic inflammation.
