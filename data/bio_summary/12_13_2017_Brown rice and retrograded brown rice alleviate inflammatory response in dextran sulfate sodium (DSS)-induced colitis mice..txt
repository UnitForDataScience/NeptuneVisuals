The mice were divided into 4 groups and fed with the following experimental diets for 4 weeks 1 negative control WR diet with WR 2 positive control DSSWR DSS and diet with WR 3 DSSBR DSS and diet with BR and 4 DSSR-BR DSS and diet with R-BR.

The FA administration also significantly restored the histopathological aberration induced by TNBS.55 Thus the anti-inflammatory effect on the DSS treated mice fed with BR and R-BR in the present study may be attributed to such active compounds in rice bran.A number of studies reported the anti-colitic activity of various types of resistant starch in experimental rats and mice.55657 Colonic pathology MPO activity and glutathione concentrations were improved in the rats fed with a diet sup- plemented with dwarf banana containing RS2 in addition to the prednisone administration compared to the rats treated with prednisone only.57 Another study reported that the DSS- induced colitis mice fed with a diet supplemented with 5 high amylose maize starch RS2 had lower disease activityindices and histopathology scores than those which received a control diet and a diet supplemented with red meat.56 Recently azoxymethane AOMDSS induced colitis rats fed with a 20 high amylose maize starch diet increased the colon length lowered the inflammation score and restored the colonic lamina propria architecture compared to the control rats.

The amounts of IL-6 and INF-g in the proximal colon from the DSS-treated mice fed with the BR and R-BR diets were significantly less than those in the mice receiving DSS and fed with the WR diet Table 3.T cell composition in the MLNTo explore the underlying mechanism effect of BR and R-BR on DSS-induced colitis Treg Th1 and Th17 cells in the MLN were analyzed.

6b microbial diversity decreased significantly in the DSS treated mice fed with the WR diet relative to the control mice fed with the same identical WR diet.

The potential role of Enterococcus in the devel- opment of colitis has also been demonstrated in IL-10 gene knockout mice.66 The DSS treated mice fed with the R-BR diet in the present study had a lower relative abundance of Bacteroides and Enterococcus than the DSS treated control mice Table 6.The DSS treated mice fed with the R-BR diet had a greater abundance of Ruminococcus Dorea Dehalobacterium and Coprococcus than the DSSWR group  p  0.05 Table 6.

The cooked rice was further left in the steaming cooker for 10 min and then spread on an aluminum plate prior to dry heat treat- ment at 35-40 degC for 24 h. Retrograded BR R-BR preparation was performed using a modified protocol from Lasukhang et al.28 the cooked BR spread on an aluminum plate was stored at 4-8 degC for 24 h. Thereafter the cold stored samples of the cooked BR were applied with dry heat at 35-40 degC for another 24 h. The dry heat cooked samples WR BR and R-BR were ground by using a commercial blender Phillip Thailand and then passed through a 25 mesh sieve to obtain homo- geneous fine flour.

4c and d in the proximal and distal colon in the mice fed with the WR diet compared to that in the negative control mice fed with WR.

IL-6 and INF-g in colon homogenates were also greater in the DSS-treated mice fed with the WR diet than in the negative control mice fed with the WR diet Table 3.

The amounts of these inflammatory pro- teins in the colon of the DSS-treated mice fed with the BR and R-BR diets were significantly less than those in the mice fed with the WR diet.
