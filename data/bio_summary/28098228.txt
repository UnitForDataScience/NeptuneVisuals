unifrac distance and correspondence analyses revealed that water deer harbored an increased abundance of pseudomonas spp.

and acinetobacter spp.

while milk from reindeer and goat was dominated by unclassified bacteria from the family hyphomicrobiaceae and bacillus spp.

the presence of halomonas spp.

conversely the milk of goat was dominated by bacteria belonging to the firmicutes 65.8 - 29.1 and proteobacteria 32.9 - 28.3 1a.at the genus level the milk of water deer was dominated by pseudomonas spp.

accounting for 12.2 - 2.2 of the observed genera followed by acinetobacter spp.

11.6 - 3.9 chryseobacterium spp.

5.4 - 3.5 corynebacterium 15.2 - 3.2 and comamonas spp.

3.8 - 2.0. in the milk of reindeer unclassi- fied bacteria from the family hyphomicrobiaceae 31.7 - 11.1 were dominant followed by unclassified cyanobacteria 20.0 - 11.8 and halomonas spp.

16.2 - 6.3. the milk of goat was dominated by bacillus spp.

48.9 - 30.3 followed by serratia spp.

12.7 - 7.7 staphylococcus spp.

11.7 - 11.1 andpseudomonas spp.

moreover a correspondence analysis based on the abundance of an indicator genus which was used to characterize each group was used to identify influential bacteria that facilitated differences across all three hosts c. the milk of water deer was predominantly characterized by pseudomonas spp.

12.2 - 2.2 acinetobacter spp.
