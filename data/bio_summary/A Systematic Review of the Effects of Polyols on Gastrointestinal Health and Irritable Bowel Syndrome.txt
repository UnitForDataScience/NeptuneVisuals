However to our knowledge few studies in adult patients have specifi- cally examined the relation between polyol consumption and gastrointestinal motility.Studies in healthy volunteersAlthough there are few data on the effects of polyols on gas- trointestinal motility in healthy volunteers several studies from the surgical literature evaluated the effects of chewing sugar-free gum which contains various polyols on postsur- gical recovery of gastrointestinal function and motility 43 44.

Accelerated small bowel transit time seen with pol- yol ingestion also results in increased osmosis and water re- tention within the small bowel lumen and correlates with increased abdominal discomfort in healthy individuals 46.

45 performed a randomized controlled trial of 109 women 53 study patients and 56 controls undergoing laparoscopic surgery to evaluate the effects of xylitol chewing gum on gas- trointestinal motility which was measured as the time to first bowel sounds flatus and bowel movement.

Differences in the faecal flora of healthy individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome and in vitro effects of a synbiotic upon gut flora composition.

Thus it is important to understand how polyols affect the gut mi- crobiome in healthy persons and patients with IBS.Studies in healthy volunteersThere are some data from animal and human studies which have addressed the effects of polyols such as xylitol isomalt and lactitol on the gut microbiome.

This allows diversi- fication of the diet in most patients encouraging adherence and minimizing any potentially hazardous effects on the mi- crobiome 73.Gastrointestinal SymptomsStudies in healthy individualsAs previously mentioned malabsorption of polyols may in- duce laxative effects as well as flatulence bloating and ab- dominal discomfort in sensitive individuals 10.
