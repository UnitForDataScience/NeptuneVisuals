These reactions include the NF-kBimmune-deficiency Imd pathway that kills parasites in the midgut lumen and epithelium through an as yet uncharacterized mechanism 1 2 and a complement-like pathway that eliminates ookinetes soon after crossing the epithelium and before transforming into oocysts 3.In Drosophila the Imd pathway is elicited by bacterial peptidoglycan via the peptidoglycan recognition protein PGRP LC 4 5.

Induction of the Imd pathway by heterodimerization has been reported in Drosophila between PGRPLCx which binds peptidoglycan and PGRPLCa which does not 25.Our results also identify PGRPLB as a negative regulator of the Imd pathway promoting tolerance to P. falciparum.

In our experimental setting the role of PGRPLB on Plasmodium infection is probably reduced due to the fact that PGRPLB is itself a target of the Imd pathway 30 hence its silencing may induce Imd pathway activation leading to its overexpression.

We followed the expression of Cecropin1 CEC1 an antibacterial gene induced by the Imd pathway in the midguts of sugar- and blood-fed mosquitoes 3 and 4 days after dsRNA injection respectively in order to follow the blood meal-induced Imd response 1.

Our data demonstrate that PGRPs are important regulators of the mosquito epithelial immunity and vector competence.Keywords Peptidoglycan recognition protein Anopheles Drosophila Immune-deficiency pathway Antimicrobial peptides Plasmodium Microbiota BacteriaIntroductionIn sub-Saharan Africa malaria parasites are mainly transmitted by 2 sibling species of mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii.

In that respect published data suggest that PGRPLA1 and PGRPLA2 expression differs between mosquito strains and Plasmodium infection stages 21 22 23 24 and we found that PGRPLA2 expression is 14 and 10 times lower than that of PGRPLA1 in the midguts of sugar- and blood-fed mosquitoes of our colony respectively.

A deletion of the gene is required to determine the full effect of PGRPLB in Plasmodium infections.Taken together our data demonstrate that PGRPs are key regulators of the mosquito immune system and permissiveness to Plasmodium.

Indeed sequence alignment revealed that 810 amino acids involved in binding peptidoglycan in PGRPLCx are absent from PGRPLA1 .PGRPLB Downregulates Systemic Induction of the Imd PathwayWe also investigated whether PGRPLB is a negative regulator of the Imd pathway similarly to its Drosophila ortholog 6 7.

We also demonstrate that following a mosquito blood feeding which promotes growth of the gut microbiota PGRPLA and PGRPLB positively and negatively regulate the activation of the Imd pathway respectively.

This suggests that the exact sequences of PGRPLA transcripts may need further investigation.In Drosophila the receptors PGRPLC and PGRLE induce the Imd pathway through a RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif RHIM which is also present in Drosophila PGRPLA 17.
