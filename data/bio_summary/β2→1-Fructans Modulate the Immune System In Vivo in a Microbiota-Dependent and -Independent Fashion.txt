gating strategy and representative Facs plots mesenteric lymph nodes sample for identifying T cell subsets.a Among CD3CD4 T cells the percentage of Tregs Foxp3CD25 Th1 cells T-bet Th17 cells RORgt and Th2 cells GATA-3 was identified.

Both short- and long-chain b2-1-fructans enhanced T-helper 1 cells in PPs whereas only short-chain b2-1-fructans increased regulatory T cells and CD11b-CD103- dendritic cells DCs in the MLN.

For example short-chain b2-1-fructans have been demonstrated to increase IgA secretion and production of IL-10 and interferon-g by CD4 T cells from Peyer's patches PPs in mice   whereas long-chain b2-1-fructans induced higher numbers of dendritic cells in PPs and greater ex vivo secretion of IL-2 IL-10 and interferon-g from spleen and mesenteric lymph node MLN cells after administration to rats .

In addition the percentage of CD69 cells was identified among CD3CD4 and CD3CD8 cells.FigUre s3  Facs plots B cells and dendritic cells Dcs.

In conclusion support of immunity is determined by the chemical structure of b2-1-fructans and is partially microbiota independent.Keywords b2-1-fructans prebiotics gut microbiota mucosal immunology germ-free miceinTrODUcTiOnThe intestinal tract contains the largest pool of immune cells in the body which are separated by only a single layer of epithelial cells from an enormous amount of environmental stimuli including the gut microbiota and dietary components .

In addition in MLNs short- chain b2-1-fructan but not long-chain b2-1-fructan treatmentresulted in higher percentages of Treg cells p  0.05 and CD4 T cells expressing the activation marker CD69 p  0.05.

Percentage of cells stained with isotype control was subtracted to determine the percentage of true positive cells.

In addition metabolites produced after fermentation of b2-1-fructans by commensal gut bacteria include short-chain fatty acids SCFAs which dampen inflammatory responses by binding to G protein-coupled receptors GPR41 GPR43 and GPR109A expressed on different types of immune cells -.

Recently we also demonstrated that b2-1-fructans can stimulate immune cells directly in vitro via activating pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors TLRs .
