Remarkably BALBc Lcn2KO mice exhibited rectal prolapse a severe form of colitis upon IL-10R neutralization F. Histological analysis--extent of inflammatory cell infiltrate ICI epithelial hyperplasia goblet cell loss and distorted crypt structure G and H-- further established that BALBc Lcn2KO mice develop a severe chronic colitis upon IL-10R neutralization when compared to WT control.Experimental design materials and methodsMiceLcn2KO mice and their WT littermates on BALBc background were maintained under specific- pathogen-free conditions in the animal house facility at Pennsylvania State University PA. Mice were housed in cages max.

The data presented here elucidate that the robust chronic colitis observed in aIL- 10R-treated C57BL6 Lcn2KO mice can be recapitulated in BALBc Lcn2KO mice.

2016 where we have demonstrated that C57BL6 Lipocalin 2 deficient mice Lcn2KO developed chronic colitis upon anti-interleukin-10 receptor aIL-10R monoclonal antibody adminis-tration.

In the present article we evaluated the susceptibility of BALBc Lcn2KO mice and their WT littermates to the aIL-10R neutralization-induced chronic colitis.

Our data showed that aIL-10R mAb-treated BALBc Lcn2KO mice exhibited severe chronic colitis i.e.

Analysis of standard colitis parameters Pennsylvania USAData accessibilityData are provided with this articleValue of the dataThe data are valuable to researchers interested in investigating the role of lipocalin 2 Lcn2 in inflammatory bowel disease.The data indicate that Lcn2 deficiency predisposes to colitis and this phenotype can be recapitu- lated in mice on the BALBc background.The data support future studies in delineating the role of Lcn2 in conferring mucoprotection.DataThe dataset of this article provides additional information to Ref.

in which we have char- acterized the increased susceptibility of C57BL6 lipocalin 2 knockout Lcn2KO mice to colitis.

immune responses of C57BL6 and BALBc mice are Th1 and Th2-biased respectively - we herein investigated the susceptibility of BALBc Lcn2KO mice to interleukin-10 receptor IL-10R neutralization-induced chronic colitis.
