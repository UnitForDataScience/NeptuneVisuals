The contents of arabinose xylose and glucose in FCB were increased 50 39 and 23 respectively.TABLE 1  Composition of corn bran CB and fermented CB FCB gkg DM basis1.ItemsCBFCB1 SDF soluble dietary fiber IDF insoluble dietary fiber NSP non-starch polysaccharides.Growth Performance and Nutrient DigestibilityThere were no differences in ADFI ADG and FCR among the dietary treatments Table 2 which indicated that there are no effect on growth performance when treated by dietary CB and FCB.

In addition pigs fed CON diet 2.24 had higher abundance of RikenellaceaeRC9gutgroup compared to CB 1.61 and FCB 1.17 treatments P  0.05.SCFAs in Fecal SamplesLactic acid was not detected in the majority of fecal samples and the SCFAs including acetate priopinate isobutyrate butyrate isovalerate and valerate were not affected by the CB or FCB dietary treatments Table 4 which suggested that SCFAs themicrobial metabolites may not mediate the effects of dietary CB or FCB.DISCUSSIONThis study was performed to compare the effect of CB and FCB inclusion on growth performance nutrient digestibility and gut microbiota composition in finishing pigs.

The studydetected Fibrobacteres phylum which is associated with cellulolytic bacteria and there was no difference between treatments where relative abundance in CON CB and FCB groups was 0.04 0.13 and 0.09 respectively SupplementalTABLE 2  Effects of dietary corn bran CB and fermented CB FCB on growth performance of finishing pigs1.

A total of 60 finishing pigs were allocated to 3 dietary treatments consisting of a control CON diet a 10 CB diet and a 10 fermented CB FCB diet in a 21 d feeding trial.

CON control group ADFI average daily feed intake ADG average daily gain FCR feed conversion ratio.TABLE 3  Effect of dietary corn bran CB and fermented CB FCB on nutrient digestibility of finishing pigs1.1 Fecal samples from 1 pig per pen n  5 pigs per treatment performed for nutrient digestibility in a 21 d feeding trial.

Addition to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum there were 13 other phylum detectedTABLE 4  Effect of dietary corn bran CB and fermented CB FCB on short-chain fatty acids concentrations in feces of finishing pigs1.1 Fecal samples from at least 1 pig per pen n  7 pigs per treatment were performed for SCFAs analysis in a 21 d feeding trial data were presented as mean values - SEMs.

Samples of CB and FCB were collected for chemical analysis including starch crude protein cellulose hemicellulose lignin soluble dietary fiber insoluble dietary fiber and non-starch polysaccharide.Animals Diet Treatments and SamplingFinishing pigs n  60 Duroc x Landrance x Yorkshire 135 - 1 d age 65.73 - 0.7 kg body weight were allocated randomly to 3 groups balancing for litter and gender.

There was no effect of dietary treatment on digestibility of other measured nutrients.Bacterial Community Richness and BiodiversityThere were 818 817 and 787 operational taxonomic units OTUs obtained from pigs fed CON CB and FCB dietary treatments respectively of which 764 were common OTUs among 3 experimental groups Figure 1A.

The a-diversity index of Chao 1 in the FCB group was lower compared to the CON group P  0.05 and the Shannon index was not affected by dietary treatments Figures 1BC.Fifteen distinct phylum were identified in feces of finishing pigs fed different CB supplementations Supplemental Table 2 where Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes accounted for94 within all dietary treatments Figure 2A.

In conclusion dietary FCB decreased the abundance of bacterial communities particularly the population of bacteria related to cellulolytic degradation.Keywords Bacillus subtilis cellulolytic bacteria corn bran dietary fiber fermentation gut microbiotaINTRODUCTIONThe consumption of dietary fiber plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis of the gut ecosystem.
