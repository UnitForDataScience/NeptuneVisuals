Despite the importance of the microbe- host relationship in the pathogenesis and progression of infectious diseases these approaches have not been applied to define the lung microbiome in patients with bronchiectasis.The aim of this study therefore was to characterize differentiate and compare the compo- sition of lower airway bacterial microbiome between clinically stable patients with bronchiec- tasis and acutely infected patients with bronchiectasis experiencing an exacerbation using culture-independent DNA-based molecular techniques.

Alpha diversity with richness Simpson's and Shannon indices and beta diversity using principal coordinate analysis revealed no significant differences in lung microbiome between patients with clinically stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.ConclusionCulture-based microbiological and molecular-based techniques did not reveal significant dif- ferences in the lung microbiome of patients who were clinically stable and those experienc- ing exacerbated bronchiectasis.

Beta-diversity was visualized using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis.ResultsDemographics of patients with stable and acutely exacerbated bronchiectasisA total of 17 patients were enrolled in this study 9 had clinically stable bronchiectasis and 8 had acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis.

Comparing bacterial diversity and abundance between patients with stable and acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis may lead to improved understanding of the clinical significance of acute exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis.

In the DNA sequencing process one BAL sample was excluded because the DNA was not sufficiently extracted two BAL samples were excluded because the total number of reads was too low.Finally 14 BAL samples were included in the analysis 8 samples were obtained from patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis and 6 were collected from patients with acutely exacer- bated bronchiectasis.

In the alpha diversity analysis microbial community diversity in patients with stable bronchiectasis suggested a tendency toward more diverse genera than that in patients with exacerbated bronchiectasis although without significant differences.

Using culture-independent DNA-based molecular techniques the aim of the present study was to characterize differentiate and compare the composition of lower airway bacterial microbiome between clinically stable and acutely infected patients with bronchiectasis experiencing exacerbation.MethodsPatients with clinically stable bronchiectasis and those experiencing acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis were recruited.
