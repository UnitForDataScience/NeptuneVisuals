All rights reserved.organics such as methanol ethanol and acetate are often added to ensure efficient heterotrophic denitrification and may increase the cost and risk of organic residue contamination  .Autotrophic denitrification in which denitrifying bacteria rely on inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen ferrous iron or reduced sulfur compounds and use inorganics carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as carbon sources has recently been recognized as an alternative to heterotrophic denitrification and has attracted much attention .

The designation ''13C-nirS-clone-1 3650 indicates that in a total of 50 nirS gene clones 36 showed 97 sequence similarity with clone-1 in the 13C-labeled DNA fraction.of Thiobacillus-like bacteria in the ''heavy DNA fraction was much higher than that of the other bacteria indicating that Thiobacillus- like bacteria were the most important autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the reactors.Clone libraries and phylogenetic analysisClone libraries and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA In the phylogenetic tree of bacterial 16S rRNA  the clus- ter associated with Thiobacillus contained 66.7 2030 of clones from the 13C-labeled ''heavy DNA fraction.

Moreover it can accomplish simultane- ous ammonia and nitrate removal when applied under micro- aerobic conditions .Although many studies on autotrophic denitrification process have been carried out more in-depth analyses of autotrophic den- itrifying bacteria are required to elucidate the microbial mecha- nisms of nitrate removal under autotrophic conditions and further develop successful and stable autotrophic denitrification processes.

Notably denitrifying bacteria exhibit high diversity based on biochemical and taxonomical perspectives  thus identification of the autotrophic functions of bacteria during denitrification through taxonomical analysis is difficult.DNA-based stable-isotope probing DNA-SIP provides a cultivation-independent means to link bacterial identity with func- tion in the environment .

These results were consistent with high-throughput sequencing data and further confirmed that Thiobacillus-like bacteria were the most dominant bacteria assimilating the 13C-labeled inorganic carbon source during autotrophic denitrification.

However neither elemental sulfur nor sulfur compounds were added into the influent or micro-electrolysis carriers used in autotrophic denitrification reactors in this study indicating that autotrophic denitrification achieved by Thiobacillus-like bacteria could also rely on other inorganic electron donors rather than sul- fur or sulfur compounds.

Since 16S rRNA has been widely used to classify uncultured bacteria owing to the high conservation of this gene throughout evolution it could be concluded that the domi- nant bacteria in the 13C-labeled ''heavy DNA were Thiobacillus- like bacteria according to both high-throughput sequencing and clone library analysis.
