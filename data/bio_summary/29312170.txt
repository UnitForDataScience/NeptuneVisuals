More isolates were derived from tissueprotoplasts compared to algal growth medium p 1.92E- 13 suggesting a close association between Ectocarpus and the Halomonas sp.In summary each cultivation strategy resulted in the cultivation of unique strains that were not cultivated with any of the other methods.

Each cultivation strategy resulted in another dominant genus or weed-species Bosea for antibiotic- treated algae Limnobacter for dilution-to-extinction cultivation and each strategy also led to the cultivation of unique isolates that were not found with any other cultivation method.

The most abundant phylum among the cultivable isolates was Proteobacteria with 89 of all isolates and 26 unique strains belonging to this group.

were two protoplast- specific strains obtained using DP but they were only isolated once in the experiment.Dilution-to-extinction cultivation DTEOne hundred and fifty isolates were identified and 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed eight unique strains.

An overview of the isolation methods and cultivation strategies is provided in .Isolation of Bacteria from Algae with Their Full Microbial FloraDirect plating techniquesTo isolate bacteria algal growth media ground algal tissue and algal protoplast digest product of EC371 grown in DNSW or NSW were directly plated DP on eight different growth media solidified with 1.5 agar.

In both cases plates were incubated until single colonies were visible 3-20 days and the latter identified with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing as described below.Antibiotic-treatments of algal tissue and growth media Antibiotics were used to reduce the abundance of dominant bacterial strains from the algal tissue andor growth media in our case especially Halomonas sp.
