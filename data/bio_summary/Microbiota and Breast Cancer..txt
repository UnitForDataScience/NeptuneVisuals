There is potential for alterations in the composition of the breast microbiota via the intestines--for example oral lactobacilli administered to patients with mastitis has been isolated from the breast tissue and correlated with abrogation of inflammation in the breast.Indeed postmenopausal women with breast cancer have lower a-diversity but higher b-diversity which seemed to be estrogen independent.One view of how gut bacteria alter mammary tumor response is likely via alteration of neutrophil-associated inflammatory responses in the intestine and distal sites.Indeed compiling the studies one can posit that estrogen-independent breast cancer-related conditions such as adiposity insulin resistance dyslipidemia metabolic syndrome leukocytosis and elevated level of C-reactive protein might well be independent predictors of microbiota-contributed factors toward breast carcinogenesis.Further indication of a microbial association with breast cancer comes from a breast cancer staging study in which patients with grade III cancer had a borderline significance higher absolute count of Blautia sp.

Finally some prelim- inary conclusions of the important contributions and pathways of specific bacteria to breast carcinogenesis andor cancer will be presented.Breast cancer evolves as a complex interaction between genes and environment yet under the perfect conditions of uncommon genetic muta- tions and environmental exposure only a fraction of cases develop as cancer.

quorum sensing peptides .Breast cancer produces an overwhelming health burden--there are 232670 new breast cancer cases and 40000 deaths among women living with breast cancer in the United States in 2014.These staggering statistics linger despite optimal therapies available to women in this decade.

Interestingly the bacteria from breast cancer patients all shared a common enzyme expressed b-glucuronidase.Interestingly quorum- sensing molecules present within the milieu of biofilms in breast tissue have been associated with changes in function of neutrophils macrophagesendothelialand epithelial cells.As an extension of these observations Human Papilloma Virus also correlates with stat3 signaling and IL17 expres- sion in breast cancer tissue.Microbial dysbiosis seems to be a hallmark of human breast cancer.

There are many nonmodifiable risk factors for breast cancer age BRCA mutations family and reproductive history and high-dose radiation to the chest however of the modifiable forms high-endogenous estrogens hor- mone therapy obesity and alcohol consumption there is a common theme that relates to endogenous estrogen balance and its subsequent effect on breast tissues estrogen receptor expressioninteractions.It has been unequivocally established that endogenous estrogen burden is associated with breast cancer development in postmenopausal women.There is a similar association in premenopausal women however this has not been firmly established due to the small studies and greater variation in hormone levels due to the menstrual cycle.Given the strong positive associationBacterial components Secretion moleculesXenobiotic endobiotic metabolismOropharynxGI tractFig.

Furthermore our approach will specifically probe and answer the speculation that microbial BGUS enzymes are important regulators of the estrabolome and breast cancer risk .The study of breast cancer prevention is best achieved in multistep models of breast carcinogenesis.

In circulation the various conjugated and unconjugated estrogensmetabolites have differential effects on estrogen-receptor positive ER breast cancer growth and development.the early occurrence of tumors allows for rapid assessment of chemoprevention and that the early lesions are significantly dependent on estrogen receptor signaling.This model has been extensively characterized for probing tumor biology as it relates to both rodent and human breast cancer as well as experimental therapies.From the perspective of this application in which the estrogen burden effects are being evaluated the PyMT mouse is tractable and has excellent breeding potential short latency to tumor development and estrogen-receptor positive ER-associated early lesions.

tTATagERa mice are more cumbersome and involve use of antibiotics like tetracycline that in our experimental design would pose problems with data interpretation in the control arm.Non-GEM models would not provide us with the opportunity to study the multistep progression of malig- nancy and early cancer intervention effects.The positive correlation between bioactive estrogen and breast cancer development in postmenopausal women is now well established.

These and related concepts in breast cancer are being tested at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Bronx NYunder the sponsorship of the United States Department of Defense.Bacteria are abundantly present in breast cancer tissue.

A more recent paper suggests that there is indeed a good correlation between breast cancer with enrichment of taxa of lower abundance that include genera Fusobacterium Atopobium Gluconacetobacter Hydrogenophaga and Lactobacillus.In another paper in women with breast cancer there was a higher relative abundance of Bacillus Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus.
