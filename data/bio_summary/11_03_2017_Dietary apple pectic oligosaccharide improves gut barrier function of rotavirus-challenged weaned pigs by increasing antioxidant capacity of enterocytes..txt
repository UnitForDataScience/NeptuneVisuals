Additionally in the piglets challenged by RV supplementing APOS in diets could alleviate the effect of RV infusion on populations of Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium and E. coli pH value and concentrations of acetate and total VFA in cecal digesta P  0.05 Table 4.Table 2 The effect of dietary APOS supplementation andor RV challenge on the intestinal morphology in the jejunum of weaned pigs n7 RV - infusing the essential medium RV  infusing the porcine rotavirus CON basal diet POS POS-supplemented diet.A B In the same row values with different letter superscripts mean significant difference P0.05.Glucagon like peptide-2 GLP-2 level and antioxidant capacity in jejunal mucosaVia RV challenge GLP-2 concentration of jejunal mucosa was reduced P  0.05 and total antioxidant capacity T-AOC of jejunal mucosa was inhibited P 0.05 but malondialdehyde MDA concentration of jejunal mucosa was increased P  0.05 in weaned pigs Table 5.

However dietary APOS supplementation could significantly attenuate diarrhea and decrease NSP4 concentration of jejunal mucosa in weaned pigs challenged by RV P 0.05 Table 1.Histology of jejunal mucosaFollowing RV challenge villus height and villus heightcrypt depth were decreased in jejunal mucosa of weaned pigs P  0.05 Table 2 and Figure 1.

Moreover in weaned pigs infected by RV dietary APOS supplementation couldalleviate the effect of RV challenge on villus height and villus heightcrypt depth of jejunal mucosa P  0.05 Table 2 and Figure 1.Expressions of tight junction proteins and concentrations of mucins in jejunal mucosaRV infection decreased expressions of zonula occludens 1 ZO-1 occludin claudin 1 and claudin 3 and concentrations of mucin 1 and mucin 2 in jejunal mucosa of weaned pigs P  0.05 Table 3 and Figure 2.

The possible mechanism was also studied.RESULTSDiarrhea and non-structural protein 4 NSP4 concentration of jejunal mucosaFollowing RV infection average diarrhea index and NSP4 concentration of jejunal mucosa was increased in weaned pigs P  0.05 Table 1.

The results also showed that in the pigs challenged by RV dietary APOS supplementation could improve the effect of RV infection on T-AOC and MDA levels in jejunal mucosa P  0.05 Table 5.Levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress ERS- autophagy- and apoptosis-relative proteins in jejunal mucosaFor determining the possible effect of ERS autophagy and apoptosis the levels of some proteins in these pathways such as phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin p-mTOR Ser2448 mTOR Beclin 1 CCAATenhancer-binding protein homologous protein CHOP B-cell lymphomaleukaemia-2- associated X protein Bax and B-cell lymphomaleukaemia-2 Bcl-2 were analyzed by Western Blot.

The results of our study showed that APOS administration improved jejunal mucosal morphology and enhanced expressions of ZO-1 occludin claudin 1 and claudin 3 and concentrations of mucin 1 and mucin 2 of jejunal mucosa in weaned pigs infected by RV Tables 2-3 and Figure 1- 2 which illustrated that dietary APOS supplementation alleviating the RV infection could also be relative with the improvement of mucosal-epithelial integrity intercellular junctions between the epithelial cells and mucus gel layer.
