the results demonstrated that the copy numbers of the resistance genes grya parc aac6'-ib-cr and qrns did not increase in the soil in treatment c with cip added directly into the soil yet cip did cause a small amount of divergence when added the manure into the soil.

three different methods of adding ciprofloxacin cip a common antibiotic used in the swine industry to the soil were used to investigate the effects of cip on the soil microbiome and the degradation of cip.

results of the study showed that the microbiome could promote the degradation of cip in the soil when cip was incorporated into the soil together with manure.

ad- ditionally the massive use of ciprofloxacin has also resulted in the wide- spread occurrence in different human habitats .cip is difficult to degrade in the environment especially in the soil in which it is combined with soil particles due to their physicochemical properties and mineralogy .

in addition the application of 100 mgkg-1 cip could stimulate soil basal respirations and inhibit the soil microbiome metabolism .

therefore in the present study three different methods of cip addition were tested to confirm their ecotoxico- logical effects a adding the manure of swine supplied with diets includ- ing cip to the soil b cip was added to antibiotic-free feces andc adding cip directly into the soil.

the three addition methods were a adding the ma- nure of swine supplied with diets including cip to the soil b cip was added to antibiotic-free feces and c adding cip directly into the soil.

through taking 100 g from mixed soil using the quartering method the remaining soil was put back to the experimental container.

based on these results cip added into the soil increased the awcd values and had a positive effect on the soil microbial function under the three treat- ments especially cip addition together with manure.the pca of the biolog eco-plate result demonstrated distinct carbon metabolism under different treatments and use of 31 carbon sources .

directly adding antibiotics to the soil is the main method to confirm the effect of the antibiotic on the microbial structure and function in the soil .

our studies provided the novelty results for verifying the effect of different cip addition methods on the degradation of cip in the soil and determining the microbiome function on the cip degradation in different addition methods.to examine the role of ciprofloxacin degradation by the microbiome in the soil we used 0.1 nan3 to inhibit the activity of the microbiome.
