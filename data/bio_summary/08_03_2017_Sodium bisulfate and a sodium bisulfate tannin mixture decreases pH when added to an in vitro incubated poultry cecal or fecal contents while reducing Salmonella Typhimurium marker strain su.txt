M. RUBINELLI ET AL.In the present study we investigated the ability of SBS and a mixture of SBStannin to inhibit S. Typhimurium in a con- trolled in vitro anerobic mixed cecal and fecal culture described previously that mimics the environment within the chicken ceca to determine if developmental timing of cecal microbiota and prior adaptation of cecal microbiota to SBS and SBStannin mixture could impact Salmonella survival.Materials and methodsBacterial strainSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium marker strain ST97 used in the present study is a nalidixic acid-resistant NAR strain NVSL Ames IA USA.

For example for a final concentration of 0.25 SBS in a culture the SBS was mixed with chicken feed to a stock concentration of 25 ww and subsequently added to ADS as 0.20 g in 20 mL of ADS to bring the final concentration of the SBS to 0.25 wv.Fecal and cecal samplesA University of Arkansas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC-approved protocol was used to ensure humane treatment of the chickens that served as sources of cecal contents.

In the unadapted incubation S. Typhimurium was added at the begin- ning of the culture incubation along with cecal bacteria and chicken feedSBS or chicken feedSBStannin to simulate expo- sure to S. Typhimurium prior to anerobic metabolic activity by the cecal microbiota.

For the adapted incubation S. Typhimu- rium was added after a 24 h pre-incubation of the cecal bacteria with the chicken feedSBS or chicken feedSBStannin to simu- late exposure to Salmonella after cecal bacteria are metabolically active under anaerobic conditions.

Three control incubations containing either feed only cecal content only or feed cecal contents were run in parallel as indicated in .Enumeration of SalmonellaAn aliquot 1 mL of each culture from 0 24 and 48 h was seri- ally diluted 10-fold with sterile phosphate buffered saline.

The population of S. Typhimurium was maintained or increased in controls feed only cecal only and feed cecal control without SBS or SBStannin mixture while treatment groups containing higher concentrations of SBS or SBStannin exhibited distinctive antimicrobial activities  and .

Overall samples containing cecal and fecal contents exhibited different patterns of microbial composition and it is possible that fecal materials represented a limited recovery of certain groups of bacteria.When the respective bacterial compositions of an anaerobic mixed culture using either cecal or fecal contents were com- pared they yielded somewhat different patterns at the phylum level .

Fecal control samples contained greater levels of Pro- teobacteria and Cyanobacteria 7.40 and 5.30 respectively compared to cecal control samples 1.70 and 1.00 respectively.In the SBS containing incubations initial samples 0 h cecal only controls were dominated by Firmicutes 97.10 Proteo- bacteria 1.70 Cyanobacteria 1.00 and Actinobacteria 0.20.
