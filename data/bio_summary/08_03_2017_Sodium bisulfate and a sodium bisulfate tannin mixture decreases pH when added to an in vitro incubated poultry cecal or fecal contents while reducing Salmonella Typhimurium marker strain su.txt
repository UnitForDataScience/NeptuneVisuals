m. rubinelli et al.in the present study we investigated the ability of sbs and a mixture of sbstannin to inhibit s. typhimurium in a con- trolled in vitro anerobic mixed cecal and fecal culture described previously that mimics the environment within the chicken ceca to determine if developmental timing of cecal microbiota and prior adaptation of cecal microbiota to sbs and sbstannin mixture could impact salmonella survival.materials and methodsbacterial strainsalmonella enterica serovar typhimurium marker strain st97 used in the present study is a nalidixic acid-resistant nar strain nvsl ames ia usa.

only 1.0 sbstannin treatment resulted in considerable s. typhimurium reduction while there was no reduction at the other concentrations 0.25 and 0.75. the population of s. typhimurium was reduced to undetect- able levels and 2.0 log cfuml after 24 and 48 h respectively a slight increase of s. typhimurium populations was observed at 48 h.survival of s. typhimurium in the adapted condition pre- incubation of cecal contents with sbs alone and sbstannin mixture are shown in and  respectively.

fecal control samples contained greater levels of pro- teobacteria and cyanobacteria 7.40 and 5.30 respectively compared to cecal control samples 1.70 and 1.00 respectively.in the sbs containing incubations initial samples 0 h cecal only controls were dominated by firmicutes 97.10 proteo- bacteria 1.70 cyanobacteria 1.00 and actinobacteria 0.20. when sbs was added to the cecal contents the relative abundance level of firmicutes was decreased to 89.80 while the proportions of proteobacteria and cyanobacteria were increased to 7.00 and 2.53 compared to the cecal only controlsamples respectively.

in the unadapted incubation s. typhimurium was added at the begin- ning of the culture incubation along with cecal bacteria and chicken feedsbs or chicken feedsbstannin to simulate expo- sure to s. typhimurium prior to anerobic metabolic activity by the cecal microbiota.

perhaps a more protected or encapsulated form of sbs would reach the ceca in birds and cause compositional changes more in agreement with the in vitro results.salmonella reduction by sbs in cecal and fecal contents originating from chickens at different ageswe hypothesized that sbs might reduce s. typhimurium regardless of age of the chicken and also wanted to investigate if reduction of s. typhimurium would be comparable in both cecal contents and feces because of the potential application of sbs to animal litter as a pre-harvest control measure.

the 0.1 g of cecal contents were added to 300 ml ads 13000. a 20 ml aliquot of this diluted cecal content was transferred to each ster- ile bottle with or without chicken feed and sbs 0.25 0.5 0.75 or sbstannin mixture 0.25 0.5 and 1.0. two additional cul- tures one each for the unadapted and adapted conditions received sterile ads but no cecal content.

the population of s. typhimurium was maintained or increased in controls feed only cecal only and feed cecal control without sbs or sbstannin mixture while treatment groups containing higher concentrations of sbs or sbstannin exhibited distinctive antimicrobial activities  and .

if no s. typhimurium were detected at a particular timepoint in undiluted culture that culture was inoculated into tt enrichment broth and subsequently plated on bg na agar to confirm that no s. typhimurium survived.microbiome analysismicrobiome sequencing was performed with controls cecal contents of 2 week-old chicken only and fecal of 2 week-oldjournal of environmental science and health part b609figure 1. experimental design used in the present study.

the adapted cul- ture with 0.5 sbs also rapidly killed s. typhimurium to below the detection limit by 24 and 48 h. pure 0.25 sbs reduced s. typhimurium 1.48 logs by 24 h. at 48 h 0.25 sbs exhibited a 2.82 log reduction.figure 3. survival of salmonella typhimurium during incubation time in unadapted cultures with various concentrations 0.25 0.5 and 1 of sodium bisulfate sbs and tannin mixture.

for example for a final concentration of 0.25 sbs in a culture the sbs was mixed with chicken feed to a stock concentration of 25 ww and subsequently added to ads as 0.20 g in 20 ml of ads to bring the final concentration of the sbs to 0.25 wv.fecal and cecal samplesa university of arkansas institutional animal care and use committee iacuc-approved protocol was used to ensure humane treatment of the chickens that served as sources of cecal contents.

for the adapted incubation s. typhimu- rium was added after a 24 h pre-incubation of the cecal bacteria with the chicken feedsbs or chicken feedsbstannin to simu- late exposure to salmonella after cecal bacteria are metabolically active under anaerobic conditions.

three control incubations containing either feed only cecal content only or feed cecal contents were run in parallel as indicated in .enumeration of salmonellaan aliquot 1 ml of each culture from 0 24 and 48 h was seri- ally diluted 10-fold with sterile phosphate buffered saline.

overall samples containing cecal and fecal contents exhibited different patterns of microbial composition and it is possible that fecal materials represented a limited recovery of certain groups of bacteria.when the respective bacterial compositions of an anaerobic mixed culture using either cecal or fecal contents were com- pared they yielded somewhat different patterns at the phylum level .
