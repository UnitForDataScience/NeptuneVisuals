This transient interaction stimulates the phosphorylation of KaiC or inhibits dephosphory- lation thereby shifting the reaction towards phosphory- lation575863 and when S431 of KaiC achieves the T432 pS431 state in the phosphorylation sequence KaiB binds to KaiC.

In addition to displacing SasA from CI of KaiC KaiB forms a complex with CI domains that also stably sequesters and inactivates KaiA so that KaiA can no longer stimulate the phosphoryla- tion of KaiC and KaiC switches to its autophosphatase mode18414770 FIG.

There is even evidence for a highly damped oscillation of the ATPase activity of KaiC in the absence of KaiA and KaiB19.However is the ATPase hypothesis as the core pacemaker just an 'infinite regress' with another pro- cess underlying the slow rate Given that many ATP- hydrolysing reactions have very fast rates can we explain the sedate tempo of the KaiC ATPase A structural study identified features in the CI domain of KaiC that might explain its slow ATPase activity19.

Moreover an analysis of KaiC mutants in vivo and in vitro showed a strict correlation between the ATPase activity of KaiC and circadian frequency which implies that the circadian period depends directly on the energy that is providedby ATP hydrolysis1945.

First a KaiC hexamer can exchange monomeric subunits with neighbouring hexamers596076 and this monomer exchange maintains synchrony of the phosphorylation status among the KaiC hexamers in the population6075.

Therefore KaiC mono- mer exchange and KaiA sequestration ensure that KaiC hexamers remain synchronized in the PTO.The sun also rises for other bacteriaIn cyanobacteria all three Kai proteins are required for circadian oscillations in vivo and in vitro3839.

exhibit light-dark-entrained daily transcription but not sustained oscillations under constant conditions83.Does this mean that all three Kai proteins are required for self-sustained circadian oscillations or is it possible that a circadian clock could be composed of KaiB and KaiC or even just KaiC aloneIn this context the example of purple bacteria may be instructive.

The post-translational oscillator PTO is composed of rhythmic associations between KaiC purple KaiA blue and KaiB green or black to form a nanocomplex that regulates the ATPase and phosphorylation activities of KaiC.

KaiA associates with hypophosphorylated KaiC and stimulates the autophos- phorylation of KaiC red circles indicate the added phosphates which accelerates the rate of ATP hydrolysis.
