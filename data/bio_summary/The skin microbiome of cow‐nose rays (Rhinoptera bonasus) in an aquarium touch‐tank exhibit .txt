if these human associated microbes were present we would not be able to substantiate based on this experimental design that it was specifically due to human interaction with the animals howeverthe absence of human associated microbes on the rays on exhibit would suggest that human contact is not transmitting human associated bacteria to the skin of the rays.

we did not observe a signal of human derived bacteria in the microbiome of the rays on exhibit suggesting that human to ray transfer of microbes in this exhibit at the time of sampling appears to be small.

although a formal test for the presence of human-derived microbes on the ray skin would require a control group of rays that were not part of a touch-tank exhibit we can nonetheless screen the sequences derived here to determine whether there is the presence of a large degree of sequences typically found in human skin microbiomes.
