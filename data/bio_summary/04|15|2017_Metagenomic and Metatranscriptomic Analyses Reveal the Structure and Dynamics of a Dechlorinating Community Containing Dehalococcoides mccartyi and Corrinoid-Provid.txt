Here RT-qPCR using specific primers targeting corrinoid synthesis genes identified from the Veillonellaceae bin-genome as well as Dehalococcoides microarrays seemed to be more sensitive in detecting the differential gene expression than metatranscriptomic sequencing by avoid- ing the interference of structural RNAs and mRNAs of housekeeping genes.

Although similar numbers of transcripts were detected in the two metatranscriptomes  approximately 550 functional genes exhibited more than 5-fold greater transcript abundance in HiTCE than in HiTCEB12 .FIG 3 Taxonomic distribution of the upregulated genes in HiTCE 5-fold difference based on meta- transcriptomic analysis over a time course.Moreover about 75 of those upregulated genes were assigned to the Veillonellaceae bin-genome .

The findings shed light on the important roles ofApril 2017 Volume 83 Issue 8 e03508-16Applied and Environmental Microbiology 1Veillonellaceae species in the communities compared to other coexisting community members in producing and providing corrinoids for Dehalococcoides species under cobalamin-limited conditions.KEYWORDS Dehalococcoides reductive dechlorination corrinoid Veillonellaceae metagenome metatranscriptomehlorinated solvents such as tetra- and trichloroethene PCE and TCE respec- tively are common groundwater contaminants in the United States  .

However only the Dehalococcoides btuD gene geneid5163 transcript was detected in the metatranscriptomes with about 2 times more abundance in the enrichment without exogenous cobalamin than that with exogenous cobalamin Table S4.Sporulation-related genes in the Veillonellaceae bin-genome.

In addition the transcripts of cobalt ABC transporters were detected only at T1 indicating that corrinoid biosynthesis occurred at an early phase and its activity decreased afterwards when corrinoids reached an adequate level.FIG 6 Relative gene expression ratios HiTCEHiTCEB12 at T1 by RT-qPCR targeting corrinoid biosyn- thesis genes in the Veillonellaceae bin-genome red lines indicate 2-fold difference reference gene tceA representing dechlorination activity.We also analyzed the presence and transcriptional activities of the corrinoid ABC transporter operon btuFCD in all bin-genomes.

The cDNA was then relatively quantified by qPCR using Fast SYBR green PCR reagent Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Grand Island NY according to the manufacturer's instructions.The relative gene expression ratio was calculated using equation 1R  2DCTHiTCEref - target - DCTHiTCEB12ref - target  2DDCT1where DCTHiTCEref - target and DCTHiTCEB12ref - target are the differences in threshold cycle CT values of a reference gene and the targeted corrinoid-related gene in the HiTCE and HiTCEB12 samples respectively.

In the Veillonellaceae bin-genome the transcripts of the two genes encoding the corrinoid-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methylmalonyl-CoA carboxyltransferase were less abundant in HiTCE than in HiTCEB12 whereas the other genes in this pathway exhibited higher expression in HiTCE especially for lactate permease.

Although the other two Firmicutes bin-genomes those of Sedimentibacter and Clostridium also possess a suite of sporulation-related genes the sporulation activities were insignificant with only 2 to 4 genes actively transcribed Tables S4 and S5.Complementary molecular approaches for differential gene expression analy- ses.

To further validate the metatranscriptomic sequencing results related to the Dehalococcoides bin-genome we compared differential gene expression obtained from a Dehalococcoides genus-wide microarray to that obtained from the metatranscrip- tomic sequencing.
