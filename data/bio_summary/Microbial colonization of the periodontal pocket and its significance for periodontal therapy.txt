Does adjunctive antimicrobial therapy reduce the perceived need for peri- odontal surgery Periodontol 2000 2011 55 205-216.Mombelli A Cionca N Almaghlouth A Decaillet F Cour- voisier DS Giannopoulou C. Are there specific benefits of amoxicillin plus metronidazole in Aggregatibacter actino- mycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis Double- masked randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety.
