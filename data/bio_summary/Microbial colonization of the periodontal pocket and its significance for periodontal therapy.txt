A. actinomycetemcomitans and Porphy- romonas gingivalis have been suspected to be of par- ticular importance in the disease process as a result of their pathogenic potential demonstrated in animal models and an association with disease progression and clinical response to therapy as found in prospec- tive and retrospective clinical trials 7 11 13 17 3740 41 85 115.

In patients with aggressive periodontitis the systemic administration of amoxi- cillin and metronidazole resulted in significantly better results than treatment with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy 2.Treatment outcomes of scaling and root planing in combination with systemic antibiotics local antibi- otic therapy andor periodontal surgery were com- pared over 24 months in a randomized clinical trial 35.

A longitudinal study showed a limited potential of microbiological tests performed after nonsurgical therapy to predict the clinical outcome 6 months later but confirmed the importance of good oral hygiene before nonsurgical therapy in patients still showing multiple sites with visible plaque after the hygiene phase there was an increased tendency for bleeding on probing 6 months after scaling and root planing 8.

After ultrasonic debridement residual pockets with pocket depth 4 mm clinical attachment loss  2 mm and bleed- ing upon probing were randomly assigned to photo- dynamic therapy delivered twice within 1 week group A photodynamic therapy delivered only once group B or sham treatment without activating the laser group C. Methylene blue was applied with a blunt irrigator tip into the pockets.

However the evidence for an advantage of bacteriology-assisted clinical protocols is unsatisfactory.Microbial recolonization after therapyRepeated microbiological sampling in treated sites has shown that over time a microbiota similar to that present before therapy may re-emerge.

We compared thorough scaling and root planing with short ultrasonic mechanical debridement followed by antimicrobial photody- namic therapy to assess their effects in residual pock- ets in a clinical trial 9 31.
