hence further understanding of the clinical benefits with sbi therapy is required while exploring the puta- tive mechanisms of action of sbi the goal of this study.in patients with ibs-d following recurrent c.difficile infection sbi restored normal bowel function in two patients treated in open-label fashion crawford and panas 2015 suggesting potential effects on barrier function mucosal immune function or conceivably the microbiome but clearly requiring more rigorous study.in a single-center retrospective chart review of 45 patients with inflammatory bowel disease 38 crohn's disease and 7 ulcerative colitis with limited to no response to traditional pharmaceutical therapies the medical food sbi has been shown to improve symptom scores and clinical management shafran et al.

2016. there was a numerical reduction in excre- tion proportion excreted 0.465 - 0.256 sd at baseline compared to 0.301 - 0.05 on sbi p  0.173 which was not statistically significant.tryptophan metabolismtherapy with sbi for 8 weeks caused no significant change in the kynurenine to tryptophan kt ratio table 3. the kt ratio at baseline and after treatment was 0.031 and 0.032 respectively p  0.353. interestingly there was a borderline reduction in tryptophan from 10.95 lgml to10.49 lgml p  0.133 after sbi therapy.mrna expression of pivotal genes in duodenal mucosato evaluate the impact of sbi therapy on gene expression in the mucosa of the small intestine in patients with ibs- d we quantified changes from baseline in the expression of 90 candidate genes table 4. all candidate genes including those encoding tight junction proteins were related to immunity and inflammation and represent components of biological pathways involved in the patho- genesis of ibs-d. the mrna expression analysis of 90 candidate genes from duodenal mucosa was not signifi- cantly different after sbi therapy.

there was areduction in fasting serum c4 excretion 68.5 - 25.8 sd at baseline compared to 50.5 29.3 on sbi p  0.011. similarly the effect of sbi in four patients who had baseline fasting serum fgf-19  79 pgml showed an increase in fasting serum fgf-19 55.4 - 10.0 sd at baseline compared to 73.0 8.6 on sbi p  0.057.microbiome analysis of duodenal brushings and stoolthere were no significant effects of sbi therapy on a diversity of the microbiome in duodenal brushings or stool.

2016a.a number of studies have suggested a potential role for serum-derived bovine immunoglobulinprotein isolate sbi as a potential therapy for ibs-d. the potential mechanisms selected were based on several prior observa- tions that provide the rationale for this studysupport of gi mucosal barrier function with sbi which has been inferred in previous studies thatexamined anti-inflammatory effects or immune recon- stitution in response to sbi therapy in diverse condi- tions such as hiv enteropathy celiac disease and weight loss associated with cancer asmuth et al.

the 13c mannitol excretion and the lmr at baseline in the ibs-d patients did not differ from healthy controls table 3. there were no significant changes in small bowel or colonic perme- ability after sbi therapy for 8 weeks.we assessed the effect of sbi in six patients who had baseline 0-2 h excretion 0.228 proportion of adminis- tered dose based on published normal values grover et al.

during the 2-week screening period all participants had at least 2 daysweek with at least three bowel move- ments per day.clinical studiesbowel functiona detailed summary of changes in bowel function can be seen in table 1. the average number of stools per day decreased from 2.35 to 1.79 delta -0.56 p  0.001. average stool form as assessed by the bsfs 1-hard lumps to 7-watery decreased from 5.13 to 4.87 delta 0.26 p  0.07. average ease of passage decreased from 4.70 to4.45 delta -0.25 p  0.035. the proportion of incom- plete evacuation decreased as well from 0.37 to 0.30 delta -0.07 p  0.004 after 8 weeks of sbi therapy.

there was borderline alteration in fold expression of mrna of cldn4 and il4 genes 1.18 p  0.09 and 0.78 p  0.13 respectively.bile acid homeostasisserum fgf-19 114.6-113.5 p  0.923 and 7a c4 33.7- p  0.292 were not significantly altered from base- line after 8 weeks of sbi therapy table 3.we assessed the effect of sbi in four patients who had baseline fasting serum c4  49.1 ngml.

although no clear mechanistic evidence of sbi mitigating altered gut barrier permeability was found more detailed analyses using techniques such as electron microscopy are required to assess the histologic changes that might occur after ther- apy with sbi in ibs-d patients.

1979. sbi therapy does not seem to have a significant impact on bile acid homeostasis in patients with ibs-d.our studies of the microbiome suggest that sbi therapy was associated with numerical changes in proteobacteria burkholderiales and firmicutes catonella in duodenal brushings but there were no changes in stool micro- biome.

2015.however the mechanisms resulting in these improve- ments in bowel function in ibs-d are unclear even though open-label treatment in case series suggests thereis benefit when sbi is added to the patient's current stan- dard care in a clinical practice good et al.

2015.our aim was to evaluate the potential mechanisms of action in an open-label study of clinical safety and effec- tiveness of sbi in patients with ibs-d. the potential mechanisms underlying the activity were also explored including changes in epithelial barrier function for which the study power had sufficient power to detect a biologi- cally relevant change bile acid synthesis tryptophan metabolism and mucosal expression of pivotal genes in small bowel mucosa and duodenal and stool microbiota.

sample size was limited and based on a priori effect size calculations on a potentially achievable change in small bowel permeability 44 change from baseline on sbi therapy.
