Hence further understanding of the clinical benefits with SBI therapy is required while exploring the puta- tive mechanisms of action of SBI the goal of this study.In patients with IBS-D following recurrent C.difficile infection SBI restored normal bowel function in two patients treated in open-label fashion Crawford and Panas 2015 suggesting potential effects on barrier function mucosal immune function or conceivably the microbiome but clearly requiring more rigorous study.In a single-center retrospective chart review of 45 patients with inflammatory bowel disease 38 Crohn's disease and 7 ulcerative colitis with limited to no response to traditional pharmaceutical therapies the medical food SBI has been shown to improve symptom scores and clinical management Shafran et al.

Similarly the effect of SBI in four patients who had baseline fasting serum FGF-19  79 pgmL showed an increase in fasting serum FGF-19 55.4 - 10.0 SD at baseline compared to 73.0 8.6 on SBI P  0.057.Microbiome analysis of duodenal brushings and stoolThere were no significant effects of SBI therapy on a diversity of the microbiome in duodenal brushings or stool.

There were no significant changes in small bowel or colonic perme- ability after SBI therapy for 8 weeks.We assessed the effect of SBI in six patients who had baseline 0-2 h excretion 0.228 proportion of adminis- tered dose based on published normal values Grover et al.

These patients also did not have a significant reduction in small intestinal permeability.Conversely there were four patients with abnormal fasting serum C4 and four patients with abnormal fasting FGF-19 and significant or borderline differences in these measurements were observed with SBI administration.

The TEAEs reported included headache two patients cramping two patients nausea two patients gas two patients and one patient for each sores on tongue metallic taste in mouth back pain stomach flu bloating leaking sinus infection abdominal acid reflux cold sore and sick.The patient who experienced nausea mouth sores and a metallic taste in the mouth discontinued from the study without completing the study procedures.

Interestingly there was a borderline reduction in tryptophan from 10.95 lgmL to10.49 lgmL P  0.133 after SBI therapy.mRNA expression of pivotal genes in duodenal mucosaTo evaluate the impact of SBI therapy on gene expression in the mucosa of the small intestine in patients with IBS- D we quantified changes from baseline in the expression of 90 candidate genes Table 4.

There was borderline alteration in fold expression of mRNA of CLDN4 and IL4 genes 1.18 P  0.09 and 0.78 P  0.13 respectively.Bile acid homeostasisSerum FGF-19 114.6-113.5 P  0.923 and 7a C4 33.7- P  0.292 were not significantly altered from base- line after 8 weeks of SBI therapy Table 3.We assessed the effect of SBI in four patients who had baseline fasting serum C4  49.1 ngmL.

Although no clear mechanistic evidence of SBI mitigating altered gut barrier permeability was found more detailed analyses using techniques such as electron microscopy are required to assess the histologic changes that might occur after ther- apy with SBI in IBS-D patients.
