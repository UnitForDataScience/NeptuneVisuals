The biggest challenge in researching ARGs transfer in fish guts is to identify bacterial composition and abundance of the recipi- ents.Antibiotic resistance gene transfer between bacteria via conjugal transferable plasmids such as the RP4 plasmid is one of the most important mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer which commonly occurs by cell-to-cell conjunction Massoudieh Mathew Lambertini Nelson  Ginn 2007.

In this study we developed RP4 and RK2 plasmid-mediated ARG transfer models in zebrafish guts to investigate the spread of ARGs mediated by conju- gal transferable plasmids and to further confirm the hypothesis that the fish gut would be a suitable environment for conjugal gene transfer including those encoding antibiotic resistance.

To elucidate the antibiotic-resistant transfer dynamics in the different intestinal tracts of the zebrafish gut we detected ARBs and ARGs with differential abundances in different parts of the gut and we identified distinct phases of colonization of the gut associated with the beginning and cessation of feeding with donor bacteria.

The blank group zebrafish were fed with sterilized food without bacteria the negative control group zebrafish were fed with 108 cfud-fish K12Cm the experimental group zebrafish were fed with 108 cfud-fish K12CmRP4 Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com The species of transconjugants in zebrafish gut and faecesWe constructed the donor strain K12Td-TomatoRK2EGFP that expressed both red fluorescent protein encoded on the genome and green fluorescent protein encoded on the RK2 conjugal transfer plasmid.

The expressions of the two genes trbBp and trfAp genes which respectively adjusted mating pair formation as well as DNA transfer and replication were observed as being upregulated in the hindgut in comparison to other areas in the gut which demonstrated that the hindgut was the most efficient location for plasmid transfer.
