Many biologically active components are found in HM and there is some evidence arising from the studies in humans suggesting maternal exposures can change both HM composition and subsequent infant health outcomes -.Human Milk Immunological CompositionVariations in breast milk immune composition and the infant's response to HM immune constituents may also explain some of the conflicting results of studies evaluating whether prolonged exclusive breast-feeding can prevent allergic disease .

As these genera can be found in HM it is therefore plausible that their transfer to the infant during breastfeeding could provide immunological protection although more work is needed to confirm this link.The potential protective effect of HM bacteria against allergic diseases development has not been properly studied and future research should also investigate HM bacterial recognition by the immune system.

The possibility that interventions which modify maternal immunity can impact infant immune responses by changing HM composition is in part supported by associations between HM composition and immunological outcomes.Complexity and variability in human milk composition and known infant's response to many of HM constituents may also explain some of the conflicting results of studies evaluating the effect of prolonged exclusive breastfeeding and the prevention of allergic disease development.

In all the studies levels of sCD14 in HM were very high as this immune active molecule is amongst those immune factors actively excreted into HM.

The most promising HM components are TGF-b sCD14 and particularly their relationship with HM oligosaccharides HMOs and microbiome interactions which have not been extensively studied and may represent a prime area for future research.
