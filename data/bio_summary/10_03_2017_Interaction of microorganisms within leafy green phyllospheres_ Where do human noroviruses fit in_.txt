Studies have shown that vacuoles released by certain protozoa on lettuce and spinach can support the growth and survival of foodborne pathogens including E. coli L. monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica .ProtozoaThe presence of free-living protozoa FLP is common on leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach  .

Be- sides root uptake the internalization could also happen through cut lettuce leaves or the stomata of lettuce.

Nevertheless once internalized viruses cannot be easily removed compared to those existing on the surface of fresh produce.In addition studied the effect of biotic stressinfection with lettuce mosaic virus and abiotic stresses drought and flood on the internalization and dissemination of hNoV surrogates in soil grown romaine lettuce.

Polyphenol and flavonoids both exist in lettuce though the concentrations vary between different lettuce spe- cies.

As reported previously by  R-10 can digest lettuce cell wall structure and exposing HBGA-like carbohydrates leading to significantly increased binding of hNoV GII.4 VLPs to lettuce leaves.

However lettuce and inert surfaces clearly have different properties with lettuce surfaces presenting a much more complex environment--a living environment.

Internalization of sapovirus a sur- rogate for norovirus in romaine lettuce and the effect of lettuce latex on virus in- fectivity.

Unexpected pathogens have been associated with fresh produce including E. coli O157H7 in baby spinach Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in lettuce and Listeria mono- cytogenes in bagged salads etc.
