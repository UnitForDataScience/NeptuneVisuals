the reg3a rs7588571 non-gg genotype showed a trend toward a higher incidence of extensive chronic gvhd than the gg genotype 45 vs. 24 p  0.087.effect of rs7588571 genotype on other transplant outcomesin 109 evaluable patients the relapse rate at 4-years after transplantation was 23.5. the rs7588571 genotype did not affect the relapse rate and high-risk disease was the only signifi- cant factor for higher relapse rate hazard ratio hr 3.0 95 ci 1.3-7.1 p  0.012.in 109 evaluable patients nrm at 4-years after transplantation was 16.9. the rs7588571 genotype did not affect nrm and there was no significant factor for higher nrm.in 126 evaluable patients os at 4-years after transplantation was 62.8. the rs7588571 genotype did not affect os and high-risk disease was the only significant factor for lower os hr 0.36 95 ci 0.19-0.69 p  0.0019.comparison of the expression level of reg3a mrna in cells of each rs7588571 genotypethe rs7588571 is located upstream and within 2 kb of the reg3a gene and lies in the putative promoter region of reg3a .

however a significantly higher incidence of extensive chronic gvhd was observed in patients with the rs7588571 non-gg genotype than in those with the gg genotype odds ratio 2.6 95 confidence interval 1.1-6.0 p  0.029. semi-quantitative reverse transcription pcr demonstrated that the rs7588571 non-gg genotype exhibited a significantly lower reg3a mrna expression level than the gg genotype p  0.032 and western blot analysis demonstrated that the rs7588571 non-gg genotype exhibited a trend toward lower reg3a protein expression level than the gg genotype p  0.053. since reg proteins have several activities that function to control intestinal microbiota and since intestinal dysbiosis is in part responsible for the development of gvhd our findings lead to the novel concept that reg3a could have some protective effect in the pathogenesis of gvhd through the regulation of gut microbiota.introductiongraft-versus-host disease gvhd is a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .

all tests were two-sided and a p-value 0.05 was considered significant.resultsfrequencies of rs7588571 genotypesthe frequency of patients with gg ag and aa genotypes of the reg3a rs7588571 was 40.5 n  51 43.7 n  55 and 15.9 n  20 respectively and these frequencies were compatible with those reported in the hapmap-jpt database gg genotype 30.2 ag geno- type 57.0 and aa genotype 12.8.patient characteristics categorized by rs7588571 genotypepatient characteristics were categorized by the rs7588571 genotype .

the relative expression level of the reg3a rs7588571 non-gg genotype was significantly lower than that of the gg genotype p  0.032  right.comparison of the expression level of reg3a protein in cells of each rs7588571 genotypewe next investigated the expression of reg3a protein in three b-lcls per each rs7588571 genotype .

however due to the difficulty in collecting human intestinal tissue samples of each rs7588571 genotype preferably at least three samples per each genotype for triplicate experiments and due to the failure to detect reg3a mrna in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using real-time pcr data not shown we needed to find alternative cells for each rs7588571 genotype that had a common human tissue origin.

the incidence of extensive chronic gvhd in patients with the gg ag and aa genotype was 26 44 and 53 respectively p  0.063. the incidence of extensive chronic gvhd was signifi- cantly higher in patients with the non-gg genotype than in patients with the gg genotype 46 vs. 26 p  0.035. multivariate analysis demonstrated that the non-gg genotype was a risk factor for higher incidence of extensive chronic gvhd odds ratio 2.6 95 ci 1.1-6.0 p  0.029 .

the following variables were evaluated patient age s35 vs. 35 donor-recipient gender combination female to male vs. others disease standard risk disease vs. high risk disease conditioning regimen myeloablative regimen vs. reduced-intensity regimen recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus positive vs. negative years of transplantation 1987-1996 vs. 1997-2006 and rs7588571 genotype gg genotype vs. non- gg genotype.

additionally the rs7588571 non-gg genotype exhibited lower expression levels of reg3a mrna p  0.032 and reg3a protein p  0.053 than the ggexpression level of reg3a in b-lcls of each reg3a rs7588571 genotype.

in addition the difference in the degree of dysbiosis in post-transplant patients with each rs7588571 genotype should also be investigated.in summary rs7588571 genotype was associated with the expression level of reg3a mrna and reg3a protein and the incidence of extensive chronic gvhd in patients who had received an hla-matched sibling bone marrow transplant.

the reg3a rs7588571 non-gg genotype showed a trend toward a lower reg3a protein level than the gg genotype p  0.053  right.discussionto date there have been few reports supporting the role of reg3a in the pathophysiology of gvhd.

in humans it was reported that the expression of il-22 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was elevated in pediatric patients who had active chronic gvhd .in the present study the rs7588571 non-gg genotype was associated with higher incidence of extensive chronic gvhd after bone marrow transplantation bmt from a hla-matched sibling than the gg genotype.
