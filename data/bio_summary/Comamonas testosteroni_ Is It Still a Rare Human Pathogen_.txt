This group consists of four species C. terrigena C. testosteroni C. denitrificans C. nitrativorans.

Biliary secre- tions are rich in fatty acids and theoretically C. testosteroni can thrive in the bile-rich envi- ronment of the gall bladder an assumption that could be investigated.This is a rare incidence of C. testosteroni being a predominant organism in primary stoolculture in an elderly women with colostomy in situ.

We report a case of gastroenteritis caused by this organism in a 65-year-old female with colostomy in situ.c 2017 The AuthorsPublished by S. Karger AG BaselIntroductionComamonas belong to the genus Comamonas family Comamonadaceae which are be- taproteobacteria in the pseudomonas rRNA homology group III 1.

Comamonas testosteroni strains are capable of utilising testosterone 4-hydroxybenzoate acetate and lactate as their sole carbon sources but not glucose and most of the carbohydrates hence the name testos- teroni 2.

Comamonas species are aerobic gram-negative motile pink-pigmented oxidase- positive bacilli that grow well on routine bacteriological media.

The high genetic pliability of Comamonas species as well as their inherent ability as an environmental patho- gen to survive in various ecological niches make it a formidable candidate to cause mild but persistent infections especially in individuals with predisposing conditions.

Comamonas being one of them.

We recommend that patients on colostomies be put on probiotic prophylaxis since such patients frequently have a history of bowel disturbances.AcknowledgementThe authors are grateful to Ms. Shugufta Akhtar laboratory technician for her work.Statement of EthicsThe article was done according to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.Disclosure StatementThe authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesLipuma J Currie B Peacock S Vandamme P Burkholderia Stenotrophomonas Ralstonia Cupriavidus Pandoraea Brevundimonas Comamonas Delftia and Acidovorax in Jorgensen J Pfaller M Carroll K Funke G Landry M Richter S Warnock D eds Manual of Clinical Microbiology vol 43 ed 11.
