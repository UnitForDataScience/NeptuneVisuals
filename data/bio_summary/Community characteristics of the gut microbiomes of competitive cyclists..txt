smithii with the goal of uncovering why high meta- bolic activity by this archaeon would benefit professional cyclists RNA-Seq reads from eight of the professional cy- clists with high M. smithii mRNA abundance 8.0 were aligned to the reference M. smithii ATCC 35061.

Our results raise sev- eral questions would a given cyclist have an increased chance of becoming a professional athlete if they were colonized by M. smithii due to increased metabolism of the gut microbiome Or would a lifetime of training competition and a diet high in complex carbohydrates somehow influence a better niche for M. smithii to thrive where the gut is constantly subjected to physio- logical perturbations Exhausting endurance events are known to increase colonic transit time which would allow for increased growth time for archaea such as M. smithii .

Fisher'sexact test the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Spear- man's rank correlation coefficients with corresponding p values were calculated in R.For insight into what genes were most highly expressed by Methanobrevibacter smithii in the cy- clists RNA-Seq reads from eight professional cyclists with high activity of M. smithii 8 transcript rela- tive abundance were aligned to the reference gen- ome Methanobrevibacter smithii ATCC 35061 using the BWA.

M. smithii gene expression was highly variable between cyclists but was highest in professional-level cy- clists compared to CAT 1 cyclists as determined with Fish- er's exact test p  0.001 see Additional file for summary of M. smithii abundance in all cyclists.

Because some samples showed the pres- ence of M. smithii in RNA-Seq analysis but not in mWGS data qPCR was done on all mWGS samples using 16S primers designed for M. smithii.

Indeed the blooms of M. smithii activity from the cyclists and the subsequent correlations between methane metabolism and pathways involved in carbohydrate and energy metab- olism suggest a more energetically efficient gut micro- biome when M. smithii is active.

While it is possible that there could have been some bias towards enrichment of M. smithii transcripts due to increased stability of M. smithii mRNA compared to bacterial mRNA we do not feel this bias negatively in- fluenced results.

In addition the types of transcripts enriched for across cyclists' who had increased abundance of M. smithii all showed similar trends in what pathways were most expressed most notably methanogenesis.In addition to understanding what would drive a bloom of M. smithii there is interest in determining why there is such a high percentage of colonization byM.

The species abundance tables Additional file  showed this was due to transcriptional activity of Methanobrevibac- ter smithii.

Transcriptional ac- tivity by M. smithii was identified in 1522 professional cy- clists compared to only 111 CAT 1 cyclists with relative abundances ranging from 0.2 to 41.0 in the professional cyclists.
