.A statistically significant correlation was detected between Ruminococcaceae and glucose Pearson correla- tion r  0.31 P  0.007 but not with hs-CRP r  -0.150 P  0.20 or insulin r  0.09 P  0.45.DiscussionWe demonstrated that the gut microbiota composition par- ticularly the Ruminococcaceae family differs in women who develop GDM compared with women who do not develop GDM.To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the link between gut microbiota composition and the onset of GDM.

We hypothesized that gutmicrobiota may be involved in the development of GDM possibly through inflammation-driven alterations in glucose metabolism .We measured whether gut microbiota composition in early pregnancy differs in women who developed GDM from that of women who did not develop GDM in later pregnancy.MethodsThis study included 75 overweight and obese women without GDM at early pregnancy.

60 of the women 915 with GDM and 12 of the women 760 without GDM had Ruminococcaceae abundance above the cut-off value.

Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 23.0 by a statistician TV independent of the study planning and execution.ResultsThe faecal microbiota differed in women who developed GDM n  15 from those who did not develop GDM n  60 in class Clostridia Supplemental Table S1 and in family Ruminococcaceae in an unidentified genus and species of family Ruminococcaceae Table .

Additionally distinct gut microbiota composi- tions have been observed in insulin-resistant women withTable 1 Relative abundance median IQR  of faecal Ruminococcaceae family unidentified genus and species of the Ruminococcaceae fam- ily in the two study groupsadjusted PaMann-Whitney U tests between the two study groupsbBH-adjusted P values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate at each taxonomic level.

All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of South-west Finland.1 31148Acta Diabetol 2017 541147-1149Mann-Whitney U tests were used for the initial analyses to compare the gut microbiota in women who developed GDM with that in women who did not develop GDM.

Although we had relatively small number of women the study was prospective and carefully characterized the preg- nant women in a clinical trial setting.

The difference in Ruminococcaceae between the women who developed GDM and those who did not develop GDM remained statistically significant regardless the exclusion of these women.Increased relative abundance of the Ruminococcaceaefamily was associated with higher odds of a positive GDMdiagnosis the OR for a percent point increase in Ruminococ- caceae was 1.12 95 CI 1.02-1.2 adjusted for BMI inter- vention group gestational weeks and fat and fibre intake P  0.017.

A signifi-cant difference in fasting glucose and insulin at early preg- nancy Supplemental Table S2 was detected in women who developed GDM compared to those who did not develop GDM further adjustment on the basis of glucose resulted in a non-statistically significant relationship adjusted OR 1.071 95 CI 0.981-1.170 P  0.125.The optimal cut-off value for the Ruminococcaceae family was defined as  26.8 values above this cut-off predicted positive GDM diagnosis with a sensitivity of 60 95 CI 35-85 and a specificity of 88 95 CI 80-96.

A recent study reporting  the correlation between Ruminococcaceae and markers of glucose metabo- lism namely insulin and C-peptide measured in overweight and obese women in early pregnancy supports our study hypothesis.
