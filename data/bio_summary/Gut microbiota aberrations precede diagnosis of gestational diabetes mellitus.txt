the difference in ruminococcaceae between the women who developed gdm and those who did not develop gdm remained statistically significant regardless the exclusion of these women.increased relative abundance of the ruminococcaceaefamily was associated with higher odds of a positive gdmdiagnosis the or for a percent point increase in ruminococ- caceae was 1.12 95 ci 1.02-1.2 adjusted for bmi inter- vention group gestational weeks and fat and fibre intake p  0.017. the same was detected after further adjustment for parents' type two diabetes or metabolic syndrome or 1.095 95 ci 1.004-1.193 p  0.039 n  67. a signifi-cant difference in fasting glucose and insulin at early preg- nancy supplemental table s2 was detected in women who developed gdm compared to those who did not develop gdm further adjustment on the basis of glucose resulted in a non-statistically significant relationship adjusted or 1.071 95 ci 0.981-1.170 p  0.125.the optimal cut-off value for the ruminococcaceae family was defined as  26.8 values above this cut-off predicted positive gdm diagnosis with a sensitivity of 60 95 ci 35-85 and a specificity of 88 95 ci 80-96.

we hypothesized that gutmicrobiota may be involved in the development of gdm possibly through inflammation-driven alterations in glucose metabolism .we measured whether gut microbiota composition in early pregnancy differs in women who developed gdm from that of women who did not develop gdm in later pregnancy.methodsthis study included 75 overweight and obese women without gdm at early pregnancy.

60 of the women 915 with gdm and 12 of the women 760 without gdm had ruminococcaceae abundance above the cut-off value.

although we had relatively small number of women the study was prospective and carefully characterized the preg- nant women in a clinical trial setting.

a recent study reporting  the correlation between ruminococcaceae and markers of glucose metabo- lism namely insulin and c-peptide measured in overweight and obese women in early pregnancy supports our study hypothesis.

the auc was 0.73 95 ci 0.57-0.88. an opti- mal cut-off value for ruminococcaceae circle in figure for maximiz- ing the youden index was  26.8 with a sensitivity of 60 95 ci 35-85 and a specificity of 88 95 ci 80-96recent gdm compared with women after a normoglycaemic pregnancy .

it is also possible that ruminococcaceae promoted impairment in glucose homoeostasis through inflamma- tion and consequently altered insulin signalling although we did not detect a correlation between ruminococcaceae and hs-crp.

whether microbiota composition contributes to the development of gdm the common condition in pregnant women is currently unknown.

four of the women who did not develop gdm had used antibiotics within three weeks prior to the study visit.
