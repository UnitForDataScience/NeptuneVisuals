For example a study of one cholera patient from Haitishowed that phage-resistant V. cholerae mutants rose to high frequency within the patient due to positive selection imposed by phage predation The study showed how strong selec- tion can shape V. cholerae diversity within patients but the prevalence and extent of V. cholerae genetic diversity within patients remains unclear and also whether intra-host evolu- tion is generally driven by selection.As for many other bacterial pathogens the prevailing ortho- doxy is that V. cholerae infections are essentially clonal and essentially devoid of within-host genetic diversity.

To investigate the role of natural selectionwithin versus between patients we performed the McDo- nald-Kreitman test  and also conducted permutations to identify any patients with an excess of non-synonymous iSNVs compared to random distribution of iSNVs across patients Supplementary Methods.Liquid culture and biofilm growth assays of isolates from patients H1 and H2To identify possible phenotypes conferred by the within- patient variations we performed in vitro experiments on the isolates from patient H1 harbouring the three NS point mutations and the isolate for which the Bacteroides plasmid was detected in patient H2.

This suggests positive or bal- ancing selection on NS iSNVs within patient H1 or relaxed purifying selection in patient H1 compared to other patients.The three NS iSNVs in patient H1 occurred in two genes.

In summary within-patient mutations in vprB but not another mutation within the same patient significantly reduced the ability of V. cholerae to form biofilms.In the case of patient H2 we found that the presence of a plasmid of putative Bacteroides origin reduces biofilm for- mation even more strongly than point mutations in vprB.

However we identified an excess of NS mutations in one Haitian patient H1 suggesting positive or diversifying selection on V. cholerae within this patient .

However the extent of within-patient mutation HGT and natural selection are still poorly known for V. cholerae.In this study we characterized genomic diversity of V. chol- erae within and between eight cholera patients sequencing between eight and 20 isolate genomes per patient.

Even under the conservative assumption that all gene content variation represents a single gainloss event per patient this still indicates at least one event per patient.Some of the putative HGT events could have consequences for V. cholerae survival and virulence within the host.

In con- trast we found a substantial amount of gene content varia- tion between five and 103 gene gains or losses within each patient.

For example comparisons of whole-genome sequences of strains of V. cholerae from across the world over the course of a century clarified the history of theReceived 1 September 2017 Accepted 12 November 2017Author affiliations 1Department of Biological Sciences University of Montreal Montreal Quebec Canada 2Division of Infectious Diseases Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA USA 3Department of Medicine Harvard Medical School Boston MA USA 4Center for Vaccine Sciences International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Dhaka Bangladesh 5National Public Health Laboratory Ministry of Public Health and Population Port-au-Prince Haiti 6Division of Global Health Equity Brigham and Women's Hospital Boston MA USA 7Department of Global Health and Social Medicine Harvard Medical School Boston MA USA 8Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases Harvard School of Public Health Boston MA USA 9Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology Harvard Medical School Boston MA USA 10Department of Pediatrics Harvard Medical School Boston MA USA.Correspondence B.

Together these results suggest that most within-patient variation in gene content is due to gene flow deletion or duplication within the V. cholerae population with rare but detectable HGT from other bacte- rial species phages and plasmids in the gut microbiota.
