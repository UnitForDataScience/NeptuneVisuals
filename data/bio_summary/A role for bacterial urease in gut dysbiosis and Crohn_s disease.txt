Whereas the shifts in both bacterial community structure and gene expression may be linked to a variety of factors the predominance of the sulfur relay system in the gut microbiome of patients with Crohn's disease emphasizes the possible importance of nitrogen metabolism in the development of the dysbiotic gut microbiota.Ni et al.Page 9The notion that bacterial nitrogen metabolism plays a role in the development of dysbiosis is supported by the strong positive correlation between Proteobacteria taxa found in the dysbiotic microbiota of patients with IBD 5 and our fecal metabolomic profiling showing a strong association between dysbiosis and quantities of fecal amino acids.

These quantities were comparable to the reduction observed in the feces of ABXPEG-treated mice and thus demonstrate the importance of urease in the flux of nitrogen for amino acid synthesis by the gut microbiota.Reduction of gut bacterial load promotes the establishment of a new steady state in colonized miceWe have previously shown that the combined use of antibiotics and PEG reduces the endogenous bacterial load in the murine gut 23 and that this reduction is required for engraftment of a defined bacterial consortium.

We used in vivo heavy isotope assays using 15N-labeled urea to determine the effect of bacterial urease on bacterial nitrogen flux where 15N was incorporated into bacterial amino acids in a urease-dependent fashion.

Anaerobic culture conditions for CFU determination of bacterial load were performed as previously described 51.DNA extraction 16S rRNA amplification sequencing and analysisTotal DNA was extracted from mouse fecal pellet and bacterial gavage samples using the MO BIO PowerSoil-htp kit.

Finally we demonstrated the functional consequences of the dysbiotic microbiota engineered through inoculation of a urease-positive Ure E. coli strain by showing exacerbation of disease in a T cell adoptive transfer mouse model of colitis 24.The ability to engineer the mouse gut microbiota into either a dysbiotic or a more normal configuration by the inoculation of a single aerotolerant taxon with or without urease enzymatic activity provides a proof of concept that a single defined bacterial strain can reconfigure the gut microbiota.Ni et al.Page 4RESULTSThe presence of amino acids in fecal microbiota from patients with Crohn's disease positively correlates with disease activityUsing shotgun metagenomic sequencing we previously reported the characterization of the fecal microbiome of 90 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease receiving either anti-tumor necrosis factor TNF or dietary therapy and compared these data to those from 26 healthy control children 5.

S1 C and D suggested that the presence of increased fecal amino acids in pediatric Crohn's disease patients was in part due to the gut microbiota.Fecal amino acids positively correlate with Proteobacteria in pediatric patients with Crohn's diseaseIn pediatric patients with Crohn's disease quantities of fecal amino acids and their derivatives positively correlated with a dysbiotic composition of the gut microbiota defined by gut bacterial composition and gene types that we previously labeled as cluster 2 Fig.

Associations between bacterial taxa abundance ascertained by fecal shotgun metagenomic sequencing and the fecal metabolomein healthy pediatric subjects and those with Crohn's diseaseSpearman rank correlation with the direction and strength of association indicated by the color index in the figure.

These bacterial lineages also induce intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD 11 12 22.Ammonia a product of urea hydrolysis produced by bacterial urease in the mammalian intestinal tract is a major source of nitrogen for bacteria.

Using our recently described method for altering the gut microbiota in previously colonized mouse hosts 23 we show that inoculation of a single aerotolerant bacterial species Escherichia coli into conventional mice pretreated with antibiotics and polyethylene glycol PEG altered the gutmicrobiota in a manner dependent on the presence or absence of a bacterial urease gene.

This led us to hypothesize a role for urease enzymatic activity in shaping the dysbiotic microbiota given its importance in bacterial nitrogen flux ammonia production and the subsequent incorporation of ammonia into bacterial amino acids Fig.
