the enrolled patients were randomly assigned to the experimental n  38 or the control group n  37. these patients did not show clear risk factors such as overweight dm or hypertriglyceridemia for nash developmentbut were characterized by the nash phenotype defined as steatohepatitis with elevated levels of ggt 45 ul and alt 40 ul.

the experimental group received the additional lbsf probiotic cocktail.

in the control group a significant decrease in serum cholesterol level was observed p  0.05 whereas serum alt and ggt levels remained unchanged.

in contrast in the experimental group 12-week therapy with lbsf significantly decreased the serum levels of alt and ast p  0.05 returning both to within the normal range and improved liver stiffness p  0.05 table however the decrease in ggt level was not statistically significant between the two groups and hepatosteatosis persisted as evidenced by ultrasound examination.
