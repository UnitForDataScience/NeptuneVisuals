Accordingly liver stiffness was decreased in the probiotic-treated group compared with the control group P  0.05.

Furthermore the decreases in BMI and cholesterol level were more pronounced in the exper- imental group than in the control group P  0.05c 2017 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch Chinese Society of Gastroenterology Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University Schoolof Medicine and John Wiley  Sons Australia LtdTable 1.
