subject 1 as shown in figure 1 had 10 phyla mostly dominated by firmicutes 53.92 followed byfigure 5 the clustered bar representing the core genera that occurred with high relative abundance in subjects 1 2 and 3 nigerian journal of clinical practice  volume 20  issue 10  october 2017 proteobacteria 24.48 actinobacteria 15.10bacteroides 5.11 fusobacteria 1.10acidobacteria 0.25 spirochaetes 0.03cyanobacteria 0.0029 streptophyta 0.00189 andcandidatus saccharibacteria 0.00189. subject 2 had 10 phyla dominated by firmicutes 48.70 followed by proteobacteria 45.99 bacteroides 2.26actinobacteria1.76fusobacteria0.80spirochaetes0.23tenericutes0.093synergistetes 0.072 streptophyta 0.069 and candidatus saccharibacteria 0.0047. subject 3 had only six phyla mainly dominatedfigure 6 the venn diagram representing the species that are shared among the subjects and those that are commonbyfirmicutes74.40followedbyproteobacteria10.55actinobacteria9.93bacteroides3.82fusobacteria1.21andcandidatus saccharibacteria 0.072. figure 2 shows the six phyla that are common in all the subjects indicating higher abundance of firmicutes and candidatus saccharibacteria in subject 3 and more abundance of proteobacteria in subject 2. subject 1 had more abundance of actinobacteria greater than subject 3 and subject 3 greater than subject 2. however some sequence reads in the bacteria kingdom could not be classified.a total of 70 genera were detected from the three cases.

the microbial diversity score indicates that subject 1's oral microbiome was more diverse in terms of species richness than subject 2 and subject 3. although the inverse simpson's index for subject 3 is higher than subject 2 it remains to be determined if age was any contributing factor for the differences observed in oral microbial diversity.

in terms of absolute genera count subject 1 had 966411 subject 2 had 993366 and subject 3 had 994895 as shown in figure 3. subject 1 had eight exclusive genera representing 11.3 which includes parascardovia weissella slackia comamonas shuttleworthia anoxybacillus howardella and enterobacter.

for example the genus gemella identified in subject 1 and subject 3 individuals was not defined as a core-microbiome genus in previous studies of salivary bacterial communities.11 gemella is depleted in the presence of tooth decay and an increase is correlated with good oral hygiene and they are present in low abundance in subject 1 and 3 but not in subject 2. bacterial genera associated with health are present in the three subjects with variable occurrence as shown in figure 11 notably streptococcus neisseria porphyromonas prevotella and veillonella.however some species such as p. gingivalis andt.

the subject 3 diversity score was higher than subject 2 and one of the reasons that could be attributed to the difference may due to the oral history nigerian journal of clinical practice  volume 20  issue 10  october 2017and bacterial species associated with oral disease presentin subject 2.the predominance of the phylum- firmicutes in the subjects 53.92 48.70 74.40 and other phyla such as proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroides and fusobacteria that contributed at least 0.1 are considered abundant in the oral microbiome.

this is similar in a previous study that looked at the core microbiome of oral microbial communities by sequencing the microbiomes from several intraoral niches dental surfaces cheek hard palate tongue and saliva in three healthy individuals.11the preponderance of firmicutes in subject 3 with 74.40 is very noteworthy when compared with subject 1 and subject 2. other studies have compared the microbiome of adult saliva14 and child saliva appears to have a higher proportion of firmicutes and actinobacteria and a lower proportion of bacteroidetes fusobacteria and spiirochaetes at all stages of the dentition.12the presence of candidatus saccharibacteria in the subjects less abundant but relatively higher in subject3 needs more insight.

the high predominance by h. parainfluenzae 80.65 in subject 2 is very interesting although the subject claimed to have healthy oral hygiene.

oral samples were collected from three female subjects postmenopausal premenopausal and prepubertal hereby referred to as subject 1 2 and 3 respectively after informed verbal consent.

subject 2 is a 28-year-old female who claimed to brush her teeth twice daily with a soft brush and oral b toothpaste.

she had scurvy several times and treated with vitamin c. she ate lotsfigure 1 relative abundance of the phyla taxa represented as 100 stacked barfigure 2 two-d pie chart of the six phyla that are common in all the subjects indicating higher abundance of firmicutes and candidatus saccharibacteriain subject 3 nigerian journal of clinical practice  volume 20  issue 10  october 2017figure 3 the absolute total bacterial count in the genera in the three subjectsfigure 4 the venn diagram representing the genera that are shared among the subjects and those that are commonof sugary confectionaries.

subject 3 is an 8-year-old female with no oral maladies as at the time of sample collection.sequence characteristicson average the data sets generated 46109 high-quality sequences per sample totaling a mean of 6868637 base-pairs bp with an average length of 149 bp 149 - 13 bp.

post-qc produced an average base-pair count of 278367 bp postsequence count of 1972 mean sequence length of 141 - 25 bp and mean guanine-cytosine percent of 55 - 4. subject 1 had 4400 sequences 9.54 that failed to pass the qc pipeline while subjects 2 and 3 had 4337 sequences 8.18 and 5759 sequences 7.98 respectively that failed the qc pipeline.oral bacterial compositionsthe diversity and bacterial community compositions of the three cases were explored by comparing the relative abundance at different taxonomic levels.

subjects 1 and 3 had 52 genera while subject 2 had 50 genera.

subject 2 had nine exclusive genera 12.7 comprising pasteurella mycoplasma odoribacter eggerthia peptococcus moraxella phocaecola desulfomicrobium and bulleidia.
