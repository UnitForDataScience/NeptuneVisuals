There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of the core genera among the subjects subject 1 versus subject 2 P  0.5294 subject 1 versus 3 P  0.3932 subject 2 versus 3 P  0.4244.

For example the genus Gemella identified in subject 1 and subject 3 individuals was not defined as a core-microbiome genus in previous studies of salivary bacterial communities.11 Gemella is depleted in the presence of tooth decay and an increase is correlated with good oral hygiene and they are present in low abundance in subject 1 and 3 but not in subject 2.

Subject 1 had more abundance of Actinobacteria greater than subject 3 and subject 3 greater than subject 2.

In terms of absolute genera count subject 1 had 966411 subject 2 had 993366 and subject 3 had 994895 as shown in Figure 3.

The microbial diversity score indicates that subject 1's oral microbiome was more diverse in terms of species richness than subject 2 and subject 3.

The subject 3 diversity score was higher than subject 2 and one of the reasons that could be attributed to the difference may due to the oral history Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice  Volume 20  Issue 10  October 2017and bacterial species associated with oral disease presentin subject 2.The predominance of the phylum- Firmicutes in the subjects 53.92 48.70 74.40 and other phyla such as Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Bacteroides and Fusobacteria that contributed at least 0.1 are considered abundant in the oral microbiome.

This is similar in a previous study that looked at the core microbiome of oral microbial communities by sequencing the microbiomes from several intraoral niches dental surfaces cheek hard palate tongue and saliva in three healthy individuals.11The preponderance of Firmicutes in subject 3 with 74.40 is very noteworthy when compared with subject 1 and subject 2.

Figure 2 shows the six phyla that are common in all the subjects indicating higher abundance of Firmicutes and Candidatus Saccharibacteria in subject 3 and more abundance of Proteobacteria in subject 2.

Although the inverse Simpson's index for subject 3 is higher than subject 2 it remains to be determined if age was any contributing factor for the differences observed in oral microbial diversity.
