Although MAIT cells in HCT grafts expressed Ki67 at levels similar to those from healthy individuals Ki67 healthy donors .38 n  5 PBSC grafts 1.30 n  6 P  .42 the fraction of Ki67 MAIT cells had increased more than 10-fold in the recipient compared with the PBSC graft by day 10 after HCT .We identified no difference in the fraction of Ki67 MAIT cells after MA or NMA HCT .Because MAIT cells efflux ABCB1 substrate drugs  it was unknown if recipient MAIT cells could survive conditioning chemotherapy and contribute to early MAIT cell recovery or if early MAIT cell recovery was donor-derived.

Responder T cells were labeled with .5 mM CFSE Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester 2.5 x 104 CFSE-labeled responder T cells were stimu- lated with Dynabeads CD3CD28 T Cell Expander Dynal Biotech Invitrogen Carlsbad CA and cultured with MAIT cells or responder T cells at a ratio of 11 12 14 and 18 MAIT-to-responder in round-bottom 96-well plates for 4 days.

To address this question we performed short tandem repeat PCR chimerism studies on CD3 T cells CD33 myeloid cells CD56 cells and sort-purified MAIT cells isolated from the blood of HCT recipients.

In contrast we did not observe an association between MAIT cell reconstitution and the number of CD34 cells in the PBSC graft  or with the number of graft CD19 B cells which are required for neonatal MAIT cell accumulation Supplementary Figure S2 .To determine whether MAIT cells that are transferred in the PBSC graft contribute to MAIT cell recovery in the recip- ient we sequenced the TRBV genes in MAIT cells isolated from an aliquot of the PBSC graft and from the recipient's blood n  5 and evaluated the fraction of sequences in the recip- ient that were also found in the PBSC graft.

MAIT cells identified as CD3CD8CD161hiVa7.2 events and conventional T cells CD3CD8CD161loVa7.2- events were sort purified from enriched CD8 T cells using a FACS ARIA 2 flow sorter BD Biosciences.Activation and Proliferation AssaysIsolated MAIT and conventional T cell subsets were activated or not with plate-bound aCD3 OKT3 Ortho Biotech Bridge Water NJ and cultured in 96-well plates at 1 to 2 x 104 cellswell in 200 mL RPMI 1640 medium with 10 human serum penicillinstreptomycin b-mercaptoethanol and L-glutamine with or without cytokine supplementation.

Blood and stool samples used for correlation of MAIT cell counts and bacterial abundance respectively were collected within a week of each other.In Vitro Suppressive AssayMAIT cells identified as Va7.2 CD161 cells and CD4 CD25- re- sponder T cells were sorted from the peripheral blood of 3 healthy donors.

MAIT cells stimulated with anti-CD3 OKT3 mAb alone failed to upregulate Ki67 and proliferate and exhibited reduced Lck ZAP-70 and CD3z phosphorylation compared with naive central and effector memory subsets of conventional CD8 T cells  Supplementary Figure S3 consistent with our previous work that identified downregulation of genes encoding components of the proximal TCR signaling pathway in MAIT cells .

We examined the TRBV repertoire in MAIT cells that were isolated from the blood of HCT recipients and found that TRBV diversity was similar in healthy donors and PBSCT recipients however in contrast to the stability of the TCR repertoire in MAIT cells from healthy donors  there was variability in TRBV di- versity  sequence sharing  and the contribution of distinct TRBV clonotypes  in the MAIT cell repertoire at different times after HCT indicative of alteration in the clonal composition of MAIT cells over time in HCT recipients.

CFSE-labeled CD4 responder T cells were stimulated with aCD328 beads for 4 days in the presence of MAIT cells or CD4 responder T cells at a ratio of 11 12 14 18 and 116 MAIT-to-responder.

Development of reproducible methods for detecting and quantitating MAIT cells in mucosal tissues will be pivotal in determining whether the increased risk of GVHD associated with low MAIT cell counts is because of their migration into inflamed sites before the presenta- tion of clinically apparent GVHD or if MAIT cells possess regulatory activity that decreases the risk of GVHD.Examination of chemokine receptor expression on MAIT cells might provide additional insight into the mechanisms by which MAIT cell counts in blood fall before the onset of clin- ical acute GVHD.
