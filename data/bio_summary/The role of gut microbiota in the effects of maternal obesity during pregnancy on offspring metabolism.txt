This review discusses therole of the microbiota in the impact of maternal obesity during pregnancy on offspring metabolismand further analyzes related probiotic or prebiotic interventions to prevent and treat obesity andmetabolic diseases.Keywords gut microbiota maternal obesity offspring metabolism pregnancy probioticprebioticIntroductionObesity has become an epidemic disease and is associated with tremendous health andeconomic burden all over the world.

In this review we discuss the role of the gut microbiota in the impact ofmaternal obesity during pregnancy on offspring metabolic health and further explore relatedstrategies including probiotic and prebiotic strategies to prevent and treat obesity andobesity-related diseases.Impact of obesity during pregnancy on maternal and offspring metabolismWith changes in diet and lifestyle numerous evidence has demonstrated that the prevalence ofobesity in women of childbearing ages is still increasing rapidly 39-41.

A population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands detectedthat maternal obesity during pregnancy increased the risks of gestational diabetes gestationalhypertension preeclampsia and caesarean section compared to pregnancy with normal weight 43.Similarly another systematic review of 22 reviews also showed that gestational diabetespre-eclampsia gestational hypertension depression instrumental and caesarean delivery andsurgical site infection were strongly linked with maternal obesity in contrast to women withnormal body mass index BMI.

Thereforemore studies are needed to reveal the time and mechanism of vertical microbiota transmission andcolonization in offspring.The effects of maternal obesity on the offspring gut microbiotaBoth our own studies and other studies have shown that maternal HFD could program asignificantly increased predisposition to obesity and metabolic disorders in offspring 4688-90.As mentioned above obesity of pregnant mothers alters the abundance and diversity of the gutmicrobiota and thus as a detrimental intrauterine developmental environment may influence theestablishment of the microbial community in offspring.

Large numbers of human and animal studies havedemonstrated that the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in obesity and metabolic diseases.Similarly maternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with alterations in the composition anddiversity of the intestine microbial community.

Therefore the gut microbiota might be a critical factor in the explanation of thephenomenon put forth by the DOHaD Hypothesis.Maternal obesity during pregnancy and alterations in gut microbiotaIn the context of normal pregnancy bodies undergo substantial changes includingimmunological adaption and hormonal and metabolic alterations to support the growth anddevelopment of the fetus53.

Thereafter the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease DOHaD hypothesiswas brought forward in the last decade 45 which proposed that an adverse developmentalenvironment in utero and early post-natal life negatively influences long-term health and increasesthe risk of developing obesity6 diabetes7 cardiovascular disease8 and other chronic diseases.Hence maternal obesity during pregnancy programs an increased risk of the offspring developingmetabolic disturbances.

Hence maternal obesity during pregnancy is accompanied with gutmicrobiota dysbiosis with a simultaneous development of metabolic disorders which could affectmicrobiota transmission from the mother to offspring and further result in offspring metabolicdisturbances Figure 1.

Maternal obesity duringpregnancy resulting in a poor intrauterine environment has adverse outcomes for both the motherand child42.Obesity in pregnancy not only affects maternal metabolism but also leads to detrimentalpregnancy outcomes.

A recent study of a porcinemodel with the use of positron emission tomography PET showed that maternal HFD led tohigher brain glucose metabolism and brain insulin receptors IRbs at birth in offspring followedby a long-term decrease in brain glucose uptake and glucose transporter 4 GLUT4 and IRbexpression in minipigs which may increase the predisposition to metabolic-neurodegenerativediseases in offspring52.Hence obesity during pregnancy serves as a detrimental developmental environment thatincreases the risk of the development of metabolic diseases in both the mother and offspring.However the specific mechanisms are not entirely understood.
