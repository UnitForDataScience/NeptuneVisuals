These results imply that AI pretreated inoculum application enhances VFA production partic- ularly in acetic acid composition which further leads to high H2 production in the reactor.In both untreated control and AI pretreated sample the maincontributors for H2 production through acetogenesis process belonged to genus Clostridium of phylum Firmicutes and genus Pseudomonas of class Gammaproteobacteria.

In pretreated sample 41 reads representing OTU6 showed 95 sequence similarity with Propionivibrio dicarboxylicus CreMal1T NR 026477.1 16 sequences representing OTU10 belonged to Comamonas terrigena LMG 1253T AJ430342.1 and remaining sequences showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities ranging from 97 to 100 with genera Pando- raea Comamonas Ideonella and Azospira.Sequences of control 147 5.8 and pretreated 173 7.3 samples has also showed similarity to the class Gammaproteobacteria H. 126 sequences of OTU5 in control sample and 164 sequences of OTU4 in pretreated sample showed 100 sequence similarity with Pseudomonas sp.

Several enriched Clos- tridial species in pretreated sample were rather not present in con- trol sample C. Moreover species belonging to genus Clostridium are mainly involved in fermenting carbohydrates to H2 production  and are also implicated as acetogenic bacteria which are abundant in the AI pretreated sample.

Various pretreatment strategies employed and studied for H2 and methane production processes using differ- ent wastes was reported  .The present study deals with assessing the microbial dynamics and H2 production in reactors operating with the combined pretreated inoculum acid-shock and iodopropane AI compared to untreated control inoculum.

Keeping this in view combined pretreatment with acid-shock and iodopropane was used which would suppress the methanogenic metabolic process and thus enhance H2 production  .Hydrogen productionBiohydrogen production profiles were plotted for both pretreated and control operations with function of cycle operation A.

Initially no difference in H2 production was observed in both bioreactors however after 15th cycle of operation onwards increment in H2 production was seen in the pretreated system.

VFA profile enumerates the changes occurring during the fermentation process D. Com- paratively higher VFA production was observed with pretreated inoculum compared to control which correlated well with the H2 production pattern.

Differences in  number of OTUs were compared between control sample and pretreated sample A-H and it is apparent that OTUs belonging to Firmicutes significantly increased in pretreated sample A.

Similarly in pretreated sample all the other sequences belonged to genera Paludibacter Niabella Bac- teroidetes bacterium oral taxon clone anaerobic bacterium anduncultured bacterium clones .About 30.2 of control sample reads accounting for 761 reads and 46 of reads in pretreated sample accounting for 1083 sequences belonged to Alphaproteobactera  F. In control sample 95.3 of alphaproteobacterial sequences belonging to OTU1 725 reads shared 100 sequence similarity with Novosphingobium capsulatum RIG1 GQ891714.1.
