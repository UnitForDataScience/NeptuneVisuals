All of the overloaded plates were considered to have a higher load than 500 CFUm3 due to health protection reasons.Regarding the air bacteria load most of optical shops indicated higher concentrations indoors than outdoors suggesting bacterial sources from indoors but only one store did not comply with the legal norms .Air fungal identification was used to characterize the fungal burden present indoors but also to verify the legal compliance.

In ten shops the indoor fungal load was higher than the outdoors surpassing the legal requirement Figure .On the surfaces it was estimated that the fungal load ranged from 1 CFUm2 to 7 106 CFUm2 in clientpatient rooms and from 1 CFUm2 to 5 106 CFUm2 in optometry offices not considering the overloaded samples.

This result highlights the need to also collect samples from surfaces besides air in this setting to ensure a more complete fungal contamination assessment .In nine of the 13 trial frames assessed the fungi species were identified always being the equipment with higher fungal load in the analysed optical shops.

Moreover it was found that an external company ensured indoor cleaning in four 30.8 of the optical shops and all of the health professionals confirmed that the optical equipment was disinfected with alcohol with the exception made to pupilometers between patients and hand-washing was ensured between patients in 11 75.6 optical shops.

To compare fungal bacteria load and particle size concentration between the optical shops that use brooms for cleaning purposes and the ones that do not a Mann-Whitney test was applied.ResultsWalkthrough Survey and ChecklistThe collected data allowed obtaining crucial information to identify potential contamination sources from the indoor environment.

Additionally there is no mandatory training for the health professionals working at optical shops as this type of organization is not regulated as part of the health system in Portugal.Fungal and Bacteria LoadAir fungal load in clientpatient rooms ranged from 24 CFUm3 to 500 CFUm3 and in optometry offices from 1 CFUm3 to 500 CFUm3 Figure .

Bacteria load present in air and on surfaces from the optical shops assessed.Fungal IdentificationThe fungal diversity present in the samples was characterized based on the morphological features of the colonies Table .

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study developed in this specific setting and can be the first step towards a future protocol to ensure the proper microbiota and particle matter assessment in optical shops.ConclusionsThis work fills a gap providing information on the microbiota background and particulate matter in optical shops that provide contact lens services and also their compliance with legal requirements.This study suggests the indicators that are representative of harmful fungal and bacterial contamination contributing to a future protocol to properly assess these pollutants.

Public health intervention is needed to assure the quality and safety of the rooms and equipment in optical shops that perform health interventions in patients.Keywords indoor air quality microbiota particulate matter assessment optical shops contact lenses bioaerosolsIntroductionContact lenses are used for refractive correction cosmetic enhancement and other therapeutic reasons .
