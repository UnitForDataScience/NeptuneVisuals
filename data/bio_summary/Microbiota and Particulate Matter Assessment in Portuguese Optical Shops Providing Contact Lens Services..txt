to study the relationship between fungal load bacteria load and particle matter and also to study the previous environmental variables' relationship with temperature and relative humidity the spearman correlation coefficient was applied since the normality assumption was not verified p  0.05. to compare fungal bacteria load and particle size concentration between the optical shops that use brooms for cleaning purposes and the ones that do not a mann-whitney test was applied.resultswalkthrough survey and checklistthe collected data allowed obtaining crucial information to identify potential contamination sources from the indoor environment.

in ten shops the indoor fungal load was higher than the outdoors surpassing the legal requirement figure .on the surfaces it was estimated that the fungal load ranged from 1 cfum2 to 7 106 cfum2 in clientpatient rooms and from 1 cfum2 to 5 106 cfum2 in optometry offices not considering the overloaded samples.

all of the overloaded plates were considered to have a higher load than 500 cfum3 due to health protection reasons.regarding the air bacteria load most of optical shops indicated higher concentrations indoors than outdoors suggesting bacterial sources from indoors but only one store did not comply with the legal norms .air fungal identification was used to characterize the fungal burden present indoors but also to verify the legal compliance.

fungal load in air and on surfaces and equipment presented moderate or strong positive correlation that could indicate that when fungal load in air increases the same could occur on surfaces and equipment.

however a significant negative correlation was found between temperature and particulate matter concentration pm2.5 rs  -0.760 p  0.011 air fungal load rs  -0.693 p  0.026 and bacterial concentration on surfaces rs  -0.778 p  0.008. these results indicate that the higher the temperature the lower the particulate matter concentration pm2.5 air fungal load and bacterial concentration on surfaces.

this result highlights the need to also collect samples from surfaces besides air in this setting to ensure a more complete fungal contamination assessment .in nine of the 13 trial frames assessed the fungi species were identified always being the equipment with higher fungal load in the analysed optical shops.

ten from the 26 surfaces samples were overloaded 500 cfum2 and impossible to count colonies figure .figure 1. fungal load present in the air and on surfaces from the assessed optical shops.evidence of fungal contamination was also found in equipment samples.

however a negative correlation moderate to strong between fungi and bacteria was found suggesting that high fungal load is correlated with low bacteria load.

additionally there is no mandatory training for the health professionals working at optical shops as this type of organization is not regulated as part of the health system in portugal.fungal and bacteria loadair fungal load in clientpatient rooms ranged from 24 cfum3 to 500 cfum3 and in optometry offices from 1 cfum3 to 500 cfum3 figure .

eight of the 13 shops analysed were above the threshold recommended in the guidelines for fungal air load 500 cfum3.

from the total of the equipment sampled only three of the 13 shops showed no sign of fungal contamination.regarding the air bacteria load concentrations ranging from 4 cfum3 to 324 cfum3 inclientspatients room and from 8 cfum3 to 276 cfum3 in optometry offices figure  were found.

the presence of bacteria was also detected in every piece of equipment sampled in all of the shops.figure 2. bacteria load present in air and on surfaces from the optical shops assessed.fungal identificationthe fungal diversity present in the samples was characterized based on the morphological features of the colonies table .

we also intend to determine the guidelines and legal compliance of the optical shops assessed contributing to a specific protocol to ensure a proper microbiota and particulate matter assessment.materials and methodsoptical shops assessmenta descriptive study was conducted between october 2015 and march 2016 in a total of 13 optical shops from the lisbon area in portugal.

eye trauma is the cause of fungal keratitis in temperate areas and the common fungal genera involved are fusarium alternaria and aspergillus.
