TBI used to condition patients before they receive adoptive T cell therapy induces mucosal damage and translocation of commensals which through Toll-like receptor 4 TLR4 signalling activate dendritic cells to sustain proliferation and cytotoxic functions of the transferred T cells153.CTX induces immunological cell death of tumour cells which elicits the generation of antitumour pathogenic T helper 17 pTH17 cells TH1 cells and cytotoxicT lymphocytes CTLs CTX also induces damage to the mucosa and translocationof commensal bacteria that activate tumour antigen-presenting dendritic cells enhancing the antitumour immune response6182.

Taconic mice cohoused with JAX mice acquired the same rate of tumour growth antitumour resistance and responsiveness to antiPDL1 as observed in JAX mice152.NATURE REVIEWS  CANCERVOLUME 17  MAY 2017  281REVIEWS The response to antiPDL1 in C57BL6 mice trans planted with the B16.SIY tumours is significantly associated with the relative frequency in the gut microbiota of the Bifidobacterium genus includ ing Bifidobacterium breve Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis152.

In microbiota depleted mice tumourinfiltrating myeloid cells fail to produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to CpGODNs and neither the TNFdependent haemor rhagic necrosis nor the antitumour adaptive immunity are efficiently induced by the treatment62.In tumours of microbiotadepleted mice the total number of infiltrating inflammatory monocytes before treatment is unaltered while the number of monocyte derived Ly6C major histocompatibility complex MHC class II cells is reduced62.

These results suggest that the gut micro biota in part through TLR4 signalling systemically primes myeloid cells including tumourinfiltrating cells for responsiveness to TLR9 a phenomenon that resem bles the 'trained' innate resistance described with various innate effector cell types158.TNF production in response to CpGODNs corre lates both positively and negatively with the frequency of various bacterial genera in the faecal microbiota of mice at the time of the treatment FIG.

An intact and functional gut epithelium maintains a healthy body and gut epithelial homeostasis is maintained by continuous crosstalk between the gut microbiota immune cells and the mucosal barrier20.The composition of the microbiota is shaped by host genetics colonization at the time of birth type of birth delivery an individual's lifestyle incidence of diseases and exposure to antibiotics21-23.

As the gut microbiota has been shown to affect the immune response induced by immunogenic cell death in both chemotherapy and immunotherapy dis cussed below6162119 it can be hypothesized that the gut microbiota also fulfils a role in the immunostimulatory effects of RTX.NATURE REVIEWS  CANCERVOLUME 17  MAY 2017  277REVIEWS TLR4TLR4TLR2TLR1 or TLR6FPR1 or FPR2MYD88TRAMTRIFNLRP3MAL  G GyOxaliplatin or cisplatinPriming of tumour- infiltrating myeloid cells for NOX2-dependent ROS productionLigand MAMPfrom L. acidophilusCpG-ODNPriming of tumour infiltrating myeloid cells for TNF productionLigand LPS A. shaiiNOD2EndosomeTLR3TLR3NucleusAIM2Figure 4  Microbiota-triggered innate immune receptors.

Interestingly although colonization of germ free mice with microbiota taken from conventionally raised mice reestablishes normal gene expression colo nization of germfree mice with the probiotic preparation VSL3 normalizes only a proportion of the genes altered in germfree mice48.

The phenotype of genetically modified mice is not always due to a direct effect of the mutated gene but in some cases is mediated by the presence in the mutated mouse strains of an altered microbiota com position the altered microbiota is responsible for the observed phenotype and can be transmitted by cohousing or faecal transplant to wildtype mice which acquire the same phenotype as the genetically modified mice169170.A microbiota imbalance that in genetically altered mice influences their phenotype is not limited to bacteria but can involve fungi protozoa viruses and reactiva tion of endogenous retroviruses171-176.

Barrier breach ing enables commensal microorganisms and patho gens to access the mesenteric lymph nodes and also the blood circulation leading to septicaemia and systemic inflammation70.274  MAY 2017  VOLUME 17REVIEWS The antitumour effect of oxaliplatin or cisplatin treatment on subcutaneous transplantable tumours is dramatically decreased in germfree mice or in mice in which gut commensals have been depleted by broadspectrum antibiotics62 FIG.
