additional mechanistic studies and rigorous clinical trials are needed to estab lish whether modulation of gut microbiota homeostasis could become an effective clinical approach to treat cancer comorbidities such as anorexia and cachexia as well as cancer therapy adverse events.radiotherapy and microbiotamany cancer patients receive ionizing radiation therapy rtx that is genotoxic for tumour cells and may be cura tive for localized cancers.

in particular the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti bodies against cytotoxic t lymphocyteassociated anti gen 4 ctla4 expressed on activated t effector cells and treg cells and programmed cell death protein 1 pd1 or its ligand pd1 ligand 1 pdl1 have shown strong antitumour activity in experimental animal models and substantial and longlasting clinical efficacy in patients with cancer melanoma renal cell cancer lung cancer and others being tested in ongoing clinical trials162.

this is mediated by the dual acti vation of the innate immune receptor tolllike recepinnate immune receptor formyl peptide receptor 1 fpr1 on dendritic cells not by microbial products but through interaction with the endogenous ligand annexin a1 from dying cancer cells which promotes stable contacts between the dying cancer cells and the dendritic cells79 fig.

tbi used to condition patients before they receive adoptive t cell therapy induces mucosal damage and translocation of commensals which through toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 signalling activate dendritic cells to sustain proliferation and cytotoxic functions of the transferred t cells153.ctx induces immunological cell death of tumour cells which elicits the generation of antitumour pathogenic t helper 17 pth17 cells th1 cells and cytotoxict lymphocytes ctls ctx also induces damage to the mucosa and translocationof commensal bacteria that activate tumour antigen-presenting dendritic cells enhancing the antitumour immune response6182.

taconic mice cohoused with jax mice acquired the same rate of tumour growth antitumour resistance and responsiveness to antipdl1 as observed in jax mice152.nature reviews  cancervolume 17  may 2017  281reviews the response to antipdl1 in c57bl6 mice trans planted with the b16.siy tumours is significantly associated with the relative frequency in the gut microbiota of the bifidobacterium genus includ ing bifidobacterium breve bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium adolescentis152.

an intact and functional gut epithelium maintains a healthy body and gut epithelial homeostasis is maintained by continuous crosstalk between the gut microbiota immune cells and the mucosal barrier20.the composition of the microbiota is shaped by host genetics colonization at the time of birth type of birth delivery an individual's lifestyle incidence of diseases and exposure to antibiotics21-23.

as the gut microbiota has been shown to affect the immune response induced by immunogenic cell death in both chemotherapy and immunotherapy dis cussed below6162119 it can be hypothesized that the gut microbiota also fulfils a role in the immunostimulatory effects of rtx.nature reviews  cancervolume 17  may 2017  277reviews tlr4tlr4tlr2tlr1 or tlr6fpr1 or fpr2myd88tramtrifnlrp3mal  g gyoxaliplatin or cisplatinpriming of tumour- infiltrating myeloid cells for nox2-dependent ros productionligand mampfrom l. acidophiluscpg-odnpriming of tumour infiltrating myeloid cells for tnf productionligand lps a. shaiinod2endosometlr3tlr3nucleusaim2figure 4  microbiota-triggered innate immune receptors.

4. these results suggest that the gut micro biota in part through tlr4 signalling systemically primes myeloid cells including tumourinfiltrating cells for responsiveness to tlr9 a phenomenon that resem bles the 'trained' innate resistance described with various innate effector cell types158.tnf production in response to cpgodns corre lates both positively and negatively with the frequency of various bacterial genera in the faecal microbiota of mice at the time of the treatment fig.

in microbiota depleted mice tumourinfiltrating myeloid cells fail to produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to cpgodns and neither the tnfdependent haemor rhagic necrosis nor the antitumour adaptive immunity are efficiently induced by the treatment62.in tumours of microbiotadepleted mice the total number of infiltrating inflammatory monocytes before treatment is unaltered while the number of monocyte derived ly6c major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii cells is reduced62.

experimental mouse tumour models using transplantable cell lines chemical carcinogenesis or genetically modified mice have been instrumental in major advances in immune cancer therapy and in the detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy yet they fail to fully reproduce the features of spontaneous human tumours167.

thus the heterogeneity of response to drug therapy and susceptibility to toxic effects in can cer patients may be due at least in part to differences in gut microbiota composition and activity between individual patients50.in addition to oral drugs injected drugs are also in part firstly metabolized in the liver before biliary excretion into the gut where they are exposed to the gut microbiota and can be further metabolized and reabsorbed fig.

gut microbes define liver cancer risk in mice exposed to chemical and viral transgenic hepatocarcinogens.

the anti tumour activity of ctx in tumourbearing mice induces alteration of the gut mucosa within 1-2 days with increased mucosal permeability and transloca tion of gut bacteria into the mesenteric lymph nodes61.
