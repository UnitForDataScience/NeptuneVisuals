show that Hadza gut microbial diversity was higher in the dry season than in the wet season.

The overall diversity of carbohydrate enzymes was greater and the abundance of animal carbohydrate enzymes higher during the dry season as compared to the wet season.

Using a new methodology they identify operational taxonomic units OTUs--clus- ters of reads that are a proxy for taxons--that respond to seasonal changes in diet activity and the external environment thereby main- taining a healthy gut.Owing to changes in lifestyle the compo- sition of human gut microbiota has evolved from hunter-gatherer societies to rural communities to industrialized Western countries.

For example several taxa present in the Hadza gut--such as members of the phy- lum Spirochaetes--are undetectable or have very small relative abundance in the guts of people in modern societies.

By contrast Actinobacteria--a phylum that is prominent in the guts of people in modern societies and that includes the genus Bifidobacterium--is barely detectable in the Hadza gut.

6 demonstratedwith season.

Focus- ing on the two major phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes they found that the same Firmicutes OTUs were present in multiple seasons whereas the number of Bacteroide- tes OTUs was substantially reduced from dry to wet season.

The most notable finding is a substantial reduction in the number of OTUs belonging to the Prevotellaceae fam- ily within Bacteroidetes from the dry to the wet season.
