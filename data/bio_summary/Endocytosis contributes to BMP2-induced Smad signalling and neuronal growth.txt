To assess the dynamin-dependent endocytosis inhibition efficiency of dynasore SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in 30 ugml of Alexa594- transferrin Invitrogen as previously described in a separate study Immunocytochemistry and measurement of cellular morphologyImmunocytochemistry and measurement of cellular morphol- ogy were performed as previously described Cultures were incubated in the following antibodies BMPRII 1200 RD Sys-tems BMPRIb 1200 RD Systems Smad 158 1200 Cell Signalling or phopsho-Smad 158 1200 Cell Signalling.Statistical analysisUnpaired Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey's test or simple linear regression were performed and con- sidered significant when p  0.05.ResultsDynasore inhibits dynamin-dependent endocytosis in SH-SY5Y cellsFirstly immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate that SH-SY5Y cells express both type I and type II BMPRs a as well as Smad 158 transcription factors b and can therefore initiate BMPR-Smad 158 signalling in response to BMP ligands.

To test the ability of dynasore to inhibit endocyto- sis uptake of fluorescently-labelled transferrin was examined as a measurement of endocytosis Uptake of Alexa594-transferrin was inhibited following treatment with dynasore for 2 h a- c. Dynasore treatment did not affect cell numbers compared to the control d. These findings demonstrate that dynasore inhibits endocytosis in SH-SY5Y cells.The activation temporal kinetics and magnitude of BMP2-induced Smad 158 signalling in SH-SY5Y cells are regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosisWe next investigated the effect of dynasore on the activation temporal kinetics and magnitude of Smad signalling induced by BMP2 in SH-SY5Y cells.

found that while saturation of BMPR binding limits the ini- tial BMP2 uptake within the first hour of treatment more binding sites subsequently appear at the plasma membrane enabling an increase in BMP2 endocytosis over time In addition to this dorsomorphin a small molecular inhibitor of BMPRI signif- icantly reduces BMP2-BMPR endocytosis for up to 8 h Such a mechanism may have contributed to dorsomorphin-induced inhi- bition of BMP2-induced activation of the Smad 158 signalling pathway at 15 and 60 min in SH-SY5Y cells which was observed in our previous study Furthermore dorsomorphin also inhibited BMP2-induced neurite growth in SH-SY5Y cells This may have been due at least in part to dorsomorphin-mediated short-term inhibition of BMP2-BMPR endocytosis In the current study early and short-term inhibition of endocytosis treatment with dynasore for initial 4 h was sufficient to significantly inhibit the neurite-growth-promoting effects of BMP2.Dynamin-dependent endocytosis thus appears to be requiredduring the initial phase of BMP2 stimulation in order for this fac- tor to exert its maximal effect on neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells.

a Schematic representation showing that BMP2-activated BMPR signalling results in increased phosphorylation of Smad 158 phospho-Smad 158 immunocytochemistry for which is shown in SH-SY5Y cells in the representative photomicrographs in d.Linear regression showing a significant correlation between time of exposure to BMP2 and nuclear phospho-Smad 158 levels.

This result is not surprising considering that inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis affects the activation kinetics and magnitude of BMP2-induced Smad 158 signalling which is known to drive SH-SY5Y neurite growth Collectively these data indicate a requirement for dynamin-dependent endo- cytosis in BMP2-induced neurite growth in SH-SY5Y cells.

Treatment with BMP2 resulted in a significant increase in the total length of neurites and axonal branching of the SH-SY5Y cells Similarly SH-SY5Y cells treated with dynasore and BMP2 had significantly longer neurites when compared to the control a b.

Collectively these findings show that dynamin-dependent endocytosis plays a role in BMP2-induced neurite growth.DiscussionBMP2 is a neurotrophic factor that regulates the neurite growth of VM DA neurons in vitro and in vivo and this effect has been shown to be dependent on BMPRIb activation of canoni- cal Smad signalling The present study aimed to build on these findings by investigating the contribution of endocytosis to the reg- ulation of BMP2-induced Smad signalling and neurite growth in the human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line a widely used model of human midbrain DA neurons In order to achieve this we inhibited dynamin-dependent endo- cytosis using the small molecule dynasore an approach which was validated by measuring tranferrin uptake into the SH-SY5Y cells.

Significant increases in phospho-Smad 158 levels were only detected after 30 min rather than from 5 min onwards c d. Dynasore pre-treatment also signifi- cantly reduced the magnitude of BMP2-induced Smad signalling at 60 min d. Taken together these data demonstrate that activation of Smad signalling by BMP2 is regulated by dynamin- dependent endocytosis in SH-SY5Y cells.Fig.
