This situation in M. circinelloides revealed a unique RNA inhibition RNAi-dependent epimutation mechanism that confers tran- sient FK506 resistance  but in Malassezia this phenomenon can be excluded due to the lack of RNAi components  thus FK506 resistance in this uncharacterized isolate may be due to mutations affecting genes encoding components of multidrug efflux pumps or other mechanisms.Due to the isolation of calcineurin inhibitor-resistant isolates of M. sympodialis with genetic mutations in homopolymer repeats  we hypothesized that we could generate an M. sympodialis hypermutator strain defective in the replication of these specific sequences and score the expected increase in the mutational rate using the drug FK506.

In contrast for the drug combination the MIC was 0.78 ugml for FK506 1.56 ugml for ascomycin3.125 ugml for pimecrolimus and 0.625 ugml for FLC with the resulting fractional inhibitory concentration FIC index being 0.508 0.516 and 0.531 respectively indi- cating additive activity .Interestingly the fkb1D mutant of M. sympodialis showed the same sensitivity to FLC as the WT strain MIC of 1.25 ugml and as expected it displayed full resistance to calcineurin inhibitors alone at all of the concentrations tested with less than 10 ofFIG 4 Deletion of the FKB1 gene of M. sympodialis confers resistance to FK506.

As expected the fkb1D mutants displayed full resistance to FK506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus  and  indicating the highly conserved role of FKBP12 across eukaryotic organisms  .We found that the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus act additively with fluconazole FLC versus M. sympodialis ATCC 42312 and that this mechanism is mediated by FKBP12 and thus mediated by calcineurin.

We found that in all cases a temperature of 37degC was required for FK506 toxicity against both M. furfur and M. sympodialis while the presence of LiCl ledto different phenotypic responses among the strains tested it was essential for clear toxicity of FK506 against M. furfur CBS 14141  and M. sympodialis CBS 7222 Fig.

For qualitative assays aiming at assessing the FK506 resistance rate in the WT M. sympodialis ATCC 42132 strain and the derived msh2D mutant four independent colonies of each strain were resuspended in 200 ul of liquid mDixon medium and then swabbed onto mDixon agar plus 15 mM LiCl with FK506 25 ugml or without FK506 the plates were incubated at 37degC for 5 to 8 days.

Paradoxically the MIC of the calcineurin inhibitors in combination with FLC was higher for the fkb1D mutant than forTABLE 2 FK506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus are additive when combined with fluconazole against M. sympodialis in an FKBP12- dependent fashionaaFLC fluconazole Asco ascomycin Pime pimecrolimus.the wild type of M. sympodialis however this was simply due to the toxicity of FLC at a higher dilution in the checkerboard assay i.e.

Based on the model built the lysine at the 76th residue is less likely to interact directly with FK506 however in the SR3FIG 5 Combined activity of calcineurin inhibitors FK506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus with FLC against the M. sympodialis ATCC 42132 WT strain and the derived fkb1D mutant.

Overall the predicted models indicated that the amino acid alterations in the FKBP12 protein are less likely to affect the interaction between calcineurin AB subunits and the FKBP12-FK506 complex but rather they affect the interactions between FKBP12 and FK506 or the stability of FKBP12.An M. sympodialis msh2a hypermutator exhibits an elevated rate of evolution of resistance to FK506 compared to the wild type.

The different results obtained by Sugita and colleagues  might be due to different experimental conditions used medium and temperature different strain backgrounds tested strain names are not available in reference  or different azoles the last being supported by previous findings in pathogenic zygomycetes in which combinations of posaconazole and itraconazole with FK506 increase fungicidal activity by inducing cell apoptosis whereas FK506 combined with FLC had no relevant effect .From a clinical viewpoint although the topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus FK506 Protopic and pimecrolimus Elidel are available in the clinic as alternative to corticosteroids to treat inflammatory skin conditions our microbiological drug assays revealed that a practical limitation to their use is that their maximum toxicity is exertedat 37degC while human skin temperature is on average 32degC to 34degC .

Multiple alignments of the human and fungal FKBP12 proteins  allowed the prediction of the classical -sheets a-helixes and loop regions of the M. sympodialis FKBP12 and the regions impacted by nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions .Structural homology modeling of the M. sympodialis FKBP12-FK506 calcineurin complex and analysis of the FK506-resistant isolates combined with FKBP12 protein analysis revealed how these changes within the FKBP12 sequence affected the overall structure of the calcineurin inhibitory complex.
