this situation in m. circinelloides revealed a unique rna inhibition rnai-dependent epimutation mechanism that confers tran- sient fk506 resistance  but in malassezia this phenomenon can be excluded due to the lack of rnai components  thus fk506 resistance in this uncharacterized isolate may be due to mutations affecting genes encoding components of multidrug efflux pumps or other mechanisms.due to the isolation of calcineurin inhibitor-resistant isolates of m. sympodialis with genetic mutations in homopolymer repeats  we hypothesized that we could generate an m. sympodialis hypermutator strain defective in the replication of these specific sequences and score the expected increase in the mutational rate using the drug fk506.

in contrast for the drug combination the mic was 0.78 ugml for fk506 1.56 ugml for ascomycin3.125 ugml for pimecrolimus and 0.625 ugml for flc with the resulting fractional inhibitory concentration fic index being 0.508 0.516 and 0.531 respectively indi- cating additive activity .interestingly the fkb1d mutant of m. sympodialis showed the same sensitivity to flc as the wt strain mic of 1.25 ugml and as expected it displayed full resistance to calcineurin inhibitors alone at all of the concentrations tested with less than 10 offig 4 deletion of the fkb1 gene of m. sympodialis confers resistance to fk506.

as expected the fkb1d mutants displayed full resistance to fk506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus  and  indicating the highly conserved role of fkbp12 across eukaryotic organisms  .we found that the calcineurin inhibitors fk506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus act additively with fluconazole flc versus m. sympodialis atcc 42312 and that this mechanism is mediated by fkbp12 and thus mediated by calcineurin.

mutations were found in the 2-sheet y27d in the 40s loop d39g in the 4-sheet l76s and c78r and in the 5-sheet l99r l105r .next a projected m. sympodialis model of the calcineurin complex inhibited by fkbp12-fk506 was built using swiss-model  based on homology with the amino acid sequences of the calcineurin a and b subunits and with fkbp12 constructed based on a crystal structure of the coccidioides immitis fk506-inhibited calcineurin complex seattle structural genomics center for infectious disease ssgcid et al.

multiple alignments of the human and fungal fkbp12 proteins  allowed the prediction of the classical -sheets a-helixes and loop regions of the m. sympodialis fkbp12 and the regions impacted by nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions .structural homology modeling of the m. sympodialis fkbp12-fk506 calcineurin complex and analysis of the fk506-resistant isolates combined with fkbp12 protein analysis revealed how these changes within the fkbp12 sequence affected the overall structure of the calcineurin inhibitory complex.

at present this warning still remains and despite the number of studies that demonstrate no correlation with malignancy a critical review by siegfried and colleagues highlighted the lack of information for long-term therapy based on calcineurin inhibitors and hence their use for inflammatory dermatitis is recommended for only intermittent periods of time .the mechanism of action of calcineurin inhibitors has been extensively investigated revealing that these drugs bind to peptidyl-propyl cis-trans isomerase immunophilins-- fk506 binds fkbp12 and cyclosporine binds cyclophilin a--to form complexes that bind calcineurin and inhibit its activity .

two other drugs that target mtor mechanistic target of rapamycin or calcineurin rapamycin and cyclosporine respectively showed no or low toxicityfig 1 the calcineurin inhibitor fk506 displays antifungal activity against m. furfur and m. sympodialis.

paradoxically the mic of the calcineurin inhibitors in combination with flc was higher for the fkb1d mutant than fortable 2 fk506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus are additive when combined with fluconazole against m. sympodialis in an fkbp12- dependent fashionaaflc fluconazole asco ascomycin pime pimecrolimus.the wild type of m. sympodialis however this was simply due to the toxicity of flc at a higher dilution in the checkerboard assay i.e.

based on the model built the lysine at the 76th residue is less likely to interact directly with fk506 however in the sr3fig 5 combined activity of calcineurin inhibitors fk506 ascomycin and pimecrolimus with flc against the m. sympodialis atcc 42132 wt strain and the derived fkb1d mutant.

overall the predicted models indicated that the amino acid alterations in the fkbp12 protein are less likely to affect the interaction between calcineurin ab subunits and the fkbp12-fk506 complex but rather they affect the interactions between fkbp12 and fk506 or the stability of fkbp12.an m. sympodialis msh2a hypermutator exhibits an elevated rate of evolution of resistance to fk506 compared to the wild type.

we found that in all cases a temperature of 37degc was required for fk506 toxicity against both m. furfur and m. sympodialis while the presence of licl ledto different phenotypic responses among the strains tested it was essential for clear toxicity of fk506 against m. furfur cbs 14141  and m. sympodialis cbs 7222 fig.

for qualitative assays aiming at assessing the fk506 resistance rate in the wt m. sympodialis atcc 42132 strain and the derived msh2d mutant four independent colonies of each strain were resuspended in 200 ul of liquid mdixon medium and then swabbed onto mdixon agar plus 15 mm licl with fk506 25 ugml or without fk506 the plates were incubated at 37degc for 5 to 8 days.

the different results obtained by sugita and colleagues  might be due to different experimental conditions used medium and temperature different strain backgrounds tested strain names are not available in reference  or different azoles the last being supported by previous findings in pathogenic zygomycetes in which combinations of posaconazole and itraconazole with fk506 increase fungicidal activity by inducing cell apoptosis whereas fk506 combined with flc had no relevant effect .from a clinical viewpoint although the topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus fk506 protopic and pimecrolimus elidel are available in the clinic as alternative to corticosteroids to treat inflammatory skin conditions our microbiological drug assays revealed that a practical limitation to their use is that their maximum toxicity is exertedat 37degc while human skin temperature is on average 32degc to 34degc .

a and b cells of m. furfur cbs 14141 and m. sympodialis atcc 42132 were grown on mdixon medium alone or supplemented with 5 mm 10 mm 13 mm only for m. furfur or 15 mm licl and exposed to disks containing 0 vehicle dmso 25 ug 50 ug and 75 ug of fk506.against the m. furfur and m. sympodialis strains used in the present study data not shown.for the following experiments m. furfur cbs 14141 and m. sympodialis atcc 42132 strains were utilized for several reasons.

s4.additive activity of calcineurin inhibitors and fluconazole is dependent on fkbp12 and calcineurin in m. sympodialis.
