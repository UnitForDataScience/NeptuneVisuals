The number of mushrooms identified to date represents only 10 of total mushrooms assumed to exist .

The exact role of the active constituents of some mushrooms are not yet documented and in the future a detailed research on the same would add more knowledge to the existing idea regarding the role of mushrooms in gut microbiota regulation and imparting health benefits.As we saw earlier microbiota play a significant role in human health and disease often they are referred to as the forgotten organ.

The use of mushrooms dates back to the ancient Egyptians and ancient Chinese cultures to promote general health and longevity.

The early record of the Materia Medica shows evidence of using mushrooms for treating diseases.

The average ergosterol content was 1.98 mgg the average vitamin D2 content was 16.88 ugg and vitamin B2 content was 12.68 ugg in 35 different mushrooms.

The PC group Qingyilidan granule is the standard compared with the three different doses of IOP .Coriolus versicolorLike other mushrooms Coriolus is also rich in polysaccharides and used as traditional medicine to treat cancer AIDS and some fungal infections.

The medicinal mushrooms can act as immunomodulatory agents to activate gut microbiota.

The current review discusses the important areas in mushrooms regulated gut microbiota in the host's health.
