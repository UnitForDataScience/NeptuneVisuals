in addition the gvb can afford to be less stringent than the bbb because the first intestinal barrier is provided by the epithelial layer that directly faces the intestinal lumen.another degree of complexity is created by the influ- ence of the environment on the barriers -- for example the interplay between the microbiota and the intestinal barriers fig.

cell 167 1469-1480 2016. this study shows the functional role of the intestinal microbiota in promoting a-synucle-in-mediated brain pathology and motor deficits in a mouse model of parkinson disease.interestingly transplantation of faecal microorganisms from patients with parkinson disease into mice is shown to be sufficient to impair motor functions.erny d. et al.

the use of experimental mouse models together with genomics metagenomics and metabolomics has shed light on the mechanisms that underlie barrier development and maintenance and has highlighted the role of the intestinal microbiota in shaping the properties of the intestinal and brain barriers.

indeed intestinal microorganisms can influ- ence angiogenesis1314 modulate intestinal function15 shape bbb properties and influence behaviour16-19.

3a.the second intestinal barrier -- the gut-vascular bar- rier gvb -- is composed of the intestinal endothelium which actively blocks haematogenous bacterial dis- semination5.

a  the intestinal epithelial barrier ieb is the first layer of defence that prevents the uncontrolled translocation of commensal bacteria from the intestinal lumen into the lamina propria.

it is established by at least two mechanisms a passive physical restriction of leukocyte access across vascular barriers such as the blood-brain barrier bbb89 and an active mechanism that involves immune-regulatory processes such as those at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid csf interface and the intestinal epithelial barrier ieb that ensure the skewing of immune cells towards a regulatory phenotype.in this review we broaden the model of immune gates proposed by shechter et al.10 and highlight the role of the intestine in establishing immune privilege both in the intestine and in other tissues.
