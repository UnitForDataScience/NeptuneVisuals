This study shows the functional role of the intestinal microbiota in promoting a-synucle-in-mediated brain pathology and motor deficits in a mouse model of Parkinson disease.Interestingly transplantation of faecal microorganisms from patients with Parkinson disease into mice is shown to be sufficient to impair motor functions.Erny D. et al.

In addition the GVB can afford to be less stringent than the BBB because the first intestinal barrier is provided by the epithelial layer that directly faces the intestinal lumen.Another degree of complexity is created by the influ- ence of the environment on the barriers -- for example the interplay between the microbiota and the intestinal barriers FIG.
