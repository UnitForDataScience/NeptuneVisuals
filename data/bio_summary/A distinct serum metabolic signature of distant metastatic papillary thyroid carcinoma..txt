201787844-852.1  INTRODUCTION When compared with previous epidemiologic data the incidence rate of thyroid cancer appears to have begun stabilizing in recent years mainly due to the acceptance of more conservative guidelines regarding thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment.1 As the most com- mon subtype papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC can be the predom- inant contribution to this change.

GroupingAfter radioiodine treatment patients diagnosed with distant metasta- sis were assigned into experimental group distant metastasis group while patients with no evidence of disease were included into control group ablation group--no evidence of disease in this study.

Researchers found palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically boosted the metastatic potential of CD36 metastasis-initiating cells in a CD36-dependent manner.27 These re- sults give the evidence that daily diet could affect tumour develop- mentprogression in cancer patients and also provide new potential therapeutic options like lipids limitation regarding distant metastatic disease.Invasion and migration abilities are essential for tumour metasta- sis.28 Gamma-Aminobutyric acid GABA is synthesized predominantlyRT retention time FC fold change FC with a positive value indicates a relatively higher expression level in distant metastasis group whereas a negative value means a relatively lower expression level as compared to the ablation group VIP variable importance in the projection.from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase GAD and exerts its ef- fects via ionotropic GABAA and metabotropic GABAB receptors.29 Studies have reported that GABA and its receptors could take part in the oncogenesismetastasis of various carcinomas.30-32 However the results are controversial because GABA might result in the different effects on cancer proliferationmetastasis in a cancer-type andor GABA receptor-type-dependent manner.

In thyroid cancer Roberts et al35 reported that GABA receptor expression was increased in tumours compared to normal thyroid tissue and they concluded GABAergic system was involved in thyroid carcinogenesis.

Consequently syn- thesization of asparagine is increased to regulating cellular adaptation to glutamine depletion.It is well known that most normal human cells derive the ma- jority of lipid molecules from the diet through blood circulation ei- ther in the form of free fatty acids or lipoproteins while cancer cells seem to prefer de novo synthesis of fatty acids.26 The results of our study showed that all the serum lipids including free fatty acids and phospholipids were significantly decreased in the distant metastasis group when compared to ablation group.

Thirdly as TSH is a major growth factor and stimulator for differentiated thyroid carcinoma cells there could be a possibility for increased TSH levels by in- duced hypothyroidism to have influences on metabolomics profile results.In conclusions although the incidence rate for thyroid cancer seems to have begun stabilizing in recent years increased rate of advanced stage of this disease has been reported.40 And it is well known that dis- tant metastasis is the most essential prognostic factor in patients with PTC.
