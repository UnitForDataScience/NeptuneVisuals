biotinylation is an epigenetic pro- cess in which gene expression is repressed by covalent attachment of biotin on histone h2a at k9 k13 k125 k127 and k12 on histone h3 at k4 k9 and k18 and on histone h4 at k8 and k12.

in another study decreased expression of fmr1 fragile x mental retardation 1 gene due to methylation of existing cpg residues in the promoter region was observed in a human lymphoblastoid cell line when a surplus amount of folic acid was added to cells.in a mouse model of neural tube defects folate consumption by mothers res- cued neural tube defects by decreasing h3k27 methyla- tion marks in the hes1 and neurog2 gene promoters associated with neural tube development.mice fed folic acid during gestation showed substantial alter- ations in the methylation patterns of cpg and non- cpg sites of key developmental genes which altered gene expression in cerebral hemispheres and thus influenced overall development.long-term supple- mentation with folic acid and vitamin b12 in elderly in- dividuals altered the genome-wide dna methylation of several genes implicated in normal developmental proc- esses and carcinogenesis.folate via mirna alterations also modulates the gene expression profile of cells.

second it examines the potential effect of gut microbes and their secondary metabolitesnutrients on the epigenome via epigenetic modification and rna interference.reprogramming of the epigenome by the gut microbiotachromatin undergoes sequence-independent epigenetic modifications like dna methylation histone acetyl- ation phosphorylation biotinylation and rna inter- ference all of which turn genes on and off without changing their original sequence.

therefore mechan- isms of chromatin uncoiling and recoiling that are acti- vated by the addition and removal of specific chemical groups known as epigenetic marks are thought toregulate chromatin architecture which influences gene expression in response to environmental factors.the methylated dna acetylated proteins micro rna mirna specific substrates cofactors and en- zymes involved in various biochemical reactions associ- ated with epigenomic processes could serve as biomarkers for detecting the progression of various dis- eases.recently it has been established that various infectious agents like epstein-barr virus hepatitis viruses b and c human papilloma virus polyomavi- ruses streptococcus bovis chlamydia pneumoniae campylobacter rectus helicobacter pylori and others in- duce changes at the epigenetic level that result in the onset and progression of certain diseases.similarly the global dna methylation patterns associated with greater susceptibility to cardiovascular disease as a re- sult of abnormal lipid metabolism and inflammatory re- sponses have been linked to a microbiome dominated by bacteria in the phyla firmicutes.

first it highlights the role of various enzymes associated with epigenetic changes such as histone acetyltransferases hats histone deacetylases hdacs dna methyl- transferases dnmts and kinases.

however the mechanisms of mirna action are yet to be fully established and the association between mirnas and cellular processes at the molecular level during health and disease has not been explored.microbial metabolites potent epigenetic modulatersthe endogenous gut microbiota produces diet- dependent low-molecular-weight compounds such as vitamins and scfa polyamines  as well as diet-independent products such as lps gram-negative cell wall component and peptidoglycan gram-positive cell wall component within the intestinal micro- environment.these commensal bacterially derivedby-products especially butyrate serve as the primary source of nourishment for colonocytes and are able to maintain their normal phenotype and cellular homeo- stasis.these metabolites also modify the epigenome of host cells and the epigenetic changes in turn alter the development and functions of the cell as well as regulate gene expressionthroughout life of an individ- ual .-short-chain fatty acidsof the microbial metabolites scfas have received con- siderable attention because of their predominantly beneficial effects.

for example epigenetic alterations which are critical for fear memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala of rats may occur through histone acetylation and dna methyla- tion.in addition an increase in histone h3 acetyl- ation and dnmt3a expression in the lateral amygdala caused auditory fear conditioning.

thus because they can induce epigenetic changes in host cells vitamins pro- duced by the gut microbiota play a highly significant role in modulating the host gene expression profile.probiotics and epigenetic changesprobiotics are live microorganisms that when ingested enhance the health of an individual.

gut microbe metabolites such as scfas polyamines and polyphenols can change the host cellu- lar levels of important epigenetic modifiers like hats hdacs dnmts dna demethylases histone methyl- tranferases histone demethylases kinases and mirna.

dna methylation is generally associated with the suppression of gene tran- scription whereas histone methylation may mediate either transcription activation or transcription repression depending on which amino acid residue of histone is methylated.

in neural stem cells the histone methyl- transferase ezh2 which suppresses gene transcription via trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 is also downregulated by mir-101 and mir-137 via comple- mentary binding with the 30-utr region.similarly hdac1 which is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancers is downregulated by mir-449a in pros- tate cancer cells.

the feeding of mice with bifidobacterium lactis lkm512- enriched chow increases intestinal polyamine concentra- tions which inhibits colonic senescence and enhances longevity in mice.moreover long-term oral adminis- tration of the same probiotic strain lkm512 together with arginine suppressed inflammation improved lon- gevity and protected from age-induced memory impair- ment in mice and thus may prevent aging-related deterioration in quality of life via the upregulation of polyamines.polyamines appear to be critical for main- tenance of intestinal health and thus are essential target molecules whose mechanism of action while thought to be via epigenetic reprogramming is still being elucidated.interdependence between key epigenetic modifiers and composition of thegut microbiotanot only does the microbiota influence the activities of intestinal hdacs but in turn the intestinal hdacs alter the composition of gut microbiota.
