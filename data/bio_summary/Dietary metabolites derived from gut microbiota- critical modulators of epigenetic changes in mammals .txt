In another study decreased expression of FMR1 fragile X mental retardation 1 gene due to methylation of existing CpG residues in the promoter region was observed in a human lymphoblastoid cell line when a surplus amount of folic acid was added to cells.In a mouse model of neural tube defects folate consumption by mothers res- cued neural tube defects by decreasing H3K27 methyla- tion marks in the Hes1 and Neurog2 gene promoters associated with neural tube development.Mice fed folic acid during gestation showed substantial alter- ations in the methylation patterns of CpG and non- CpG sites of key developmental genes which altered gene expression in cerebral hemispheres and thus influenced overall development.Long-term supple- mentation with folic acid and vitamin B12 in elderly in- dividuals altered the genome-wide DNA methylation of several genes implicated in normal developmental proc- esses and carcinogenesis.Folate via miRNA alterations also modulates the gene expression profile of cells.

Biotinylation is an epigenetic pro- cess in which gene expression is repressed by covalent attachment of biotin on histone H2A at K9 K13 K125 K127 and K12 on histone H3 at K4 K9 and K18 and on histone H4 at K8 and K12.

The binding of Ago1 and RNA polymerase II also induced cyclin B1 expression.The expression of these small molecules also called biological microprocessors is heavily dependent on the gut microbial community.The colonization of germ- free mice by members of a normal microbiota changes the expression of miRNA in both the ileum and the colon which ultimately modulates host gene expres- sion.Among a large number of genes studied Abcc3 a multidrug resistance gene was identified as a highly likely target of mmu-miR-665 miRNA which downre- gulated Abcc3 mRNA and proteins levels by targeting the 30-UTR region.

Lysine histone demethylases KDMs numbered from KDM1 to KDM6 also demethylate spe- cific lysine residues by involving Fe2th2- oxoglurate 2-OG during their catatysis and can either activate or repress gene expression.Methylation and demethyla- tion are both reversible and are involved in genesuppression and activation respectively in a wide var- iety of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Commensal gut microbes are reported to change the methylation pattern of epithelial cells and thus may modulate cellular functioning.

RelA after nuclear transport binds to the IL-6 gene promoter and in- creases both acetylation of H3K9 and phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3 which results in enhancedIL-6 expression.The gut microbiota via phosphoryl- ation may also change the expression of nonhistone cytosolic proteins such as tissue factor as confirmed by in vivo trials.

DNA methylation is generally associated with the suppression of gene tran- scription whereas histone methylation may mediate either transcription activation or transcription repression depending on which amino acid residue of histone is methylated.
