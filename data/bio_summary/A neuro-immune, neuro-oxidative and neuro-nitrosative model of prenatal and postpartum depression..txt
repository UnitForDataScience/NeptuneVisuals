right column summarizes the pregnancy-spe- cific changes in the 6 different IO  NS pathways.IO  NS pathways in prenatal depressionNeuro-immune pathways in prenatal depressionIn the early puerperium increased levels of IL-6 and IL-6R con- centrations are associated with increased self-reported levels of de- pression while increased serum IL-6 and IL-1RA coupled with lowered LIF-R levels are associated with self-reported anxiety  .

Immune activation may impact the pathophysiology of a meaningful subset of depression presentations as indicated by different neuro-im- mune pathways which along with O  NS contribute to a deteriorating course of recurrent presentations a process referred to as neuropro- gression   .Alterations in the serotonergic system including a decrease in the serotonin precursor tryptophan have classically been linked toTable 1Pregnancy-specific changes in 6 neuro-immune neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative pathways and their respective biomarkers which may be involved in prenatal and postnatal depression.PathwaysRelevant biomarkers as assessed in perinatal depression researchPregnancy-specific changesNeuro-immuneC-reactive protein Haptoglobin ZincCytokines ChemokinesCC16 uteroglobulin LIF-receptorTryptophan cataboliteTryptophan TRYCATsIgA and IgM responses directed to the TRYCAT pathwayNeuro-oxidativeAOPPZinc TRAP SH-groupsOmega-3 polyunsatutared fatty acidsPregnancy new set point between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanismsEarly puerperium a more pro-inflammatory state with decreased anti-inflammatory potentialPregnancy TRYCAT pathway activity is enhancedEarly puerperium further increase in immune-stimulated TRYCAT pathway activityPregnancy activated neuro-oxidative pathways with elevated protein oxidation at the expense of lowered peroxide levels and lowered antioxidant levels including zinc and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acidsNeuro-nitrosativeNOx productionPregnancy increased NO production but no changes in nitration or nitrosylation of proteinsGut-immune-brainIgAIgM responses to antigensLPS of Gram-negative commensal bacteria MicrobiomeNatural autoimmuneIgM responses to MDA and other oxidative specific epitopesIgM responses to NO-adductsPregnancy lowered indices of bacterial translocation and thus increased protection against leaky gut probably by increased progesterone and estrogen levelsPregnancy lowered IgM responses to MDA reflecting attenuated regulatory responses thereby contributing to activated neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative pathwaysIgM responses to MDA and NO may negatively regulate depressive symptomsLIF leukemia inhibitory factor.TRYCATs tryptophan catabolites.AOPP advanced oxidation protein products.

Therefore lowered IgM responses to MDA at the end of term are probably accompanied by lowered feedback on AOPP and NOx production and thus increased protein oxidation and nitrosylation leading to more antenatal depres- sive symptoms.Interestingly IgM responses to NO-adducts were significantly and positively related to increased NOx levels indicating that measurements of IgM responses to NO-adducts reflect increased NO production and nitrosylation.

reported that increased L-tryptophan breakdown and increased kynur- enine levels in the postpartum period do not occur in women with postpartum depression and that kynurenine is significantly lower in patients with postpartum depression .Using a new assay to measure TRYCAT pathway activity namelyIgA and IgM responses to TRYCATs we could not verify that TRYCAT pathway activity at the end of term is associated with prenatal de- pression or postpartum depressive symptoms.

The inverse association between lowered levels of eSH groups and prenatal depressive symptoms may be explained by increased use of eSH groups for nitrosothiol SNO synthesis while the inverse association between peroxides and de- pressive symptoms may be explained by increased use of peroxides during AOPP synthesis and inhibition of peroxides by AOPP   .

Finally during late pregnancy when the fetus is prompt to be delivered immune cells influx into the myometrium in order to promote an inflammatory re- sponse  promoting uterine contractions birth of the baby placental rejection and defense against puerperal sepsis  .End of term pregnancy is accompanied by increased serum levels of IL-6 IL-1RA leukemia inhibitory factor receptor LIF-R and increased CRP but lowered zinc levels  .

Studies demon- strate an association of LPS exposure and increased maternal serum corticosterone IL-1b levels injury to placental tissue and increased rate of pregnancy loss  .Pregnancy is accompanied by lowered translocation of Gram-ne-gative bacteria and thus lowered gut permeability as indicated by sig- nificantly decreased levels of IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria suggesting that pregnant women could be protected against the devel- opment of a 'leaky' gut .

During pregnancy lowered levels of IgM-mediated auto-immune responses to MDA are inversely related to increased AOPP and NOx levels indicating that these IgM responses exert negative feedback on increased nitro-oxidative stress.
