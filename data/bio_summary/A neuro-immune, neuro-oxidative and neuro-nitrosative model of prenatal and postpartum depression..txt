increased aopp levels at the end of term are as- sociated with lowered cord length and an increased risk for caesarian section whereas lowered pon1 activity at the end of term is associated with increased labor duration and neonatal problems including more night time awakenings and sucking problems in the early neonatal period  in press.

therefore lowered igm responses to mda at the end of term are probably accompanied by lowered feedback on aopp and nox production and thus increased protein oxidation and nitrosylation leading to more antenatal depres- sive symptoms.interestingly igm responses to no-adducts were significantly and positively related to increased nox levels indicating that measurements of igm responses to no-adducts reflect increased no production and nitrosylation.

reported that increased l-tryptophan breakdown and increased kynur- enine levels in the postpartum period do not occur in women with postpartum depression and that kynurenine is significantly lower in patients with postpartum depression .using a new assay to measure trycat pathway activity namelyiga and igm responses to trycats we could not verify that trycat pathway activity at the end of term is associated with prenatal de- pression or postpartum depressive symptoms.

the inverse association between lowered levels of esh groups and prenatal depressive symptoms may be explained by increased use of esh groups for nitrosothiol sno synthesis while the inverse association between peroxides and de- pressive symptoms may be explained by increased use of peroxides during aopp synthesis and inhibition of peroxides by aopp   .

during pregnancy lowered levels of igm-mediated auto-immune responses to mda are inversely related to increased aopp and nox levels indicating that these igm responses exert negative feedback on increased nitro-oxidative stress.

an- other study however did not find a significant association between prenatal depression and increased igm levels although there were higher levels of igg among pregnant women with major depression than those with minor depression .

the most important indicators of o  ns asso- ciated with prenatal depression were increased aopp and nox in- dicating protein oxidation and increased no production leading to ni- trosative and nitro-oxidative stress.

this indicates that increased nitrosylation may be a trait marker of depression and bipolar disorder and that increased auto- immune responses to no adducts may be protective against prenatal depressive symptoms.

in conclusion our findings suggest that pregnancy may protect against bacterial translo- cation and that end of term mucosa-derived immune responses to gram-negative bacteria may contribute to immune activation.natural autoimmune igm responses to mdano-adducts in prenatal depressionpregnant women show increased thyroperoxidase antibodies which are significantly associated with prenatal depression at 12 weeks ge- station and at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum .
