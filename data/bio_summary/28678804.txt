For example D minutus c is different than P. boiei a and P. distincta b but similar to A. leucopygius c. Comparisons of the mean density-CFUmL-3A and total richness 3B of bacterial morphotype colonies in the anuran species P. boiei P. distincta A. leucopygius and D. minutus from continuous and fragmented forests.

In continuous forests we collected frogs along trails in the Santa Virg'inia section P. boiei and A. leucopygius at Para'iso Eco Lodge P. boiei and P. distincta and at permanent ponds scattered in both localities D. minu- tus.

However differences in the bacterial richness between these forests was observed only for P. boiei G  59.9 P  0.001.Individuals of P. distincta G  0.22 P  0.99 D. minutus G  1.40 P  0.997 and A. leucopy- gius G  1.97 P  0.991 exhibited similar values of bacterial richness across forest types .Differences between sampling sitesVariation in microbiota attributable to sampling site was assessed in D. minutus and P. boiei because only for these two species we had data comparing two sites within each forest type continuous versus fragmented see .

Data on P. distincta were partially published previously by Assis and colleagues .leucopygius 71 for P. boiei 81 for D. minutus and 111 for P. distincta.

Pneumoniae-ATCC 4352.ResultsInterspecific differences in the skin microbiotaThere was no correlation between frog body size snout-vent length and the density of bac- teria CFUmL for three species A. leucopygius Spearman r  -0.005 P  0.978 P. boiei Spearman r  -0.122 P  0.385 P. distincta Spearman r  -0.156 P  0.378.

The highest values of bacterial den- sity and richness were observed on P. boiei whereas D. minutus and A. leucopygius exhibited lower values .

The analysis revealed that only individuals of P. boiei Welch's ANOVA F  5.37 P  0.013 exhibited differ- ences in the bacterial density between individuals from fragments and continuous forest.
