For instance Akkermansia muciniphila is a dominant human gut bacterium that lives in proxim- ity with the epithelium and is able to utilize mucin for growth.Its role in the development of metabolic disor- ders has been studied in detail and beneficial attributes have been associated with this species.Other bacteria of particular interest are butyrate producers as this short- chain fatty acid is an important product of bacterial fermentation in the intestine usually detected in the mM range and influencing many pathophysiological func- tions.The species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is an important butyrate producer in the human gut and has been studied in great detail because of anti-inflammatory properties.Another butyrate producers more recently described is Intestinimonas butyriciproducens.Culture- and genome-based investigations elucidated the role of this bacterium in butyrate production not only fromsugars but also from amino acids a feature that is rare among human gut isolates.Interestingly this species is found in both the human and mouse intestine and differ- ences in the ability to convert dietary sugars were observed depending on the host origin of strains.Other bacteria are known to preferentially colonize certain host species and the origin of bacteria can influence physio- logic functions upon colonization.This highlights the necessity to assess the gut microbiome in a host-spe- cific manner.

In contrast cul- ture-based investigations of the mouse gut microbiota had been rare in the last 2 decades and access to isolates has been a problem.To address these issues the mouse intestinal bacterial collection miBC a publically available repository of bacterial strains from the mouse intestine was recently created .As in the case of cul- ture-based studies of the human gut microbiota this work allowed the description of novel taxa including for instance the first cultured member of family S24-7 now renamed Muribaculaceae within the Bacteroi- dales which is highly prevalent and dominant in the mouse intestine.Of the 100 miBC strains represent- ing 76 species 19 species were characterized by relative abundances higher in mice than human speaking in favor of colonization preferences.

In 2014 approximately 1000 different bacteria isolated from the human intestinal tract were reportedand this figure has been increased by several hundreds of new species obtained thanks to recent effort in cultivating human gut commensals.

Recent reports drew attention to the spread of erroneous values regarding total bacterial cell density in the human gut or species richness detected by sequencing.Total counts determined by growing cells under only one culture condition have a very high risk of underestimating cultured fractions if this condi- tion does not support growth of many species.

Although pioneers such as Elie Metchnik- off had recognized the potentially beneficial role of specific bacteria relatively earlythe diversity of sym- biotic gut bacteria and their implication for health and the development of diseases have received tremendous attention in recent years thanks to breakthroughs in modern sequencing technologies.Previous to this molecular era the study of intestinal bacteria had been boosted in the 1960s and 1970s by the emergence and utilization of anaerobic cultivation techniques which gave access to many bacterial species that were not within reach beforehand.Researchers were atthe time primarily interested in describing bacteria from the human gut and characterizing their diversityc 2017 Taylor  Francisand adaptation to variations in the diet or environ- ment.The gut microbiota of animals was also an important topic of research at the time.

Another very recent work focusing on the study of human gut microbiota by means of cultivation was performed in the laboratory of Trevor Lawley in England.Besides discovering many novel species as in the other studies metagenomic sequence analysis in the latter work led to the conclusion that approximately half of the bacterial genera found in a healthy gut microbiota have the potential to form spores facilitating trans- mission between individuals.

Key species in the human intestine have been identified by means of anaer- obic cultivation.

Moreover initiatives describing novel bacterial diversity from other environments such as the mouse gutor plantscan also help characterizing the human gut microbiota if the same bacterial species or very close relatives happen to colonize our intestine as well.It is difficult to extrapolate the diversity of cultured bacteria as fractions of total diversity they represent.
