for instance akkermansia muciniphila is a dominant human gut bacterium that lives in proxim- ity with the epithelium and is able to utilize mucin for growth.its role in the development of metabolic disor- ders has been studied in detail and beneficial attributes have been associated with this species.other bacteria of particular interest are butyrate producers as this short- chain fatty acid is an important product of bacterial fermentation in the intestine usually detected in the mm range and influencing many pathophysiological func- tions.the species faecalibacterium prausnitzii is an important butyrate producer in the human gut and has been studied in great detail because of anti-inflammatory properties.another butyrate producers more recently described is intestinimonas butyriciproducens.culture- and genome-based investigations elucidated the role of this bacterium in butyrate production not only fromsugars but also from amino acids a feature that is rare among human gut isolates.interestingly this species is found in both the human and mouse intestine and differ- ences in the ability to convert dietary sugars were observed depending on the host origin of strains.other bacteria are known to preferentially colonize certain host species and the origin of bacteria can influence physio- logic functions upon colonization.this highlights the necessity to assess the gut microbiome in a host-spe- cific manner.

in contrast cul- ture-based investigations of the mouse gut microbiota had been rare in the last 2 decades and access to isolates has been a problem.to address these issues the mouse intestinal bacterial collection mibc a publically available repository of bacterial strains from the mouse intestine was recently created .as in the case of cul- ture-based studies of the human gut microbiota this work allowed the description of novel taxa including for instance the first cultured member of family s24-7 now renamed muribaculaceae within the bacteroi- dales which is highly prevalent and dominant in the mouse intestine.of the 100 mibc strains represent- ing 76 species 19 species were characterized by relative abundances higher in mice than human speaking in favor of colonization preferences.

in 2014 approximately 1000 different bacteria isolated from the human intestinal tract were reportedand this figure has been increased by several hundreds of new species obtained thanks to recent effort in cultivating human gut commensals.

although pioneers such as elie metchnik- off had recognized the potentially beneficial role of specific bacteria relatively earlythe diversity of sym- biotic gut bacteria and their implication for health and the development of diseases have received tremendous attention in recent years thanks to breakthroughs in modern sequencing technologies.previous to this molecular era the study of intestinal bacteria had been boosted in the 1960s and 1970s by the emergence and utilization of anaerobic cultivation techniques which gave access to many bacterial species that were not within reach beforehand.researchers were atthe time primarily interested in describing bacteria from the human gut and characterizing their diversityc 2017 taylor  francisand adaptation to variations in the diet or environ- ment.the gut microbiota of animals was also an important topic of research at the time.

this project referred to as the hun- gate1000 project eventually led to the isolation of approximately 600 taxa and the generation of nearly as many genomes now available from public databases.the study of human gut microbiota has been of course a primary interest in recent years too.

the research group of didier raoult in france has been very prolific in isolating bacteria from human feces by using a multitude of different agar media in combina- tion with high-throughput identification of isolates by means of mass spectrometry followed by genomesequencing of interesting isolates.

another very recent work focusing on the study of human gut microbiota by means of cultivation was performed in the laboratory of trevor lawley in england.besides discovering many novel species as in the other studies metagenomic sequence analysis in the latter work led to the conclusion that approximately half of the bacterial genera found in a healthy gut microbiota have the potential to form spores facilitating trans- mission between individuals.

key species in the human intestine have been identified by means of anaer- obic cultivation.

moreover initiatives describing novel bacterial diversity from other environments such as the mouse gutor plantscan also help characterizing the human gut microbiota if the same bacterial species or very close relatives happen to colonize our intestine as well.it is difficult to extrapolate the diversity of cultured bacteria as fractions of total diversity they represent.

recent reports drew attention to the spread of erroneous values regarding total bacterial cell density in the human gut or species richness detected by sequencing.total counts determined by growing cells under only one culture condition have a very high risk of underestimating cultured fractions if this condi- tion does not support growth of many species.

in other words it is in our opinion safer to say that approximately half of bacterial diversity in the human gut can be cultured rather than a minor proportion.

nevertheless it must be acknowledged that the ever increasing numbers of cultured bacteria available originate from cumulative effort in cultivating microbes and that sin- gle studies are per se limited in terms of width and depth of analysis.to complement this literature review and test cor- responding reference values of cultured diversity we present in the next section original data pertaining to estimates obtained by large-scale 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis.table 1. literature-based estimates of the cultured fraction of mammalian gut microbiota.cultured fractionexperimentalinformationsamplesreference2.6microscopic vs. plate counts blood agar in anaerobic jars3.21011 vs. 8.3109 cellg wet weight.14.3dapi vs. plate counts blood agar 2.71011 vs. 3.9 1010 cellg wet weight cultured fraction was 36.5 relative to total microscopic counts 1.11011 cellg20.8dapi vs. plate counts bhi with hemin and yeast extract1.11012 vs. 2.21011 cellg dry weight cultured fraction was 31 relative to total fish counts 7.1 1011 cellg21.5dapi vs. plate counts blood agar 7.61010 vs. 1.61010 cellg cultured fraction was 37.1 relative to total fish counts 4.4 ps 1010 cellg23.5coverage of otus from 16s rrna gene amplicon libraries sequences clustered at 97 expressed as relative abundance of short reads covered at the genus level match in the culture collection 95 sequence identity.32.6microscopic vs. plate counts medium 103.2 vs. 1.1 1011 cellg wet weighthuman feces n d navan houte  gibbons 1966 human feces n d 10langendijk et al.

wefiltered the complete list of samples from human and mouse gut resulting in 16667 and 9369 preprocessed sample profiles respec- tively.

for each sample we extracted the otu table and stored information on the richness of otus their relative abundance and their sequences.to calculate cultured fractions we performed a blast similarity search of every otu sequence in each imngs-derived human and mouse gut sample against our local database of 16s rrna sequences from cultured taxa.
