Within the group of Cxcr2-- mice SMZTMP increased the abundance of Actinobacteria 0.07 in regular diet vs. 0.73 in SMZTMP treatment P  0.01 .Enrichment of bacterial genus by SMZTMP in neonatal Cxcr2-- miceTo more directly investigate which changes in the microbiome are linked to the improved phe- notype induced by SMZTMP we focused on the analysis of the OTU data from Cxcr2-- mice which had a general predominance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria .

Among these Tissierellaceae Actinobacteria and Corynebac- teriaceae were represented at 2 2 levels in a cladogram  with variable population of the genera in individual mice with the exception of Anaerococcus that was not detected in all Cxcr2-- mice of the regular diet group .Only the SMZTMP-treated Cxcr2-- mice showed improvement in the BA-disease pheno- types  but clustering the SMZTMP-treated Cxcr2-- mice using all OTUs  was not successful.

P0.05  P0.01  P0.001  P0.0001.Anaerococcus lactolyticus most clearly differentiates high from low survivability in neonatal Cxcr2-- miceTo more precisely link specific microbiome changes with the biliary atresia phenotype we compared OTU data in the group of Cxcr2-- mice without symptoms after RRV infectionChanges in the intestinal microbiome induced by SMZTMP in Cxcr2-- mice after RRV infection.

Black bar comparison between regular-WT and SMZTMP-WT yellow bar regular-WT and regular- Cxcr2-- green bar regular-WT and SMZTMP- Cxcr2-- gray bar SMZTMP-WT and regular-Cxcr2-- blue bar SMZTMP-WT and SMZTMP-Cxcr2--.

Thus selecting OTUs to distinctly cluster the SMZTMP-treated Cxcr2-- mice from other groups would be a potential analytical strategy to investigate the link between bacterial profiles and the improved phenotype in neonatal mice infected with RRV.Selective bacterial enrichment by SMZTMP in neonatal Cxcr2-- miceThe analysis of the microbiome at the phylum level has been used to characterize various dis- eases in early life .

Among these only Anaerococcus lactolyticus amplicon size 150 bp was detected from the resistant Cxcr2-- mice .Microbiome changes in Cxcr2-- mice with symptoms diseased and without symptoms resistant 14 days after RRV infection.

The frequency of jaundice was lower in neonatal Cxcr2-- mice 14 days after RRV when their mothers received SMZTMP 100 in regular diet vs. 52.4 in SMZTMP P  0.0001  along with improved survival when compared to regular diet 0 in regular diet vs. 55.8 in SMZTMP P  0.0001 .Analysis of EHBDs and livers 14 days after RRV showed two histological patterns in SMZ TMP-Cxcr2-- mice 1 findings similar to WT mice of obstructed EHBD and expanded portal tracts with inflammation when they were fed regular diet or if they received SMZTMP and were symptomatic and 2 intact EHBD epithelial lining with patent lumen and minimally affected portal tract in SMZTMP-Cxcr2-- mice without jaundice .

Notably the inactivation of Cxcr2 alone induced a similar switch with the additional exposure of Cxcr2-- mice to SMZTMP enriching the bacterial signature with Corynebacterium Anaerococcus and Streptococcus in those mice with improved cholestasis and survival.

In keeping with this possibility we found a consis- tent enrichment with Anaerococcus in Cxcr2-- mice resistant to the biliary atresia phenotype when compared to susceptible diseased mice.Although little is known about the mechanisms by which Cxcr2 CXCR2 in humans or its ligands Cxcl-1 2 5 IL-8 in humans modulate the phenotypes of hepatobiliary diseases via changes in the intestinal microbiome the Cxrc2-dependent circuit plays an important role in neutrophil-migration into infected or ulcerated site of an intestinal tract  .

Adult wild-type WT and Cxcr2-- mice were fed a diet supplemented with sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim SMZTMP during pregnancy and lactation and their pups were injected intraperitoneally with rhesus rotavirus RRV within 24 hours of life to induce experimental biliary atresia.
