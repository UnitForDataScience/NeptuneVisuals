The results of the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test IPGTT assay demonstrate that extended intervention with GLP1 significantly attenuates the disruption of glucose metabolism observed in HF-fed mice with reduced blood glucose at 0 min p  0.05 45 min p  0.01 90 min p  0.05 and 120 min p  0.05 Fig.

Curiously both GLP1 p  0.0001 and PNZ intervention p  0.0001 reduced blood glucose levels in the first two time points of the insulin tolerance test ITT Fig.

Significant differences are represented by p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 p  0.0001 where the asterisks are coloured according to the group which they represent.

However both microbial interventions PNZ and GLP1 accumulated significantly less mesenteric adipose tissue MAT p  0.001 and significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue EAT when compared to the HFC p  0.05 Fig.

Prior to the glucose challenge solely GLP1 p  0.05 and LFC p  0.0001 mice displayed a reduced fasting blood glucose concentration when compared to the HFC Fig.

Importantly although PNZ-treated mice displayed a reduced AUC p  0.05 GLP1 cholesterolemia AUC was found to be further reduced when compared to that of PNZ p  0.01.Figure 2.

Interestingly while all high-fat fed groups were statistically similar prior to IP at 15 min GLP1 mice displayed a significantly elevated insulin level when compared to the HFC p  0.01 Fig.

Data was analysed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction significant differences are represented by p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001p  0.0001 where the asterisks are coloured according to the group with which a significant difference was recorded.
