the key pathogenic processes that would be affected by these transformative advances are shown within the ellipseevents that affect the regulation of hematopoiesis cell migration inflammatory activity and lymphocyte differentiation.64-69 sh2b3 inhibits t lymphocyte activation.66the rs3184504a risk allele influences protein phosphorylation by the janus kinase jak family of tyrosine kinases.6670 these effects may in turn affect cytokine production tumour necrosis fac- tor interferon-gamma the transduction of cytokine-mediated signals and the adaptive immune response.6371 the same risk allele has been recognised in other immune-mediated diseases including pri- mary sclerosing cholangitis psc57 coeliac disease72 hypothy- roidism73 rheumatoid arthritis74 and type 1 diabetes mellitus.75 recognition and confirmation of the principal variant allelesassociated with autoimmune hepatitis will allow functional analyses to proceed and possibly indicate pertinent gene products that could be selectively targeted.5876 investigational challengesthe observed risk of autoimmune hepatitis cannot be fully explained by the findings of gwas5877-80 genetic predispositions for autoim- mune hepatitis vary between age groups genders and ethnici- ties5881 and the multiplicity of comparisons in microarray studies can challenge statistical analyses.58 only 53 of northern european patients with autoimmune hepatitis have the rs3184504 allele63 andhla drb10301 or hla drb10401 occurs in only 51 and 55 of white north american patients respectively.82 children with autoimmune hepatitis may have different class ii hla associations than adults83 and patients in different countries or with different ethnicities within the same country may have disparate predisposing genetic factors.818485 these findings suggest that genetic analyses will have a limited impact on explaining the risk of autoimmune hep- atitis and an applicability restricted to subgroups defined by age race and location.

the number of abstracts cited by pubmed from december 1963 to june 2017 and reviewed for pertinence to this review during the pri- mary secondary and tertiary searches was 2830. those judged mostpertinent to the topic exceeded 500 and the number of full-length articles reviewed exceeded 150. results  anticipated advances in epidemiologypopulation-based epidemiological studies have indicated that the incidence of autoimmune hepatitis varies widely between coun- tries19-24 and between adults and children.2526 the annual incidence of autoimmune hepatitis ranges from 0.67 cases per 100 000 per- sons in southern israel22 to 2.0 cases per 100 000 persons in new zealand21 whereas the annual incidence in children is 0.23 cases per 100 000 persons in canada26 and 0.4 cases per 100 000 persons in the united states.25 the incidence of autoimmune hepatitis has also been increasing in some countries.24 in spain the annual incidence of autoimmune hepatitis has increased from 0.83 cases to 1.07 cases per 100 000 persons from 1990 to 20032728 and in denmark the annual incidence has increased from 1.37 cases to 2.33 cases per 100 000 persons between 1994 and 2012 table 1.4 coincident with the different and changing incidences has been disparity in the age of disease onset between countries.

they are products of a continuum of clinical and lab- oratory observations and technological improvements that are defining the antigenic triggers genetic predispositions and homeo- static disruptions that favour loss of self-tolerance.1 they are prod- ucts of population-based epidemiological studies that have suggested associations between the environment and the disease2-4 and they are consequences of animal studies and clinical trials that are changing the paradigm of treatment from one of blanket immunosuppression to one of site-specific molecular and cellular intervention.5recognition of cytochrome p450 2d6 cyp2d6 as the principal autoantigen of one form of autoimmune hepatitis has been a trans- formative advance.67 it has been critical in developing animal models of the human disease8-11 and in understanding mechanisms for breaking the tolerance of self-antigens.1213 clarification of the cell populations that characterise the innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune hepatitis have led to discoveries of home- ostatic imbalances that favour autoimmunity14-17 and these insights into specific pathogenic pathways and perturbed cell populations have constituted another transformative advance that continues to fuel efforts at therapeutic manipulation.518 the future transforma- tive advances can be anticipated as natural progressions of current knowledge and as products of unmet clinical needs and an evolving biotechnology.the goal of this review was to describe the advances that are likely to be transformative in the future understanding and manage- ment of autoimmune hepatitis.
