Although antibiotics and ARGs originating from Chinese swine farms have been documented and characterized  little is known about the relative importance of different abiotic and biotic factors in shaping the swine gut antibiotic resistome.Hence the aim of this study was to perform high-throughput profil- ing of the ARGs in fecal samples from Chinese pig farms and to investi- gate the effect of antibiotic and metals in swine feed on the antibiotic resistome and its association with the microbial community.

All collected seven swine feed and 28 fresh fecal matter samples were sealed in individual 300-mL sterile plastic sampling boxes immediately transported to the laboratory on dry ice and stored at -20 degC for further analysis.Chemical analysis of antibiotics and metals in swine feedA total of 79 different antibiotics were analyzed in swine feed based on a previously published protocol .

Indeed the overuse of antibiotics in Chinese animals may possibly explain why Chinese peo- ple harbor higher numbers of ARGs in their guts than Europeans  .Apart from direct human exposure to ARGs present in swine gut viacontaminated meat  ARGs in swine gut may also spread to humans via pig-house dust  or via ma- nure application and wastewater discharge.

Linear discriminative analysis LDA Effect Size LEfSe  was further used for high- dimensional ARG data and indicator ARGs and microbe discovery .Materials and methodsSamplingA total of 28 fecal samples representing seven groups populations with four replicates of swine receiving seven different feed types were collected in 2014 from three Chinese large-scale swine farms.

For each group four swine feed sam- ples were mixed on site into one pooled swine feed sample while fourbiological replicates of fresh fecal samples were taken immediately after excretion.
