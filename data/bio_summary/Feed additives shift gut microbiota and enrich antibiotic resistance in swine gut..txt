although antibiotics and args originating from chinese swine farms have been documented and characterized  little is known about the relative importance of different abiotic and biotic factors in shaping the swine gut antibiotic resistome.hence the aim of this study was to perform high-throughput profil- ing of the args in fecal samples from chinese pig farms and to investi- gate the effect of antibiotic and metals in swine feed on the antibiotic resistome and its association with the microbial community.

all collected seven swine feed and 28 fresh fecal matter samples were sealed in individual 300-ml sterile plastic sampling boxes immediately transported to the laboratory on dry ice and stored at -20 degc for further analysis.chemical analysis of antibiotics and metals in swine feeda total of 79 different antibiotics were analyzed in swine feed based on a previously published protocol .

indeed the overuse of antibiotics in chinese animals may possibly explain why chinese peo- ple harbor higher numbers of args in their guts than europeans  .apart from direct human exposure to args present in swine gut viacontaminated meat  args in swine gut may also spread to humans via pig-house dust  or via ma- nure application and wastewater discharge.

for each group four swine feed sam- ples were mixed on site into one pooled swine feed sample while fourbiological replicates of fresh fecal samples were taken immediately after excretion.

it should be noted that much higher concentra- tions of metals than observed in this study have been observed in pig fecal matter obtained from other pig farms .a key finding of this study is that the args present in swine gut depended on the composition of the microbial community indicating that swine gut microbiome could be an important conduit for transfer- ring args into the environment.

howev- er the ultimate solution may be to replace antibiotics by other feed ad- ditives such as phytogenic products probiotics and prebiotics  .conclusionsthe presented results clearly indicate that antibiotics and metals used as feed additives in large-scale chinese farming operation shifted the swine gut microbiome and significantly enhanced the diversity and abundance of args in swine gut.

antibiotics and metals are widely used as feed additives and could consequently affect args in swine gut.

in this study high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht-qpcr based arg chip and next- generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data were analyzed using multiple statistical approaches to pro- file the antibiotic resistome and investigate its linkages to antibiotics and metals used as feed additives and to the microbial community composition in freshly collected swine manure samples from three large-scale chinese pig farms.

a total of 146 args and up to 1.3 x 1010 total arg copies per gram of swine feces were detected.
