The development of the gut microbiota is essential for promoting the gut immune system and maintaining system balance 39.

The gene expression profiles of GSE22648 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to screen differentially expressed genes DEGs.

The Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used for Gene Ontology GO functional and pathway enrich- ment analysis of the DEGs.

The upregulated genes were enriched into various GO terms including microsome oxidation reduction and heme binding whereas the 57 downregulated DEGs were enriched in different functions including DNA packaging and linoleic acid metabolism.

The adhesion of intestinal flora to the intestinal wall can have a beneficial or deleterious role in hosts and determines the health status of the gut 2.

Quantile normalization was applied for standardization based on the preprocessCore package of R. The standard matrix was then obtained.The DEGs between two groups were screened using the Limma package 13 bioconductor.orgpackagesrelease biochtmllimma.html version 3.5 and the differences of mean expression values were assessed using the unpaired t-test method.

The online tool of the Database of Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discover DAVID 15 was used for Gene Ontology GO www.geneontology.org and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs.

The cluster heatmap of the DEGs is shown in Fig.

The four upregulated genes were laminin a3 bone morphogenetic protein 1 solute carrier family 22 organic cationzwitterion transporter member 4 SLC22A4 and PDZ domain containing 3.Gene cluster analysis with the literature profiles of all DEGs was processed Fig.
