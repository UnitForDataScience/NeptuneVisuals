hc features in preterms can be also compared with samples from mothers of full term babies to understand the possible differences between these two categories with hc being able to modify its composition based on the necessities of each neonate.moreover in case of hc analysis a strength point of omics is represented by the possibility of a non-invasive sample collection.the abundance of several gf in hc and their crucial role during extrauterine adaptation has also been demonstrated with higher levels in samples from mothers of prematures although in the future several studies should be performed to completely understand their origins exerted effects and the possible correlations with the interesting and fascinating population of scs detected in hc.regarding the pasteurization effects on hc there is still an open debate to evaluate the best technique to least modify its natural and beneficial components to ensure adequate quantities of donated hc those babies whose mothers are unable to provide.improved knowledge of different features between hc and mm with a further comparison to fm confirmed the arguments sustaining breastfeeding promotion and colostrum administration especially in nicu and could also result in formulating the most suitable milk and dairy food composition to provide for each category of newborn.conflicts of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.referencesyang m. cao x. wu r. liu b. ye w. yue x. wu j. comparative proteomic exploration of whey proteins in human and bovine colostrum and mature milk using itraq-coupled lc-msms.

furthermore human colostrum hc seems to have a peculiar role in newborn support and plays a protective role against allergic and chronic diseases in addition to long-term benefits such as a reduction in systo-diastolic pressure and total cholesterol decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus dm2 overweight and obesity -.nutrients 2017 9 843 doiin fact it seems that hc could contain different products on the basis of the newborn's characteristics for example the hc of preterm neonates shows specific factors to sustain correct growth and maturation and to prevent specific complications .in this review we analyzed and discussed the very recent published literature in the english language found in medline using omics transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics microbiomics pasteurization and growth factors hc and preterm newborns as key words.our aim was to provide new evidence in terms of omics technologies in hc.

in addition 17 exosomes proteins upregulated in hc were involved in transport mechanisms potentially playing important roles in signal transmission additionally the solute carrier family 2 and atp synthase subunit delta was overexpressed.in conclusion a great variability has been detected in both human and bovine samples with a higher number of differentially expressed immune-related proteins in hc .cytokines and chemokinesthe presence of several cytokines in hm showing a higher concentration in hc has already been reported in many studies.

little is known about the effects of gdm on hc composition .several studies have shown a correlation between maternal insulin sensitivity and immunological hc status demonstrated a lower level of iga igg and c3 proteins in hc of hyperglycemic mothers  and lower levels of iga and its glycosylate form in the transitional milk tm of gdm mothers .it has also been demonstrated that gdm greatly influences hm glycome  and grapov et al.

evaluated modifications of hormonal and immunological components comparing hc samples from normoweight n  15 overweight n  15 and obese mothers n  15 demonstrating an increase of adiponectin and leptin in obese mothers globally these results suggest that hc can minimize inflammation and protect against negative fetal programming which could lead to obesity later in life .however there are still dissenting opinions about the high levels of adiponectin concentration in hm for example some authors had previously associated it to lower weight gain at 6 months of life or to childhood obesity .in the literature review we did not find correlations between proteome transcription factors and metabolites in hc from mothers delivering macrosomic fetuses compared with mothers affected by gdm but it could result in interesting and relevant research in the search for such analogies in these populations.macrosomic newbornsin macrosomic newborns short-term risk of metabolic problems electrolyte disorders glycopenia and hyperbilirubinemia have been described in references .

3t-fl increased during the first 28 days in both term and preterm groups while lacto-n-fucopentaose iii and lacto-n-neotetraose were lower in preterm instead of term hc but were similar at 28 lactation days.differences between mature hm samples in the intervals before and after 26 weeks have not been described suggesting that after the variability detected in hc the metabolome tended to re-align after several weeks of milk maturation .the importance of hmos was also related to their possible influence on gut microbiota reducing the incidence of nec .amino acids and creatininein the analyzed studies amino acids showed high variability across all lactation phases especially in hc .in particular some of these decreased during lactation  glutamate increased  while valine and leucine increased more in preterm samples than in full term hm .

another important protein the s100b involved in metabolic and neuronal growth has also been detected in hc .these recent studies confirm that hc supports and promotes the regular development of both the systemic nervous system snc and ens.angiogenic growth factorsvascular endothelial growth factors vegf such as platelet-derived growth factor pdgf-bb involved in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis mechanisms have been found in hc with decreasing concentrations during lactation .

in a recent review regarding hm and pasteurization among 44 analyzed articles there were only six regarding hc .the most relevant data confirmed that in hc as it happens in mature hm the saccharide component was not modified after pasteurization while the immunological immunoprotective and immunomodulating protein fractions underwent variations.hp modifies the hc immunological profile reducing iga igg and igm moreover an impairment of immunoprotective activity related to a reduction in lisozime and lactoferrin levels has also been described -.

since hc results are so precious particularly for the vulnerable pre-terms category we also discuss the importance of hm pasteurization to ensure donated hc even to neonates whose mothers are unable to provide.

this differential protein expression underlines the variability of hc immunological features .many differently expressed whey proteins in hc are also involved in enzyme regulatory activity modulating several biological functions for example high levels of thyroxine-binding globulin have been detected .

plastin-2 is involved in phosphorylation and leukocyte function acting as a potential biological marker and showing antibacterial activity -.the highest expression variability has been detected in proteins associated with ribosomes regulation of actin cytoskeleton potentially modifying signal transduction and actin related cellular functions  glycolysis gluconeogenesis leukocyte transendothelial migration aminoacyltrna biosynthesis pentose phosphate pathway galactose metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis.moreover high levels of ig kappa chain v-iii region cll and anti-thyroglobulin heavy chain variable region have been detected in hc .many differentially expressed proteins are involved in the modulation of newborn immune response and protection against oxidative stress among these 15 were highly expressed in hc such as neutrophil defensin 1 immunoglobulin j chain cdna flj14473 fis igh protein and superoxide dismutase .

in contrast these mediators increased in hc from gdm mothers and this observation seems to support the hypothesis that gdm could determine a delayed lactogenesis previously demonstrated for obese women  moreover gdm could also interfere with the occurrence of copious lactation .lower levels of alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein apolipoprotein a1 and e 14-3-3 protein zetadelta protein disulfide-isomerase protein dj-1 and protein fam3b pancreatic derived factor have also been detected in the hc of gdm mothers.

the reduced expression of this group of proteins if confirmed by further studies seems to point out a long-term protective role of gdm mother's hc on newborns.several studies have investigated the biochemical and immunological changes of hc related to maternal overweight and obesity.

detected changes in carnitine caprylate caprate pantothenate urea lactose oligosaccharides citrate phosphocoline choline and formate during milk maturation underlying that preterm hm metabolome varied during 5-7 weeks postpartum probably reaching the composition of term milk after this time and independently from premature ga. in the same study higher levels of valine leucine betaine creatinine pantothenate citric and lactic acid in hc and tm weredemonstrated .in preterm hc there was an increased level of oligosaccharides hmos citrate and creatinine.

demonstrated a different composition of term hc samples during the first lactation week compared with samples of the fourth lactation week with higher levels of lysolipids phospholipids alpha-tocoferol cholesterol fucose furanose d-glucosaminic acid and lower levels of oleic linoleic palmitoleic gluconic and idrossiadipic acids di- and tri-glycerids and lisophosphatidyletanolamine in hc .our research group in collaboration with turin university conducted a comparative study between two subcategories of premature milk underlining the differences existing in their metabolome.
