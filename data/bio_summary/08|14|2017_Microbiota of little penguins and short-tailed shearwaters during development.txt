The results indicated that microbial development dif- fered between the two seabird species with the short-tailed shearwater microbiota being rel- atively stable throughout development whilst significant fluctuations in the microbial composition and an upward trend in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were observed in the little penguin.

In the little penguin there were sig- nificant differences throughout development and significant upward trends in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes whereas in the short-tailed shearwater there were no signifi- cant differences in the microbial composition throughout development and appeared to be rel- atively stable throughout development with a high level of similarity between each age class.The microbial composition of the little penguin is dominated by microbes that are responsi- ble for the absorption of dietary fats lipids and soluble vitamins they maintain intestinal bar- rier function regulate triglycerides impact intestinal permeability activate intestine-brain- liver neural axis enhance the immune system alter lipoprotein profiles protect against stress- induced lesions modulate proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression butyrate production  and strengthen epithelial cell barrier properties.

The species by time interaction was significant P  0.033 with an additional linear increase of 0.0729 -0.0338 per week in the LP species.

The differences between little penguins and short-tailed shearwaters could be in part due to differences in diet composition digestive physiology nesting environment host phylogeny and reproductive strategy all of which have been previously shown to strongly influence the microbial composition of vertebrates  -.In seabirds fledging body mass is associated with juvenile survival - and therefore the accumulation of fat reserves is important for post fledging survival.

This process creates an environment that is highly favourable for facultative and obligate anaerobes   such as Bacteroides Clostridia and Bifidobacterium   to flourish before stabilising as an anaerobic environment that is representative of the adult GI tract.This study examined the GI microbiome of the short-tailed shearwater STS Ardenna tenuirostris and the little penguin LP Eudyptula minor.

Cloacal swabs were collected from little penguin n  9 and short-tailed shear- water chicks n  10 during development at the Phillip Island Nature Parks 38.4833S 145.2333E.

None of the identified processes differed significantly between species and none correlated significantly with chick age.DiscussionEstablishment and early colonisation of the GI tract has been recognised as a crucial stage in chick development with pioneering microbial species responsible for influencing the GI tract pH oxygen levels mucosal structure and immunity and therefore these pioneering species Alpha diversity measures based on a rarefaction depth of 2104.Statistical comparison was the non-parametric t-test implemented by QIIME v 1.8 with 1000 bootstrap replicates.

Accordingly this study aimed to examine the establishment and microbial succession that occurs in little penguin and short-tailed shearwater chicks through- out development.Bar charts showing the taxonomic diversity of LP and STS samples proportion of total reads assigned to each taxon.

However due to the absence of data available on the role of microbes in seabirds the importance of the microbiota for the survival of little penguins and short-tailed shearwaters requires more study.Species differencesEstablishment and early colonisation of the GI tract has been recognised as a crucial stage in infant development with pioneering species responsible for influencing the GI tract pH oxy- gen levels mucosal structure and immunity -.
