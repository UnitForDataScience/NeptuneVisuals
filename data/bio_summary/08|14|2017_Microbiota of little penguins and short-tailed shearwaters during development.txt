in the little penguin there were sig- nificant differences throughout development and significant upward trends in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes whereas in the short-tailed shearwater there were no signifi- cant differences in the microbial composition throughout development and appeared to be rel- atively stable throughout development with a high level of similarity between each age class.the microbial composition of the little penguin is dominated by microbes that are responsi- ble for the absorption of dietary fats lipids and soluble vitamins they maintain intestinal bar- rier function regulate triglycerides impact intestinal permeability activate intestine-brain- liver neural axis enhance the immune system alter lipoprotein profiles protect against stress- induced lesions modulate proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression butyrate production  and strengthen epithelial cell barrier properties.

the results indicated that microbial development dif- fered between the two seabird species with the short-tailed shearwater microbiota being rel- atively stable throughout development whilst significant fluctuations in the microbial composition and an upward trend in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes were observed in the little penguin.

none of the identified processes differed significantly between species and none correlated significantly with chick age.discussionestablishment and early colonisation of the gi tract has been recognised as a crucial stage in chick development with pioneering microbial species responsible for influencing the gi tract ph oxygen levels mucosal structure and immunity and therefore these pioneering species alpha diversity measures based on a rarefaction depth of 2104.statistical comparison was the non-parametric t-test implemented by qiime v 1.8 with 1000 bootstrap replicates.

little penguin samples were collected within the summerland peninsula a pre- vious housing estate which had been reclaimed for penguin habitat.

this process creates an environment that is highly favourable for facultative and obligate anaerobes   such as bacteroides clostridia and bifidobacterium   to flourish before stabilising as an anaerobic environment that is representative of the adult gi tract.this study examined the gi microbiome of the short-tailed shearwater sts ardenna tenuirostris and the little penguin lp eudyptula minor.

cloacal swabs were collected from little penguin n  9 and short-tailed shear- water chicks n  10 during development at the phillip island nature parks 38.4833s 145.2333e.

short-tailed shearwater samples were collected from shearwaters nesting in natural burrows among the sand dunes of the phillip island nature parks penguin parade.

accordingly this study aimed to examine the establishment and microbial succession that occurs in little penguin and short-tailed shearwater chicks through- out development.bar charts showing the taxonomic diversity of lp and sts samples proportion of total reads assigned to each taxon.

following hatching the body mass of short-tailed shearwater chicks rapidly increased and by week 7 the body mass of chicks exceeded that of the adult shearwater by 15-50 .while many factors such as a high lipid diet and gut physiology may influence body mass the high abundance of firmicutes of the short-tailed shearwater chick may confer a predisposition towards developing body fat stores.
