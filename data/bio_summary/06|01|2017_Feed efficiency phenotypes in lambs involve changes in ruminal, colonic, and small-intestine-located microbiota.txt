In this context the pregastric rumen has logically received much attention due to its immense size and importance representing 80 of total GIT mass and serving as the location where  85 of the total SCFAs are produced in a ruminants GIT Oh et al.

Greater relative abundances of Proteobacteria OTUs 30 33 and 37 in the small intes- tine and distal GIT may reflect dysbioses of these GIT regions among less efficient animals.

Yeoman23Department of Animal and Range Science Montana State University Bozeman 59717ABSTRACT Several studies have revealed differenc- es in rumen-located microbes between greatly efficient and inefficient animals however how the microbiota vary in the hind gastrointestinal tract GIT has only been sparsely explored and how they vary in the small intes- tine remains to be determined.
