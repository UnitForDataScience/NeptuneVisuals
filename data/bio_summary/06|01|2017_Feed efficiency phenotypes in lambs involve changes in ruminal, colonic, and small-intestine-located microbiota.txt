the 16s rrna gene v3-v4 region profiles of all samples were analyzed and revealed unique micro- biota in all git locations except the jejunum and ileum anosim r  0.2 p  0.001. measures of b-diversity revealed greater dissimilarity between more anatomi- cally distant git locations e.g.

short-chain fatty acids produced by their git microbes for 70 of their daily energy re- quirements and the microbes themselves for more than 50 of their daily protein requirements yeoman and white 2014. it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the git microbiota of ruminant livestock make sig- nificant contributions to feed efficiency phenotypes.

in this context the pregastric rumen has logically received much attention due to its immense size and importance representing 80 of total git mass and serving as the location where  85 of the total scfas are produced in a ruminants git oh et al.

greater relative abundances of proteobacteria otus 30 33 and 37 in the small intes- tine and distal git may reflect dysbioses of these git regions among less efficient animals.

our findings show biospatial delineations of microbi- ota throughout the git and suggest that feed efficiency extends beyond the rumen transcending these regions and involves increases in both rumen- and colon-locat- ed fibrolytic taxa increases in bifidobacterial species in the small intestine and reductions in small intestine and distal git-located proteobacteria.key words feed efficiency gastrointestinal tract gut biospatiality lamb microbiota residual feed intakec 2017 american society of animal science.
