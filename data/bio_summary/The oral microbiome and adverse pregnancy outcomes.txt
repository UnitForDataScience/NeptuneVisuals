results of intervention studies in which periodontal disease was treated in the second trimester of pregnancy have generated conflicting results.30119-127 reasons for this lack of effect may involve several design and methodology issues such as 1 variations in the comprehensive nature of the periodontal examination that is partial vs full-mouth examination which result in an imprecise determination of disease severity 2 variations in the consistency in timing of the periodontal examination with respect to gestational age 3 lack of masking of examiners 4 lack of multivari- able analyses that considered confounders30 5 variations in treatment protocols 6 treatment failed to adequately reduce periodontal inflammation and 7 treatment rendered in the second trimester may be too late to elicit a beneficial effect on pregnancy outcomes.

this latter pathway does not seem to have been addressed in the research literature.regardless of the origin infections leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes that involve bacteria common to the oral cavity raise at least two relevant questions from a public health viewpointwill preconception treatment of periodontal disease that is reduction of inflammation bacterial loads and inflammatory mediators in a reproductive age female reduce the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomesgiven the possibility of transmission of oral pathogenic microbes during sexual activities will preconception treatment of periodontal disease in both partners reduce the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomesgiven the cost of dental care in the us and some other developed countries the maldistribution of dental practitio- ners in urban vs rural localities and the lack of dental care in many underdeveloped countries a profound disparity exists in access to dental care and in periodontal health in poor andor rural populations.142-150 assuming that research initiatives will eventually answer the two questions listedabove the medical and dental public health communities still need to develop strategies to address access to care.conclusionsignificant evidence supports an association between the dis- semination of pathogenic bacteria associated with moderate and severe periodontitis and extraoral infections and inflamma- tion.

the authors did not address severity of disease in the traditional manner but rather assessed the need for treatment using the community periodontal index of treatment needs cpitn.89 a cpitn score of 1 bop score of 2 presence of supra- or subgingival calculus score of 3 periodontal probing depth of 3.5-5.5 mm score of 4 probing depth 5.5 mm.

in general both studies reported that females regardless of age group had a greater prevalence of periodontal disease than did males roughly 55 vs 44.a study by murthy et al90 assessed the association of periodontal disease to preterm birth and low birth weight.

alocis c. rectus and others render them as potential collaborators in adverse outcomes of pregnancy.21151-154 the biologic plausibility of the association between periodontal disease the inherent bacteria and systemic impact of inflam- matory mediators and adverse pregnancy outcomes likely involves several pathways 1 a hematogenous spread bacte- remia of periodontal pathogens151 2 a hematogenous spread of multiple mediators of inflammation that are generated by the host andor fetal immune response to pathogenic bacteria116155 and 3 a possible oral microbial pathogen transmission with subsequent colonization in the vaginal microbiome resulting from sexual practices.
