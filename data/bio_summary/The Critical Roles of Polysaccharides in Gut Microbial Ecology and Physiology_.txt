The interactions between gut microbes and host glycans are already known to be manifold and can contribute to beneficial or detrimental outcomes for both the host and gut microbes.

Even more interesting B. thetaiotaomicron mutants that cannot utilize L-fucose as a nutrient source fail to elicit ileal fucosylation in germfree mice suggesting the presence of atwo-way signaling pathway by which microbial foraging of fucose from host glycans triggers in- creased production by the host 17 56.

A shift from utilizing dietary versus host polysaccharide nutrients has been observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with just one bacterium B. thetaiotaomicron 121 which is otherwise metabolically programmed to preferentially degrade dietary fiber polysaccha- rides before mucin glycans 72 94 103 and may otherwise avoid foraging on host carbohydrates in the presence of sufficient dietary input.

All three of the above sources of glycobiological diversity plant animal and microbial converge in the human distal gut where a dense and dynamic community of symbiotic microbes mi- crobiota exists in homeostasis from a microbial perspective perhaps turbulent disequilibrium with the host.

While gut bacteria arguably produce most MPGs for their own immediate benefit such as surviving attacks from the host immune system phages or environmental challenges it is perhaps not surprising that the large number of glycobiological configurations that have been explored by gut bacteria have produced other biological effects.MPGs could be harnessed to benefit human health in several ways.

Symbiotic human gut bacteria with variable metabolic priorities for host mucosal glycans.

Gnotobiotic mouse model of phage- bacterial host dynamics in the human gut.

We focus on the sources and chemical details of the complex carbohydrates that mediate these interactions as well as emerging frontiers in understanding and manipulating these complex relationships to promote health.INFLUENCE OF DIETARY POLYSACCHARIDES ON THE MICROBIOTA-HOST SYMBIOSISThe genomic era coupled to reinvigorated culturing efforts for human gut microorganisms has accelerated mechanistic research toward understanding a mutualistic behavior that has long been attributed to human gut microbes the critical importance of these organisms in digesting dietary fiber polysaccharides 47.
