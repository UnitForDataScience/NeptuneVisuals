the structures of these glycans typically conjugated to either lipids or proteins o-linked to serine or threonine or n-linked to asparagine are distinct from those of dietary polysaccharides other than milk oligosaccharides which are them- selves produced by host mammals and can overlap substantially with o-linked glycans figure 1. the interactions between gut microbes and host glycans are already known to be manifold and can contribute to beneficial or detrimental outcomes for both the host and gut microbes.

even more interesting b. thetaiotaomicron mutants that cannot utilize l-fucose as a nutrient source fail to elicit ileal fucosylation in germfree mice suggesting the presence of atwo-way signaling pathway by which microbial foraging of fucose from host glycans triggers in- creased production by the host 17 56. this phenomenon of commensal-mediated cell surface fucosylation was subsequently recapitulated in cultured murine ileal organoids injected only withb.

while the examples discussed above outline paths by which gut microbes trigger host glycosyla- tion or elicit disease in the absence of normal mucin glycan development additional recent studies have revealed that the microbiota can be driven to erode the colonic mucous layer in the absence of dietary polysaccharides 35 39. because the dietary polysaccharides that collectively compose fiber from plants and other sources figure 1 are a predominant source of nutrition for the microbiota the absence of these nutrients forces some members of the microbiota to rely instead on indigenous host glycans.

a shift from utilizing dietary versus host polysaccharide nutrients has been observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with just one bacterium b. thetaiotaomicron 121 which is otherwise metabolically programmed to preferentially degrade dietary fiber polysaccha- rides before mucin glycans 72 94 103 and may otherwise avoid foraging on host carbohydrates in the presence of sufficient dietary input.

individual additions of several different l. reuteri eps including the starch-like polysaccharide reuteran figure 1 reduces hemagglutination of enterotoxigenic e. coli etec with red blood cells a proxy assay for binding to mucus and other glycan-based host receptors 132. moreover treatment of pig small intestine with reuteran in an ex vivo model reduces attachment of etec to host cells 23. interestingly not all eps influence pathogen toxicity by reducing pathogen abundance and may therefore work via other mechanisms.

b14 linkage between two sugars is written as b4.

emerging data indicate that polysaccharides play extensive roles in host-gut microbiota symbiosis beyond dietary polysaccharide digestion including microbial interactions with endogenous host glycans and the importance of microbial polysac- charides.

as host and microbial metabolic pathways are intimately connected with diet we highlight the potential to manipulate this system for health.349introductionpolysaccharides are the most chemically diverse molecules in living systems 14. this is due partly to the fact that they are composed of more than 20 common substituent sugars when one counts different monosaccharides plus their variable pyranose six-atom and furanose five-atom ring forms figure 1. however unlike nucleic acids and proteins which are linked by uniform phosphodiester and peptide bonds polysaccharides can be extensively diversified by their linkage patterns which may be either a or b and can be branched at more than two positions on a single substituent.

agarose and carrageenan that are essential for the physiology and structural integrity of these organisms 2 19 52 91. it is likely that even more diversity exists in the o- and n-linked-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------figure 1representative diversity of polysaccharides derived from various dietary host and microbial sources.

the three major sources of polysaccharides diet endogenous host glycans and microbially produced glycans indigenous to the microbiota are arranged in order of increasing diversity beginning in the upper left and proceeding clockwise through indigenous microbiota polysaccharides.

for the latter only two escherichia coli capsule cps structures are shown which overlap with the host glycosaminoglycans heparin and chondroitin sulfate.

all three of the above sources of glycobiological diversity plant animal and microbial converge in the human distal gut where a dense and dynamic community of symbiotic microbes mi- crobiota exists in homeostasis from a microbial perspective perhaps turbulent disequilibrium with the host.

however other host and microbial carbohydrate-based physiological pathways have also emerged as important factors in health and disease and some of these are influenced by diet.
