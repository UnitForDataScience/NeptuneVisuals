Additional research in mice has shown that exposure prior to birth has a stronger effect on an obese phenotype than expo- sure after weaning.25 Because macaques mature faster than hu- mans timing of administration could have been a factor in the findings for our current study if the susceptible window for effect on growth rate for macaques differs appreciably from the 6-mo time point chosen.Human studies have shown that antibiotics administration at an early age has a greater growth promotion effect on male infants than female.3037 Similar sex-associated differences have been found in mice.5 Because most male macaques are removed prior to the onset of puberty sex asymmetry in breeding groups of rhesus macaques becomes standard by 5 y of age.

However when germ-free animals are inoculated with microorganisms from the distal bowel of their conventionally reared cohorts there is a rapid increase 57 in total body fat content without concurrent increase in caloric consumption.4 The composition of the human microbiome flora is established during the early developmental period and can be affected by many factors including gestational age at birth type of delivery vaginal delivery compared with Cesarean section feeding method nursed compared with bottle- fed infants and antibiotic administration during the early stages of life.17 The processes and mechanisms by which altering the microbiome affects growth are not completely understood but antibiotics have conclusively been shown to dramatically alter the gastrointestinal microbiome of both humans and mice.1017213145 The composition of the intestinal flora directly affects energy bal- ance in mice energy harvest from dietary sources storage of en- ergy in the form of triglycerides and fatty acid oxidation leading to energy expenditure have all been demonstrated experimen- tally to modify energy balance in mice.43142 Alterations of this equation can mediate downstream metabolic effects including diet-induced obesity insulin resistance and diabetes.18212331 Prior research regarding the microbiome of NHP has focused primar- ily on its characterization its social and immunologic factors and the influence of neonatal dietary choices26324046 but the current study is the first to study the effect of antibiotic use on the growth of NHP.The aim of our study was to determine the effect of antibiotic administration on the growth curves of rhesus macaques Ma- caca mulatta through early adulthood.

In addition the removal of postpubertal male macaques is desirable to maintain genetic heterogeneity and prevent inbreeding.14 The outdoor corrals at our center contain as many as 100 to 150 adult females but typi- cally only 3 to 10 adult male macaques.Some human studies have shown that male infants who re- ceived antibiotics at an early age experience a greater growth- promoting effect than female babies.133037 Similar sex-associated differences arose in some mouse studies although others did not find this same sex-associated bias or did not control for sex.710 Similarly some human studies showed growth increases in both males and females given antibiotics537 some human studies2839 did not control for infant sex but showed the same antibiotic- related effect.

Statistically providing each treated animal with a matched con- trol reduces the effect of these potential variables and provides a significant advantage over human studies where control of these types of variables is not reasonable.We evaluated growth curves through age 5 y when rhesus ma- caques typically have achieved sexual maturity.14 Limiting inclu- sion to those animals that survived through age 5 y eliminates potential bias from infant mortality because animals that die or are euthanized at a young age are more likely to have atypical growth rates prior to death.

Still recent research has shown that long-term low-dose penicillin administration results in a host of metabolic and fatty changes in mice25 and a longitudinal human study in the Netherlands found an association with both increased height and weight at age 10 to broad-spectrum b-lactam exposure a class that in at least one study produced no appreciable change15 particularly multiple courses prior to age 2.26The most commonly used antibiotic in our infant NHP enro- floxacin often administered for bacterial enteritis is not used in human infants and the analog ciprofloxacin is not a routine first- line therapeutic option.44 This situation could be a possible factor in the differences between our study's findings and those of the human and mouse studies.

Determining the basis for this difference might improve our understanding of the risks of early- life antibiotic treatment and suggest mitigation strategies for treating infant illnesses without risking obesity.Research since the 1940s has shown that administering sub- stances with antibiotic properties during the first few months of life to pigs chickens and cattle can affect the growth pattern in these food animals.112022 This association was noted even before it was clearly understood that the compounds being administered had antibiotic properties many were given to increase access to vitamins in diets.12 In addition early-life antibiotic exposure has been shown to significantly influence body composition and growth rate of mice.10 Recent clinical research has supported the hypothesis that exposure to particularly broad-spectrum anti- biotics13745 or macrolide antibiotics37 in humans younger than 12 mo of age increases the likelihood of obesity3039 particularly with repeat exposures.5 This effect may begin prior to birth in humans one study found an 84 higher risk of obesity at age 7 when mothers had taken antibiotics in the second or third trimes- ters of pregnancy.41In the early 20th century evidence of potential harm from over- use and misuse of antibiotics began to accumulate.919 At the same time evidence for unexpected positive effects emerged such as the prevention of the onset of diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice given vancomycin29 and the use of specific types of antibiotics as effective treatments for noninfectious disorders such as he- patic encephalopathy and irritable bowel syndrome.1343 Since theReceived 07 Sep 2016.

The hypothesis was that early antibiotic administration that is before 6 mo of age would cause increased growth in NHP by age 5 y similar to the increased growth in humans and mice that results in obesity.Materials and MethodsAnimal selection and study design.

We used a retrospective case-control matched-cohort study de- sign to compare the growth rates of rhesus macaques from birth through age 5 y for animals that received antibiotics prior to 6 mo of age with those who did not.
