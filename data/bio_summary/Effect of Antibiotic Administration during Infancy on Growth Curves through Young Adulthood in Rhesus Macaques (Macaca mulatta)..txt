however when germ-free animals are inoculated with microorganisms from the distal bowel of their conventionally reared cohorts there is a rapid increase 57 in total body fat content without concurrent increase in caloric consumption.4 the composition of the human microbiome flora is established during the early developmental period and can be affected by many factors including gestational age at birth type of delivery vaginal delivery compared with cesarean section feeding method nursed compared with bottle- fed infants and antibiotic administration during the early stages of life.17 the processes and mechanisms by which altering the microbiome affects growth are not completely understood but antibiotics have conclusively been shown to dramatically alter the gastrointestinal microbiome of both humans and mice.1017213145 the composition of the intestinal flora directly affects energy bal- ance in mice energy harvest from dietary sources storage of en- ergy in the form of triglycerides and fatty acid oxidation leading to energy expenditure have all been demonstrated experimen- tally to modify energy balance in mice.43142 alterations of this equation can mediate downstream metabolic effects including diet-induced obesity insulin resistance and diabetes.18212331 prior research regarding the microbiome of nhp has focused primar- ily on its characterization its social and immunologic factors and the influence of neonatal dietary choices26324046 but the current study is the first to study the effect of antibiotic use on the growth of nhp.the aim of our study was to determine the effect of antibiotic administration on the growth curves of rhesus macaques ma- caca mulatta through early adulthood.

additional research in mice has shown that exposure prior to birth has a stronger effect on an obese phenotype than expo- sure after weaning.25 because macaques mature faster than hu- mans timing of administration could have been a factor in the findings for our current study if the susceptible window for effect on growth rate for macaques differs appreciably from the 6-mo time point chosen.human studies have shown that antibiotics administration at an early age has a greater growth promotion effect on male infants than female.3037 similar sex-associated differences have been found in mice.5 because most male macaques are removed prior to the onset of puberty sex asymmetry in breeding groups of rhesus macaques becomes standard by 5 y of age.

the time spent inside roughly doubled for animals treated with antibiotics compared with those untreated males treated 30.6 d untreated 15.8 d females treated 34.0 d untreated 12.6 d but all animals still spent relatively few days indoors during their first 5 y.no animals included in this study suffered from chronic diar- rhea a common ailment of rhesus macaques during the studyperiod because the definition used in our facility would automat- ically disqualify animals from this project due to time spent in- side on treatment.

the animals included spanned a 30-y time frame the earliest birth date included was 1984 and the most recent animal reached 5 y of age in 2014. in- formation evaluated included animal age sex weights between birth and age 5 y and whether animals were treated with antibiot- ics prior to 6 mo of age.the subjects of the study were 99 matched pairs 87 pairs of female macaques and 12 pairs of males of indian-origin rhesus macaques .this sex ratio is representative of the outdoor housed population and all animals meeting the criteria for the study were included.

statistically providing each treated animal with a matched con- trol reduces the effect of these potential variables and provides a significant advantage over human studies where control of these types of variables is not reasonable.we evaluated growth curves through age 5 y when rhesus ma- caques typically have achieved sexual maturity.14 limiting inclu- sion to those animals that survived through age 5 y eliminates potential bias from infant mortality because animals that die or are euthanized at a young age are more likely to have atypical growth rates prior to death.

in addition the removal of postpubertal male macaques is desirable to maintain genetic heterogeneity and prevent inbreeding.14 the outdoor corrals at our center contain as many as 100 to 150 adult females but typi- cally only 3 to 10 adult male macaques.some human studies have shown that male infants who re- ceived antibiotics at an early age experience a greater growth- promoting effect than female babies.133037 similar sex-associated differences arose in some mouse studies although others did not find this same sex-associated bias or did not control for sex.710 similarly some human studies showed growth increases in both males and females given antibiotics537 some human studies2839 did not control for infant sex but showed the same antibiotic- related effect.

although we do not have specific genetic information on animals within our study the capabil- ity to monitor this parameter is too recent to have been possible for our project this familial interrelatedness reduces variability due to factors other than the one being studied early antibiotic administration.by selecting macaques housed in an outdoor setting we elimi- nated animals involved in invasive research projects that might alter growth rates during the timeframe of the study.

restricting inclusion to only those animals housed outside for most 4.5 y of their first 5 y reduces bias and weight growth skew due to significant ill- ness because young animals with significant illnesses typically remain indoors for care.

macaques were weighed at least once yearly animals that were brought to the hospital for treatment were weighed as a part of their veterinary evaluation and thus may have had more weight assessments per year.time spent in indoor caging reflects approximate days of ill- ness because outdoor-housed animals are brought inside tempo- rarily to resolve illness or injury.

comparing a younger subset of animals to account for ma- turity differences between human and rhesus infants in a group of animals that could be weighed more frequently would provide additional information.

we used a retrospective case-control matched-cohort study de- sign to compare the growth rates of rhesus macaques from birth through age 5 y for animals that received antibiotics prior to 6 mo of age with those who did not.

statistics were evaluated and graphs created by using statistica 12 dell software round rock tx.resultsgrowth rate did not differ p  0.45 between rhesus ma- caques treated with antibiotics in infancy and untreated controls figures 1 and 2. the average growth rate slope for control female macaques was 1.25 - 0.22 kg annually compared withtable 1. antibiotics administeredsulfamethoxazolethe total number of antibiotic exposures is greater than 99 because some animals received multiple antibiotics or multiple courses.1.21 - 0.17 kg yearly for antibiotic-treated females.

the number of antibiotic events is greater than the number of macaques on study because some animals received multiple an- tibiotics at one time or had multiple courses during their first 6 mo table 1.animals included on our study had much greater variable con- trol compared with human studies on this subject.

many showed the growth promotion effect to be correlated with male sex infants given multiple courses and those who received macrolide antibiotics with lesser effects noted in females those administered single courses and those given antibiotics other than macrolides.53739 although many stud- ies found the effects to be persistent one study found that the changes resolved over time between 38 mo and 7 y of age.39 onestudy found that antibiotic administration occurred both earlier and at a higher rate in boys than girls and these differences may help explain the outcomes that find a higher incidence of effects in boys.37we evaluated weight as a function of the growth of our rhesus macaques as is standard practice in mouse studies addressing this topic.

if temporary growth differences that is those lasting less than 1 y in the control and antibiotic-treated populations are eroded by 'catch-up' growth the infrequent weight measure- ments may not have captured those differences.the nature of juvenile diseases experienced by the nhp pop- ulation compared with the human population might have in- fluenced the study outcome.
