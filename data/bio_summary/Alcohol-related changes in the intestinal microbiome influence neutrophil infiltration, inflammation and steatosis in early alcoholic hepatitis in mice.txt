other fam- ilies with reduced abundance in alcohol-fed mice included lachnospiraceae and a-diversity of cecal bacterial content.single rarefaction at a depth of 10000 sequences indicated no significant difference in a-diversity between pair- and ethanol-fed cecal bacterial communities by four different metrics.alcohol induces shifts in various bacterial phyla.

significant reduction in the number of colony forming units cfus in antibiotic-treated mice  confirmed intesti- nal bacterial decontamination.neutrophil infiltration to the liver is attenuated in mice with reduced gut bacterial loadhaving established a reduction in bacterial load and circulating lps we hypothesized that this might reduce hepatic inflammation.

indeed akkermansia has been found to be decreased in mouse models of obesity and type-2 diabetes while supplementation with the bacteria alleviated the burden of metabolic dysfunction .beyond the effects of alcohol on cecal bacterial community changes we also investigated the role of overall bacterial load on hallmarks of steatohepatitis showing that gut bacterial load reduction attenuated immune cell infiltration steatotic accumulation and inflammation in the liver.

additionally alcohol consumption leads to intestinal bacterial dys- biosis and bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine in humans as well as in mouse models of alcohol consumption  .

the liver is a primary site for removal of bacteria and bacterial products  that translocate across the intestinal barrier and into the portal circulation .once in the liver bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide lps activate tlr-4 signaling pathways and initiate an innate immune response thereby augmenting the damage caused by alcohol's primary insult on hepatocytes  .

this analysis identifies reduc- tion of akkermansia as an early marker of alcohol-induced changes in the gut microbiome.antibiotic treatment reduces serum endotoxin and gut bacterial loadintestinal microbiota and bacterial products are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease  .

to directly test the impact of gut bacterial load on alcohol-induced inflamma- tion we first used an antibiotic cocktail to reduce the intestinal bacterial flora.

suppres- sion of circulating bacterial components such as endotoxinlps reduces the inflammatory signaling in the liver that would normally attract immune cells such as neutrophils to the site of liver injury.we describe the protective role of antibiotic-mediated reduction in bacterial load in alco- hol-induced inflammatory signaling steatotic changes and neutrophil infiltration in the liver.

it is possible that the remaining bacterial composition con- tained protective species although we could not sequence these populations due to the low yield of bacterial dna or that the remaining bacteria may serve a homeostatic function in either intestinal metabolism or barrier maintenance .in our study we observe changes in the liver including inflammatory cytokine expression elevated markers of liver injury and immune cell infiltration in the alcohol-fed mice despite relatively stable communities of gut bacteria i.e.

this suggests that while some features of alcoholic liver disease may be related to shifts in the gut bacterial composition seen over the long-term there are other features such as inflammation signaling and immune cell infiltration and hepatocyte injury that may be independent of bacterial diversity changes.

16s rdna sequencing defined the bacterial communities in the cecum of alcohol- and pair-fed animals.

liver neutrophils cytokines and steatosis were evaluated.resultsacute-on-chronic alcohol administration induced shifts in various bacterial phyla in the cecum including increased actinobacteria and a reduction in verrucomicrobia driven entirely by a reduction in the genus akkermansia.

antibiotic treatment reduced the gut bac- terial load and circulating bacterial wall component lipopolysaccharide lps.

we found that bacterial load suppression prevented alcohol-related increases in the number of myeloper- oxidase- mpo positive infiltrating neutrophils in the liver.

this model is emphasized for its replication of neutrophil infiltration in the liver mimicking acute steatohepatitis in human patients  but it is not known if alcohol-related changes in the intestine such as dysbiosis are replicated in this new model.we hypothesized that enteric bacterial products play an important role in acute alcoholic hepatitis as demonstrated in the acute-on-chronic model of steatohepatitis in mice.
