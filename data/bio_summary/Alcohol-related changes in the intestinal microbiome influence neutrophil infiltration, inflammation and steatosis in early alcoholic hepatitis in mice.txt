Additionally alcohol consumption leads to intestinal bacterial dys- biosis and bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine in humans as well as in mouse models of alcohol consumption  .

Indeed Akkermansia has been found to be decreased in mouse models of obesity and type-2 diabetes while supplementation with the bacteria alleviated the burden of metabolic dysfunction .Beyond the effects of alcohol on cecal bacterial community changes we also investigated the role of overall bacterial load on hallmarks of steatohepatitis showing that gut bacterial load reduction attenuated immune cell infiltration steatotic accumulation and inflammation in the liver.

We conclude that gut microbes influence liver inflammation neutrophil infiltration and liver steatosis following alcohol consumption and these data further emphasize the role of the gut-liver axis in early alcoholic liver disease.IntroductionThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that 17 million adults in the US have an alcohol use disorder approximately 1.4 million adults receive treatment for this disorder and close to 88000 people die each year of alcohol related causes .

The liver is a primary site for removal of bacteria and bacterial products  that translocate across the intestinal barrier and into the portal circulation .Once in the liver bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide LPS activate TLR-4 signaling pathways and initiate an innate immune response thereby augmenting the damage caused by alcohol's primary insult on hepatocytes  .

Other fam- ilies with reduced abundance in alcohol-fed mice included Lachnospiraceae and a-diversity of cecal bacterial content.Single rarefaction at a depth of 10000 sequences indicated no significant difference in a-diversity between pair- and ethanol-fed cecal bacterial communities by four different metrics.Alcohol induces shifts in various bacterial phyla.

Significant reduction in the number of colony forming units CFUs in antibiotic-treated mice  confirmed intesti- nal bacterial decontamination.Neutrophil infiltration to the liver is attenuated in mice with reduced gut bacterial loadHaving established a reduction in bacterial load and circulating LPS we hypothesized that this might reduce hepatic inflammation.

Liver neutrophils cytokines and steatosis were evaluated.ResultsAcute-on-chronic alcohol administration induced shifts in various bacterial phyla in the cecum including increased Actinobacteria and a reduction in Verrucomicrobia driven entirely by a reduction in the genus Akkermansia.

Together these data offer critical information regarding the gut-liver axis and its role in alcoholic liver disease and in a frequently used alcohol feeding model.MethodsMice and alcohol feedingAll animals were cared for in strict accordance with the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol specific to the procedures described in this study at the Univer- sity of Massachusetts Medical School Protocol A-1154-14 G.S.. Wild-type C57BL6 6- toweeks-old female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were cohoused in the University of Massachusetts Medical School Animal Medicine Facility for one week prior to the start of the experiment at which time they were doubly housed.

The primers used are listed in and 18S was used as a housekeeping gene for 2-ddCt method of RNA expression analysis.ResultsAlpha- and beta-diversity of cecal microbiome are unaltered by acute- on-chronic alcohol feedingWe applied 16S rDNA sequencing to define and to assess the changes in the cecal microbiota induced by the acute-on-chronic alcohol feeding in mice.
