Although the relative concentrations of amino acid and alkane presented a growth trend in AF the relative concentrations were both 3 at the end of AF and AAF.The changes in ethanol in AF and AAF were analyzed by HPLC Fig.

The indices involv- ing observed genera Chao and ACE showed that microbial richness increased in the first 7 days of AF and then decreased until the end of AF.

Saccharomyces increased to 94.5 in the 4th day of AF and then decreased to 71.1 in the 12th day of AF.

The bacterial genera relative abundance 0.1 decreased from 17 in daqu starter used in starch saccharification to 2 at the 12th day of alcohol fernemtation AF.

The technique of traditional SAV involves the preparation of starter daqu com- posed of barley and pea by spontaneous microbial growth on or in approximately 60 of the raw material starch saccharification SS with starter daqu alcoholic fermentation AF acetic acid fermentation AAF smoking leaching and aging .

SS and AF are performed simultaneously after mixing with daqu powder and water.

With added water yeasts grow rapidly in AF.

At the end of AF production auxiliary materials involving pea wheat bran millet bran and rice hull are added to increase porosity for oxygen uptake and heat discharge.

The whole fermentation process including SS AF and AAF generally lasts approximately 20-30 days.

Therefore the correlations between microbial succession and metabolite changes in the two fermentation stages AF and AAF should be further explored to unravel the fermentation mechanism of traditional SAV.In this study we tried to establish 1 how metabolites changed along with the succession of microbial commu-nity during the fermentation process of SAV and 2 the correlation between metabolite changes and the variation of microbial community.ResultsBacterial diversity and community succession in SAV fermentation.
