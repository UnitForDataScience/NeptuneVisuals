Thus we administered oral FMT to an animal with chronic diarrhoea caused by C. difficile this is a novel method for the treatment of gut microbiota disturbances in this species.Case presentationA male colony-bred common marmoset weighing 420 g that was 2 y and 2 m of age experienced chronicc The Authors.

This small pri- mate could be a valid model for the study of C. difficile infections and effective treatments including FMT in human patients.AbbreviationsFMT Faecal microbiota transplantation C. difficile Clostridium difficileAcknowledgementsThe authors thank Masakado Saiki Masayuki Inada Taku Koike and Reiko Nakatomi for the data collection.FundingThis work was supported by Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies BrainMINDS at RIKEN Japan and the Science Research Promotion Fund for Private University at Azabu University Japan from the Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology of Japan MEXT.Availability of data and materialsThe dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is included within the article.Authors' contributionsYY designed and executed the experiments YY and SK wrote the main manuscript text and prepared the figures and HM TK and AI coordinated the manuscript writing.

C. difficile infection has not been observed in other animals in that breeding room.In addition to the cessation of diarrhoea after the FMT treatment the marmoset recovered from sinusitis and bilateral dacryocystitis which had developed after the surgery for unknown reasons.

with no recurrence during the 10 months after FMT.Discussion and ConclusionsChronic and severe diarrhoea caused by C. difficile infection was terminated after 4 days of oral intake of faecal microbiota collected from healthy individuals.

The subject re- covered from diarrhoea 1 month after termination of the antibiotic.

The diarrhoea decreased slightly during and after the medication as illustrated by After Metronidazole I AMI -10 in Fig.

At this point we tested the faecal sample Techlab C Diff Quick Chek Complete Alere Chiba Japan and confirmed that it was positive for C. difficile antigen and toxin.

although the C. difficile test was still positive for antigen and toxin.
