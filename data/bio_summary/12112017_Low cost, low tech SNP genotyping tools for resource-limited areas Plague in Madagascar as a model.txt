The SNP allele state profiles of genetic subgroups targeted for agarose MAMA design where the Derived SNP state is shaded and Ancestral state is unshaded.aDescribed in Vogler et al 2011 and Vogler et al 2017 bCorresponds to levels indicated in in this study.

Given that Y. pestis is a re-emerging public health threat in Madagascar - and other developing African nations performing SNP typing studies through the use of agarose- MAMA tools could lead to greatly improved epidemiological investigations and to more effec- tive disease management.Here we describe how we resolved technological limitations that prevented Y. pestis SNP genotyping studies at IPM by 1 re-designing a SNP-based Y. pestis genotyping system from melt-MAMA real-time platform to agarose-MAMA to be compatible with existing resources in Madagascar and 2 validating these genetic tools at IPM for adoption.

We assessed the limit of detection of our MAMA tools on these five human clinical samples by testing them on a new TaqMan assay designed for the chromosomal 3a gene and .To confirm the specificity of the assays to the Y. pestis genome we tested assay performance on DNA extracts of Bacillus anthracis human DNA background and no template waterPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases  December 11 201713  19ContinuedaSNP position and naming as published in Vogler et al.

Popular platforms for SNP typing use real-time PCR instruments that employ Dual Probe TaqMan assays or melt- MAMA SNP assays -.

Black bars indicate the phylogenetic positions of the 18 SNPs targeted for MAMA PCR design in this study.to conduct SNP studies to obtain bacterial phenotype information such as antibiotic resistance or phylogenetic information to more robustly understand the dynamics of disease transmis- sion and potentially identify sources of human infections.The phylogeny of Y. pestis in Madagascar has recently expanded  to include more phy- logenetic groups  and the 18 assays developed for this study define a subset of these phy- logenetic groups or lineages as illustrated on a simplified phylogeny .

Molecular confir- mation of Y. pestis in five clinical samples was based on PCR detection of the pla gene located in a high copy number plasmid PCP1 in addition to positive F1 RDT .SNP groupsEighteen previously published SNPs  specific or canonical  for a subset of distinct phylogenetic groups within the Y. pestis Malagasy phylogeny  were selected as the targets of agarose MAMA genotyping assays following published guidelines .
