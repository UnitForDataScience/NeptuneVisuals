In light of current next generation sequencing technologies Illumina and Roche which allow sequencing of only 500 nucleotides out of the 1500 nucleotide-long 16S rRNA gene primers are chosen for amplification products consisting of either V1-V2 V3-V5 or V6-V9 regions each showing bias for particular taxa.Some groups prefer the V1-V2 regionwhich shows an increased bias for Clostridium and decreased bias for certain Bacteroidetes species while other groups prefer the V4 V3-V4 and V3-V5 regions which demonstrate the least biased classifica- tion of bacterial taxa.Gut microbiota in MSIn the last few years several groups including ours have profiled fecal gut microbiota from MS patients and have shown that MS patients exhibit gut microbial dysbiosis with both depletion and enrichment of certain bacteria compared with healthy controls .

Altered gut microbiota might be one of the major missing envi- ronmental factors contributing to MS because evi- dence suggests that certain gut microbiota might be linked to either disease susceptibility or protection.Gut microbiome and human healthHuman Microbiome Project HMP a National Insti- tutes of Health initiative to catalog microbial flora in healthy individuals has shown that large microbialcommunities residing within or on the human body play a major role in both health and disease.Human beings could be considered a superorganism encom- passing both human genome and microbiome micro- bial communities their genome proteins and metabolites.The gut microbiota functions like a bioreactor that influences nutrient uptake food metabolism energy homeostasis and shaping mucosal as well as systemic immune responses .

also reported that Acinetobacter calcoaceticus showing higher abundance in MS patients was able to suppress differen- tiation of regulatory CD4 T cells and induce differentia- tion of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine.Pseudomonas aeruginosa a member of the Pseudomonas genus is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and has been linked with several diseases including MS. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to have amino acid homol- ogy with myelin basic protein a major component of myelin and anti-sera against myelin basic protein resi- dues 110-124 were shown to be reactive against Pseudo- monas peptide from carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase.Additionally higher abundance of Pseu- domonas aeruginosa was reported in mice on a high-fat diet suggesting a role in high-fat diet-induced obesityand inflammation.The role of Mycoplana in health or disease is unknown.ConclusionIt is difficult to say with certainty whether changes in gut microbiota is a cause or consequence of MS because MS patients have immunological and micro- bial changes months to years before clinical onset of the disease.

Only one study has followed patients longitudinally up to 19 months and observed that more frequent relapses in pediatric MS patients were associated with a higher abundance of Firmicutes .Within Actinobacteria phyla we observed a lower abundance of Adlercreutzia equolifaciens and Collinsella in MS patients.

In recent years several groups including ours have evalu- ated a role of the gut microbiota in MS patients by ana- lyzing 16S-rRNA metagenomic sequencingFigure 1.

observed depletion of Prevotella copri in RRMS patients on interferon b-1b treatment.The reduced abundance of Prevotella observed across multi- ple MS microbiome studies in different geographical locations suggests this bacterium might have an impor- tant anti-inflammatory role in RRMS patients.Among Firmicutes some genera were depleted whereas others were enriched in RRMS patients.
