in light of current next generation sequencing technologies illumina and roche which allow sequencing of only 500 nucleotides out of the 1500 nucleotide-long 16s rrna gene primers are chosen for amplification products consisting of either v1-v2 v3-v5 or v6-v9 regions each showing bias for particular taxa.some groups prefer the v1-v2 regionwhich shows an increased bias for clostridium and decreased bias for certain bacteroidetes species while other groups prefer the v4 v3-v4 and v3-v5 regions which demonstrate the least biased classifica- tion of bacterial taxa.gut microbiota in msin the last few years several groups including ours have profiled fecal gut microbiota from ms patients and have shown that ms patients exhibit gut microbial dysbiosis with both depletion and enrichment of certain bacteria compared with healthy controls .

altered gut microbiota might be one of the major missing envi- ronmental factors contributing to ms because evi- dence suggests that certain gut microbiota might be linked to either disease susceptibility or protection.gut microbiome and human healthhuman microbiome project hmp a national insti- tutes of health initiative to catalog microbial flora in healthy individuals has shown that large microbialcommunities residing within or on the human body play a major role in both health and disease.human beings could be considered a superorganism encom- passing both human genome and microbiome micro- bial communities their genome proteins and metabolites.the gut microbiota functions like a bioreactor that influences nutrient uptake food metabolism energy homeostasis and shaping mucosal as well as systemic immune responses .

in recent years several groups including ours have evalu- ated a role of the gut microbiota in ms patients by ana- lyzing 16s-rrna metagenomic sequencingfigure 1. role of the gut microbiota in health and disease.microbiota studies have used either sequencing of a small region within the 16s rrna gene of bacteria or phylochip analysis a microarray-based method that uses probes for the 16s rrna region of known micro- bial taxa  50000 .

also reported that acinetobacter calcoaceticus showing higher abundance in ms patients was able to suppress differen- tiation of regulatory cd4 t cells and induce differentia- tion of pro-inflammatory th1 cytokine.pseudomonas aeruginosa a member of the pseudomonas genus is a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and has been linked with several diseases including ms. pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to have amino acid homol- ogy with myelin basic protein a major component of myelin and anti-sera against myelin basic protein resi- dues 110-124 were shown to be reactive against pseudo- monas peptide from carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase.additionally higher abundance of pseu- domonas aeruginosa was reported in mice on a high-fat diet suggesting a role in high-fat diet-induced obesityand inflammation.the role of mycoplana in health or disease is unknown.conclusionit is difficult to say with certainty whether changes in gut microbiota is a cause or consequence of ms because ms patients have immunological and micro- bial changes months to years before clinical onset of the disease.

only one study has followed patients longitudinally up to 19 months and observed that more frequent relapses in pediatric ms patients were associated with a higher abundance of firmicutes .within actinobacteria phyla we observed a lower abundance of adlercreutzia equolifaciens and collinsella in ms patients.

a healthy gut microbiota is characterized by its diversity species richness and resilience box 1. the gut microbiota helps in keeping a healthy state in multiple ways including maintenance of an intact intestinal barrier inhibition of colonization by pathogenic organisms and regulation of host physiology and immune responses.alteration of the gut micro- biota and subsequent changes in its metabolic network perturb this homeostasis leading to negative conse- quences that may result in intestinal and systemic dis- orders.

k. shahi et al.phylochip analysis of fecal dna samplesor rnaseq analysis of biopsies from brain white matter.methods used for gut microbiota profiling in ms patientsthe development of low-cost culture-independent analyses with improved dna sequencing methods has led to rapid development in the investigation of gut microbiota profiling studies in the last decade an achievement due in large part to the hmp.the majority of bacteria 90 in adult human gut belong to firmicutes or bacteroidetes phyla with the remaining belonging to actinobacteria proteobacte-ria and few other phyla.the majority of ms gutarchaea and fungi.

global and deep molecular analysis of microbiota signatures in fecal sam- ples from patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

observed depletion of prevotella copri in rrms patients on interferon b-1b treatment.the reduced abundance of prevotella observed across multi- ple ms microbiome studies in different geographical locations suggests this bacterium might have an impor- tant anti-inflammatory role in rrms patients.among firmicutes some genera were depleted whereas others were enriched in rrms patients.

did not find a difference in adlercreutzia they did report depletion of collinsella and slackia in ms patients.with regard to proteobacteria we observed enrichment of mycoplana and pseudomo- nas in ms patients miyake et al.reported higher abundance of bilophila in ms patients and ceka- naviciute et al.observed higher abundance of aci- netobacter calcoaceticus.

parabacter- oides distasonis had been also shown to convert naeurive humancd4t cells into il-10 producing cd4 cd25 regulatory t cells.one of the metabolic pathways used by prevo- tella and parabacteroides as well as adlercreutzia which is also depleted in ms patients is metabo- lism of phytoestrogens.it is important to note that estrogens have been shown to possess disease- suppressive properties in ms as evidenced bygut microbes613several studies in animals as well as in ms patients.

this observation has led to an increased emphasis for a detailed understanding of the mecha- nism by which the gut microbiota regulates host metabolism and immune responses.
