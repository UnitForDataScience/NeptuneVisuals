Bezlotoxumab a human monoclonal antibody binds to C. difficile toxin B TcdB reducing recurrence presumably by limiting epithe- lial damage and facilitating microbiome recovery.NAMEBezlotoxumab ZinplavaAPPROVED FORAdjuvant therapy to reduce recurrence of CDI in high-risk patients receiving antimicrobial therapy for CDITYPEBezlotoxumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibodyMOLECULAR TARGETSTcdB a protein toxin produced by C. difficile that glycosylates host Rho family GTPasesCELLULAR TARGETSNo demonstrated cellular targets presumably protects host cells from intoxication with TcdBEFFECTS ON TARGETSBezlotoxumab binds to TcdB and inhibits its ability to bind to its cellular surface receptors.

Antibody-bound TcdB exhibits reduced cell entry and decreased subsequent glycosylation of the Rho family of GTPases which are the host cell targets of TcdB.DEVELOPED BYMerck Sharp  Dohme Corp.Cost of care 200 millionRecurrent casesper year in U.S.Cost of care                        C. difficile treatment with antibiotics aloneC.

YoungUniversity of Michigan Medical School Ann Arbor MI 48103 USA Correspondence mdieterlmed.umich.edu Clostridium difficile infection CDI is facilitated by alteration of the microbiome following antibiotic adminis- tration.

Unfortunately 20 of successfully treated patients will suffer recurrence.

Bezlotoxumab is proposed to bind to the N-terminal domain putative cell-binding region of TcdB.
