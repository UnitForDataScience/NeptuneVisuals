Collectively these observations suggest that the substitution of whole grains for refined grains in the diet in amounts that exceed current dietary recommendations and in- crease fiber intake from the population mean to recommended amounts increases stool output which in turn increases energy loss in the stool.To our knowledge this study is the first to examine the effectsof whole grains compared with refined grains on energy me- tabolism during weight stability.
