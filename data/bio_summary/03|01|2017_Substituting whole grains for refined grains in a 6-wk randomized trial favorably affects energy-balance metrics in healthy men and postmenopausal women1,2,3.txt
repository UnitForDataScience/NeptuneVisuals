Ad- ditional study limitations are as follows OGTT and CGM measurements were conducted in a self-selected subset of the full cohort which resulted in these analyses being underpow- ered nutrient databases were used to determine the energy contents and compositions of study diets and a mean value was used for the combustible energy of fiber to correct stool energy values.In conclusion to our knowledge these findings provide newevidence of energetic benefits and improved oral glucose toler- ance when whole grains replace refined grains in the diet.

During the subsequent 6 wk participants were provided with either a weight-maintaining whole grain-rich diet whole grain-rich diet group WG10 or a weight-maintaining refined grain-based diet weight-maintaining refined grain-based diet group RG that did not contain any whole grains.Study diets and dietary adherenceThe run-in diet contained no whole grains and was designed to be consistent with the mean dietary intakes of US adults.

The weight-maintaining whole grain-rich diet and weight- maintaining refined grain-based diet were designed to differ in whole-grain and fiber contents but to be otherwise similar in energy and macronutrient compositions types of provided10 Abbreviations used CGM continuous glucose monitoring FDR false- discovery rate Glucose-OGTTAUC AUC of the serum glucose response OGTT oral-glucose-tolerance test RG refined grain-based diet group RMR resting metabolic rate WG whole grain-rich diet group.foods and meal structures Table 1 Supplemental Table 1.

Collectively these observations suggest that the substitution of whole grains for refined grains in the diet in amounts that exceed current dietary recommendations and in- crease fiber intake from the population mean to recommended amounts increases stool output which in turn increases energy loss in the stool.To our knowledge this study is the first to examine the effectsof whole grains compared with refined grains on energy me- tabolism during weight stability.

When nonadherent participants were excluded between-group differences in stool energy content and glucose tolerance increased and between-group differences in the RMR and prospective consumption were not statistically significant.Conclusion These findings suggest positive effects of whole grainson the RMR and stool energy excretion that favorably influence energy balance and may help explain epidemiologic associations between whole-grain consumption and reduced body weight andadiposity.

We hypothesized that the substitution of whole grains for refined grains within a weight- maintaining diet would have broadly beneficial effects on energy regulation including appetite suppression an increased metabolic rate and energy loss in the stool and improved glycemia.METHODSThis trial was conducted at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University between May 2012 and September 2014 and received approval from the Tufts University Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.
