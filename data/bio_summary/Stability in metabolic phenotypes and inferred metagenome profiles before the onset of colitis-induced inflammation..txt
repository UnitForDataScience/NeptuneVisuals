Further to this relative concentrations of previously reported influential metabolites such as glutamine phenylalanine and succinate -were comparable between WT and mdr1a-- mice at 18 weeks despite the appearance of signs of inflammation in mdr1a-- mice Supplementary Fig.

Further work to ensure that sufficient material is obtained to enable full struc- tural characterisation and identification of the potential metabolic biomarkers detected in the urinary profiles of these mice will be required as part of any effort to translate this work to humans.Collectively the findings of the present study demonstrate that the activity of microbial communities and uri- nary metabolites are remarkably stable in mdr1a-- mice in the face of ensuing gut inflammation despite changes in mucus microbial community composition.

At 6 weeks of age although all mice were histologically normal with no expres- sion of Interferon g microbial composition was altered in the mucus but not in the stools of mdr1a-- mice in contrast to WT controls at 6 weeks of age approximately 12 weeks before signs of intestinal inflammation are detected.

Within this untargeted approach we took advantage of the method to also look for changes in endogenous metabolites that had been highlighted in previous publications to be significantly changed in human and murine IBD studies in order to determine if there were similar differences in mdr1a-- mice before and during the onset of inflammation Supplementary Table .

As mdr1a-- mice are prone to colitis development as they age  differences observed in metabolites not affiliated with inflammation could indicate a predictive risk of IBD.DiscussionIBD is associated with an altered gut microbiota composition which may also be translated to an altered meta- bolic activity in the gut .

Hence the analysis of metabolites in urine offers a relatively non-invasive means by which systemic changes seen before and during IBD can be investigated.We have previously shown that changes in gut microbiota profiles in the mucus but not in faeces precede onset of inflammation in colitis-prone mice.

Since analysis centred on previously reported metabolites takes into account only a tiny fraction of the urinary metabolite profile we also performed an untargeted analysis on all of the data acquired to examine a wider pool of metabolites.

The fact that changes in metabolites previously associated with gut inflammation were not observed suggests that these genotype-affiliated metabolites could constitute a predictive risk of IBD in at least a subset of patients carrying MDR1A polymorphisms and warrants further investigation to identify the metabolites and pathways involved as part of further studies on this mouse model of colitis.

Urine samples were collected from mice at designated time points in clean autoclaved cages or by injection in the bladder during culling and stored at -80 degC n 18 WT 6 weeks n  18 mdr1a-- 6 weeks n  17 WT 18 weeks n 12 mdr1a-- 18 weeks.

LC- MS-based metabolic phenotyping metabotyping in urine samples confirmed that metabolite profiles in mdr1a-- mice were remarkably unaffected by development of intestinal inflammation and there were no differences in previously published metabolic markers of IBD.
