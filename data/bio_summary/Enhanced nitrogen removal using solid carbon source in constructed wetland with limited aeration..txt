System NA non-aerated CW System A limited aeration CW.NH4-N removal performance in System NA 1.66 mgL and 63.60 System A had significantly better performance p  0.05.

The limited aeration increased the DO in System A and constructed adequate environment for microorganism  which led to the higher microbial abundance in System A.The copy numbers of amoA gene in System A was higher than System NA.

The coverage of microbial species in two samples was higher than 99.23 indicating that the pyrosequencing analysis was trustworthy and effectively reflected the microbial com- munity structure.The Ace index evaluating the richness of microbial community obtained a higher value in System A which indicated the higher rich- ness of microbial community in System A.

The higher Shannon index in the System A indicated that a more diverse microbial community in System A .

The higher DO in System A resulted in the lower relative abundance of Brevinema and the Brevinema might have the function of degrading organic compounds under anaerobic conditions.In System NA and System A Dechloromonas and Desulfovibrio hadthe similar relative abundance respectively.

Higher ammonia removal efficiency 91.00 and total nitrogen removal efficiency 97.03 than non-aerated constructed wetland System NA were achieved in constructed wetland with limited aeration System A.

And System A had higher microbial abundance than System NA.

Pyrosequencing analysis showed that denitrifying bacteria Brevinema 41.85 and Thiothrix 12.33 were the predominant genus in the biofilm attached on the carbon source in System NA and System A respectively.IntroductionConstructed wetlands CWs are systems designed and constructed to treat wastewater using natural processes within controlled environ- ment .

A lot of soluble carbon sources such as methanol  fructose   and hydrolyzed sludge  have been utilized as external carbon sources to stimulate the denitrification.
