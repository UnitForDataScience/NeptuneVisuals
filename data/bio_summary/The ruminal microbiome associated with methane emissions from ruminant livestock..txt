in total archaea was negatively associated with methane production in sheep although not in beef cattle thus differing methane emissions are at least partly due to varying relative abundances within the community of methanogenic archaea.other observations regarding the archaeal community sometimes called the archaeome include those of pitta et al.

it should be noted here that we have chosen to express ch4 production in terms of dmi for thesimple reason that it makes it easier to identify a low-ch4 microbiome rather than a microbiome that forms less ch4 only because the host animal eats less.the results of microbiome analysis so far were expected in some respects in the sense that diets high in starch content are known to lead to lower methane emissions because starch utilising bacteria tend to produce less h2 than others for example in a similar way the changed fermentation stoichiometry linked with methane emissions is a very long established observation new questions have been highlighted regarding different species associated with high and low ch4 emissions under similar conditions.

bovine host genetic variation influences rumen microbial methane production with best selection criterion for low methane emitting and efficiently feed converting hosts based on metagenomic gene abundance.

the less abundant methylotrophs methanosarci- nales methanosphaera methanomassiliicoccaceae can use methylamines and methanol and there are archaea methanosarcinales that produce methane via the aceti- clastic pathway reviewed in morgavi et al.

shi et al.and danielsson all found a positive correlation between the relative abundance of methanobrevibacter sgmt clade and methane emissions.

furthermore it might be expected to improve animal production efficiency.ruminal community analysis relating to methane emissionsarchaeathere are two main routes for methanogenesis in the rumen both carried out by archaea.

rumen methanogenic archaeal diversity is restricted to four orders  and is highly conserved across 32 ruminant species collected worldwide .intuitively archaea should be the microbial group most closely correlated with methane emissions.

and danielsson found no correspondence between the numbers of methanogens and methane emissions from dairy cows when measured using metagenomics and qpcr techniques.

also observed that archaeal gene expression rather than gene abundance was correlated to methane emissions fromindividual sheep.

it is easy to see why gene expression might be a useful proxy for methanogenesis in a static system like soil but less so in a flowing system like the rumen where for physiological reasons biomass must be directly correlated to gene abundance unless other processes such as uncoupled ch4 production occur given the high variability of the relationship with over- all archaeal abundance it may be that the composition of the archaeal community rather than just its size may have greater significance with regard to methane emis- sions.

several studies suggested a correlation between the abundance of protozoa and methane emissions collated in    while others do not  .
