in total archaea was negatively associated with methane production in sheep although not in beef cattle Thus differing methane emissions are at least partly due to varying relative abundances within the community of methanogenic archaea.Other observations regarding the archaeal community sometimes called the archaeome include those of Pitta et al.

Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology 2017 87DOI 10.1186s40104-017-0141-0The ruminal microbiome associated with methane emissions from ruminant livestockIlma Tapio1 Timothy J. Snelling2 Francesco Strozzi3 and R. John Wallace2BackgroundMethane is a greenhouse gas GHG with a global warming potential 28-fold that of carbon dioxide Agriculture makes a significant contribution to total GHG production with estimates varying according to country and calculation method Nonetheless a global contribution of between 7 and 18 of total an- thropogenic GHG emissions is generally accepted  Ruminant production accounts for about 81 of GHG from the livestock sector calculated from Hristov et al.

The less abundant methylotrophs Methanosarci- nales Methanosphaera Methanomassiliicoccaceae can use methylamines and methanol and there are archaea Methanosarcinales that produce methane via the aceti- clastic pathway reviewed in Morgavi et al.

It should be noted here that we have chosen to express CH4 production in terms of DMI for thesimple reason that it makes it easier to identify a low-CH4 microbiome rather than a microbiome that forms less CH4 only because the host animal eats less.The results of microbiome analysis so far were expected in some respects in the sense that diets high in starch content are known to lead to lower methane emissions because starch utilising bacteria tend to produce less H2 than others for example In a similar way the changed fermentation stoichiometry linked with methane emissions is a very long established observation New questions have been highlighted regarding different species associated with high and low CH4 emissions under similar conditions.

Links between methane flux and transcriptional activities of methanogens and methane oxidizers in a blanket peat bog.

Metagenomic analysis of the rumen microbial community following inhibition of methane formation by a halogenated methane analog.

Bovine host genetic variation influences rumen microbial methane production with best selection criterion for low methane emitting and efficiently feed converting hosts based on metagenomic gene abundance.

Shi et al.and Danielsson all found a positive correlation between the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter SGMT clade and methane emissions.
