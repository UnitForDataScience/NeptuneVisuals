found that the maxillary sinus mucosa is not devoid of bacteria 46.7 of positive results from swabs 41.2 of positive results from the sinus mucosa .Reports in the literature on the state of paranasal sinus mucosa in healthy subjects is limited.

Therefore identifying the consequences of the presence of oppor- tunistic bacteria on the mucosa in the carriers in relation to the reaction to pathogenic bacteria requires further studies.However the bacteria film in contrast to typical biofilm might be defined by the presence of bacteria that growth in colonies without inducing the inflammatory response.

Because thebiofilm is detected on healthy individuals sinus mucosa the clinical question if it may become pathogenic is unclear and require an explanation.IntroductionThe bacterial biofilm is typically defined as the concentration of microorganisms superficially associated and surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances EPS.

This phenome- non could be explained by the theory of specific mucous characteristics in healthy subjects .ConclusionsIn conclusion the present study increased our knowledge of the presence and size of biofilm on the healthy maxillary sinus mucosa.

In the maxillary sinuses of healthy subjects the biofilm is merely an element iden- tified most often on the interface of the layer of the mucosa and cilia.The presence of bacterial microcolonies in all tested samples seems to be normal for the mucosal tissue of healthy individuals.

Usually colonization is defined as the presence of bacteria on the mucous membrane and the lack of the inflammatory response distinguishes it from an infection .The Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley studies indicate that the establishment of the biofilm may be a form of a bacterial carrier state and its presence is in contrast to the infectious form of the bacteria .This problem is particularly difficult because of the small number of clinical trials on the biofilm in healthy subjects.

Pathological flora in swabs from the nasal mucosa or pathological lesions of the paranasal sinus mucosa were the main exclusion criteria from the study.

In most cases the bacterial film was mostly composed of diplococci-like and streptococci-like structures on the mucosa of the paranasal sinus.

The direct examination of tissue demonstrates aggregated cells in cell clusters encased in a matrix.ResultsScanning electron microscope investigations revealed the presence of bacterial film on the sur- face of maxillary sinus mucosa in 30 patients.
