To lend further support to the fermentation hypothesis for animal signalling we now couple deep sequencing techniques with chemical analyses of those secretions to more directly link host-bacteria relationships to chemical signals.We first use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GCMS to test for volatile chemical differences between the pure glandular secretions and the mixtures contained within the anal pouch of adult meerkats.

We therefore restricted our analyses of chemical and bacterial covar- iation to those chemical compounds that had lower retention time than that of nonadecane C19H40 molecu- lar weight 268 D. In addition because pure anal-gland secretions were sampled from subordinates only we restricted the comparison between pure secretions and mixtures to subordinate meerkats.We performed all statistical analyses using the R statistical softwareand express values as mean -stand- ard error SE throughout.

When comparing pure glandular secretions to mixtures obtained from the anal pouch of subordinate meerkats only we detected a total of 222 different chemical compounds in the 31 sam- ples of pure secretions and similarly a total of 218 compounds in the 24 samples of mixed secretions.

Bacterial distance was calculated using a all OTUs or b the 7 OTUs that best explained the males' chemical profiles.DiscussionCoupling deep sequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene with chemical analyses of meerkat glandular secre- tions we provide a rare exploration of the patterns within and relationships between the host's volatile chemical signals and its bacterial assemblages.

Across sexes four of the eight OTUs that best explained the chemical composition of anal-pouch mixtures belonged to the genus Porphyromonas some of whose members are known to generate volatile fatty acidsor oral malodour in humans.As detected in wild hyaenas we also found that the bacterial assemblages and volatile chemical profiles covaried among individual meerkats albeit principally within males.

Second because these mixtures are more likely than pure secretions to resemble the actual scent marks that are deposited in the environment we next relate the volatile chemical profiles of the mixtures to various meerkat attributes including sex social status and group membership.

we found that genes controlling lipid metabolism were enriched in dom- inant males compared to subordinate males and to females of either social class sexsocial status F138  11.0 P  0.003 all Tukey post hoc tests comparing dominant males with other meerkat categories P  0.04.Lastly consistent with prior findings based on DNA fingerprint analyses of similar samples the composition of bacterial communities in anal-pouch mixtures also varied with the host's group membership F1028  1.28 P  0.022 Fig.

The greater abundance of these compounds in anal-pouch mixtures than in pure glandular secretions might also reflect a bacterial origin consistent with the meerkats' sex difference in bacterial assemblages.These sex differences in the hosts' microbiota owed mainly to a Corynebacterium OTU052676 being in greater proportion in females than males and to a proteobacterium OTU063212 being in greater proportion in males than females.

We used linear models to determine if OTUrichness and chemical compound richness were related to the animal's sex social class the two-way interaction between these two factors or to the animal's group membership.We evaluated covariance between chemical compounds and bacterial assemblages in mixed paste using Mantel tests VEGAN package in R. When the covariance was significant we used the bv.step procedure in R equivalent to the BVSTEP procedure in BEST in the software PRIMERto select the combination of OTUs that best explained the chemical composition of odorants.
