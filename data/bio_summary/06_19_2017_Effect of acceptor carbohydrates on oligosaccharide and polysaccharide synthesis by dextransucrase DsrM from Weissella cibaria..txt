The refractive index increment dndc value of 0.146 mL g-1 was employed .Production of oligosaccharides by DsrM with commercial IMO as acceptorPurified DsrM was incubated with 250 mM sucrose and 3.75 7.5 15 or 30 wv of a commercial IMO preparation mixture in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2 containing 1 mM CaCl2 for 24 h. The enzyme was inactivated and the formation of oligosaccharides was analyzed by HPAEC-PAD.

Values in the same row differ significantly P  0.05 if they do not share a common superscript.a The dndc obtained for isomaltotriose was used to calculate the concentration of other a-glucooligosaccharides.b The oligosaccharide yield was calculated asmol glucose in the initial substrate sucrose .400300200100400300200100Fig.

The efficiency of a-glucans as acceptor carbohydrates decreased in the order DP2  DP3  DP1 among disaccharides the efficiency decreased in the order a-1 - 6  a- 1 - 4  a-1 - 3 the a-1 - 2 linked kojibiose did not support oligosaccharide formation.

The method of production determines DP and the linkage type inIMO and hence the digestibility.

The molecular weight MW of polysaccharides was measured by asymmetric field-flow fractionation AF4 coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering and the digestibility of oligosaccharides was determined in vitro by two methods.Materials and methodsMaterialsMono- di- and trisaccharides and dextran standards were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Oakville ON Canada.

The commercial isomaltooligosaccharide IMO preparation Vitafiberr was provided by BioNeutra Inc. Edmonton Canada.Expression and purification of the recombinant his-tagged DsrM fromW.

The column was washed with 100 mM imida- zole in 100 mM PBS and 300 mM NaCl pH 8.0 DsrM was eluted with elution buffer containing 500 mM imidazole in 100 mM PBS and 300 mM NaCl pH 8.0.

The protein content was measured by Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as standard.Dextransucrase enzyme activity assay and optimization of temperature and pH for the acceptor reaction of sucrose and maltoseDsrM activity was determined as follows Purified enzyme was in- cubated in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2 containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 100 mM sucrose.

The concentration of glucose and fructose was determined enzymatically by glucose assay reagent and the Fructose Assay Kit Sigma-Aldrich.
