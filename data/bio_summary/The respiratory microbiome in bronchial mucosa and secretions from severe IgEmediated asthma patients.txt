Overall 76 out of 280 identified genera showed significant differences between BA and BB samples Table .Table 2 Differences in the relative abundances of the phyla detected in BB and BA samples with median 1 at least in one type of sampleTable 3 Genera with median relative abundances higher than 1 at least in one type of sample showing significant differences between BB and BA higher abundances in bold typesRegarding bacterial a-diversity Chao1 richness parameter did not show differences between BA and BB samples 2056.1 1388.2-2517.2 vs. 1971.41540.1-2217.1 p  0.575 Wilcoxon test and Shan- non index which combines both richness and even- ness was slightly lower in BA samples 5.7 5.1-5.9 vs. 6.9 5.7-7.3 p  0.059 Wilcoxon test Fig.

The existence of substantial differences in the microbiota of bronchial secretions sampled either through sputum or BA and the bronchial mucosa confirms that these compartments should be considered to be different in patients with severe allergic chronic asthma and supports the hypothesis that some of the microbial characteristics of the bronchial mucosa will be missed when only bronchial secretions are sampled in chronic respiratory diseases.The presence in biopsy samples of biofilm-associated bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Legion- ella suggests that biofilm may be present on the bronchial mucosa of severe chronic asthma patients.

Legionella and Haemophilus genera were found in all BB samples with median RA above 2 2.7 1.1-4.8 and 2.1 0.6-4.1 respectively while Pseudomonas genus was only found with median RAs below 1 0.9 0.3-1.9 Table .Comparison between bronchial aspirate BA and biopsy BB samplesIn order to compare BA and BB 10 paired samples from the studied patients were used.

Despite the fact that our results confirm the increase of Proteobacteria abundance in bronchial mucosa previously reported in asthma patients  our patients did not show an overrepresentation of the genera Haemophilus and Pseudomonas which is a frequent characteristic of severe COPD patients and confirms that bronchial micro- biome changes have specific patterns in severe asthma also supported by the extensive identification of high loads of microorganisms from Legionella genus in the patients studied.

Studies of the respiratory microbiome using culture- independent techniques in asthma have mainly described the microbial composition of the bacterial community re- covered from sputum but knowledge of the microbiome lodged in the bronchial mucosa and its functional charac- teristics is incomplete  .Most research on the respiratory microbiome has tar- geted chronic diseases other than asthma and the bac- terial communities living in the bronchial mucosa in severe asthma are largely unknown.

Fusobacteria however showed significantly higher RAs in BA 8.7 5.9-11.4 vs 4.2 0.8-7.5 p  0.037Wilcoxon test while the RA of Proteobacteria was signifi- cantly lower in BA when compared with BB 4.3 3.7-6.5 vs 17.1 11.2-33.4 p  0.005 Wilcoxon test Table .At genus level higher RAs were found in BA for 28 gen- era nine of them with median RAs over 1 and among them Prevotella and Streptococcus attained levels over 20.

Statistical tests used in the study were two-sided and a p value of 0.05 or less was reported as statistically significant.ResultsPatient characteristicsThirteen patients with severe asthma were included in the study and provided 11 BB and 12 BA suitable for sequence analyses.

At KEGG level 2 35 functional categories were detected 24 with significant differences in their RA between BB and BA samples nine higher in BA and 15 in BB Fig.

Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes had RAs over 25 in both BB and BA samples and were the most abundant phyla in both samples but Proteobacteria phylum which attained RAs over 15 in BB samples was significantly less abundant in BA.
