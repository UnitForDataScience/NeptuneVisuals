despite the fact that our results confirm the increase of proteobacteria abundance in bronchial mucosa previously reported in asthma patients  our patients did not show an overrepresentation of the genera haemophilus and pseudomonas which is a frequent characteristic of severe copd patients and confirms that bronchial micro- biome changes have specific patterns in severe asthma also supported by the extensive identification of high loads of microorganisms from legionella genus in the patients studied.

the existence of substantial differences in the microbiota of bronchial secretions sampled either through sputum or ba and the bronchial mucosa confirms that these compartments should be considered to be different in patients with severe allergic chronic asthma and supports the hypothesis that some of the microbial characteristics of the bronchial mucosa will be missed when only bronchial secretions are sampled in chronic respiratory diseases.the presence in biopsy samples of biofilm-associated bacteria such as pseudomonas and legion- ella suggests that biofilm may be present on the bronchial mucosa of severe chronic asthma patients.

studies of the respiratory microbiome using culture- independent techniques in asthma have mainly described the microbial composition of the bacterial community re- covered from sputum but knowledge of the microbiome lodged in the bronchial mucosa and its functional charac- teristics is incomplete  .most research on the respiratory microbiome has tar- geted chronic diseases other than asthma and the bac- terial communities living in the bronchial mucosa in severe asthma are largely unknown.

differences in the bacterial microbiota be- tween biopsy samples obtained from a subsegmentary bronchus and simultaneously recovered bronchial aspi- rates which represent bronchial secretions were assessed in order to determine the regional distribution and functional patterns of the bronchial microbiome in this disease.methodsdesign and populationthis cross-sectional study was part of a project whose objective was the characterization of the bronchial tree in severe ige-mediated chronic asthma and included pa- tients who were members of a cohort regularly attendingan asthma outpatient clinic in a university hospital patients were categorized as step 5 for therapy according to the global initiative for asthma gina  and were receiving oral corticosteroids to con- trol their disease in addition to the usual standard care.

secondly the pa- tients enrolled had severe allergic asthma and were treated with oral corticosteroids and the results ob- tained may not be extrapolable to patients with moder- ate asthma or patients who do not need chronic oral corticosteroid treatment.

statistical tests used in the study were two-sided and a p value of 0.05 or less was reported as statistically significant.resultspatient characteristicsthirteen patients with severe asthma were included in the study and provided 11 bb and 12 ba suitable for sequence analyses.

to our know- ledge the presence of this genus in the bronchial mucosa of patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma has not been previously reported and future studies focusing on its role in patients following regular treatment with corticosteroids will be needed.

firmicutes and bacteroidetes had ras over 25 in both bb and ba samples and were the most abundant phyla in both samples but proteobacteria phylum which attained ras over 15 in bb samples was significantly less abundant in ba.
