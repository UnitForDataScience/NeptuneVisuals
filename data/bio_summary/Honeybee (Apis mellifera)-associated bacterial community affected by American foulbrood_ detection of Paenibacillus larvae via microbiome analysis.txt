For the samples we coded AFB as follows i AFB0 control bees from outside the AFB zone with no signs of AFB ii AFB1 bees from asymptomatic colonies within AFB apiaries and iii AFB2 bees from colonies exhibiting clinical AFB symptoms.

The microbiome was analyzed in workers outside of the AFB zone control - AFB0 in workers from asymptomatic colonies in an AFB apiary AFB1 and in workers from colonies exhibiting clinical AFB symptoms AFB2.

approximately 3000 P. larvae spores per adult bee may represent the threshold for the appearance of clinical AFB symptoms and the same authors observed at least a 2-fold reduction in the number of spores in bees from colonies without clinical symptoms relative to the number in bees from colonies with AFB symptoms.

Figure shows the number of P. larvae sequences in AFB0 AFB1 and AFB2 however the statistical comparison was performed using the relative abundance of P. larvae see OTU3 in Table .As a factor AFB was found to have no or only a marginal effect on the number of OTUs in the total parasitic environmental microbiome datasets the inverse Simpson diversity index was not affected Table .

This result is supported by HTS analyses in other experiments unpublished data unrelated to AFB in some colonies we identified reads corresponding to P. larvae whereas in others no reads corresponding to P. larvae were identi- fied.

It is not surprising that colonies with clinical signs of AFB were dominated by P. larvae and in cases where pupae survive to adulthood these individuals should be considered vectors of P. larvae in their colony.Methodological note - the cut-off microbiome.

The fact that K. pneumoniae and M. plutonius were more abundant in workers from asymptomatic colonies than in either control bees or colonies with AFB symptoms implies an association of these bacteria with the initial stage of AFB development in the colony.

The spores of P. larvae are extremely infectious but colonies differ in their resistance to AFB out- breaks.
