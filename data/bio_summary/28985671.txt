Technical challenges remain in addition to bioengineering the antisense technology itself the systemsTse et al.Page 8will need to be paired with effective delivery systems capable of targeting the bacterial strains of interest eg phage each of which brings its own challenges.CONCLUSIONSNontraditional antimicrobial therapeutics represent a reservoir of novel approaches for the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections and for slowing the development of antimicrobial resistance.

Based upon the observed clinical efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation several microbiome-based approaches to prevent or treat C. difficile-based bacterial infections are now under development.

For example phage can be engineered to carry both the cas9 gene and a programmable RNA guide enabling the selective killing of specific bacterial strains 23 24.Beyond RNGs other antisense technologies have antibacterial potential through the silencing of bacterial gene expression.

However a recent failure of a microbiome-based product in clinical development has cast some doubts on previous assumptions of clinical efficacy 10.Manufacturing and producing microbiome-based therapies present significant challenges.

Unclear regulatory pathways potential for adverse events due to modulation of host immune systems and a lack of preclinical animal and clinical data to validate their utility have hampered their clinical development.

Furthermore innovation in antibacterial drug development has declined no novel class of antibiotics attacking a new bacterial target has entered the market in 45 years for the treatment of gram-negative infections 2.

When these peptides are combined with conventional antibiotics the synergistic effect lowers the concentration of the antibiotic needed to eradicate certain bacterial strains of interest 20-22.However challenges remain to antibiotic potentiation.

A 2016 survey found that there were only 37 antibiotic candidates in clinical development compared to 500 candidates for oncology 2.

Facilitating antibacterial drug development for patients with unmet need and developing antibacterial drugs that target a single species.

The program is currently in phase 3 clinical development.Tse et al.Page 6VIRULENCE DISRUPTORSStrategies that seek to disrupt bacterial virulence factors are also being pursued.
