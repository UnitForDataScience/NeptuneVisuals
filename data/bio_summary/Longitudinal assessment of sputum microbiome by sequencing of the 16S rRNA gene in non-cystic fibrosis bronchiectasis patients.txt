The median copy number was 22 x108 per ml of sputum at baseline IQR 48 x 107-86 x 10 .

The variability in other patients might result from a respiratory tract rendered inhomogeneous by advanced disease which may con- found a whole airway sample such as sputum .

Eighty-five patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and daily sputum production were recruited from outpatient clinics and followed for six months.Monthly sputum samples and clinical measurements were taken together with additional sam- ples during exacerbations.

Only a small number of non- respiratory antibiotics were prescribed to study patients and as these are at a lower dose and likely to have less influence on the microbial communities in the airways these were not included in the BETR definition.Possible explanations for the poor correlation between the sputum microbiome and clinical course include that the disease is driven by mucosal events that are poorly reflected in sputum or that the activity of the microbiome is changing independently of bacterial load for example through expression of virulence factors or that exacerbations are being driven by virus or fungal infections rather than bacteria.

Lack of sputum expectoration was also an issue with T treatment samples as treatment reduced sputum volume.

The clinical data is also available as .AbstractBackgroundBronchiectasis is accompanied by chronic bronchial infection that may drive disease progres- sion.

A simple model of exacerbations driven by bacterial overgrowth was not supportedFunding The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust under WT077959 and WT096964.
