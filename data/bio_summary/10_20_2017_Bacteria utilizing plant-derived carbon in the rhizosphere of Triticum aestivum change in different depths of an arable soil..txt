13c enrichment values were lower in average in the upper subsoil u compared to topsoil or subsoil l. however overall relative abundance of 13c-enriched otus was found to be highest in subsoil u and subsoil l rhizosphere.

different mechanisms of plant growth promotion might fall together in single species and other bacteria in turn benefit from those mutualistic relationships.lack of 13c enrichment in bacterial dna in the upper subsoilinterestingly otus in the upper soil depth subsoil u showed a lower atom fraction excess on average when compared with the deeper subsoil l although the overall 13c content of the soil was not lower in the rhizosphere of subsoil u. in addition total carbon content increasedin the rhizosphere with soil depth data not shown.

subsoil horizons bt1 upper subsoil u 45-75 cm and bt2 lower subsoil l 75-105 cm are characterized by a high bulk density and clay accumulation silty clay loam with ph values of 6.9 total carbon and nitrogen decreased with depth.

whereas otus linked to pro- teobacteria were enriched in 13c mainly in the topsoil in both subsoil layers otus related to cohnella pae- nibacillus flavobacterium showed a clear 13c signal indicating an important so far overseen role of firmi- cutes and bacteriodetes in the subsoil rhizosphere.introductionthe microbiome of the rhizosphere has been considered as an important driver of functions contributing to plant health growth and yield berg et al.

as most microbes colonizing the rhizosphere are acquired from the soil microbiome we expect a dominance of firmicutes in the subsoil utilizing plant- derived carbon in the subsoil rhizosphere whereas in topsoil a dominance of proteobacteria occurs.results13c distribution pattern in the different soil and plant compartmentsat the end of the experimental period 90 days triticum aestivum formed a dense rooting network in all three ana- lyzed soil depths.

enrichment of 13c was highly pro- nounced for otus related to cohnella paenibacillus fla- vobacterium and chitinophagaceae in subsoil u and especially subsoil l. these otus also were of high rela- tive abundance compared to the topsoil.
