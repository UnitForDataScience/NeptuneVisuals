Host genetics may be a key factor in early coloniza- tion but while some studies have shown greater similarity in the microbiota of identical twins 14 than fraternal twins and siblings others have not 15.Transfer from Mother before and during BirthDuring birth the infant should be exposed to the moth- er's vaginal bacteria and the microbiota from the feces of the mother.

The nutri- tion and health status of the mother before during and after birth may be major factors in the early colonization of the infant.c 2017 S. Karger AG BaselIntroductionKnowledge of the bacteria in the human gut has in- creased substantially since the microbiome the collective genome of the gut microbiota has been elucidated and elaborated in different populations 1 2.

In addition the microbiome of the placenta amniotic fluid and breast milk alongside vaginal and fecal bacteria may aid the trans- fer of maternal bacteria to the infant.

Similar metabolic activities may be provided by different groups of bacteria and the exact species responsible for a particular function may not be as important as the metabolic capability of the consor- tium.

Despite evidence suggest- ing that a gut microbiome with lower numbers of bifi- dobacteria in infancy is related to later obesity 5 28 children with hyperphagic disorders 29 including Prader-Willi syndrome who developed obesity had more similar gut bacterial activity to normal obese chil- dren than those with the same condition but who had not become obese indicating that the bacterial differ- ences may have been caused by the obesity and not vice versa.ConclusionThe gut microbiome has been related to a range of dif- ferent acute and chronic diseases which stimulates con- sideration of strategies to modifyoptimize the bacterial profile and activities.

Understanding the fixed and modifiable factors that determine which bacteria are present and the resul- tant metabolic profile is the key to determining the role of the bacteria in promoting health or causing disease and should indicate possible interventions and treat- ments for combating a range of conditions.The gut microbiota is thought to be quite stable in adulthood 8 although more studies are needed to really establish this.
