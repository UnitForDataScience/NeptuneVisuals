Host genetics may be a key factor in early coloniza- tion but while some studies have shown greater similarity in the microbiota of identical twins 14 than fraternal twins and siblings others have not 15.Transfer from Mother before and during BirthDuring birth the infant should be exposed to the moth- er's vaginal bacteria and the microbiota from the feces of the mother.

The nutri- tion and health status of the mother before during and after birth may be major factors in the early colonization of the infant.c 2017 S. Karger AG BaselIntroductionKnowledge of the bacteria in the human gut has in- creased substantially since the microbiome the collective genome of the gut microbiota has been elucidated and elaborated in different populations 1 2.

Understanding the fixed and modifiable factors that determine which bacteria are present and the resul- tant metabolic profile is the key to determining the role of the bacteria in promoting health or causing disease and should indicate possible interventions and treat- ments for combating a range of conditions.The gut microbiota is thought to be quite stable in adulthood 8 although more studies are needed to really establish this.

In addition the microbiome of the placenta amniotic fluid and breast milk alongside vaginal and fecal bacteria may aid the trans- fer of maternal bacteria to the infant.

As tech- niques have improved and gene sequencing has made more detailed analysis of the microbiota and microbiome possible the factors that influence colonization have be- come more clearly established.

Despite evidence suggest- ing that a gut microbiome with lower numbers of bifi- dobacteria in infancy is related to later obesity 5 28 children with hyperphagic disorders 29 including Prader-Willi syndrome who developed obesity had more similar gut bacterial activity to normal obese chil- dren than those with the same condition but who had not become obese indicating that the bacterial differ- ences may have been caused by the obesity and not vice versa.ConclusionThe gut microbiome has been related to a range of dif- ferent acute and chronic diseases which stimulates con- sideration of strategies to modifyoptimize the bacterial profile and activities.

There are many barriers to new coloniza- tion by bacteria in the adult human including gastric acid bile acids pancreatic enzymes and most importantly the colonization resistance of the host microbiome.

The initial colonization and establishment of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract in early life is likely to be a major factor in determining the adult gut microbiome.

They found themilk of obese mothers had a less diverse microbiome than normal weight mothers and there was a major difference in the breast milk bacteria of mothers with normal deliv- ery and those undergoing elective cesarean but not emer- gency cesarean.

Manipulation of the microbiota may promote health.
