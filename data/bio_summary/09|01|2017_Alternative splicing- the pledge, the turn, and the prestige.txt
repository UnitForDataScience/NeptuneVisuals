Binding of specific splicing factors SF to intronic or exonic splicing enhancers ISE and ESE respectively promotes the inclusion of the alternative exon whereas binding of given splicing factors to intronic or exonic splicing silencers ISS and ESS respectively inhibits the splicing of the alternative exonFig.

In fact aberrant splicing itself has been proposed as a novel hallmark of cancer Ladomery .SRSF1 splicing factor and its associated kinase SRPK1 for instance have been implicated in the regulation of splicing events with prominent roles in several oncogenic signatures including the retention of intron 4 in the cyc- lin D1b splice variant that promotes cellular transformation Olshavsky et al.

TCGA data were also used in systematic pan-cancer analyses revealing a pool of splicing events commonly altered across different cancer types and splicing factors whose expression strongly associates to cancer-specific splicing signatures such as that of RBFOX2 QKI PTBP1 MBNL12 and CELF2Sebestyen et al.

.Given the large amount of information that TCGA and other sample collections provide involving several types of omics data and associated clinical features the chal- lenge now is integrating this knowledge to identify cancer- specific core regulatory mechanisms upstream of altered splicing networks and to characterise the functional signifi- cance and cause-effect relationship between cancer-specific changes in AS and oncogenesis.Splicing therapyThe previous sections of this review describe how misregu- lation of AS namely through perturbation of trans-acting factors that can trigger widespread splicing defects and or disruptions in cis that can alter splice sites and other splicing sequence regulatory elements can have an impact in human health Garcia-Blanco et al.

This testis-specific signature was observed in human chimpanzee and mouse and includes the organ-specific expression of several splicing regulators such as SF3A2 SRPK1 SRPK2 as well as core snRNP components.However a considerable number of splicing events in human testis are not conserved in other closely related organisms and many of them account for non-functional protein products by introducing premature stop codons in transcripts' sequences.

Based on these observations it has been proposed that part of the testis-specific splicing may represent background noise induced by high levels of cell proliferation decrease of quality control or unspecific fluc- tuations in the expression of splicing regulators Elliott and Grellscheid .

could bind to FGFR splice variants in the sperm acrosome to reg- ulate fertilisation-related events.A recent RNA-seq study evidenced a prominent repro- gramming of the splicing environment during male meiosis in mice identifying more than a hundred splicing switches including skipping of exon 2 in the ODF2Cenexin tran- script and mutually exclusive exons in the Ate1 gene Schmid et al.

Further studies are required not only to validate in humans the abundant evidence for AS modula- tion observed during mouse spermatogenesis but also tocomprehensively characterise the global splicing regulatory mechanisms governing human germ cell differentiation and reproduction.Alternative splicing in muscular tissuesThe functional unit of myofibrils in striated muscular tis- sues is the sarcomere Fig.

Bottom gradient panel shows the upregulation of the non-germ cell-specific splicing factors SPF27 RBM5 PTBP2 Tra2b CELF1 and CELF2 and the germ cell-spe- cific splicing factors Sam68 T-STAR hnRNPGT and RBMY.
