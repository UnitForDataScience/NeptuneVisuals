significant step- wise increase of clostrisium symbiosum was found in cra early crc and advanced crc p b 0.01. the combination of clostrisium symbiosum and fit achieved the highest performance auc  0.83 for development co- hort and 0.707 for validation cohort.

have done a very interesting research using a novel biomarker based on fecal clostrisium symbiosum to improve the detection of early and advanced colorectal cancer .

they measured clostrisium symbiosum by qpcr in 781 cases including 242 healthy controls 212 patients with colorectal adenoma cra 109 pa- tients with early crc 218 patients with advanced crc.

they concluded that fecal clostrisium symbiosum is a novel biomarker for early and non-invasive detection of colorectal neoplasia being more effective than reported markers such as fusobacterium nucleatum fit and cea.

combining the abundance of clostrisium symbiosum and fit may further improve the noninvasive diagnosis of early crc.in addition the cost of the screening test is an important factor to consider when it is used as a screening modality for population-based programmes.

while the commercial multitarget stool dna costs over us600 and may not be cost-effective for a screening setting   the addition of a single marker clostrisium symbiosum may substantially reduce the cost.

the most effective way to reduce mortality is to detect precancerous adenoma in an early stage.
