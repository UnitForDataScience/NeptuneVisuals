A reduction of HAM-A total score in anxious subjects in POSG or CTG and a significant reduction of positive subjects for HAM-A in POSG p 0 03 and in CDG p 0 01 were shown.

Several studies highlighted the role of microbiota in the regulation of mood and behavior like stress anxiety depres- sion and autism -as well as the potential therapeuticeffects deriving from its modulation.Due to the psychotropic effects in animal models and human clinical trials the term psychobiotics was intro- duced In fact it has been demonstrated that treatment with probiotics formulation containing Lactobacillus aci- dophilus Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium bifidum showed positive effects on psychological distress In vivo studies observed a relation between altered gut microbiota composition and anxiety related behavior with increased exploration of aversive zones and improved serotoninergic function in germ-free mice when compared to specific pathogen-free counterparts Moreover the anxiety-like behavior increases during pathogen infection and GI inflammation in animal models At the same time anxiety and other psychological disorders seem to be related to body composition and obesity Several studies observed learning memory and func- tion deficits in obese subjects linking obesity to the exacerba- tion of depression and anxiety disorders -Vice versa depression disorders have a strong positive association with eating behaviors and fat mass especially in subjects who do not follow a Mediterranean-like eating pattern Up today very few studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of psychobiotics on the health status of obese subjects.

POS was administrated 1 timeday 2 h before lunch in order to ensure gastrointesti- nal transit and absorption.Eligible patients were randomly divided into three groups 1  1  1 ratio 1 psychobiotics oral suspension group POSG subjects took daily note 1 bag of 3 g of POS and they did not change their ordinary diet 2 dietary treatment group DTG subjects followed a hypocaloric diet 3 combined treatment group CTG subjects followed the hypocaloric diet and took daily note 1 bag of 3 g of POS.
