So when the kernel matrix is directly available not computed from some dis- tance matrix we can substitute the centered kernel matrix as Gower matrix to calculate GRV in Section 3 we will see one such example.

For example when analyzing the association of host gene expression and microbiome profiles in 196 pre- pouch ileum PPI samples using KRV test see Section 3Q  trDT CT DT C  ijz2  0 which is closely relatedthe Gamma approximation gives a p-value of 6.5 x 10-5while the actual permutation p-value is 1.5 x 10-4 based onto the multi-trait variant set association test statisticPermutation P-Value CalculationThe distributions of GRV and KRV are generally unknown and permutations have been typically used to obtain their p-values Specifically their null distributions are obtained by randomly shuffling rows and columns of one kernel matrix simultaneously.

In light of their simple structure as a correlation and the common practice of compar- ing different methods based on the computed p-values we recommend that small Gamma approximation p-values should always be verified by the actual permutation p-values.On KRV5Supplementary MaterialsWeb appendices tables and figures referenced in Section 3.2 and an R package implementing the proposed method are available with this article at the Biometrics website on Wiley Online Library.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported in part by NIH grant GM083345 and CA134848.

In addition we analytically show that KRV can be written as a form of correlation coefficient which can dramatically expedite its computation and make permutation p-value calculation more efficient.Key words Gamma distribution Kurtosis Microbiome RV coefficient Skewness.Introduction proposed a kernel RV KRV coefficient to test the overall association between host gene expression and microbiome composition.
