At the lower taxonomic level the separation be- tween the yw and wild founders conditions was slightly less defined with yw parents flies samples being similar to the wild founders flies samples but statistically significantly different than the yw progeny food samples B.

Such factors include the experimental repeat replicate experiments A and B the nature of the samples fly samples and diet samples as well as the experimental level wild founders yw parents or yw progeny.

For subsequent experiments we therefore used a yeastsucrose diet containing a low dose 2.5 mlL as compared to4 mlL in our regular fly diet of propionic acid as preservative YSexp diet.Bacterial communities in the flies and in their diet are similarTo study the relationship between bacterial communities associated with flies and with their nutritive substrate we used the wild-derived Drosophila population described above as a natural microbiota pro- vider for a detailed description of the experimental protocol see Material and Methods Section 2.3.

All the yw conditions yw parents flies and yw progeny flies and food showed a statistically significantly decreased dissimilarity between samples compared to the wild founders conditions see table in A for p-values.

We therefore designed a diet deprived of Moldex and containing a reduced amount of propionic acid for our study in order to sustain diversity of the fly microbiota.As shown by the 16S-based profiling of their associated communitywhen kept in the laboratory on our diet designed to favor bacterial diversity YS- diet our wild-derived fly population indeed harbored a much more complex community than that of the yw stock even if the proportions were not strictly maintained almost all bacterial taxa present in the wild founder males were transferred to the diet and to the yw flies.

After 4 days fly and diet samples were retrieved from the cage and treated separately on one hand 4 replicate groups of 10 flies were crushed in 500 mL sterile PBS and on the other hand for each cage 3 replicates of 250 mg of microbes-seeded diet were crushed in 1 mL of sterile PBS.

In addition for both taxonomic levels the dissimilarity among the wild founders food samples was greater than those of wild founders flies samples.Discussion  conclusionsIn order to determine if our reference yellow white stock could serve as a microbiota-provider we first analyzed the composition of the bacterial community associated with this fly population and found it to be poorly diverse.

Since the Rhodospirillales and Enterobacteriales orders are re- presented each by a unique family in this study it is unsurprising thatthe predominant bacterial families in the yw progeny flies and diet samples were Acetobacteraceae and Enterobacteraceae D and E right panels.Although the three predominant orders remained the same namely Enterobacteriales Lactobacillales and Rhodospirillales the profile of the wild-derived bacterial community was slightly modified across samples through the experiment .

Given its lifestyle and transmission mode it is not sur- prising that Wolbachia is only found in the initial wild-derived fly samples and not in subsequent diet samples.
