Aspergillus complex sequences were isolated from fastq files using BLAST1with empirically defined pa- rameters E value  E-31 match length  95 based on both the ability of the A fumigatus ITS query to identify A fumigatus complex sequences in the large ITS database and comparison of resulting sequences isolated from the fastq files with A fumigatus complex ITS sequences from ITS databases and from the type sequences as previously defined.To reduce the possibility of misassignation from sequence error fastq files were first filtered using TrimmomaticSE to remove end sequences with Phred 33 scores 30 and any sequences containing 3 base windows with quality lower than Phred 30.

A fu- migatus complex  B forms the largest proportion of fungi in the disease groups.ITS1 is not useful for precise assignment of species within the A fumigatus complex and so assignation ofspecies in this clade is represented as A fumigatus species com- plex only.

Reverse BLAST1 analysis using formatted fastq files as databases confirmed species identification.Diverse A fumigatus complex sequences are observed in individual lungsTo further analyze the diversity of A fumigatus complex se- quences in our samples all A fumigatus sequences were extracted from the fastq files and filtered to remove sequences with Phred scores 30 to minimize any possibility that sequencing er- rors gave rise to sequence diversity.

Typical A fumigatus sensu stricto and A lentulus sequences were included in the analysis and are indicated in the figure.

Each tree shows a core set of A fumigatus sequences with 84 of 256 sequences for pa- tient 34 and 260 of 458 for patient 35 being identical to the A fumigatus sequence.

A significant difference between thera- peutic groups was observed for corticosteroid treatment  A and B.

This result mirrors that seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients based on sensitive culture techniques and high-dose ICS.Corticosteroids impair monocyte macro- phage and neutrophil phagocytosis of A fumigatus.If the un- proven assumption that the fungal load of A fumigatus reflects allergen load is true then this has important implications for man- agement of allergy in these individuals.

A secondary objective was to determine possible effects of treatment on the mycobiome.From athe Manchester Fungal Infection Group Division of Infection Immunity and Respiratory Medicine School of Biological Sciences University of Manchester bthe Manchester Academic Health Science Centre and cthe National Aspergillosis Centre Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust Wythenshawe dthe School of Biological Sciences Manchester Institute of Biotechnology University of Manchester and ethe School of Environment and Life Sciences University of Salford.Livingstone Chishimba PhD is currently at Cardiff and Vale University Hospitals Health Board Cardiff United Kingdom.M.B.

A common form of fungal disease is caused by allergic reactions to fungi that complicate existing respiratory pathology.

Aspergillus fumigatus causes life-threatening invasive aspergillosis chronic pulmonary aspergillosis Aspergillus-asso- ciated asthma and allergic diseases such as ABPA and SAFS.ABPA is characterized by exaggerated TH2 CD41 allergic inflammatory response to A fumigatus allergens including proteasesin the bronchial airway of atopic asthma and cystic fibrosis patients.
