il-17a neutralization was associated with a signifi- cant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-6 il- 1b and growth factors such as g-csf preventing develop- ment of lv dilation and lv dysfunction.therapeutic approaches targeting inflammation in chronic heart failurein recent years many approaches have been used for their ability to limit inflammation and thus minimize cardiac dam- age and prevent hf developmentenhancement of phagocytosis of dying cells efferocytosis inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines chemokines and inflammatory receptors   target general inflammation stimulating an endogenous anti-inflammatory state .however the most promising quickly emerging therapeu- tic strategies are stem cell-based therapies.clinical trials have targeted patients with primarily ische- mic cardiomyopathy icm and secondarily non-ischemic cardiomyopathy nicm using a variety of cellular sourcessuch as cd34 stem cells mscs and cardiac progenitor- derived cardiospheres .studies in mice showed how direct injection of cardiac progenitor cells into coronary arteries 30 days post mi at stage of chronic icm improved lv function and reduced cardiac fibrosis not only though increasing endothelial cells formation smaller scars and more viable myocardium but also by favoring an anti-inflammatory milieu changing the inflammatory state of macrophages within the myocardium .interestingly the mechanisms by which stem cells operate seem to have little to do with engraftment.

recent evidence demonstrates a prevalence of m1 macrophages in the culprit plaque for acs .large necrotic cores characterize plaques that cause acs plaque inflammation can promote necrotic core formation and on the other hand necrotic cores likely contribute to plaque rupture and acs as they possess inflammatory pro- teolytic and pro-thrombogenic properties .even resolution of inflammatory pathways is probably in- volved in acs pathogenesis includingpersistent influx and defective egress of myeloid cellssecondary necrosis of intimal cells because of defective efferocytosis augmenting necrotic core formationdegradation of the extracellular matrix and accumulation of damage associated molecular patterns damps which derive from necrotic cells and likely further ampli- fy plaque inflammation.neutrophils apoptosisin particular recent research demonstrates that damps trigger inflammatory pathways in macrophages by activating innate immune receptors including tlrs therefore contrib- uting to this vicious circle .considering the importance of inflammation and its reso- lution as determinants of acute coronary syndromes re- searchers largely tried to translate this knowledge into tools for clinical medicine.

hscrp was also found to reclassify risk of ischemic heart disease when added with parental story of vascular disease to the reynolds risk score  suggesting that hscrp might represent a better risk marker in subjects with hereditable risk-factors.inflammation and heart failurealthough the role of inflammation in acute coronary syn- dromes has received massive interest in cardiology a large amount of data also suggests that inflammation is a major component in the development and exacerbation of heart fail- ure hf in a symbiotic relationship fig.

although the mechanisms for the systemic inflammation is unknown en- dotoxins from inflammatory processes activation of toll like receptors and oxidative stress are imputed for the establish- ment and growth of inflammation and heart failure - which is probably more complex than a simple increase infig.

in atherosclerotic diseases .it is of interest indeed that these inflammation related similarities between atherosclerosis and other inflammation driven conditions have also led to a trial on the use offig.

further studies are needed to better clarify the issue and to define more targeted approaches to reduce pathological inflammation while preserving the physiological one.keywords acute coronary syndrome .

at the same time however another german pathologist rudolf wirchof hypothesized that atherosclerosis formation and complication was more complex than a simple build-up of waste product and that inflammation was one of the major components of the whole process.

reported that the risk of myocardial infarction was significantly raised in subjects with elevated markers of inflammation including lymphocytes neutrophils and acute reactants as crp and il-6.

in the last few years two important lines of research brought new and essential information to light in the field a the understanding of the immune mediate mech- anisms of inflammation in ihd and b evidence that the in- flammatory mechanisms associated with atherosclerosis and its complications can be modulated by anti-inflammatory mol- ecules.

while superficial erosion has a less clear relationship with inflammation the pathways by which in- flammation promotes fibrous cap rupture indisputably involve it.

moreover treg from unstable plaque shows a restricted tcr diversity suggesting an increased antigen-specific treg redistribution between the peripheral blood and local sites of inflammation .
