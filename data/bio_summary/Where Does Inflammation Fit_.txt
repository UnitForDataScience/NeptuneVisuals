hsCRP was also found to reclassify risk of ischemic heart disease when added with parental story of vascular disease to the Reynolds risk score  suggesting that hsCRP might represent a better risk marker in subjects with hereditable risk-factors.Inflammation and Heart FailureAlthough the role of inflammation in acute coronary syn- dromes has received massive interest in cardiology a large amount of data also suggests that inflammation is a major component in the development and exacerbation of heart fail- ure HF in a symbiotic relationship Fig.

After induction of EAM HMGB1 remained elevated 270 days post induction in animals and its blockade prevented EAM development .As for DAMPs pathogen-associated molecular patterns PAMPs can also promote activation of TLRs signaling de- termining transition from viral myocarditis to heart failure.As already discussed high doses of LPS induce production of several proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages through marked activation of TLR-4 nuclear factor kB and the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 NLRP3 inflammasome leading to ongoing inflammatory signaling and eventually to LV dysfunction -.Different macrophages lineage as protagonists of ongoing inflammation in heart failure and the contribution of NLRP-3 inflammasomeRecently distinct cardiac macrophage subsets were identi- fied which have their own separate origins and function .

in 2013 showed  inflammasome activa- tion dependent on the combination of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species production because of mitochon- drial dysfunction leading to increased susceptibility to ath- erosclerosis dyslipidemia hypertension and the prothrombotic state which ultimately can lead to heart failure development.Finally another contribution to the establishment of heart failure comes from the profibrotic pathways elicited by re- cruited cardiac macrophages which play a pivotal role in the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts through expression of transforming growth factor TGF-b  .

Also in this setting NLRP3 was found to represent a key element through regulation of mitochondrial ROS mROSproduction and Smad signaling ultimately leading to profibrotic gene expression .Role of adaptive immunity in heart failureThe role of adaptive immune system in heart failure devel- opment has been assessed in different contexts examining both immune-mediated and non-immune initial insult where activation of the immune system was a secondary response.Studies of transverse-aortic constriction TAC-mediated hypertension are documented in the recombination- activating gene RAG 2 knockout mouse model which lacks both B and T lymphocytes.

The trial is still ongoing but its results are expected soon and might if positive reinforce the inflamma- tory hypothesis and open new avenues to the treatment of ischemic heart disease.ConclusionsAlthough much progress has been made in the study of path- ophysiological mechanisms underlying the complex relation- ship between inflammation and acute coronary syndromes heart failure and cardiomyopathies much remains to be clarified.Historically anti-inflammatory therapies such as NSAIDs and TNFa inhibitors Infliximab and Etanercept were not ben- eficial in HF.

Gut micrombiomaIntroductionAccording to the theory of von Rokitansky ischemic heart disease and acute coronary syndromes were considered purely as the result of a chronic process of encrustation .

The PROVE-IT  trial demonstrated that patients with ischemic heart disease treated with aggressive statin ther- apy who achieved LDL levels 70 mgdL and hsCRP levels2 mgL had substantially lower rates of recurrent vascular events when compared with those who achieved only one or neither of these targets.

Although the inflammatory hypothesis is appealing and ap- pears reasonable in HF trials that addresses this hypothesis were largely negative.Recently several studies evaluating the role of Etanercept and Infliximab in chronic HF have assessed that an imbalance between pathological inflammatory pathways and tissue re- parative processes resulting in low-grade chronic inflamma- tion may be an important trigger of ongoing clinical deterio- ration in HF development  .Patients with chronic heart failure are characterized by sys- temic inflammation with rising levels of inflammatory cyto- kines according to the degree of HF severity.
