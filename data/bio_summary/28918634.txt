Very recently the ttrRS genes of Salmonella encoding the tetrathionate sensor and response regulator were chromosomally integrated into E. coli strain NGF-1 and served as a functional tetrathionate detection probiotic in a mouse model of inflammation for over 6 months.In light of these advances we developed an engineered strain of EcN harboring a plasmid-based system carrying mchAXIBCDEF and ttrRSBCA capable of producing MccH47 in response to environmental tetrathionate resulting in the ability to inhibit and out-compete Salmonella during in vitro experiments.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONConstruction and Analysis of a Plasmid-Based System for the Inducible Production of Microcin H47.

Both EcN pJPMcH47 A and E. coli NEB10b pJPMcH47  were capable of inhibiting both S. Typhimurium and E. coli DH5a.

enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 29630 purchased from ATCC Manassas VA. Plasmid constructs developed in this work were first transformed by electroporation into E. coli NEB10b cells and then to E. coli Nissle EcN.

Here we have developed a genetically engineered E. coli that produces a S. Typhimu- rium-inhibiting microcin in response to tetrathionate a molecule resulting from the inflammation of the intestine a hallmark of a Salmonella infection.Using in vitro assays we have shown that EcN pttrMcH47 not only preventsS.

For both strains we followed Lenski et al.and our previous work to determine relative fitness assuppress S. Typhimurium growth beyond what is obtained in direct competition experiments in an environment without the supplementation of tetrathionate C. The increased competitive advantage of EcN pttrMcH47 over S. Typhimurium in an environment supplemented with tetrathionate is particularly important considering recent work which has indicated that tetrathionate in the lumen of the inflamed gutprovides a growth advantage for S. Typhimurium over the restW  DPi  Piend - Pi0of the competing microbiota.iPi0Pi01Outlook.
