However the pro- apoptotic effects on cancer cells were abrogated with the inhibition of ETC complex II and III .In summary mutations of the mtDNA have been found to occur inhuman tumours at a high frequency and the nature of the mutations suggest reduced fidelity of mtDNA replication as a primary source of the mutations.

As a result cybrid cancer cells with mtDNA mutations have the potential of forming a tumor 7-fold larger than cybrid cancer cells with functional mtDNA .

Furthermore construction of a cybrid cell line of prostate cancer cells harboring specific mtDNA mutations has in nude mice been demonstrated to have a growth advantage over cybrids of prostate cells with functional mtDNA .

We will in this review correlate the contemporary knowledge on impact of bacterial regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and modulation of DNA repair and fidelity of the mitochondrial genome with risk factors identified for cancer.Bacterial infection induces mtDNA mutations and interferes with DNA damage responseBacteria of our microbiome as well as pathogenic bacteria can in- duce mitochondrial DNA mutations in our cells.

When affecting the nuclear DNA this greatly in- creases the risk of oncogenic gene mutations and cancer formation.Mutation of mtDNA in cancerMany cancer cells are highly glycolytic at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation.

In respect to the effect of bacteria on the fidelity of mtDNA the resulting mutations are analogous to the mutations seen with a high frequency in different tumours.

The gram positive pathogenic bac- terium E. faecalis does not have these virulence factors however infec- tion also induced transition mutations in the D-loop region of the gastric epithelial cells  and transition mutations have been shown to be the major mutational event found in mtDNA of human gastric carcinomas .

In a study on the occurrence of mtDNA mutations in human cancers somatic mtDNA mutations were demonstrated to occur frequently 13-63 in five different types of tumours.

The reviewed mutagenic effect of several bacteria on the mtDNA directly or indirectly through their inhibitory effects on the mitochondrial DNA repair proteins are therefore perfect analogues to the mtDNA mutations demonstrated to increase risk of carcinogenesis.

Here the compo- sition of the microbiome rather than one specific strain would be re- sponsible for the modulation of the cancer risk of the host.In addition to altering cancer risk bacteria targeting the mi-tochondria also have the potential to affect resistance of host cells to specific chemotherapeutics.
