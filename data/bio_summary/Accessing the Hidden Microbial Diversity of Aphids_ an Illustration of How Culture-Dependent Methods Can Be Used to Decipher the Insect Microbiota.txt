The identification at the genus level was determined based on sequencing the ITS region using universal primers for Ascomycota isolates and basidiomycete-specific primers for the Basidiomycota isolates Table S3.After identification the 68 bacterial isolates were assigned to 24 bacterial genera belonging to three different phyla i.e.

Total DNA of the isolated bacterial and fungal strains was extracted from biomass grown at 20 degC for 2 to 5 days on 868 agar plates.Identification of IsolatesIn order to identify the isolates and to discriminate between similar isolates a multilocus gene sequencing approach was attempted consisting in amplifying and sequencing fragments of the 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gyrB and recA genes for the bacterial isolates and the nearly complete 18S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer ITS region for the fungal isolates.

The identification of our isolates was carried out at the genus level.Diagnostic PCRFor the isolates identified as potentially Staphylococcus saprophyticus or Staphylococcus xylosus based on the 16S rRNA sequencing a diagnostic PCR was performed in order to discriminate between the two species.

The drop of medium containing aphid hemolymph or crushed aphid extract was then plated on 868 medium agar plates the same as the 863 medium but additionally having 17 g of agar per L. The second method consisted in aseptically placing a few disinfected aphid individuals in an Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of 863 medium and crushing the aphids with a small pestle.

The obtained PCR products were further purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Kit GE Healthcare Buckinghamshire UK according to the manufacturer's indications and sequenced at the GIGA Center at the University of Liege using the Big Dye v3.1 Kitand an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer Applied BiosystemsLife Technologies Carlsbad CA USA.For all bacterial isolates the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified using the universal primers 16SP0 and 16SP6.

The same PCR primers were then used for sequencing the amplified fragments.For all fungal isolates the nearly complete 18S rRNA gene was amplified with primers PriA and PriB and using the same PCR program as for the 16S rRNA amplification except that 30 PCR cycles were performed instead of 26.

The PCR products were resolved by elec- trophoresis on 1 wv agarose gels stained with 1 mgmL ethidium bromide.Phylogenetic TreesThe 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequeences obtained here for the bacterial and fungal isolates were optimally aligned with DNAMAN version 7 Lynnon Corp. Quebec Canada using ClustalW .

The isolates AnA5.1 and AnA8.1 could be closely related strains of Pantoea sp.

The Firmicutes isolates also included two- core genera that were isolated from both wild and laboratory-reared aphids i.e.

The fungal isolates obtained in this study have not been previously reported in aphids and are not phylogenetically related to the yeast-like symbiont described for the aphid Hamiltonaphis styraci Fig.
