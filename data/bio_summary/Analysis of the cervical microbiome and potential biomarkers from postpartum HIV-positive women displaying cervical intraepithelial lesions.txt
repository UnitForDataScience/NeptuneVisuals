A longitudinal study of woman followed-up during pregnancy and postpartum showed that the cervicovaginal microbiota composition is modi- fied at six weeks postpartum with increased bacterial diversity and decrease in L. crispatus moieties.Based on this information we hypothesize that postpartum HIV-positive women have a highly diverse cervi- covaginal microbiota which could be associated with an increased risk for developing persistent HPV infection and consequently CIN.

In a longitudinal study with samples collected over a 16-week period women with highly diverse or L. iners-dominated cervicovaginal microbiota were more likely to be HPV-positive while a microbiota dominated by L. gasseri was associated with more rapid clearance of HPV infection.The high diversity of cervicovaginal microbiota is strongly correlated with local inflammation and it is also thought to increase the risk for HIV acquisition.

Addionally our results are consistent with a study that analyzed the microbiota from an HIV-negative women cohort with normal cytology which showed a persistent and highly diverse microbiota in the postpartum period of samples collected for up to one year after delivery.

Soares 1The cervical microbiota composition and diversity of HIV-positive women in the postpartum period is unknown.

However the profile of such microbiota in HIV-infected women in the postpartum period remained largely unknown.In this study we identified four CSTs in postpartum HIV-positive women which for the sake of definition in previous reports have been named CSTs III IV-A IV-B.1 and IV-B.2.

The relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa was compared in groups of paired samples that maintained the lesion status normal or lesion in both samples or changed the status between samples normal at 6 months and lesion at 12 months and vice-versa with the Wilcoxon test in SPSS.Data availability.

In the current study we report the first data on the cervical microbiota of HIV-positive women in the postpartum period.
