Although the data is weak and contradictory reduction of the acid barrier function as suspected for atrophic gastritis34 use of proton pump inhibitors5 and gastrectomy67 is thought to lead to higher microbial loads in the small intestine.Impaired intestinal clearanceAlthough several reviews highlight anatomic patho logies associated with small intestinal obstruction and stagnation for example strictures adhesions tumours of the small bowel duodenal and jejunal diverticula previous abdominal surgery such as blind loop syndrome after BillrothII or RouxenY procedure or bariatric bypass surgery to be associated with SIBO only very few or no data at all support these hypotheses.

Otherwise little is known about the effect of drugs used to deteriorate intestinal motility even though narcotics have been identified as contributing to wards SIBO16.Impairment of immunological mechanisms Data about the role of the immune system are alsoSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO is defined as an increase in the number of bacteria in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

A simplified model which included a leading factor of each pathophysiological pathway revealed that in ascending order impaired immune response impaired intestinal clearance and hypothyroidism are the key pathways for the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.Hypo-achlorhydriaBoth PPI therapy and even more predominantly gastrectomy were significantly associated with SIBO Table 2.

However both variables are of minor relevance and lost their significance in multivariate models.Impaired intestinal clearanceAnatomic modifications which might lead to im pairment of intestinal clearance derive mostly from surgery but similar to a smaller retrospective study by Petrone et al8 overall abdominal surgery was not associated with an increased risk of SIBO neither were sigmoid nor ileocecal resection nor obstetric surgery Table 3.

Since blind loops of any reason were astonishingly not associated to SIBO the combination of intestinal diversion and loss of acid barrier is of greater relevance.Since small intestinal motility is difficult to quantify as a promoter of clearance this effect might be estimated by measuring gastroparesis as a surrogate parameter.

Suspected contributors were su- mmarised under four different pathophysiological path- ways impaired gastric acid barrier impaired intestinal clearance immunosuppression and miscellaneous factors including thyroid gland variables and investi- gated using the kh 2 test Student's t -test and logistic regression models.RESULTSA total of 1809 patients who had undergone hydrogen breath testing were analysed.
