However NDFD by fungi tended to decrease in diet contain- ing SLM 144 h after incubation might be due to increase of rhizoid growing which lead to break the physical structure ofTable 5Effect of replacement of alfalfa hay with SLM on in vitro rumen fermentation parameters by rumen bacteria of Najdi goatsTable 6Effect of replacement of alfalfa hay with SLM on in vitro rumen fermentation parameters by mixed rumen fungi of Najdi goatsMeans within a row with different letters are different P  0.05SLM subabul leaf meal SEM standard error of the mean b gas production from the fermentable fraction c gas production rate constant PF partitioning factor MP microbial protein production EMBP efficiency microbial biomass production OMTD organic matter truly digested ADS apparent degraded substrate SEM standard error of the meana Diets containing alfalfa hay as control group and alfalfa hay replacing SLM at 50 levelMeans within a row with different letters are different P  0.05SLM subabul leaf meal SEM standard error of the mean b gas production from the fermentable fraction c gas production rate constant PF partitioning factor MP microbial protein production EMBP efficiency microbial biomass production OMTD organic matter truly digested ADS apparent degraded substrate SEM standard error of the meana Diets containing alfalfa hay as control group and alfalfa hay replacing SLM at 50 levelTable 7Total protozoa population in goats fed experimental dietsDietsaThe antiprotozoal effect of SLM was most likely due to presence of secondary compounds such as tannins and mimosine.

Significance was declared at P  0.05 and trends at P  0.10 and P  0.05 using Tukey's multiple comparison test.ResultsAs shown in Table  DMD was unaffected by replaced alfalfa hay with SLM for both rumen bacteria and fungi in specific culture medium for different incubation times except for 48 h of incubation in specific culture medium of mixed rumen bac- teria which decreased for SLM group compared to the control diet P  0.05.Effect of replacement of alfalfa hay with SLM on NDFD and ADFD by rumen bacteria and fungi are presented in Table .

Experimental treatments included alfalfa hay as control group and diet con- taining SLM SLM replacing alfalfa hay at 50 level.

Experimental treatments were included alfalfa hay as control group and diet containing SLM alfalfa hay replaced SLM at 50 level.Sampling and chemical analysisFresh leaf materials leaves with petioles were harvested from subabul trees in Khuzestan province which is located south- west of Iran during summer season.

Dry matter disappearance DMD was unaffected by replacing SLM with alfalfa hay for both rumen bacteria and fungi in different incubation times except for 48 h of incubation in specific culture medium of mixed rumen bacteria which de- creased for SLM group P  0.05.

Results indicated that PF MP EMBP and OMTD were de- creased with replacing SLM by alfalfa hay in specific culture medium of mixed rumen fungi may have been due to mimosine content of SLM.
