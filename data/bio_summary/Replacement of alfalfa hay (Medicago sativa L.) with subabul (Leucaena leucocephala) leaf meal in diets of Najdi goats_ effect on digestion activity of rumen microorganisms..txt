however little information is avail- able in the literature regarding the effects of replacement al- falfa hay with slm on the rumen microorganism activity.

hence this experiment was conducted to assess the effects of replacement of alfalfa hay with slm in diets of najdi goats on digestion activity of rumen microorganisms.materials and methodsanimal careall animal management and sampling procedures conducted according to the care and use of agricultural animals in research and teaching fass  guidelines.
