In recent years a huge number of studies have revealed the critical roles of gut microbiota in the development of metabolic diseases including type 1 and 2 diabetes  obesity - cardiovascular disease - and chronic liverdiseases .Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is a spectrum of chronic liver diseases including simple steatosis nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH fibrosis cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma HCC .

The gut microbiota is also involved in choline metabolism by converting it into toxic dimethylamine and trimethylamine which are transported to liver and converted into trimethylamine oxide TMAO that causes liver inflammation and damage .

Nevertheless the changes in gut microbiota resulting from antibiotics could provide important evidence for exploring alternative ways to modulate gut microbiota in disease therapy.Compared to antibiotics some ingredients from herbal medicines have shown more prospects for gut microbiota modulation with minor side effects .
