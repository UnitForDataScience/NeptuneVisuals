Three to seven OTUs were detected for each archaeal amoA gene clone library whereas the number of detected OTUs for the bacterial amoA gene clone library ranged from three to nine Table For the archaeal amoA gene clone libraries rhizosphere sediment sample of P. communis had remarkably lower diversity than those of the unvegetated sediments and the rhizosphere sediment samples of Z. caduciflora.FIGURE 1 The numbers of archaeal black columns and bacterial gray columns amoA gene copies in rhizosphere sediments of two different emergent macrophytes PCRS ZCRS and the bulk sediments BS.

In this study higher PNRs were found in the rizhosphere sediments of both emergent macrophytes Table and were positively correlated with the abundance of bacterial but not archaeal amoA gene Table These results suggested thatTABLE 3 Pearson correlation coefficients between environmental parameters and the abundance or the numbers of detected OTUs of the archaeal and bacterial amoA geneCN ratio carbon nitrogen ratio TP total phosphorus NO3-N nitrate nitrogen NH4-N ammonia nitrogen PNR potential nitrification rates.p  0.05 p  0.01.FIGURE 2 Phylogenetic affiliations of the archaeal a and bacterialb amoA gene sequences obtained from the rhizosphere sediment samples of the two emergent macrophytes P. communis Z. caduciflora and bulk sediments.

Relationships between abundance and diversity of the archaeal and bacterial amoA genes and environmental parametersThe abundance of the archaeal amoA gene was negatively correlated with pH p  0.05 Table whereas the abundance of bacterial amoA gene was positively correlated with pH p  0.05.

Moreover the positive relationship between the bacterial amoA gene abundance and the pH found in the present study was consistent with previous results found inthe soil ecosystem The concentrations of NH -N were correlated with the abundance of the bacterial amoA gene r  0.759 p  0.01 which was also consistent with previous studies In the present study more than half 69.77 of the obtained archaeal amoA gene sequences were affiliated with the Nitrosotalea cluster.

A series of 110 dilutions ranging from 2.07 x 102 to 2.07 x 107 per microliter of the archaeal amoA gene copies and 1.45 x 102 to 1.45 x 107 per microliter of the bacterial amoA gene copies were used to generate standard curves for quantifying the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes.

Sequence that were affiliated with the Nitrosospira group were not found in the rhizosphere sediments of Z. caduciflora.TABLE 2 Diversity of the archaeal and bacterial amoA gene clone libraries derived from different sediment samplesArchaeal amoA geneBacterial amoA genePCRS rhizosphere sediments of P. communis ZCRS rhizosphere sediments of Z. caduciflora BS bulk sediment.

The archaeal amoA gene was found in remarkably higher abundance than the bacterial amoA gene in bulk sediments and the P. communis rhizosphere sediments.

showed that the abundance of the archaeal amoA gene was significantlyhigher than that of bacterial amoA gene in the rhizosphere sediments of submerged macrophytes of Lake Taihu.

The results demonstrated that the emergent macrophytes maintained remarkable effects on the abundance and community composition of the ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms that were associated with their rhizosphere sediments.Both the archaeal and bacterial amoA genes were detected in large amounts in the rhizosphere and bulk sediment samples.

They found an increased abundance of bacterial but not archaeal amoA gene in the rhizosphere sediments of submerged macrophytes.
