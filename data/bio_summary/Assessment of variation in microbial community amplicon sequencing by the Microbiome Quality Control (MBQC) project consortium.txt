Omnibus tests for differences among specimen type handling laboratory and bioinformatics laboratory are all significant at Kruskal-Wallis P  0.05 pairwise Wilcoxon tests for the effects of most individual handling laboratories are significant while those of most bioinformatics laboratories are not Supplementary Table 6.showing little effect and others differing substantially primarily based on this single handling protocol variable Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig.

samples from identical specimens within each laboratory without varying any parameters to identify which laboratories were most internally consistent  2 beta-diversity comparisons of replicate samples between laboratories varying only the bioinformatics  or handling laboratory to identify which laboratories agreed with each specimen type's consensus readout  3 alpha-diversity of all stratified samples within laboratory to identify which performed more complete extractions inducing higher diversity or inflated positive-control diversity inducing lower diversity and 4 beta-diversity across all samples varying only one parameter at a time bioinformatics laboratory extracter sequencer or specimen .

OTU QC most often included feature or row QC that is removal of OTUs below an abundance or prevalence threshold some laboratories also performed sample or column QC to omit samples with too few reads Supplementary Note 2.Taxonomic profilesThe combination of read-level QC and OTU assignment yielded an average of 40 M reads per sample handling laboratory and 35000 - 43700 readssample for a total of 15749 filtered samples each sam- ple being a unique combination of aliquot handling laboratory and bioinformatics laboratory Supplementary Table 4.

All aliquots in the set were assigned blinded identifiers before distribution such that handling laboratories received no information linking aliquots either to replicates or to specimens of origin.Sample handling and bioinformatics protocolsFrom these aliquots handling laboratories generated a total of 215 M sequence reads spanning 2250 samples aliquot-laboratory combina- tions Supplementary Data set 5.

Labels indicate stratification by sample handling laboratory a specimen type b bioinformatics laboratory c or subject d. Major contributors to between-sample diversity thus include biological origin handling protocol differences and bioinformatics protocol variables Supplementary Fig.

All parameters were tested using a likelihood ratio test with Benjamini- Hochberg-Yekutieli FDR correction across all outcomes.top 100 IDs genus Pseudomonas 7 and family Enterobacteriaceae 6 Supplementary Note 6.Multivariate quantification of variationAs a final joint quantification of the multiple aspects of variance among both sample handling and bioinformatics protocols we fit two mixed effects models to the transformed abundances of the four major gut phyla Actinobacteria Bacteroides Firmicutes and Proteobacteria Supplementary Table 8 Supplementary Fig.

Finally one laboratory deposited data after data sets were redistributed yield- ing a total of 14 handling laboratories' data which were distributed for bioinformatic analyses all raw data are available at the DACC.Each sample-handling laboratory deposited demultiplexed FASTQ files containing the resulting data at the DACC which were then re- blinded for distribution to bioinformatics participants.

ab Significant fixed a and random effects b on phylum-level variation in taxonomic abundance derived from a simplified model of handling and bioinformatics laboratory variables for which there were sufficientdata available for evaluation Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig.

Although factors such as PCR re-extraction and database representation 16S versus whole genome all prevent perfect correlations between amplicon and metagenomic data this experiment supported the expected ground truth and further confirmed the variability of laboratory and bioinformatics protocols when reading out even these low-complexity communities.Finally raw reads deposited by each handling laboratory before any bioinformatics were analyzed to assess the potential causes of artifacts Supplementary Fig.

For example when comparing bioinformatics laboratories each boxplot summarizes the set of beta diversities between each specimen's replicate samples as analyzed by one laboratory and the same specimen's replicates as analyzed by all other laboratories.
