However the influence of SNPs in microRNA-binding sites of the IL13 gene on the risk of colorectal cancer and overall survival has not been reported.In this study we explored the association of dietary factors and polymorphisms in the microRNA-binding site of IL13 with the risk and prognosis of CRC with the aim of providing meaningful instructions on dietary intake for individuals with specific genetic variants of IL13.RESULTSIn Supplementary Table 1 we present all the SNPs with minor allele frequency MAF  5 located at the miRNA binding sites of genes involved in inflammatory processes.

The lack of association between IL13 polymorphisms and overall survival or clinical pathological characteristics is unsurprising given that the altered gut microbiota caused by dietary factors and genetic variants in IL13 may play a lead role in carcinogenesis rather than prognosis of CRC.Several studies have reported the influence of SNPs in IL13 on the risk of cancer and a meta-analysis concluded that IL13 rs20541 polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility to cancer 19.

SNP Single Nucleotide PolymorphismORdg OR for combined effects of dietary factors and genetic factors ORi OR for interactive effects of dietary factors and genetic factorsstudies have suggested that dietary habits play a key role in modulation of the gut microbiota composition 31 32.

Although our study has a relatively large sample size the number of individuals in some subgroups with variant homozygotes is still too small to obtain sufficient statistical power.In summary this is the first study using population epidemiological methods to elucidate the role of gut microbiota-related dietary factors and polymorphisms in miRNA-binding site in IL13 in CRC.

However we did not find any significant association of these three SNPs with the risk of colorectal cancer.With respect to the functional capacity of adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbes dietary factors and chronic inflammatory factors have been recognized as crucial causes of CRC 27-30.

This study examines the association of gut microbiota-related dietary factors and polymorphisms in the microRNA-binding site of the interleukin 13 gene IL13 with the risk and prognosis of CRC.

A key novel finding of this study was evidence for combined and interactive effects of SNPs in IL13 and dietary factors in CRC development.

This is the first report of significant combined and interactive effects between dietary factors and polymorphisms in the microRNA binding site of IL13 in CRC and may provide direct guidance on intake of allium vegetable and overnight meals for individuals with specific genetic variants of IL13 to modify their susceptibility to CRC.INTRODUCTIONColorectal cancer CRC is a major public health problem worldwide 1.

As dietary factors influence the structure and activity of the microorganisms residing in the human gut inter-individual differences in colorectal cancer susceptibility may be mediated by the mutual influence of inflammatory gene expression and dysbiosis of gut microbiota.

Based on the results of our study intake frequency of more than 7 timesweek for garlic or other allium vegetable is not recommended.A recent study demonstrated that bacterial diversity is remarkably decreased in the gut microbiota of mice models of sporadic colorectal cancer and colitis-associated cancer 42.
