Indeed recent studies indicate that the gut microbiota is closely associated with the pathogenesis of acute GVHD In this review we discuss the role of the gut microbiota in acute GVHD and its potential use for treatment of acute GVHD.Gut microbiota and the development of acute GVHDAn association between the gut microbiota and the develop- ment of acute GVHD has long been suspected.

In the 1970s the use of murine allo-SCT models demonstrated that germ-free bacteria- free mice develop less severe acute GVHD than conventional mice and that eradication of the gut microbiota prevents the devel- opment of acute GVHD Then several clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the prophylactic effect of the eradication of gut microbiota with oral non-absorbable antibiotics gut decon- tamination against acute GVHD but a clear benefit has not been demonstrated However a more recent retrospective study showed that pediatric patients with successful total gut decontam- ination had a significantly lower rate of acute GVHD although the overall incidence of acute GVHD was very low 8 In this study total gut decontamination was considered successful when stool cultures were negative for both fungi and bacteria in at least three of five samples obtained from day 10 to day 30 In a mouse model loss of bacterial diversity is observed in GVHD mice after SCT On development of GVHD mice treated with ampicillin before SCT day 21 to 14 show a loss of Blautia and emergence of Enterococcus.

Importantly most of these studiesGastrointestinal GVHDThe incidence of chronic GVHD was not significantly different between the two groups.evaluated the entire spectrum of acute GVHD not only gut GVHD and thus indicate that the gut microbiota may modulate systemic allo-immune responses.Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota also play a cru- cial role in the control of the intestinal immune system Short chain fatty acids are among the most studied metabolites and are produced as fermentation products from digestion-resistant oligosaccharides and fiber by the gut microbiota in the colon Short chain fatty acids refer to free fatty acids containing fewer than six carbons formic acid C1 acetic acid C2 propionic acid C3 butyric acid C4 and valeric acid C5.

No probiotic-related infections were observed although the impact of this synbiotic combination of pro- and prebiotics therapy on acute GVHD was not evaluated in this study These results indicate that probiotics may be safely used in peritransplant period.Our group conducted a pilot study of fecal microbiota transplan-tation FMT for steroid-refractorydependent acute GVHD of the gut FMT refers to infusion of a fecal suspension from a healthy donor into the GI tract of a patient to restore a healthy microbiota and cure disease.

Rifaximin a rifamycin derivative with broad spectrum activity and negligible intestinal resorp- tion preserves the structure of the colonic microbiota and exerts anti-inflammatory activities In allo-SCT gut decontamination with rifaximin was associated with lower TRM better OS lower incidence of gut GVHD and lower GVHD-related mortality com- pared with decontamination using ciprofloxacinmetronidazole Furthermore gut colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with a higher incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and gut GVHD Thus antibiotic selection may be another strategy for the control of acute GVHD.Foods are another important factor affecting the gut micro-biota.
