indeed recent studies indicate that the gut microbiota is closely associated with the pathogenesis of acute gvhd in this review we discuss the role of the gut microbiota in acute gvhd and its potential use for treatment of acute gvhd.gut microbiota and the development of acute gvhdan association between the gut microbiota and the develop- ment of acute gvhd has long been suspected.

in the 1970s the use of murine allo-sct models demonstrated that germ-free bacteria- free mice develop less severe acute gvhd than conventional mice and that eradication of the gut microbiota prevents the devel- opment of acute gvhd then several clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the prophylactic effect of the eradication of gut microbiota with oral non-absorbable antibiotics gut decon- tamination against acute gvhd but a clear benefit has not been demonstrated however a more recent retrospective study showed that pediatric patients with successful total gut decontam- ination had a significantly lower rate of acute gvhd although the overall incidence of acute gvhd was very low 8 in this study total gut decontamination was considered successful when stool cultures were negative for both fungi and bacteria in at least three of five samples obtained from day 10 to day 30 in a mouse model loss of bacterial diversity is observed in gvhd mice after sct on development of gvhd mice treated with ampicillin before sct day 21 to 14 show a loss of blautia and emergence of enterococcus.

no probiotic-related infections were observed although the impact of this synbiotic combination of pro- and prebiotics therapy on acute gvhd was not evaluated in this study these results indicate that probiotics may be safely used in peritransplant period.our group conducted a pilot study of fecal microbiota transplan-tation fmt for steroid-refractorydependent acute gvhd of the gut fmt refers to infusion of a fecal suspension from a healthy donor into the gi tract of a patient to restore a healthy microbiota and cure disease.

furthermore intervention in the gut microbiota with a nutritional approach including prebiotics postbiotics and antibiotics selection may also be another promising treatment option for acute gvhd.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.contentsintroductionalthough allogeneic stem cell transplantation allo-sct is a potentially curative treatment for various hematological diseases acute graft-versus-host disease gvhd is a major cause of mor- bidity and mortality acute gvhd is driven by activated donor t cells that attack host tissues and primarily affects three organs the skin the gastrointestinal gi tract and the liver causing rash diarrhea and jaundice respectively.

evaluations of therapies targeting the gut microbiota such as probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation have just begun.

also in allo-sct both preclinical and clinical results indicate that the gut microbiota is closely associated with the development of acute gvhd and transplant outcomes.

these results led to the idea that improvement in quantitative andor qualitative abnormalities of microbiota dysbiosis may be a new treatment strategy for acute gvhd.

indeed although not statistically sig- nificant bacterial translocation is suppressed in mice treated with lgg or antibiotics compared to control mice in recent years the association between the gut microbiota and acute gvhd andor transplant outcomes has also been evaluated in humans similar to the mouse model loss of intesti- nal diversity is observed in patients with gvhd.

strategies targeting the gut microbiota including pro- pre- postbiotics antibiotic selection nutrition and a combination of these strategies could be a new treatment tool for acute gvhd.
