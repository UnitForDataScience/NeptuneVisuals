The distinctive capability to endure the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract owing to the presence of bile salts in gastric juice facilitates gut microbiota especially the probiotic organisms to transiently inhabit the host gut.

The functions of down-reg- ulated proteins were largely unknown nevertheless the putative functions of the up-regulated proteins were categorized into categories viz.

The positive effects of lactobacilli on individual health are recognized to be strain-specific but the mecha- nisms of strain-dependent factors are not well-understood.In the present study shotgun label-free quantification LFQ ap- proach coupled with liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spec- trometry LC-MSMS was used to enabling precise quantification 1874-3919c 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.with greater efficiency and accuracy.

The gel-based techniques in com- parison with LFQ are laborious lengthy and demand more replicates for understanding inter-gel variations.

The LFQ technique is preferred for protein quantifica- tion compared to 2D-DIGE because it has relatively better accuracy and is able to do away with high sample requirements of gel based tech- niques.

The strain of NCDC 400 was originally isolated from fermented milk product curd.

On reaching the appropriate density cells were harvested 8000 g 15 min 4 degC and resuspended in prewarmed MRS broth with or without bile salts 1.2 wv and again incubated at 37 degC for 2 h. The cultures were then harvested 8000 g 15 min 4 degC and washed twice with sterile saline 0.85 wv NaCl prepared with double distilled water.

The samples were then lysed through resuspending in 500 ml of lysis buffer I 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.8 0.3 SDS 200 mM DTT 1 mM PMSF1 mM EDTA containing a bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail Sigma- Aldrich.

The supernatant was used to precipitate the proteins by adding 10 volumes of cold acetone and overnight incubation at -20 degC.

The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 20000g for 10 min.
