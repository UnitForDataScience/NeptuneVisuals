We have come a long way in under- standing and managing infection in surgical patients since Listerian times and most patients undergo surgery without the complication of SSI.

DOI 10.1002bjs.10468BJS is dedicating a special issue to surgical infection because infections in surgical patients are common debilitating and costly.

There is therefore a prescient need to discuss and develop alternative strategies to mitigate infection risk and develop appropriate robust antimicrobial stew- ardship in patients undergoing and recovering from surgery.

Established treatment strategies such as preoperative skin preparation are re-evaluated and novel ones such as vaccination prophylaxis against wound infection explored.Infection in surgical patients may be split into two types that relatedto the surgical site or the wound and that which occurs at a remote site following the surgical procedure.

Other infections occur in surgical patients including those related to indwelling catheters uri- nary and respiratory infections.

The Sepsis Six is now familiar to many surgeons as the name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis.

These patients are also at high risk of SSI.

However the optimal management of these patients is still debated.

However non- elective surgery procedures are associated with a higher risk of SSI and many of these patients will have wounds that are difficult to close primarily or are contaminated.
