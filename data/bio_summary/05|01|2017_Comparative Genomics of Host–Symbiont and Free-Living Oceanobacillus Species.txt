human ethical guide- lines were followed strictly before engaging the volunteer for this study with ethical clearance from the human ethical committee of m. d. university rohtak haryana india.

however there were two major branches in the tree  one primarily containing organisms isolated from human gut three out of four and the other with two sub branches segregating into environmental and human gut isolates.

at the same time cog u intracellular trafficking secretion andvesicular transport cog o posttranslational modification protein turnover chaperones cog l replication recombina- tion and repair appeared to be over represented in the core genome of the human symbiont group .further we queried for functions selectively present in the human symbiont and free-living subgroups.

in this study we sequence and assemble the genome of oceanobacillus faecalis strain hm6 a resident of the human gut.

using the genus oceanobacillus and the hm6 draft genome sequence we explore the functional requirements for survival in a symbiotic arrangement within the human gut in contrast to free living in the environment.

recent reports highlight that the human gut microbiota has codi- versified with the host   suggest- ing resident bacterial species to have acquired functions in their genomes which assist in colonizing.

as we move into the translational era of genomic sciences the microbial com- munity and its members are expected to be used for diag- nosis and treatment  .in this regard it is important to understand the genomic suitability for a symbiont.species of the genus oceanobacillus are known to inhabit the human gut   however multiple other species of the same genus have been described as free-living organisms      .

in this study we report the complete genome sequence of a human symbiont oceanobacillus faecalis strain hm6.

1.--maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showing relation among human symbiont red and free living blue species of the genusoceanobacillus.comparative genomics pan- core- and accessory- genomepan genome of the oceanobacillus genus was constructed by clustering protein sequences from an aggregated pool of pro- tein sequences from all strains.

the ppm was used to obtain pan core and accessory genomes of the entire oceanobacillus genus as well as of human symbiont and environmental species.resultsphysiological and taxonomic summary of o. faecalis strain hm6bacterial cells were gram-negative rod shaped aerobic and nonspore forming.

phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna of the isolated human gut microbe with its homologs verified its phylogeny of oceanobacillus.

species names are colored with respect to human symbionts red or environmental free living blue.
