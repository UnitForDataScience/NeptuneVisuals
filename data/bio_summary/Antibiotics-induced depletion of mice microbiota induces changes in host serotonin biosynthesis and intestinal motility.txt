But few systematical studies focus on the relationship among BAs 5-HT microbiota and gut motility.Germ-free mice model has been used in several stud- ies which were interested in the relationship between gut microbiota and motility.

d.Gut microbiota regulate contractility of proximal colonic muscleAs antibiotics-treated mice had a decreased fecal out- put and delayed intestinal transit it raised the possibility that commensal microbiota might affect the spontaneous contraction of intestinal smooth muscle.

For example stool consistency was suggested to be negatively correlated with species rich- ness of gut microbiota in humans which indicated that the fecal parameter such as water content was affected not only by gut motility but also by gut microbiota rich- ness .

Studies have focused on the role of gut micro- biota on host physiology which show the microbiota affect gut motility tissue regeneration in particular of the villi gut-associated lymphoid tissue GALT matu- ration and intestinal barrier function .

Alterations in the composition of gut microbiota may lead to dysfunc- tion of motility which might be one of the pathogenic factors in slow transit constipation STC  .The germ-free animals are used in many studies to show the influence of gut microflora on gut motor func- tion.

The antibiotics- treated method has been used to prove the reversibility of microbial effects on host 5-HT and gut motility .The present study was designed to evaluate whether depletion of gut microbiota by antibiotics could influencegut motility and whether this effect was mediated by reg- ulating host serotonin metabolism.MethodsAnimals and antibiotics treatment protocolAll procedures were conducted according to Model Animal Research Center and were approved by the Experimentation Ethics Review Committee of Nanjing University.

Taxonomically after antibiotics treatments the abundance of intestinal microbiota decreased significantly in all levels as shown in Fig.

At phylum level only Proteobacteria accounted for more than 0.5 of all the microbiota in mice treatedwith antibiotics.

In addition the species richness Chao decreased from 354.3 - 42.9 to 98.3 - 15.1 P  0.01 and a diversity Shannon decreased from 4.0 - 0.4 to 0.5 - 0.1 P  0.01.Depletion of gut microbiota affects fecal parameter and weight of cecumAfter 4 weeks with antibiotics treatments mice had a significant tendency toward decreased in weight when compared to control every week Fig.
