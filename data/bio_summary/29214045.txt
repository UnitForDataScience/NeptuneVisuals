The active sites within positive ORFs were predicted using AMPAand make up the peptides included in the peptide library to be screened for antimicrobial activity.Peptide synthesis and antimicrobial screeningThe peptides in the created peptide library were synthesized based on the SPOT technique and pure peptides 95 purity were synthesized on resin using solid phase Fmoc peptide chemistry.The 135 peptides in the peptide library were screened for antimicrobial activity using both luminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain H1001 and non- luminescent epidemic methicillin resistant S. aureus EMRSA-15 Sal.

Cells were treated at 3x MIC peptide concentration for 1 h. Scale bars are 200 or 500 nm as shown on micrographsMETHODSFunctional antimicrobial activity screening of a rumen metagenomic libraryA metagenomic library consisting of 8448 clones from a plant-associated rumen microbiome was prepared previously.The clones were transferred gently using multichannel pin replicators Molecular Devices Ltd Berkshire UK onto Luria-Bertani agar plates containing a lawn 500 ul of S. aureus MSSA RN4220 E. coli K12 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 E. faecalis JH2-2 and L. monocytogenes NCTC 11994 serovar 4b OD600  1 using sterile pin replicators.

Cells were post-fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide wv stained with 2 wv uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and observed using a JEOL JEM1010 transmission electron microscope JEOL Ltd Tokyo Japan at 80 kV.Quantification of anti-biofilm activityThe effectiveness of Lynronne-1 Lynronne-2 and Lynronne-3 to preventa biofilm attachment and b disrupt established biofilms was measured using a 96-well biofilm model.Briefly MRSA cultures grown in brain heart infusion BHI broth were washed resuspended to an OD600nm  0.02 in BHI broth and a treated with peptides at 14x 12x 1x 2x and 4x MIC and incubated at 37 degC for 24 h or b incubated at 37 degC for 24 h to allow establishment of biofilms washed in PBS to remove planktonic cells and further incubated with peptides at 14x 12x 1x 2x and 4x MIC in fresh BHI broth at 37 degC for 24 h. The biofilms were washed in PBS to remove planktonic cells fixed with methanol stained with 0.5 wv crystal violet and re-solubilized with 33 vv acetic acid.

A peptide library consisting of 135 of these AMPs 25 amino acids AAs was synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activity using the SPOT technique synthesis of large numbers of peptides on marked spots on cellulose membrane sheets allowing for subsequent highthrough- put screening.Twenty-five active AMPs were identified in this screen Supplementary Table S2.

Assays were performed in sextuplicates to ensure reproducibility.Sequence-based screening of putative antimicrobial positive fosmid clonesFosmids with putative antimicrobial activity were sequenced using the Genome Sequencer FLX platform 454 Life Sciences according to manufacturer guidelines.

The optical density of biofilms was measured at 570 nm.In vivo efficacy of peptides in mouse models of MRSA skin and thigh infectionsThe efficacy of Lynronne-1 Lynronne-2 and Lynronne-3 for treating a wound infection caused by USA300 community-associated methicillin resistant S. aureus MRSA strain BAA-1717 was evaluated using a murine wound model with ICR mice.A sharp punch ID 12 mm was used to create excisional skin wounds in groups of five female ICR mice 5-6 weeks old.

BMC Bioinformatics 8 263 2007.Antimicrobial properties of rumen microbiome LB Oyama et al.9Hilpert K.  Hancock R. E. Use of luminescent bacteria for rapid screening and characterization of short cationic antimicrobial peptides synthesized on cellulose using peptide array technology.

Since cationic peptides rarely demonstrate high in vitro antimicrobial activities seen with some conventional antibiotics the MICs determined for Lynronne-1 Lynronne-2 and Lynronne-3 were not surprising and fall within the range of many commercially available AMPs.Lynronne-1 Lynronne-2 and Lynronne-3 at 3x MIC hadrelatively faster bactericidal activity against three MRSA strains when compared to vancomycin a first line drug for MRSA Fig.

Following sequence assembly using the default parameters on the gsAssembler software v.2.5.3 Roche Life Sciences sequences were trimmed and vector sequence were removed using BioEdit version 7.1.11.VecScreen on NCBI was used to search the sequences for vector contamination.

ORFs were determined using NCBI's ORF finder on the NCBI blast suite v2.2.28.In silico identification of AMPsPrediction of AMP sequences within the identified ORFs was achieved using a variety of software available at various public databases.
