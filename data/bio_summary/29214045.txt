the optical density of biofilms was measured at 570 nm.in vivo efficacy of peptides in mouse models of mrsa skin and thigh infectionsthe efficacy of lynronne-1 lynronne-2 and lynronne-3 for treating a wound infection caused by usa300 community-associated methicillin resistant s. aureus mrsa strain baa-1717 was evaluated using a murine wound model with icr mice.a sharp punch id 12 mm was used to create excisional skin wounds in groups of five female icr mice 5-6 weeks old.

since cationic peptides rarely demonstrate high in vitro antimicrobial activities seen with some conventional antibiotics the mics determined for lynronne-1 lynronne-2 and lynronne-3 were not surprising and fall within the range of many commercially available amps.lynronne-1 lynronne-2 and lynronne-3 at 3x mic hadrelatively faster bactericidal activity against three mrsa strains when compared to vancomycin a first line drug for mrsa fig.

in order to compete bacteria often up-regulate genes encoding amps to kill other bacteria in the community.the rumen is an example of such a highly competitive community with a very complex microbiome composed of unique and diverse range of bacteria archaea protozoa fungi and virusesand as such is apotentially unique resource for novel amp discovery.-in the past few years it has become apparent that culture dependent methods to evaluate microbial populations substantially under- estimates the diversity of microorganisms present and only around 10-20 of the species from the rumen environment have been cultured to date.the limitations surrounding culturability and antimicrobial discovery can be circumvented using sequence and functional-based metagenomics which allow mining of whole microbiomes for novel bioactive compounds.here we report the discovery and characterization of three amps i.e.
