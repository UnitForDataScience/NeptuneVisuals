They were separated from their mother for 8 h and acclimated to these housing conditions for 1 week before any experimental manipulation.Rats were divided into five groups the gut microbiota disturbance group GMD n  8 received oral ampicillin-Na solution for 18 con- secutive days at postnatal days 10 the negative control group NC n  8 received oral phosphate-buffered saline in an equivalent volume and served as a negative control the gut microbiota disturbance and probiotic administration GMD  P n  8 group was provided a mixture of living Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum for 12 consecutive days after the establishment of the gut microbiota dis- turbance model the gut microbiota disturbance and drug BZ clona- zepam treatment group GMD  D n  8 received drug treatment for2 weeks after the establishment of the gut microbiota disturbance model the blank control group BC n  8 was not treated.Animal model of GMDThe important role of antibiotics is in combating bacterial infection but drug abuse can stimulate the disturbance of the gastrointestinal system gut microbiota .

The results show that significantly higher Enterococcus and E. coli counts p  0.05 and significantly lower Lactobacillus counts p  0.05 were measured in each group fed with ampicillin-Na after the establishment of the gut microbiota disturbance model compared with the blank control group and the negative control group which indicated that diversity and abundance were reduced in each group fed with ampicillin-Na .

Post hoc analysis indicated that the performance of the GMD group was inferior to that of other groups except for the GMD  D group across several days of testing.
