It has been shown that imbalance of microbiota ecosystem caused by repeated exposure to antibiotic can increase the frequency of some types of cancer such as lung cancer suggesting a relationship between microbiota and carcinogenesis 10.

This difference linked to microbiota was immune-mediated with tumor-specific T-cell responses and intratumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration significantly higher in mice with Bifidobacterium in commensal microbiota.

It is in this case that microbiota and more precisely gut microbiota can play an important role.

Tumor grew more aggressively in the group with a failing microbiota lacking in Bifidobacterium spp but it could be ablated by co-housing with mice with favorable microbiota or by transferring fecal material from one group to the other.

Due to the lack of data on lung cancer and heterogeneity of response to immunotherapy for these patients we decided to retrospectively search for a link between exposure to antibiotic medication consequently affecting the microbiota and response to nivolumab in a cohort of 74 patients with lung cancer treated with this antibody.Materials and MethodsPatients.

In contradiction to results for patients with renal carcinoma and in mouse models we found no link between exposure to antibiotic medication and consequently of the microbiota and response to nivolumab.
