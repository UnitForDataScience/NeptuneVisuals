Diversity shifts in tumor microbiota have been observed in a variety of cancers including prostate cancer  cervical cancer  colorectal cancer   and lung cancer   and breast cancer -.Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide and despite the sig- nificant progress in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers there are still more than 40000 deaths per year  .

The concordant set of 327 OTU's that were observed among the four clusters was normalized and scaled .Pairwise differential abundance analysis of the 327 OTU's was performed among the four tissue groups NCA HER2 ER and triple negative breast cancer .

Interestingly the vast majority 75 36 of 48 were found to comprise less prevalent OTU's less than 0.5 on an average in the NCA.While this may be attributed to the tumor-biased nature of the TCGA data it could also sug- gest that breast cancer studies with limited sampling power coupled with sparse microbiome data could be inadequate for accurate signal detection.

The remainder of the less prevalent microbiota on average comprises 14.7 of the NCA microbiota 11.1 of the triple negative microbiota 12.8 of the HER2 microbiota and 12.5 of the ER microbiota.OTU's significantly different among the breast cancer populations.

C The average relative abundance and standard deviation of the 12species differing in abundance depicted in the barplots with the NCA tissue cohort's averages in green and tumor cohort averages in purple.Significant OTU's.

Similarly the majority 6 of the nine OTU's significantly altered from NCA tissues were also comprised from the less prevalent OTU's.

Additionally we observed an increased presence of Actinobacteria 13 of 48 significant OTU's in the NCA tissue samples while Proteobacteria 20 of the 48 significant OTU's demonstrated increased presence among the tumor tissues see .Microbial association with breast cancerWe investigated whether the microbial composition was associated with alterations in thehost expression profiles.

A PCA plot of these significant OTU's is presented demonstrating that the batch differences had been accounted for NCA tissues indicated with an 'N' and tumor samples indicated with a 'T'.Phylum compositions of the tumor and NCA tissues.

EdgeR analysis was performed between the NCA tissue and the breast cancer subtype tissue using host gene expression data.
