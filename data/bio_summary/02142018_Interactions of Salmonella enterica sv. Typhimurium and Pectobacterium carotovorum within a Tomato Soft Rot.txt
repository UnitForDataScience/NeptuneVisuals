from soft rot disease are due to their ability to scavenge starch via amyA and malSwas proven null.Transposon insertion analysis reveals differences between metabolic path- ways necessary for growth in the intact and soft rot tomatoes.

Overall there was a large number of mutations that reduced Salmonella fitness in the soft rot and nearly as many mutants that benefited from the soft rot.

Dots represent significant differences FDR 0.05 in the fold change of mutants grown in both tomatoes with soft rot and with no sot rot.

Additionally with the exception of rfaF which was less competitive in both the soft rot and intact tomatoes mutants in the lipopolysaccharide LPS genes were less compet- itive in the intact tomato than in soft rot.

These data show that S. Typhimurium 14028 does not use the same essential functions in soft rot and intact tomato tissue.Nucleotide synthesis is required for growth of Salmonella in soft rot.

The log10 of the out ratios of tomatoes with no soft rot no SR and those with soft rot SR were then compared.

Our finding that motility is disadvantageous in tomato soft rot compared to intact tomatoes is surprising but consistent with the previously described transcriptome of Salmonella Typhimurium in cilantro and lettuce leaf macerated by a closely related soft rot pathogen D. dadantii .

Here we aimed to uncover the mechanisms that enable Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 to benefit from the degradation of plant tissue by a soft rot plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum.

The hypothesis that in the soft rot the liberation of starch not utilized by P. carotovorum makes this polymer available to Salmonella spp.

To identify the functions in- volved in Salmonella soft rot colonization we carried out transposon insertion se- quencing coupled with the phenotypic characterization of the mutants.
