In general 5-HT partially metabolizes to the glucuronide-5-HT metabolite5-HT-O-glucuronide in the liver  hence we hypothesized that the deconjugation process by bacterial enzymes may also contribute to free luminal 5-HT production in the gut.To evaluate this possibility in the current study we determined luminal 5-HT levels throughout the gastrointestinal tract and examined the involvement of gut microbes in the regulation of luminal 5-HT using germ-free GF mice and gnotobiotic mice that were recolo- nized with the fecal flora from specific pathogen-free SPF mice EX-GF mice.Materials and methodsAnimalsGF and gnotobiotic mice were kept and treated according to previously reported methods   .

Tissue 5-HT levels in the colon were significantly higher in the EX-GF mice than in the GF mice P  0.05 however there were no significant differences in either cecal or ileal tissue 5-HT levels between groups.Substantial elevation of 5-HT concentrations in the gut lumen after exposure to gut microbesVarious kinds of substances derived from the gut microbiota are known to have the ability to induce the release of 5-HT from EC cells  .

To reconstitute the GF mice with SPF gut microbiota the parent GF mice were orally given the feces of male SPF mice.

Therefore to clarify the con- tribution of gut microbes to the production of free 5-HT levels in the gut lumen both the freeLuminal and tissue 5-HT concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free GF mice and GF mice reconstituted with SPF mouse feces.

The majority of 5-HT was in the free form in the EX-GF mice whereas more than 50 of the 5-HT was in the glucuronide-conjugated form in the GF mice indicating the critical role of gut microbes in the production of biologically active free 5-HT.Uribe and co-workers  reported that the microbiota influences the number of gut endo- crine cells and the release of biologically active peptides based on comparisons between GF and conventional rats.

Therefore to further clarify the involvement of gut microbes in the production of 5-HT in the gut lumen we examined the time course changes in the 5-HT levels in the gut lumen of the GF mice upon exposure to the fecal micro- biota of SPF mice.As shown in  the association with SPF microbiota rapidly induced a drastic elevation in luminal 5-HT levels in the cecum  and colon .

Taken together these results indicate that gut microbes play a crucial role in promoting luminal 5-HT produc- tion and that the deconjugation process of glucuronide-conjugated 5-HT by bacterial enzymes may contribute to the enhanced production of free 5-HT in the gut lumen.DiscussionRecent research via animal experiments and human studies suggests that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in 5-HT synthesis and its regulation in the gut lumen.

Htr3a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A Htr4 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 Tph1 tryptophan hydroxylase 1 Slc6a4 solute carrier family 6 member 4.and conjugated forms were measured in the colons of GF mice and compared with those in the EX-GF mice.As shown in and  approximately 90 of the 5-HT was found in an unconju- gated free form in the EX-GF mice whereas more than 50 of the 5-HT was found in a glu- curonide-conjugated form in the GF mice.

In support of this interaction the present study showed that EX-GF mice which were GF mice reconstituted with SPF microbiota had higher levels of luminal 5-HT in the cecum and colon as well as whole-colon 5-HT levels compared with the GF mice.

Our previous work with gnotobiotic mice showed that free catecholamines can be produced by the deconjugation of conjugated catecholamines hence we speculated that deconjugation by bacterial enzymes may be one of the mechanisms whereby gut microbes can produce free 5-HT in the gut lumen.
