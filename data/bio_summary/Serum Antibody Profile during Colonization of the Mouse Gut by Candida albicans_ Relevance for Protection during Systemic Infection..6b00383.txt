Colonized mice are represented with black circles infected mice with red squares and colonized and infected mice with black and red triangles.

The untreated mouse group exhibited a weight loss from the beginning of the experiment until day 8 where the damage was up to 50 of the initial weight thus reflecting the lethality of the challenge.The survival rate of the mice from both models C and CI after the lethal challenge is shown in C. These data suggested that colonized mice developed protection against a lethal fungal challenge as reflected by a significant increase in the survival percentage compared with the untreated mice group C vs untreated group p  0.05 CI vs untreated group p  0.05.DISCUSSIONThe opportunistic pathogen C. albicans exists as a commensal member of the mammalian microbiome of the GI tract from healthy humans.

A sublethal systemic infection was generated after injecting a low inoculum of 105 C. albicans cells in the lateral vein of six noncolonized mice and six colonized mice at day 10 of colonization and maintained along 30 days.Fungal Burden.

Serum samples were collected from the submaxillary vein of all the mice in each of the three models six mice per group at different days.

In this model after confirmation of fungal gut establishment B colonized mice were then infected in the lateral vein with a sublethal dose of the fungus see below.To check out gut colonization of these mice we measured the fungal presence in the stools as reported previously Figure 3.

p  0.05 when colonized mice were compared with infected mice p  0.01 when the C model was compared with the CI model p  0.001 when the I model was compared with the CI model.B.

A group of untreated mice was also employed as a control of the lethality of the inoculum.We also tested the healthy state of the different groups of mice both before data not shown and after the lethal fungal challenge in the same way as described above.

After 10 days mice recovered their initial weight and after 15 days the colonized mice showed a weight similar to the beginning of the assay.

C Survival of colonized mice and colonized plus infected mice.

This is a new approach using immunocompetent and healthy mice compared with the methods described in the literature because all of them employed immunosuppressed mice.These models have proved to be a useful tool for studying the immune response induced after C. albicans colonization in the face of immunodeficiency.We observed that serum anti-C. albicans antibody levels were significantly higher in colonized mice C and CI models than in the control serum obtained on day 0.
