All three ligands robustly activated STAT3 in organoids and this effect was prevented when neutralizing antibodies against each ligand were added H. Interestingly IL-6 was able to strongly activate STAT3 in tumor organoids in contrast to studies using acinar cells isolated from KrasG12D mice that concluded that IL-6 trans-signaling is necessary to mediate robust STAT3 activa- tion in pancreatic tumor cells STAT3 was also activated by the addition of co-culture conditioned media to tumor organoids in monoculture and this activation was again blocked by addition of neutralizing antibodies with the anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody having the most prom- inent effect I.As STAT3 activation is known to control cell survival and proliferation we investigated its role in co-culture by using CRISPRCas9 gene editing to knockout IL-6 in two PSC lines.

S1 K. Interestingly whereas organoids co-cultured with WT PSCs showed as expected prolonged passaging ability in reduced media conditions compared with monocultured organoids continued passaging of organoids was impaired in co-cultures with IL-6-deficient PSCs J.These re- sults demonstrate that tumor organoids in co-culture activate PSCs to secrete multiple factors which in turn activate sig- naling pathways in organoids that sustain survival.To further investigate the secretory phenotype of or- ganoid-activated PSCs we exposed quiescent PSCs to organ- oid-conditioned media Fig.

Although cancer-naive PSCs embedded alone in Matrigel re- mained quiescent PSCs in co-culture with tumor organoids acquired a CAF phenotype demonstrated by morphologi- cal activation with cellular extensions in close contact with tumor organoids B.

Mouse CAFs cultured with tumor organoid-conditioned media also increased Il6 and concomitantly lost Acta2 expres- sion N. Although to a lesser extent this pattern was also present in primary CAFs isolated from human primary and metastatic PDA samples when cultured with conditioned media from patient-matched tumor organoids O.Previous studies have shown that pancreatic cancer cells induce IL-6 secretion in fibroblasts and PSCs and that PSCs are a major source of IL-6 in PDA FOur data confirm this trait in cancer-naive PSCs that are allowed to interact with cancer cells as well as in mouse and human PDA-derived CAFs.

JAKs in turn phosphorylate and activate sig- nal transducer and activator of transcription STAT factors most notably STAT3 which plays key roles in cell growth and proliferation Immunofluo- rescence staining revealed detectable activation of STAT3 in KPC tumors both in cancer cells and the surrounding stroma G. To confirm that tumor organoids activate STAT3 in response to paracrine stimuli we measured STAT3 phos- phorylation in organoids after the addition of recombinant IL-6 IL-11 and LIF to the media.

In total two IL-6 KO lines and two control lines were made from two parental PSC lines.co-culture and passaging of tumor organoids and cAFsFor co-cultures mouse or human organoids were split at a 16 ratio and mixed with 1x104 PSCs or CAFs seeded in Matrigel and cultured in DMEM containing 5 FBS and 1 PenicillinStreptomycin.

Secretion of IL-6 was induced in both pri- mary tumor and metastatic co-cultures whereas secretion of IL-11 and LIF was only induced in the co-culture derived from the primary tumor hT1 F.Once dimerized with IL6RA GP130 is phosphorylated and forms a complex with tyrosine kinases such as Janus ki- nases JAKs.

Such heteroge- neity has previously been unappreciated likely due to the fact that monolayers of fibroblasts uniformly express highlevels of aSMA in culture.Notably the marked drop in bulk aSMA expression induced by organoid-conditioned media K con-trasted with the presence of CAFs expressing high levels of aSMA in proximity to neoplastic cells observed in co-cul- tures K and in vivo We therefore hypothesized the coexistence of two distinct subtypes of CAFs in co-culture and PDA tissue one being aSMAhighIL-6low and proximal to the neoplastic cells myCAFs andthe other being aSMAlow IL-6high induced by paracrine sig- naling from the tumor compartment and more distantly dis- tributed throughout the tumor.

Fibroblast outgrowth was observed in the 10-cm dishes within 48 h.
