all known vitamin k vitamers share bioactivity as enzyme cofactors of the g-glutamate carboxylase enzyme responsible for activating multiple vitamin k-dependent proteins 6 7. however bioavailability and bio- activity appear to differ across vitamers with evidence supporting superior bioavailability 26-29 greater bioactivity and possibly unique functions of some bacterially derived menaquinone forms relative to phylloquinone 30-32. these observations suggest that even low amounts of gut bacteria-derived menaquinones could meaningfully affect health.despite longstanding knowledge that gut bacteria producemenaquinones 21 relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the menaquinone content of the human gut 33-35 identify factors contributing to variability in gut menaquinone content or elucidate to what extent menaquinones synthesized by gut bacteria affect human health.

to begin addressing these knowledge gaps our group recently used culture-independent 16s ribosomal dna sequencing to demonstrate that variability in human fecal menaquinone content is associated with relatively few genera within the gut microbiota and that diet-mediated al- terations in gut microbiota composition may provide a feasible approach for altering gut menaquinone content 36. however limitations to that effort included the inability to quantify fecal menaquinone concentrations assess dietary vitamin k intake or measure vitamin k status.

although the bioavail- ability of gut bacteria-derived menaquinones is poorly charac- terized most menaquinones synthesized by bacteria are thought to be embedded in bacterial cytoplasmic membranes whichwith recent evidence that menaquinones may be more abundant in the food supply than previously thought 24 25 precludes more definitive conclusions and highlights a need for greater characterization of dietary menaquinone content.regardless a requirement for gut bacteria-derived menaqui- nones to be absorbed from the gut to exert direct biological effects should not be assumed.

however the relevance of menaquinones produced by gut bacteria to vitamin k requirements and inflammation is undetermined.objective this study aimed to quantify fecal menaquinone con- centrations and identify associations between fecal menaquinoneintroductionemerging evidence suggests novel roles for vitamin k in health and disease beyond the vitamin's canonical function in hemostasis 1-5. underpinning mechanisms have been attrib- uted both to diverse actions of extrahepatic vitamin k-dependent proteins 6 7 and to pathways that are independent of vitamin k's enzyme cofactor activity 2 4 5 8. of particular interest isconcentrations and serum vitamin k concentrations gut microbiota composition and inflammation.design fecal and serum menaquinone concentrations fecal microbiota composition and plasma and fecal cytokine concentrations were mea- sured in 80 men and postmenopausal women 48 men 32 women age 40-65 y enrolled in a randomized parallel-arm provided-food trial.

menaquinones were not detected in serum and neither fecal concentrations of individual menaquinones nor the menaqui- none group was associated with any marker of inflammation.conclusion menaquinone concentrations in the human gut appear highly variable and are associated with gut microbiota composition.

c 2017 american society for nutritionvitamin k and the gut microbiota1053the growing literature of in vitro 9-13 animal 12 14 and epidemiologic 15-17 studies suggesting anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin k. collectively these discoveries have con- tributed to increased interest in defining an optimal dietary vita- min k requirement 1. however one impediment to developing these recommendations is an incomplete understanding of the relevance of vitamin k produced by bacteria in the human gut to health.k vitamins are a family of fat-soluble vitamers that share a napthoquinone ring structure but differ in the length and satu- ration of an attached lipophilic side chain 8. phylloquinone vitamin k-1 is synthesized by plants 8 is the predominant dietary vitamin k form and is the form on which current dietary recommendations are based 18. menaquinone mkn with n representing the number of isoprenoid units in the side chain 4 differs from phylloquinone in that it has an unsaturated side chain is endogenously synthesized by mammals via the con- version of phylloquinone or menadione 19 and is found in some animal-based food products 20. additional menaquinone forms contain unsaturated side chains varying in length from 5 mk5 to 13 mk13 repeating isoprenoid units and are syn- thesized by bacteria 21-23. these bacterially derived mena- quinones are thought to be less abundant than phylloquinone in most diets although some fermented food products 20 dairy products 24 and meats 25 are sources.

current recommended adequate intakes for vitamin k as defined by the us institute of medicine are 90-120 mgd 200-266 nmold and based on us median intake of phylloquinone 18. the recommendations do not consider diet-derived menaquinones and the contribution of gut bacteria-derived menaquinones to the estimated aver- age requirement is unknown 1 18. in the present study the measured median daily mk5-mk13 excretion in feces equated to .3 times the current us adequate intake for phylloquinone.1058karl et al.figure 1 covariance between fecal vitamin k vitamers partitions individuals into distinct clusters or menaquinotypes which are associated with gut microbiota composition.

the inability to detect menaquinones in circulation unless concentrated doses are consumed is consistent with the current evidence base 53 and suggests that few menaquinones synthesized by gut bacteria are absorbed into systemic circulation despite high concentrations in the gut.

although our findings did not demonstrate associations be- tween fecal menaquinone concentrations and gut inflammation as measured by fecal cytokine concentrations multiple studies using in vitro and animal models have demonstrated that multiple vitamin k vitamers and their metabolites may reduce inflamma- tion 9-14. whether associations between fecal menaquinone concentrations and gut inflammation could be detected in populations with higher levels of inflammation or using more sensitive markers of intestinal inflammation warrants further investigation.figure 2 multiple taxa differentiate menaquinotypes.

although we hypothesized that fecal mena- quinone concentrations may account for some of the previously reported unexplained interindividual variability in serum phyl- loquinone concentrations 53 serum phylloquinone is not a sensitive indicator of functional vitamin k status 53. mea- suring more sensitive indicators of vitamin k status in future studies especially studies in which dietary vitamin k intake is inadequate could identify relations between fecal menaquinone content and vitamin k nutriture that are not reflected by serum phylloquinone or menaquinone concentrations.in summary menaquinones appear to be abundant in thehuman gut but demonstrate substantial variability in the con- centrations of different menaquinone forms likely because of variability in gut microbiota composition.

as such dietary ma- nipulation of gut microbiota composition and activity could plausibly provide a viable means of modulating gut menaquinone concentrations.
