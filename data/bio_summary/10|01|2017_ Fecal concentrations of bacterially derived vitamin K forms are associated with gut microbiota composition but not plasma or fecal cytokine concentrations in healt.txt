These observations suggest that even low amounts of gut bacteria-derived menaquinones could meaningfully affect health.Despite longstanding knowledge that gut bacteria producemenaquinones 21 relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the menaquinone content of the human gut 33-35 identify factors contributing to variability in gut menaquinone content or elucidate to what extent menaquinones synthesized by gut bacteria affect human health.

Menaquinones were not detected in serum and neither fecal concentrations of individual menaquinones nor the menaqui- none group was associated with any marker of inflammation.Conclusion Menaquinone concentrations in the human gut appear highly variable and are associated with gut microbiota composition.

Of particular interest isconcentrations and serum vitamin K concentrations gut microbiota composition and inflammation.Design Fecal and serum menaquinone concentrations fecal microbiota composition and plasma and fecal cytokine concentrations were mea- sured in 80 men and postmenopausal women 48 men 32 women age 40-65 y enrolled in a randomized parallel-arm provided-food trial.

To begin addressing these knowledge gaps our group recently used culture-independent 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing to demonstrate that variability in human fecal menaquinone content is associated with relatively few genera within the gut microbiota and that diet-mediated al- terations in gut microbiota composition may provide a feasible approach for altering gut menaquinone content 36.

In univariate analyses a total of 73 taxa were statistically significantly correlated with 1 vitamer at both time points P  0.05 of which 52 remained statistically sig- nificant Q  0.05 after linear mixed-model analysis and false- discovery rate adjustment Supplemental Table 4.DISCUSSIONThe primary findings of this study suggest that menaquinones are abundant in the human gut and that within the gut the con- centrations of different menaquinone forms demonstrate sub- stantial intra- and interindividual variability which is associated with variability in gut microbiota composition.

Although the bioavail- ability of gut bacteria-derived menaquinones is poorly charac- terized most menaquinones synthesized by bacteria are thought to be embedded in bacterial cytoplasmic membranes whichwith recent evidence that menaquinones may be more abundant in the food supply than previously thought 24 25 precludes more definitive conclusions and highlights a need for greater characterization of dietary menaquinone content.Regardless a requirement for gut bacteria-derived menaqui- nones to be absorbed from the gut to exert direct biological effects should not be assumed.

Procrustes analysis indicated congruence between the first 3 principal coordinates extracted from the PCA of fecal vitamin K content and the principal coordinates analysis of gut microbiota composition M2  0.66 Monte Carlo P  0.001 Figure 1D indicating that variability in fecal vitamin K vitamer concentrations was associated with variability in gut microbiota composition.Linear discriminant analysis of effect size identified 98 fea- tures features are taxonomic assignments ranging from the OTU level to the kingdom level with an effect size of .3.0 which differed in relative abundance between menaquinotypes Figure 2 Supplemental Table 3.

MK menaquinone PC principal component PK phylloquinone post postintervention pre pre-intervention RG refined-grain based SI Silhouette Index WG whole-grain rich.This finding is consistent with and extends those of several studies limited by sample size and analytic methods incapable of measuring the full variability in gut menaquinone content 33-by demonstrating substantial intra- and interindividual var- iability in the concentrations of different menaquinone forms in the gut.

The inability to detect menaquinones in circulation unless concentrated doses are consumed is consistent with the current evidence base 53 and suggests that few menaquinones synthesized by gut bacteria are absorbed into systemic circulation despite high concentrations in the gut.

As such dietary ma- nipulation of gut microbiota composition and activity could plausibly provide a viable means of modulating gut menaquinone concentrations.
