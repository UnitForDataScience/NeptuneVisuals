Likewise fecal concentrations expressed as nmolg dry weight and total daily excretion in feces expressed as nmold of individual vitamers were not associated with any marker of inflammation measured in feces or plasma data not shown.Interrelationships between fecal vitamin K content and gut microbiota compositionThere were 5341 unique OTUs which classified into 10 bacterial phyla 69 genera and 49 additional phylotypes that could not be classified to the genus level that were detected inVITAMIN K AND THE GUT MICROBIOTA1057TABLE 2Serum and fecal vitamin K before and after consuming a refined grain-based or whole grain-rich diet for 6 wk1Refined grain n  39Whole grain n  40 or 412Week 2DWeek 2-8Week 2DWeek 2-8P3Serum nmolLFecal nmolg dry weight1 Values are medians IQRs.

However the relevance of menaquinones produced by gut bacteria to vitamin K requirements and inflammation is undetermined.Objective This study aimed to quantify fecal menaquinone con- centrations and identify associations between fecal menaquinoneINTRODUCTIONEmerging evidence suggests novel roles for vitamin K in health and disease beyond the vitamin's canonical function in hemostasis 1-5.

Of particular interest isconcentrations and serum vitamin K concentrations gut microbiota composition and inflammation.Design Fecal and serum menaquinone concentrations fecal microbiota composition and plasma and fecal cytokine concentrations were mea- sured in 80 men and postmenopausal women 48 men 32 women age 40-65 y enrolled in a randomized parallel-arm provided-food trial.

However when fecal vitamer concentrations were expressed as total daily excretion in feces only between-group differences in MK13 were statisti- cally significant after Bonferroni's correction Table 2 Supple- mental Table 2 because of the increase in daily fecal mass in the WG diet group compared with the RG diet group.
