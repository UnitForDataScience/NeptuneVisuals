The type III IFNs are under positive selection with long-term persistence of duplicate copies suggesting a critical biological role for type III IFNs independent from type I IFNs .

IRF1 plays a unique role in type III IFN induction however being specifically stimulated by peroxisome- associated MAVS in contrast to mitochondrial-associated MAVS which better induces type I IFNsIntestinal epithelial cells IECs produce type III IFNs with in vivo viral infection -.

However leukocytes gener- ate IFN-l in vitro   and intestinal eosinophils  and plasmacytoid dendritic cells pDCs  can produce IFN-l in vivo suggesting the possibility of additional cellular IFN-l contributors.While the antiviral programs induced by type I and type III IFNs exhibit substantial overlap -  a critical difference between the two is the cell types they affect secondary to receptor expression.

MDA5 is critical for type I IFN responses to MNoV  type III IFN responses may be similarly regulated.

Finally avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus induce much more robust type III than type I IFN in a primary chicken IEC culture model suggesting a possible role for IFN-l in prevention of intestinal infection by these viruses normally associated with respiratory infections .

These initial findings point to the potential for a broad role for IFN-l in control of many differ- ent enteric viruses but additional studies are clearly needed to determine the breadth and depth of IFN-l-mediated regulation of viral infection in the intestine.iFn-l inTeRACTiOnS wiTH OTHeR SignALing PATHwAYSInterferon-lambda-mediated antiviral immunity in the intestine against rotavirus EDIM-RV and MNoV does not redundantly overlap with type I IFNs while there is redundancy between type I and III IFNs to control influenza SARS coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus in the lung and herpes simplex virus-2 in the genital tract reviewed in Ref.

Kinetic differences and synergistic antiviral effects between type I and type III interferon signaling indicate pathway independence.
