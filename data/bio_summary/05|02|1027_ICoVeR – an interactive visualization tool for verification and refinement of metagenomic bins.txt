results for icover are highlighted in bold fontdisplayed with icover and the complete set of files ready to be refined is available online for prospective users  t. another advantage of icover in terms of big datasets is the very large number of samples variables that can be used for analysis while only the samples capturing the contig co-abundance profiles which may render the refinement process more efficient can be se- lected to be displayed in the parallel coordinates view.while icover currently allows users to include the out- put of different automated binning algorithms one poten- tial avenue for future work is to allow for algorithms such as concoct mycc or metabat to be configured and run as part of the icover workflow.

in icover to reinforce the selection of contigs we rely on a selection of bacterial domain-specific 109 escgs future implementation of a real-time display of the microbial lineage-specific information of complete- ness and contamination for a selection of contigs would likely improve the quality of recovered genomes.

however the binning of assembled metage- nomic contigs into individual genomes still remains a significant challenge.the combination of tetra-nucleotide frequencies tnfs sequence-dependent contig binning with contigs' differ- ential abundance spectra sequence-independent contig binning has resulted recently in the development ofc the authors.

to determine the average coverage of contigs for each metagenome sample reads were de-replicated and mapped back to the de novo assembled contigs using the rna-seq analysis mode with a minimum similarity of 0.8 over 0.9 of the read length and using the 'count paired-reads as two' mode.

only contigs above 1000 bp were considered 2329 contigs.

for concoct the maximum number of clusters was setup to 34. the draft genome quality classification scheme is as proposed by table 2 completeness and contamination for 31 icover-refined genome bins for ad microbiome datasetmetabat1 - 'sensitivespecific' mode metabat2 - 'superspecific' modeanumber corresponds to the icover-refined bin table s2bmarker lineage was defined by checkmcmetagenomic abundance corresponds to the  of reads mapping to the contigs binned inside each bindbased on the wide range in the gc content the pattern of contigs abundances across the multiple samples and the level of contamination we judged this bin to be a mixture of several low abundant organisms.

as such they represent straightforward methods for selecting a possibly inter- esting subset of variables to be visualized.as a pre-requisite for icover a user must provide 1 a co-assembly file in the fasta format containing all co-assembled contig sequences for all the metagenomic samples to be analyzed 2 a contig coverage abundance file in the csv format calculated for each metagenomic sample separately 3 an escgs file in the csv format containing all the predicted escgs for all co-assembled contigs and 4 a clustering file in the csv format op- tional with binning results from one or more automated binning tools that the user wants to refine.

paired-end connections for the different contigs grouping into the resulting genome bins were visualized with circos  using the pipeline described in .sharon's dataseta human infant gut microbiome  was used to further validate icover.

moreover it allows a level of freedom that exceeds even the approach implemented in anvi'o  where the clustering profiles are currently limited either to cover- age information tnfs or the combination of both.in addition to these two clustering algorithms dimen- sionality reduction techniques are provided in icover for selecting variables and contigs of interest.

accordingly the demonstrated advantage of combined bin refinement with icover against metagenomic binning results pro- duced by separate binning tools was further supported by the superior average bin completeness contamination and f1 scores table current and future perspectives on genome bins visualization and refinement with icovereven though most of the different automated binning al- gorithms that have emerged in the last couple of years combine both the tnfs alternatively pnfs information and the contigs co-abundances their different underlying algorithms lead to disparate genome bins.

here we initially tested icover using a relatively small ad microbiome dataset over 30000 contigs which was already too big to be entirely refined by anvi'o.

additionally to benchmark icover against a previously validated dataset we used sharon's dataset representing an infant gut metagenome.conclusions icover is an open source software package that allows curation of disparate genome bins generated with automatic binning algorithms.

moreover we further used icover to refine genome bins for an infant gut metagenome  previously validated with concoct  groopm  maxbin2  metabat and mycc .implementationoverview of icover softwareicover was designed as a visualization and refinement interface and not as primary binning software.

as such the research conducted here was totally independent from any influence from the funding body.availability of data and materialsall data and materials are available as supplementary files or can be downloaded from the software website icover is released under gplv3 license.authors' contributionsbb fmg kw developed icover and helped to draft the manuscript.

metagenomic analyses result in a large number of genomic fragments contigs that need to be grouped binned in order to reconstruct draft microbial genomes.
