A step-by-step description on how to load the data and refine contig bins is provided online for a few ICoVeR- refined genome bins  .Table 1 Summary of genome bins for AD microbiome dataset reconstructed with different binning algorithmsBinningNo genomeCompletenessContaminationMetaBAT1 - 'sensitivespecific' mode MetaBAT2 - 'superspecific' modeaFor ICoVeR bold font 31 pre-selected and the most complete genome bins 50 completeness based on MyCC genome bins were refinedCompleteness and contamination were calculated with CheckM.

The draft genome quality classification scheme is as proposed by Table 2 Completeness and contamination for 31 ICoVeR-refined genome bins for AD microbiome datasetMetaBAT1 - 'sensitivespecific' mode MetaBAT2 - 'superspecific' modeaNumber corresponds to the ICoVeR-refined bin Table S2bMarker lineage was defined by CheckMcMetagenomic abundance corresponds to the  of reads mapping to the contigs binned inside each bindBased on the wide range in the GC content the pattern of contigs abundances across the multiple samples and the level of contamination we judged this bin to be a mixture of several low abundant organisms.

Results for ICoVeR are highlighted in bold fontdisplayed with ICoVeR and the complete set of files ready to be refined is available online for prospective users  t. Another advantage of ICoVeR in terms of big datasets is the very large number of samples variables that can be used for analysis while only the samples capturing the contig co-abundance profiles which may render the refinement process more efficient can be se- lected to be displayed in the parallel coordinates view.While ICoVeR currently allows users to include the out- put of different automated binning algorithms one poten- tial avenue for future work is to allow for algorithms such as CONCOCT MyCC or MetaBAT to be configured and run as part of the ICoVeR workflow.

NB - no genome bin assignedNone of the automated binning algorithms produced a single set of genome bins with highest completeness and lowest contamination Table Data visualization with ICoVeR helped to improve the completeness and to reduce the contamination for 23 out of 31 refined genome bins.

Accordingly the demonstrated advantage of combined bin refinement with ICoVeR against metagenomic binning results pro- duced by separate binning tools was further supported by the superior average bin completeness contamination and F1 scores Table Current and future perspectives on genome bins visualization and refinement with ICoVeREven though most of the different automated binning al- gorithms that have emerged in the last couple of years combine both the TNFs alternatively PNFs information and the contigs co-abundances their different underlying algorithms lead to disparate genome bins.

MyCC has been recently identified as the most suitable binning and visualization tool when applied to small sample sizes  Here automated binning with MyCC resulted in 49 bins 30 of which were around 50 complete microbial genomes with low 5 13 genome bins and medium 5 to 10 10 genome bins level of contamination Additional file Table S1.Visualization and refinement of AD microbiome bins with ICoVeRAlthough visualization with ICoVeR facilitates whole community analysis for some datasets of high microbial complexity the refinement process of all generated gen- ome bins might be time-consuming.

Here we used CheckM to estimate the completeness and contamin- ation of the resulting MetaBAT CONCOCT and MyCC genome bins in order to prioritize most complete gen- ome bins for further refinement with ICoVeR Tables and In total we selected 31 genome bins with around 50 of completeness based on the CheckM re- sults for the different automated binning algorithms these bins can be visualised using a running instance of the tool preloaded with AD microbiome dataset http icover.list.lu4200ocpuusericoverlibraryICoVeRwww.

Further biological interpret- ation of the obtained results is outside of the scope of the present paper and will be discussed elsewhere manuscript in preparation.Refinement of genome bins with ICoVeR for a previously validated Sharon's datasetRecovering genome bins from mock communities simulated datasets was previously shown to yield very high precision the absence of foreign DNA and recall percent of expected ESCGs that are binned for the tested automated binning algorithms compared to the same simulated datasets in .

Paired-end connections for the different contigs grouping into the resulting genome bins were visualized with Circos  using the pipeline described in .Sharon's datasetA human infant gut microbiome  was used to further validate ICoVeR.

In ICoVeR to reinforce the selection of contigs we rely on a selection of bacterial domain-specific 109 ESCGs Future implementation of a real-time display of the microbial lineage-specific information of complete- ness and contamination for a selection of contigs would likely improve the quality of recovered genomes.
