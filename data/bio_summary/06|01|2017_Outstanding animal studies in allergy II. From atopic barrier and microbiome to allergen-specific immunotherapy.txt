1c f insect bite hypersensitivity is a common problem in horses which could be prevented by intralym- phatic injections with recombinant insect allergens adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid a mpl or aluminium hydroxide conclusioninnovative efforts were undertaken in models for atopic dermatitis by exploiting mediators previously correlated with atopic dermatitis such as il-23 or using il-6 for biomonitoring atopic dermatitis 12notably it was demonstrated that the atopicdermatitis microbiota was transferable and vice versa inoculation of mouse skin with healthy microbiota corrected the disease novel mouse models helped to understand the significance of the skin barrier enzymatic allergens and physico- chemical factors like skin ph.

when microbiota from healthy controls or from atopic dermatitis patients were inoculated in mc903 atopic dermatitis mice only the microbiome from the healthy were able to control s. aureus growth and even corrected the atopic dermatitis.
