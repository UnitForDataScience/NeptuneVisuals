1c f insect bite hypersensitivity is a common problem in horses which could be prevented by intralym- phatic injections with recombinant insect allergens adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A MPL or aluminium hydroxide CONCLUSIONInnovative efforts were undertaken in models for atopic dermatitis by exploiting mediators previously correlated with atopic dermatitis such as IL-23 or using IL-6 for biomonitoring atopic dermatitis 12Notably it was demonstrated that the atopicdermatitis microbiota was transferable and vice versa inoculation of mouse skin with healthy microbiota corrected the disease Novel mouse models helped to understand the significance of the skin barrier enzymatic allergens and physico- chemical factors like skin pH.

When microbiota from healthy controls or from atopic dermatitis patients were inoculated in MC903 atopic dermatitis mice only the microbiome from the healthy were able to control S. aureus growth and even corrected the atopic dermatitis.

Several animal models mostly in mice have been created or applied recently to mimic atopic dermatitis and to understand these interconnected problems.Immune Effects of the Microflora in Atopic DermatitisAlthough pathogenic skin bacteria via interleukin IL-23 strongly boost Th1Th17 inflammation other stimuli such as enzymes via protease-activated receptor PAR-2 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin TSLP trigger Th2 responses involving basophil- derived IL-4 Both counteracting axes contribute to the mixed phenotype in human atopic dermatitis patients and could in fact be mimicked in mouse and canine models In a transcriptomic profiling study however IL-23-injected NCNgaTnd Fig.

Only gram-negative bac- teria collected from healthy controls but not from atopic dermatitis patients were able to maintain barrier integrity and control of Staphylococcus when inoculated in MC903 atopic dermatitis mice 12 suggesting a 'live-biotherapeutic approach' for human patients.The chronic aspects in atopic eczema are accom- panied by IL-6 induction.

On tape stripped skin papain acted as adjuvant for another model aller- gen ovalbumin and primed specific respiratory hypersensitivity mirroring the atopic march.Interestingly silver particles adjuvanted house dust mite proteins to become percutaneous aller- gens thereby aggravating atopic dermatitis and activating mast cells .Intrinsic barrier defects play a major role in the development of atopic dermatitis.

Intriguingly it could be healed by application of acidic skin cream Reduced expression of tight junction compound claudin-1 correlated with more severe atopic derma- titis in mice Being pronounced in infancy symptoms improved with age imitating the course of human atopic eczema.Also adherens junctions contribute to the regu- lation of the extracellular matrix in a cadherin-11 knockout mouse model cutaneous levels of elastin and collagen as well as mechanical properties were significantly reduced .By concentrating on keratinocyte turnover another useful atopic dermatitis model was devel- oped epidermis-restricted ablation of the proto- oncogene BRAFRAF1 led to barrier defects and local and systemic IgE and Th2 inflammation Janus kinase inhibition prevented disease onset In terms of potential novel therapies in atopic dermatitis a proof-of-concept study in NCNga mice sensitized by papain revealed that Bacillus- derived poly-g-glutamic acid-treatment inducedinvariant natural killer T cells driving basophils into apoptosis thereby correcting the pronounced Th2 inflammation Astaxanthin a xanthophyll carotenoid  and AM1030 a serotonin antagonist  showed promising anti-inflammatory effects and targeted the itch in NCNga mice.

Allergen-specific oral tol- erance could be achieved in an atopic dermatitis mouse model epicutaneously sensitized to oval- bumin with practical implications in human atopic dermatitis patients suffering from exacer- bations due to the intake of dietary allergens .

J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017 139562 -571.In search for the ideal mouse model of atopic dermatitis the authors identify the IL- 23-injected NCNga and oxazolone-challenged mouse model to possess the largest homology to a human atopic dermatitis transcriptome from a meta-analysis.Olivry T Mayhew D Paps JS et al.
