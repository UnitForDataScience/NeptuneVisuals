in addition the presence or absence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria on fresh mushrooms was analysed to determine compliance with national guidance documents department of health 2000 and to provide a scientific-based mushroom assess- ment.results and discussionmicrobial load assessment on mushroomsbacterial counts ranged from 2-5 to 6-2 log cfu per g fungal counts between 0-0 and 2-7 log cfu per g and yeasts from 1-0 to 4-3 log cfu per g. average total cul- turable microbial counts ranged from 5-2 min to 12-4 max log cfu per g with the average total microbial count being 8-7 log cfu per g table 1. at the point-of- harvest fresh first break mushrooms showed a total microbial count of 5-2-10-1 log cfu per g and when packed 8-0-10-1 log cfu per g. similarly total microbial loads for second and third break mushrooms at harvest were determined to be 7-6-10-2 log cfu per g and 8-8- 11-5 log cfu per g respectively and correspondingly 8-3-10-5 log cfu per g and 9-5-12-4 log cfu per g when packed.

first break yeast counts were found to be in the range of 2-8 to 3-9 log cfu per g for preharvest and 2-9 to 4-0 log cfu per g for packaged mushrooms table 1. during the sec- ond break yeast counts showed a range varying from 2-3 to 3-9 log cfu per g for preharvest mushrooms and 3-5 to 3-9 log cfu per g for packaged mushrooms.

it can be deduced that a healthy safe mushroom can carry a total microbial load ranging between 5-2 log cfu per g and 12-4 log cfu per g depending on the relation between farm production phase and -break as well as growing room conditions from which the mush- rooms are harvested.microbial dynamics and succession between different production stagesvariable bacterial counts were observed during the pro- gression from first to third break and between each of the five rooms sampled.

farm 1 showed a higher coliform load throughout the production cycles and between preharvest and packaged samples within each cycle in contrast to farm 2 table 1. low counts of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and the absence of gram-negative bacteria were similarly described bytable 1 bacterial yeast fungal and thermotolerant coliform counts on fresh white button mushroomsmicrobial counts log cfu per g mean - standard deviation farm 1farm 2production phaseproduction cycle breakbacteriathermotolerantcoliformsyeastsfungibacteriathermotolerant coliforms yeastsfungiroom 1preharvest1st2-5 - 2-7 g2-5 - 0-3 efgh1-0 - 1-9 g1-7 - 1-1 bc5-6 - 0-7 abcde2-7 - 0-3 defg3-5 - 0-5 abcd nd2nd4-9 - 0-2 def2-8 - 0-3 cdefg 1-8 - 1-1 fg1-6 - 0-9 bcd 6-2 - 0-6 a2-8 - 0-3 defg4-1 - 0-5 and3rd5-4 - 0-3 abcdef 2-9 - 0-2 cdef4-0 - 0-4 ab1-8 - 0-3 b5-9 - 0-5 ab2-8 - 0-2 cdefg3-3 - 1-4 abcd ndpostpackaging1st4-7 - 1-9 f2-6 - 0-2 defg2-9 - 2-4 cdef0-4 - 0-8 ef5-7 - 0-8 abcd2-4 - 0-6 ghi3-8 - 0-6 abcnd2nd4-8 - 0-3 ef2-7 - 0-2 defg2-5 - 1-4 def1-9 - 0-8 b5-6 - 0-4 abcdef 2-8 - 0-4 defg3-6 - 0-6 abcnd3rd4-9 - 0-3 cdef2-8 - 0-2 cdefg 3-2 - 0-6 abcd 1-7 - 0-2 b5-5 - 2-3 abcdef 3-0 - 0-5 cde3-9 - 0-6 abndroom 2 preharvestpostpackagingtotal average microbial load 8-7 - 0-1 log cfu per gtotal microbial load range min-max 5-2-12-4 log cfu per gnd not detected counts below detection limit.for each column mean values followed by statistical t-grouping according to analysis with a two-way anova showing interaction effect between farms preharvest postpackaging rooms and production cycles breaks.

based on our research and similar studies it is proposed that specifications for microbial loads on fresh healthy mushrooms reflect a more natural microbiome at the point-of-harvest and point-of-sale.introductionviewed from a microbial-ecological perspective fresh pro- duce are commonly known to harbour a large diversity of microbial communities beuchat 1996. depending on the produce types microbial community composition can rapidly change and be influenced by a range of environ- mental factors such as temperature ph and moisture availability.

first break bacterial counts ranged from 5-4 to 6-2 log cfu per g for preharvest and 5-6 to 6-1 log cfu per g packaged mushrooms.

bacterial counts during second break fluctuated between 5-7 and 6-0 log cfu per g for preharvest and 5-7 to 6-2 log cfu per g for packaged mushrooms.

third break bacterial counts ranged from 5-6 to 6-1 log cfu per g for preharvest mushrooms and 5-9 to 6-1 log cfu per g for packaged mushrooms.

third break yeast counts ranged from 2-3 to 4-2 log cfu per g for preharvest mushrooms and 3-6 to 4-2 log cfu per g for packaged mushrooms.

the mean yeast counts across the different breaks were 3-5 log cfu per g for preharvest and 3-7 log cfu per g for packaged mushrooms.

total mushroom microbial counts ranged from 5-2 to 12-4 log cfu per g with the genus pseudomonas being most frequently isolated 45-37 of all isolations.

2011 indicated that the total microbial load on agaricus bisporus from packedretail samples ran- ged between 6 and 8 log cfu per g in a study to determine the safety and quality of various mushroom species.

2016 described microbial succession on healthy mushrooms at the point-of-harvest which represented a 4 to 5 log cfu per g representative of a climax bacterial community.

microbial loads could according to the previous authors reportedly increase to log 7 to 9 cfu per g depending on the storage condi- tions.

microbial loads found on fresh mush- rooms showed similarities and were comparable between the different growing rooms studied.the determined thermotolerant coliform load ranged from 2-54 to 3-71 log cfu per g table 1. no correla- tion could be found with reference to the progression of coliform load from first to third break.
