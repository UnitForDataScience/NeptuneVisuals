At the point-of- harvest fresh first break mushrooms showed a total microbial count of 5-2-10-1 log CFU per g and when packed 8-0-10-1 log CFU per g. Similarly total microbial loads for second and third break mushrooms at harvest were determined to be 7-6-10-2 log CFU per g and 8-8- 11-5 log CFU per g respectively and correspondingly 8-3-10-5 log CFU per g and 9-5-12-4 log CFU per g when packed.

In addition the presence or absence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria on fresh mushrooms was analysed to determine compliance with national guidance documents Department of Health 2000 and to provide a scientific-based mushroom assess- ment.Results and DiscussionMicrobial load assessment on mushroomsBacterial counts ranged from 2-5 to 6-2 log CFU per g fungal counts between 0-0 and 2-7 log CFU per g and yeasts from 1-0 to 4-3 log CFU per g. Average total cul- turable microbial counts ranged from 5-2 min to 12-4 max log CFU per g with the average total microbial count being 8-7 log CFU per g Table 1.

It can be deduced that a healthy safe mushroom can carry a total microbial load ranging between 5-2 log CFU per g and 12-4 log CFU per g depending on the relation between farm production phase and -break as well as growing room conditions from which the mush- rooms are harvested.Microbial dynamics and succession between different production stagesVariable bacterial counts were observed during the pro- gression from first to third break and between each of the five rooms sampled.

Low counts of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and the absence of Gram-negative bacteria were similarly described byTable 1 Bacterial yeast fungal and thermotolerant coliform counts on fresh white button mushroomsMicrobial counts log CFU per g mean - standard deviation Farm 1Farm 2Production phaseProduction cycle BreakBacteriaThermotolerantcoliformsYeastsFungiBacteriaThermotolerant coliforms YeastsFungiRoom 1Preharvest1st2-5 - 2-7 G2-5 - 0-3 EFGH1-0 - 1-9 G1-7 - 1-1 BC5-6 - 0-7 ABCDE2-7 - 0-3 DEFG3-5 - 0-5 ABCD ND2nd4-9 - 0-2 DEF2-8 - 0-3 CDEFG 1-8 - 1-1 FG1-6 - 0-9 BCD 6-2 - 0-6 A2-8 - 0-3 DEFG4-1 - 0-5 AND3rd5-4 - 0-3 ABCDEF 2-9 - 0-2 CDEF4-0 - 0-4 AB1-8 - 0-3 B5-9 - 0-5 AB2-8 - 0-2 CDEFG3-3 - 1-4 ABCD NDPostpackaging1st4-7 - 1-9 F2-6 - 0-2 DEFG2-9 - 2-4 CDEF0-4 - 0-8 EF5-7 - 0-8 ABCD2-4 - 0-6 GHI3-8 - 0-6 ABCND2nd4-8 - 0-3 EF2-7 - 0-2 DEFG2-5 - 1-4 DEF1-9 - 0-8 B5-6 - 0-4 ABCDEF 2-8 - 0-4 DEFG3-6 - 0-6 ABCND3rd4-9 - 0-3 CDEF2-8 - 0-2 CDEFG 3-2 - 0-6 ABCD 1-7 - 0-2 B5-5 - 2-3 ABCDEF 3-0 - 0-5 CDE3-9 - 0-6 ABNDRoom 2 PreharvestPostpackagingTotal average microbial load 8-7 - 0-1 log CFU per gTotal microbial load range min-max 5-2-12-4 log CFU per gND not detected counts below detection limit.For each column mean values followed by statistical t-grouping according to analysis with a two-way ANOVA showing interaction effect between farms preharvest postpackaging rooms and production cycles breaks.

First break bacterial counts ranged from 5-4 to 6-2 log CFU per g for preharvest and 5-6 to 6-1 log CFU per g packaged mushrooms.

Bacterial counts during second break fluctuated between 5-7 and 6-0 log CFU per g for preharvest and 5-7 to 6-2 log CFU per g for packaged mushrooms.

Third break bacterial counts ranged from 5-6 to 6-1 log CFU per g for preharvest mushrooms and 5-9 to 6-1 log CFU per g for packaged mushrooms.

First break yeast counts were found to be in the range of 2-8 to 3-9 log CFU per g for preharvest and 2-9 to 4-0 log CFU per g for packaged mushrooms Table 1.

During the sec- ond break yeast counts showed a range varying from 2-3 to 3-9 log CFU per g for preharvest mushrooms and 3-5 to 3-9 log CFU per g for packaged mushrooms.

Third break yeast counts ranged from 2-3 to 4-2 log CFU per g for preharvest mushrooms and 3-6 to 4-2 log CFU per g for packaged mushrooms.
