Knowledge that BALBc and C57BL6 mice differ in polyreactive IgA abundance which impacts the generation of antigen-specific IgA and microbiota diversity provides indirect evidence that genetic influence on host - microbiota interactions may have implications for the gut microbiota impact on osteoimmunology.While Sjogren et al.reported the normal gut microbiota increases osteoclast numbers in growing Conv vs. GF mice the current study has elucidated the commensal gut microbiota pro-catabolic effects on bone remod- eling in the adult skeleton are secondary to immunomodulatory actions enhancing osteoclast sizematuration.

The realization that resident gut microbes induce sustained alterations in the adaptive-immune response in draining LLNs but not MLNs of SPF mice supports the authors' postulate that the commensal gut microbiota has osteoimmunomodulatory actions mediated through a previously unidentified Gut-Liver-Bone Axis.GF mice colonization with SPF mice gut microbiota normalizes osteoimmunomodulatory out- comes.

As opposed to prior investigations of the normal gut microbiota's impact on physiological skeletal growth-and pathophysiological skeletal deterioration- this report is the first to delineate the commensal gut microbiota's osteoimmunomodu- latory effects on both osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis in the remodeling healthy adult skeleton.Earlier investigations of the normal gut microbiota's influence on skeletal physiology in growing GF mouse models are essentially different than the current investigation of the normal gut microbiota's impact on bone remodeling in young adult GF mice.

Kirkwood12Despite knowledge the gut microbiota regulates bone mass mechanisms governing the normal gut microbiota's osteoimmunomodulatory effects on skeletal remodeling and homeostasis are unclear in the healthy adult skeleton.Young adult specific-pathogen-free and germ-free mice were used to delineate the commensal microbiota's immunoregulatory effects on osteoblastogenesis osteoclastogenesis marrow T-cell hematopoiesis and extra-skeletal endocrine organ function.We report the commensal microbiota has anti-anabolic effects suppressing osteoblastogenesis and pro-catabolic effects enhancing osteoclastogenesis which drive bone loss in health.

Conventionalized ConvD mice were generated by microbially associating 8 week-old GF C57BL6 littermate mice with gut microbiota from age matched SPF C57BL6 littermate mice Fig.

Considering that prior investigations of mice on the BALBc background have reported the gut microbiota enhances skeletal growth via upregulating liver derived IGF1  current study findings demonstrating that resident gut microbes suppress skeletal tissue derived IGF1 in C57BL6 mice highlights IGF1 as a potential genetic determinant modulating the gut microbiota's osteo- immunomodulatory effects.

a Conventionalization study timeline Conventionalized ConvD mice were generated by transferring 8 week- old male GF C57BL6 littermate mice from sterile isolator housing to ventilated cages in a SPF vivarium.Microbial association was performed via fecal inoculum derived from pooled fresh feces of age matched male SPF C57BL6 littermate mice which were housed in the same SPF vivarium.
