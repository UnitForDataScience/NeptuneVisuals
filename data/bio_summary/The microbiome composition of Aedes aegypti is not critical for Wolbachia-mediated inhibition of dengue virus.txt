RESEARCH ARTICLEThe microbiome composition of Aedes aegypti is not critical for Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of dengue virusMichelle D. Audsley Yixin H. Ye Elizabeth A. McGrawSchool of Biological Sciences Monash University Clayton VIC Melbourne AustraliaAbstractBackground Dengue virus DENV is primarily vectored by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and is estimatedto cause 390 million human infections annually.

aegypti by antibiotic treatment does not significantly impact blocking of DENVTo ascertain the effect of microbiome manipulation on DENV infection rates we measured DENV genome copies in individual mosquitoes by qRT-PCR.

aegypti with penicillin-streptomycin-kanamycin alters the microbiome composition without affecting relative abundance of WolbachiaTo examine the role of the native microbiome in wMel-mediated inhibition of DENV in Ae.

In spite of a significant shift in the microbiome composition in response to the antibiotics we detected no effect of antibiotic treatment on DENV infection rates or on the DENV load of infected mosquitoes.ConclusionsSignificanceOur findings indicate that stable infection with Wolbachia strain wMel produces few effects on the microbiome of laboratory-reared Ae.

Our findings suggest that the microbiome will be largely robust to Wolbachia infection and that at least for the spe- cies manipulated here there is no evidence that 'third parties' are a critical factor in the expres- sion of Wolbachia-mediated DENV blocking.Infection rate and DENV genome copy number are unaffected by manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotic treatment.

Individual bodies were stored in sterile 0.1 ml 1 x PBS homogenised using sterile 3 mm glass beads in a mechanical homogenizer and stored at- 80C until processing for genomic DNA gDNA extraction and DENV detection.Quantitative DENV RT-PCR analysisFor detection of DENV genome copies one tenth of the volume of the homogenised sample was removed and added to an extraction buffer solution 10 mM Tris pH 8.2 1 mM EDTA 50 mM NaCl and proteinase K  in a 11 ratio.

aegypti to examine the effect of stable infection by Wolbachia and the potential role of the microbiome in Wolbachia-medi- ated DENV blocking.

We found that Wolbachia has few effects on the microbiome and that even significant changes to the microbiome caused by our artificial manipulation had no effect on DENV susceptibility in these mosquitoes.
