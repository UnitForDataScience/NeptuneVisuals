notably there have been no reports of subclass i lantibiotic production by atcc 10712 despite an in-depth investigation into the strain's lantipeptide producing capability  and bagel3 identified no other lantibiotic-related genes in the area of interest leading us to determine that this was a false positive.the newly developed lanb profile hmm correctly identified the lanb protein in all nine positive controls while the pf04738 profile hmm correctly identified the lanb protein in eight of the nine positive controls failing to detect the bsa-associated lanb protein in staphylococcus aureus subsp.

positive and negative controls listed in  were used to evaluate the model's ability to 1 accurately identify lanb protein sequences and 2 distinguish lanb protein sequences from other related lantibiotic modification proteins i.e.

the throat metagenomes had the lowest lanb density and exhibited significantly lower densities than saliva p  0.0287 subgingival plaque p  0.009 supragingival plaque p  0.0016 and tongue dorsum p  0.0031 subsites'.manual examination of selected gene neighbourhoodssixty hits listed in  were randomly selected from those identified by the new profile hmm 45 2760 of which were identified by at least one of the other two methods and manually examined to determine if a bacteriocin gene cluster could be identified.

a flowchart of the steps involved in building validating and applying a profile hmm is depicted in .target sequence translationthe hmmer3 hmmsearch tool only accepts protein sequences as targets for comparison to protein profile hmms so a python script was created to translate the nucleotide sequences into protein sequences.

a total of 29 of these 50 were part of clusters whose components showed relatively low sequence identity39-50 with proteins responsible for the biosynthesis of thiopeptides and lantibiotics including a putative lanthionine dehydratase a radical samspasm domain-containing protein a thiopeptide-type bacteriocin biosynthesis domain-containing protein an s41 family peptidase and a protein of unknown function duf4932 predicted to be a putative metalloprotease.

while the pf04738 model relates to the c-terminus of the lanthionine dehydratase protein responsible for the glutamate elimination step of lantibiotic modification  the newly developed profile hmm takes the full length of the lanb protein into consideration thereby providing greater predictive power.

a significance cutoff of e  1 x 10-5 was chosen for both profile hmm and blastp methods.manual examination of randomly selected gene neighbourhoodsa subset of sixty hits were randomly selected and the surrounding region examined to identify other proteins involved in lantibiotic biosynthesis.

a total of 835 bacterial refseq protein sequences annotated as ''lantibiotic dehydratase'' were downloaded from ncbi protein website 13 apr 2015 in fasta format listed in .building and validating the new profile hidden markov modela global multiple sequence alignment was generated in the aligned-fasta format using muscle v3.8.31  and a profile hmm was built from the msa aligned-fasta file using the hmmer tool hmmbuild v3.1b1 may 2013. for comparison of the new model's performance hmmer3's hmmsearch tool was used with default parameters to search the pfam lantibiotic dehydratase model pf04738 against the same stool and oral hmasm assemblies the sequences used to build this model are listed in .

both the lanb and pf04738 profile hmms returned no false positives when searched against the seven negative controls used in this study.the web version of bagel3 correctly identified the lantibiotic modification proteins in all positive and negative controls excepting the aforementioned atcc 10712-encoded lanb concluded to be a false positive.

lactis kf147.metagenomic screena search with the newly developed profile hmm against the hmasm database identified 399 hits from the stool metagenomes and 1169 hits from the oral metagenomes.

the results of this comparison are summarised in and show that the newly developed profile hmm identified the greatest number of lantibiotic modification genes in datasets from both body sites while the blastp approach identified the fewest.the overall results of these combined screening approaches illustrated in and summarised in  show a higher number and density of hits in the oral metagenomes than in the stool metagenomes wilcoxon rank sum test p  1.399e-05 and they also reveal a large variation in density of hits between the different sites within the oral metagenomes.
