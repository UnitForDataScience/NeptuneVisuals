Notably there have been no reports of subclass I lantibiotic production by ATCC 10712 despite an in-depth investigation into the strain's lantipeptide producing capability  and BAGEL3 identified no other lantibiotic-related genes in the area of interest leading us to determine that this was a false positive.The newly developed LanB profile HMM correctly identified the LanB protein in all nine positive controls while the PF04738 profile HMM correctly identified the LanB protein in eight of the nine positive controls failing to detect the Bsa-associated LanB protein in Staphylococcus aureus subsp.

The throat metagenomes had the lowest LanB density and exhibited significantly lower densities than Saliva p  0.0287 Subgingival Plaque p  0.009 Supragingival Plaque p  0.0016 and Tongue Dorsum p  0.0031 subsites'.Manual examination of selected gene neighbourhoodsSixty hits listed in  were randomly selected from those identified by the new profile HMM 45 2760 of which were identified by at least one of the other two methods and manually examined to determine if a bacteriocin gene cluster could be identified.

The results of this comparison are summarised in and show that the newly developed profile HMM identified the greatest number of lantibiotic modification genes in datasets from both body sites while the BlastP approach identified the fewest.The overall results of these combined screening approaches illustrated in and summarised in  show a higher number and density of hits in the oral metagenomes than in the stool metagenomes Wilcoxon rank sum test p  1.399e-05 and they also reveal a large variation in density of hits between the different sites within the oral metagenomes.

Taxonomic classification of these LanB-encoding contigs also served to highlight patterns in the results of the three approaches used  for example our model identified Allokutzneria Coprococcus Enterovibrio Paenibacillus and Tenicibaculum-encoded LanB proteins that were completely missed by the Pfram and BlastP approaches.CONCLUSIONSAcross the oral and stool communities examined this study identified 2007 unique putative subclass I lantibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters by three different methods further emphasising the tremendous potential that the human microbiota has as a source of therapeutic compounds.

Both the LanB and PF04738 profile HMMs returned no false positives when searched against the seven negative controls used in this study.The web version of BAGEL3 correctly identified the lantibiotic modification proteins in all positive and negative controls excepting the aforementioned ATCC 10712-encoded LanB concluded to be a false positive.

A significance cutoff of E  1 x 10-5 was chosen for both profile HMM and BlastP methods.Manual examination of randomly selected gene neighbourhoodsA subset of sixty hits were randomly selected and the surrounding region examined to identify other proteins involved in lantibiotic biosynthesis.

lactis KF147.Metagenomic screenA search with the newly developed profile HMM against the HMASM database identified 399 hits from the stool metagenomes and 1169 hits from the oral metagenomes.

A possible explanation for this significantly lower gene density Welch's two sample t -test p  1.232e - 10 is that the subclass I lantibiotic clusters identified in the metagenomic data by the new profile HMM are present in the genomes of rarer members of the gut microbiota which are not represented in the HMP reference genome database.AccessionStrainE ValueTaxonomic classification of LanB-encoding contigsThe MEM run mode of Kaiju works by searching for exact matches of given length between the query and database sequences in the case of multiple hits of the same length in different taxa a lowest common ancestor is inferred.

Positive and negative controls listed in  were used to evaluate the model's ability to 1 accurately identify LanB protein sequences and 2 distinguish LanB protein sequences from other related lantibiotic modification proteins i.e.

The DNA nucleotide sequences were translated in six frames using the standard genetic code.Metagenomic screenThe HMMER3 tool hmmsearch was used with default parameters to search both the new LanB profile HMM and the Pfam PF04738 profile HMM  against the stool and oral subsets of the Human Microbiome Project's whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing assemblies HMASM.
