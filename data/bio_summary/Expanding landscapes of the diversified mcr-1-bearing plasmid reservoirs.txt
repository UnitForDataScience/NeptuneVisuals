Intriguingly the modifica- tions of lipid A with both GalN and pEtN account for colistin resistance in the serious opportunistic pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii A. baumannii  Add- itionally the PmrAPmrB two-component system is also implicated into genetic control of lipid A modification as well as polymyxin resistance in Salmonella enterica S. enterica  A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa Thus we anticipated that enteric pathogens have devel- oped multiple mechanisms to remodel its lipid A struc- tureintegrity on the LPS under dynamic selection by the altered environments like antibiotic exposures.The emergence of the mobilized colistin resistance gene mcr-1 illustrated a new mechanism for plasmid- borne polymyxin resistance The protein product of mcr-1 referred to MCR-1 is annotated as an integral membrane protein with five trans-membrane helices Our genetic experiment proved that localization of the MCR-1 in bacterial peri-plasm is critical for its role in colistin resistance through deleting the trans-membrane region Together with catalytic structures of MCR-1 reported by three other research groups - our structure-guided functional studies revealed the require- ment of a five-residue-containing motif for its biochem- ical function Since its first discovery in Southern China in the late of 2015 the mcr-1 gene have been detected in nearly 40 countries from five of seven conti- nents  The mcr-1-positive gut bacteria included Escherichia coli E. coli  S. enterica K.pneumoniae Enterobacter aerogenes E. aero- genes  Kluyvera ascorbata Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter braakii Not only does the mcr-1 gene appear in diversified E. coli isolates with different sequence types but also it coexists with the NDM-1 and its variants like NDM-5 and NDM-9 Additionally ESBL can be coproduced with MCR-1 from a single plasmid or a same bacterial isolate -Further sequence analyses showed that the mcr-1-harboring plasmid reservoirsexhibit an unexpected diversity - Multiple lines of replication incompatibility have been assigned to these mcr-1-bearing plasmids which included IncP IncI2  IncX1-X2 mosaic version IncX3-X4 hybrid type IncX4 IncHI2  IncFI  IncFII andIncHI1 respectively.

First it was estimated that no less than three isolates GD46 GD65 and WH03 car- ries the mcr-1-positive plasmid of 33 kb long Additional file Figure S1B and D. Second the mcr-1 gene is located on 60 kb plasmid in seven isolates Additional file Figure S1B and D. Third two big mcr-1-harboring plasmids 120 kb for pGD17-2 and 240 kb for pGD80-2 separately occurred in the strains GD17-2 and GD80-2 Additional file Figure S1B and D. Although we failed to detect mcr-1-positive band in the strain Lishui12 using Southern blot Additional file Figure S1B we proved that it is PCR-positive for mcr-1 and had a success in iso- lating a mcr-1-producing plasmid pLishui12 of 33 kb long Additional file Figure S4.

In this follow-up study 13 representative mcr-1-positive plasmids Additional file Table S1 were subjected to further genetic analyses of both S1-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis PFGE Additional file Figure S1A and C and Southern hybridization blot Additional file Figure S1B and D. As expected diversified plasmids were present in the above 13 E. coli isolates Additional file Figure S1.

Although this type of plasmids lacks the insertion sequence ISApl1 Additional file Figure S2 they consistently share a site-specific recombin- ase rci gene two pilus-encoding genes pil and tra and four different pilli proteins Additional file  Figure S2.

Therefore the discovery of these plasmids significantly contributedTable 1 Colistin MIC of clinical E. coli strains expressing mcr-1to a growing collection of mcr-1-positive plasmids with known replicon sequences Additional file Table S3.Briefly in similarity to the newly identified plasmid pLishui142-1 61.908 kb seven additional new members of IncI2-type mcr-1-bearing plasmids were determined in this study which corresponded to pGD23-3 64.078 kb pGD53-3 62.813 kb pGD65-3 64.857 kb pGD81-1 62.712 kb pWH07-3 62.067 kb pWH09-362.072 kb and pWH13-4 60.694 kb respectively Additional file  Table S1.

All the four IncX4 plas- mids are featuring the almost identical genetic back- bone in which no ISApl1 element is flanked by the only antibiotic resistance gene mcr-1 gene Additional file Figures S4 S5 and S7.

Thus the hybrid plasmid pGD17-2 represents a novel mobile element carrying mcr-1 and provides remarkable insights into the plasmid-mediated transfer of MCR-1 colistin resistance.In the mcr-1-harboring IncX4 plasmids pGD46-3 pGD65-4 Lishui12 and pWH03 the regions between parA gene and repA gene are nearly identical Additional file Figure S7B in that they shared 99 similarity to IncX4 mcr-1-harboring K. pneumoniae plas- mid pMCR1IncX4 Accession no.

colistin resistance - Biochemical mech- anism by which bacteria acquire the appreciable resistance to colistin is mainly dependent on the reduc- tion in the net negative charge of the bacterial outer- membrane which consequently decreases the binding affinity of colistin to bacterial surface -To the best of our knowledge four types of modifications of the lipid A moiety anchored on bacterial lipid polysaccharide LPS are involved in the alteration of the net negative surface charge which include i modification at 3'- linked second fatty acyl chain with glycine andorc The Authors.
