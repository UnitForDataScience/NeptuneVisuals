The former mice showed no preference between the chamber with the stranger mouse 2 46.27 - 6.7 s and the chamber with the familiar mouse 1 49.6 - 9 s whereas the latter spent more time with mouse 2 41.6 - 3.6 s compared to mouse 1 17.4 - 1.6 s II ses- sion E. The treatment with probiotic in Dysb mice increased the time spent in the chamber with the mouse 2 33 - 3.7 s which proved significantly higher compared with the time spent in the chamber containing the mouse 1 15.3 - 0.9 s p  0.001 in the second session of the three-chamber sociability paradigm E. Vehicle-treated Dysb mice showed no difference in the time spent in the two chambers 35 - 3.4 s vs 27.2 - 2 s respec- tively E. Probiotic treatment did not induce any change per se F-G. Dysb animals subjected to recovery with no treatment showed a physiological re-establishment of normal behaviour about 2 weeks after discontinuation of the antibiotic treatment C.

Stacked bar-chart showing microbiota composition at family level.Effects of antibiotic-induced microbiota perturbation on cognitive and nociceptive behavioursPerturbation of gut microbiota did not affect cognitive perfor- mance in the object recognition task since Dysb mice did not show a different recognition index 60.4 - 9.5 compared with control mice 54.3 - 8.5 H. Moreover Dysb mice did not show any difference in percentage of alternation in arm entries 62.2 - 3.7 compared with controls 59.0 - 3.0 in the y-maze I. Additionally thermal threshold in the hot plate test was not different in Dysb mice 8.7 - 1.2 s compared with controls 7.9 - 0.7 s J.Probiotic treatment normalizes altered hippocampal BDNF expression caused by antibiotic-induced microbiota perturbationTo investigate possible changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF regulation we analyzed the levels of expression of BDNF and its conjugate tropomyosin receptor kinase B TrkB in the hippocampus of Dysb and control mice with or without probi- otic treatment.

The treat- ment with probiotic normalised BDNF protein expression but did not affect TrkB expression compared with vehicle-treated Dysb mice F and G.Antibiotic treatment induces changes in the gut microbiotaAs expected antibiotic treatment induced dramatic changes in the overall gut microbiota composition as assessed by MANOVA p  0.05 and Dysb mice clearly clustered apart from all the other groups Suppl.

A simpli- fied scheme of treatments in control and Dysb mice is given in A. Dysbiotic Dysb mice showed increased immobility time126.2 - 6 s compared with control mice 61.5 - 8.9 s p  0.001 F3 29  26.515 recorded as the absence of escape-oriented behaviour in the tail suspension test B.

Repeated probiotic administration in Dysb mice significantly reduced their time of immobility in the tail suspension test 46.5 - 7.3 s compared with the group receiving vehicle 119.7 - 10.3 s p  0.001 F3 29  26.515 B. Immobilitytime was also reduced in treated Dysb mice 24.0 - 5.22 s com- pared with the related control 80 - 13.9 s p  0.001 F3 28 17.398 in the forced swimming test.

In the latter test vehicle- treated Dysb mice showed a slight trend to recovery compared to Dysb mice B.

The probiotic treatment was effective at reversing only the iNOS increase p  0.05.In the ileum IL-1b expression did not show statistically signif- icant changes in Dysb mice with or without vehicle or probiotic treatment Suppl.

Dysb mice did not show any significant changes in the ongoing activity M and P the duration or onset of inhibition 2.21 - 0.17 spikess 2.64 - 0.15 s and 1273 - 58.86 ms respectively Q and R. Moreover we did not observe any sig- nificant difference in the values of EAP amplitude or EAP slope in Dysb mice as compared to controls N and O.
