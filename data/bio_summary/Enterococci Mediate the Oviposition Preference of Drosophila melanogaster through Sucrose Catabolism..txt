For food fermentation the total 108 CFU of bacteria were suspended in sterile 1x PBS and seeded onto fly food plates.

Since bacteria dominate fly food and metabolize sucrose during fermentation we further examined sucrose content and bacteria population in the media over time.

Our hypotheses is that the following process 1 bacteria readily grow on overripe fruit 2 bacteria metabolize sugar and reduce the concentration of sucrose in rotting fruit 3 flies seek favorable sites for egg laying by activating sucrose receptors 4 flies navigate to low-sugar sites that are linked with a rich source of bacteria and lay eggs 5 fermenting bacteria promote the development of larvae.

To this end we developed a system of fly food fermentation with bacteria Fig.

Sucrose was added to fermented fly food EF  Sucrose and the oviposition preference of EF  sucrose food was compared to fermented food H2O.

Acarbose was added to fermented fly food EF  acarbose and the oviposition preference of EF  acarbose food was compared to fermented food H2O.

Food fermentation processes change food tastes as well as volatile odors which are both used to assess the nutritional quality of food by animals.

Interestingly flies given no choice but to lay eggs on the whole-forced cage laid 4.5-fold more eggs on fermented food compared to control food Fig.

Indeed most dominant bacteria belonging to LAB and acetic acid bacteria are well-known fermentative bacteria that convert many sugars to acids gases or alcohol.

The predicted functions of rotting fruit-associated bacteria were also in lines with the ones of fermented fly food Fig.
