a plot of the pca scores showed that the gut microbiome of the aad  slbzs group represented a slight structural shift along pc2 with a similar trend as in the nc group whereas the aad group demonstrated a marked shift along pc1 compared with the nc group a. both unweighted and weighted unifrac analyses showed comparable changes in the gut microbiome in the nc and aad  slbzs groups with a greater distinction in segregation by weighted unifrac anal- ysis compared with the unweighted analysis b c.key phylotypes of gut microbiome modulated by slbzs treatment in rats with aadtaxon-based analysis revealed marked changes in the gut microbial composition in response to both aad and slbzs treat- ment.

in conclusion changes in the gut microbiome are associated with the diarrhea-controlling effect of slbzs.c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.introductionwith the widespread use of antibiotics in the treatment of numerous infectious diseases the available evidence indicates not only suppression of infection but also potential clinical complica- tions due to the misuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms poor compli- ance and increasing rates of disease related to antibiotic use aad is one of the most common antibiotics-related complications in patients in which altered gut microbiome was observed the dynamic gut microbiome play a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis and host health a healthy gut microbiome is thought to impact host physiology and health status by limiting col- onization of pathogens whereas changes in microbial communitiesabbreviations aad antibiotic-associated diarrhea slbzs shen ling bai zhu san tcm traditional chinese medicine spf specific pathogen-free nc normal control group nast nearest alignment space termination otu operational taxo- nomic unit pcoa principal coordinate analysis.

in particular the gut microbiome in the aad group demonstrated significant reduction in both richness and diversity compared with the gut microbiome in the nc group and the slbzs treatment group c d.unsupervised multivariate statistical methods including pca and unifrac distance-based pcoa were used to analyze the over- all structural changes in the gut microbiota.

however it is not clear whether the gut microbiome variations were the causes or consequences of the drug treatments.we found that slbzs treatment was able to shift the gut micro- biota structure which had enhancing effects on the microbial richness and diversity in the gut of rats with aad.

however a direct gut microbial comparison of aad and aad  slbzs samples would help to understand the role of the gut microbiome in the efficacy of slbzs against diarrhea.in conclusion our study suggests that the chinese herbal for- mula slbzs demonstrated an effect in shifting the gut microbiome structure during the treatment of rats with aad.

these observation demon- strated the successful establishment of the rat diarrhea model.the diarrhea rates of the rats with aad following slbzs treat- ment are illustrated in at all time points after the slbzs treatment the diarrhea rates were significantly lower than those in the untreated model group and after 7 days of treatment with slbzs the diarrhea rate was reduced to only 5.overall structural modulation of gut microbiome after slbzs treatmentto examine the effect of slbzs on the gut microbiome structure in the rat diarrhea model an illumina hiseq 2000 sequencing sys- tem was used to generate 1226382 high-quality sequences from 30 fecal samples.

after a week acclima- tion period 30 rats were randomly assigned into three groups 10group normal control group nc antibiotic-associated diar- rhea group aad and slbzs treatment group aad  slbzs.

from days 3-7 the rats in the untreated model group and the treatment group maintained 100 diarrhea whereas in the nc group no clinical symptoms of diarrhea were observed.

although how slbzs-mediated changes in the gut microbiota contribute to the improvement of diarrhea need to be further investigated our preclinical study provides evidence that gut microbiome change is a feature of slbzs treatment.author contributionsconceived and designed the experiments d s s g. performed the experiments w.l.

in aad  slbzs group the pathological change was significantly reduced.discussionin this study all aad model rats demonstrated clinical symp- toms of diarrhea which is in agreement with previous individualstudies of aad the gut microbiota analysis revealed a sig- nificant reduction in richness and diversity in rats with aad indicating that the aad model was successfully established in this study.

the aad and aad  slbzs rats were administrated by gastric gavage with lincomycin hydrochloride 2 ml 1.2 g twice a day for one week eight hours at a time while the nc group was administered with equal volume of physiological saline.after one week the aad  slbzs group underwent gastric gav- age with slbzs 2 ml 1.2 g twice per day for one week eight hours at a time and the other two groups were orally administered an equal volume of physiological saline.

to determine whether the traditional chinese herbal formula of shen ling bai zhu san slbzs modulates the composition of the gut microbiome during aad treatment an aad diar- rhea model was prepared in rats by gastric gavage with lincomycin for 7 successive days followed by administration of slbzs for one week.
