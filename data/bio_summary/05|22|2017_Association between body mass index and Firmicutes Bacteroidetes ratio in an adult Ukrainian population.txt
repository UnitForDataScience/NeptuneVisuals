The DNA quantity and quality was measured by NanoDrop ND-8000 Thermo Scientific USA.

The primer sequences wereBacteroidetes798cfbF AAACTCAAAKGAATTGACGG Forward.

The PCR reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 95 degC 30 cycles of 95 degC for 15 s annealing for 15 s and 72 degC for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72 degC for 5 min.

The Cts univ and spec were the threshold cycles registered by the thermocycler.

The aver- age Ct value obtained from each pair was transformed into percentage with the formula .Identification of microbial compositionDetermination of microbial composition at the level of major microbial phyla was carried out by identification of total bacterial DNA and DNA of Bacteroidetes Fir- micutes and Actinobacteria was performed with quanti- tative real-time PCR qRT-PCR using gene-targeted primers.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using the software STATISTICA 11.0.

The relative abundance of Actinobacteria was small 5-7 and comparable in different BMI categories.

The content of Firmicutes was gradually increased while the content of Bacteroidetes was decreased with increasing BMI the FB ratio also raised with increas- ing BMI Table Figs.
