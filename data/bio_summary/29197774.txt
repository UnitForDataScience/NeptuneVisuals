It has been suggested that the mechanism for the SAO process occurs by the reversion of the Wood Ljungdahl WL pathway which is rather widespread in several bacterial and archaeal acetogenic species .The relevance of specific biochemical pathways in a well-adaptedAD microbiome is related to the abundance and activity of certain species harbouring these pathways.

Gene annotation and association to relevant metabolic pathways indicated that the phyla Chloroflexi and Bacteroidales might encompass new currently undescribed SAOBformate producing species that would metabolize acetate via the glycine cleavage system.

This novel approach facilitated the functional analysis of genes in relation to ammonia ex- posure the reconstruction of probable metabolic pathways for metha- nogenesis and acetate assimilation and the identification of novel species that might be involved in the SAO process.Materials and methodsBiogas plants and sampling procedureThe present study was performed on four full-scale anaerobic di- gesters designed as continuous stirred tank reactors CSTR and oper- ated under mesophilic conditions .

Furthermore it has recently been proposed that some species from the Thermotogae phylum have the ability to syntrophically degrade acetate despite the fact that their WL pathway appears to be truncated .

Representatives of Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi might harbour novel SAOBformate producing species that metabolize acetate via the glycine cleavage system.

Alternatively the acetate excess can be metabolized to hy- drogen and carbon dioxide via the so-called syntrophic acetate oxida- tion pathway SAO .

Metagenome descriptions yielded 73 assembled population genomes of which only 7 could be as- signed at the species level.

This approach targets one or two hypervariable regions of ri- bosomal genes for phylogenetic affiliation and therefore inference of functional traits is limited to those species that have previously been described.

Hence only an approximate description of the microbiome function can be obtained based on the known ecophysiology of the identified species.
