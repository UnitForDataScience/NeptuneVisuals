changed dramatically in cirrhotic patients In a study that assessed the fecal Lactobacilli population low diversity index was found in patients with hepatitis B virus HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis During liver transplantation the gut barrier can be ravaged and gut microbiota can be impeded in hepatic IRReceived February 6 2017 accepted June 2 2017 Correspondence or AR injuries Thus significant alteration of abundant intestinal bacteria exists causing severe infectionTherefore the appropriate control and prevention of specific infections instituting a gut microbial balance should be applied.

Moreover among the six major microorganisms that were studied the excessive growth of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus significantly dominated the gut microbial structure shifts Damage to the intestinal barrierUnder physiological conditions the gastrointestinal sys- tem not only digests and absorbs foods but also functions as a defensive barrier However intestinal barrier dysfunction can be widely seen not only in the rats with OLT bearing IR injury or AR injury but also in rats with preoperative malnutrition which is very common in chronic hepatic disease patients Different degrees of intestinal barrier damage can be seen as followsmotility weakening structure impairment and the secre- tion reduction that may damage the physical barrier Moreover microbial dysbiosis and juiceless digestive secretion damage the chemical and biological barriers Shrinkage of the intestine-related lymphoid tissue and a decrease in the gut secretion of sIgA abate the immune barrier Thus protection of the intestinal barrier utilizing microbial balance is important.ManagementAmeliorating IR injuryA significant number of studies have shown the possible mechanism of IR injury However only a handful of studies have concentrated on the vital role of intestinal microbiota.A study showed that the use of probiotics such as Bifidobacterium catenulatum ZYB0401 plus Lactobacillus fermentum ZYL0401 can prevent hepatic IR injury in rats by modifying the gut microflora ameliorating the intestinal mucous barrier suppressing the possibility of bacterial transplantation and plasma endotoxin levels and amelior- ating hepatic lipid peroxidation.

The aim is not only to predict perioperative injuries but also to function as a method of treatment or even inhibit the rejection of liver transplantation.Keywords gut microbial balance liver transplantation ischemia-reperfusion acute rejectionIntroductionDuring the last few decades orthotopic liver transplanta- tion OLT has been used as conventional therapy for nonreversible acute and chronic liver diseases The number of patients undergoing OLT has increased dramatically and the success rate of such operations has improved steadily However perioperative injuries caused by ischemia-reperfusion IR or acute rejection AR still hinder the survival rate.Currently intestinal microbiota is identified as an extremely important microecosystem and is even consid- ered as a main metabolic organ that maintains a symbiotic relationship with the body - Between 10 and 100 trillion microbes are considered to live in the human gastrointestinal tract Their importance in resisting pathogenic microbes -1 regulating metabolic processes functioning as a neglected endocrine organ and inducing the maturation of the immunesystem have been demonstrated Nevertheless intestinal microbiota has been related to a variety of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease hepatosis cardiovascular diseases  obesity  diabetes colorectal cancer and nervous system diseases The status of health or disease is related to the closely linked anatomies and functions of the intestine and liver.

In addition we propose possible directions for research on gut microbial alteration during liver transplantation and offer a hypothesis on the utilization of microbial alteration in liver transplantation.

Therefore the author speculated that the function of a hepatic graft can be enhanced by liver IPC during liver transplantation through the restoration of the gut microbial balance and even positive feedback of the gut-liver axis.Reducing AR injuryAlthough an alteration of the intestinal microbiota was observed in rats with AR injury after OLT few studies have been dedicated to the mechanisms or the treatment of AR injury utilizing microbial balance.

According to current findings the majority of intestinal microbiota autochthonous groups such as the Bifidobac- terium and the Bacteroides fragilis subgroup of a healthy host presents host-specific relative stability over time within each individual whereas the total bacteria of gut microbiota such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium spp.

Thus the author provided another method for the protection of intestinal barrier by the supplementa- tion of glycyl-glutamine.PredictionIn the past only 10-30 of gut microbiota can be detected by classical culturing techniques In recent years progressive molecular technologies such as next- generation sequencing technologies including 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic sequencing and PCRDGGE has benefited the measurement of intestinal microbiota and the sensibility of predicting perioperative injuries.With the application of natural-source glycogen measur- ing lactobacilli 16S rDNA extracted from fecal samples Wu et al.

This article reviews the research progress for gut microbial alterations and liver transplantation.

Especially this work also evaluates research on the management of gut microbial alteration and the prediction of possible injuries utilizing microbial alteration during liver transplantation.
