moreover among the six major microorganisms that were studied the excessive growth of bacteroides and ruminococcus significantly dominated the gut microbial structure shifts damage to the intestinal barrierunder physiological conditions the gastrointestinal sys- tem not only digests and absorbs foods but also functions as a defensive barrier however intestinal barrier dysfunction can be widely seen not only in the rats with olt bearing ir injury or ar injury but also in rats with preoperative malnutrition which is very common in chronic hepatic disease patients different degrees of intestinal barrier damage can be seen as followsmotility weakening structure impairment and the secre- tion reduction that may damage the physical barrier moreover microbial dysbiosis and juiceless digestive secretion damage the chemical and biological barriers shrinkage of the intestine-related lymphoid tissue and a decrease in the gut secretion of siga abate the immune barrier thus protection of the intestinal barrier utilizing microbial balance is important.managementameliorating ir injurya significant number of studies have shown the possible mechanism of ir injury however only a handful of studies have concentrated on the vital role of intestinal microbiota.a study showed that the use of probiotics such as bifidobacterium catenulatum zyb0401 plus lactobacillus fermentum zyl0401 can prevent hepatic ir injury in rats by modifying the gut microflora ameliorating the intestinal mucous barrier suppressing the possibility of bacterial transplantation and plasma endotoxin levels and amelior- ating hepatic lipid peroxidation.

in addition we propose possible directions for research on gut microbial alteration during liver transplantation and offer a hypothesis on the utilization of microbial alteration in liver transplantation.

especially this work also evaluates research on the management of gut microbial alteration and the prediction of possible injuries utilizing microbial alteration during liver transplantation.

therefore the author speculated that the function of a hepatic graft can be enhanced by liver ipc during liver transplantation through the restoration of the gut microbial balance and even positive feedback of the gut-liver axis.reducing ar injuryalthough an alteration of the intestinal microbiota was observed in rats with ar injury after olt few studies have been dedicated to the mechanisms or the treatment of ar injury utilizing microbial balance.

2. furthermore four key bands of microbial variation in ar injuries were explored providing a feasible auxiliary biomarker for the diagnosis of early ar after olt.conclusionsas a result of the progress in microbial detection technologies although perioperative injuries especially ir ar or subsequent intestinal barrier dysfunctions restrict the use of olt accurate mechanisms and the management of reducing injury through microbial balance are rapidly being revealed.

analyzed different parameters in rats with olt indicating that the gut microbial variation preceded barrier dysfunc- tion and that the intestinal microbial alteration was more sensitive than hepatic histology in predicting hepatic acute or chronic rejection injury after olt fig.

this article reviews the research progress for gut microbial alterations and liver transplantation.

the aim is not only to predict perioperative injuries but also to function as a method of treatment or even inhibit the rejection of liver transplantation.keywords gut microbial balance liver transplantation ischemia-reperfusion acute rejectionintroductionduring the last few decades orthotopic liver transplanta- tion olt has been used as conventional therapy for nonreversible acute and chronic liver diseases the number of patients undergoing olt has increased dramatically and the success rate of such operations has improved steadily however perioperative injuries caused by ischemia-reperfusion ir or acute rejection ar still hinder the survival rate.currently intestinal microbiota is identified as an extremely important microecosystem and is even consid- ered as a main metabolic organ that maintains a symbiotic relationship with the body - between 10 and 100 trillion microbes are considered to live in the human gastrointestinal tract their importance in resisting pathogenic microbes -1 regulating metabolic processes functioning as a neglected endocrine organ and inducing the maturation of the immunesystem have been demonstrated nevertheless intestinal microbiota has been related to a variety of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease hepatosis cardiovascular diseases  obesity  diabetes colorectal cancer and nervous system diseases the status of health or disease is related to the closely linked anatomies and functions of the intestine and liver.

thus microbial metabolites from patients with immune tolerance should be studied further to determine whether the product of the microbiota can induce immune tolerance after liver transplantation.nevertheless as one of the key methods for diagnosis in the future the veracity and the quantity of microbial biomarkers should be studied extensively.

thus cognizance of the intestinal microbial profile may predict injuries caused by the abuse of antibiotics.analyzing the peculiarity of the ileal microbiota in small bowel transplantation oh et al.

stated that microbial profiling may have the potential to become a biomarker in the diagnosis of small bowel transplantation rejection.

in a pilot study of kidney transplantation ar was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of proteobac- teria and a decrease in firmicutes in addition a study of stem cell transplant recipients revealed that the graft- versus-host disease can be predicted by the measurementof microbial alterations recently ren et al.
