Representative curves from n  3 biological replicates are shown and doubling times are reported as mean - s.d.OOH -acrylate4-OH Phe Phe IndolestandardsfldZWTExtended Data Figure 6  The fldZ mutant is defective in conversion of phenylacrylate and 4-OH-phenylacryalte.

Addition of glucose to the basal medium restored the growth characteristics of the mutant to wild-type levels  indicating that the fldC mutant suffers from impaired amino acid metabolism.

The first is to characterize the biological activities of these metabolites including their relevance to human disease.

The second is to identify the metabolic pathways responsible for their production which will enable the prediction of metabolic output directly from sequencingPrevious studies have shown that a small number of bacteria includ- ing C. sporogenes and Clostridium botulinum can produce IPA from tryptophan.

The most energetically demanding step in this pathway is the dehydration of phenyllactic acid to t-cinnamic acid catalysed by the heterotrimeric enzyme phenyllactate dehydratase FldABC.

The phenyllactate dehydratase genes are part of a 15-kb cluster in the C. sporogenes chromosome .
