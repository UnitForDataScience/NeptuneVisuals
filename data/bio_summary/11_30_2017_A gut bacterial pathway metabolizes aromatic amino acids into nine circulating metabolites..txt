addition of glucose to the basal medium restored the growth characteristics of the mutant to wild-type levels  indicating that the fldc mutant suffers from impaired amino acid metabolism.

similarly wild-type but not fldc mutant cells could convert the arylpyruvic acid and aryllactic acid to the correspond- ing arylpropionic acids suggesting that fldc acts downstream of the transamination and initial reduction steps.

levels of other metabo- lites upstream of the fldc blockade were significantly increased in mice colonized with the fldc mutant red arrows in .

liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec- trometry lc-msms analysis of the supernatants showed that ipa accumulated in the supernatant of wild-type c. sporogenes but not the fldc mutant .

similarly levels of ppa and 4-oh-ppa were high in wild-type supernatants but were very low or undetectable in the fldc mutant .

therefore to assess the metabolic blockade in the fldc mutant cell suspensions were prepared in which amino acids derived from the growth medium were washed away.

consistent with our findings in actively dividing cultures these three products were undetectable in the fldc mutant strain .

however the fldc mutant transformed phenylacrylate 4-oh-phenylacrylate and indoleacrylate the presumed dehydratase products to their corresponding propi- onic acids .
