the isolates included in the present study obtained from a great scallop hatchery in norway were undoubtedly assigned to n. phycophila on the basis of their 16s rrna gene sequence similarity indicating that this bacterial species presents a wider host and geographical distribution from the caribbean to the north sea.the scallop isolates and n. phycophila cect 8716t presented sev- eral differential characteristics as the temperature ph and salinity tol- erance among others.

chemotaxonomywhole-cell fatty acid analysis was concurrently performed on cells of five scallop isolates n. naphthovorans cect 7132t and n. phycophila cect 8716t grown for 3 days at 25degc on ma difco.

these results were slightly different to those given in n. phycophila description even though the conditions and growth medium were thetable 1 characteristics of five scallop isolates andneptunomonas phycophila cect 8716taaall strains were positive for the use of d-glucose fructose sucrose d-mannitol myo-inositol glycerol sodium acetate pyruvate l-serine d-alanine arginine ornithine propionic acid citric acid lactic acid succinic acid glutamic acid amino-n-butyric acid aspartic acid b-hydroxybutyric acid fumaric acid malic acid and d-saccharic acid and enzymatic activities of alkaline phosphatase and leucine arylamidase whereas they were all negative for d-xylose l-rhamnose maltose melibiose salicin amygdalin sorbitol n-acetyl-d-glucosamine glycine l-leucine lysine and threonine and the enzymatics activities of trypsin a-chymotrypsin a-galactosidase b-galactosidase a-glucosidase b-glucosidase b-glucuronidase n-acetyl- b-glucosaminidase a-mannosidase and a-fucosidase.bv indicates variable results.

type strains of neptunomonas naph- thovorans cect 7132t and n. phycophila cect 8716t were obtained from the coleccion espanola de cultivos tipo cect and included in the study for taxonomic comparison.

the ph growth range was 5-10 with the excep- tion of 3sh2.3 which presented a ph range of 5-8 but contrarily to cect 8716t they don't grow at ph 11. glucose was not fermented byscallop isolates unlike n. phycophila cect 8716t which was able to weakly ferment several carbohydrates table 1.norwegian isolates showed extreme uniformity within the utiliza- tion of different compounds as sole carbon sources.

type strain of n. phycophila cect 8716t showed different ability in the use of carbon sources being able to utilize d-ribose arabinose d-galactose trehalose d-mannose cello- biose lactose and l-histidine but not gluconic acid table 1.according to api zym alkaline phosphatase and leucine arylami- dase activity was present in all isolates including type strain cect 8716t andtrypsin a-chymotrypsin a-galactosidase b-galactosidase b-glucuronidase a-glucosidase b-glucosidase n-acetyl-b-gluco saminidase a-mannosidase and a-fucosidase activities were negative for all isolates.

our study also demonstrated that strains belonging to n. phycoph- ila as other representatives of the genus neptunomonas posses the genes necessary to degrade pah compounds opening an important field of research to properly characterize the degradative pathways in this bacterial species and to determine its potential biotechnological applications.acknowledgmentsthis work was supported in part by project 245119 reproseed from kbbe-2009-1-2-11 subprogramme of the 7th framework programme fp7 european commission and grant agl2013-42628-r aei feder ue from the agencia estatal de investigacion spain.conflict of interest all the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.references alikhan n. f. petty n. k. ben zakour n. l.  beatson s. a.

phenotypic characterizationthe five scallop isolates together with the type strains of n. phycophila and n. naphthovorans were characterized by routine phenotypic tests following the methodologies described by lemos toranzo and barja 1985 romalde toranzo and barja 1990 and macfaddin 1993. all media were supplemented with 1 nacl when required.

genome sequencing and annotation dna-dna relatedness average nucleotide identity and gc contentin addition dna of isolates 3cm2.5 and n. phycophila cect 8716t were extracted with a high pure pcr template preparation kitfigure 1 neighbor-joining tree based on 16s rrna gene sequence data showing the phylogenetic positions of strains within the genus neptunomonas.

the versions described in this paper are versions mrcj01000000 and mrci01000000 respectively.the average nucleotide identity ani using blast anib and mummer anim algorithms was calculated using the software j-species v1.2.1 as described by richter and rosello-mora 2009. orthoani percentages were calculated as described by lee kim park and chun 2015. in silico dna-dna hybridization ddh values were estimated between strains 3cm2.5 and n. phycophila cect 8716t using the genome-to-genome calculator ggdc2.0 auch klenk  goke 2010b auch von jan klenk  goker 2010a meier-kolthoffauch klenk  goker 2013. the gc mol content of the strains was determined from the whole genome sequencing data.

the range of growth at different temperature nacl concen- tration or ph observed for the scallop strains differed from those given for n. phycophila cect 8716t.

similar values were obtained for strains 3sh2.32ch2.2 3ch2.4 3sm2.1 and n. phycophila cect 8716t in this study.

the type strain of n. phycophila cect 8716t was described as able to grow at 40degc with an optimum of 30degc whereas the five norwegian isolates showed a lower range of temperature to growth with an optimum of 23degc.

phylogenetic tree based on these sequences showed that scallop isolates form a robust and homoge- neous group together with n. phycophila within genus neptunomonas figure 1. these results were complemented by the analysis of gyrb and rpob genes as well as the concatenated sequences of these three genes which demonstrated the homogenicity of scallop isolates figure 2 and figure s1.
