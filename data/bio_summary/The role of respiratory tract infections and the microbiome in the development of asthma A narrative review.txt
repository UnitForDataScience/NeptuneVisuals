in summary previous studies support the hypothesis that mostly the microbiome in early life is important for the development of wheezingand asthma at a later age.64 relation between respiratory tract infections and the airway microbiome it is likely that respiratory tract infections and the airway microbiome influence each other.

in developed countries the incidence of pneumonia in children until the age of 5 years is 0.05 episodes per child year.17 throat and rhinorrhea in children until the age of 5 years are more common with a reported prevalence of 5.06 episodes per child year in the united states.18the diagnosis of early-life respiratory tract infections in studies that examine the relation of respiratory tract infections with wheezing asthma or lung function varies largely and is mainly divided into respiratory tract infections diagnosed in the laboratory or physician- diagnosed.

however these latter associations seemed only present when the child had allergic sensitization before the age of 2 years.4142 that the number of respiratory tract infections rather than a specific infection is associated with an increased risk of asthma.43 might be that individual and type of respiratory infections are less important for the development of preschool wheezing or childhood asthma than groups and number of respiratory tract infections.only a few studies have examined the effect of early-life respiratory tract infections on lung function.

it is speculated that respiratory tract infections in early life most probably have the greatest adverse effect since both the immune system and the respiratory system are still under development in this stage of life.1516 tract infections could lead to a disturbance in the development of both systems leading to persistent adaptations and risk of respiratory morbidity in later life.it remains unclear whether lower respiratory tract infections influence the risk of lower lung function asthma and wheezing or vice versa.

one prospective cohort study showed that increased bronchial responsiveness in infancy was associated with increased risk of severe bronchiolitis48 lower respiratory system compliance and higher resistance at the age of 2 months were at greater risk for hospitalization for an rsv infection and wheeze after the infection.49 group demonstrated that the association of hrv in the first year of life with wheezing at the age of 4 years remained significant after adjusting for lung function measurements at the age of 2 months.28 another cohort study demonstrated that lower respiratory tract infections in the first year of life were associated with an increased respiratory rate at 1 year of age and that recurrent lower respiratory tract infections were associated with a lower tidal volume and increased lung clearance index irrespective of lung function measured at the age of 6 weeks.50 longitudinal studies with detailed information on respiratory tract infections and lung function measures early and later in life are urgently needed to provide more insight in the causal direction of these associations.

the airway microbiome and respiratory tract infections could influence each other which complicates their relation as well as the understanding of their associations with later life chronic obstructive respiratory diseases figure 1. more detailed population-based prospective cohort studies taking influencing factors into account as well as rct's are needed to further study the causal effect of respiratory tract infections and the microbiome in early life on later life wheezing asthma and lung function.

specifically longitudinal analysis of both the gut and airway microbiome to identify critical periods early lung function measurements to establish causality in the association of respiratory tract infections with wheezing asthma and lung function and the relation between the microbiome respiratory tract infections and the immune system are needed.

population-based prospective cohort studies with frequent measures of respiratory tract infections and the microbiome in early life are needed to better understand the causal pathway between respiratory tract infections and the microbiome and the development of chronic obstructive respiratory diseases in later life.

respiratory tract infections respiratory tract infections occur most frequently in early childhood which is also the age with the most rapid development of the immune and respiratory system.14-16 respiratory tract infection.

for example it has been suggested that the use of antibiotics is a results of confounding by indication meaning that only respiratory tract infections themselves have an effect on wheezing asthma and lung function and that a observed adverse effect of antibiotic use on these outcomes is solely because of the direct relation between the use ofantibiotics and respiratory tract infections.75 intrinsic factorsan explaining factor for the associations of respiratory tract infections with wheezing asthma and lung function is genetic susceptibility.

respiratory tract infections could have an effect on the microbiome both during and after the infection.66 it is possible that the microbiome colonization of the airway could increase the risk of a subsequent respiratory tract infection.hypopharyngeal colonization with s. pneumoniae h. influenza orm.

in a prospective cohort study associations of wheezy or febrile lower respiratory tract infections was only found if children were sensitized by the age of 2 years defined as a positive skin prick test for either food or inhalant allergens.4142 estimates for bronchiolitis with asthma were also found when childrenwith and without atopic parents were compared although for both groups the effect estimates were significant odds ratios 3.11 vs 1.66.40 the role of genetics the immune system and atopy in the associations of the microbiome or respiratory tract infections withwheezing asthma and lung function should be explored further.

additionally a prospective cohort study collected samples of the hypopharyngeal microbiome at the age of 1 week 1 month and 3 months and showed that the microbiome at the age of 1 week represented over 60 of the microbiome at 3 months.56 microbiome it is also likely that the microbiome formation in later life is determined by early colonization.various airway microbiota have been linked to later life asthma and wheezing.

further studies on the role of early respiratory tract infections with later life wheezing asthma and lung function are warranted.the vast majority of the studies focused on respiratory tract infections in the first 1-3 years of life.

additionally the lower airway microbiome is difficult to sample and carries the risk of contamination of the upper respiratory tract microbiome.52 studying the microbiome it is possible to focus on microbiome diversity or composition or on specific bacteria.
