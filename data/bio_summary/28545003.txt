such a situation might bias the potential for coevolution between phytobiome and plant host to those species that have shortest generation times rather than longer lived plants since their evolutionary response rates are slightly closer to their associated microbes.since microbes are going to be growing and thriving in the context of other phytobiome members with large popu- lation sizes and therefore relatively large pools of genetic variation coevolutionary scenarios may be more relevant to understanding how other members of the phytobiomethe challenge of interpreting coevolutionary patterns.although numerous studies refer to coevolutionary relationships between hosts and microbes interpretation of population-wide patterns in a coevolutionary context can be difficult.

it is unclear what fraction of the phytobiome is obligate but many bacteria found within the phytobiome do survive quite well sans host  this discussion is further compounded by the idea that to truly define host range one needs to test many differ- ent plants under the same inoculation conditions and that small changes in inoculation techniques can lead to arguments about what constitutes growth or benefits to the host.

it therefore remains a possibility that functional redundancy  of microbiome mem- bers across host associated communities and experiments could obscure real signatures of host genetic factors that structure phytobiomes.coevolution within microbiomeswhile likely a product of ease of language there is a tendency across microbiome literature to attribute corre- lations in presence of microbes on a particular host species to coevolution.

more- over such changes could create cascading effects as nodulation status appears to shape other broad interac- tions across the microbiome  not restricted to nodulation as certain microbial species appear to also act as 'hubs' to shape and pattern the phytobiome in arabidopsis and maize  highlighting the challenges of trying to map and associate plant genetic determinants with microbiome composi- tion multiple studies have demonstrated that despite a solid genotypic basis for microbiome composition genetic background had relatively little explanatory power compared to environmental effects on the micro- biome as a whole note that studies focusing on mapping host genes that control microbial communities have largely focused on taxonomic identifiers of the microbes rather than func- tional categories.

overall we are likely closing in on the end of the beginning of phytobiome research whereby there is solid foundation of knowledge to predict for what kinds microbes will be found across hosts under different conditions but many questions remain concerning evolutionary dynamics of phytobiomes themselves to be answered in the years to come.references and recommended readingpapers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted asof special interest.. of outstanding interest 2.thus are likely affected by whatever microbes happen to colonize during that single bout of growth perennials spring up year after year in the same area.

lastly given the produc- tion of plant hormones and hormone mimics by phyto- biome members and that tradeoffs between plant immune responses and growth are mediated by complex signaling pathways great potential exists for phytobiome communities to regulate and be regulated by complex feedback loops which integrate stress signals there was and remains a hope that plant breeding technologies can be used to identify genes that control phytobiome development and which could hold the keys to community engineering.

one important yet relatively understudied parameter in regards to phytobiome membership is the degree to which specialization and coevolution between plant species and microbes provides structure to these communities.

in this article i provide an overview of mechanisms enabling adaptation and specialization of phytobiome communities to host plants as well as the potential for plants themselves to recruit and cultivate beneficial interactions.

while other microbes are part of the phytobiome this article focuses solely on bacterial interactions for the sake of simplicity.

regardless of how membership within the phytobiome is classified there exists a vast wealth of knowledge con- cerning molecular mechanisms and evolutionary influ- ences of phytopathogens on host plants and this body of work should not be forgotten when discussing micro- biomes writ large e.g.

moreover horizontal gene transfer of path- ways between microbes  disentangles the evolution- ary dynamics of genes beneficial to plant hosts from those of the rest of the bacterial genome thereby limitingphytobiome recruitment and establishment is a complex process.there are numerous inputs for new microbial strains and species to join phytobiome communities.

since each plant species can survey for numerous molecular signatures of microbes and there is diversity across plant species for which epitopes and even flavors of epitopes for the same protein are recognized it likely that phytobiome inter- action landscapes differ between plants in evolutionarily relevant ways .

here i illustrate sampling from five different time points of the same phytobiome and host populations to highlight when it is clear that coevolution has occurred but also to demonstrate how correlational patterns can confound analyses.

there have been a variety of molecular mechanisms discoveredwhereby bacteria can specifically target other microbes present within the phytobiome to kill or aid  and such intra and interspecies interactions could be a major force structuring microbiome communities.even though coevolution between hosts and phyto- biomes might only occur in relatively limited number conditions there are numerous scenarios that warrant exploration for their coevolutionary potential.

this research has furthered our understanding that microbes can greatly influence host development  and bias evolutionary dynamics of plant populations .
