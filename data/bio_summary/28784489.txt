the data is presented as a cluster analysis conducted on a composite dataset of the one gel using the unweighted pair group with mathematical averages upgma and distance matrices of each dgge gel based on the pearson correlation similarity coefficients.the cluster analysis in all reactors simulating the different regions of the colon resulted in two distinct clusters cluster 1 control 1 cluster 2 treatment 1 control 2 and treatment 2. the treatment 1 altered the total bacteria population during control period 1. however treatment 1 and control 2 showed high similarity in all reactors simulating thefig.
