The fatty acids content in goat milk are different from those found in bovine milk showing a higher proportion of capric acid C 100 myristic acid C 140 pal- mitic acid C 160 stearic acid C 180 and oleic acid C 181 as well as branched-chain fatty acids .Some components of the lipid fraction may contribute to the pre- vention of certain diseases in particular cardiovascular diseases .
