Furthermore the effects of PPs can also be affected by the food matrix the PP structure and the likely interaction of the many PPs that compose our diet.Last but not least the two-way interaction between PPs and gut microbiota has been well-established .

The concept of the 'three P's for gut health' that includes probiotics prebiotics and PPs has been recently created and it promotes PPs to the same biological level of prebiotics .The dose of PPs ingested in the diet either from different foods or herbal medicinal products is more relevant than previously expected reaching amounts above 2 g per day .

A large part of these PPs and particularly those that are oligomeric and poly- meric condensed and hydrolysable tannins are not absorbed in the small intestine and reach the colon where they have effects on gut microbes modulating the colon microbial composition and function.The classical 'prebiotic-like' effect of PPs has been described using both in vitro assays with human gut microbiota and in vivo preclinical studies and clinical trials in which PPs and PP-rich foods modulated gut microbiota to enhance the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.

There they encounter the gut microbes resulting in a two-way interaction in which PPs modulate the gut microbiota composition and the intestinal microbes catabolize the ingested PPs to release metabolites that are often more active and better absorbed than the native phenolic com- pounds.

The review will focus in those PPs that are known to be metabolized by gut microbiota resulting in bioactive metabolites.c 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This last molecule then can go through cyclization dehy- drogenation to form a lactone ring leading to enterolactone in a reaction that seems to be opposite to that converting ellagic acid into urolithins and this conversion is catalyzed by Lactonifactor longoviformis .Biological effects of polyphenol-derived gut microbial metabolitesTaking into account the biochemical transformations of naturally-occurring PPs catalyzed by the gut microbiota the wide range of pharmacological activities initially attributed to dietary PPs must be reconsidered.

In this context the characterization of human gut metabotypes related to the metabolism and effects of dietary PPs is of great interest .As shown in previous sections there is a certain consensus in the existence of microbial communities with the ability to produce specific metabolites from several groups of PPs including isofla- vones  lignans  ellagitannins and proantho- cyanidins .

Many PPs have little bioavailability and reach the colon almost unaltered.

However not all the metabo- lites have the same biological activity and therefore the final health effects of dietary PPs depend on the gut microbiota composition.
