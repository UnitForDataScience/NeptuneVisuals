O-Tyr and Dityr exposure elevated urinary level of indoxyl sulfate which is a circulating uremic toxin and is considered an important marker for oxidative stress.This result implied that O-Tyr and Dityr exposure induced oxidative stress responses in agreement with previous reports that suggested elevation of urinary allantoin level as an indicator for oxidative stress.In support of this view O-Tyr and Dityr exposure increased the urinary level of allantoin which is generated via nonenzymatic methods through high contents of ROS.Furthermore O-Tyr exposure increased the contents of urinary 2-PY and 4-PY and decreased the level of urinary nicotinate and Dityr exposure elevated the contents of urinary 4-PY and nicotinamide N-oxide and reduced the level of urinarynicotinate.

However in our previous research we found 1-week of O-Tyr and Dityr exposure enhanced energy metabolism including promoted fatty acids oxidation glucose-alanine cycle glycolysis and TCA in mice.The possible reason for this difference is that long-term O-Tyr and Dityr exposure induced multiple organ injuries and then led to disorder of metabolic function.In conclusion long-term O-Tyr and Dityr exposure caused obvious metabolic alterations in mice urine and plasma.

Compared with the control group O-Tyr exposure significantly increased P  0.05 kidney weight D and the plasma level of Cre F. Dityr exposure significantly increased P  0.05 kidney weight D kidney index E and the plasma level of Cre F.Effects of O-Tyr and Dityr Exposure on the Levels of VLDL LDL and Choline in Mice.

In this study O-Tyr exposure significantly elevated the level of succinimide in mice urine and implied that O-Tyr exposure caused structural damage in cellular proteins.O-Tyr and Dityr Exposure Induced Oxidative Stress Responses.

Previous reports suggest that the altered contents of nicotinate 2-PY and 4-PY are shown in the changes of oxidative stress responses.In addition our past study has also found that a 1-week O-Tyr and Dityr exposure induced oxidative stress responses and elevated metabolism of vitamin-B3 in mice.Moreover the elevated levels of AOPPs Dityr and 3-NT as markers of proteins oxidative damage and MDA as markers of lipids oxidative damage reduced the activity of T-AOC and level of GSHGSSG combined with the increased level of ROS also supports O-Tyr and Dityr exposure induced oxidative stress responses in mice.O-Tyr and Dityr Exposure Induced Changes in Energy Metabolism.

O-Tyr exposure caused the depletion of citrate in plasma also supported that O-Tyr exposure suppressed the rate of the TCA cycle.

Several previous studies have also demonstrated that dietary sources of oxidized amino acids may be used for the de novo synthesis of proteins such as enzymes and structural components in cells and potentially contributing to cell malfunction and apoptosis and disease status in body.-Tyrosine Tyr is one of the most easily oxidized amino acids in food proteins with representative oxidative products including dityrosine Dityr which is widely detected in food system and identified as universal biomarkers of protein oxidation.Our previous studies have shown that 24-weeks exposure to dietary oxidized tyrosine O-Tyr can lead to oxidative stress inflammation and fibrosis in rat liver and kidney.In addition our previous experiments have also provided evidence that Dityr which is the major oxidized product in O-Tyr accounting for 22 may be responsible for the O-Tyr-induced kidney injury.We have also found O-Tyr- induced oxidative injury in the pancreas potentially resulted in the disruption of glucose metabolism.

O-Tyr exposure showed an increasing tendency of the body weight of mice but there was no statistical significance between the two groups P  0.05.Effects of O-Tyr and Dityr Exposure on Oxidative Damage in Mice.

Compared with the control group we found that O- Tyr and Dityr exposure significantly elevated P  0.05 liver weight G and the levels of hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol H. The O-Tyr and Dityr groups mice also showed significant increase P  0.05 in plasma ALT  I and AST J activities and decrease P  0.05 in plasma TP K levels.Effects of O-Tyr and Dityr Exposure on Nephrotox- icity in Mice.

One urine sample from the O-Tyr group was removed because it was positioned outside the Hotelling's T2 elipse on the score plot.mice strongly revealing that O-Tyr and Dityr exposure induced steatosis and liver injury in mice.
