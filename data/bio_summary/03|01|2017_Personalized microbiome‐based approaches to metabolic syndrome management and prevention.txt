mice fed a lard diet exhibited induction of adipose toll-like receptor tlr immune signaling and inflammation with increased serum lps and adiposity.81 the metabolic effect was transferrable to gf mice whereas gut microbiota from fish-oil diet-fed mice given to lard-fed mice counteracted the metabolic phenotype suggesting that diet has a major effect on microbial composition which in turn modulates adipose tissue inflammation and adiposity.81similarly a key link was suggested between intestinal inflammation gut microbial alterations and nafld.82 in one study mice deficient in inflammasome signaling exhibited changes in gut microbiota composition that aggravated hepatic steatosis driven by massive influx into the portal circulation of tlr4 and tlr9 agonists ultimately leading to increased hepatic tumor necrosis factor tnf-a secretion and resulting in hepatic dam- age and inflammation.82 the metabolic effects were transferable by cohousing suggesting an important cross-talk between gut microbes and host in nafld progression.

in that study acetate infusion led to parasympathetic excitation stimulating b-cell insulin secretion.51 although most of the above studies indicate a beneficial role for scfas in energy and glucose homeostasis larger human studies are needed to eluci- date possible personalization in the scfa response.understanding personalized responses to scfas may enable the development of scfa supplementation as a novel individualized or generalized treatment modality for mets manifestations.bile acidsbile acids are produced primarily by hepatic cholesterol catabolism and are transported into the gallbladder and the intestinal lumen by postprandial peristalsis.60-62 the microbiome at the distal small intestine and colon can transform primary bile acids into secondary bile acids.60-62 mice treated with antibiotics or gf mice fea- ture low concentrations of secondary bile acids with an altered expression profile of genes involved in bile acid conjugation and reabsorption indicating that the gut microbiota is responsible for bile acid synthesis diver- sity and possibly host epithelial uptake.63-65 in addition to the role of bile acids in facilitating dietary fat diges- tion they are now recognized as participating in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis.6667 as such some bile acids have shown promising initial results in the treatment of mets disorders such as insulin resistance hypercholesterolemia and nafld.6768most of the physiological effects of bile acids are mediated by the g-protein-coupled receptor tgr5 and the nuclear receptor farnesoid x receptor fxr which is a transcription factor that controls the endoge- nous synthesis and release of bile acids with fxr activation resulting in inhibition of hepatic bile acids biosynthesis.6369obese and insulin-resistant mice exhib- ited decreased gut microbiota diversity accompanied by a reduction in secondary bile acids and hepatic enzymes involved in bile acid biosynthesis with increased fxr and decreased tgr5 expression.70 activation of tgr5 by bile acids led to improved insulin sensitivity whereas binding of bile acids to fxr resulted in lowered cholesterol and reduced liver and serum triglycerides.67experiments in gf and antibiotic-treated mice sug- gest that the microbiome may modulate fxr and fxr-related genes that control bile acid synthe- sis.636471 intestinal fxr-deficient mice fed an hfd exhibited decreased weight gain glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and were protected against the development of fatty liver.7273 blocking intestinal fxr by administration of an fxr antagonist modified bile acid composition and promoted differentiation of white adipose to thermogenic brown tissue also termed adi- pose tissue browning and decreased obesity and insu- lin resistance.74 ryan et al.75 found that the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on metabolism including improvement in glucose tolerance were associated with changes in gut microbiota and were diminished infxr-null mice.

this suggests that recommendations for dietary modifi- cation in individuals suffering atherosclerosis would potentially modulate the microbiome composition thereby affecting disease pathogenesis.effects of mechanisms implicated in gut microbiome on metsdespite many associations implicating gut microbes in whole-body metabolic responses and mets-related mor- bidities the underlying mechanisms are exceptionally complex and currently elusive.

together all these animal studies pointed towards a dominant role for the gut microbiota in regulating bile acid diversity and fxr signaling which in turn regulates mets complications.obese humans followed after bariatric surgery fea- tured long-term changes in their gut microbiome inde- pendent of body mass index.

the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with gut dysbiosis and shift in the metabolic function of the gut microbiota.

as is high- lighted in the following sections some of the interindivi- dual variability in human mets manifestations and response to treatment may be associated with interindivi- dual differences in the gut microbiome.

1. seminal stud- ies by jeffrey gordon's group showed that the gut microbiome is different in obese compared with lean people and rodents2324 and that its interaction with the host can significantly affect the development of obe- sity.2425 follow-up studies have since shown an associa- tion and contribution of microbial dysbiosis to other mets-related diseases such as t2d26 nafld2728 and atherosclerosis.2930 beyond a description of bacte- rial community composition and disease association microbiome research is moving towards mechanistic elucidation of the molecular pathways and metabolites activated and produced by the microbial community as well as characterization of their effects on host mets- related manifestations.

these analyses may help develop in coming years a new precision medicine approach for diagnosing and treating mets- related pathologies.31metabolic consequences of interindividual variations in the microbiomethe gut microbiome features a high interindividual var- iability in community composition function and inter- action with the host all potentially bearing an influence on variable mets features in different individuals.

in obese and overweight subjects dietary intervention in obesity was reported to be more beneficial in subjectswho had high microbial gene richness.36 adding to the complexity is the finding that not only does the compo- sition function and richness of the microbiome play a role in disease but that the growth dynamics of the bac- teria in the gut are also associated with mets and die- tary changes may exert differential effects on these human dynamics.37atherosclerosis another diet-mediated condition is closely associated with multiple risk factors and conditions comprising mets and may lead to devastat- ing complications including ischemic heart disease heart failure and cerebrovascular disease.

yet the causal connection between gut microbiota bile acid production and sig- naling the pathogenesis of mets-related disorders and potential perturbation of these pathways as modes of mets treatment merit further investigation in prospec- tive human trials.trimethylaminestrimethylamine is a metabolite generated by microbial metabolism of l-carnitine derived from red meat and by conversion of phosphatidylcholine derived from cheese and eggs.

mice treated with antibiotics or gf mice had undetectable or levels of tma and tmao29 gf mice placed in conventional cages under specific pathogen-free spf conditions termed conventiona- lized mice featured increased levels of tmao indicat- ing an obligatory role of the microbiota in tmao production.29 correspondingly mice treated with anti- biotics or gf mice fed with l-carnitine or phosphatidyl- choline diets had a lower number of atherosclerotic lesions reduced accumulation of foam cells and a lower number of hyperactive platelets.2930 an essential role for the gut microbiota in generating tmao was further confirmed in human subjects treated with l-carnitine or phosphatidylcholine and antibiotics driv- ing a near complete suppression of tmao.2939 these interesting and potentially clinically important direct roles of tmao in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases merit further prospective studies.microbiota modulation of inflammationobesity insulin resistance atherosclerosis and steato- hepatitis are all mets disorders associated with inflam- mation.

as described above microbial production of tmas such as tmao derived from red meat is directly linked to the development of atherosclerosis.29 the generation by gut microbiota of secondary bile acids facilitates dietary fat digestion and improves the plasma and liver lipid profile and indeed bile acids have been used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.67 furthermore and as described above microbiota may modulate the immune system thereby inducing low-grade inflamma- tion contributing to the development of many mets- related diseases including atherosclerosis.
