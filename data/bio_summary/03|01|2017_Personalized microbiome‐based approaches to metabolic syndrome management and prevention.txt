In that study acetate infusion led to parasympathetic excitation stimulating b-cell insulin secretion.51 Although most of the above studies indicate a beneficial role for SCFAs in energy and glucose homeostasis larger human studies are needed to eluci- date possible personalization in the SCFA response.Understanding personalized responses to SCFAs may enable the development of SCFA supplementation as a novel individualized or generalized treatment modality for MetS manifestations.Bile acidsBile acids are produced primarily by hepatic cholesterol catabolism and are transported into the gallbladder and the intestinal lumen by postprandial peristalsis.60-62 The microbiome at the distal small intestine and colon can transform primary bile acids into secondary bile acids.60-62 Mice treated with antibiotics or GF mice fea- ture low concentrations of secondary bile acids with an altered expression profile of genes involved in bile acid conjugation and reabsorption indicating that the gut microbiota is responsible for bile acid synthesis diver- sity and possibly host epithelial uptake.63-65 In addition to the role of bile acids in facilitating dietary fat diges- tion they are now recognized as participating in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis.6667 As such some bile acids have shown promising initial results in the treatment of MetS disorders such as insulin resistance hypercholesterolemia and NAFLD.6768Most of the physiological effects of bile acids are mediated by the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5 and the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor FXR which is a transcription factor that controls the endoge- nous synthesis and release of bile acids with FXR activation resulting in inhibition of hepatic bile acids biosynthesis.6369Obese and insulin-resistant mice exhib- ited decreased gut microbiota diversity accompanied by a reduction in secondary bile acids and hepatic enzymes involved in bile acid biosynthesis with increased FXR and decreased TGR5 expression.70 Activation of TGR5 by bile acids led to improved insulin sensitivity whereas binding of bile acids to FXR resulted in lowered cholesterol and reduced liver and serum triglycerides.67Experiments in GF and antibiotic-treated mice sug- gest that the microbiome may modulate FXR and FXR-related genes that control bile acid synthe- sis.636471 Intestinal FXR-deficient mice fed an HFD exhibited decreased weight gain glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and were protected against the development of fatty liver.7273 Blocking intestinal FXR by administration of an FXR antagonist modified bile acid composition and promoted differentiation of white adipose to thermogenic brown tissue also termed adi- pose tissue browning and decreased obesity and insu- lin resistance.74 Ryan et al.75 found that the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on metabolism including improvement in glucose tolerance were associated with changes in gut microbiota and were diminished inFXR-null mice.

Mice fed a lard diet exhibited induction of adipose Toll-like receptor TLR immune signaling and inflammation with increased serum LPS and adiposity.81 The metabolic effect was transferrable to GF mice whereas gut microbiota from fish-oil diet-fed mice given to lard-fed mice counteracted the metabolic phenotype suggesting that diet has a major effect on microbial composition which in turn modulates adipose tissue inflammation and adiposity.81Similarly a key link was suggested between intestinal inflammation gut microbial alterations and NAFLD.82 In one study mice deficient in inflammasome signaling exhibited changes in gut microbiota composition that aggravated hepatic steatosis driven by massive influx into the portal circulation of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists ultimately leading to increased hepatic tumor necrosis factor TNF-a secretion and resulting in hepatic dam- age and inflammation.82 The metabolic effects were transferable by cohousing suggesting an important cross-talk between gut microbes and host in NAFLD progression.

Together all these animal studies pointed towards a dominant role for the gut microbiota in regulating bile acid diversity and FXR signaling which in turn regulates MetS complications.Obese humans followed after bariatric surgery fea- tured long-term changes in their gut microbiome inde- pendent of body mass index.

In obese and overweight subjects dietary intervention in obesity was reported to be more beneficial in subjectswho had high microbial gene richness.36 Adding to the complexity is the finding that not only does the compo- sition function and richness of the microbiome play a role in disease but that the growth dynamics of the bac- teria in the gut are also associated with MetS and die- tary changes may exert differential effects on these human dynamics.37Atherosclerosis another diet-mediated condition is closely associated with multiple risk factors and conditions comprising MetS and may lead to devastat- ing complications including ischemic heart disease heart failure and cerebrovascular disease.

Com- mon risk factors for features of MetS include abdomi- nal obesity hyperglycemia hypertension elevated triglyceride levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.2 The prevalence of MetS is increas- ing globally and estimated to encompass around 25- 35 of the adult population worldwide2 highlighting the need for controlling the risk factors development and progression of MetS-linked diseases.Limited efficacy of global dietary recommendations in MetSIn obese individuals weight loss can improve glycemic control lower blood pressure and normalize cholesterol levels.3 Consequently a change of dietary habitsmostly a reduction in caloric intake is probably the most commonly prescribed strategy for the prevention and treatment of MetS.

Such treatment may potentially enable modification of host adipose and mucosal inflammation thereby affecting metabolic homeostasis and the risk of MetS diseases.Summary and future perspectives from personal microbiome to personalized treatmentsThe potential contribution of the microbiome to MetS pathogenesis and clinical manifestations coupled with its plasticity make the microbiome an appealing thera- peutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of features of MetS.

This suggests that recommendations for dietary modifi- cation in individuals suffering atherosclerosis would potentially modulate the microbiome composition thereby affecting disease pathogenesis.Effects of mechanisms implicated in gut microbiome on MetSDespite many associations implicating gut microbes in whole-body metabolic responses and MetS-related mor- bidities the underlying mechanisms are exceptionally complex and currently elusive.

The severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with gut dysbiosis and shift in the metabolic function of the gut microbiota.

As is high- lighted in the following sections some of the interindivi- dual variability in human MetS manifestations and response to treatment may be associated with interindivi- dual differences in the gut microbiome.

These analyses may help develop in coming years a new precision medicine approach for diagnosing and treating MetS- related pathologies.31Metabolic consequences of interindividual variations in the microbiomeThe gut microbiome features a high interindividual var- iability in community composition function and inter- action with the host all potentially bearing an influence on variable MetS features in different individuals.
