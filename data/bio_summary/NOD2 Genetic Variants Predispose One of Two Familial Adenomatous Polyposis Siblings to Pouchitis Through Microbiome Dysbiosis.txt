Four immediate family members were recruited and are designated patients A B C and D. Siblings A and B had a total proctocolectomy with IPAA scheduled within one week of each other.

Brothers are designated A and B with patient B developing pouchitis.Figure 2.

Genotyping of the par- ents indicated that patient B inherited the NOD2 risk alleles from his healthy father patient D. These data indicate that patient B had two variants found in the NOD2 signaling pathway that play a role in enteric host defense.To discern whether bacterial dysbiosis could account for why one sibling developed pouchitis whereas the other did not we per- formed 16S rRNA gene sequencing from the terminal ileum and rectum at the time of IPAA surgery.

Patient B had a one-stage surgery while patient A required a two-stage surgery incorporating a temporary ileostomy.

Patient B developed his first episode of pouchitis three months after surgery.

Patient B subsequently developed pouchitis while patient A did not.
