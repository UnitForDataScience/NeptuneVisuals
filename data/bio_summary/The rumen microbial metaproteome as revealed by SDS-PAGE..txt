the aim of this study was to explore the metaproteome of bovine and ovine ruminal digesta using 2d sds-page.results digesta samples were taken via ruminal fistulae and by gastric intubation or at slaughter and stored in glycerol at -80 degc.

samples from beef cattle and fattening lambs receiving a predominantly concentrate diet produced clearer gels but the pattern of spots was inconsistent between samples making comparisons difficult.conclusion this work demonstrated for the first time that 2d-page reveals key structural proteins and enzymes in the rumen microbial community despite its high complexity and that taxonomic information can be deduced from the analysis.

this was most notable in the samples from the silage concentrate fed reindeer and cow samples.

the digesta samples were taken via cannula from the silageconcentrate fed cows and reindeer and the fresh samples taken from the forageconcentrate fed lambs contained a large proportion of coarse dietary fibre.

for these samples a method was adapted to re- move the fibre and enrich the bacteria fraction using dif- ferential centrifugation and a wash dilution procedure in comparison the samples from the foragebarley concentrate fed dairy and beef cattle taken by gastric tube contained very little in the way of plant fibre and were processed as received.

the aims of this study were to investigate the effectiveness of sds page methods for generating metaproteomic information from ruminal digesta and to evaluate the information that can be obtained by this method.methodsanimals and digesta sampling methodssamples of ruminal digesta were obtained from dairy cows in sweden and finland reindeer in finland and beef cattle and lambs in scotland.

gels from samples from dairy cows fed a high proportion of grass silage were consistently obscured by co-staining of humic compounds.

however technical issues associated with feed material contamination which affects the reproducibility of electrophoresis of different samples limits its value.keywords cattle proteomics rumen sheepbackgroundthe rumen is the primary digestive organ in ruminants such as cattle sheep buffaloes and deer.
