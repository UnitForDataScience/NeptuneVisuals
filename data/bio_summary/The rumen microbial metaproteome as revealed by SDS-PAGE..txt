Here contam- inants co-stained by the Coomassie Blue consistently ob- scured proteins in all of the gels prepared from the protein extracts A typical feature of the 2D gel was a dark streak in the acidic region of the isoelectric focus- sing Even where it was possible to identify faint spots on these gels there was not sufficient protein to identify using LC-MSMS.Repeated 2D SDS-PAGE gels from different extracts from the same sample produced highly reproducible re- sults see Additional file In contrast spot patterns were poorly reproduced between 2D gels of different samples preventing any meaningful comparison of pro- tein abundance between gels.

A protein extraction protocol was developed to maximise yield and representativeness of the protein content.The proteome of ruminal digesta taken from dairy cows fed a high concentrate diet was dominated by a few veryhighly expressed proteins which were identified by LC-MSMS to be structural proteins such as actin and a- and b-tubulins derived from ciliate protozoa.

The pellet was resuspended in the Rabilloud buffer described previously and the concentration of total protein extract was assayed using the RCDC method Bio-Rad against a BSA standard.Visual inspection of the dissolved protein extract re- vealed some brown discolouration of the solution indi- cating the presence of dissolved organic compounds.

Visibly abundant protein spots were selected on the 2D gels for protein identification by LC-MSMS.

The estimation of protein loading on thegel was also affected by contaminants affecting the result of the absorbance readings taken as part of the RCDC assay used to measure protein concentration BioRad 2.The additional methods including the wash dilution column filtration and phenolic extraction steps carried out to eliminate or reduce humic compound contamin- ation were all unsuccessful and did not produce any clearly resolved 2D SDS-PAGE results.

However in some cases the MWt and MWe value differed due to a partial protein reference sequence or the protein separ- ating into subunits on the gel.Protozoal proteinsThe 2D SDS-PAGE of the rumen fluid taken from high concentrate fed dairy cows was dominated by a few very abundant proteins Fig.

The diets were fed ad libitum as a total mixed ration.Cows and reindeer from Finland were fed the same total mixed ration based on grass silage and concentrates 6040 forageconcentrate ratio on a DM basis at a re- stricted level of intake to meet maintenance energy and protein requirements.Beef cattle kept at Easter Bush Farm Midlothian Scotland received 60 forage with 40 concentrate diet in which the main ingredient was barley 20.Lambs received a diet comprising 70 forage and 30 complete feed concentrate containing 22.6 barley 4 wheat 2 soya minerals and supplements.Ruminal digesta samples 4 ml were taken manually from cows and reindeer in Finland and Sweden via a ru- minal cannula diluted in 8 ml PBS buffer containing 20 glycerol and transported to the laboratory on dry ice where they were stored at -80 degC.

This was carried out using MASCOT Matrix Science Inc. which uses a probabil- istic scoring system for protein identificationinference adapted from the MOlecular Weight SEarch MOWSE algorithm.Results and discussionEffects of different sample types on electrophoresisThe ruminal metaproteome from a variety of species and sample types was characterised by SDS-PAGE using digesta samples obtained from a variety of ruminant spe- cies including cattle sheep and reindeer fed different diets.

This was most notable in the samples from the silage concentrate fed reindeer and cow samples.

The digesta samples were taken via cannula from the silageconcentrate fed cows and reindeer and the fresh samples taken from the forageconcentrate fed lambs contained a large proportion of coarse dietary fibre.
