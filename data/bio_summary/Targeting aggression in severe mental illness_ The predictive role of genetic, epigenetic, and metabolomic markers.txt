It is conceivable that the joint analysis of genetic epigenetic and metabo- lomic data might help refining the prediction of aggressive behavior particularly in at risk populations such as those affected by SMI.One final introductory remark concerns the hypothesis that an additional pathophysiological component playing a role in aggressive behavior might be determined by distinct alteration of gut microbiota.It is well established that intestinal microbiota and the brain areCandidate gene association studies of aggressive behavior in severe mental illness.Severe mental illnessCandidate gene PolymorphismType of genotype-phenotype associationReferenceSchizophreniaHTR2Ars6311 - 1438 AGAG carriers had better emotional regulationTPH1rs1800532 A218CNo association with aggressive behaviorBDNFrs6265 Val66MetBDNF MetVal genotype were more aggressive than patients with ValValgenotypeBDNFrs6265 Val66MetNo association with aggressive behaviorBDNFrs6265 Val66MetNo association with aggressive behaviorMTHFRrs1801131 rs1801133 T-allele polymorphism of rs1801133 and the T-C haplotype were associated withaggressive behaviorNRGNrs12807809CC genotype associated with higher aggression compared to other genotypes Autism spectrum disorder ITGB3rs5918TT genotype associated with symptoms of aggressionHTR2A 5-Hydroxytryptamine Serotonin Receptor 2A TPH1 tryptophan hydroxylase 1 BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor MTHFR methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase NRGN neurogranin ITGB3 b3 integrin.connected bidirectionally and that alterations in the gut microbiota might lead to behavioral disruption as well as influencing the suscept- ibility to SMI with externalizing behaviors such as ASD  .

If replicated in further molecular genetic studies these genes might be implemented in predictive models of aggressive behavior in BD.Autism spectrum disorderDespite the vast amount of molecular genetic data on ASD and the relatively high prevalence of externalizing behavior in this spectrum of conditions there is paucity of data on genetic predictors of aggressive- ness in ASD.

The latter study is a testament that integrative molecular approaches combining CNV dataset with next-generation sequencing in large and accurately phenotyped samples might pave the path toward the identification of reliable genetic determinants of riskfor ASD which might also modulate a shared susceptibility toaggressive behavior.Attention-deficithyperactivity disorderAs in other complex psychiatric disorders only recently researchers have focused on genome-wide approaches to identify genetic signatures for aggressive behavior in ADHD.

Interestingly in mice gut microbiota appeared to be crucial for the programming and presentation of distinct normal social behaviors including social motivation and preference for social novelty which are generally altered in neurodevelopmental disorders such as SCZ and ASD .These data suggest that alterations in the microbiome might contribute to the development of aggressive behavior particularly in individuals affected by SMI.Aims and methodology of literature searchIn our study we aim to selectively review the recent evidence about genetic epigenetic and metabolomic predictors of hetero-aggression in SMI namely SCZ BD ASD and ADHD focusing on human data.

And recent epigen- ome-wide analysis in peripheral white blood cells of a large twin sample showed a positive relationship between DNA methylation levels and aggressive behavior near the trichorhinophalangeal synrome I TRPS1 gene on chromosome 8 and between the non-coding RNA PARD6G antisense RNA 1 PARD6G-AS1 and the activity-dependent neuropro- tective protein 2 gene ADNP2 on chromosome 18 .These specific alterations in the genetic and epigenetic make-up ofaggressive individuals might determine distinct alterations in the physiological pathways of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System PNS and CNS regulating behavioral control.Detection of biochemical signals of aggressive behaviorOne crucial issue in the study of complex traits such as psychiatric disorders or behavioral phenotypes is the detection of biological signals that might predate the manifestation of symptoms and consequently help enabling preventive strategies.

Another study using 1H NMR spectroscopy found that metabolomic profiling of urine samples discriminated effectively controls from ASD patients with the latter showing higher levels of b-alanine glycine taurine and succinate concentrations and lower levels of creatine and 3-methylhis- tidine .Further urinary metabolomics profiling of 26 ASD and 24 healthychildren showed substantial differences with ASD patients presenting higher urinary levels of succinate and glycolate but lower levels of hippurate 3-hydroxyphenylacetate vanillylhydracrylate 3- hydroxy- hippurate 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-hydroxyacetate 1H- indole-3-acetate phosphate palmitate stearate and 3- methyladipate than healthy children .

Interestingly when analyzed metabolomics profile in ASD children with and without gastrointestinal dysfunction symptoms separately the ASD children with gastrointestinal dysfunction symp- toms had significantly altered gut microbiome metabolites whereas ASD children without gastrointestinal dysfunction symptoms exhibited similar gut bacterial metabolite profiles to controls.In summary interpretation of these data offers at least two plausible connections between gut microbiota and aggressiveness.
