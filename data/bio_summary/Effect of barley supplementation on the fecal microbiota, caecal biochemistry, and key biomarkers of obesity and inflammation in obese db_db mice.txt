An alpha of 0.05 was used to reject null hypotheses.ResultsPhysical and dietary parameters of miceBody weight of all obese mice with and without barley was similar median  47.3 g for supplemented mice median  45.6 g for obese controls at the end of the study 8 weeks and both were significantly higher compared to lean mice median  30 g P  0.0001 Kruskal-Wallis test.While food consumption was higher in barley group average5.9 - 0.87 g foodanimalday compared to obese-control group 4.4 - 0.4 g foodanimalday and to lean control 3.0 - 0.1 g foodanimalday P  0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test the body weight gain was similar between obese con- trol and barley throughout the study period Fig.

In contrast the less studied succinic acid showed in this study a much lower concentration in caecal contents of barley-supplemented mice compared to all obese mice Table .Biomarkers of obesity and inflammationUsing a subset of samples results from plasma biomarkers of obesity and inflammation showed that the levels of fasting glucose triglycerides total-CHL and LDL-CHL were simi- lar between all obese mice Supplementary Table S2 even though barley group showed higher BMI compared to obese control Table S1.

In this study lean mice had higher fecal Bifidobacterium compared to obese mice with and without barley supplementation while Lactobacillus was lower in lean mice and higher with barley.

Lean mice had the highest abundance of Firmicutes and the lowest Bacteroi- detes while barley-supplemented mice showed opposite abundances of these two major phyla barley group had55 of Bacteroidetes compared to 25 in lean mice and only 40 of Firmicutes compared to 65 in lean mice Fig.

This suggests an important difference between genetically obese and diet-induced obese rodent models as shown elsewhere .In this study barley supplementation decreased plasma resistin insulin and protein carbonyls compared to obese controls.

Dotted lines represent medians straight lines represent averagesunweighted UniFrac is important to highlight because other studies from our research group have shown a clustering of all control samples lean and obese separated from whole- wheat-supplemented obese mice using unweighted UniFrac distances .

Interestingly the BMI in barley group was higher compared to obese control and lean control but this phenomenon was not due to body fat accumulation since all obese mice with and without barley had similar adiposity indexes.

Caecal butyrate concentrations were similar in all obese mice while succinic acid was lower in the barley group compared to obese controls.

Cg-Dock7mLeprdbOlaHsd--lean black heterozygous mice were used as lean controls n  11 for the obese db db control because they have the closely linked recombinant genes Dock7mLeprdb instead of the LeprdbLeprdb that makes the obese counterparts leptin receptor deficient.

The higher BMIs in barley-supplemented mice compared to obese controls was due to a higher body weight although not statistically significantly P  0.3922 at the end of the study Mann-Whitney test and a relatively lower body length also not statistically significant when compared to obese controls P  0.2166 Mann-Whitney test which may be related to the difference in caloric intake Table  Table S1.
