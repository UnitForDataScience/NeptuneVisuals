ethical approval for the study was obtained from the university of guelph animal care committee approval number eaup 3793.study design and outcomesresults were compared between a retrospective cohort of calves examined for 12 months before implementation of the algorithm 529 calves on farm 1 and 639 calves on farm 2 and a prospective cohort of calves examined for 12 months after implementation of the algorithm 768 calves on farm 1 and 842 calves on farm 2. outcomes assessed before and after implementation of the algorithm were 1 incidence of diarrhoea 2 antimicrobial treatment rates 3 overall mortality and4 mortality of diarrhoeic calves.data collectionelectronic and paper-based calf health records during the course of the study were reviewed and the following events occurring during the first 30 days of the life of each calf were recorded 1 date of birth 2 age and date at first diarrhoeic episode 3 age and date at time of first treatment for diarrhoea and 4 antimicrobial agents used.

on farm 2 calves were fed non-antibiotic treated milk replacer in the period before implementation of the algorithm and non-medicated pasteurised milk in the period after implementation of the algorithm.faecal samples from 15 healthy calves 30 days of age were collected from each farm 6 weeks to 1 week before implementation of the algorithm along with 15 healthy calves matched for age and farm 12 months after implementation of the algorithm.

the cir of antimicrobial treatment rates was 80 lower after implementation of the algorithm on both farms cir 0.19 95 confidence interval 0.17-0.21. there was no difference in the cir of overall mortality but the cri for mortality of diarrhoeic calves was lower in the period after implementation of the algorithm on one farm.

all calves fed non-antibiotic treated pasteurised milk on farm 1 before implementation of the algorithm and farm 2 after implementation of the algorithm might be expected to be similar and vice versa .

on farm 1 calves were fed non-antibiotic treated pasteurised milk during the period before implementation of the algorithm and non-medicated milk replacer in the period after implementation of the algorithm.

in the period before implementation of the algorithm diarrhoeic calves from farm 1 received three different antimicro- bial agents concurrently whereas two antimicrobial agents were used on farm 2 .

the milking herds consisted of approximately 600 cows on farm 1 and 700 cows on farm 2. the average milk production was 10300 kgcowyear on farm 1 and 10400 kgcowyear on farm 2. neither farm had a treatment protocol for diarrhoeic calves at the time of enrolment.

therefore the aims of the present study were to evaluate the impact of an antibiotic use algorithm on calf health morbidity and mortality and antimicrobial treatment rates and to characterise the faecal microbiota of healthy calves before and after implementing the algorithm.materials and methodsimpact of an antimicrobial use algorithm on calf health and treatment rates farmstwo large commercial dairy farms located within a 120 km radius of the university of guelph ontario canada were selected to participate in the study on the basis of convenience since both farms had a record keeping system for documenting health and disease events treatment of calves and outcomes.
