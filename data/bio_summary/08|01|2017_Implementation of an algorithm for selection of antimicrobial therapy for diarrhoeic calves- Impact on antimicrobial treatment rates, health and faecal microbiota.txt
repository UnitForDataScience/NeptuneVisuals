On farm 2 calves were fed non-antibiotic treated milk replacer in the period before implementation of the algorithm and non-medicated pasteurised milk in the period after implementation of the algorithm.Faecal samples from 15 healthy calves 30 days of age were collected from each farm 6 weeks to 1 week before implementation of the algorithm along with 15 healthy calves matched for age and farm 12 months after implementation of the algorithm.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee approval number eAUP 3793.Study design and outcomesResults were compared between a retrospective cohort of calves examined for 12 months before implementation of the algorithm 529 calves on farm 1 and 639 calves on farm 2 and a prospective cohort of calves examined for 12 months after implementation of the algorithm 768 calves on farm 1 and 842 calves on farm 2.

In the period following implementation of the algorithm farm staff registered the cause of death if the cause of death was not clearly identified a gross post-mortem examination was performed but no additional samples were collected for laboratory examination.Design and implementation of the algorithmA multidisciplinary team of large animal internal medicine and infectious disease specialists an epidemiologist and the veterinary practitioner for each farm collaborated to develop an algorithm for use of antimicrobial agents.

Calves that developed diarrhoea on farm 1 were treated with three antimicrobial agents trimethoprim-sulphadoxine spectinomycin and lincomycin while diarrhoeic calves on farm 2 were treated with one antimicrobial agent orally sulphamethazine and one parenterally trimethoprim-sulphadoxine or sodium ceftiofur.
