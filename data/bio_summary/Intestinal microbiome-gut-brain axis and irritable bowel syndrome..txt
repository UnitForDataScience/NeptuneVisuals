ibs severity could also be pre- dicted by a complex microbial signature consisting of bacterial families disseminated over the whole phylogenetic tree .intestinal microbiota and psychological profiles in ibsjeffery and colleagues  comparing the fecal mi- crobiota of ibs patients with non-ibs individuals separated their ibs cohort into three main clusters a normal-like cluster with microbial characteristics highly similar to healthy controls and two ibs clus- ters the latter characterized by high firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio.

a dysbalanced firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio   an increase in clostrid- ium xiva and ruminococcus  a reduction in bi- fidobacterium    as well as a reduction in methanogens and butyrate- a scfa producing bac- teria in ibs with diarrhea ibs-d and ibs with di- arrhea and constipation mixed ibs-m patients  .some enterotypes and associations with clinical phenotypes have also been described prevotella- predominant enterotype seemed to be more com- mon in healthy subjects bacteroides enterotype was more represented in ibs patients while the clostridi- ales-dominant enterotype was associated with faster colonic transit time.

host-microbe in- teractions in the gut are important elements in the pathogenesis of ibs and other functional gastroin- testinal diseases .a variety of methods have been used to assess the human intestinal microbiota in ibs and this might be one reason along with different diets lifestyles and geographical factors why results are contradic- tory and difficult to summarize.

many studies have attempted to identify microbiota discriminating ibs patients from healthy controls and to define dysbio- sis in ibs and its sub-populations  .

however a widely accepted concept of bacterial dysbiosis in ibs has not yet been established since a large pro- portion of ibs patients display a normal-like micro- biota profile  .
