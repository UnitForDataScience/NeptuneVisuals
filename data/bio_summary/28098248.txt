Here we measured fecal-associated bacterial archaeal and fungal communities of dairy cows from 2 weeks to the middle of first lactation 2 years as well as rumen-associated communities from weaning 8 weeks to first lactation.

Sequence coverage was deemed sufficient as determined by a Good's coverage greater than 97 for all bacterial and fungal communities and most archaeal communities.

A total of 10 fecal archaeal communities 2-week 8 4-week 2 had low Good's coverage 0-93 after repeated sequencing yielded a minimum of 36000 raw contigs per sample Supplementary Table 3.Rumen and fecal communities are consistent with known cow microbiota.

All fungal communities were dominated by the family Neocallimastigaceae or OTUs unclassified at the phylum level Supplementary Table 4.Gut communities show higher alpha-diversity but lower beta-diversity with age.

Controls for animal identity among fecal communities and randomized groups among all communities were not significant for any amplicon.Inter-animal variation decreased with age as evidenced by decreased spread of Bray-Curtis values within age groups F1 as well as higher numbers of shared OTUs in older animals F2.

In general fecal fungal communities showed the same trends in the same F-OTUs as rumen communities.

Animal growth as defined by average daily gain ADG in weight kg correlated to the structure andor composition of archaeal and fungal communities in 1-year rumen liquids while bacterial communities in 2-year rumen liquids correlated to ADG.

Scours did not significantly impact archaeal communities and was not tested in fungal communities as this amplicon was not sequenced for 2 week samples.

As pre-weaning calves are pre-ruminants meaning they have an un- or under-developed rumen and much of their dietary intake by-passes the rumen feces is a useful proxy for gut communities at this age and allows for sampling from animals over time.We found that bacterial communities quickly establish in the calf GIT feces as early as 2 weeks of age con- firming previous reports.

Thus we investigated rumen communities in a limited number of animals in addition to fecal communities in all ani- mals from 8 weeks onward.
