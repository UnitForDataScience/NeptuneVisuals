E coli expansion due to Paneth cell number and function defects has also been observed independently of mouse genetic background in a model of GVHD.Those observations highlight the major role of Paneth cells in controlling E coli intestinal population independently of mouse strain and mouse antimicrobial repertoire.Taken together the results of this study showed thatboth MS mice and Sox9floxflox-vil-Cre mice exhibit fecal E coli expansion and visceral hypersensitivity 2 oral gavage of conventional mice with E coli induces fecal E coli increase and visceral hypersensitivity and 3 lysozyme oral treatment of MS mice can prevent E coli fecal expansion and visceral hypersensitivity.

Increase of E coli abundance was indeed observed by plating fecal pellet on selective agar in feces of mice submitted to MS C P .0002 and Sox9 oxflox-vil-cre mice D P .042.E coli increase in MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-cre positively correlated with high AUC of EMG attesting of visceral hypersensitivity E and F.E coli Gavages Induced Fecal Dysbiosis Associated With Visceral Hypersensitivity Without InflammationBy comparing key microbial features VIP previously identified as important in discrimination of mouse microbiota according to their antimicrobial activity we noted that E coli expansion was observed in both mouse models MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-cre mice.

More generally AUC of EMG activity in response to increasing volumes of distension was higher in mice submitted to E coli oral gavage compared with vehicle-treated mice P .002 F.E coli gavage did not trigger ileal inflammation as TNFa ileal concentrations remained unchanged after E coli gavages G and no modification of IFNg was observed data not shown.Oral Treatment of Young MS Mice With Lysozyme Prevented Stress-induced E coli Expansion and Associated Visceral Hypersensitivity in AdultsWe wondered if an oral supplementation of MS mice with lysozyme could conversely prevent E coliexpansion and visceral hypersensitivity.

Interestingly previous works showed that MS induces microbiota dysbiosis in favor of coliforms in rats and monkeys.Finally in 8-week-old rats MS induced micro- biota dysbiosis characterized by reduced diversity and higher representation of Proteobacteria phylum including Enterobacteriaceae family.All these data strongly sup- port the role of Paneth cells in control of E coli population in small and large intestine.E coli expansion in our models of Paneth cell defect MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-Cre was observed without a broader microbiota overgrowth Supplementary Figure 8.

In mice Paneth cells appear only 2 weeks after birth-and they are sensitive to environmental factors including enteric infectionsand early life stress.Indeed MS performed in rats decreases epithelial secretory cell lineages number including Paneth cells.Furthermore neonatal MS induces visceral hypersensitivity in adulthood.This observation questioned a potential role of Paneth cell defect triggered by an environmental factor like MS in the induction of visceral hypersensitivity.In the mouse model of MS established in this study we show that MS impaired Paneth cell functions attested by a decrease of lysozyme expression but not the number of Paneth cells as observed in rats.

Nevertheless LZM treatment results in preventing E coli overgrowth and visceral hypersensitivity induced by MS. Interestingly lysozyme oral treatment prevented MS- induced E coli expansion but not TNFa increase in ileum suggesting that inflammation driven by TNFa release may be responsible for Paneth cell defect and E coli expansion and not the opposite ie E coli overwhelming inducing in- testinal inflammation.

More generally AUC of EMGsmaller antimicrobial activity of fecal supernatant against commensal E coli P .01 C. However no modification of TNFa concentrations was observed in ileum of Sox9floxflox-vil-cre compared with littermate mice D.Both C3HHeN Submitted to MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-cre Mice Induced Fecal Dysbiosis Characterized by an Expansion of E coli Positively Correlated With Visceral HypersensitivityBased on measurement of the relative abundance of 21 microbial taxa in feces 2 distinct partial least-squares discriminant analysis PLS-DA were built to depict fecal microbial signature associated with MS A and Paneth cell depletion in Sox9floxflox-vil-cre B.

In this study we have not observed changes in ileal concentrations of other proinflammatory cytokines known to impair Paneth cells such as IFNg.On the other hand the ileal increase of TNFa was observed only in the MS model but neither in Sox9floxflox-vil-Cre mice nor in mice receiving E coli by oral gavage excluding a direct role of TNFa in the visceral hypersensitivity observed in these different models.Thereafter we undertook to clarify the link between the Paneth cell functional defect namely the decrease of lyso- zyme expression in the MS model and the associated E coli expansion.

Fifteen days of lysozyme treatment of MS mice prevented fecal increase of E coli P  .001 A.However increase of TNFa in ileum of MS mice was not prevented by lysozyme treatment P  .05 B.Lysozyme treatment also prevented visceral hypersen- sitivity in 50-day-old adult MS mice P  .0045 at 0.04 mL P  .0001 at 0.06 mL P  .0001 at 0.08 mL C.Representative EMG recording is presented in Supplementary Figure 2A.

Indeed control mice receiving MS mouse dysbiotic microbiota by oral gavage were not able to maintain this microbiota and failed to develop anxiety-like behavior observed in MS mice.Interestingly even though mouse gut microbiota is strain-specific E coli expansion was observed in both tested models of Paneth cell deficiency MS in C3HHeN mice and genetic engineered intestinal depletion of Sox9 in C57BL6 strain.
