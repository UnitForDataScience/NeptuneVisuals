after 15 days of gavage streptomycin- resistant e coli represented 90 of fecal e coli as enumerated on chromid agar plates supplemented or not with 50 mgml streptomycin.variance in selected fecal microbial taxa abundances discriminated daily e coli-fed mice compared with vehicle-treated mice a. as expected e coli was the most important contributor responsible for difference observed in microbial profile of mice b. increase of relative abundance of fecal e coli was observed on mice after oral gavage by plating fecal pellet on chromid agar p .0007 c and by quantitative pcr p .017 d.the resulting dysbiosis in favor of e coli induced visceral hypersensitivity in response to colorectal disten- sion at the volume of 0.04 ml p 14 .017 and 0.06 mlfigure 6. fecal microbiota inflammation and visceral sensitivity analysis on adult mice receiving commensal e coli by oral gavage.

e coli expansion due to paneth cell number and function defects has also been observed independently of mouse genetic background in a model of gvhd.those observations highlight the major role of paneth cells in controlling e coli intestinal population independently of mouse strain and mouse antimicrobial repertoire.taken together the results of this study showed thatboth ms mice and sox9floxflox-vil-cre mice exhibit fecal e coli expansion and visceral hypersensitivity 2 oral gavage of conventional mice with e coli induces fecal e coli increase and visceral hypersensitivity and 3 lysozyme oral treatment of ms mice can prevent e coli fecal expansion and visceral hypersensitivity.

more generally auc of emg activity in response to increasing volumes of distension was higher in mice submitted to e coli oral gavage compared with vehicle-treated mice p .002 f.e coli gavage did not trigger ileal inflammation as tnfa ileal concentrations remained unchanged after e coli gavages g and no modification of ifng was observed data not shown.oral treatment of young ms mice with lysozyme prevented stress-induced e coli expansion and associated visceral hypersensitivity in adultswe wondered if an oral supplementation of ms mice with lysozyme could conversely prevent e coliexpansion and visceral hypersensitivity.

nevertheless lzm treatment results in preventing e coli overgrowth and visceral hypersensitivity induced by ms. interestingly lysozyme oral treatment prevented ms- induced e coli expansion but not tnfa increase in ileum suggesting that inflammation driven by tnfa release may be responsible for paneth cell defect and e coli expansion and not the opposite ie e coli overwhelming inducing in- testinal inflammation.

increase of e coli abundance was indeed observed by plating fecal pellet on selective agar in feces of mice submitted to ms c p .0002 and sox9 oxflox-vil-cre mice d p .042.e coli increase in ms and sox9floxflox-vil-cre positively correlated with high auc of emg attesting of visceral hypersensitivity e and f.e coli gavages induced fecal dysbiosis associated with visceral hypersensitivity without inflammationby comparing key microbial features vip previously identified as important in discrimination of mouse microbiota according to their antimicrobial activity we noted that e coli expansion was observed in both mouse models ms and sox9floxflox-vil-cre mice.

defects in paneth cell granule composition including lysozyme observed in cd1d-- mice result in e coli expansion not only in small intestine content but also in feces.in themouse graft-versus-host disease gvhd model inducing paneth cell defect in number and function a reduced diversity of the fecal microbiota is observed as well as an overwhelming expansion of e coli leading to gvhd mice death due to e coli-induced septicemia.finally dithizone- induced paneth cell depletion is detrimental to host defense against e coli infection in rat neonatal small intestine.

fecal microbial signature associated with ms consisted in an increase of the relative abundances of methanobrevibacter smithii p .028 ruminococcus gnavus p .043 eubacterium hallii p .18 and e coli p .1 associated with a decrease of the roseburia at the genus level p .36 c supplementary figure 6. increase of the relative abundance of bacter- oides fragilis p .0014 and e coli p .041 d in sox9floxflox-vil-cre mice was accompanied by a global increase of bacteria mainly belonging to bacteroidetes phylum bacteroides spp and prevotella spp p .05 and p .019 respectively and enterococcus spp and a decrease of relative abundance of bifidobacterium spp d supplementary figure 7.among the main contributors to dysbiosis vip1 fecal e coli expansion represents a common feature asso- ciated with ms and paneth cell defect in sox9floxflox-vil-cre mice.

fifteen days of oral gavage on conventional mice with autochthonous e coli induced fecal e coli expansion and visceral hypersensitivity showing that the e coli expansion is responsible for the visceral hypersensitivity occurrence.

prevention of e coli expansion by lzm treatment is either the result of lysozyme lzm antimicrobial activity against e coli or indirectly a modifi- cation of microbiota composition repressing e coli expan- sion.

c counting of fecal e coli colonies on chromid coli selective plates after 15 days of oral gavage with e coli n 11-12 mice per group.

interestingly previous works showed that ms induces microbiota dysbiosis in favor of coliforms in rats and monkeys.finally in 8-week-old rats ms induced micro- biota dysbiosis characterized by reduced diversity and higher representation of proteobacteria phylum including enterobacteriaceae family.all these data strongly sup- port the role of paneth cells in control of e coli population in small and large intestine.e coli expansion in our models of paneth cell defect ms and sox9floxflox-vil-cre was observed without a broader microbiota overgrowth supplementary figure 8. this is in agreement with previous studies showing that paneth cell defect induced microbial dysbiosis occurs without microbiota overgrowth.interestingly in both models ms and sox9floxflox-vil-cre a strong positive correlation was observed between e coli fecal cfu and auc of emg attesting of visceral sensitivity.
