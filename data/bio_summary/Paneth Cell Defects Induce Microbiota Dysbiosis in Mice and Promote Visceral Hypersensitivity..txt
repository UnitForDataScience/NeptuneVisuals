E coli expansion due to Paneth cell number and function defects has also been observed independently of mouse genetic background in a model of GVHD.Those observations highlight the major role of Paneth cells in controlling E coli intestinal population independently of mouse strain and mouse antimicrobial repertoire.Taken together the results of this study showed thatboth MS mice and Sox9floxflox-vil-Cre mice exhibit fecal E coli expansion and visceral hypersensitivity 2 oral gavage of conventional mice with E coli induces fecal E coli increase and visceral hypersensitivity and 3 lysozyme oral treatment of MS mice can prevent E coli fecal expansion and visceral hypersensitivity.

More generally AUC of EMG activity in response to increasing volumes of distension was higher in mice submitted to E coli oral gavage compared with vehicle-treated mice P .002 F.E coli gavage did not trigger ileal inflammation as TNFa ileal concentrations remained unchanged after E coli gavages G and no modification of IFNg was observed data not shown.Oral Treatment of Young MS Mice With Lysozyme Prevented Stress-induced E coli Expansion and Associated Visceral Hypersensitivity in AdultsWe wondered if an oral supplementation of MS mice with lysozyme could conversely prevent E coliexpansion and visceral hypersensitivity.

Increase of E coli abundance was indeed observed by plating fecal pellet on selective agar in feces of mice submitted to MS C P .0002 and Sox9 oxflox-vil-cre mice D P .042.E coli increase in MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-cre positively correlated with high AUC of EMG attesting of visceral hypersensitivity E and F.E coli Gavages Induced Fecal Dysbiosis Associated With Visceral Hypersensitivity Without InflammationBy comparing key microbial features VIP previously identified as important in discrimination of mouse microbiota according to their antimicrobial activity we noted that E coli expansion was observed in both mouse models MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-cre mice.

Nevertheless LZM treatment results in preventing E coli overgrowth and visceral hypersensitivity induced by MS. Interestingly lysozyme oral treatment prevented MS- induced E coli expansion but not TNFa increase in ileum suggesting that inflammation driven by TNFa release may be responsible for Paneth cell defect and E coli expansion and not the opposite ie E coli overwhelming inducing in- testinal inflammation.

Defects in Paneth cell granule composition including lysozyme observed in Cd1d-- mice result in E coli expansion not only in small intestine content but also in feces.In themouse graft-versus-host disease GVHD model inducing Paneth cell defect in number and function a reduced diversity of the fecal microbiota is observed as well as an overwhelming expansion of E coli leading to GVHD mice death due to E coli-induced septicemia.Finally dithizone- induced Paneth cell depletion is detrimental to host defense against E coli infection in rat neonatal small intestine.

Fifteen days of oral gavage on conventional mice with autochthonous E coli induced fecal E coli expansion and visceral hypersensitivity showing that the E coli expansion is responsible for the visceral hypersensitivity occurrence.

Prevention of E coli expansion by LZM treatment is either the result of lysozyme LZM antimicrobial activity against E coli or indirectly a modifi- cation of microbiota composition repressing E coli expan- sion.

More generally AUC of EMGsmaller antimicrobial activity of fecal supernatant against commensal E coli P .01 C. However no modification of TNFa concentrations was observed in ileum of Sox9floxflox-vil-cre compared with littermate mice D.Both C3HHeN Submitted to MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-cre Mice Induced Fecal Dysbiosis Characterized by an Expansion of E coli Positively Correlated With Visceral HypersensitivityBased on measurement of the relative abundance of 21 microbial taxa in feces 2 distinct partial least-squares discriminant analysis PLS-DA were built to depict fecal microbial signature associated with MS A and Paneth cell depletion in Sox9floxflox-vil-cre B.

In this study we have not observed changes in ileal concentrations of other proinflammatory cytokines known to impair Paneth cells such as IFNg.On the other hand the ileal increase of TNFa was observed only in the MS model but neither in Sox9floxflox-vil-Cre mice nor in mice receiving E coli by oral gavage excluding a direct role of TNFa in the visceral hypersensitivity observed in these different models.Thereafter we undertook to clarify the link between the Paneth cell functional defect namely the decrease of lyso- zyme expression in the MS model and the associated E coli expansion.

Interestingly previous works showed that MS induces microbiota dysbiosis in favor of coliforms in rats and monkeys.Finally in 8-week-old rats MS induced micro- biota dysbiosis characterized by reduced diversity and higher representation of Proteobacteria phylum including Enterobacteriaceae family.All these data strongly sup- port the role of Paneth cells in control of E coli population in small and large intestine.E coli expansion in our models of Paneth cell defect MS and Sox9floxflox-vil-Cre was observed without a broader microbiota overgrowth Supplementary Figure 8.
