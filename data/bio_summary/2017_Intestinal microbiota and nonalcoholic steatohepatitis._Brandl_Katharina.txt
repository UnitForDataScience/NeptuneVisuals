Increased intestinal inflammation is also present in patients with NAFLD as exemplified by intestinal tight junction disruption changes in immune cell populations and increased intestinal cytokine levels 35.Bacterial metabolitesAs diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy extensive efforts have been made to find non- invasive sensitive methods to detect early stages of disease and to stage progressive NASH.

Interestingly 5-ASA treatment also significantly improved intestinal permeability and reduced liver steatosis 34 further providing evidence for a link between intestinal inflammation changes in gut permeability and progression of liver disease.

Increased levels of microbial products ethanol and an altered bile acid profile have been detected in patients with NASH.Table 1Summary of key pathways involving the gut-liver axis important for NASHReceptorType of deficiencyMechanismModel usedEffectRef Pattern recognition receptorsTLR4Global deficiencyTLR4MD2 mediated signals contribute to liver pathology via NADPH- dependent lipid-peroxidation and oxidative stressTLR5TLR5 deficiency in hepatocytesLoss of hepatocyte TLR5 potentiates high-fat diet induced pro-inflammatorygene expression via Nod-like receptor C4 inflammasomeMCD dietDetrimental26MCD diet HFDProtective28TLR9TLR9 deficiency in lysosome producing cells neutrophils and KCsBile acid receptorsPro-inflammatory response via TLR9 activationHFDDetrimental27FXRIntestine specific deficiencyReduced triglyceride accumulation due to low ceramide synthesis genes29Gut-restricted FXR activation reduces diet-induced weight gain inflammation hepatic glucose production and enhances thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue 30HFDControversial29 30TGR5Global deficiencyAntilipogenic effects of intestinal FXR agonist are TGR5 dependentHFDPart of the protective effect ofthe intestinal specific FXR agonist is reduced in TGR5 deficient mice30HFD high-fat diet TLR Toll-like Receptor MCD methionine and choline deficient diet NASH nonalcoholic steatohepatitis FXR farnesoid X receptor TGR Takeda-G-protein coupled receptor 5 KC Kupffer cell

We will also preferentially focus on human studies although mechanistic studies require rodent experiments.Intestinal microbiota changes in patients with NASHVarious liver diseases including NASH are associated with intestinal dysbiosis 9.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and toll-like receptor signaling in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Presumably lipopolysaccharide LPS or endotoxin derived from the gut microflora translocates via a dysfunctional gut barrier to the portal vein and liver thereby inducing an inflammatory response through activation of inflammatory cells in the liver.

TLR5 expressed on hepatocytes plays therefore an important role in the protection of the liver against diet-induced liver disease 28 Table 1.It is not clear however if altered permeability is cause or consequence of endotoxin exposure.

Gut-derived products that contribute to NASH progressionIntestinal products reaching the liver can have multi-faceted effects on liver physiology.

As a consequence serum endotoxin levels were significantly higher and may be responsible for liver injury in these patients.
