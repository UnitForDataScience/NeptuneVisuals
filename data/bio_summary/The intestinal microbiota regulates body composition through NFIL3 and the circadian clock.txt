In T cells and liver cells REV-ERBa binds to a consensus sequence in the Nfil3 gene locus and represses transcription resulting in a rhythmic diurnal Nfil3 expression pattern 6 10.

Comparison of Nfil3 expression levels across a circadian cycle in wild-type germ-free and conventional mice revealed that the microbiota is required for maximal Nfil3 expression and thus governs the amplitude of Nfil3 transcriptional rhythms Fig.

Thus microbiota regulation of Nfil3 expression is REV-ERBa-dependent and the microbiota elevates Nfil3 expression by repressing Rev-erba expression.We next sought to determine how bacterial signals are relayed to the epithelial circadian clock to regulate Rev-erba and Nfil3 expression.

Nfil3 transcription is controlled by the circadian clock 9 and accordingly Nfil3 transcript abundance oscillated diurnally in an enriched population of small intestinal epithelial cells acquired by laser capture microdissection Fig.

We quantified Rev-erba and Nfil3 transcripts in epithelial cells from Myd88-- mice and wild-type littermates at Zeitgeber time ZT4 which is when Nfil3 expression is near-peak in conventional mice Fig.

While epithelial MyD88 was dispensable for microbiota-induced alterations in Rev-erba and Nfil3 expression Myd88 expression in a CD11c cell population which includes some dendritic cells was required for maximal repression of Rev-erba and induction of Nfil3 Fig.

The fact that Nfil3 expression was higher in Rag1-- mice than in conventional wild-type mice is likely due to the elevated bacterial loads as well as aberrant expansion of ILC3 in the small intestines of these mice 18 and indicates that T and B cells are not required for induction of Nfil3 expression.

Nfil3 transcription oscillates diurnally in intestinal epithelial cells and the amplitude of the circadian oscillation is controlled by the microbiota through group 3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3 STAT3 and the epithelial cell circadian clock.

This suggested that REV-ERBa governs circadian rhythmicity in Nfil3 expression and that the microbiota might induce Nfil3 expression by repressing Rev-erba expression.

Rev-erba and Nfil3 expression were not markedly altered by monoassociation with the Gram-positive species Enterococcus faecalis or with the Gram-negative non-flagellated species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron suggesting that Nfil3 expression is selectively activated by Gram-negative motile bacteria.
