These natural biofilm sys- tems mimic the species composition of the environment more closely than do model engineered biofilm systems.Experimental multispecies biofilm model systems 45Defined engineered multispecies biofilm systemsSuch biofilms have generally been designed to achieve1 high reproducibility 2 short experimental time- frames 3 coexistence of all member species 4 the ability to track individual population dynamics and 5 the capacity for genetic manipulation and the application of general 'omics' approaches Fig.

Additionally the culture conditions used in the laboratory may not reflect the environments of the selected species in terms of temperature optima and range of variation nutrient source UV exposure etc.Thus domesticated strains may no longer behave in the same way as their wild counterparts Palkova 2004.Defined natural multispecies biofilm systemsTo overcome limitations associated with the use of labo- ratory strains in multispecies biofilm systems organisms that are isolated directly from the environment of interest can be adopted instead.

S. rhizophila M. oxy- dans and P. amylolyticus formed low amounts of biofilm on their own while X. retroflexus was the only species capable of significant biofilm formation on its own.

Giv- en that some defined model biofilm communities show cooperative behaviours in terms of biofilm biomass pro- duction as well as enhanced stress tolerance and metabolism it is likely that these more complex commu- nities show similar or perhaps even greater levels of benefits for the community.There are nonetheless challenges associated with these naturally established multispecies communities Fig.

2010.Undefined engineered multispecies biofilm model systemsThe in situ studies of native communities such as AMD and microbial mats offer the most direct relevant infor- mation regarding biofilm community ecology and physiol- ogy.

In those studies the granular biofilm development was classified into a five-step process resembling the typical surface- associated biofilm formation.

Metabolomics has also been successfully employed to investigate biofilm development Orphan and House 2009 Louie et al.
