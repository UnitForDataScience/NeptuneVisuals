Here we used the state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct microbial population genomes directly from a single FMT donorand tracked the occurrence of resulting metagenome- assembled genomes MAGs in two FMT recipients up to 8 weeks.MethodsSample collection preparation and sequencingWe collected a total of 10 fecal samples four samples from a single donor D a 30-year-old male and three samples from each of the two recipients R01 a 23- year-old male and R02 a 32-year-old female before and after FMT.

a The 92 MAGs and their level of detection in four donor samples four inner circles as well as two recipients R01 and R02 before FMT pre-FMT 4 weeks after FMT W4 and 8 weeks after FMT W8.

For instance a recent meta- analysis of 50 peer-reviewed FMT case reports reported 38 potentially transfer-related adverse effects in FMT patients in 35 studies including fever sore throat vomiting abdom- inal pain bowel perforation rhinorrhea transient relapse of UC and CDI and in one case death due to temporary systemic immune response to the applied bacteria Besides bacteria FMT can transfer viruses archaea and fungi as well as other agents of the donor host such as colonocytes which may affect the recipient's biology in unexpected ways.

However we lack a sufficient understanding of which microbial populations successfully colonize the recipient gut and the widely used approaches to study the microbial ecology of FMT experiments fail to provide enough resolution to identify populations that are likely responsible for FMT-derived benefits.Methods We used shotgun metagenomics together with assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes MAGs from fecal samples of a single FMT donor.

Recipient samples originated from time points pre-FMT 4 weeks after FMT and 8 weeks after FMT while four samples from the donor were collected on four separate days 2 weeks prior to the transplant- ation.

Similarity percentage analysis SIMPER of the taxonomic profiles suggested that the two recipients were 79.60 similar after FMT and that Bacteroides was responsible for the largest fraction 32.42 of difference between recipient samples of pre-FMT and 4 weeks after FMT.

In addition taxonomic annotation of a large fraction of MAGs in our study did not resolve to a genus name which suggests that bacterial populations that have not yet been characterized in culture collections may be playing important roles in FMT treatments.Although a substantial number of studies report success- ful medical outcomes of FMT experiments  a complete understanding of this procedure from the perspective of microbial ecology is still lacking.

Bacterial populations with high-vertical transmission rates had lower number of genes related to sporulation These observations suggest that excluding non-spore forming bacteria may decrease the efficacy of FMT therapies dueto limited colonization efficiency and deeper insights into the functional basis of microbial colonization require further study.ConclusionsUsing bacterial populations associated with positive health outcomes and that harbor high colonization properties may result in more effective therapies com- pared to cleansing all but spore-forming bacteria to avoid the transfer of pathogens in FMT experiments.

We then used metagenomic mapping to track the occurrence and distribution patterns of donor MAGs in two FMT recipients.Results Our analyses revealed that 22 of the 92 highly complete bacterial MAGs that we identified from the donor successfully colonized and remained abundant in two recipients for at least 8 weeks.
