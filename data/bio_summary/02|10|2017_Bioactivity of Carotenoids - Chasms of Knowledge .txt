More recent studies havesuggested that certain metabolites and not necessarily the native compounds may be the mostbiologically active ones such as certain apocarotenals originating following enzymatic cleavageand other more polar compounds acting as more suitable electrophiles to react with transcriptionfactors such as nuclear factor kappa-B NF-kB and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 Nrf2.In addition it appears that questions of dosing are likewise crucial as may be interactions of non-provitamin A carotenoids and their derivatives with retinoic acid receptors RAR or retinoid Xreceptors RXR.

knock-out models higher availability of metabolite standards andimproved analytical capabilities will contribute to solve some of these persistent puzzles.AcknowledgementsThe insights obtained during participation in the EU-COST Actions Positive FA-1403 andEurocaroten CA-15136 are much appreciated.Conflict of interestThe author is also Editor-in-Chief of this journal.References1 Tang G. 2014 Vitamin A value of plant food provitamin A - evaluated by the stable isotope technologies.Int J Vitam Nutr Res 84 Suppl 1 25-29.2 Tanumihardjo S.A.

free radical quenching may be responsible for the proposed healtheffects but also and perhaps especially effects on gene expressions such as via altering cellulartranscription factors linked to inflammation and oxidative stress as reviewed by Kaulmann and Bohn16.

It rather appears that our understandingof carotenoid bioavailability and bioactivity especially regarding the active compounds and possiblydose-related aspects is incomplete It can be hypothesized that carotenoids administered at highdoses supplements may override the body's metabolism capacity increasing the ratio of nativecompounds to metabolites resulting in more pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory conditions.Indeed several studies have suggested that b-carotene oxygenase 12 BCO12 cleavagemetabolites due to their enhanced electrophilic properties with improved binding ability to cysteineresidues of NF-kB and Nrf2 and higher solubility in the cytosol are better alterators of thesepathways resulting in anti-inflammatory effects and stimulating the bodies' own antioxidant system17.

27 have suggested that lycopene metabolitessuch as apo-15-lycopenoids show vitamin A - like behaviour as they may activate retinoid X receptorRXR and retinoic acid receptor RAR 28 29 30.

Lowerconcentrations possibly covering the lowerphysiological range may even reduce Nrf2 translocation effects for NF-kB are less clear.

Most recognized for theiradverse effects on smokers both the ATBC 9 and the CARET trial 10 in which b-carotene wasco- administered at high daily doses of 20 mg with 50 mg a-tocopherol and 30 mg with 25000 IUvitamin A respectively for several years had to be discontinued due to increased lung-cancermortality.
