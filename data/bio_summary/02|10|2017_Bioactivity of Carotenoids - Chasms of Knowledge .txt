Though the mechanismsof action remained unclear at the time it was speculated that carotenoid antioxidant capacityinvolving quenching of free radicals such as of lipid peroxides was likely to be associated with theobserved effects 7.67Intervention trials with carotenoid supplements - hard endpointsThese positive findings and related antioxidant activity seen in many in vitro trials 8 sparked anumber of large-scale supplementation trials especially with b-carotene.

Potential interrelation between carotenoid exposure oxidative stress inflammation and toxicological relevant pathwayspattern fill.Higher carotenoid concentrations depending on carotenoid type organism bioavailability etc.

It rather appears that our understandingof carotenoid bioavailability and bioactivity especially regarding the active compounds and possiblydose-related aspects is incomplete It can be hypothesized that carotenoids administered at highdoses supplements may override the body's metabolism capacity increasing the ratio of nativecompounds to metabolites resulting in more pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory conditions.Indeed several studies have suggested that b-carotene oxygenase 12 BCO12 cleavagemetabolites due to their enhanced electrophilic properties with improved binding ability to cysteineresidues of NF-kB and Nrf2 and higher solubility in the cytosol are better alterators of thesepathways resulting in anti-inflammatory effects and stimulating the bodies' own antioxidant system17.

Also in this respect more is known for other phytochemicals such as for polyphenols32 but little on carotenoids.When highlighting potential dose effects it is also important to stress out inter-individualdifferences in dose-responses possibly related to genetic differences such as single nucleotidepolymorphisms SNPs altering carotenoid metabolism and bioavailability 33 34.

knock-out models higher availability of metabolite standards andimproved analytical capabilities will contribute to solve some of these persistent puzzles.AcknowledgementsThe insights obtained during participation in the EU-COST Actions Positive FA-1403 andEurocaroten CA-15136 are much appreciated.Conflict of interestThe author is also Editor-in-Chief of this journal.References1 Tang G. 2014 Vitamin A value of plant food provitamin A - evaluated by the stable isotope technologies.Int J Vitam Nutr Res 84 Suppl 1 25-29.2 Tanumihardjo S.A.
