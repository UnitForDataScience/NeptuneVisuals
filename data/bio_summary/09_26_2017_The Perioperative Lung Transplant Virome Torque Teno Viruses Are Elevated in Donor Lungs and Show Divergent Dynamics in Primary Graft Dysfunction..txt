Consequently donor lungs are markedly abnormal with regard to virome populations even before transplantation.Conversely in serum quantities of TTV immediately after reperfusion median 35 530 copiesmL were lower thanA7B665544332Donor BAL Recipient BAL Healthy BALRecipient SerumHealthy Serumn  41C7654n  39n  8n  35p  0.001rho  0.548GroupControl PGDn  46n  1134567Log10 TTV Copiesml Donor BALFigure 1 Torque teno virus TTV levels in lung transplant donors recipients and healthy adults.

In this study we investigated lung TTV levels at time of transplantation by quantifying TTV genomes in donor BAL and in recipient postreperfusion BAL and serum Figure 1.Copies of TTV DNA per milliliter of acellular BAL varied up to 10 000-fold in both donor and recipient samplesFigure 1.

Although absolute levels of TTV did not distinguish PGD cases from controls changes in TTV levels during the perioperative period were significantly associated with PGD.Finding high levels of TTV in donor lungs was unex- pected.

Future studies will be needed to deter- mine whether lung TTV levels increase in critically ill patients generally or if high levels are specifically associ- ated with brain death andor corticosteroid or other donor treatments.TTV levels increased from pre- to posttransplant lung samples but the magnitude of increase was lower in PGD cases than in controls.

There was a positive trend cor- relating TTV levels in BAL and serum of LTRs immedi- ately after transplantation p  0.061 Spearman's q  0.303 Spearman rank correlation test Figure S1.The high levels of TTV DNA found in donor lungs prior to transplantation were surprising given that donors are selected because they lack overt lung disease.

When evaluated as absolute levels at a single time point neither donor pretransplant nor postreperfu- sion BAL TTV levels correlated with PGD p  0.89 and p  0.82 respectively Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Con- sequently PGD is associated with a significantly lower rise in TTV levels during the peritransplant period.Association of TTV levels and differences in mRNA expression in the lungGene set enrichment analysis in BAL cells from this cohort of patients previously identified several inflammasome and innate immune pathways for which perioperative change in expression correlated with PGD 15.

Donor BAL obtained prior to lung procurement had a median of 670 600 TTV copiesmL which was 100- fold higher than TTV levels in healthy adult BAL samples median 6631 p  0.0026 Wilcoxon rank sum test.
