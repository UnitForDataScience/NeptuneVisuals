bal bronchoalveolar lavage pgd primary graft dysfunction ttv torque teno virus.association between ttv dynamics and pgd reflects a relationship distinct from previously identified mecha- nisms linked to host gene expression patterns.the range of ttv levels in serum of our healthy controls was similar to previous reports 67-70 but our postreperfusion serum levels were significantly lower figure 1. these levels immediately after transplant con- trast with studies showing elevated blood ttv levels of chronic transplant recipients who were immunosup- pressed 37-39. a recent report however described decreased ttv levels at day 7 in kidney-pancreas trans- plant recipients receiving anti-thymocyte globulin atg that were ascribed to lymphocytolytic properties of atg on mononuclear cells believed to support ttv replication 61. only slight decreases were reported at day 7 inthose receiving basiliximab which is not lymphocytolytic but prevents t cell proliferation.

in addition corticosteroids are generally given to organ donors to modulate inflammation after brain death and corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression could be another reason for the high ttv levels in donors because host immune function is thought to control virus replica- tion 343864. future studies will be needed to deter- mine whether lung ttv levels increase in critically ill patients generally or if high levels are specifically associ- ated with brain death andor corticosteroid or other donor treatments.ttv levels increased from pre- to posttransplant lung samples but the magnitude of increase was lower in pgd cases than in controls.

unexpectedly ttv dna levels were elevated 100-fold in donor lungs compared with healthy adults p  0.0026. although absolute ttv levels did not differ by pgd status pgd cases showed a smaller increase in ttv levels from before to after transplant than did control recipients p  0.041. metagenomic sequencing revealed mainly ttv and bacteriophages of respiratory tract bacteria but noviral taxa distinguished pgd cases from controls.

although absolute levels of ttv did not distinguish pgd cases from controls changes in ttv levels during the perioperative period were significantly associated with pgd.finding high levels of ttv in donor lungs was unex- pected.

an inflammatory environment develops within theabbas et allung after donor brain death and is perpetuated after reperfusion by recruitment of lymphocytes macrophages and neutrophils 36-12. activated immune cells and reactive oxygen species generated during ischemia- reperfusion are thought to injure lung endothelium and epithelium 3. host genetic variation in genes involved in oxidant stress responses and innate immunity correlate with risk of pgd 1314. pgd has also been associated with inflammasome activation pattern recognition recep- tor signaling and complement activation within the allo- graft 15-17. these studies raise the possibility of a microbial contribution to pathogenesis.culture-based and molecular clinical assays have associ- ated specific bacteria fungi and community-acquired res- piratory viruses with lung transplantation outcomes such as the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome bos 18-24. studies using high-throughput metage- nomic sequencing have demonstrated that lung bacterial fungal and viral communities are aberrant in lungs of ltrs compared with healthy controls 222526. ltrs have decreased bacterial diversity increased bacterial load outgrowths of pathogens and presence of atypical species 22252728. one study linked metagenomic bacterial community features and bos 29.our group recently reported high levels of diverse torque teno viruses ttvs in acellular bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid from ltrs sampled from 1 mo to 10 years fol- lowing transplant 26. ttvs are small nonenveloped cir- cular negative-sense single-stranded dna eukaryotic cell viruses belonging to the anelloviridae family.

consequently donor lungs are markedly abnormal with regard to virome populations even before transplantation.conversely in serum quantities of ttv immediately after reperfusion median 35 530 copiesml were lower thana7b665544332donor bal recipient bal healthy balrecipient serumhealthy serumn  41c7654n  39n  8n  35p  0.001rho  0.548groupcontrol pgdn  46n  1134567log10 ttv copiesml donor balfigure 1 torque teno virus ttv levels in lung transplant donors recipients and healthy adults.
