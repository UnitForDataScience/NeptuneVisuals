aureus outbreak strain.

for each strain 10 ml of sterile tryptone soy broth tsb oxoid deutschland gmbh wesel germany was inoculated with 100 ll of the stock culture in a 100-ml erlenmeyer flask and incu- bated for 24 h at 37degc on an orbital shaker.

one swatch of each test strain was incubated in 1 ml tsb with tween-lecithin-histidine-sodium thiosulphate neutral- izer formulation per litre 30 g tween 80 03 g lecithin 1 g histidine 5 g sodium thiosulphate to inactivate the deter- gents for 10 min at 15degc and at 1 000 rpm in an incubation shaker.

for all tests a horizontal axis household washing machine miele w 5000 wps supertonic drum size 60 l was used.two contaminated swatches of each strain were included in each test run and each experiment was car- ried out six times.

as a general rule the outbreak strains in particular the outbreak strain of staph.
