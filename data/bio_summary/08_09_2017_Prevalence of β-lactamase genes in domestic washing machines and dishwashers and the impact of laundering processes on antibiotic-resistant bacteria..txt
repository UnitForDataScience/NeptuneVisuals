The level of bacterial reduction after laundering was80 for all Ps.

The production of b-lactamases is a fre-The use overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents have led to the development of resistances in bacteria and the natural selection of resistant strains.

The prepared DNA was amplified using the HotStarTaqr Master Mix Kit Qiagen and a mix of oligonucleotides and DNA probes labelled with different dyes.

The PCR mix contained 10 ll of a 29 HotStarTaqr Mastermix 7 ll of RNase-free water 1 ll of oligonucleotide mix oligonucleotide 4 lM probe 2 lM and 2 ll of the DNA template comprising a final volume of 20 ll.

The PCR was performed in a CFX96 Touchtm Real-Time PCR Detection System Bio-Rad Munich Ger- many using the following conditions 95degC for 15 min 40 cycles of denaturation 95degC 10 s annealing 60degC 20 s elongation 72degC 10 s and a final cycle at 30degC for 30 s. A sample was considered positive if it reached the threshold before cycle 40.

The PCR was performed in a LightCyclerr 20 Instrument Roche Diagnostics GmbH using the follow- ing conditions denaturation at 95degC 45 cycles of anneal- ing 60degC and elongation 72degC.PCR-positive samples were cultured on MacConkey agar Thermo Fisher Scientific Wesel Germany chromIDr ESBL agar bioM erieux NuEURrtingen Germany and in a thioglycolate broth Thermo Fisher Scientific containing meropenem trihydrate Sigma-Aldrich Tauf- kirchen Germany.

The second subcul- ture was centrifuged for 5 min at 47 G and the super- natant was discarded.

The pellet was resuspended in sterile 0154 M NaCl solution centrifuged 5 min at 47 G and decanted again.

The sterile swatches were submerged in the bacte- rial suspension for 10 min and were placed in sterile petri dishes and dried open for 2 h at 37degC.
