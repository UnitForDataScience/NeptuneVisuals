reported the ability of CML to modulate the intestinal microbiota in mouse models of IBD reporting modest effects in 246-trini- trobenzenesulfonic acid TNBS-treated mice and more Adam Fabisiak 1 Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Medicine Medical University of Lo'dz' Mazowiecka 68 92-215 Lodz Polandprominent effects in dextran sodium sulfate-treated DSS mice where CML maintained a ''healthy'' microbiological profile in the group while preventing weight loss.

Moreover the study revealed that weight change inversely correlated with food intake by mice consistent with metabolic changes associated with chronic consumption of CML supported by an in vitro study  in which CML impaired basal glucose uptake while enhancing lipid accumulation in adipocytes.Although the study helps elucidate how an MRP product influences the gut microbiota in inflamed and healthy mice it has some weaknesses which mostly can be attributed to the methodology employed in the studies on the micro- biota which due to the hundreds of variables measured and complex statistics employed is associated with standard errors of nearly the same magnitude as the means typical of in vivo microbiota studies complicating the reporting inter-individual variations.

The increasing incidence of IBD correlates with overall global industrialization which in turn corre- lates with the ''Western pattern diet'' .In this issue of Digestive Diseases and Sciences Jahdali et al.

As an example inflammatory bowel disease IBD possesses an established etiopathogenesis which comprises the genetic susceptibility and environ- mental factors associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota.
