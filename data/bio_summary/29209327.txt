in this regard in what ways does the microbiome impact the induction of icd in melanoma cells can particular microbes provide metabolic support for dc by removing toxic byproducts from the tumor microenvironment and how do microbe-derived metabolites themselves contribute to the metabolic milieu and its influenceon dc in the tumor microenvironment to what extent do immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment blunt dc function through regulation of metabolic pathways in these cells and how might altering the balance of these factors impact the abundance and diversity of the microbiota and its con- tribution to tumor-associated dc function collectively how do these factors influence the ability of dc to maintain the immune reactivity of t cells supported by checkpoint blockade therapy and how might dc-based therapies best be utilized in combina- torial approaches to induce antitumor t cell responses in patients who have not mounted natural responses to melanoma and are therefore currently poor candidates for treatment by checkpoint blockade these additional insights into dc immunoregulation in the context of melanoma coupled with ongoing technological advances that enable fine-tuned manipulation of dc function will arm scientists with the tools necessary to devise multifaceted approaches to overcome melanoma-imposed limitations on dc immunogenicity.

studies with other chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated either direct immunogenicity of killed melanoma cells or expressionrelease of icd biomarkers by melanoma cells exposed to a particular drug.

moreover as is already being done with some of the aforementioned inducers of melanoma icd investigat- ing how icd inducers might maximize the immunogenicity of exogenous dc either through ex vivo activation of these cells prior to immunization or through in vivo maintenance of their immunogenicity following infusion will likely improve the qual- ity and outcome of antitumor immune responses achieved by dc vaccines in future melanoma patients.interfering with immunosuppressive networks that impair the function of tumor- associated dcmelanoma-associated suppression of dc differentiationa significant body of evidence now exists demonstrating that tumor cells as well as other immunosuppressive cell populations that accumulate within the tumor microenvironment produce a variety of factors that alter the function of dc .

while selective targeting of such therapies specifically to tumor cells might be difficult for some cancer types and could lead to compromised function of dc and other immune cell populations that also rely on glycolysis for induction and maintenance of an activated phenotype the identification of tissue-specific genes in melanoma such as those involved in the melanin deposition pathway opens up the possibility of dna- based therapies in which sirnashrna expression is driven off of tissue-specific promoters active only in melanoma cells.

importantly data collected by the seer program show that melanoma incidence rates have continually risen the last 40 years  and a recent study projects melanoma incidence to continue increasing through at least 2022. in the u.s. alone annual costs for treatment and productivity losses associated with melanoma are near 3.3 billion .

dacarbazine is the only fda-approved chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of melanoma and though its use in isolation has not produced clinical benefits of major significance  it has been shown to promote the efficacy of a peptide-based vaccine for melanoma patients by enhancing repertoire diversity of melan-a-specific ctl   suggesting that the benefit of dacarbazine as part of combinatorial therapy may be derived from its induction of melanoma icd.

importantly although the presence of mature dc within tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes is a positive prognostic factor in melanoma patients immature dc are often enriched in both melanoma lesions and tumor-draining lymph nodes of hosts with progressive disease - thus highlighting the significance of dc matura- tion status as a key determinant of the immunologic control of melanoma progression.

this latter study has shown that the extent to which dc func- tion is altered by melanoma-derived factors is tumor-dependent such that lps-induced costimulatory molecule expression on splenic dc-stimulated ex vivo as well as on lung tissue-resident dc in mice harboring melanoma lung metastases is suppressed by the rapidly progressing b16-f1 melanoma but not the poorly tumorigenic d5.1g4 melanoma.

along with the diverse repertoire of icd inducers known to be effective against melanoma  ongoing efforts to refine the use of physi- cal modalities for tumor destruction will increase the array of weapons that exhibit not only direct antitumor activity but also the ability to boost immune reactivity against living melanoma cells thus doubling the impact of therapy.

alternatively macrophages capable of suppressing cd4 and cd8 t cell proliferation have been differentiated from monocytes cultured in conditioned media from both metastatic and non-metastatic human melanoma cell lines  and il-10 which can be secreted at high levels by melanomas  has been shown to promote the trans-differentiation of monocyte-derived dc into tolerogenic cd14 bdca3 macrophage-like cells simi- lar to those known to be enriched in melanoma metastases .

for instance local administration of a mix of cpg-b and gm-csf at the site of primary melanoma excision resulted in the maturation of both pdc and conventional dc as well as an increase in the frequency of cross-presenting bdca3 cd141 dc in sentinel lymph nodes and this approach enhanced the frequency of melanoma ag-specific cd8 t cells in these nodes and reduced the frequency of lymph node metastasis  .

therefore targeting glucose transporters and other enzymes such as ldha that are involved in glycolytic metabolism in melanoma cells is a potentially attractive therapeutic option for the treat- ment of melanoma.

although the ova ag in this model is more akin to a completely foreign oncoviral tumor ag this same study demonstrated in a humanized model of the b16-f10 murine melanoma cell line that tumor cells treated with doxorubicin and then injected into hla-a2 transgenic hosts also conferred significant protection against a subsequent challenge with live tumor cells .

others have also shown that lysates from oxaliplatin-treated b16-f10 melanoma cells were found to be immunogenic conferring par- tial protection against subsequent challenge with live tumor cells and this chemotherapy-driven immunogenicity was associated with markers of icd that include cell surface calreticulin andrelease of atp and hmgb1 .
