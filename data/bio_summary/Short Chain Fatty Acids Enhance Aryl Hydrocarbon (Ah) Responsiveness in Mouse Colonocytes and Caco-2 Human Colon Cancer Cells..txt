Butyrate increased expression of AhR protein in both cell lines and TCDD alone or in combination with butyrate decreased expression of AhR protein.

Like butyrate both propionate and acetate increased expression of Cyp1a1CYP1A1 in YAMC and Caco-2 cells and similar results were observed for expression of Cyp1b1CYP1B1 in both cell lines Fig.

Thus acetate propionate and butyrate the major SCFAs generated by microbial fermentation of fiber in the gut enhanced basal and AhR ligand-induced expression of Cyp1a1CYP1A1in both Caco-2 and YAMC cells and enhancement of ligand-induced Cyp1b1CYP1B1 was primarily observed in Caco-2 cells.HDAC inhibitors enhance expression of Ah-responsive genes.

The effects of HDAC inhibitors on ligand-induced CYP1A1 resulted in decreased expression in aerodigestive epithelial cells and increased expression in colon epithelial cells and fibroblasts-.

Initial studies with butyrate demonstrated that this compound significantly increased expression of Ah-responsivegenes such as Cyp1a1CYP1A1 inYAMC mouse colonocytes and Caco-2 human colon cancer cell lines.

These results demonstrate SCFA-AhR ligand interactions inYAMC and Caco-2 cells where SCFAs synergistically enhance basal and ligand-induced expression of AhR-responsive genes.The aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR was initially identified as the hepatic intracellular protein that bound with high affinity to 2378-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD a highly toxic industrial by-product.

The AhR partners with the AhR nuclear translocator Arnt to form a nuclear heterodimer that binds with cis-acting xeno- biotic response element XREs in target gene promoters to induce expression of Ah-responsive genes such as CYP1A1 .

The identification of health-promoting compounds as AhR ligands has spurred research on the development and applications of AhR-active chemicals for chemotherapeutic applications.The AhR plays a particularly important role in maintaining gastrointestinal health and several studies show that AhR expression in subsets of gut epithelial cells are important for bacterial resistance gut inflammation and integrity and this has been associated with induction of T regulatory Treg cells FoxP3 and interleukin-22-.

Since microbiota simultaneously produce both AhR ligands and SCFAs we used human Caco-2 anticancer cells and mouse YMAC colonocytes as models to investigate the interaction of SCFAs and AhR ligands and their effects on Ah-responsive gene expression.

Values for each gene were normalized to expression levels of TATA-binding protein TBP.
