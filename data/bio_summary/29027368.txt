Heterologous expression of fluorescent proteins remains one of the most useful and common tools for bacterial imaging Olenych et al.

This approach results in higher labelling stability and speci- ficity of live single cells compared with externally added dyes allows prolonged time-lapse imaging and circum- vents the need for exogenous dye internalization.Currently a broad selection of fluorescent proteins with varying fluorescence emission spectra and properties is available due to continuous efforts aimed at expanding the spectral range and improving their brightness and pho- tostability Olenych et al.

For example the green fluorescent protein GFP isolated from the Aequorea vic- toria jellyfish was the first fluorescent protein to be discov- ered and subsequently cloned in various live bacterial cells Chalfie et al.

At the same time a new group of fluorescent proteins with other fluorescence emission spectra and efficient maturation at 37degC has been discovered in reef corals and sea anemones includ- ing the monomeric red spectrum protein mCherry Shaner et al.
