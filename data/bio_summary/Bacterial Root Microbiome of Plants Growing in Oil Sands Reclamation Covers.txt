Rarefaction curves values and Simpson diversity were also generated using Mothur2 3 sequences and 13107 unique OTUs 3 dissimilarity across 120 endophytic and 120 rhizosphere bacterial community samples.The bacterial community consisted of 19 different phyla however for most bacterial communities analyzed only 4 different phyla represented at least 80 of the profile.

In an attempt to unravel the root associated bacterial microbiome of plants growing in reclamation soils we used 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing to characterize endophytic and rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with two plant species in one of the Athabasca oil sands reclamation sites.Illumina MiSeq of PCR amplicons and sequence analyses revealed that both endophytic and rhizosphere bacterial profiles varied considerably across the different sampling locations.

During land reclamation activities no soil or seed inoculation was conducted hence bacterial profiles in all rhizo-compartments studied here corresponded to naturally occurring indigenous communities.Previous studies     suggested that plant factors play a dominating role in the endophytic community composition and bacterial communities vary between plant species.

In addition although soil physical and chemical proprieties indicated differences betweensampling locations  no significant strong correlations were observed between the most abundant bacterial endophyte phyla and soil chemical parameters Supplementary Table S2.

This cluster also included a group of sweet clover associated rhizosphere bacterial profiles mainly differentiated from other samples within the cluster by the abundance of Stenotrophomonas 9.1.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here provides new insights on plant microbe interactions in reclamation sites as most previous studies have focused on the microbial communities in tailing ponds   and on the overall soil microbial biomass in oil sands reclamation sites  .

Here rhizosphere soil samples differentiated from its respective endophytic bacterial communities as previously reported in the literature    .

Our results suggest that bacterial endophytic communities of plants growing in land reclamation systems are a subset of the rhizosphere community and selection is driven by plant factors.Keywords oil sands land reclamation rhizosphere bacteria endophytic bacteria 16S rRNA gene sequencing NGS analysisINTRODUCTIONSoil microbial communities represent the greatest known reservoir of biological diversity  .

Within endophytic communities 532 OTUs were unique for clover plants and 870 for barley.Similar to Venn diagram PCoA also indicated differences between bacterial communities .
