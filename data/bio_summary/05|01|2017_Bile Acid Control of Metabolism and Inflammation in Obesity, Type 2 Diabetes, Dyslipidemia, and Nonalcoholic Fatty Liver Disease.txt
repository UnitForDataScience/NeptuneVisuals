An important unresolved question is whether through treating with metabolically stable highly active synthetic BA analogues interfering permanently with the FXR signaling pathway whose functions differ in fasting and fed condi- tions and BA synthesis which is submitted to circadian fluctuations might in the long term induce unwanted effects.Based on existing preclinical data and clinical use of BAS it appears that an orally administered inhibitor of intestinal FXR would be preferential to improve glucose and choles- terol metabolism whereas a liver-targeted FXR agonist would improve liver function and fibrosis.Caution should also be taken when translating data from preclinical murine models to humans because BA pool modulation affects the hydrophobicity index differently in mice vs humans and mice produce the FXR antagonist TbMCA which is absent in humans.

In humans FGF19 is also produced by the gallbladderand in mice FGF15 is pro- duced in the hypothalamus where it signals to lower glucagon production.In the intestine FXR modulates the kinetics of glucose absorption which is delayed in FXR-deficient mice.FXR reduces postprandial glucose utilization by inhibiting he- patic glycolysis and lipogenesiswhereas FGF1519 increases glycogenesis.Thus in the postprandial state FXR lowers splanchnic glucose utilization .In enteroendocrine L cells BAs regulate the production and secretion of GLP-1 via opposite effects on TGR5 and FXR.

By contrast FXR activation represses preproglucagon gene expression and GLP-1 secretion in the ileum by inhibiting glycolysis and carbohydrate responsive element binding protein activity in L cells.Because TGR5-mediated cyto- solic signaling is rapid whereas transcriptional regulation by FXR is slow and because FXR expression is more prox- imal than TGR5 in the intestine these receptors likely exert opposing effects on GLP-1 production which are however separated in time and space.FXR and TGR5 are both expressed in pancreatic b-cells where they positively regulate synthesis and glucose-induced secretion of insulin.In addition TGR5 activation in pancreatic a-cells induces pro-convertase-1 expression shifting glucagon production to GLP-1 hence increasing b-cell mass and function in a paracrine manner.Pertur- bations in hepatic glucose metabolism alter BA synthesis impacting on FXR-regulated b-cell glucose-stimulated insulin secretion identifying a liver pancreas BA signaling connection.BAS treatment also improves glucose homeostasis and colesevelam is a US Food and Drug Administration approved oral antidiabetic drug.

In addition it induces the FXR antagonist MCA in rodents whereas the FXR agonist CDCA is predominant in humans cautioning the extrapolation of rodent studies to humans.Apical Sodium Dependent Bile Acid Transporter InhibitorsThe impairment of intestinal BA reuptake by inhibiting ASBT improves features of NAFLD and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice.Similar to BAS ASBT inhibitors ASBT-I reduce intestinal BA absorption decreasing hepatic BA supply and thus FXR activation resulting in de-repression of CYP7A1 and enhanced conversion of cholesterol to BA.

Intriguingly colonization of germ-free mice with human microbiota de- creases the formation of secondary BA species especially the FXR antagonist TbMCA thereby increasing ileal FXR activity and FGF15 expression.As BA receptors have different af- finities for distinct BA species see Bile Acids Signaling Molecules Modulating Meta-Inflammatory Diseases section the gut bacteria can modulate metabolism and host physiology by altering BA pool composition.Because type 2 diabetes T2D obesity and non- alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD are associated with dysbiosis and changes of the BA pool size and composition-the interaction of gut microbiota with BA metabolism and its impact on these pathophysiologic con- ditions is of great interest.

Natural FXR agonists are CDCA DCACALCA in order of decreasing potency while Ta- TbMCA and possibly UDCA are antagonists.Ligand-bound FXR forms a heterodimer with retinoic X receptors a b or g to regulate target gene expression.

In addition to ligands post-translational modifications also modulate the tran- scriptional activity of FXR such as O-GlcNAcylation methylation acetylationand phosphorylation via adeno- sine monophosphate activated protein kinase and protein kinase C.-Interestingly acetylation of FXR increases inflammation and deteriorates glucose metabolism by inter- fering with its sumoylation and transrepressive activity.Table 1.

Administration of FGF19 to HFD-fed mice enhances the metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity and decreases body weight.The increase of FGF19 associated with T2D remission after RYGB may thus also contribute to the metabolic improvements after surgeryin humans.In addition pharmacologic activation of intes- tinal FXR with fexaramine a synthetic FXR agonist with intestine-restricted bioavailability induces FGF15 in mice reducing diet-induced weight gain systemic inflammation and hepatic glucose production.FGF15 induces changes in BA pool composition and increases TGR5 ligand production leading to both BAT activation enhanced thermogenesis and white adipose tissue browning.

Furthermore FXR increases very-low-density lipoprotein receptor expression.The inhibition of BA synthesis from choles- terol upon FXR activation results in increased hepatic cholesterol concentrations therefore LDL-R activity decreases and plasma LDL-C increases.Levels of lipoprotein a an atherogenic lipoprotein decrease due to reduced hepatic apoa gene expressionFigure 2.

Further attention is required to evaluate the impact of FXR activation on cardiovascular risk.In humans CDCA and the semi-synthetic FXR agonist obeticholic acid OCA INT-747 or 6-ethyl-CDCA Intercept Pharmaceuticals New York NY increase low-density lipo- protein LDL cholesterol likely via FXR-dependent CYP7A1 inhibition thus decreasing hepatic cholesterol conversion to BA increasing hepatic cholesterol content and inhibiting LDL-R activity .
