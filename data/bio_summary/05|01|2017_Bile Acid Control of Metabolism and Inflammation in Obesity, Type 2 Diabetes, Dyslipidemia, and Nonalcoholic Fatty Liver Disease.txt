tgr5 activation in pancreatic a-cells induces pro-convertase-1 shifting proglucagon processing from glucagon to glp-1 10. fxr and tgr5 activation in pancreatic b-cells promotes insulin secretion lowering glycemia 11. ba synthesis in the hepatocyte is decreased by fgf15 19-fgfr4bklotho activation and fxr activation via shp-lrh-1 12. accoa acetyl co-enzyme a bsep bile salt export protein l-pk liver pyruvate kinase ost ab organic solute transporters a and b vldl very low density lipoprotein.acids in the ileum and glp-1 secretion.furthermore mca may inhibit intestinal fxr which enhances glp-1 produc- tion.however translation of these findings to humans is unlikely see lipid metabolism section.initial studies suggested a role of fxr in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing the expression of therate-limiting enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy- kinase glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-16- biphosphatase-1.

an important unresolved question is whether through treating with metabolically stable highly active synthetic ba analogues interfering permanently with the fxr signaling pathway whose functions differ in fasting and fed condi- tions and ba synthesis which is submitted to circadian fluctuations might in the long term induce unwanted effects.based on existing preclinical data and clinical use of bas it appears that an orally administered inhibitor of intestinal fxr would be preferential to improve glucose and choles- terol metabolism whereas a liver-targeted fxr agonist would improve liver function and fibrosis.caution should also be taken when translating data from preclinical murine models to humans because ba pool modulation affects the hydrophobicity index differently in mice vs humans and mice produce the fxr antagonist tbmca which is absent in humans.

furthermore fxr increases very-low-density lipoprotein receptor expression.the inhibition of ba synthesis from choles- terol upon fxr activation results in increased hepatic cholesterol concentrations therefore ldl-r activity decreases and plasma ldl-c increases.levels of lipoprotein a an atherogenic lipoprotein decrease due to reduced hepatic apoa gene expressionfigure 2. bas control lipoprotein metabolism through hepatic and intestinal fxr activation.

in humans fgf19 is also produced by the gallbladderand in mice fgf15 is pro- duced in the hypothalamus where it signals to lower glucagon production.in the intestine fxr modulates the kinetics of glucose absorption which is delayed in fxr-deficient mice.fxr reduces postprandial glucose utilization by inhibiting he- patic glycolysis and lipogenesiswhereas fgf1519 increases glycogenesis.thus in the postprandial state fxr lowers splanchnic glucose utilization .in enteroendocrine l cells bas regulate the production and secretion of glp-1 via opposite effects on tgr5 and fxr.

by contrast fxr activation represses preproglucagon gene expression and glp-1 secretion in the ileum by inhibiting glycolysis and carbohydrate responsive element binding protein activity in l cells.because tgr5-mediated cyto- solic signaling is rapid whereas transcriptional regulation by fxr is slow and because fxr expression is more prox- imal than tgr5 in the intestine these receptors likely exert opposing effects on glp-1 production which are however separated in time and space.fxr and tgr5 are both expressed in pancreatic b-cells where they positively regulate synthesis and glucose-induced secretion of insulin.in addition tgr5 activation in pancreatic a-cells induces pro-convertase-1 expression shifting glucagon production to glp-1 hence increasing b-cell mass and function in a paracrine manner.pertur- bations in hepatic glucose metabolism alter ba synthesis impacting on fxr-regulated b-cell glucose-stimulated insulin secretion identifying a liver pancreas ba signaling connection.bas treatment also improves glucose homeostasis and colesevelam is a us food and drug administration approved oral antidiabetic drug.

in addition it induces the fxr antagonist mca in rodents whereas the fxr agonist cdca is predominant in humans cautioning the extrapolation of rodent studies to humans.apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter inhibitorsthe impairment of intestinal ba reuptake by inhibiting asbt improves features of nafld and insulin sensitivity in hfd-fed mice.similar to bas asbt inhibitors asbt-i reduce intestinal ba absorption decreasing hepatic ba supply and thus fxr activation resulting in de-repression of cyp7a1 and enhanced conversion of cholesterol to ba.

intriguingly colonization of germ-free mice with human microbiota de- creases the formation of secondary ba species especially the fxr antagonist tbmca thereby increasing ileal fxr activity and fgf15 expression.as ba receptors have different af- finities for distinct ba species see bile acids signaling molecules modulating meta-inflammatory diseases section the gut bacteria can modulate metabolism and host physiology by altering ba pool composition.because type 2 diabetes t2d obesity and non- alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld are associated with dysbiosis and changes of the ba pool size and composition-the interaction of gut microbiota with ba metabolism and its impact on these pathophysiologic con- ditions is of great interest.

natural fxr agonists are cdca dcacalca in order of decreasing potency while ta- tbmca and possibly udca are antagonists.ligand-bound fxr forms a heterodimer with retinoic x receptors a b or g to regulate target gene expression.

in addition to ligands post-translational modifications also modulate the tran- scriptional activity of fxr such as o-glcnacylation methylation acetylationand phosphorylation via adeno- sine monophosphate activated protein kinase and protein kinase c.-interestingly acetylation of fxr increases inflammation and deteriorates glucose metabolism by inter- fering with its sumoylation and transrepressive activity.table 1. influence of obesity insulin resistance type 2 diabetes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and bariatric surgery roux-en-y gastric bypass vertical sleeve gastrectomy bilio-pancreatic diversion and adjustable gastric banding on peripheral blood bile acid concentrations35 t2d200 non-diabetic patients classified into quartiles based on ir12 t2d12 matched non- diabetic controls12 t2d62 non-diabetic volunteersfeeding states positively correlated with increasing meal fat content compared with non-diabetic controlsfastingnalc-mst2d patients total ba concentrations without changes in the 12a-hydroxy to non-12a-hydroxy- ba rationon-diabetic ir patients  12a-hydroxy to non-12a- hydroxy-ba ratio associated with y insulin sensitivity and  plasma tgsfasting meal testnahplc-msmsfasting no changes in total ba in t2d compared withnon-diabetic controlspostprandial total and glyco-ba in t2d compared with non-diabetic controlsfastingnahplc-msmsfasting  tauro ba in t2d patients compared with non-diabetic controlshaeusler 2013vincent 2013wewalka 201420 t2d14 healthyfastingnagc-ms total ba concentrations in obese and t2d patientscariou 201122 obesecompared with controlsdca in t2d compared with controlsca in obese patients compared with controls cdca and ca and to a lesser extent dca positivelyassociated to ir in obese and t2d patients7 nash15 healthyfasting postprandialnalc-msmsfasting and postprandial  total ba concentrations innash compared with controls due to conjugated speciesferslew 2015rygb9--fasting2 y 4 yhplc-msms2 y 4 y  total bapatti 200919--fasting1 mo 3 mohplc-ms1 mo 3 mo  total banakatani 200935--fasting3 moenzymatic assay 3 mo  total bajansen 201112--fasting4 d 42 dlc-msms42 d  total bapournaras 201230--fasting1 yenzymatic assay hplc-msms1 y  total ba y tauro-basimonen 201236 t2d-r37fasting1 ylc-msms1 y  total ba in t2d-rgerhard 201321 t2d-nr8--fastingafter 20 of weight losslc-ms total bakohli 2013table 1. continuedcase ncontrols nfeeding statetime after surgerymethodologyoutcomefirst author yearbilio-pancreatic diversion1510 bmi-matched nonsurgicalfasting7 wk 53 wklc-msms7 wk  total ba mainly due to free ba53 wk  total ba but lower than 7 wkferrannini 2015lagb6--fasting4 d 42 dlc-msmsno changes in total bapournaras 201210--fastingpostprandial after 20 of weight loss lc-msfasting y total bapostprandial no changes in total bakohli 2013note.

administration of fgf19 to hfd-fed mice enhances the metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity and decreases body weight.the increase of fgf19 associated with t2d remission after rygb may thus also contribute to the metabolic improvements after surgeryin humans.in addition pharmacologic activation of intes- tinal fxr with fexaramine a synthetic fxr agonist with intestine-restricted bioavailability induces fgf15 in mice reducing diet-induced weight gain systemic inflammation and hepatic glucose production.fgf15 induces changes in ba pool composition and increases tgr5 ligand production leading to both bat activation enhanced thermogenesis and white adipose tissue browning.

further attention is required to evaluate the impact of fxr activation on cardiovascular risk.in humans cdca and the semi-synthetic fxr agonist obeticholic acid oca int-747 or 6-ethyl-cdca intercept pharmaceuticals new york ny increase low-density lipo- protein ldl cholesterol likely via fxr-dependent cyp7a1 inhibition thus decreasing hepatic cholesterol conversion to ba increasing hepatic cholesterol content and inhibiting ldl-r activity .

in line cyp7a1-- mice are protected from high-fat high-cholesterol induced metabolic disorders likely due to up-regulation of the alternative ba synthesis pathway and hence a more hydrophilic ba pool.impor- tantly studies in mice explaining the increase in reverse cholesterol transport and transintestinal cholesterol excretion upon fxr activation by modifications in the hydrophobicity index of the ba pool are unlikely to translate to human pathophysiology as hydrophobic cdca will predominate in humans vs hydrophilic mca in rodents.ba sequestrants bas are anionic exchange resins that trap bas in the intestinal lumen increasing fecal ba output hence decreasing intestinal fxr activity.

together most observations suggest that inactivation of intestinal fxr results in an improved metabolic profile although treatment with the intestinal-selective fxr agonist fexaramine was also reported to improve metabolism.inhibition or deficiency of cyp8b1 improves glucose ho- meostasis by increasing glp-1 in mice.

fxr activation in the enterocyte modulates the absorption of glucose 1 and ba 2 and induces fgf1519 secretion 3. in the liver fxr activation decreases glycolysis and lipogenesis via inhibition of carbohydrate responsive element binding protein chrebp 4 and sterol responsive element binding protein 1 srebp1c 5 respectively hence decreasing very-low-density lipoprotein vldltriglyceride tg production.

as discussed intestinal antagonism of fxr appears to improve metabolic control whereas hepatic fxr activation may improve hepatic fibrosis.
