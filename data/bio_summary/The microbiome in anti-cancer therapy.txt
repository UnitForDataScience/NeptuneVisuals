in this review we focus on the effects the microbiome has on the efficacy of a number of anti-cancer treatment strategies including immunotherapy  chemotherapy and adoptive cell transfer therapy  and the potential mechanisms and ramifications of these effects.the microbiome and cancer immunityimmune system - cancer interactions play important roles in cancer prevention development and progression and are reviewed in depth elsewhere .

bage-1 cyclin-a1 and ly6k produced by cancer cells induce an immune response during which t cells eliminate cancer cells .

when cancer cells become unrecogniz- able to immune surveillance by means of cancer cell genetic mutagen- esis or by accumulation of epigenetic modifications  the cancer enters the escape phase.

efforts of modulating the microbiome using more targeted approaches such as probiotics  prebiotic nutritional  and postbiotic interventions may enable to control pathobionts impacting cancer therapy efficacy while not impacting the microbiome ecosystem at its entirety.likewise enhanced understanding of the roles the 'tumor micro- biome' plays in shaping the tumor immune metabolic and pharmaco- logic microenvironment may fundamentally impact our ability to harness features of this local microbial niche towards better cancer treatment responsiveness.

in 'real- life' cancer in contrast the nature of immune system interaction with cancer greatly differs during the cancer elimination equilibrium and escape stages.

it was later shown in the 1920s that intravesicular injection of mycobacterium bovis in patientswith superficial bladder cancer resulted in an anti-cancer immune response leading to an increased survival rate  thereby demonstrat- ing microbial immune activation leading to cancer cells clearing.

as such the effects of il-17 on colorectal cancer may vary in relation to the tumor treatment and microbiome context.another limitation of clinical translation of microbiome effects ontumor therapy is that most were conducted in mouse tumor models using syngenic cancerous cell systems that have already undergone a process of immune editing before transfer into the new host.

in all the expanding research focusing on elucidating the roles of the microbiome in impacting cancer treatment represents a new and exciting frontier towards future harnessing of the microbiome as a diagnostic patient stratification prognostic and treatment anti-cancermodality.acknowledgementswe thank the members of the elinav laboratory for discussions and apologize to authors whose work not included in the review due to space constraints.

mice lacking components of the tlr pathway tlr4-- and myd88-- mice did not respond to treatment with oxaliplatin indicating that tlr agonists from members of the commensal microbiome may promote ros generation by innate immune cells within the tumor microenvir- onment leading to tumor cell death.alkylating agentsone of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of lymphomas and solid tumors is cyclophosphamide ctx an alkylating agent that also induces immunomodulatory effects and immunogenic cancer cell death .

in this review we present recent advances in understanding of the intricate role of microbiome in modulating efficacy of a number of anti-cancer treatments and discuss how anti-cancer treatment approaches utilizing the tumor microbiome may enhance oncological treatment efficacy.introductionthe microbiome in cancercancer treatment has matured over the past few decades to include a number of treatment modalities such as surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy immunotherapy and hormonal therapy .
