J Neurol 2017 2642027-2030 DOI 10.1007s00415-017-8588-7Non-CNS pathogenic origin of Parkinson's diseaseHumdoon Choudhry1  Lawrence C. Perlmuter2Received 25 June 2017  Revised 6 August 2017  Accepted 7 August 2017  Published online 14 August 2017c Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017Abstract The gut with its variety of microbiota may serve as an etiological origin of diseases.

To this end Braak has offered a dual-hit hypothesis that proposes a novel etiol- ogy for Parkinson's disease PD.

A protein known as alpha-synuclein accumulates in brains of people with Parkinson's disease that is also present in the GI before the onset of motor symptoms.

Finally the vagus nerve of the autonomic system that extends from the brain to the abdomen and exercises both sympathetic and parasympathetic roles might be associated with PD diagno- sis along with Lewy body influences.Keywords Parkinson's disease  Braak's dual-hit hypothesis  Gut microbes  Vagus nerve  Alpha- synuclein  Peripheral a-synucleinopathyIntroductionThe pathological origin of idiopathicnon-heritable Parkin- son's disease PD is debated.

found in a Parkinson's mouse model that a-synuclein aggregates injected into the gastrointestinal lining travelled to the brain stem containing motor vagal neurons and then eventually spread to the mid brain .

Therefore pre-motor symptoms and a-synucleinopathy involving the nose and the gut before the onset of motor symptoms of PD allude to an underlying gastrointestinal and autonomic pathology   .Suspected pathogen behind Parkinson's diseaseThe identity of the proposed neurotropic pathogen is also an area of research currently.

However in vivo studies are needed to affirm the proposed viral infection hypotheses of Parkinson's pathology.After the proposed virus has bypassed the projection pathways lacking BBB--from the olfactory receptor neurons to the CNS and the autonomic preganglionic fibers to the CNS--it might travel via axonal transport or trans-synapti- cally between neurons .
