to this end braak has offered a dual-hit hypothesis that proposes a novel etiol- ogy for parkinson's disease pd.

a protein known as alpha-synuclein accumulates in brains of people with parkinson's disease that is also present in the gi before the onset of motor symptoms.

finally the vagus nerve of the autonomic system that extends from the brain to the abdomen and exercises both sympathetic and parasympathetic roles might be associated with pd diagno- sis along with lewy body influences.keywords parkinson's disease  braak's dual-hit hypothesis  gut microbes  vagus nerve  alpha- synuclein  peripheral a-synucleinopathyintroductionthe pathological origin of idiopathicnon-heritable parkin- son's disease pd is debated.

found in a parkinson's mouse model that a-synuclein aggregates injected into the gastrointestinal lining travelled to the brain stem containing motor vagal neurons and then eventually spread to the mid brain .

therefore pre-motor symptoms and a-synucleinopathy involving the nose and the gut before the onset of motor symptoms of pd allude to an underlying gastrointestinal and autonomic pathology   .suspected pathogen behind parkinson's diseasethe identity of the proposed neurotropic pathogen is also an area of research currently.

however in vivo studies are needed to affirm the proposed viral infection hypotheses of parkinson's pathology.after the proposed virus has bypassed the projection pathways lacking bbb--from the olfactory receptor neurons to the cns and the autonomic preganglionic fibers to the cns--it might travel via axonal transport or trans-synapti- cally between neurons .

however a relationship between gut bacteria and the pathogen--if one exists--needs further cor- roborative studies.alternative model to the dual-hit pathogenesis of parkinson's diseasethere are also some contrary findings against the dual- hit model and the proposed disease progression pathway.

nevertheless since mechanisms of lewy pathology and disease progression are still under research non-cns sites of pd origin cannot be disregarded .relationship between vagotomy and parkinson's disease risksince the vagus nerve is identified to be one of the projection pathways used by the pathogen to reach the cns vagotomy might prevent or delay the onset of pd  .

however regardless specialists at aan mentioned that they still consider braak's hypothesis to be alive and well .relationship between appendectomy and parkinson's disease riskappendix is another organ of interest because it contains a-synuclein aggregates and its removal might delay the onset of pd -.

the patients still developed pd however because other gastrointestinal and olfactory systems might have been already affected by the pathogen .possible biomarker for parkinson's disease screening and diagnosisunlike the brain a-synuclein aggregates are accessible for biopsy from the peripheral non-cns sites.

such disease progression also makes screening and diagnosis more feasible unlike previ- ous methods which are based only on medical history and review of symptoms.2030j neurol 2017 2642027-2030compliance with ethical standardsconflicts of interest on behalf of all authors the corresponding au- thor states that there is no conflict of interest.referenceshawkes ch del tredici k braak h 2007 parkinson's disease a dual-hit hypothesis.
