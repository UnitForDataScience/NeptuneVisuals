Although a precise definition of what depth below the surface is considered deep is system- dependent constraining the limits of the deep hot biosphere to those environments that exhibit temperatures higher than50 degC and are 1 m below the surface as is used elsewhere tooperationally define the deep subsurface 50 provide a metric from which to compare like environments.Although there are a number of similarities between marine and terrestrial subsurface environments important differencesFeFe-Hydrogenases86420Mo-CO Dehydrogenases40200Acetyl-CoA Synthases86420NiFe-Hydrogenases20100Ni-CO Dehydrogenases86420Formate Dehydrogenases20100studies reveal a unique and considerable diversity of both culti- vated and uncultivated lineages of Bacteria and Archaea that predominate deep thermal subsurface environments.

 PERSPECTIVEThe deep hot biosphere Twenty-five years of retrospectionDaniel R. Colmana Saroj Poudela Blake W. Stampsb Eric S. Boydac1 and John R. Spearbc1Edited by David M. Karl University of Hawaii Honolulu HI and approved May 16 2017 received for review January 25 2017Twenty-five years ago this month Thomas Gold published a seminal manuscript suggesting the presence of a deep hot biosphere in the Earth's crust.

To this end we suggest the need to develop a robust network of interdisciplin- ary scientists and accessible field sites for long-term monitoring of the Earth's subsurface in the form of a deep subsurface microbiome initiative.geobiology  biogeochemistry  hydrogen  subsurface  thermophilesA quarter-century ago this month Thomas Gold an Austrian-born astrophysicist from Cornell University pub- lished a paper in these pages entitled simply The deep hot biosphere 1.

Indeed H2 has become a major focal point for microbiologists studying the deep subsurface 1415 and has been suggested to be the fuel that supported the earliest forms of life on Earth 16-18.Gold's deep hot biosphere contribution challenged para- digms in subsurface science petroleum research the origin and evolution of life and the search for life on other planets.

The physiological characteristics of this organism its ecology and its primitive nature are consistent with the notion of a deep hot biosphere.The Diversity of Life in the Deep SubsurfaceInitially we learned about the deep hot biosphere from cultivation of taxa in fluids sampled from oil wells mines caves and geo- thermal and hydrothermal environments among others 39-42.

Although a number of other definitions can be used this framework is used to guide the following discussion of the deep hot biosphere.In terrestrial settings studies within mines 43 45 54 55 at depths of between 102 and 103 m below the surface and borehole drilling into hydrothermal environments 15 have provided critical information on the nature of the deep hot biosphere.

Recent metagenomic analyses of these samples have provided a glimpse into the considerable phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of the deep hot marine subsurface via reconstructed genomes from metagenomes that have expanded on previous molecular surveys 81.Although much insight has been gained into the nature of life in the deep hot biosphere over the previous 25 years since Thomas Gold's seminal work there are a number of questions that remain unanswered.

The techniques used to better study and understand deep hot bio- spheres on Earth could then be applied to robotically probe tar- gets in deep space as we move into the next century of scientific discovery.

Since this publication a considerable amount of attention has been given to the study of deep biospheres their role in geochemical cycles and their potential to inform on the origin of life and its potential outside of Earth.

Overwhelming evidence now supports the presence of a deep biosphere ubiquitously distributed on Earth in both terrestrial and marine settings.
