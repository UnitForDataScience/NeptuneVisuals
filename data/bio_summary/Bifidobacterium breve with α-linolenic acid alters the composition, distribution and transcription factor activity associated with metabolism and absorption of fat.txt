Furthermore the potential of VSL3 a multistrain preparation composed of Streptococcus thermophilus and several strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium for reducing inflammation reduced TNFa and cyclooxygenase expression increased PPARa expression and oxidative damage inducible nitric oxide synthase to the liver while ameliorating the liver lipid profiles has been shown.The data presented in this study confirmed that dietary ALA positively impacted on tissue fatty acid com- position increased hepatic n-3 PUFA metabolism and reduced hepatic TAG levels hepatic fatty acid synthesis enzymes and hepatic uptake of fatty acids and demonstrated effects on the ECS.

breve DPC 6330 positively influenced tissue fatty acid profiles in different animal species and models while alsoinfluencing host intestinal microbiota composition.These data suggest that dietary supplementation with a commensal bacterium can significantly influence health through the production of bioactive conjugated fatty acids and by increasing tissue concentrations of bioactive long-chain LC members of the n-3 PUFA family eicosapentaenoic acid EPA C205 docosa- pentaenoic acid C225 and docosahexaenoic acid DHA C226.

To investigate the effects of the ALA enriched diet on tissue fatty acid composition fatty acid profiling saturated and unsaturated was performed on liver and epididymal adipose tissue.

For unsaturated fatty acids all ALA enriched groups had increased stearidonic acid C184 in the liver P  0.05 2 increased ALA C183n-3 and EPA C205 in both liver P  0.05 2 and adipose tissue P  0.05 3 and decreased arachidonic acid C204 and oleic acid C181 in adipose tissue P  0.05 3 compared with CON.Comparing the effects of dietary supplementation with ALA  NCIMB 702258 with ALA-CON there were significant increases in the saturated fatty acids caprylic acid P  0.05 2 capric acid C100 P  0.05 2 lauric acid C120 P  0.05 2 and myristic acid C140 P  0.05 2 in liver and increased pentadecyclic acid C150 P  0.05 3 and stearic acid C180 P  0.05 3 in adipose tissue.

ALA  NCIMB 702258 ALA  DPC 6330 and CON demonstrated significantly reduced hepatic mRNA expression of D-5-desaturase compared with ALA-CON P  0.01 Both ALA NCIMB 702258 and ALA DPC 6330 exhibited decreased hepatic mRNA expression of CD-36 compared with ALA-CON and CON P  0.05 In addition ALA  NCIMB 702258 and ALA  DPC 6330 had decreased hepatic mRNA expression of fatty acid binding protein FABP-1 compared with ALA-CON P  0.05 Hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP-1c was increased in ALA DPC 6330 compared with CON P  0.05 Impact on mRNA gene expression levels of enzymes involved in the transport and uptake of fatty acids to the ileum following dietary enrichment with ALA either alone or supplemented with B. breve NCIMB 702258 or B. breve DPC 6330.

The work presented herein tested the hypothesis that the alterations in host tissue fatty acid composition by B. breve could be linked to modulation of fat absorption processes in the small intestine and or metabolism of fatty acids to longer-chain unsaturated derivatives in the liver.Figure 1.

Highly polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids replace arachidonic acid as an eicosanoid substrate in cell membranes resulting in decreased production of arachidonic acid-derived proinflammatory eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4thus increased tissue EPA could be beneficial in a variety of chronic inflammatory settings such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and IBD.
