Immobilized antimicrobial peptides with antibiofilm activity have also been de- scribed including peptide CWR11 immobilized on catheters via a polydopamine-peptide strategy which exhibits activity against E. coli S. aureus and P. aerugi- nosa .A study by Yadavalli and colleagues  demonstrated that certain antimicrobial peptides at sublethal concen- trations cause filamentation via interference with cell division in E. coli.

Interestingly one of these anti-biofilm peptides has been turned into a dimer by incorporation of a disulfide bond which led to increased antimicrobial and anti- biofilm activities .Additional studies have also successfully incorporated precision engineering capabilities into peptides.

The same applies to the other two examples where peptides against green center image and purple bacteria right image would selectively remove these organisms.with opportunistic pathogens such as Enterococcus fae- cium carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium difficile  the latter being responsible for 14000 deaths per year only in the US.

Future work will have to address issues with delivery stability in vivo and potential off-target killing effects of precision peptides to prevent unintended removal of microbes.LysinsLysins also known as endolysins or murein peptidogly- can hydrolases are hydrolytic enzymes produced by bacteriophages or phages that break down the cell wall of target bacteria during the final stage of the lytic phage cycle.

The authors reported the use of CRISPR-Cas technology to create sequence-specific antimicrobials whose spectrum of activity is chosen by design.

However PNAs have limited activity in the host due to their inherent high hydrophobicity resulting from the lack of phosphate groups within their backbone which leads to unselective interactions and consequently cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity that still need to be addressed.

The peptides were tested against tar- get and non-target species and exhibited great selectivi- ty.

The authors identified the C-terminal amino acids 108 to 138 of phage lysin PlyF307 termed P307 to be sufficient to kill A. baumannii 53.. Lysin P307 wasFigure 3Design principles for selective peptides.

Hypothetical images of modifications that can be made to generate precision peptides.further engineered to generate improved variants such as P307SQ-8C which had activity against biofilms MIC values comparable to those of standard-of-care antibiotics such as levofloxacin and ceftazidime and synergy with polymyxin B. P307SQ-8C further reduced the bacterial burden in a mouse model of A. baumannii skin infection.

The strategies described here thus represent an excellent framework for designing next- generation precision antibacterials.Conflict of interestThe authors report no conflict of interests associated with this manuscript.AcknowledgementsSome of the figures shown here were prepared using the Motifolio drawing toolkit.Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez is a Ramon Areces Foundation Fellow Spain.
