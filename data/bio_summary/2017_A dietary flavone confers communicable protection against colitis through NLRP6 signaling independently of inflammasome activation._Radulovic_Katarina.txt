Collectively the impact of apigenin on the gut microbiota was dependenton Nlrp6 expression and associated with its anti-inflammatory effect that can be acquired de novo after cohousing.The anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin relies on an intact Nlrp6 signaling pathway independently of caspase-1 and its adaptor ASC.Even if the disease risk in mice deficient for Caspase-1 encoded by the Casp1 gene is similar to that observed in the absence of the Nlrp6 protein 8 it is still not clear whether Nlrp6 may physiologically form a molecular platform with caspase-1 and the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain namely Asc encoded by Pycard gene.

Collectively Nlrp6 determines to a large extent how apigenin protects mice from intestinal inflammation by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota independently of inflammasome activation as what observed in response to several enteric viruses 17.An intact Nlrp6 pathway is required for the anti-proliferative effect of apigenin on intestinal epithelial cells.We next evaluated if the changes in the gut microbiota in response to apigenin may impact intestinal homeostasis by qRTPCR analysis on the colon from control mice that were either single-housed or co-housed with apigenin- treated animals.

On this basisour study revealed an inflammasome-independent mechanism whereby the protective effect of apigenin relies on Nlrp6 signaling and its downstream effectors including the c-type lectin Reg3b and potentially some antimicrobial peptides that are also regulated by Nlrp6 22.

Herein we provide evidence that the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effect of the flavone apigenin relies on the regulation of the gut microbiota by the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 Nlrp6.

We find that the anti-proliferative effect of apigenin and subsequently its protective effect against colitis were dominantly transmitted after co- housing while being compromised in mice that are deficient in Nlrp6 within the same facility.

Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA revealed a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota in apigenin-treated mice that was not observed in the absence of Nlrp6.
