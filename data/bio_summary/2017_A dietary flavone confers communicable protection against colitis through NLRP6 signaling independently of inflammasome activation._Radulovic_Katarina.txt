age- and gender- matched nlrp6-deficient nlrp6-- caspase 1-deficient casp1-- asc- deficient pycard-- reg3b-deficient reg3b-- and control c57bl6j mice had free access to a standard laboratory chow diet in a half-day light cycle exposure and temperature-controlled environment.

collectively the impact of apigenin on the gut microbiota was dependenton nlrp6 expression and associated with its anti-inflammatory effect that can be acquired de novo after cohousing.the anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin relies on an intact nlrp6 signaling pathway independently of caspase-1 and its adaptor asc.even if the disease risk in mice deficient for caspase-1 encoded by the casp1 gene is similar to that observed in the absence of the nlrp6 protein 8 it is still not clear whether nlrp6 may physiologically form a molecular platform with caspase-1 and the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain namely asc encoded by pycard gene.

however the efficacy of apigenin was not compromised by the dysbiotic microbiota of casp1- and pycard-deficient mice even if their disease risk is similar to that observed in the absence of the nlrp6 protein 14. on this basisour study revealed an inflammasome-independent mechanism whereby the protective effect of apigenin relies on nlrp6 signaling and its downstream effectors including the c-type lectin reg3b and potentially some antimicrobial peptides that are also regulated by nlrp6 22. equally interesting is the need to define whether the anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin may rely on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism 23 24. of note the compositional change in the microbiota of nlrp6-deficient mice results in a low taurine and high sperminehistamine levels which contributes to its dominant takeover 22. alternatively one may hypothesize that apigenin may promote a growth advantage of several bile-tolerant members of the alistispes genus that were found less abundant in the absence of nlrp6.

collectively nlrp6 determines to a large extent how apigenin protects mice from intestinal inflammation by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota independently of inflammasome activation as what observed in response to several enteric viruses 17.an intact nlrp6 pathway is required for the anti-proliferative effect of apigenin on intestinal epithelial cells.we next evaluated if the changes in the gut microbiota in response to apigenin may impact intestinal homeostasis by qrtpcr analysis on the colon from control mice that were either single-housed or co-housed with apigenin- treated animals.

6b c. of note the reduced proliferation index of apigenin-treated mice was dominantly transmitted after co-housing of control animals but not nlrp6-- mice fig.

reg3b is a c mitogenic -type lectin which expression is lowered in the colon of nlrp6-- mice supplementary fig.

a principal coordinate analysis of fecal bacterial communities profiled from wild-type and nlrp6-- mice that were treated or not with apigenin over a 3-week period.

black and white symbols represent wild-type and nlrp6-- mice respectively.

non-treated and apigenin- treated nlrp6-- mice were cohoused for 3 weeks of apigenin treatment and then subjected to dss.

consistent with the results observed with casp1-- mice disease severity was improved in apigenin-treated pycard-- mice when compared to untreated mutant animals fig.
