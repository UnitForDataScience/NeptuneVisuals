g he staining of liver tissues for hepatic steatosis masson's trichrome staining of liver tissues for fibrosis immunohistological staining of cd3 lymphocytes for liver inflammation by the mice at the end of fbt h liver inflammation was assessed by expression of tnf-a by the mice at the end of fbt.liver fibrosis was assessed by expression of type i collagen.

after ten weeks of feeding the mice fed with hd were divided into 3 groups n10 and subjected to 1 without treatment hd 2 cholestyramine was added to hd diet at 3 ww chol and 3 polystyrene treatment ps for additional 12 weeks.

in addition to its original designation as bile acid sequestrant to reduce plasma cholesterol cholestyramine was found to promote glp-1 expression through activation of tgr5 a g protein-coupled receptor for bile acids 19. a small sized clinical study showed that colestimide could improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis while the underlying mechanism is unknown 20. another clinical study applied bile acid sequestrant to treat t2d patients 21. the authors found that the bile acid levels were not correlated to the efficacy of the treatment which raises a question for the actual role of bile acid sequestration in the treatment.

on the other hand simple hepatic steatosis is benign but about 20 of the population with simple steatosis may further progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis nash characterized by hepatic inflammation and liver fibrosis 8 9. to explain the transition from simple steatosis to nash a two hit theory was proposed suggesting that a second hit such as viral infectionxenobiotic exposure or others may drive thepatho-physiological progression 10.epidemic survey indicates association of vitamin d deficiency with chronic liver diseases obesity and mets 11 12 13. through animal models we previously demonstrate that vitamin d deficiency vdd acts as a second hit to exacerbate the impact of high fat diet leading to robust metabolic disorders with features of nash 14. recently we showed that vitamin d signaling through induction of paneth cell specific alpha-defensins maintains gut eubiosis to antagonize mets 15. given the nature of positive charges by the secretory-form of alpha-defensins we reasoned that applying positively charged resins might have similar impacts.research designanimal treatment and measurementc57bl6j mice male 4-6 weeks old were fed either control chow ain93 containing 10-12 calories from fat and 1000 ukg vitamin d3 hfk bioscience or vitamin d deficient high fat diet hd 60 calories from fat and without vitamin d supplement.

the results were in agreement with the clinical findings showing increased firmicutes and decreased bacteroidetes in obese patients 718. importantly cholestyramine treatment restored eubiosis showing reduction of firmicutes and restoration of bacteroidetes.

cholestyramine treatment restored the akkermansia muciniphila to a ratio of 6 among the total bacteria.

3b-c closely similar gut microbiota appeared grouping together in two states gut microbiota from the mice by cholestyramine treatment was closely related to that in the control feeding while the microbiota from the mice treated by polystyrene treated mice were closely related to the ones from the hd feeding.

again the increased phylum firmicutes by hd feeding was suppressed by cholestyramine treatment.

3d-e.the microbes derived from the cholestyramine treatment are sufficient to antagonize the metabolic disorders of the recipients.given the fact of restoring of eubiosis and reduction of plasma endotoxin by cationic administration we asked if the rebalanced gut microbiota was sufficient to antagonize the mets.

data were mean - sem.figure 2. nash features are antagonized by cholestyramine treatment.
