In addition to this symbiotic relation- ship the respiratory microbiota probably has a role in the structural maturation of the respiratory tract5 and in shaping local immunity67.Current research questions address how the healthy respiratory microbiota is established and what ecologi- cal and environmental factors govern its development.

By contrast the composition of the sputum microbi- ota seems to be influenced equally by host genetics and environmental factors37.Although the gut microbiota matures into an adult-like community during the first 3 years of life38 the time that is required to establish a stable respiratory microbiota remains to be determined.

It has been pro- posed that the dynamic nature of the developing micro- biota early in life might provide a window of opportunity for the modulation of the microbiota towards a bene- ficial composition45 however the extent of this period of time is currently unknown.The microbiota of the upper respiratory tract Gatekeeper to respiratory health.

Culture-independent262  MAY 2017  VOLUME 15REVIEWS microbiota studies have confirmed that the lung micro- biota largely resembles the URT microbiota when stud- ied in healthy individuals74-76.

The contribution of the gas- tric microbiota to the microbial community in the LRT through gastric-oesophageal reflux has until now been suggested to be negligible74.Composition of the lung microbiota.

A study in young children reported that although the lung microbiota was distinct from the microbiota of the URT it was dominated by species that are also present in the URT including Moraxella spp.

Given the low density and presumably transient microbiota in the LRT it could be speculated that the diversity of this microbiota is shaped by interbacterial relationships to a lesser extent than bacterial communities in the URT although little is known about the level of proximity and likelihood of interbacterial effects.Bacterial associations that are detected in epidemio-logical surveys may also indicate the existence of joint host or environmental drivers and not the presence of direct or indirect microbial interactions per se.

Although studies on the composition of the respira- tory tract microbiota did not show substantial differences between different developed countries the question as to whether comparable host and environmental factors regulate the respiratory microbiota of individuals living in lowmiddle-income countries remains an impor- tant open question.
