The mass-to-charge ratio mz will determine the time necessary to travel the flight tube and reach the detector  .

The spread plate technique was also per- formed and 0.1 mL of each water sample was spread in the agar plates.

The colonies were isolated in NA and incubated at 37 degC for 24 h. Pure cultures were preserved at - 80 degC in Nutrient Broth NB Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA supplemented with 15 vv sterile glycerol Amresco Ohio USA.Microbial identificationMALDI-TOF MSFor the identification of microorganisms two protein extraction methods were used according to the instrument manufacturer Shimadzu Corporation Kyoto Japan the Direct Smear plus Formic Acid method and the protein extraction method.

The microbial colony or the protein extraction solution were placed on Fleximasstm DS dis- posable MALDI targets Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc. Columbia MD USA.

The mass range analyzed was set at a mass-to-charge mz ratio of 2000-20000 Da.

The rural study area facilitates a wide range of conventional and unconventional oil and gas activities production wells and waste disposal wells in addition to agricultural activities.

The extreme diversity of energy-generating mechanisms is a unique biochemical characteristic of the Proteobacteria some are chemoorganotrophs e.g.

The detected Pseudomonas species P. aeruginosa P. stutzeri and P. putida may be in- volved in the oxidation of simple or complex organic carbon coupled to nitrate reduction.
