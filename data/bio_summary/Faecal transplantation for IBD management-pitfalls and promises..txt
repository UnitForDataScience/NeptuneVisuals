E-mail Editorial Decision 3 October 2017 Accepted 3 November 2017AbstractBackground Faecal microbiota transplantation FMT as a potential treat- ment for inflammatory bowel disease IBD is an area of active current research having been stimulated by the remarkable efficacy of FMT in treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated colitis.Sources of data This review is based on data from numerous case series on FMT in IBD since 1989 and results of four RCTs in ulcerative colitis UC three fully published.Areas of agreement Early signals of short to medium-term efficacy of FMT for UC are promisingAreas of controversy Methodology underlying mechanisms and questions regarding safety of FMT remain controversial.Growing points Many trials of FMT in adults and children are currently recruiting.Areas timely for developing research Future trials of FMT will likely revisit Crohn's disease and patients undergoing pouch surgery.

The accepted current paradigm to explain the pathogenesis of IBD entails abnormal sensing of the microbiota by the epithelium in genetically suscep- tible individuals resulting in activation of both innate and adaptive immune pathways which causes dam- age to the epithelial barrier.Much information has been garnered concerning the gut microbiome in IBD since the first publica- tion outlining microbiome dysbiosis in IBD as part of the NIH Metahit metagenomics project in 2010.In this it was shown that patients with IBD generally have lower bacterial diversity compared to healthy individuals and that the microbiota in patients with CD and UC segregated from that of healthy individuals.

124IntroductionInflammatory bowel disease IBD largely comprises Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.This chronic affliction of the bowel usually runs a relapsing remitting course and tends to occur in the second or third decade of life affecting people of working and reproductive age.

It should be noted however that one patient in the active treatment arm needed a colectomy due to disease flare raising the potential of disease exacerbation by FMT.

Our developing knowledge concerning dysbiosis in patients with IBD begs the question regarding manipulation of the microbiome as a treatment for IBD.

This along with the 32 remission seen in the patients treated with their own stool suggests that autologous FMT delivered to the jejunum may not be entirely without biological activity.In the most recent 3-centre study from Australiathe investigators took the view that unlike for the treatment of CDI efficacy in the treatment of UC is likely to require an intensive treatment course.

So far there have been several small case series in UC and Crohns disease and three published RCTs in UC evaluating the efficacy of FMT in achieving disease remission and response.

Furthermore diverting the faecal stream in human patients with severe colonic Crohn's disease has long been known to have a healing effect with restoration of bowel continuity resulting in recurrent inflammation.The accepted position and much repeated mantra is 'no microbiota no IBD'.Recent genome wide association searches haveuncovered over 150 potential genes associated with IBD.
