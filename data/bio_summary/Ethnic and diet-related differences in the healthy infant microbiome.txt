using simple linear regression species richness estimates were found to be significantly affected by ethnicity after taking into account breastfeeding at time of collection p  0.05. shannon diversity was significantly affected byethnicity taking into account breastfeeding at time of collection p  0.001 and likewise breastfeeding at time of collection within each ethnicity significantly affected shannon diversity p  0.05. further when start sam- ples all collected within the bramptonpeel region of ontario canada were compared with each study center within the child cohort vancouver edmonton toronto and winnipegwinkler-morden only winnipegwinkler- morden mb had significantly lower species richness esti- mates p  0.05 additional file figure s2.

forward stepwise regression was con- ducted within white caucasians and separately within south asians table this revealed that breastfeeding p  0.01 and infant age p  0.05 were independently associated with differences in the microbiome within each ethnic group while antibiotic use during labor p  0.05 and weight gain in the first year p  0.05 remained independently associated with differences in the microbiome only in white caucasians.

limitations include in- complete data on maternal weight gain during and prior to pregnancy which limits our ability to assess the influence of this important covariate on the infant gut microbiome ethnicity in this study refers to the group a person self- identifies with and reflects a mix of cultural factors including language diet religion and ancestry--thus ethnicity is a multidimensional construct which includes some within-group heterogeneity and differences attribut- able to ethnicity may reflect a broad range of factors which are not purely biological and the lack of a direct measure of infant dietary intake beyond feeding type at the time of stool collection.conclusionsthe infant gut microbiome is influenced by ethnicity and breastfeeding in the first year of life.

while both white caucasian and south asian mothers reported that they breastfed their infants at some point during the first year 97.1 versus 94.4 a greater proportion of south asian infants were still breastfeeding at the time of 1-year stool sample collection 43 versus 32 p  0.05. additionally there was more formula use during the first year 77 versus 65 p  0.001 and earlier introduction of solid food among south asians 88 versus 50 from 3 to 6 months 9.4 versus 40 from 6 to 9 months p time since weaning in months sdcurrently using cow's milk5.6 4.02f7.1 5.85f0.0450.001.

forward step- wise regression was also conducted separately within in- fants breastfed and not breastfed at the time of collection table which indicated that ethnicity p  0.01 and the infant age p  0.05 remained independ- ently associated with differences in the gut microbiome in both groups.differentially abundant genera within each group difference in the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera is presented as a taxa bar chart in add- itional file figure s2 broken down by ethnic group and breastfeeding status.

we then added the most significant covari- ates into the model in order of the proportion of vari- ance explained and stopped when the next most significant covariate was above the 0.05 threshold.the association between genus level abundances and ethnicity andor breastfeeding was determined through a multivariate algorithm adjusting for significant covariates performed with the maaslin package in r  briefly covariates found to be significant p  0.05 pre- dictors of the microbiome described above were in- cluded into a multivariate boosted additive general linear model between covariate data and bacterial genus level abundances.

by including sample sites into the regression model the effect of current breastfeeding on shannon di- versity was no longer significant p  0.054.differences in the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera are presented in additional file figure s3 broken down by ethnic group and breastfeeding status.

several genera within the phylum firmicutes were associated with breastfeeding at the time of collection some were more abundant veillo- nella megasphaera and dialister and others were less abundant blautia unclassified lachospiraceae clostrid- ium ruminococcus coprobacillus lactococcus as well as several unclassified genera within the clostridiales and erysipelotrichales.discussionour results demonstrate that the gut microbiome of in- fants is influenced by ethnicity infant age weight gain and breastfeeding.

however when these var- iables were added as independent predictors of the gut microbiome composition in the multivariable model none except breastfeeding status at the time of samplinginfant age and weight gain in the first year improved the fit of the model ethnicity r2  0.084 versus r2  0.082 with all additional variables breastfeeding status r2 0.040 versus r2  0.032 with all additional variables.

furthermore south asian mothers were youn- ger more likely to be vegetarian 34 versus 2 p  0.001 and to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy 14 versus 4 p  0.001 compared to white caucasian mothers.

we suspect that more south asian infant diets were vegetarian on account of the greater proportion of their mothers who identified as vegetarian 34 versusyes68 57.63e121 67.98b 0.019no50 42.37e57 32.02bcurrently using formulayes47 31.13d72 39.560.026no104 68.87d110 60.44formula in the first yearyes99 63.06c154 90.06c 0.001no58 36.94c17 9.94ctime in months of introduction of solids2 p  0.001. furthermore there was no difference in age at time of stool collection p  0.39 between white caucasians 12.3 - 1.71 months and south asians 12.4 -1.69 months table .abundance of microorganisms within all samplesthe v3 region of 16s rrna genes was profiled from 355 participant stool samples collected at 1 year of age 173 white caucasians from the child cohort and 182 from the start cohort.
