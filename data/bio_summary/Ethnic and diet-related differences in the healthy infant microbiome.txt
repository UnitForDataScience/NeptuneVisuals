Only ethnicity p  0.001 breastfeeding status p  0.001 infant age at stool collection p  0.01 and weight gain in the first year p  0.01 remained in- dependently associated with the gut microbiome as a whole.There was no statistically significant multiplicative interaction between ethnicity and breastfeeding p  0.23.

Forward stepwise regression was con- ducted within white Caucasians and separately within South Asians Table This revealed that breastfeeding p  0.01 and infant age p  0.05 were independently associated with differences in the microbiome within each ethnic group while antibiotic use during labor p  0.05 and weight gain in the first year p  0.05 remained independently associated with differences in the microbiome only in white Caucasians.

The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study CHILD enrolled 3624 mainly white Caucasian mother-child pairs and most fathers from four Canadian centers Vancouver BC Edmonton AB Winnipeg Winkler-Morden MB and Toronto ON to investigate the root causes of allergy and asthma including genetic and environmental triggers and the ways in which they interact - In this analysis ethnicity refers to groups of people who have certain racial cultural reli- gious or other traits in common whereas race refers to a person's physical characteristics such as bone struc- ture or skin hair or eye color  In the CHILD cohort white Caucasian ancestry was confirmed by par- ticipants' response to the question To which ethnic or cultural group did your parents belong The South Asian Birth Cohort START-Canada enrolled 1012 South Asian mother-child pairs from the Brampton and Peel Region of Ontario to investigate the influence of di- verse environmental exposures and genetics on early life adiposity growth trajectory and cardiometabolic factors South Asian ethnicity was verified by the mother's self-report of her and the father's and their parents' an- cestral origin being from India Pakistan Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.Harmonization of clinical data across cohorts wasdone by extracting them with the same definitionswhere possible.

Limitations include in- complete data on maternal weight gain during and prior to pregnancy which limits our ability to assess the influence of this important covariate on the infant gut microbiome ethnicity in this study refers to the group a person self- identifies with and reflects a mix of cultural factors including language diet religion and ancestry--thus ethnicity is a multidimensional construct which includes some within-group heterogeneity and differences attribut- able to ethnicity may reflect a broad range of factors which are not purely biological and the lack of a direct measure of infant dietary intake beyond feeding type at the time of stool collection.ConclusionsThe infant gut microbiome is influenced by ethnicity and breastfeeding in the first year of life.

Shannon diversity was significantly affected byethnicity taking into account breastfeeding at time of collection p  0.001 and likewise breastfeeding at time of collection within each ethnicity significantly affected Shannon diversity p  0.05.

While both white Caucasian and South Asian mothers reported that they breastfed their infants at some point during the first year 97.1 versus 94.4 a greater proportion of South Asian infants were still breastfeeding at the time of 1-year stool sample collection 43 versus 32 p  0.05.

Forward step- wise regression was also conducted separately within in- fants breastfed and not breastfed at the time of collection Table which indicated that ethnicity p  0.01 and the infant age p  0.05 remained independ- ently associated with differences in the gut microbiome in both groups.Differentially abundant genera within each group Difference in the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera is presented as a taxa bar chart in Add- itional file Figure S2 broken down by ethnic group and breastfeeding status.

South Asian infants were born earlier 39.1 weeks versus 39.5 weeks p  0.05 had lower birth weight 3.3 kg versus 3.5 kg p  0.001 and gained more weight in the first year of life 7.1 kg gained versus 6.4 kg gained p  0.001 than did white Caucasian infants.

Additionally an in- crease in the abundance of several genera within the phylum Firmicutes were associated with not being breastfed at the time of sampling.Bifidobacteria along with the LAB are known to be abundant members of the microbiome of breastfeeding infants  whereas genera within the order Clostri- diales are known to be more abundant within the gut of adults  Here bacterial profiles indicative of a breast milk diet were common among South Asians even those that were not breastfeeding at the time of collection suggesting that these infants retain more of a breastfeed- ing microbiome than do white Caucasians of the same age.
