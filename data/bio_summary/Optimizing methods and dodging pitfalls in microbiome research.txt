When the microbiota from these protected male mice was transplanted into younger female mice the same protection against type 1 diabetes was seen A study of an anti-psychotic drug on weight and gut microbiota in male and female rats reported that drug treatment induced significant weight gain in female rats only Microbial circadian rhythms in mice were re- ported to differ between sexes  Sex differences in microbiota have also been reported in macaques Remarkably even sexual preference among men has been linked to gut microbiome differences which may be a confounding factor in studies of gut micro- biome and HIV infection where controls were not matched by sexual preference.Other studies have investigated whether pets influence the human microbiome and vice versa One group showed that cohabiting adults shared more similar skin microbiota if they owned a dog .How each of these factors will influence any given microbiome study is dependent on the question asked and the strengths of differences between study groups.

The healthy human adult gut is known to be largely stable in microbial composition over time -and a perturbation in such stability--dysbiosis--has been asso- ciated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease  However the microbiome of other sites likethe human vagina can vary on short-time scales without necessarily indicating dysbiosis - Even the gut microbiome has been reported to display circadian be- havior on a 24-h cycle Thus for studies of a new sample type it is essential to understand longitu- dinal variation in order to acquire samples that address the question posed.Different batches of DNA extraction kit reagents can be a significant source of variation for longitudinal studies It is wise to purchase all the extraction kits needed at the start of the study or store samples and extract all at the same time to minimize the effects of this variable.Cage effects in animal experimentsCage effects can derail microbiome studies in mice and may be important for other laboratory animals as well.

Bushman2 and Kyle Bittinger1BackgroundStudies of microbial communities--the microbiome--have become quite popular in recent years.

Several approaches tailored to microbiome research have been reported  .Consider the influence of factors such as antibiotic use age sex diet geography and pet ownershipThe human microbiome is sensitive to its environment which can considerably confound associating any par- ticular condition or intervention with a change in micro- biota composition.

Drug use diet age geography pet ownership and sex have all been reported to influence function and composition -In 2008 Relman and colleagues documented effects of antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiome and many subsequent studies have also reported effects -It has further been sug- gested that additional prescription drugs can affect microbiome analyses For example Imhann et al.

Other challenges mentioned below include changes associated with sample storage microbial sharing among animals during cohous- ing and authentic longitudinal microbial instability in the body site of a host animal.The goal of this article is to catalog major challenges in microbiome research and to outline approaches to address them.

This review is intended to help our collaborators and other microbiome researchers wrestling with these issues.

We will focus primarily on la- boratory work important for microbiome analysis and touch on computational and statistical methods only briefly.

We focus here on studies of the vertebrate microbiome and break out points that are specific to studies of humans and model organisms.

We present sections in an order that matches the progres- sion of performing an experiment--the paper begins with study design continues with sample collection and process- ing and concludes with analysis.Planning a microbiome experimentIt is essential to plan carefully to ensure that the experi- ment carried out will answer the question posed.
