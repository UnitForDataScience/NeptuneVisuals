Vibrio vulnificus is a striking and enigmatic human pathogen yet many aspects related to its biology genomics virulence capabilities and epidemiology remain elusive and poorly understood.

Vibrio vulnificus is a serious human pathogen responsible for over 95 of seafood- related deaths in the United States Jones and Oliver 2009 and carries the highest fatality rate of any food- borne pathogen Rippey 1994.

Vibrio vulnificus is currently subdivided into three biotypes based on genomic biochemical and serological features as well as host range Tison et al.

Vibrio vulnificus is known to enter a viable butnonculturable state at temperatures below 138C thus the inability to culture the organism at low temperatures does not necessarily mean the cells are not present Oliver 2015.

Seasonal distribution of Vibrio vulnificus cases reported in the USA 1988-2010 compared to average Gulf of Mexico Sea Surface Temperature.

Vibrio vulnificus carries the highest mor- tality rate of any foodborne pathogen Rippey 1994.
