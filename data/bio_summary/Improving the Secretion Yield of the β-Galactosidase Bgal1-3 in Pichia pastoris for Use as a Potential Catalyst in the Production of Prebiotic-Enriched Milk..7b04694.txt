the low secretion efficiency of inu1a indicates that this signal peptide from the yeast k. marxious does not work well in the bgal1-3 secretion process which is very different from the efficient secretion of human a-antitrypsin from s. cerevisiae directed by the same signal peptide.signal peptide hfbi has a similar length and sequence features to those of apre which may explain their similar secretion efficiencies .the most efficient signal peptide for bgal1-3 secretion was w1 a synthetic signal peptide based on proposed signal design rules.it contains a positively charged n-terminus of three r followed by a three-residue spacer from the aox1 promoter aip a hydrophobic core of 11 repeated l and a c-terminus comprising the preregion of a-factor ssala.

five signal peptides were chosen including a modified a-factor mf4ithe preregion of a-factor aprea signal peptide from trichoderma reesei hfbia signal peptide from kluyveromyces marxious inu1aand a synthetic signal peptide w1.the coding sequences of these signal peptides were optimized using the optigene platform generay biotechnology which is shown in .

for some proteins secretion could only be achieved when the proregion was present in the signal peptide.for other proteins however more efficient secretion was achieved when the proregion partial was deleted.in addition modification of the proregion can also enhance the secretion of some proteins.

thus systematic optimization of the signal peptide based on w1 is ongoing in our lab and may further expand the potential of synthetic signal peptides.multicopy integration of the bgal1-3 gene toimprove its secretion yield.

signal peptides play a crucial role in protein secretion in p. pastoris but it is hard to predict the secretory efficiencies of different signal peptides for a specific recombinant protein.

by contrast deletion of the proregion signal peptide apre improved the secretion yield from 4.4 to 5.8 uml meaning that this region has a negative effect on bgal1-3 secretion.

in a previous study on the secretion of an acidic phytase introduction of thespacer aip into the a-factor signal peptide significantly improved its secretion yield from 15 to 40 mgl.
