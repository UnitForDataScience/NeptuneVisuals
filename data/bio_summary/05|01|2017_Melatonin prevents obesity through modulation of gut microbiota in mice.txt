Depleting gut microbiota prevents obesity and stimulates the browning of WAT in obese mice.63 In our model melatonin decreases the OUT number and reduces the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota which to some extent may support the above hypothesis.In conclusion our results show that melatonin treatment modulates the gut microbiota promoting a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and increasing the rel- ative abundance of Akkermansia while bringing the abun- dances of Alistipes Anaerotruncus and Desulfovibrionaceae back to normal levels thereby providing beneficial effects against obesity insulin resistance liver steatosis and low- grade inflammation in HFD-fed mice.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China NO.

Published by John Wiley  Sons Ltd 1 of 13Increasing evidence indicates that the changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.9 Moreover genetic- and dietary-induced obese rodents showed large increases in their FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio.1011 Transplanting the gut microbiota isolated from high fat diet HFD-induced obese donors to germ-free animals led to a significant increase in body weight and metabolic syndrome in the recipient mice.12 The positive effect of gut microbiota on energy metabolism and nutrient acquisition may have the potential to prevent obesity.Melatonin or N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine is a nat- ural molecule widely present in animals plants bacteria fungi and eukaryotic protists.13-17 In mammals including humans pineal melatonin is a natural hormone secreted from the pineal gland situated in the brain.

In our obese mouse model melatonin treatment signifi- cantly reduces body weight gain fat mass and epididymalmean adipocyte size to approximately the control levels Figure 1 and Figure 2A-C. As already mentioned the gut microbiota of obese humans and rodent models is highly associated with decreased abundances of Bacteroidetes and increased abundances of Firmicutes.101145 Our results show that melatonin supplementation significantly increases the abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of Firmicutes in HFD-fed mice Figure 5IJ.

As shown in Figure 5L-N all three groups presented a distinct clustering of microbiota composition and the HFDM group had a similar structure to that of the HFD group.Melatonin modulates the key phylotypes of gut microbiota in HFD-fed miceTo identify the gut microbiota phylotypes responding to mel- atonin supplementation we analyzed the effective sequences of all samples by redundancy analysis RDA.

The relative abundances of Alistipes5152and Anaerotruncus50 have been correlated with obesity and its associated meta- bolic disorders in previous studies and their abundances were also restored by melatonin in HFD-fed mice Figure 7B-C. Melatonin protects against metabolic dysfunction and oxida- tive molecular damage in the hepatobiliary and gastrointesti- nal tract system.5354 Helicobacter marmotae is considered to be associated with enterohepatic disease.55 It was reversed by melatonin in HFD-fed mice in the present study Figure 7D.

Through the gut microbiota profiling our results indicate that melatonin induces a substantial change in gut microbiota composi- tion suggesting a potential mechanism by which melatonin reduces obesity and its related disorders.MATERIALS AND METHODS Drug and dietsMelatonin M5250 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich St Louis MO USA.

We assessed the effects of melatonin onFIGURE 5Responses of the diversity richness and structure of the gut microbiota to melatonin during the treatment of obesity in mice.

Collectively these results indicate that melatonin treatment reverses HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis.DISCUSSION Gut microbiota is closely correlated with obesity.

Many studies have been reported that melatonin attenuated inflammatory response and oxi- dative stress by inhibited NFkB activation59-61 which wasexplored in rat skeletal muscle by increasing IkBa content and decreasing IkBa phosphorylation and IkB kinase a.62 Additionally in HFD-fed mice circulating TG TC blood glucose and insulin levels increased significantly while the administration of melatonin produced a protective effect and counteracted the increased insulin resistance in obese mice Figure 3.Brown adipose tissue BAT which expends energy to produce heat regulates insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis and promotes a lean and healthy phenotype.6364 Several in vivo studies have shown that melatonin treatment regulates the energy metabolism by stimulating BAT and WAT browning.2565-67 In the present study we observed that melatonin administration increases the expression of UCP1 at both the gene and protein levels enhances fatty acid trans- port and catabolism and promotes thermogenesis Figure 4.
