Depleting gut microbiota prevents obesity and stimulates the browning of WAT in obese mice.63 In our model melatonin decreases the OUT number and reduces the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota which to some extent may support the above hypothesis.In conclusion our results show that melatonin treatment modulates the gut microbiota promoting a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and increasing the rel- ative abundance of Akkermansia while bringing the abun- dances of Alistipes Anaerotruncus and Desulfovibrionaceae back to normal levels thereby providing beneficial effects against obesity insulin resistance liver steatosis and low- grade inflammation in HFD-fed mice.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China NO.

Published by John Wiley  Sons Ltd 1 of 13Increasing evidence indicates that the changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.9 Moreover genetic- and dietary-induced obese rodents showed large increases in their FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio.1011 Transplanting the gut microbiota isolated from high fat diet HFD-induced obese donors to germ-free animals led to a significant increase in body weight and metabolic syndrome in the recipient mice.12 The positive effect of gut microbiota on energy metabolism and nutrient acquisition may have the potential to prevent obesity.Melatonin or N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine is a nat- ural molecule widely present in animals plants bacteria fungi and eukaryotic protists.13-17 In mammals including humans pineal melatonin is a natural hormone secreted from the pineal gland situated in the brain.

Through the gut microbiota profiling our results indicate that melatonin induces a substantial change in gut microbiota composi- tion suggesting a potential mechanism by which melatonin reduces obesity and its related disorders.MATERIALS AND METHODS Drug and dietsMelatonin M5250 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich St Louis MO USA.

As shown in Figure 5L-N all three groups presented a distinct clustering of microbiota composition and the HFDM group had a similar structure to that of the HFD group.Melatonin modulates the key phylotypes of gut microbiota in HFD-fed miceTo identify the gut microbiota phylotypes responding to mel- atonin supplementation we analyzed the effective sequences of all samples by redundancy analysis RDA.

We assessed the effects of melatonin onFIGURE 5Responses of the diversity richness and structure of the gut microbiota to melatonin during the treatment of obesity in mice.

Collectively these results indicate that melatonin treatment reverses HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis.DISCUSSION Gut microbiota is closely correlated with obesity.

Differences were assessed by ANOVA and denoted as followsP.05 P.01 compared with normal chow diet NCD P.05P.01 compared with HFDMelatonin alters the gut microbiota composition in HFD-induced miceThe interaction between HFD feeding and gut microbiota has been suggested to be involved in the above obesity-associated metabolic disorder.

Therefore whether melatonin as a probiotic prevents obesity by modulating the gut microbiota is still unknown.
