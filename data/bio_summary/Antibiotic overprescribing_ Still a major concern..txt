Researchers analyzed data from 2005 to 2010 Na- tional Ambulatory Medical Care Sur- veys NAMCS and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys NHAMCS and found that more than half of the patients received prescrip- tions for antibiotics but that there was no overall difference in antibiotic pre- scriptions between primary care and ED presentation.18A retrospective analysis that exam- ined antibiotic prescribing found that between 2006 and 2010 outpa- tient hospital practices 56 and community-practice offices 60 prescribed more antibiotics for ARTIs than EDs 51.12Stick to narrow-spectrum agents when possibleUsing broad-spectrum antibiotics suchTABLE 1Known and potential harms of antibiotic overprescribing1-6We should pause before prescribing drugs that can alter our microbiome in complex and only partially understood ways.as quinolones or imipenem first line contributes more to the problem of an- tibiotic resistance than does prescrib- ing narrow-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin cephalexin or trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole.7 Yet between 2007 and 2009 broad-spectrum agents were pre- scribed for 61 of outpatient adult visits in which patients received an antibiotic pre- scription.17 Quinolones 25 macrolides 20 and aminopenicillins 12 were most commonly prescribed and antibiotic prescriptions were most often written for re- spiratory conditions such as bronchitis for which we now know antibiotics are rarely indicated.17Between 2006 and 2008 pediatric pa- tients who received antibiotic prescriptions were given broad-spectrum agents 50 of the time of which macrolides were the class most commonly prescribed.13More recently researchers examined the frequency with which physicians prescribe narrow-spectrum first-line antibiotics for otitis media sinusitis and pharyngitis using 2010 to 2011 NAMCSNHAMCS data.

Respondents also reported that other physi- cians were responsible for inappropriate an- tibiotic prescribing.33Strategies that workSome early intervention programs directed at reducing antibiotic prescribing demon- strated success TABLE 2.34-36 One example comes from a 1996 to 1998 study of 4 primary care practices.34 Researchers evaluated theMonthly emails to physicians comparing their prescribing habits to peers and top performers reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.TABLE 3Tips for maintaining patientparent satisfaction without prescribing antibiotics93738Patients and parents reported higher satisfaction with physicians who explained why antibiotics were not indicated vs physicians who simply prescribed them.impact of a multidimensional intervention effort targeted at clinicians and patients and aimed at lowering the use of antimicrobial agents for acute uncomplicated bronchitis in adults.

Why do we overprescribe antibiotics A 2015 systematic literature review found that patient demand pharmaceutical company marketing activities limited up-to-date infor- mation sources and physician fear of losing their patients are major reasons physicians cite for prescribing antibiotics.32In a separate study that explored anti- biotic prescribing habits for acute bronchi- tis33 clinicians cited patient demand as the major reason for prescribing antibiotics.

Studies conducted in Tennessee and Wisconsin that combined prescriber and community education about unnecessary antibiotics for children found that the intervention reduced antibiotic prescribing in both locations by about 19 compared with about a 9 reduction in the control groups.3637Does prescribing antibiotics affect patient satisfactionThe results are mixed as to whether prescrib- ing antibiotics affects patient satisfaction.

Two studies in the early 2000s found that both patients and parents reported higher satisfac- tion with physicians who explained why anti- biotics were not indicated vs physicians who simply prescribed them and that such expla- nations do not need to take a lot of time.3738 See TABLE 393738 for patient care tips.A more recent study found that higher antibiotic prescribing practices in Britain were associated with modestly higher pa- tient satisfaction ratings.39 The authors of this study noted however that reduced antibiotic prescribing may be a proxy for other practice patterns that affected satisfaction ratings.Reducing antibiotic prescribing reduces resistanceThere is also strong evidence that when phy- sicians decrease antibiotic prescribing anti- microbial resistance follows suit.

And yet physicians continue to overprescribe this class of medication.A 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report estimates that at least 30 of antibiotics prescribed in US outpatient settings are unnecessary.7 Another report cites a slightly higher figure across a variety of health care settings.8 Pair these findings with the fact that there are currently few new drugs in development to target resistant bacteria and you have the potential for a post-antibiotic era in which common infections could become lethal.7In 2003 the CDC launched its Get Smart Know When Antibiotics Work program focused on decreasing inappro- priate antibiotic use in the outpatient setting.9 In 2014 the White House released the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria with a goal of decreasing inap- propriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 and inappropriate inpatient use by 20 by 2020.10 And on an international level the World Health Organization WHO developed a 5-year strategic framework in 2015 for implementing its Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance.11Family practitioners are on the front lines of this battle.Here's what we can do now.When and where are antibiotics most often inappropriately prescribedThe diagnosis leading to the most frequent inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics is acute respiratory tract infection ARTI which includes bronchitis otitis media pharyngitisUp to 40 of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections are unnecessary.sinusitis tonsillitis the common cold and pneumonia.

They found that physicians used first-line agents recommended by professional guidelines 52 of the time although it was estimated that they would have been appropriate in 80 of cases pediatric patients were more likely to receive appropriate first-line antibiotics than adult patients.19 Macrolides especially azithromycin were the most common non- first-line antibiotics prescribed.1920 The bot- tom line is that when antibiotics are indicated for upper respiratory infections otitis media sinusitis and pharyngitis physicians should prescribe a narrow-spectrum antibiotic first.Antibiotic overprescribing affects the gut and beyondThe human intestinal microbiome is com- posed of a diverse array of bacteria viruses and parasites.21 The main functions of the gut microbiome include interacting with the im- mune system and participating in biochemi- cal reactions in the gut such as absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of vitamin K.As we know antibiotics decrease the diversity of gut bacteria which in turn can cause less efficient nutrient extraction as well as a vulnerability to enteric infections.21 It is well known for example that the bacterial gut microbiome can either inhibit or promote diarrheal illnesses such as those caused by C. difficile.
