Although we cannot rule out the possibility that under inflammatory conditions immune cells other than the ones we assessed DCs macrophages natural killer cells neutrophils group 3 innate lymphoid cells T cells and B cells might acquire IFNLR1 expression and responsiveness to IFN-l in vivo overall our data indicated that IFN-l signaling in neutrophils mediated the diminished colon shortening tissue damage and oxidative stress.Because IFN-l has a critical role in modifying epithelial-cellresponses341936 we induced DSS-mediated colitis in irradiatedWT-WT WT-IFNLR1-KOb 10WT-WTc 6 WT-IFNLR1-KOWT-WT WT-IFNLR1-KOdWT-WTWT-IFNLR1-KO10584100NS6295901 2 3 4 5 6 7Time d40UTDSSefghi0.030.020.010.00NSWT-WT WT-IFNLR1-KO1.00.80.60.40.20.0NSWT-WT WT-IFNLR1-KO0.0150.0100.0050.000WT-WT WT-IFNLR1-KO864UT DSS8Ifnlr1flfl6VilcreIfnlr1flfl420Ifnlr1flflVilcreIfnlr1flfljkIfnlr1flflVilcreIfnlr1flfl864NS 3Ifnlr1flflVilcreIfnlr1flfl422100Figure 6 The protective effect of IFN-l in DSS-induced colitis is independent of IFNLR1 expression in epithelial cells.

To generate mice with hematopoietic- specific deletion of Ifnlr1 8-week-old female CD45.1 mice were exposed to lethal whole-body irradiation 950 rads per mouse and were reconstituted with 5 x 106 bone marrow cells from 8-week-old female wild-type or IFNLR1-deficient mice.

In this case recipient wild-type or IFNLR1-deficient mice underwent irradiation and were reconstituted with BM cells derived from CD45.1 mice under the same conditions described above.To evaluate the percentage of chimerism a 30-ul sample of peripheral blood was takenfrom chimeric mice after 4 weeks of reconstitution.
