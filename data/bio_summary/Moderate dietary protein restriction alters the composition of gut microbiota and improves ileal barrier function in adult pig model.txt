The moderate dietary protein restriction 13 CP may be preferred by pork industry which introduces a new strategy to improve the health of animal gut health because it did not damage the intestinal morphology and could improve the epithelial barrier function and develop a healthier pattern of ileal bacterial community.ConclusionsIn conclusion moderate reduction of dietary protein concentration 13 CP could improve the bacte- rial community structure in both ileum and colon of finishing pigs especially increase the proportion of Peptostreptococcaceae and enhance the ileal barrier function.

With development and application of high throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing it may help to explain the underlying mechanism on comprehensive variation of intestinal bacteria caused by various concentrations of dietary protein.In the present study the finishing pigs were selected as the experimental model and the effects of reducing dietary protein level by different percentage on the gut health from perspective of gut microbiota intestinal bar- rier function and proliferation of intestinal stem cells were investigated.

The influence of different dietary CP levels on the intestinal bacterial com- munities have been widely studied in weaned piglets however the balance of intestinal microbiota has not been well established yet.

The 10 CP dietary treatment damaged ileal mucosal morphology and decreased the expression of biomarks of intestinal cells Lgr5 and Bmi1 whereas the expression of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin in 13 CP group were higher than the other two groups.

The weight gain of finishing pigs in 13 CP group mean of final body weight 97.88 kg showed no significant P 0.05 difference with those in 16 CP group mean of final body weight 101.43 kg whereas the weight gain 10 CP group mean of final body weight 94.02 kg were significantly P  0.05 lower than those in 16 CP group.

No significant difference was observed in expressions of ileal Lgr5 and Bmi1 between 16 CP and 13 CP group but expression of Lgr5 in 10 CP group was significantly lower than the other two groups P  0.02 and Bmi1 in 10 CP group was lower than 16 CP group P  0.04.

Compared to 16 and 13 CP dietary treatments ileal tissue in 10 CP dietary treatment showed shorter villus height P  0.04 and deeper crypt depth P  0.03 3c.Table 3.

And as reported Peptostreptococcaceae is usually considered as normal commensal bacteria and its proportion is higher in gut microbiota of health animals than those patients with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota indicating Peptostreptococcaceae helps maintain the gut homeostasis.In consistent with healthier pattern of ileal bacterial community in 13 CP group ileal expression of two important intestinal tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 were both up regulated when the dietary protein concentration decreased by 3 percent.

Meanwhile Shannon index of bacterial community in either ileal or colon was barely affected by reduction of protein concentration e. However within-group difference of Shannon index in 13 CP group was smaller than the other two groups.The OTU community comparisons by hierarchical clustering showed that samples from ileal and colon clus- tered and most of ileal samples in 16 CP dietary treatment were separated from of those in 10 CP group but colonic samples did not cluster clearly according to the protein concentration .

Expression of ileal claudin-1 in 13 CP group was significantly higher than 16 CP and 10 CP group P  0.01 and reducing the dietary protein concentration by 3 percent from 16 increased the expression of occludin P  0.04.
