With development and application of high throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing it may help to explain the underlying mechanism on comprehensive variation of intestinal bacteria caused by various concentrations of dietary protein.In the present study the finishing pigs were selected as the experimental model and the effects of reducing dietary protein level by different percentage on the gut health from perspective of gut microbiota intestinal bar- rier function and proliferation of intestinal stem cells were investigated.

The moderate dietary protein restriction 13 CP may be preferred by pork industry which introduces a new strategy to improve the health of animal gut health because it did not damage the intestinal morphology and could improve the epithelial barrier function and develop a healthier pattern of ileal bacterial community.ConclusionsIn conclusion moderate reduction of dietary protein concentration 13 CP could improve the bacte- rial community structure in both ileum and colon of finishing pigs especially increase the proportion of Peptostreptococcaceae and enhance the ileal barrier function.

The influence of different dietary CP levels on the intestinal bacterial com- munities have been widely studied in weaned piglets however the balance of intestinal microbiota has not been well established yet.

Pig fed diets included normal dietary protein concentration group 16 low dietary protein concentration group 13 and extremely low dietary protein concentration group 10 respectively.

The 10 CP dietary treatment damaged ileal mucosal morphology and decreased the expression of biomarks of intestinal cells Lgr5 and Bmi1 whereas the expression of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin in 13 CP group were higher than the other two groups.

And as reported Peptostreptococcaceae is usually considered as normal commensal bacteria and its proportion is higher in gut microbiota of health animals than those patients with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota indicating Peptostreptococcaceae helps maintain the gut homeostasis.In consistent with healthier pattern of ileal bacterial community in 13 CP group ileal expression of two important intestinal tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 were both up regulated when the dietary protein concentration decreased by 3 percent.

As for colonic content when dietary protein concentration decreased from 16 to 13 concentration of acetate propionate and isobutyrate declined significantly P  0.01 and when dietary protein concentration continued to decrease at 10 concentration of butyrate and isovalerate also dropped down P  0.01.

When dietary protein concentration reduced by 3 per- cent concentration of all the 5 biogenic amines in ileal content and putrescine histamine and spermidine in colonic content were significantly decreased P  0.05 4 but when the concentration of dietary protein reduced to 10 only concentration of ileal histamine and colonic methylamine continued to decrease signifi- cantly P  0.05.Intestinal morphology.

Compared to 16 and 13 CP dietary treatments ileal tissue in 10 CP dietary treatment showed shorter villus height P  0.04 and deeper crypt depth P  0.03 3c.Table 3.
