The operating principle of the LBRs involved has been further detailed by .Substrate collection and experimental conditionsThree conditions were tested two reactors were inoculated with a mixture of digestate and leachate and were operated under mesophilic 37 degC or thermophilic 55 degC conditions Minoc and Tinoc respectively a third reactor was started up in thermophilic conditions but without specific inoculation Tno inoc.

As a consequence about 7.9 of the methane is not converted into electrical power in thermophilic conditions compared to the 2.3 in a mesophilic environment.The digestion of spent cow bedding a slowly-degradable sub- strate was compared at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions.

Comparison of thermophilic conditions with Tinoc and without Tno inoc solid digestate in run 1 and run 2 a specific methane production rate b VFA concentration.the peaks reached was related to the use of two different spent bedding samples whereas after 15 days the SMP rates for both runs and conditions were similar.b presents the methane yield MY for both temperature conditions and runs.

In mesophilic conditions the CHP is operated at its Pnom for a longer than in thermophilic conditions i.e.

As a consequence a better exploitation of the biogasenergy can be achieved in mesophilic conditions since gelec is thehighest at Pnom whereas it decreases for lower powers.To sum up higher methane production rates in thermophilic conditions during the first days of the batch process are proved to induce on one hand the loss of a part of the biogas produced because the CHP power limits are overtaken and on the other hand a poorer exploitation of the biogas's combustion power due to variable electrical efficiency.

Based on this simulation it is estimated that 5.9 less electrical energy is produced in ther- mophilic conditions 1.84 106 kW helec as opposed to mesophilic conditions 1.95 106 kW helec on a annual basis.

It means that if 80 of the potential energy were recovered which seems economically important for a processtreating only spent cow bedding then thermophilic temperatures would not offer any advantage over mesophilic temperatures.In batch digesters fed with corn stover and operated at 20 TS also reported similar MY in thermophilic and mesophilic conditions after 38-45 days of operation.

Indeed when comparing the influence of mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures several authors agreed on the faster degradation kinetics when using thermophilic conditions to treat different sub- strates such as spent horse bedding  the organic fraction of municipal solid waste   spent cow bedding  vegetable waste mixed to wood chips   and cow dung .

In thermophilic conditions the first authors observed higher kinetics and methane yield than at mesophilic temperature while the second reported higher kinetics and a lower methane yield.
