We characterized the skin microbiota ofnaive pre-WNS little brown bats Myotis lucifugus from three WNS-negative hibernation sites and persisting previously exposed bats from three WNS-positive sites to test the hypothesis that the skin microbiota of bats shifts following WNS invasion.Results Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing on 66 bats and 11 environmental samples we found that hibernation site strongly influenced the composition and diversity of the skin microbiota.

First we predicted that bats persist- ing in WNS-affected sites would exhibit reduced di- versity of their microbiota consistent with strong selection for a subset of pre-WNS microbial species Second we predicted that the microbiota of persisting bats from WNS-affected sites would show a proportional increase in antifungalanti-Pd bacter- ial species such as those identified in previous studies  We also tested the third hypoth- esis that variation in the skin microbiota of hiberna- ting bats relates to environmental variation in the microbial community of a given cave.

We predicted that the diversity and composition of the microbial community living on individual bats would be similar to that found on substrates in the local en- vironment of their hibernaculum and would differ from that on bats and the local environment in other hibernacula.MethodsSampling and ethicsDuring winter 2015-2016 we sampled the skin micro- biota of 33 M. lucifugus from three WNS-negative hiber- nacula in central Manitoba Canada about 50 km north of the town of Grand Rapids 53deg 30' N 99deg 24' W and another 33 individuals from three sites known to be WNS-positive since 2010 in Quebec Canada within 60 km north of Gatineau city 45deg 28' N 75deg 42' W. The temperature within sites ranged from -3 to 7 degC at sampling time.

WNS-positive sites had significantly lower Shannon di- versity than WNS-negative sites Fig.

The PCoA based on unweighted UniFrac revealed a clear separation between WNS-positive sites in Quebec and WNS-negative sites in Manitoba and also grouped samples from within the same hibernacu- lum Fig.

Weighted UniFrac distances accounting for abundance of taxa revealed similar patterns with WNS status explaining 14 sites explaining 26 and cluster explaining 30 of the variation in the microbiota samples Table In light of these results we conducted partial RDA to better distinguish the relative influence of our three explanatory models Table This analysis revealed that WNS status explained no variation after controlling for sites andor clustering.

Taken together the results ofsimple and partial db-RDA analyses suggest that sites combined with a local effect of bat clustering within sites contribute to shaping the skin microbiota whereas WNS status have much less influence.We next used unweighted and weighted UniFrac to explore the relationship between skin microbiota sam- ples and environmental samples collected at each site.

In both cases when variation of one model was controlled for using partial db-RDA the ability of the models to explain variation in microbial community composition was slightly increased by 1 Table These results suggest that both sample type and sites models had a non-redundant influence on microbial community variation and that the local environment is an important factor explaining skin microbiota patterns of hibernating bats in our study sites.Taxonomic indicators of WNS statusWe found that the most abundant bacterial taxa were shared among all hibernacula but we also identified indicator taxa present more often and more abundant at particular sites.
