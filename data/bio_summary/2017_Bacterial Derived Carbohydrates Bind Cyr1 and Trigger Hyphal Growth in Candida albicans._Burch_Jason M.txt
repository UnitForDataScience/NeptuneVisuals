Finally using a surface plasma resonance SPR assay previously developed in our lab to characterize the NOD2-MDP interaction-we characterize the ability of the LRR domain to bind a subset of bacterial derived carbohydrates.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA binding assay for a LRR containing protein Nod2 and apeptidoglycan fragment was established in our laboratory.InFigure 3.

The development of this assay will allow for the potential identification of compounds that inhibit carbohydrate binding and subsequent hyphae formation ultimately leading to novel therapeutics which can be coadministered with antibiotics or chemotherapeutics to prevent systemic C. albicans infections.For full experimental details regarding materials synthetic protocols protein expression and purification SPR procedures and the hyphal activation assay refer to the .Synthesis of MTP.

A hexahistidine-tagged maltose- binding protein MBP fusion protein which is known to increase protein solubility was added to the N-terminus.

Minima at 208 and 222 nM indicated that the fusion protein contained high a-helical character consistent with the structure of the LRR domain of homologous proteins.To ensure that secondary structure was conserved during the refolding process a CD spectrum of MBP-LRR that was expressed in the soluble fraction was obtained and compared to the spectrum of the refolded protein  .

A Preincubation with 4 reduced binding to 3 by 49.5 and 4 by 54.5 B 3 reduced binding to 3 by 43.7 and 4 by 49.5 C 1 reduced binding to 3 by 44.6 and 4 by 41.5 and D 2 reduced binding to 3 by 61.4 and 4 by66.9.denaturerenature purification procedure Cyr1's LRR was obtained in large quantity and high purity.With the purified protein in hand an assay was developed todetermine if the compounds capable of inducing hyphae growth  could bind to the LRR domain of Cyr1.

albicans is a dimorphic fungus capable of growing as budding yeast or as filamentous hyphae.It is the hyphae form which allows C. albicans to form biofilmsand become invasive by either endocytosis by the host cell or active penetration of the plasma membrane by the hyphae.

The protein mixture was applied to the SPR chip and the response was compared to apo protein.

The protein was applied to the SPR chip and the response was recorded and compared to the response levels of the apo Cyr1- LRR.

showed that DNA topoisomerase inhibitors specifically anthracyclines altered the morphology of C. albicans.The ability of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin 2  to induce C. albicans hyphae formation is intriguing as the compounds are natural products produced by Streptomycespeucetius and contain the L-sugar daunosamine 3 .

Our laboratory has developed a surface plasmon resonance SPR assay which has been used to measure the binding of bacterial peptidoglycan fragments to the LRR domain of the innate immune receptor NOD2.This assay was modified todetermine the affinity of the LRR from Cyr1 to the bacterialderived carbohydrates.
