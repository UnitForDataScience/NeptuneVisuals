Given their role in the immune system pathogens have evolved to increase their virulence by modulating their signals to PRRs.54 Recent studies report that both PAMPs and EVs released from infected cells and pathogens are likely to be involved in immune re- sponses.55EVs are released by diverse cell types that have been implicat- ed in allergic responses such as bronchial epithelial cells mast cells dendritic cells and T cells in the lung.56 Bronchial epithe- lial cells are the primary producers of EVs in the lungs of pa- tients with asthma.57 Interestingly it was found that IL-13-stim- ulated bronchial epithelial cells released EVs that promoted proliferation of macrophages but reduction in EV secretion seemed to ameliorate asthmatic features.

We expect that current efforts to under- stand the airway microbiome membership in detail will help reveal a mechanistic link between the microbiota and asthma.Gut microbiota and asthmaThe airway microbiota can shape lung-specific immune re- sponses resulting in either homeostatic or detrimental inflam- mation.

Pathogenic and beneficial bacteria associated with allergic inflamma- tionmoniae have also been associated with childhood asthma.25 However not all bacteria in the airway aggravate the severity of asthma for example Lactobacillus rhamnosus has protective effects against respiratory infection.26 Specific bacteria seem to modulate allergic inflammation however whether a single bacterial species can induce allergic disease is still unclear.Recent studies have revealed that the composition of the mi- crobiota residing in the lung can be more important in allergic diseases than the simple presence of individual species.

Germ-free GF mice presented strong allergic inflammation compared to specific pathogen-free SPF mice through OVA sensitization and challenge.45 Specific bacteria like Lactobacillus reuteri ex- hibited the protective effects of inducing regulatory T Treg cell expansion and reducing inflammation in response to OVA challenge in sensitized BALBc mice.46 Treatment with Clostrid- ium strains produced similar effects on Treg cells in the colonic mucosa and reduced IgE levels after OVA sensitization.47 Inter- estingly segmented filamentous bacteria induced Th17 cell ex- pansion which mediates mucosal defense in the lamina pro- pria.48 However a recent study found that direct ingestion of certain bacteria was insufficient to induce significant changes in immune function.Experimental feeding of different dietary components indi- cated that dietary changes could affect allergic inflammation by modifying the microbiota composition.

In contrast some studies have reported that EVs can inhibit Th2 response-associated cytokine production IgE response and even prevent the development of asthma.62 While immune cells mediate immune responses non-immune cells such as bacte- ria also have important roles in activating immune responses.

It has become clear that microbial community dysbiosis correlates with asthma.3132 Diverse bacterial commu- nities reside in the airway and altered composition of these mi- crobiota might contribute to allergic inflammation in asthma.Clinical studies of corticosteroid inhalation suggest that the airway microbiota affects corticosteroid responsiveness among asthmatic patients.33 Bacterial community profiles of corticoste- roid-sensitive or -resistant asthmatics were not well discerned but Haemophilus parainfluenzae was observed in some of the corticosteroid-resistant asthmatics.

This interest in GI microbes stemmed from an observed inverse relationship between rate of childhood asthma and exposure to bacteria in infancy.35-38 Moreover infants who develop asthma have presented relative- ly few lactobacillus and bifidobacteria and relatively many en- terococcus.39-41 Further studies indicate that the gut microbiota influences the maturation of immune function in early life through the oral ingestion of environmental bacteria.42-44Studies in mice also provide strong evidence of the role of gut microbiota in the regulation of immune function.

However it remains to be deter- mined how changes in the gut microbiota affect lung immunity.EVs as mediators of allergic diseaseImmune system recognition of pathogens is essential to acti- vating immune cells.

Further studies might elucidate interactions between the microbiota and the immune system that contribute to asthma.An effective immune response requires appropriate cytokines and other inflammatory mediators produced by infected or res- ident cells.

EVs might provide new insights into immune responses as they can move to distant sites and stimulate other cells such as immune and epithelial cells.
