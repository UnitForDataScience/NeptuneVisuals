As some of these bacterial species have been linked to dysplastic processes elsewhere in the tracts a causal link between the presence of such bacteria and pancreatic neoplasm may also exist and the results may indicate that bacterial colonization of pancre- atic cyst fluid is a regular phenomenon.MethodsPatient samples and pancreatic cyst fluid collectionA cohort of 69 patients with suspected cystic lesions was established between the period of 2008 and 2013 Table and Additional file pancreatic cyst fluids PCF were collected after a signed informed consent from these patients who were undergoing endoscopic ultra- sound fine needle aspiration EUS-FNA at the Depart- ment of Gastroenterology Erasmus MC The Netherlands.

The results were in accordance with the bacterial presence in thedifferent types of cysts based on the universal primer PCR sequencing.Microbial composition of pancreatic cyst fluid suggests the presence of a unique ecosystemA comparison of 13 different body sites Human Micro- biome Project with the PCF bacterial population showed 26 unique bacterial genotypes in PCF when compared with stool 27 genotypes compared with throat 28 genotypes compared with tongue dorsum and 36 unique bacterial genotypes in the PCF which are not present within any of the other body sites selected Fig.

and Additional file ANOVA analysis which is per- formed to identify the effect size of the bacterial popula- tion reveals that 314 bacterial microbiota show an effect size variation between the bacterial commensals in PCFversus selected body sites high effect size 0.1 to 0.9 and P  0.01 bacterial populations are shown in Fig.

Peppelenbosch12 and Sergey R. Konstantinov14BackgroundPancreatic cysts are fluid-filled neoplasms that can be detected with a frequency of up to 2 in the general asymptomatic adult population and have a low but not negligible risk for evolving into pancreatic ductal adeno- carcinoma while accounting for up to 5 of the total incidence of pancreatic cancerous lesions The vast majority of cysts are coincidentally found during cross- Correspondence 1Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam 's Gravendijkwal 230 3015 CE Rotterdam TheNetherlands4Janssen Vaccines and Prevention B.V.

Using UCHIME algorithm chimeric contigs were flagged and removed a known reference for chimeric sequence was cross referenced  These final set of contigs were then phylotype binned into operational taxonomic units OTU based on the Silva V.119 database and the abun- dance of each OTU in the population was estimated.Comparison of the taxonomic classification of the pancreatic microbiomes with those from other body sitesIn order to identify microbial signature of pancreatic cysts a comparative analysis was carried out against organ-specific bacterial profiles obtained from the NIH Human Microbiome Project HMP database The pancreatic microbial profile of the current study was compared with microbial profiles of 13 different body sites downloaded from HMP SRA numbers provided in Additional file The notion that bacteria in the gutmay affect diseases outside the gut and vice versa is gradually accepted and we therefore considered both anatomical sited in close proximity to the pancreas as well as more distant sites.The comparative analysis was carried out between anterior nares antecubital fossa buccal mucosa gin- giva hard palate mid vagina palatine tonsils poster- ior fornix retroauricular crease saliva stool throat and tongue.

The genus Helicobacter was only marginally detected in pancreatic cyst fluid other bacterial species linked to transformation in the intestine were however more prevalent.

Pancreatic cyst fluid DNA was diluted to 1 ngml for the PCR analyses and subsequently stored at - 20 degC.PCR analysesTotal DNA isolated from pancreatic cyst fluids was used for bacterial 16S rRNA gene detection using conven- tional PCR.

We concluded that this cohort would allow the study of potential microbiological constituents of PCF and to relate results to the clin- ical phenotype of the patient from which the fluid was obtained.Bacterial DNA is commonly present in EUS-FNA-collected pancreatic cyst fluidsAs it is as yet unknown whether pancreatic cystic fluid hosts a microbiological component analyzed the EUS- FNA-collected pancreatic cyst fluid obtained from our co- hort for the presence of significant amounts of bacterial DNA.

is not different between the different groups P value  0.99 one-way ANOVA.Diversity within the cyst type and resectionsThere were no significant difference in the diversity of bacterial microbiota seen in the 33 sample group of deep sequenced data between the cyst types or between the resected vs non resected groups or between the CA19.9 or CEA range-based classification groups.
