as some of these bacterial species have been linked to dysplastic processes elsewhere in the tracts a causal link between the presence of such bacteria and pancreatic neoplasm may also exist and the results may indicate that bacterial colonization of pancre- atic cyst fluid is a regular phenomenon.methodspatient samples and pancreatic cyst fluid collectiona cohort of 69 patients with suspected cystic lesions was established between the period of 2008 and 2013 table and additional file pancreatic cyst fluids pcf were collected after a signed informed consent from these patients who were undergoing endoscopic ultra- sound fine needle aspiration eus-fna at the depart- ment of gastroenterology erasmus mc the netherlands.

the results were in accordance with the bacterial presence in thedifferent types of cysts based on the universal primer pcr sequencing.microbial composition of pancreatic cyst fluid suggests the presence of a unique ecosystema comparison of 13 different body sites human micro- biome project with the pcf bacterial population showed 26 unique bacterial genotypes in pcf when compared with stool 27 genotypes compared with throat 28 genotypes compared with tongue dorsum and 36 unique bacterial genotypes in the pcf which are not present within any of the other body sites selected fig.

pancreatic cyst fluid dna was diluted to 1 ngml for the pcr analyses and subsequently stored at - 20 degc.pcr analysestotal dna isolated from pancreatic cyst fluids was used for bacterial 16s rrna gene detection using conven- tional pcr.

thus the most straightforward interpretation of results is that the pancreatic cyst is home to a previously unsuspected and also unique bacterial ecosystem.the presence of such a bacterial ecosystem in pancre- atic cysts raises important questions as to the role of the bacteria present in such cysts in the development of such structures.

at bay with the notion of a causative role for the bacterial flora in pancreatic cyst formation however is the observation that both detection of bacteria per se or the composition of the cyst flora did not show correl- ation to clinical parameters and thus the role of the flora in cystogenesis if any awaits further study.pancreatic infections mainly arise from translocation of bacteria from the small bowel and rarely from the colon and oropharyngeal route as demonstrated by studyon veillonella and bifidobacterium spp.

as such changes in the bacterial commu- nities may serve to detect such transformation in cyst- forming structures and may become useful for guiding clinical management.irrespective however of its potential as future diag- nostic and prognostic marker the present study shows an as yet unknown bacterial ecosystem in pancreatic cyst fluid.

if however the presence of pancreatic cyst can be linked to the microbiome this would entail a signifi- cant step forward with respect to our understanding of pancreatic cystogenesis.the above-mentioned considerations prompted us to explore the potential microbial component of pancreatic cyst fluid.

following collection pancreatic cyst fluids were trans- ferred to the laboratory and stored at - 150 degc until analysis.dna isolationapproximately 300 ml from 69 pancreatic cyst fluid samples were used for total dna isolation.

importantly we found that the majority of these fluid samples were rich for bacterial dna with 16s rrna pcr demonstrating the presence of bacterial dna in 64 92.8 out of the 69 samples table and fig.
