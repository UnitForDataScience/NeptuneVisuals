Although the physiological implications of changes in individual lipids were not within the scope of this published work the rich MS data set that was produced highlights the importance of examining behavior of individual lipids in studies of metabolism and transport.Complex Lipid Synthesis and Remodeling Occurs in the embryonic and Larval Zebrafish YolkThe embryonic and larval zebrafish yolk is metabolically active not just in lipid transport but also in the synthesis and remodeling of complex lipids as was demonstrated through the injection ofTabLe 2  The larval zebrafish is a versatile model system for metabolic labeling of lipids.so by the time its yolk supply is depleted it must be able to digest and absorb nutrients from exogenous food sources.

Taken together this and other evidence shows that the yolk is metabolically active throughout develop- ment and can both break down and synthesize complex lipids   .DieTaRY LiPiD UPTaKe iN THe LaRvaL ZebRaFiSHDigestion and absorption of Dietary Complex LipidsThe larval zebrafish undergoes a switch from a lecithotrophic state to a free-feeding animal during its fifth day of developmentthe precursor of eicosanoids a class of signaling molecules with roles in regulating inflammation vascular physiology and stem cell activity  .This finding suggests eicosanoids as an important area of interest in the ongoing characterization of yolk utilization in the zebrafish.

In mtp-- mutant zebrafish larvae lipids are trapped in the yolk characterized by retention of yolk volume an increase in yolk opacity and a reduction in neutral lipid in the body and larvae do not survive beyond 5 days .

It is likely that this portion of the cholesterol is directed to synthesis of steroid hormones and bile though these compounds were not measured in this study.Phospholipid dynamics in the developing embryo also appear to be more complex than simple yolk to body trafficking while other PL classes seem to move gradually from the yolk to the body phosphatidylcholine PC levels in the yolk increase over the first 24 h then decrease over the next 4 days while remaining relatively constant in the body .

It is possible that longer-chain PLs predominate in lipoproteins but are a minor species in cell membranes a model supported by a large increase in the amount of PC182204 in the yolk over the course of development this species is the only PL in the yolk whose total molar amount increases over 1-5 days though other PL species increase in the yolk in terms of percentage of total lipid.

When BODIPY-C12 was injected into the yolk of 24 hpf zebrafish embryos and yolk and body lipids were analyzed separately by TLC 1-6 h post injection hpi fluorescent complex lipids includ- ing TG CE and several unidentified species were produced in the yolk at early time points.

Genetic tractability and amenability to live imaging and a range of biochemical methods make the larval zebrafish an ideal model in which to address open questions in the field of lipid transport energy homeostasis and nutrient metabolism.Keywords lipid metabolism zebrafish lipoproteins comparative physiology enterocytesiNTRODUCTiONThe developing digestive system of the embryonic and larval zebrafish is a well-established model system for the study of vertebrate gastrointestinal physiology and metabolism.

The intestine of the larval zebrafish is open at both ends and ready to absorb exogenous food at 5 dpf though the non-enterocyte secretory cell populations do not differenti- ate until later larval stages .
