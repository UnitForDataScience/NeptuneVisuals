Identification of four infants with potential methicillin resistant S. aureus MRSA or S. epidermidis MRSE carriage along with high abundances and prevalence of both S. aureus and S. epidermidis species across the dataset could indicate a significant reservoir for AMR transfer between the species as well as highlight the seeding of the infant gut microbiome from an early stage.Focus on S. aureus species detectedNext we wanted to understand the relationship of the S. aureus species within the mecA positive as well as negative samples as the premature infants overlapped in time and so could harbour closely related strains.

Although we found no correlation between diversity and antibiotic exposure with infants treated with either no antibiotics including during pregnancy to up to 8 days of antibiotic administration effects such as relatively small sample size as well as day of life of sample and normal gut development are biases to this finding which is contrary to other studies within infants .

In total we identified a non-redundant set of 172 species across all samples see for complete dataset.Prevalence of antimicrobial resistanceBefore focusing on individual AMR genes we measured the a-diversity Shannon- Weaver index within each sample and although a small sample set compared this to3200400Depth of coverage bp1437AGlyBlaFos FlqMLSPheTetTmtSampleQ87 Q26 Q175 Q89 Q83 Q219 Q216 Q142 Q189 Q117 Q19the known antibiotic exposure of the preterm infants .

The cycling conditions were as follows 95 C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 98 C for 20 s 53 C for 30 s and 72 C for 30 s followed by a final extension of 72 C for 4 min.

Heavy use of antibiotics in the course of care of premature infants would not only then skew the bacterial population and drive resistance selection but has been shown to increase the activityof some transposable elements due to stressing of bacterial populations  .In this study we present a detailed investigation of the resistome from the GI microbiota of eleven premature infants with detailed information on antibiotic receipt and maternal antibiotic use.

Computational S. aureus sequence typing ST was also performed using SRST2  under default scoring parameters and using the S. aureus MLST schema downloaded on 18-04-16 from pubmlst.org.

However it is important to stress that the small and heterogeneous nature of the sample set will have reduced the power to detect differences between antibiotic exposure in this study and so prevented any meaningful stratification by other clinical variables such as mode of delivery or day of life.A mapping based approach against a comprehensive collection of acquired antibiotic resistance genes was next used to quantify AMR within the eleven metagenomes  .

Paired end PE sequencing was performed on the NextSeq using a v2 300 cycle high output reagent kit Illumina and on the MiSeq using the v3 600 cycle reagent kit Illumina.Prior to sequencing the complete dataset three libraries from three infant faecal samples were sequenced as part of separate multiplexed MiSeq runs generating a mean 8.3 million PE reads and 5.0 Gbp sequence yield per sample.

After library amplification the negative extraction control and one preterm infant faecal sample required 8 PCR cycles owing to very low starting pre-PCR biomass DNA concentration 0.1 ngul therefore these samples were excluded from downstream analysis leaving faecal samples from eleven premature infants.Shotgun metagenomic sequencingLibrary insert size and quantity was assessed for each sample by Bioanalyser and qPCR as described previously .

Eight of the eleven infants had received a course of prophylactic antibiotic treatment consisting of co-amoxiclav  whilst a second course was administered to four infants consisting of combinations of co-amoxiclav tazocin or vancomycin.
