Two papers in Cell exploit C. elegans to infer anticancer drug mechanisms.

elegans has great potential to serve as an informative experimentally acces- sible model system for studying drug metabolism in the host-microbiome holo- biont.

First C. elegans is arguably the best-char- acterized animal on Earth.

With a wide variety of genetic tools available including CRISPR-Cas9 C. elegans serves as an excellent tool for genetic study in a multicellular organism.

Furthermore C. elegans can be easily and inexpensively maintained in the labo- ratory.

elegans to enable the study of drug interactions with the host-microbiota hol- obiont.

Since colorectal cancer oc- curs at the interface with the gut micro- biota and because other drugs are known to be metabolized differently depending on the individual patient's microbiome investigating the contribution of the mi- crobiota to drug efficacy and activation for fluoropyrimidines is a promising avenue of exploration.5-FU and the other drugs screened in these papers impede C. elegans development and fertility.

Both studies employ similar screening systems that allow drug bacterial food source and C. elegans ge- notype to be manipulated.

Loss of upp inhibits RNA damage through ribonucleotide metabolism resulting in increased C. elegans resistance to 5-FU.tions.

Such precision and detail often eludes most microbiome studies which are clouded by an excess of variables and small sample sizes in more expensive systems.These studies show that C. elegans is a powerful tool for obtaining mecha- nistic insight into microbial processes and how they are impacted by drug metabolism.
