Beta diversity was significantly different between aged and young groups p  0.001 B.The relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae correlates with anxiety-like behaviour in aged miceBecause some of the microbiota changes observed have been associated with cognitive dysfunction we compared relative abun- dance of 3 taxa that were significantly altered in aged mice Por- phyromonadaceae Odoribacter and TM7 with behavioural data.

However whereas younger mice spent sig- nificantly more time interacting with a novel mouse than a familiar mouse p  0.0001 aged mice spent similar amount of time inves- tigating the novel and familiar mice suggesting an impairment in social recognition or a reduced preference for social novelty B.Aged mice exhibit increased basal gut permeability which is further exacerbated by acute stress exposureGut permeability was assessed in young and aged mice prior to and following 1 h of restraint stress.

Interestingly only significant increases in bacterial taxa were seen in aged mice compared to young .At phylum level the most prevalent microbial taxa in both sam- ple groups were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes accounting for a combined relative abundance of 95 in the young and aged sam- ples .

Together these highly abundant genera account for approximately 50 relative abundance at the genus level in both aged and young mice.Several statistically significant changes in bacterial groups were observed in aged mice .

Interestingly acute restraint stress exacerbated gut permeability in aged animals despite a lack of rise in plasma glucocorticoid levels in our studies aged mice actually had a blunted and slower HPA axis response to acute stress although it appears that they may also experience prolonged corticosterone release.

To this end we assessed the behavioural physiological and caecal microbiota profile of aged male mice.

Furthermore stress exacerbated the gut permeability of aged mice.

Examination of the caecal microbiota revealed significant increases in phylum TM7 family Porphyromonadaceae and genus Odoribacter of aged mice.
