Among these P. pentosaceus I147 whose fermentation caused a marked decrease in condensed tannins concentration and P. pentosaceus I56 also characterized by high b-glucosidase by the ability to increase the antioxidant activity and to decreasecondensed tannins and phytic acid during fermentation of faba bean dough.The cluster III grouped EPS-producing strains belonging to Weissella genus with moderate or low phytase and b-glucosidase activities and poor ability to degrade condensed tannins and raffinose.Cluster IV grouped strains characterized by moderate proteolytic activity release of TFAA.

None of the strains showed antimicrobial activity toward Staphylococcus aureus while eight strains of P. pentosaceus exhibited a strong inhibitory activity toward Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes.

lactis F55 W. cibaria F110 and W. koreensis F11 and F113.No antimicrobial activity was found toward S. aureus DSM20231 while eight strains P. pentosaceus I02 I014 I76 I147 F01 W. koreensis I19 F113 and E. casseliflavus exhibited a strong inhibitory activity toward E. coli DSM30083 .Faba Bean Flour Fermentation Proteolysis Antioxidant Activity and Degradation of Phytic Acid Raffinose and Condensed TanninsAll the 27 strains were singly used to ferment faba bean doughs.
