among these p. pentosaceus i147 whose fermentation caused a marked decrease in condensed tannins concentration and p. pentosaceus i56 also characterized by high b-glucosidase by the ability to increase the antioxidant activity and to decreasecondensed tannins and phytic acid during fermentation of faba bean dough.the cluster iii grouped eps-producing strains belonging to weissella genus with moderate or low phytase and b-glucosidase activities and poor ability to degrade condensed tannins and raffinose.cluster iv grouped strains characterized by moderate proteolytic activity release of tfaa.

none of the strains showed antimicrobial activity toward staphylococcus aureus while eight strains of p. pentosaceus exhibited a strong inhibitory activity toward escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes.

antioxidant antimicrobial and probiotic activities as well as the capacity to decrease the content of anfs have been extensively exploited in food fermentation  .the aim of this research was to establish the main metabolic traits and the enzymatic activities of different lab strains related to potential functional applications of fermented faba bean for further selection and use as starters in the food industry.materials and methodsmicroorganismstwenty-seven lab strains previously isolated from italian and finnish faba bean sourdoughs were employed in this study   .

the cluster ii grouped eight of the nine p. pentosaceus strains investigated and other two strains belonging to other species.
