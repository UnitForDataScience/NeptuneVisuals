Compared with the CON pigs pigs sup- plemented with 1.0 and 2.0 mgkg MccJ25 had sharply increased ADG P  0.007 and P  0.039 respectively and marginally improved GF P  0.060 and P  0.054 respectively and decreased diarrhea incidence P  0.04 and P  0.026 respectively.

Table 4 On d 28 d the serum concentrations of d-lactate linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.003 DAO linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.045 and en- dotoxins linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.004 were sharply decreased with increasing MccJ25 sup- plementation in pigs Table 4.

The pigs fed 2.0 mgkg MccJ25 had greater ATTD of OM P  0.014 and GEP  0.001 than pigs fed ABD whereas there was no significant difference in ATTD of CP between pigs fed2.0 mgkg MccJ25 and pigs fed ABD Table 3.The Concentrations of dLactate Diamine Oxidase and EndotoxinsOn d 14 pigs had sharply decreased linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.001 levels of DAO and d-lactate and decreased concentrations of endotoxins linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.010 in serum with increasing MccJ25 supplementation Table 4.

Additionally remarkable differences in ADFI among all treatments were not evident Table 2.During d 0 to 14 the ADG linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.001 ADFI linear P  0.008 and GF linear P  0.012 of pigs were significantly improved with increasing MccJ25 supplementation.

Compared with the CON pigs the pigs fed MccJ25 and ABD had sharply improved ADG P  0.001 ADFI P  0.009 and GF P  0.019 and decreased P  0.021 diarrhea incidence.

There was no significant difference in growth performance and diarrhea incidence between pigs fed MccJ25 and pigs fed the ABD Table 2.Apparent Total Tract Digestibility of NutrientsThe ATTD of OM linear P  0.001 CP linear P  0.001 and GE linear P  0.001 and quadratic P  0.006 was significantly increased in response to increasing MccJ25 supplementation Table 3.

The pigs fed diets containing 1.0 and 2.0 mgkg MccJ25 did not have in- creased concentrations of d-lactate P  0.013 and P  0.001 respectively and DAO P  0.004 and P  0.001 respectively compared with the pigs fed the ABD diet.

Compared with pigs fed the ABD pigs fed diets containing 1.0 and 2.0 mgkg MccJ25 had remarkably decreased serum d-lactate P  0.029 and P  0.007 respectively and DAO P 0.011 and P  0.006 respectively concentrations.However the concentration of serum endotoxins was5070Left running head Yu et al.similar between pigs fed MccJ25 and pigs fed the ABD Table 4.Cytokine Levels in SerumThe cytokine concentrations in serum are pre- sented in Fig.

Pigs fed 1.0 and 2.0 mgkg MccJ25 had greater fecal Lactobacillus counts P  0.001 and lower fecal E. coli counts P  0.001 than pigs fed ABD but Bifidobacterium counts remained the same in pigs fed ABD and MccJ25.On d 28 pigs fed MccJ25 and ABD had lower E. coli numbers P  0.002 and greater Lactobacillus numbers P  0.001 in feces than the CON pigs Fig.

Data are presented as mean values with their SE P  0.05 was considered statistically sig- nificant and P  0.10 indicated a trend.RESULTSGrowth Performance and Diarrhea IncidenceOn d 28 pigs fed diets supplemented with MccJ25 had significantly increased ADG linear P  0.003 with increasing MccJ25 supplementation Table 2.
