and other partially acid-fast bacteria that have the potential to cause antigenic persistency have also been investigated with pcr in cases of sgpd but have not yielded positive results.56molecular studies using sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna gene and fungal its region which is present in all bacteria and fungi respectively revealed that the skin surface is inhabited by a highly diverse and variable microbiome that had not been previously demonstrated using culture-based methods.9101314 other studies have further demonstrated that the skin micro- biome extends beyond the surface the dermis and subcuta- neous tissues once considered to be sterile environments have been shown to have bacterial dna although whether this dna is from living or active bacteria is still unknown.21 a few studies have used next-generation sequencing ngs to describe the canine and feline skin microbiome and to investigate its possible role in skin diseases.318192324 through the characterization of these highly complex microbial communities these studies revealed differences in the bacterial and fungal microbiota between healthy and allergic skin and demonstrated the importance of ngs to describe a possible correlation between the microbiome and cutaneous allergies.the development of ngs which is capable of identifying very small amounts of bacterial or fungal dna brings a new opportunity to investigate if an infectious agent could be asso- ciated with the development of inflammatory skin lesions in canine sgpd.

this study provides additional evidence that sgpd lesions are likely sterile.keywordscanine skin sterile pyogranulomatous granulomatous dermatitis sterile granuloma and pyogranuloma syndromesterile granulomatous and pyogranulomatous dermatitis sgpd are skin lesions uncommonly seen in dogs and rarely seen in cats.

however significant differ- ences between the samples of the different groups were only found for organisms commonly identified on skin surfaces of dogs and no significant differences in abundance of known invasive or novel pathogens were identified in skin lesions of sgpd.

are the most common bacteria isolated from canine hair and hair follicles.11 bacteria of the family erysipelotricha- ceae members of the phylum firmicutes are commoninhabitants of the skin and mucosal surfaces of healthy dogs24 and are commonly found in the canine fecal microbiota.30 thus the bacteria more abundant in sgpd samples are com- mon inhabitants on the skin of dogs.

despite our efforts to reduce contamination numerous microbial sequences identified in the control and sgpd skin samples could have come from these sources.this study revealed that the bacteria erysipelotrichaceae staphylococcus and corynebacterium found to be more abun- dant in sgpd samples are common inhabitants of the skin surface and unlikely to be the underlying infectious agents of sgpd.

nevertheless this is the first study utiliz- ing next-generation sequencing to identify potential bacterialand fungal pathogens in the skin and additional studies should be developed utilizing molecular techniques targeting specific pathogens to confirm these findings and to rule out other pathogens not evaluated in this study.acknowledgementsthe authors would like to acknowledge the dermatologists general practitioners and pathologists who contributed to this research study by submitting skin specimens.declaration of conflicting intereststhe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research authorship andor publication of this article.fundingfabio b. rosa's visitor scholar fellowship was supported by the coordination for the improvement of higher education personnel capes-brazil project no.

skin microbiome genomics-based insights into the diversity and role of skin microbes.

551 124-132a the authors 2017 reprints and permission abstractnext generation sequencing ngs studies are revealing a diverse microbiota on the skin of dogs.

the skin microbiota of canine sterile granulomatous and pyogranulomatous dermatitis sgpd has yet to be investigated using ngs techniques.

ngs targeting the 16s rrna and its-1 region of bacterial and fungal dna respectively were used to investigate if bacterial and fungal dna were associated with skin lesions in cases of canine sgpd.

the study included 20 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ffpe skin samples and 12 fresh samples from sgpd-affected dogs and 10 ffpe and 10 fresh samples from healthy dogs.

the bacteria found to be more abundant in sgpd are common inhabitants of skin surfaces and likely secondary contaminants in sgpd cases.

the etiology is unknown but a possible cause is immune dysfunction associated with antigenic sti- mulation as sgpd lesions often respond to immunosup-infections and with certain fungal infections bacterial and fungal culture and special stains are often negative suggest- ing these lesions are not associated with an infectious cause and so considered to be sterile.26pressive therapy.31 furthermore it has been speculated that these lesions could be the result of low abundance ofinfectious organisms or the incomplete clearing of antigens associated with infectious organisms.51226 clinically sgpd lesions are characterized by multifocal nodules mostly affecting haired skin which occasionally become ulcerated and histologically by a large infiltration of macrophages with or without multinucleated giant cells and neutrophils with a multifocal to coalescing nodular pattern that extends from the dermis to the panniculus.1226 a com- plete work up to rule out infectious agents including bac- teria and fungi must be performed before starting treatment with steroids.12262731 although the histological presenta- tion is similar to lesions seen in cases of mycobacterial1department of veterinary pathobiology college of veterinary medicine andbiomedical sciences texas am university college station tx usa 2department of small animal clinical sciences college of veterinary medicine and biomedical sciences texas am university college station tx usa 3texas am veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories college station tx usafabio brum rosa and caitlin e. older contributed equally for this work.

the objectives of this study were to investi- gate if a potential underlying bacterial andor fungal infection or dna fragments of these organisms were associated with development of skin lesions in cases of canine sgpd.
