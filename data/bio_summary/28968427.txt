The presence of environmental bacteria in meconium could be caused by a possible contamination at the time of sample collection.Maternal impact on the bacterial colonization processOur study shows that each infant's bacterial microbiota is significantly closer to that of the mother than to that of any other woman in the mothers' group suggesting that the mother is actively involved in the initial seeding of her child's gut bacterial microbiota.

Other studie  did not find any effect of the delivery mode on the gut bacterial microbiota and suggested that the composition of the early infant gut bacterial microbiota is only associated with the maternal diet during the last three months of pregnancy.Establishment of the anaerobic bacterial floraIn D28 samples the gut flora was composed almost exclusively of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

This could also explain the larger diversity observed in the meconium bacterial microbiota compo- sition because the bacteria present in utero can be quite different between mothers.The bacterial microbiota richness of the fecal samples D02 to D28 is lower than that of the mothers' samples.

To study the influence of country delivery mode and feeding method on the bacterial microbiota bacterial genera were investi- gated using linear mixed models with a random term corresponding to the child.

maternal or formula.Effect of the delivery mode on bacterial communitiesOur findings indicate that the Bacteroides and Collinsella genera are more abundant in the fecal bacterial microbiota of children born naturally while the Sarcina and Klebsiella genera are predominant in children born by C-section.

By comparing the bacterial diversity of meconium and adult fecal samples Hu et al.

Based on this previous finding and on their result that the dominant bacterial genera in the meconium are different from those found in the fecal skin or vaginal environments of pregnant women Gosalbes et al.

Along the same lines a recent review by Rutayisire et al.showed that the delivery mode affects the diversity and colonization pattern of the gut bacterial microbiota during the first three months of life.

To study the establishment of the gut bacterial community bacterial genera were considered.

To study the association between viral and bacterial presence in the samples mixed linear models were fitted with the loga- rithm-transformed frequencies for each bacterial genus as response and the presenceabsence of a virus as explaining variable.
