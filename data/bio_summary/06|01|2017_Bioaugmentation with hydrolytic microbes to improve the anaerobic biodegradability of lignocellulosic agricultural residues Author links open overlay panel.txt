Regarding CSTRB six samples were obtained 1 before the first bioaugmentation period B1 2 after the end of the first bioaugmentation period at 53rd day B2 3 two HRTs after the first bioaugmentation period B3 4 before the second bioaug- mentation and at steady-state conditions under the increased OLR B4 5 after the second bioaugmentation period at the 121th day B5 and 6 two HRTs after the second bioaugmentation period B6.

Regarding the CSTRC five samples were taken 1 before the first bioaugmentation period C1 2 after the first bioaugmentation period C2 3 two HRTs after the first bioaug- mentation period C3 4 after the second bioaugmentation period C4 and 5 two HRTs after the second bioaugmentation period C5.

During the whole experimental period pH VFA and biogas composition were measured twice a week.The reactors' performance was monitored for a period of 145 days separated into distinctly different phases to evaluate the effect of bioaugmentation under different reactor operational conditions.

In the meantime the share of wheat straw in the feedstock was increased to 15 on VS basis to evaluate whether the effect of the examined strain can be shown more pronounced using a greater accumulated amount of recalcitrant biomass.After the change of feedstock composition and under steady state conditions the methane yield differed insignificantly 242 - 13 mLCH4gVS compared to the previous untreated period p  0.05 and on day 115 the second bioaugmentation period was initiated.

A similar increase was recorded in CSTR during the bioaugmentation period however at steady-state the effect was notice- ably lower 7.5.

Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans were not detected in increased relative abundance at the end of the experimental period.

The main physicochemical characteristics of the effluent after starvation period were pH 8.11 Total Solids TS 27.47 - 0.24 gL Volatile Solids VS17.11 - 0.12 gL Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen TKN 3.63 - 0.13 g-NLAmmonium Nitrogen 3.51 - 0.12 g NHth4 -NL and total Volatile Fatty Acids TVFA 0.90 - 0.10 gL.Manure and wheat strawCattle manure was obtained from a livestock farm in Snertinge Zealand Denmark.

A mixture of cattle manure and wheat straw was used as feedstock for an initial period of 45 days.

The bioaugmentation period lasted six days days 46- 51.

During the bioaugmentation period 100 mL of pure culture replaced daily the equal amount of reactor's working volume.
