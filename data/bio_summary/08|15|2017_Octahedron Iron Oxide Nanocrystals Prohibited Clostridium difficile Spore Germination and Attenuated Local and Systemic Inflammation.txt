In an in vivo C. difficile infection mouse experiment we found that Fe3-dO4 significantly reduced the inflammation indices in the groups treated with spores Fe3-dO4 and that it effectively inhibited C. difficile spore germination thus controlling in vivo the virulence of C. difficile.

The spores of C. difficile are the major cause of C. difficile infection.

The germination of C. difficile CCUG 19126 spores and of C. difficile BAA-1805 spores was not significantly differentFigure 3.

In a C. difficile infection animal model the inflammatory level triple decreased in mice with colonic C. difficile spores treated with Fe3-dO4 nanoparticles.Histopathological analysis showed a decreased intense neutrophil accumulation in the colon tissue of the Fe3-dO4 nanoparticle-treated mice.

Therefore we quantitatively assessed C. difficile infection by directly injecting mice with spores which is most relevant to the pathogenesis of clinical C. difficile infection.

Fe3-dO4 nanoparticle treatment not only inhibited the germination of different clinical strains of C. difficile spores in vitro but also reduced the virulence of spores that induced C. difficile infection in vivo.

The virulence of C. difficile depends upon the gene expression of tcdA-encoded toxin A an enterotoxin and tcdB-encoded toxin B a cytotoxin.
