Studies into the ability of plant viruses to replicate in the human gut in epithelial and microbial cells should be initiated.4445The low numbers of phage sequences retrieved corresponding to Haemophilus influenza phage HP2 Roseophage SIO1 phage L cro and Shigella flexneri phage V44 and enterobacteria phage phiK and phage phiV1045 reflected earlier findings43 in relation to the low numbers of RNA phages recovered from human faeces.

A potential pathogenic mechanism involves translocation of viruses present in the gut microbiota across the intestinal epithelial barrier particularly in situa- tions of altered and increased permeability that exert immunomodu- latory effects on the host.51HIV-1 and rotavirus are known to escape the gut and dissemi- nate to peripheral tissues via components of the immune sys- tem.51 Enterocytes are able to recognise specific phage peptides and transport them across the mucosal barrier.51 HIV patients are affected by translocation and have associated systemic inflamma- tion.52 Changes to the faecal virome and bacterial microbiome have been seen in HIV patients with increased numbers of aden- ovirus-associated sequences and increased bacterial diversity and richness associated with peripheral CD4 T-cell counts of 200 phage populations are not detectably affected by HIV disease sta- tus or anti-retroviral therapies52 but plasma samples from HIV patients contain gut microbiota-derived nucleic acids.53 Phages have been detected in blood samples of healthy humans while mycobacteriophages have been found in the blood of patients with sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease CD and in healthy individu- als.5154 Circulating phages have also been detected in blood sam- ples after oral administration of antibiotics to patients with bacterial infections whereas no phages could be detected in their blood prior to antibiotic therapy.51 It is not known if these phages were of GI origin.

Of the 597 human faecal samples exam- ined 76.5 had fewer than 10 pfumL sample and 14.6 had between 10 and 100 pfumL sample 20 wv faecal homoge- nates.Metagenomics was used to examine RNA viral assemblages in faecal samples obtained from two healthy adults two samples were collected from one donor 6 months apart with one sample obtained from the other donor.44 Three shotgun viral cDNA libraries were generated with a total of 36769 viral sequences obtained 91.5 of these had significant similarity to sequences in the GenBank data- base with three-quarters being most similar to viruses.

Combining virus isolation and metagenomicsThose studies targeting only the VLPs of the microbiota will not capture prophage diversity within samples and will contain little information to allow studies of phage-host interactions or host ranges limiting in-depth analyses of the overall ecology of the gut microbiome.21 Studying total community metagenomes in conjunc- tion with VLP-derived metagenomes will provide a more-complete picture of virus-host interactions in the human gut.21 The greatest challenge to integrated studies of the whole gut microbiome isTABL E 3 Available tools for analysis of viruses in total community and viral metagenomesPHACCS89Assesses the biodiversity of viromes requires knowledge of virus genome sizes desktop apphttpssourceforge.netprojectsphaccsMetaVir 29192Annotates viral metagenomes raw reads or assembled contigs web-basedVanator94Perl pipeline using a number of alignment assembly and analysis tools to assess metagenomic data derived from Illumina data virus discovery desktop apphttpssourceforge.netprojectsvanator-cvrViromeScan96Characterises taxonomy of eukaryotic viruses directly from raw reads desktop apphttpssourceforge.netprojectsviromescanVirusDetect98Analyses small RNA datasets for known and novel viruses web-based and desktop appVirusSeeker100BLAST-based sequence analysis pipeline for eukaryotic and prokaryotic virus discovery and virome composition desktop apphttpswupathlabs.wustl.eduvirusseekerVirFinder73k-mer frequency-based machine-learning method for virus contig identification in total community metagenomesthe lack of available phage sequences from isolated viruses Fig- ure 2.

Isolation-kit contaminantsFew studies of the human virome have considered the effects of contaminants in reagents and nucleic acid extraction kits on viral metagenomes Table S1 though these are being increasingly recog- nised in prokaryote-focused studies.266970 Nucleases proteases and polymerases used in studies are produced in protein expression sys- tems and sequences associated with these expression vectors have been detected in virome studies.70 Columns used to purify DNAmay introduce parvovirus-like circovirusesdensoviruses and iri- doviruses sequences into samples and it has been suggested their use should be avoided in virome studies.2670 Efforts should be made to prevent cross-contamination of samples when processing samples for nucleic acid extraction and sequencing.2670 Low-biomass samples obtained from non-GI sites will be reliant on PCR-based approaches for the foreseeable future and these are most likely to be affected by contaminants in reagents.

A link to human inflammatory bowel dis- ease IBD is the observation that patients carrying mutations in both TLR3 and TLR7 had higher rates of hospitalisation compared with IBD patients without mutations.61810   THE INTESTINAL VIROME IN HUMAN IBDA link between the gut virome and CD was first suggested when it was found CD patients n  19 had significantly more VLPs phages in colonic biopsies than healthy individuals n  10 2.9 9 109 vs1.2 9 108 VLPsbiopsy and for the CD patients ulcerated mucosa had significantly fewer VLPs than nonulcerated mucosa 2.1 9 109 vs 4.1 9 109 VLPsbiopsy.9 More recent small-scale studies have been undertaken to characterise the gut virome of IBD.2962-64 A pilot metagenomic study of ileal and colonic contents of six CD patients and ileal samples from six non-IBD controls showed CD DNA-based viromes had higher phage abundance than control sam- ples.62 However the ways in which virome data from healthy con- trols n  8 and patients with ileocolic CD n  11 were analysed were found to contribute to interpretation of results.63 Prophages represented the most hits in the CD samples when unassembled reads were compared but were higher in the control group when the assembled data were compared.

Sequences associated with this phage were not found in American gut-associated datasets metagenome or virome suggesting geo- graphical variation in distribution of gut-associated phages.7 Using a similar metagenomic mining approach but with major capsid protein VP1 specific for the ssDNA phage family Microviridae members of the subfamilies Gokushovirinae Alpnavirinae and Pichovirinae were detected in faecal metagenomes.24By using phage genome signature-based recovery with meta- genomes several predominantly temperate potential gut-specific phages infecting members of the order Bacteroidales were identi- fied.21 This alignment-free approach was able to resolve phage sequences not readily detected by conventional alignment-driven approaches.

Between 4 and 22 of DNA in total community metagenomes can be derived from VLPs.20-22 This allows potential recovery of phage sequences not well represented in virome studies though still excludes RNA viruses from detailed analyses.Human gut-specific Bacteroides phage phB124-14 was isolated from municipal waters and infects Bacteroides fragilis GB-124 and a limited range of other B. fragilis strains.723 Sequences with homology to this phage were found in faecal metagenomes from MetaHIT 104124 and Japan 313 and human gut viromes 216.

Because most nucleotide sequences obtained from viral metagenomes are novel BLASTN analyses are generally uninfor- mative.71 It has been stated that isolating just a few phage gen- omes from novel environments will greatly increase our understanding of viral diversity in these environments.72 Recently OligoNucleotide Frequency profiling in conjunction with abun- dance profiling and homology methods has been proposed as a means of improving identification of microbial hosts for novel viruses from total community metagenomes7374 deriving full ben- efit from this approach relies on classical isolation and genomic characterisation of viruses and their hosts from environmental samples.
