combining virus isolation and metagenomicsthose studies targeting only the vlps of the microbiota will not capture prophage diversity within samples and will contain little information to allow studies of phage-host interactions or host ranges limiting in-depth analyses of the overall ecology of the gut microbiome.21 studying total community metagenomes in conjunc- tion with vlp-derived metagenomes will provide a more-complete picture of virus-host interactions in the human gut.21 the greatest challenge to integrated studies of the whole gut microbiome istabl e 3 available tools for analysis of viruses in total community and viral metagenomesphaccs89assesses the biodiversity of viromes requires knowledge of virus genome sizes desktop apphttpssourceforge.netprojectsphaccsmetavir 29192annotates viral metagenomes raw reads or assembled contigs web-basedvanator94perl pipeline using a number of alignment assembly and analysis tools to assess metagenomic data derived from illumina data virus discovery desktop apphttpssourceforge.netprojectsvanator-cvrviromescan96characterises taxonomy of eukaryotic viruses directly from raw reads desktop apphttpssourceforge.netprojectsviromescanvirusdetect98analyses small rna datasets for known and novel viruses web-based and desktop appvirusseeker100blast-based sequence analysis pipeline for eukaryotic and prokaryotic virus discovery and virome composition desktop apphttpswupathlabs.wustl.eduvirusseekervirfinder73k-mer frequency-based machine-learning method for virus contig identification in total community metagenomesthe lack of available phage sequences from isolated viruses fig- ure 2. because most nucleotide sequences obtained from viral metagenomes are novel blastn analyses are generally uninfor- mative.71 it has been stated that isolating just a few phage gen- omes from novel environments will greatly increase our understanding of viral diversity in these environments.72 recently oligonucleotide frequency profiling in conjunction with abun- dance profiling and homology methods has been proposed as a means of improving identification of microbial hosts for novel viruses from total community metagenomes7374 deriving full ben- efit from this approach relies on classical isolation and genomic characterisation of viruses and their hosts from environmental samples.

this suggested the most abundant phage groups in a given environment reflect the kinds of microbes found in that environment.1tabl e 1 phages recently isolated from the human gut microbiotaaphage isolated from same sample as host strain.5  mining total community metagenomes to reveal virus diversity with the exceptions of the proteobacteria mycobacteria and some lactic acid bacteria very few phages infecting prokaryotes have been isolated and sequenced figure 2. between 4 and 22 of dna in total community metagenomes can be derived from vlps.20-22 this allows potential recovery of phage sequences not well represented in virome studies though still excludes rna viruses from detailed analyses.human gut-specific bacteroides phage phb124-14 was isolated from municipal waters and infects bacteroides fragilis gb-124 and a limited range of other b. fragilis strains.723 sequences with homology to this phage were found in faecal metagenomes from metahit 104124 and japan 313 and human gut viromes 216. sequences associated with this phage were not found in american gut-associated datasets metagenome or virome suggesting geo- graphical variation in distribution of gut-associated phages.7 using a similar metagenomic mining approach but with major capsid protein vp1 specific for the ssdna phage family microviridae members of the subfamilies gokushovirinae alpnavirinae and pichovirinae were detected in faecal metagenomes.24by using phage genome signature-based recovery with meta- genomes several predominantly temperate potential gut-specific phages infecting members of the order bacteroidales were identi- fied.21 this alignment-free approach was able to resolve phage sequences not readily detected by conventional alignment-driven approaches.

studies into the ability of plant viruses to replicate in the human gut in epithelial and microbial cells should be initiated.4445the low numbers of phage sequences retrieved corresponding to haemophilus influenza phage hp2 roseophage sio1 phage l cro and shigella flexneri phage v44 and enterobacteria phage phik and phage phiv1045 reflected earlier findings43 in relation to the low numbers of rna phages recovered from human faeces.

of the 597 human faecal samples exam- ined 76.5 had fewer than 10 pfuml sample and 14.6 had between 10 and 100 pfuml sample 20 wv faecal homoge- nates.metagenomics was used to examine rna viral assemblages in faecal samples obtained from two healthy adults two samples were collected from one donor 6 months apart with one sample obtained from the other donor.44 three shotgun viral cdna libraries were generated with a total of 36769 viral sequences obtained 91.5 of these had significant similarity to sequences in the genbank data- base with three-quarters being most similar to viruses.

with respect to antibiotic-resis- tance genes their presence may have been over-estimated in human viromes112027313537 as these entities are thought to be rarely encoded in phages.39 consequently care should be taken when ana- lysing data proper in silico checks with conservative cut-offs arerequired to refine functional assignments and avoid over-interpreta- tion of data.39 induction of prophages encoded in prokaryote gen- omes during antibiotic treatment appears to be more relevant to gut microbial ecology--with an increased level of generalised transduc- tion and low level of transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes.39 ss dna viruses in the intestinal virome to date only one study has specifically examined the contribution of ssdna viruses to the human faecal virome.11 microviridae were found to represent the majority 27-49 of known phage sequences in samples from five healthy south koreans.

201746800-815.1  the human virome viruses are thought to be the most abundant and diverse entities on earth numbering as many as 1031 virus-like particles vlps1 though this paradigm is likely to change in light of information from large-scale sequencing surveys of marine environments and improved analytical tools.2 with the advent of new sequence-based technologies that do not rely on the ability to isolate viruses for their identification it is now possible to define and characterise viruses in different environmental samples in greater detail than ever before which has resulted in an increased interest in the role the viral assemblage of the human gut microbiota plays in health and disease.

it is likely gut-associated phages have very narrow host ranges.7study of viruses in clinical settings will be facilitated by methods such as the virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses vircapseq-vert a system that uses 2 million probes tar- geting the genomes of 207 viruses known to infect humans and other vertebrates to capture viral nucleic acids present in blood and tissue homogenates.134  metagenomics and the human intestinal virome the only reliable molecular method currently available for routine surveys of the human virome is metagenomics.

it is also important to remember in exploratory and other studies that detecting virus nucleic acids in samples gives no indication of whether the viruses infect human or other cells.26 individual intestinal viromes are unique but some phages are shared among individuals a longitudinal study three time points over 1 year of four pairs of adult monozygotic twins and their mothers demonstrated that while the faecal prokaryote communities of related individuals are very similar each individual harbours a unique faecal virome.27 intraper- sonal diversity of the virome was low with 95 of viruses retained over a 1-year period with a few temperate phages dominating the viromes.

manrique et al28 found the hgp was perturbed inthe uc n  66 and cd n  36 viromes of norman et al29 healthy subjects harboured on average 62 of the 23 core phages while this number was significantly reduced 37 and 30 respectively in uc and cd patients.examination of rna viruses present in colonic tissue from 10 ibd 6 cd 4 uc and five healthy individuals demonstrated ibd patients carried more mammalian viruses and human pathogens than healthy individuals adenoviridiae were present in the ibd samples but absent from the healthy controls.64 herv human endogenous retroviruses were found in the ibd viromes expression of herv proteins has been linked with inflammatory conditions.

the intestinal virome immune response and disease alterations in the intestinal virome characterised by reduced diver- sity and altered intestinal barrier function have been associated with infectious and autoimmune diseases in addition to metabolic disor- ders and cardiovascular disease figure 1. a potential pathogenic mechanism involves translocation of viruses present in the gut microbiota across the intestinal epithelial barrier particularly in situa- tions of altered and increased permeability that exert immunomodu- latory effects on the host.51hiv-1 and rotavirus are known to escape the gut and dissemi- nate to peripheral tissues via components of the immune sys- tem.51 enterocytes are able to recognise specific phage peptides and transport them across the mucosal barrier.51 hiv patients are affected by translocation and have associated systemic inflamma- tion.52 changes to the faecal virome and bacterial microbiome have been seen in hiv patients with increased numbers of aden- ovirus-associated sequences and increased bacterial diversity and richness associated with peripheral cd4 t-cell counts of 200 phage populations are not detectably affected by hiv disease sta- tus or anti-retroviral therapies52 but plasma samples from hiv patients contain gut microbiota-derived nucleic acids.53 phages have been detected in blood samples of healthy humans while mycobacteriophages have been found in the blood of patients with sarcoidosis and crohn's disease cd and in healthy individu- als.5154 circulating phages have also been detected in blood sam- ples after oral administration of antibiotics to patients with bacterial infections whereas no phages could be detected in their blood prior to antibiotic therapy.51 it is not known if these phages were of gi origin.

phaccs phage communities from contig spectrum-predicted median species richness of the samples was 44 range 19-785 in agreement with reyes et al27 median of 35 range 10-984. tailed phages predominated siphoviridae 18 of the total myoviridae 10 podoviridae 4.8 microviridae 0.9 other families 0.4. the majority of contigs 55 shared no significant amino acid homology with any phage family while 11 had homology to multiple phage families.

therefore there is a need to sample a wide range of body fluids and tissues from individuals globally to better under- stand the role of viruses in human health and disease.75 propaga- tion and characterisation of prokaryote- and eukaryote-infecting viruses will require huge efforts to fully characterise extant viral populations and there is still a wealth of viral diversity pathogenic and nonpathogenic to be discovered within human viromes.

influence of environmental factors on development of the infant virome differences in birth mode caesarean vs vaginal delivery and diet breast- vs formula-feeding age at which weaning began were con- founders in the study of lim et al.46 differences in the faecal micro- biota of breast- and formula-fed infants are well documented as are the effects of weaning.47 it is also known that 16s rrna gene- based sequencing studies do not always give accurate representa- tion of bifidobacterium populations in the infant faecal micro- biota.4849 therefore shotgun metagenome studies examining the infant microbiome and virome are required in carefully controlled populations to study the acquisition and development of the infant gi virome.the influence of malnutrition on development of the infant fae- cal virome was investigated during the first 30 months of life in eight pairs of healthy twins and 12 pairs of twins discordant for sev- ere acute malnutrition six pairs with one twin healthy one with marasmus six pairs with one twin healthy one with kwashiorkor.50 as with the study of lim et al46 anelloviridae were prevalent in early life but diminished at 15-18 months of age.

the protective effects of the virome may explain recent findings with respect to treatment of patients with clostridium diffi- cile infections with sterile faecal filtrates based on the published protocol the faecal filtrates used in the study are likely to have contained phages in addition to the bacterial debris proteins antimicrobial compounds metabolic products and oligonucleotides dna reported.58 support for a role for phages in the success of faecal microbial transplants fmts to treat c. difficile infections comes from a pilot study by zuo et al59 when donors had higher diversity richness of caudovirales than recipients fmt was suc- cessful in instances where recipient virome richness was greater than that of the donor over half of the recipients experienced dis- ease recurrence after fmt.
