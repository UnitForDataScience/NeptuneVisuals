The rationale for T3 therapy is T3 is biologically active hormone that does not require activity of the DIO2 which is needed for conversion from endogenous prohormone T4 to active T3 hormone or when exogenous levothyroxine LT4 monotherapy is administered.

Combination therapy with synthetic T3 and LT4 thyroid hormones T3 12.5-35 ug and LT4 50-75 ug was prescribed to four patients and one patient received biological thyroid hormone extract LT4  T3.

The treatment was based on careful interview clinical monitoring and laboratory analysis of serum free T3 FT3 reverse T3 rT3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone free T4 cortisol and dehy- droepiandrosterone DHEA values.

T3 or to an inhibitory reversed T3 form rT3 DIO3 -.

Exposure to volatile organic compounds present in water-damaged buildings including metabolic products of toxigenic fungi and mold-derived inflammatory agents can lead to a deficiency or imbalance of many hormones such as active T3 hormone.

It has been presumed that the peripheral conversion of T4 353'5'-tetraiodothyronine into T3 353'-triiodothyronine is sufficient to satisfy the overall tissue requirements.

The importance of avoiding mycotoxin exposure via the diet is underlined as DIO2 genetic polymorphism and dysfunction of DIO2 play an important role in the development of symptoms that can be treated successfully with T3 therapy.Keywords water-damaged building mycotoxins hypothyroid symptoms triiodothyronine stress intolerance latent adrenal insufficiency FT3rT3 ratio DiO2inTrODUcTiOnLong-term exposure to molds in water-damaged buildings WDB has been associated with numerous health problems including allergic airway symptoms - fungal sinusitis    abnormalities in T and B cells - infection sensitivity  asthma - respiratory infections    central and peripheral neuropathy and polyendocrinopathy  neuro- logic symptoms    neuropsychological cognitive dysfunc-tion CD - neuropsychiatric symptoms    and chronic fatigue CF   .

It is now well established that mold and mycotoxins are important constituents of the milieu in WDB and that they can provoke a huge spectrum of illnesses     -.Exposure to volatile organic compounds including metabolites produced by toxigenic fungi some of which are inflammatory agents can lead to a deficiency or imbalance of many hormones such as insufficient amounts of the active form of thyroid hor- mone commonly abbreviated to T3 hormone  .Thyroid hormones play a very important role in development growth and glucose-fat-protein metabolic homeostasis in all tis- sues by affecting the expression of many genes.

In particular DIO2 regulates the activities of thyroid hormone action by metabolizing the precursor molecule thyroxine T4 that is secreted by the thyroid gland into the biologically active molecule T3.
