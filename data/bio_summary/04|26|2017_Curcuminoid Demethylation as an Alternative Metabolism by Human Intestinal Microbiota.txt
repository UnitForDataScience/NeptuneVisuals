For the eluent gradient system solution B was started at 20 and increased to 40 in 8 min to 50 in 12 min to 55 in 15 min to70 in 20 min to 80 in 22 min and finally to 20 in 30 min.Biotransformation of Curcuminoids.

In a linear gradient the composition was changed to 30 solvent B in 5 min 40 solvent B in 15 min 60 solvent B in 20 min and 80 solvent B in 22 min and then 20 solvent B remained for 2 min at a flow rate of 0.2 mLmin.

The substrate curcumin 1 at the retention time of 14.42 min started to form the metabolite A at the retention time of 12.48 min after 3 h and metabolite C appeared at the retention time of 10.80 min after 6 h. As metabolite A decreased over 30 h the formation of metabolite C increased rapidly a.

Because new curcuminoid metabolism in the human intestine was identified in this work curcuminoids 1-6 as well as the reduced curcuminoinds metabolites should be included for the study of the pharmacokinetics of curcuminoids.DISCUSSIONStudy of the metabolic pathway of dietary polyphenols in the human intestine is important for human health.

The epigenetic activity of bisdemethylcurcumin a demethylated curcumin analogue was particularly highlighted for its neuroprotective effects.The discrepancy in curcuminoid fluxes between the ratio ofintestinal metabolites from gut microbiota and the distribution of phase II metabolites in the plasma attracted our attention.
