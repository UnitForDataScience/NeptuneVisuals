because new curcuminoid metabolism in the human intestine was identified in this work curcuminoids 1-6 as well as the reduced curcuminoinds metabolites should be included for the study of the pharmacokinetics of curcuminoids.discussionstudy of the metabolic pathway of dietary polyphenols in the human intestine is important for human health.

it is estimatedstudy of curcuminoids as a valuable bioactive ingredient.that 75 of ingested curcuminoids are excreted from the body without absorption and 1 are found as metabolites in circulating blood.the major metabolites of curcumin in the plasma are curcumin glucuronide curcumin sulfate and hexahydrocurcumin.a series of reduced curcumin metabolites are also produced by intestinal bacteria such as escherichia coli and escherichia fergusonii.the enzyme responsible for the reduction was purified and characterized as a nadph- dependent reductase.one the other hand many curcumin derivatives have been synthesized to improve the bioavailability and pharmacologicalmaterials and methodsthe experimental protocol was evaluated and approved by theinstitutional review board of chung-ang university approval 1041078-201502-br-029-01.received march 1 2017revisedapril 8 2017accepted april 12 2017published april 12 2017c 2017 american chemical society3305doi figure 2. hplc chromatogram changes 425 nm of the curcuminoid mixture metabolism by blautia sp.
