fecal ph was significantly reduced after 6 wks 7.5 g ax supplementation compared to placebo p 0.012. six wks daily intake of both 7.5 g and 15 g ax increased the con- centration of total scfa compared to a decrease in the placebo group the difference being statistically significant 7.5 g ax p 0.012 15 g ax p 0.006. the same was observed for fecal concentrations of acetate 7.5 g ax p 0.038 15 g ax p 0.016 and butyrate 7.5 g ax p 0.001 15 g ax p 0.030. fecal pro- pionate concentrations significantly increased in the 15 g ax group compared to placebo p 0.026 ax intake versus placebo did not affect fecal ammonium concentrations 7.5 g ax p 0.111 15 g ax p 0.370. no significant differences between interventions were seen in fecal ph ammonium and scfa concentrations after 3 wks supplementation all p 2 0.082 data not shown.production of cytokines by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cellsproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnfa by stimu- lated pbmcs was significantly reduced after 6 weeks 15 g ax intaketable 6fecal ph ammonium mgl and short-chain fatty acid concentrations mmolg feces at baseline and after 6 wks supplementation.differences between placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax tested with linear mixed model with correction for baseline values.

the placebo group received per day two sachets each containing 7.5 gmaltodextrin the 7.5 g ax group received per day two sachets each containing 3.75 g ax combined with 3.75 g maltodextrin and the 15 g ax group received per day two sachets each containing 7.5 g ax.

firstly fasted volunteers emptied their bladder and drank the multi-sugar drink consisting of 1 g lactulose centrafarm etten-leur the netherlands 0.5 g l-rhamnose danisco copenhangen denmark 1 g erythritol now foods bloomindale il usa 1 g sucralose brenntag sittard the netherlands and 1 g sucrose van gilse dinteloord the netherlands dissolved in 150 ml tap water.

differences in gut barrier function fecal ph relative abundance of main phylo of the fecal microbiota alpha diversity metrics fecal scfa concentrations immune response blood parameters and digestive tolerance between pla- cebo and 7.5 g ax and placebo and 15 g ax were assessed using linear mixed models with group placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax time 0 3 and 6 wks for ax effect and grouptime as fixed factors where an unstructured covariance structure was used for repeated measures.

furthermore a trend towards upregulation of the tj protein occludin was seen after 15 g ax intake compared to placebo p 0.057. in the 7.5 g ax group we observed a significant upre- gulation of occludin compared to placebo p 0.031. no significant changes in gene transcription for mlck and zo-1 between both ax groups and the placebo group were observed all p 2 0.087.protein concentration of claudin-3 zo-1 and occludinat baseline protein concentrations of claudin-3 were 6.10 - 0.61 mean - sem 4.92 - 0.41 and 7.02 - 1.49 pg claudin-3 per ug protein for placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax respectively.

1. relative abundance of the main phyla according the 16s-targeted illumina data for placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax at baseline 0 after 3 wks supplementation 3 and after 6 wks supplementation 6. no significant differences in relative abundance be- tween placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax were during study period observed as tested with linear mixed model with correction for baseline values.

participants were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to one of the three intervention arms 7.5 g ax 15 g ax or a placebo 15 g maltodextrin.

however gene transcription of occludin was upregulated in the 7.5 g ax group and transcription of claudin-3 and claudin-4 were upregulated in the 15 g ax group compared to placebo.

subjects completed these questionnaires at weekly intervals during the study period.statistical analysesthe primary outcome of the study was the effect of 6 wks 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax supplementation on gi permeability compared to placebo.

to determine the effect of intervention on the shared diversity between samples beta diversity metrics bc dissimilarity were calculated for placebo versus 7.5 g ax and placebo versus 15 g ax.

a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bc similarity distances was used in order to visualize the microbial variation among placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax.

for all comparisons two-sided p-values 0.05 were considered sta- tistically significant.resultsstudy subjectsa total of 47 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study 14 subjects were assigned to the placebo group 16 subjects to the ax7.5 g group and 17 subjects to the ax 15 g group.

1. sigmoidoscopy was performed in 9 participants in the placebo group 9 participants in the 7.5 g ax group and 8 participants in the 15 g ax group.

gastroduodenal permeability as indicated by the sucrose excretion in the 0e5 h urine fraction did not significantly change after both 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax supplementation compared totable 2gastrointestinal permeability reflected by urinary sugar excretion mmol and ratios of excreted sugars in 0e5 5e24 and 0e24 h fraction in lean and overweight and obese subjects.differences between lean subjects and overweight and obese subjects tested with mannewhitney u test.

at baseline aucs of zo-1 were 159 - 34 mean - sem 126 - 33 and 177 - 41 and of occludin 112 - 19142 - 35 and 140 - 29 for placebo 7.5 g ax and 15 g ax respec- tively.
