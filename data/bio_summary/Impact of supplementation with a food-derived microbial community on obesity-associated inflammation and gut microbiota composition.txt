This inflammatory status arising locally and then becoming systemic triggers the onset of other diseases frequently associated with obesity such as the metabolic syndrome characterised by visceral obesity high blood pressure insulin resistance high circula- ting triglyceride levels and low HDL cholesterol leading in turn to increased risk of cardiovascular dis- eases -The gut microbiota has recently attracted muchattention as a crucial factor associated with obesity Alterations of intestinal microbial composition in terms of bacterial phyla and classes associated with improved energy extraction from the undigested diet- ary carbohydrate component were identified in obese human subjects and animal obesity models with consequent impact on host metabolism and energy storage  Both diet- and genetically induced obes- ity were shown to associate with imbalance in the relative proportion of Gram-negative Bacteroidetesand Gram-positive Firmicutes the two major phyla of gut bacteria with the latter prevailing in obese sub- jects  However imbalance in these two bacterial phyla is not sufficient by itself to determine the obes- ity phenotype.

As an alternative to commercially available probiotic strains a natural source of live bacteria is represented by fermented foods which also confer the advantage of providing the host with a complex microbiota containing several environmental strains with potential probiotic fea- tures such as the capability to transiently colonise animal and human gut and interact with the resident gut microbiota mainly at a trophic level  Increasing scientific interest in fermented foods was also recently boosted by their possible use as models for more complex microbiota such as the gut .

There is growing evi- dence that probiotic andor prebiotic supplementation can positively modulate gut microbiota thus repre- senting important assets in the management of obes- ity  The probiotic component of the gut microbiota can confer health benefits to the host mainly acting on immunomodulation and positively influencing intestinal microbial balance .

Our results confirmed that gut microbiota composition was indeed affected by HFD leading to the establishment of an increased FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio typical of the obesity pattern  Bacterial supplementation was not able to overcome HFD-induced effects on gut microbial profile as no substantial modifications in faecal microbiota composition could be observed over time by NGS.

The immunomodulatory activity exerted by the MBC microbiota could be due to synergistic interactions within the microbial consortium highlighting the important role of dietary microbes with yet uncharacterised probiotic effect.Keywords Chronic inflammation Fermented dairy Foodborne microbiota White adipose tissue High fat diet Correspondence Food and Nutrition Research Centre Council for Agricultural Research and Economics CREA Via Ardeatina 546 00178 Rome Italyc The Authors.

lactis species representing two major components of the MBC microbiota were detected exclusively in faecal samples of MBC-supplemented mice although at very low abundance Additional file Table S1.DiscussionIn this work we investigated the effects of a complex foodborne bacterial community MBC microbiota on obesity-associated inflammation and gut microbiota composition in a HFD-induced obese mouse model.

The aim of our work was to evaluate the impact of supplementation with a complex foodborne bacterial consortium on obesity-associated inflammation and gut microbiota composition in a mouse model.Methods C57BL6J mice fed a 45 high fat diet HFD for 90 days were supplemented with a mixture of foodborne lactic acid bacteria derived from the traditional fermented dairy product Mozzarella di Bufala Campana MBC or with the commercial probiotic GG strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG.

clearly shows that dietary perturbations can lead to permanent loss of specific gut bacterial taxa due to negative selection of metabolic ac- tivities that become unnecessary under imbalanced diet- ary regimens These results point at limitations in microbiota resilience occurring under extreme condi- tions such as HFD-induced obesity where the alter- ations cannot be reversed by simple dietary intervention if not accompanied by specific bacterial supplementation aimed at restoring the lost taxa.
