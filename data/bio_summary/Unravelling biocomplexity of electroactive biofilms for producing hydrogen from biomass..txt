Additionally as described in the community anal- ysis section some b-Proteobacteria were found to per- sist during pure acetic acid experiments and thus could be diverting a small portion of acetic acid during open- circuit stimulus.Considering the acetic acid production rate of8.6 mg h-1 during open-circuit conditions compared with the acetic acid removal rate of 58.7 mg h-1 achieved using 0.5 g COD l-1 of pure acetic acid Additional File1 Table S3 it is clear that the exoelectrogenic microbial subpopulation is capable of converting acetic acid at higher rates than it is being produced from BOAP.

Continued efforts in these areas can lead to the development of an optimal microbial community manage- ment strategy for developing stable and high-performing electroactive biofilms while contributing to overall strate- gies for engineering microbial communities for additional industrial applications.ConclusionsRenewable H2 production from biomass-derived streams is approaching targets for practical application utilizing bioelectrochemical systems that leverage the emergent capabilities of microbial communities.

The follow- ing coupled investigations were conducted to parse the effects of the interacting parametersConversion of BOAP under poised conditionsConversion of acetic acid under poised conditionsConversion of BOAP under open-circuit conditions to assess fermentative conversion while restricting exo- electrogenesisThe underlying hypothesis we investigate is that the formation of acetic acid from the complex BOAP sub- strate is rate limiting.

Approximately 43.20 of the elec- tron equivalents present in the substrate were converted to acetic acid during the first two hours of open-circuit stimulus which increased to 68.3 by the end of 4 h. These results demonstrate that acetic acid is the major collective fermentation end-product from the communityFig.

Additionally their concentra- tion was an order of magnitude lower than acetic acid indicating that acetic acid was the dominant branching point to exoelectrogenesis.

With BOAP as the substrate the methanogenic Euryarchaeota increased from 2.2 to 17.2 while their population decreased from 13.1 to 1.8 with acetic acid as the substrate.Two inferences can be derived from these results.First batch additions of acetic acid as well as BOAP provide a large amount of acetate which is preferred by Geobacter for growth and exoelectrogenesis thusTable 1.

An experiment conducted after acetic acid run using BOAP as the substrate showed similar hydro- gen productivity as that prior to the use of acetic acid as substrate in the MECAdditional File Fig.

The comparative studies with BOAP and acetic acid show that the micro- bial groups were established and enriched in the anode to collectively participate in a fermentative chain that is capable of oxidizing the complex carbon compounds within BOAP progressively to acetic acid.

This pathway generates acetic acid and thus the con- version of levoglucosan to acetic acid can occur in a sin- gle organism.
