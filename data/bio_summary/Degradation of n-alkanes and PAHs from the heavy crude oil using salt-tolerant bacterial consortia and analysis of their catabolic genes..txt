The GCMS mean values for the n-alkane degradation in HCO by individual strains and HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium were signif- icantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared with the control by one-way ANOVA and t test analysis.In PAH degradation by individual strains HRJ5 showed the uppermost degradation mg g-1 of bicyclic AHs 2.4547 and pentacyclic AHs 0.4171 as compared to the CK 4.4636 and 0.9948 respectively.

The mean values of alkB gene copies in the HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium were significantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared to the individual strains by one-way ANOVA and t test analysis.Similarly the copy numbers of the nah gene gene copies l-1 of degradation broth at 12 days were as follows HRJ5 2.930 - 0.006 x 103 HRJ6 2.220 - 0.006 x 103 HRJ21.190 - 0.001 x 103 and HRJ4 1.110 - 0.004 x 103.Nevertheless the uppermost nah gene copies were detected inHRJ2HRJ4HRJ5HRJ6HRJ2456B44 Days12 Daysthe HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium 3.470 - 0.010 x 103 Fig.

From these results it could be stated that all strains in the reconstituted consortium degraded the HCO with a predominance of HRJ4 and HRJ6 strains in the liquid medium.Relative abundance of alkB and nah genes in HCO degradation mediumIn this study alkB and nah genes responsible for n-alkane and PAH degradation were assessed using quantitative PCR assaysFig.

All the mean values for HCO degradation percentage of TPH TSH and TAH by the individual strains and consortia were significantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared to the control CK by one-way ANOVA and t test analysis.The protein contents of the HCO degradation medium were increased quickly in the individual strains and HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium within the first 4 days whereas further incuba- tion until 8 and 12 days showed a slow increase in the content Table .

The mean values of TSH and TAH degradation were significantly higher in consortium P  0.0001 P  0.05 by one-way ANOVA and t test analysisAlthough the HCO-degrading strains were isolates from a similar oil-contaminated site it was a crucial need to check their growth and degradation efficiency when used in consortia.

The GCMS mean values for the 16 PAH degradation in HCO by individual strains and HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium were significantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared with the control by one- way ANOVA and t test analysis.In this study small-chain n-alkanes C10-C20 were first utilized for degradation while those with the longer-chain lengths C20-C40 were found to be difficult to biodegrade due to their low bioavailability which was in agreement with the previous studies of Kaczorek and Olszanowski  and Guermouche M'rassi et al.

The DGGE bands at the fifth lane of the 12 day consortium showed two bands with higher intensity which corresponds to the strains HRJ4 and HRJ6 which were responsible for the highest degradation of alkanes C8-C40 and bicyclic tricy- clic tetracyclic pentacyclic and hexacyclic PAHs 16 PAHs respectively.

However the salt-tolerant consortium HRJ2  4  5  6 demonstrated the highest degradation of TPH 66.30 and re- duced the toxicity of HCO considerably without addition of any external biostimulant.In this study the maximum degradation of n-alkanes and PAHs was achieved by the four-membered consortium which contained two strains from the genus Dietzia and other two from Corynebacterium and Bacillus.

The GCMS investigation for degradation of different chain lengths of n-alkanes C8-C40 by individual strains showed the highest degradation of C8-C19 HRJ5 C20-C30 HRJ4 and C31-C40 HRJ5 respectively.
