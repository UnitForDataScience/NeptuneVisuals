The mean values of alkB gene copies in the HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium were significantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared to the individual strains by one-way ANOVA and t test analysis.Similarly the copy numbers of the nah gene gene copies l-1 of degradation broth at 12 days were as follows HRJ5 2.930 - 0.006 x 103 HRJ6 2.220 - 0.006 x 103 HRJ21.190 - 0.001 x 103 and HRJ4 1.110 - 0.004 x 103.Nevertheless the uppermost nah gene copies were detected inHRJ2HRJ4HRJ5HRJ6HRJ2456B44 Days12 Daysthe HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium 3.470 - 0.010 x 103 Fig.

All the mean values for HCO degradation percentage of TPH TSH and TAH by the individual strains and consortia were significantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared to the control CK by one-way ANOVA and t test analysis.The protein contents of the HCO degradation medium were increased quickly in the individual strains and HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium within the first 4 days whereas further incuba- tion until 8 and 12 days showed a slow increase in the content Table .

The GCMS mean values for the n-alkane degradation in HCO by individual strains and HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium were signif- icantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared with the control by one-way ANOVA and t test analysis.In PAH degradation by individual strains HRJ5 showed the uppermost degradation mg g-1 of bicyclic AHs 2.4547 and pentacyclic AHs 0.4171 as compared to the CK 4.4636 and 0.9948 respectively.

The GCMS mean values for the 16 PAH degradation in HCO by individual strains and HRJ2  4  5  6 consortium were significantly higher P  0.0001 P  0.05 as compared with the control by one- way ANOVA and t test analysis.In this study small-chain n-alkanes C10-C20 were first utilized for degradation while those with the longer-chain lengths C20-C40 were found to be difficult to biodegrade due to their low bioavailability which was in agreement with the previous studies of Kaczorek and Olszanowski  and Guermouche M'rassi et al.
