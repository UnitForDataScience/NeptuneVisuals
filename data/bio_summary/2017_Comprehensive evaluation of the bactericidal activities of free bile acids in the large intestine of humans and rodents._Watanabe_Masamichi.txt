Among the 7-hydroxy-type FBAs UCA and UDCA which are common to humans and rodents showed lower pH- dissipating activities than did their 7-hydroxy epimer FBAs CA and CDCA respectively.Effect of FBAs on the cell membrane integrity and viability of B. breve JCM 1192T B. coccoides JCM 1395T and B. thetaiotaomicron DSM 2079TFirst based on estimation of the toxicity of each FBA by intracellular pH measurements we investigated the membrane integrity and viability of JCM 1192T upon expo- sure to FBAs Table 2.

FBAs com- monly found in both humans and rodents are classified as common FBAs CA UCA UDCA DCA CDCA 7-oxo-DCA 7-oxo-LCA 12-oxo-LCA and 3-oxo-12 while those specific to rodents are termed rodent FBAs -MCA -MCA -MCA -MCA and HDCA Table 1.Bacterial strains and culture conditionsB.

In addition the observed coordinated reduc- tions in both membrane integrity and viable cell count led us to conclude that the mechanism underlying the bactericidal activity of FBAs in humans and rodents can generally be extended to their damaging effect on bacte- rial cell membranes as reported previously for CA and DCA 7.To demonstrate the bactericidal activities of human androdent FBAs toward bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla we investigated the membrane in- tegrity and viability of B. coccoides JCM 1395T and B. thetaio- taomicron DSM 2079T after exposure to rodent FBAs as well as CA and DCA at the viability loss-inducing concentra- tions determined for B. breve JCM 1192T.

Here we investigated the toxicity of 14 typical human and rodent free bile acids FBAs by monitor- ing intracellular pH membrane integrity and viability of a human intestinal bacterium Bifidobacterium breve Japan Col- lection of Microorganisms JCM 1192T upon exposure to these FBAs.

These findings will help us to determine the fundamental proper- ties of FBAs and better understand the role of FBAs in the regulation of gut microbiota composition.--Watanabe M.S.

Oxo-type FBAs 7-oxo-DCA 3-oxo-12 12-oxo-LCA and 7-oxo-LCA showed weaker pH-dissipating activities than those induced by their corresponding -hydroxyl-type FBAs CA corresponding oxo-type FBA 7-oxo-DCA DCA 3-oxo-12 12-oxo-LCA and CDCA 7-oxo-LCA Fig.

In contrast to the common FBAs rodent FBAs did not exhibit a correlation between k' and bactericidal activity data not shown.

3.In contrast to the common FBAs rodent FBAs did not show these correlations as the hydrophilic -MCA showed the toxicity at a level comparable to that of DCA Table 2.

Taking these into consideration one possi- ble explanation for the relatively high bactericidal activities exhibited by rodent FBAs is that the highly hydrophilic structure of rodent FBA molecules may facilitate forma- tion of the face-to-face dimer more tightly than that in the common FBAs due to the increased hydrophilicity of the - faces of the bile acid molecules that face each other.

Among the common FBAs the bactericidal activities of -hydroxy FBAs were higher than those of their oxo-derivatives and -epimers and their hydrophobicities as determined by UPLCESI-MS correlated well with their bactericidal activities.
