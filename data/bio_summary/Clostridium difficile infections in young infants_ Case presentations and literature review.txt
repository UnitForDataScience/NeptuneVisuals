To estab- lish a causative relationship between toxigenic C. difficile and presence of clinical symptoms detailed insight in the pre- and post-treatment composition of the intestinal microbiota preferably by means of mo- lecular microbiota detection techniques could shed light on this di- lemma.Alternatively demonstration of the presence of intestinal C. difficiletoxin receptors in neonates and young infants could scientifically sup- port the hypothesis that symptomatic C. difficile infections do occur in this specific population and should therefore be the focus of future studies.Clostridium testingCurrently several tests are available for the detection of toxigenic C. difficile in feces  based on culture enzyme immunoassay or polymerase chain reaction .

C. difficile-associated diarrhea is caused by toxigenic strains characterized by the production of toxins including enterotoxin C. difficile toxin A and cytotoxin C. difficiletoxin B.

The subgroup oftoxigenic C. difficile strains consisted of different ribotypes with highlyvariable virulence phenotypes including the hypervirulent 027 ribo- type .Although in adults and older children toxigenic C. difficile is widelyaccepted as cause of bloody diarrhea less consensus exists on the potential of C. difficile as causative pathogen of bloody diarrhea in neonates and young infants up to 2 years of age.

C. difficile testing on fecal samples was positive C. difficile toxin gene PCR testing was positive C. difficile could be cultured from feces and toxins could be demonstrated in the feces by EAI.

Although fecal transplantation in recurrent C. difficile infections in adults has been proven superior as therapy compared to prolonged antibiotic treatment studies on efficacy of this relatively novel therapeutic approach in children with recurrent C. difficile infections are currently lacking .ConclusionBased on the assumption that symptomatic C. difficile infections do not occur in children below two years of age current policy of several microbial laboratories is not to test for these infections in this specific population.

We present two young infants with recurrent bloody diarrhea following antimicrobial therapy positive testing for toxigenic C. difficile and successfully treated with metronidazole and vancomycin and provide an overview of the literature on C. difficile infections in children under two years of age.

At follow-up C. difficile PCR culture and toxin testing were negative.DiscussionFor considerable time it has been assumed that symptomatic in- fections do not occur in neonates and young infants although coloni- zation rate with C. difficile is very high in this specific age-group .

It was advised to look for alternative etiologies even in those infants with a positive test result for C. difficile .However reports discussing pathophysiological mechanisms on how young infants may be protected from developing symptomatic C. difficile infections have not been substantiated by robust scientific data and are merely hypothetical.
