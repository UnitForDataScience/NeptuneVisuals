The network also showed a cluster of genes related to metabolic function including AKR1C family genes TREH SPR downregulated in the jejunum and CPO upregulated.586SEGMENT-SPECIFIC RESPONSES OF INTESTINE TO ANTIBIOTICSFig.

In-feed antibiotics increase the expres- sion of genes involved in immune and antigen processes in both the jejunum and ileum while genes related to metabolic processes are altered predominantly only in the jejunum.

The nodes represent genes the weights of the edges represent how specifically two genes are associated together and the colors indicate the jejunum- specific ileum-specific or overlapping DEGs.

The results indicate that in-feed antibiotics increased expression of genes involved in immune functions in both the jejunum and ileum some of which were clustered in the coexpression network.

Numbers for total differentially expressed genes DEGs as well as the up- and downregulated genes are given.

Of the 2 dashed circles 1 includes a cluster of genes related to metabolic function and another in- cludes a cluster of genes related to immune function.two intestinal tissues before and after antibiotic treatment.

Although the magnitude of fold change obtained by the two methods was different in some instances the expres- sion trends of these genes remained similar.Correlation between bacterial abundance and intestinal genes expression.

The correlations between bacterial abundance and intestinal genes expression were assessed by Pearson's correlation test.

The effect of antibiotic cocktail administration on the microbiota was evaluated by DGGE analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes.

The expression patterns of the selected genes in different groups derived from RNA-Seq and qPCR experiments are shown in Fig.
