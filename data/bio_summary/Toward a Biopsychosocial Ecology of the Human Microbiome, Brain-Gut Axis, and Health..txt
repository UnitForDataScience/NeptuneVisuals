Culture of previously uncultured members of the human gut microbiota by culturomics.

With the human microbiome advanced modeling approaches may provide insight to the stability and complex dynamics of the microbiota over time 22 and help us begin to appreciate the more complete ecology of the microbiome within the host 23 and the broader context of the natural environment 591314.Ecological models of health behavior 24-26 chronic pain27 and human development 28 have advanced our under- standing of the complex determinants of human health across various levels of influence.

Richness of human gut microbiome correlates with metabolic markers.

Indeed there is growing consideration of dysbiosis imbalancedisruption of the microbiota and critical host- microbiota interactions in disease rather than the simple pres- ence or absence of specific taxa 8-1132.Host genes may interact with other factors to influence compo- sition of the gut microbiome 3334 and in turn microbes may exert epigenetic effects 35 and shape their immediate environ- ments in profound ways by producing biofilms and metabolites 36.

In this context the gut microbiota may be integral to fundamental processes including brain development and function 4143 and may play a signifi- cant role in metabolic processes obesity and eating-related behav- ioral propensities in animals and humans 44-48.The microbiota also seems to play a role in the development and regulation of the immune system relevant to inflammation autoimmune diseases and neurological conditions 394950.

Finally animal models of autistic spectrum disorders suggest that behaviors associated with sociability may be affected by health of the gut microbiota and its immedi- ate host environment 5666.Intermediate SystemsA range of factors may be considered at the intermediate scale of analysis that operate between the proximal-level systems just described and the most distal.
