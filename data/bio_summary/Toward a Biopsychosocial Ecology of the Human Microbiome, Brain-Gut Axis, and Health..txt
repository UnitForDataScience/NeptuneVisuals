With the human microbiome advanced modeling approaches may provide insight to the stability and complex dynamics of the microbiota over time 22 and help us begin to appreciate the more complete ecology of the microbiome within the host 23 and the broader context of the natural environment 591314.Ecological models of health behavior 24-26 chronic pain27 and human development 28 have advanced our under- standing of the complex determinants of human health across various levels of influence.

In covering multiple bodies of literature we encourage readers to consider the many possibil- ities for developing interdisciplinary research initiatives reflecting this ecological concept.ImmediateMicro SystemsThe human gut microbiota and microbiome more broadly are increasingly appreciated as ecological systems representing the dynamic interplay of human factors e.g.

Although technological advances in the area of microbiome technology hold some promise for addressing some of these environmental chal- lenges through microbes themselves 134 the still unfoldingstory of antibiotic effects on health and environment should under- score the importance of foresight and humility regarding the risks and limits of current technology to intervene in systems that have evolved over millions of years.CONCLUSIONSSince the time of Forbes' observations about basic ecology 1 and the discovery of pathogens we have made significant but still lim- ited advances in understanding our microbial world in general and in how the gut microbiota relates to health.

 REVIEWToward a Biopsychosocial Ecology of the Human Microbiome Brain-Gut Axis and HealthKarl J. Maier PhD and Mustafa al'Absi PhDABSTRACTObjective Rapidly expanding insights into the human microbiome and health suggest that Western medicine is poised for significant evo- lution or perhaps revolution--this while medicine continues on a trajectory from reductionism to a biopsychosocial BPS paradigm rec- ognizing biological psychological and social influences on health.

The extent of an indi- vidual's awareness of these factors determines the extent to which they are psychologically affected by these environmental and social processes and conversely to what extent they will- fully engage in determining them.The World Health Organization One Health and other global entities have identified global ecological health and biodiver- sity in particular at all levels including microbes as the pri- mary determinants of human health 78.

Indeed there is growing consideration of dysbiosis imbalancedisruption of the microbiota and critical host- microbiota interactions in disease rather than the simple pres- ence or absence of specific taxa 8-1132.Host genes may interact with other factors to influence compo- sition of the gut microbiome 3334 and in turn microbes may exert epigenetic effects 35 and shape their immediate environ- ments in profound ways by producing biofilms and metabolites 36.
