up-side down red triangles represent puppies at 2 days old blue squares represent puppies at 21 days old sideways orange triangles represent puppies at 42 days old right-side up green triangles represent puppies at 56 days old and lastly purple circles represent the dams of the puppies.

contains summary statistics for picrust results expressed as a percent of total ko output for each time point belonging to the puppies and the dams.discussionthis study describes and characterizes the fecal microbial profile of puppies from 2 days 21 days 42 days and 56 days post-natal development.

the panel a cladogram describing differentially abundant functional gene families between 2 and 56 days after birth in puppies significant features based on lda threshold of  3.5. panel b cladogram describing differentially abundant bacteria between puppies at 56 days of age and their mothers significant features based on lda threshold of  2.0.dams harbored significantly increased ko compared to puppies at 56 days of age belonging to thiamine metabolism fatty acid metabolism valineleucineisoleucine degradation and seleno compound metabolism.

in the present study puppies at 21 days old were considered to still be drinking milk by 42 days it varied among breeds but by 56 days all puppies were eating almost exclusively solid food.

species richness continued to increase significantly from 2 days of age until 42 days of age in puppies.

major phylogenetic changes were noted at all taxonomic levels with the most profound changes being a shift from primarily firmicutes in puppies at 2 days of age to a co-dominance of bacteroidetes fusobacteria and firmicutes by 21 days of age.

microbial communities were found to cluster separately between 2 21 and 42 days of age anosim p  0.001. in addition the microbial communities belonging to puppies at 56 days of age clustered separately from their mothers anosim p  0.001. summa- rizes comparisons with p-values and r statistic.

for observed species puppies at 21 and 42 days of age harbored signifi- cantly increased species richness compared to 2 days of age anova p  0.0001. summary statistics for all alpha diversity metrics analyzed are provided in  and rarefaction curves representing the observed species in addition to sequencing depth are displayed in panel b.major phylogenetic differences during pre-weaning developmentanalysis of bacterial groups using univariate repeated measures testing showed that 5 out of 8 phyla 12 out of 15 classes 18 out of 23 orders 27 out of 52 families 48 out of 109 genera and 56 out of 137 species were identified as having a significant difference between time points q0.05.

on the phylum level the percent of sequences belonging to firmicutes dominated the fecal microbiota at 2 days of age median percent of sequences  64.3 compared with days 21 42 and 56 median percent of sequences  26.11 22.25 and 22.29 respectively q0.0001.

lefse was used to identify global changes in the percent of sequences belonging to any level of bacterial group between puppies at 2 days old and puppies at 56 days old.

panel a shows a cladogram with differentially abundant taxa.major phylogenetic changes between puppies at 56 days of age and their mothersunivariate analysis identified 3 out of 8 phyla 5 out of 15 classes 7 out of 23 orders 4 out of 49 families 2 out of 96 genera and 3 out of 123 species as having a significant difference in the percent of sequences belonging to either the puppies at 56 days of age or the dams q0.05.on the phylum level the three most abundant phyla for both dams and their puppies at 56 summary statistics for species richness i.e.
