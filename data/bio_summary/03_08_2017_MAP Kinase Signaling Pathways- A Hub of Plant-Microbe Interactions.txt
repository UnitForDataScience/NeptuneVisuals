The cell-surface- localized immune receptors are structur- ally related receptor kinases RKs or receptor-like proteins RLPs whereas cytoplasmic immune receptors are nucle- otide-binding leucine-rich repeat domain proteins NLRs the latter also exists in animals.

In the decade since many more effectors have been found to inhibit MAP kinase cascades providing not only a mecha- nistic understanding of pathogenesis and immunity in plants but also the identification of previously unknown enzymes.IntroductionMolecular genetic studies at the end of last millennium uncovered a plant surveil- lance system consisting of innate immune receptors localized at the cell surface and within the cytoplasm.

This activation-dependent destruc- tion of a host component is particularly important for the bacterium as excessive perturbation of the host immune system often results in elevating defenses in the host plant.A MAPK Cascade Guarded by an NLRInvestigation of biochemical function of pathogen effector proteins also advanced our understanding of mechanisms by which plant NLRs recognize specific pathogen effectors.

Findings from the inves- tigations of these effectors not only lend strong support for the two-tiered plant innate immune system proposal but also revealed novel enzymes.

In plants these immune recep- tors directly or indirectly recognize spe- cific ''avirulence'' proteins produced by microbial pathogens and activate protec- tive immune responses.

Parallel studies searching for plant receptors for path- ogen-derived ''elicitors'' or pathogen- associated molecular patterns PAMPs such as bacterial flagellin and the fungal cell wall component chitin identified additional immune RKs and RLPs that are functionally analogous to Toll-like re- ceptors TLRs in animals  .

syringae mutant strains lacking the type III secretion system were found to activate plant immune responses that are normally suppressed by wild-type strains suggesting that type III effectors T3Es actively suppress immunity .

These findings coincided with the proposal of a two-tiered plant innate immune system .

This Commentary sum- marizes what we have learned in the last decade from effectors that inhibit MAP kinase MAPK signaling in plants.Pathogen Effectors Directly Targeting MAPK CascadesThe characterization of the P. syringae T3E HopAI1 provided a mechanistic un- derstanding of how a plant pathogen effector inhibits PRR-mediated immune signaling.

It was soon realized that the pathogens' so- called avirulence proteins are effectors that first evolved to promote pathogen- esis in the plant apoplast or cytoplasm but essentially betray the pathogen when they are sensed by the host plant's surveillance system.
