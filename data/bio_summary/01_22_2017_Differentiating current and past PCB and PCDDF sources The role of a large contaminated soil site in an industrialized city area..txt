si-2 that the main congeners responsible for the measured and predicted concentra- tions are some of the indicator pcbs from pcb 28 to pcb 52 and pcb 101.comparison between pcddf fingerprints of measured samples and predicted datasimilar to what was shown above predicted pcddsfs air con- centrations using the soil concentrations measured for each chlorination class as input were compared to the measured air concentrations as well as for fingerprints of selected sources re- ported from .

average total pcbs sum of homologues for each class of chlorination measured in the samples were about 1e2 mgkg d.w. in the three pooled samples table si 5. pcb 209 represented the most abundant congener 10e27 of total pcbs with concentration between 0.14 and0.43 mgkg d.w. it has to be noted that pcb 209 was not measured originally when the agricultural area contamination was found by the regional authorities in 2001 therefore the presence of this congener considerably raises the levels of total pcbs obtained previously.

although the presence of so many contaminants may deserve attention further considerations will be mostly centered on pcb and pcddf.comparison between pcb fingerprints of measured samples and predicted datasince air concentrations and some emission fingerprints from incinerators and industrial sources mainly were available in pre- viously published papers   we decided to evaluate the hypothesis that pcb concentra- tion in air was related to soil secondary emission possibly370a.

this is consistent with the much higher pcdf concentrations than pcdds in soils and the origin of pcdfs as pcb impurities travelling and redistributing to the agricultural soils with irrigation.the comparison between the fingerprints in air of predicted and measured concentrations showed that the contaminated area doesnot significantly affect air concentrations for pcdds while this seems more evident for pcdfs especially for less chlorinated and more volatile congeners although some current sources are apparently more influent for more chlorinated congeners.

additionally the air concentrations measured in brescia were substantially higher than background concentrations for pcbs hundreds to thousands pgm3 for total pcbs and average for pcddfs 0.04e0.05 pg who05-teqm3 .

pcb 209 resulted from the production of fenclor dk containing prevalently the decachlorinated congener which characterized and can be considered a marker of the brescia caffaro site .pcddfs tables si 6 and 7 concentrations were between 19 and 60 pg who05-teqg 26e77 pg i-teqg which is considerably higher than the average for surface soil measured in the same re- gion  pavia province which can be considered a control area 3.18 pg i-teqg and they are comparable to pcddf concentrations found in soils affected by industrial accidents  or sewage sludge .

these concentrations were then used as starting soil loadings in a dynamic airsoil model developed by our group soilplus  to predict air concentrations resulting from chemical volatilization from soils which were compared to measured air concentrations .

sources were selected basing on the availability of representative fingerprints for dioxin and furan classes sum of all the homologues in each chlorination family measured in sur- face soils and available in the scientific literature they included soils measured at increasing distances 100e3000 m from a municipal waste incinerator in spain  soils in the vicinity 2400 m of a hospital waste incinerator in china  soils up to a few km away of an electronic waste recycling site in china  soils within a few hundred meters from some industrial sources steel plants cement plants glass production fossil fuel power stations and soil around 50 m open waste combustion sources in campania region in italy where some elevated soil concentrations were recently measured .

briefly single pcb congener and single homologue class simula- tions were run using physical chemical properties and halflives from  with pbl heights from and soil properties as in table si 1. the model was run hourly for one year for each selected pcb or pcddf homologue class setting as initial concentration the weighted average of the concentrations of the three areas.

additionally 123478-hexachlorodibenzofuran in soil is higher than the 123678- hexachlorodibenzofuran in all samples and this is a further marker of pcdfs as derived from pcb impu- rities as shown by  who measured pcdfs in commercial pcb mixtures.

the fingerprints of pcb obtained calculating 216 values pcddf 100 values concentrations in air calculated by the model were then compared to the measured fingerprints in the pca analysis.microbiological analysis 16s rrna hypervariable tag analysisthe soil samples were microbiologically analyzed to describe the diversity of bacterial communities within the studied areas in order to find a possible relation with the different contaminant fingerprint.

the predicted and measured concentrations were then compared as supplementary samples also in the other pcas using principal component anal- ysis together with fingerprints from typical pcb sources.

the pca score plot of the pcb air concentrations  shows three main clusters air samples from incinerators and tunnels form the first two clusters while the third one is the cluster of predicted measured point a to e of the colombo et al.

a comparison between measured and predicted concen- tration in air was not possible for the most abundant congener in soil pcb 209 because it was not present in the measured con- centrations dataset .

recently for another pcb production in europe slovakia the relevance of the source on impacting humanhealth was shown measuring 15 pcbs in blood serum up to 50 km in the prevailing wind direction from the factory a .in this work in order to evaluate current emissions of pcbs and pcddfs of the contaminated site e.g.
