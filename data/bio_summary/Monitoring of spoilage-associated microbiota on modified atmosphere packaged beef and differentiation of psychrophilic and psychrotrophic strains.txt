Screening for psychrophiles at 4degC on beef revealed the abundance of Leuconostoc gelidum subsp.

gelidum TMW21998 with characteristic psychrophilic growth behaviour.Conclusions We suggest that control of initial contaminants is crucial to predict the onset of spoilage and that headspace atmosphere and pH are important parameters with spoilage-indicative potential.Significance and Impact of the Study MALDI-TOF MS proved suitable for high-resolution monitoring of psychrotrophic and psychrophilic spoilage- associated microbiota and enables improved insights in the spoilage progress.

gelidum subsp.

gasi- comitatum  gelidum were identified as the most promi- nent spoilage-associated species in both batches during shelf life and beyond.
