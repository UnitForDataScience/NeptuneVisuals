Thus changes in the lung microbiome that may be related to a subject having a COPD exacerbation may be lost early on in the disease and the changes seen may be due to an antibiotic effect on the lung microbiome117.Pragman and colleagues addressed the lung microbiome of moderate and severe COPD subjects with relatively stable disease and compared them to healthy subjects.

Some of the unique challenges studying the lower airway microbiome include the technical difficulty sampling the lower respiratory tract the extremely low bacterial burden in healthy lung leading to low signal to high noise ratio and the lack of animal models to study the lung microbiome31 32.

Microaspiration occurs in normal individuals39 and its prevalence is higher in several lung diseases including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD asthma obstructive sleep apnea cystic fibrosis and lung infections due to atypical such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria and typical microorganisms40-45.Charlson and colleagues who in initial studies examined bronchoscopy results from six healthy patients and concluded that the lower respiratory tract resembled the microbiome of the upper respiratory tract 32.

Experimental approaches are needed to study how these factors affect the selection pressures that shape the lower airway microbiome.The lung environment ecosystem can also be thought of as a series of forward and feedback loops that suppresses or allows the underlying lung bacteria to grow88.

In a murine model of this theory Poroyko and colleagues conducted a study of lipopolysaccharide LPS-induced acute lung injury and studied the changes in the murine lung microbiome106.

Therefore steroid-induced suppression of MAIT cells may be responsible for the increased risk of pneumonia in subjects with airway diseases115.Unique selection pressures of the lung may have profound impact on the lung microbiome.

Most importantly host responses and medications deserve particular attention as these mechanisms remain largely unexplored in current literature in relation to their effects on the lung microbiome.The Lung Microbiome in Disease StatesMorris and colleagues studied the microbiome of healthy subjects and healthy smokers in a study of the lung microbiome 85.

Although the study did detect organisms found more abundant in the lung than in the oral cavity including Haemophilus Enterobacteriaceae and Tropheryma whipplei differences in the lung microbiota between smokers and non-smokers were not found85.
