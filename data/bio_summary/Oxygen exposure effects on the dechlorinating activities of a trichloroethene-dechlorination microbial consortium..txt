The contribution of the tceA gene to the total RDase genes tceA and vcrA genes peaked at 72.26 after 4 d andthis corresponded well with the progress of the biodegradation process because TCE was transformed into VC which is regulated by the tceA gene during the first 4 d. The amount of tceA gene pre- sent then remained stable with only slight variations while another RDase gene vcrA increased over the following days and then began to exceed the tceA gene.

Lanes 1 and 7 ladder lanes 2-6 were respectively the PCR products of D. mccartyi 16S rRNA gene pceA gene tceA gene bvcA gene and vcrA gene with specific primers as shown in .

The total amount of D. mccartyi increased to5.95 107 - 1.18 107 per mL after more than 99 of TCE had dechlorinated to ETH without the presence of DO and the D. mccartyi containing the tceA gene and the vcrA gene were the main constituent with a relative ratio of 0.87.

The qPCR analyses revealed that the D. mccartyi strains con- taining the tceA gene were less sensitive to exposure to oxygen than were the D. mccartyi strains containing the vcrA gene.

The increase in the total amount of D. mccartyi 16S rRNA gene present during the first 4 d of the experiment was mainly attributed to increases in the population of D. Mccartyi con- taining the tceA gene.

Apparently the tceA gene was involved in dechlorinating TCE to VC and the vcrA gene was participate in dechlorinating VC to ETH.

Three RDase genes are responsible for the degradation of TCE the tceA gene was found in an anaerobic enrichment culture containing D. mccar- tyi and the other two genes vcrA and bvcA were found later  .Some studies revealed that D. mccartyi strains especially single- strain cultures are very sensitive to unfavorable conditions and this has sometimes caused the biodegradation of TCE to be incom- plete.
