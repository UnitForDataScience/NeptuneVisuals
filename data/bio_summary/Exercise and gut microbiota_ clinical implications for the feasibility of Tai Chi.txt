the complex interactions among host genetics diet exercise individual habits and other environmental factors create variations in gut microbiota which plays a role in the development of obesity and diabetes.55 in animals the host genetic background may shape the gut microbiota.56 however an exploratory study investigating gut microbiota in a healthy dichorionic triplet set showed that host genetics played a role in individual gut microbiota composition at the first month and environmental factors became major determinants at the 12th months.57 the influence of host genetics on gut microbiota may be more easily attenuated by environmental factors in humans than in animals.

the association between tai chi and gut microbiota remains unknown.limitation of this reviewcurrent evidence regarding the link between exercise and gut microbiota in humans is sparse and the feasibility of tai chi to induce changes in human gut microbiota may be speculative.summarycurrent evidence suggests that exercise may increase the diversity of gut microbiota and alter the composition of microbiota at phylum family and genus levels.

in animal studies a social stressor decreased the relative abundance of the genus bacteroidetes and increased the relative abundance of the genus clostridium in the cecum.85 gut microbiota is linked to the development of the hpa axis therefore the interaction between stress and hpa response may alter gut microbiota composition.75 tai chi also significantly reduces salivary cortisol levels in healthy individuals86 and cancer survivors.87 tai chi may therefore benefit gut microbiota by decreasing stress.61 in addition several studies support the role of tai chi in enhancing vagal modulation decreasing sympathetic modulation and achieving a balance with parasympathetic dominance resulting in increased heart rate variability.88 autonomic nervous system modulation has important effects on the quality of the intestinal mucus layer where most enteric bacteria reside along with epithelial mechanisms associated with the gut immune system.29 the vagus nerve integrates the inflammatory reflex which controls the immune response and inflammation it also regulates heart rate gastrointestinal motility and other visceral functions.89 inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease are associated with autonomic dysfunction.89 ott et al.18 reported that bacteroides eubacterium and lactobacillus species were reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

microbiotas have dynamic interactions with the host immune system and diversity may influence the development of diseases.31gut microbiota composition has been associated with inflammatory bowel syndrome18 and metabolic disease32 and may improve health in older adults.33 specifically akkermansia muciniphila which was abundant in athletes is correlated with improved metabolic health due to enhanced gut barrier function.34 individuals who engage in regular high-intensity exercise may have healthy microbiota leading to the improvement of metabolic diseases.table 1 summarizes published articles that have investigated the association between exercise and gut microbiota in humans.effects of exercise on gut microbiota in mice or ratsa number of animal studies have investigated thejuly 2017 vol.

in addition the feasibility of tai chi in improving gut microbiota composition and function is discussed.methodsthe english language literature was searched for exercise and gut microbiota using pubmedmedline using the search terms exercise or physical activity gut microbiota and intestinal flora.

however we should note that maximal exercise affects gut microbiota and changes in gut microbiota differed between patients with mecfs and healthy individuals.a cross-sectional study also showed that exercise had a favorable impact on gut microbiota diversity.7 participants in that study included 40 male rugby playersathletes and 46 healthy controls.

the humangut microbiota comprises approximately 100 trillion microbes.8 firmicutes 60-65 bacteroidetes 20- 25 and proteobacteria 5-10 comprise the majority of human gut microbiota though there is considerable inter-individual variability in microbial composition.9 microbiota can be clustered into enterotypes characterized as a ratio of bacteroides prevotella or ruminococcus and are affected by long-term diet.10 exercise may affect gut microbiota though evidence for this association is limited.

interestingly voluntary exercise also attenuated polychlorinated biphenyl-induced changes in gut microbiota such as decreasing proteobacteria in mice.51 exercise may protect against chemical toxicity by changing the gut microbiota.clinical implicationsobesity is associated with a decreased bacteroidetes firmicutes ratio in both humans and mice.37-3952 weight loss through exercise or diet therapy may alter gut microbiota though the mechanism by which exercise promotes gastrointestinal health has not been clarified.53 several experimental animal studies suggested that exercise increased the bacteroidetes firmicutes ratio.

the 3-month peer-assisted tai chi program strengthens social network and improves psychosocial health in older chinese individuals who are socially isolated.67 a systematic review of randomized controlled trials has shown that tai chi appears to be effective for improving health-related quality of life in patients with musculoskeletal disorders respiratory diseases and cardiovascular disease.68 growing evidence suggests that bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders exist.69 although the underlying mechanism is not clear psychosociological effects of tai chi can be associated with the change in gut microbiota.tai chi and gut microbiotatai chi is certainly an effective mode of exercise for health benefits.

exercise stimulates gut microbiota diversity and may develop the gut immune system by enhancing the sensitivity of toll-like receptors that recognize bacterial dna.75 as a pure moderate-intensity exercise tai chi may improve gut immune function by a similar mechanism.
