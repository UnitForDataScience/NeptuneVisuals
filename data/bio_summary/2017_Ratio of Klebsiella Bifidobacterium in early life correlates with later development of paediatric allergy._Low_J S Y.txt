KMG has received reimbursement for speaking at conferences sponsored by companies selling nutritional products and is part of an academic consortium that has received research funding from Abbott Nutrition Nestec and Danone.Low et al.Page 2microbial composition and diversity of 21 allergic and 18 healthy infants at 3 weeks 3 months and 6 months of age and correlated the microbiota with allergy at ages 18 and 36 months.

Particularly noteworthy was that infants who harbored a high KlebsiellaBifidobacterium KB ratio at age 3 months had higher odds of developing allergy by ages 18 months and 3 yearsLow et al.Page 8suggesting potential clinical relevance of the KB ratio in prediction of allergy risk later in life.At age 3 months genus Klebsiella was significantly over-represented in allergic infants compared to the healthy controls.

The ratio of genera Klebsiella and Bifidobacterium at 3 months accurately predicted allergy in 12 out of the 18 infants who developed allergy by ages 18 months andLow et al.Page 1036 months giving a test sensitivity true positive rate of allergic infants of approximately 67.

Skin prick tests were also conducted in all infants at 18 months of age to assess for sensitization to common food cow's milk peanut and egg and dust mite allergens Der fDer p.Sample CollectionFaecal samples were collected from infants at 3 weeks 3 months and 6 months of age by the parents using sterile faeces containers.

Moreover approximately 50 n  10 of these allergic infants developed multiple allergy phenotypes by 36 months of age including onset of asthma Supplementary Table S1.Faecal Microbiota Profile of Allergic and Healthy InfantsA total of 117 faecal samples were collected from the 39 infants at ages 3 weeks 3 months and 6 months.

Infants who developed allergy had significantly lower microbial richness at age 3 months P  .05 but not at 3 weeks or 6 months Figure 2.Based on unweighted and weighted unifrac PCoA plots the faecal microbial composition of allergic infants and healthy controls appeared to separate along the first component at 3 months Figure 3.

Using Mann-Whitney U test we observed that the differential ratio of relative abundances of Klebsiella to Bifidobacterium were significant P  0.01 between the two groups only at 3 months but not at 3 weeks or 6 months Supplementary Table S2.Relationships Between KB Ratio and Risk of Developing AllergyTo explore further whether KB ratio could be utilized to discriminate between allergic and healthy infants at 3 months the KB ratio was compared across all infants in this study independently of their clinical phenotype.

Analysis at individual level showed that most allergic infants had a high KB ratio value - with twelve of the allergic infants ranking above the median KB ratio of this population Table 6 Figure 4.Consequently we analyzed the association of KB ratio at 3 months in relation to the risk of developing childhood allergy by ages 18 months and 36 months.
