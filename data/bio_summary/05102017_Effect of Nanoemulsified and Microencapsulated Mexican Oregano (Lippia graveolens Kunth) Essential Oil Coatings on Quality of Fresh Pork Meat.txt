muscle samples were mixed in plastic bags and randomly divided into 5 coating levels con- trol without eo coating ut modified starch coating without eo sc coated with free 8.55 mg eocm2 feo coated with same concentrations with nanoemulsified eo neo and with microencapsulated eo meo.

these differences may be associated to ad- ditive or synergistic interactions among different eo constituents andor the presence of compounds effective even at low concen- trations delaquis and others 2002 gao and others 2011 sokovic' and others 2010. in addition m. luteus has shown sensitivity to a-pinene b-linalool terpinen-4-ol and carvacrol dorman and deans 2000 compounds identified in mexican oregano eo herna'ndez-herna'ndez and others 2014. based on these results mexican oregano eo was chosen as antimicrobial and antioxidant source instead of its major component thymol.effect of free nanoemulsified and microencapsulated eo against selected food spoilage microorganisms.

additionally nanometric particle size may have reduced evapo- ration of eo compounds during atomization soottitantawat and others 2005.figure 3-antioxidant capacity dpph assay of free feo nanoemulsified neo and microencapsulated meo mexican oregano eo thymol t buty- lated hydroxyanisole bha and gallic acid ga. different letters indicate difference p  0.05.antioxidant capacity of free nanoemulsified and microencapsulated eofeo showed strong radical-scavenging effect 93.53 - 0.18 similar to gallic acid and bha 95.57 - 0.08 and 96.03 - 0.31 respectively figure 3. this activity was significantly higher than that exhibited by thymol 89.92 - 0.38 which was used in a concentration equivalent to that in mexican eo 66.3 wv.

films permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide was determined according to porta and others 2016 and expressed as cm3m s pa.in vitro antimicrobial activity of eo and thymolantibacterial activity was tested using the agar disk diffusion method with m. luteus as positive control due to its high sensitiv- ity to oregano eo herna'ndez-herna'ndez and others 2014. ster- ile 25 mm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes millipore ma.

carvacrol and thymol showed the 1625 cm-1 band characteristic of the aromatic ring c-c stretching vibration and it was assumed to be thymol because carvacrol concentration in eo 0.1 vv herna'ndez-herna'ndez and oth- ers 2014 is below ft-raman detection limit siatis and others 2005.barrier propertiesfilms made from microencapsulated and nanoemulsified eo showed a wvp of 1.86 - 0.08 and 3.13 - 0.12 g mmm2 h kpa respectively.

infantis was more sensitive to feo than to meo and neo table 1. this pathogen has shown sensitivity to thymol and other compounds present in mexican eo dorman and deans 2000 sokovic' and others 2010. additionally oregano eo from other mexican regions showed activity against salmonella typhi herna'ndez and others 2009 mendez and others 2012 whereas no effect was detected against ps.

neo and meo showed lower scavenging activities 77.79 - 0.18 and 78.50 - 1.40 respectively p  0.05. the ability of eo to scavenge dpph radicals suggests that thymol a-terpineol and eugenol among other components might act as electron donors that react with free radicals converting them to more stable products brewer 2011.thymol phenolic group shows steric hindrance between iso- propyl and oh substituents that leads to high antioxidant capacity representing 96.14 of eo total scavenging ability figure 3.meat samples analysismicrobiological analysis.

furthermore neo and meo showed a significantly lower total count after 15 d than the other 18 treat- ments table 2. eo components showed an inhibitory effect thattable 2-effect of free feo nanoemulsified neo and microencapsulated meo mexican oregano eo edible coatings con- taining 8.55 mgeocm2 on fresh pork meat stored at 4 degc.

moreover secondary products from lipids oxidation might react with amino acid residues reducing proteins buffering capacity huff-lonergan and others 2010. additionally at 10 d of storage ut presented the highest ph values among the 20 treatments 6.30 - 0.02 while at 15 d ut and sc showed a similar trend table 3. samples with active coatings barely showed ph changes 5.50 - 0.01 5.60 - 0.01 and 5.54 - 0.08 for feoneo and meo respectively at the end of storage indicating the protective action of eo against decomposition andor substrate oxidation.initially meat coated with or without eo showed color changes p  0.05 table 3. however meat coated with feo neo and meo became significantly darker and reddish at the end of study due to decreasing l and hue values.

in relation to odor at the same time signif- icantly higher scores were revealed for neo and meo 6.9 whereas feo samples showed unacceptably stronger odor 5.9. at the end of storage period 15 d color and odor scores for ut and sc samples were undesirable 4.6 whereas feo neo and meo samples were acceptable score 6.3. therefore at the end of refrigerated storage the 3 formulations of eo meat coatings used in this work were acceptable for purchase opposite to ut samples.conclusionsthe 2 main components of eo were identified as thymol and g -terpinene.

in addition karago z-emirogvlu and others 2010 found that soy protein based films incorporated with thyme or oregano eo were effective against growth of staphylo- coccus aureus e. coli and e coli o157h7 on fresh ground beef during refrigerated storage.
