During S. Typhimurium Infection RegIIIb Kills BacteroidetesThis change in the microbiota composition leads to decreased levels of vitamin B6 delaying remission of disease.130 Cell Host  Microbe 21 February 8 2017 a 2017 Elsevier Inc.Cell Host  MicrobePreviewsthetaiotaomicron .

For example S. Typhimurium is an enteric pathogen that triggers inflammation which reprograms the metabolic and immunological environment of the gut thus facilitating S. Typhimurium expan- sion aEUR.The intestinal mucosa secretes a rangeof antimicrobial peptides into the gut lumen including the lectin RegIIIb which has bactericidal activity against certain types of bacteria .

Supplementa- tion of vitamin B6 also attenuated infec-tion and promoted recovery from the gut inflammation.The mechanism through which vitamin B6 affects the progression of S. Typhimu- rium infection is still unclear.

Similarly other vitamins have been found to pro- mote bacterial expansion or to modulate bacterial virulence and pathogen interac- tions with the host through modification of the host defense.

Vitamin A has protective effects against Listeria monocytogenes infection  and vitamin D3 alters the mucosal defense thus changing host susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium  .The new work from il- lustrates the intricate connection among the innate immune system microbiota composition and the intestinal metabo- lome and reveals how these multi-facto- rial relationships change the outcome of an enteric infection.

This three-way ''conversation'' among the host im- mune system the gut microbiota and pathogens is beginning to be unraveled in more mechanistic detail and the new work adds another layer involving vitamin B6 that impacts these interac- tions.

In this issue of Cell Host  Microbe show that RegIIIb impacts microbiota composition decreasing vitamin B6 production and promoting sustained colonization by Salmonella.The gut microbiota is largely responsible for the synthesis of vitamins and other metabolites that are key to mammalian health.

In theory it could act by promoting growth of Bacteroides by modulating the host immune system or by interfering with S. Typhimurium's growth or virulence expression.

For example vitamin B12 enhances expansion of Bacteroidesmurium infection RegIIIb enhanced mucosal inflammation by elevating theFigure 1.

The observation that supplementa- tion of Bacteroides or vitamin B6 to mice infected with S. Typhimurium accelerated remission opens novel avenues to com- bat infectious diseases by reprograming the microbiota to produce specific me- tabolites.
