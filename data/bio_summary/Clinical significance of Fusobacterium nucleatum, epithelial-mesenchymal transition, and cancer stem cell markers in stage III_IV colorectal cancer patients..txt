taken together these findings indicate that fn is a novel predictive biomarker for clinical management in stage iiiiv patients and targeting fn may be an effective adjuvant approach for preventing crc metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.keywords colorectal cancer fn emt cancer stem cell prognosisintroductioncolorectal cancer crc is a fatal digestive malignancy that is commonly diagnosed in both males and females worldwide.1 in usa it is the third most common form of cancer and will account for an estimated 135430 newly diagnosed cases and 50260 crc-specific deaths in 2017.2 in china its incidence has reached 37.63 per 100000 in 2015 according to the latest report.3 the pathogenesis of crc is a complicated multistep process involving various inherent and environmental factors such as genetic predisposition and unhealthy lifestyles.4 although dramatic reduction has been achieved in crc mortality because of the introduction of screening programs and multidis- ciplinary treatments 60 of crc patients are still diagnosed with advanced stage with their 5-year survival rate ranging from 14 to 71.5 in addition there are few effective therapeutical approaches and prognostic biomarkers available for metastaticsubmit your manuscript  oncotargets and therapy 201710 5031-50465031c 2017 yan et al.

since epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition emt and cancer stem cell csc are both widely considered as major molecular factors driving cancer development we also made efforts to detect the expression of representative emt and csc mark- ers in these patients and identify their potential correlations with fn.2021 taken together our findings not only suggest fn as a novel therapeutical target and prognostic biomarker for crc patients within late stage but also highlight the crucial link between dysregulated microbiota and oncogenic molecular events in crc progression.materials and methodspatient data and specimensa total of 280 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected from stage iiiiv crc patients who underwent radical surgery at department of general surgery shanghai jiao tong university affiliated sixth people's hospital and shanghai tenth people's hospital between october 1 2007 and september 25 2015. all the patients were pathologically confirmed as crc with positive lymph node metastasis lnm.

this further confirmed our previous finding that fn enhances the malignant characteristics of crc cells in vitro and in vivo.19 li et al proved that fn level is positively associated with the presence of lnm but not with tumor invasion in a relatively smaller cohort of crc patients n101 partly consistent with our present result.36 furthermore castellarin et al found that 74.4 2939of crc patients with high fn level had positive lnm as compared with 44.8 2658 of those with low fn level also indicating a close correlation between fn and lnm.30 therefore given these evidences we concluded that fn level might be a promising indicator for crc metastasis in crc patients especially for those with positive lnm.although fn level has been identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor in several studies its specific prognostic significance for stage iiiiv patients remains unknown.3738 using the kaplan-meier model our survival analysis showed that stage iiiiv patients with high fn level had a signifi- cantly worse css and dfs than those with low fn level.

yu et al have recently found that fn can induce chemotherapy resistance of crc cells through modulat- ing autophagy via toll-like receptormicrornas signaling cascade strongly supporting our results.46 furthermore it is reported that chemotherapy may in turn influence the gut bacteria of cancer patients.47 therefore whether the fn level is changed during chemotherapy treatment and this change has any impact on therapy efficacy or even drug toxicity is also worthy of further investigation.finally we analyzed the expression and clinical sig-nificance of emt and csc markers in stage iiiiv patients based on the consideration that both the molecular events play a major part in disease progression and therapy resistance of cancer patients.48 our results showed that these markers are correlated with not only some clinicopathological features but also css and dfs in stage iiiiv patients.

finally it should be noted that our study was unable to investigate the prognostic value of fecal fn level in crc patients although its diagnostic potential has been highly advocated in several previous studies.4344 hence whether its fecal level has any prognostic value or serves as a dynamic noninvasive marker like cea in crc surveillance still requires our extensive clinical validations in future.increasing evidences have supported that gut bacteria play a major role in modulating the anticancer efficacy ofvarious crc-related chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5-fu irinotecan and oxaliplatin.45 to identify the correlation between fn level and chemotherapy benefits in stage iiiiv patients a subgroup analysis was carried out based on fn level and we found that patients receiving chemotherapy had a significantly better prognosis than those receiving no chemotherapy in both the high and low fn level group.

we also speculate that this result is partly attributed to the survival paradox that stage iiia patients clinically characterized ast1-2n1-2am0 have a significantly better prognosis than otherstage iii and even most stage ii patients with a 5-year overall survival rate ranging from 81.6 to 85.6 as reported.4142 this abnormally favorable prognosis may contribute to the failed prognostic stratification of fn level in stage iiia patients and we therefore suggest that detecting the fn level in these patients may provide limited beneficial informa- tion for clinical management.

several studies have recently suggested the limitation of traditional lnm status in prognosis stratification of stage iii patients strongly urging us to investigate whether the fn level has the capacity to provide an accurate stratification for these patients.3940 we therefore subsequently performed a subgroup analysis and found that fn level could stratify the css and dfs of both stage iiib and iiic patients but failed in stage iiia patients.
