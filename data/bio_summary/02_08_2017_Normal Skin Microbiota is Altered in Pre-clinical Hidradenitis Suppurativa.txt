To the best of the author's knowledge the healthy microbiota in ax- illary skin has not previously been visualized by the use of CLSM and may therefore be used in other microbiome studies for comparison.Considering the fact that the intertriginous regions of the human skin and in particular the axilla offers highly favourable conditions for bacteria to proliferate 36 our observation of a reduced presence of bacterial aggrega- tes in axillary HS skin appears even more interesting.

In addition we did not visualize the extracellular matrix of the bacterial aggregates.We detected fewer bacteria and less biofilm indicatinga relative lack of skin microbiota in clinically unaffected axillary HS skin.

Only 3 samples were found positive for small bacterial aggregates.Quantification of bacterial aggregates in skin biopsies shown in a dot plot with median of 0 zero and of 2 for the HS patients and controls respectively.

Previous studies have furthermore been restricted to lesional skin without inclusion of healthy control groups and micro- biological investigations of clinically normal HS skin of the intertriginous regions are limited.The clinical course of HS is compatible with a biofilm- driven disease.

We did not obtain specific information on oral contraceptives among patients with HS or healthy controls.Biopsies and HE stainingPrior to injection of anaesthetics the skin was cleansed with etha- nol swabs FastCarer 70 Isopropyl Alcohol Zhejian China to reduce the number of surface microorganisms.Axillary skin was anesthetized using a 2 solution of lidocaine and adrenaline no preservatives.

However taking our recent findings into account the presence of biofilm found in lesional HS skin may thus primarily reflect se- condary colonization of biofilm-producing bacteria most likely due to rupture of the innate skin barrier.

Remarkably alterations in the composition of the skin microbiota dysbiosis has been shown in the context of other skin inflammatory disorders such as acne vulgaris psoriasis and atopic dermatitis 37.

Furthermore general investigations of the complex cross-talk between the resident microbiota and epithelial cytokines in the skin are needed to clarify the mechanisms that modulate skin immune homeostasis and subsequent inflammation.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors would like to thank The Lundbeck Foundation for financial support of Professor Thomas Bjarnsholt.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.REFERENCESJemec GB.

Thus the pathobiology of HS may elicit formations of bacterial aggregates biofilms in particular in anoxic cavities such as sinus tracts ordilated hair follicles.If biofilm plays a role in the aetiology of HS we hypothesized that clinically unaffected HS skin also would have an increased presence of bacteria and biofilm compared with that of healthy controls.
