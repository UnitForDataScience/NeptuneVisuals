The fecal microbiota and metabolome were assessed immediately prior to antibiotic treatment baseline or time 1 T1 after 14 days of antibiotic treatment during the course of antibiotic treatment T2 and 9 days following the termination of antibiotics recovery T3.

The fecal microbial community of mice was analyzed immediately before treatment baseline T1 and after 14 days of antibiotic treatment T2 as well as at 9 days after antibiotic treatment T3 to analyze for recovery from antibiotics.

Analysis of the distance to a group's centroid permuta- tional analysis of the homogeneity of group dispersions PERMDISP also revealed no significant difference in the levels of the homogeneity of dispersions of the microbial community between the control group and the ciprofloxacin t  1.245 permutation test P value Pperm  0.387 or vancomycin-imipenem t  1.451 Pperm  0.328 group at baseline .Within 14 days of antibiotic treatment the fecal microbial compositions between the control and antibiotic groups were significantly different Pperm  0.0001 square root estimated components of variation ECV  41.73 9951 permutations Table S1.

Vancomycin-imipenem also resulted in a significant difference in the fecal microbi- ota compositions t  10.43 Pperm  0.0003 5043 permutations and significantlyFIG 3 LEfSe comparison analysis between the control and ciprofloxacin or vancomycin-imipenem groups at the end of antibiotic treatment A or B respectively or 9 days after cessation of antibiotic treatment C or D respectively.

Such discrepancies between the microbiota and metabolome-level antibiotic effects are a further indication of functional redundancy in the intestinal microbiome the need to examine both composition and function in order to fully characterize the impacts of antibiotic therapy and the potential influence of antibiotics on host physiology.Our study had a number of limitations that must be taken into consideration.

One fecal pellet wastaken from each mouse at three time points T1 prior to commencement of antibiotic treatment T2 at termination of treatment after 14 days on antibiotics and T3 9 days after antibiotic treatment ceased.

The fecal-microbiota compositions of the control and antibiotic groups were visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling NMDS based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances of square root-transformed relative abundances  see also the compositional data shown in Fig.

The distance to the group's centroid was significantly reduced in the ciprofloxacin group compared to that for controls t  3.466 Pperm  0.003  suggesting that microbiota changes resulted from antibiotic selective pressure.
