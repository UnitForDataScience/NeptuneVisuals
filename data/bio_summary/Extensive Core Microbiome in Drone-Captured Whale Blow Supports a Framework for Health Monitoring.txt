the categories controls seawater and humpback blow were inferred based on the clustering patterns and sample types.iotas were 50 to 90 similar to each other the microbiotas of the blow samples collected off cape cod were nevertheless significantly different from those collected around vancouver island permanova f 5.8224 p  0.001 and neither finding was impacted by the factor of sequencing depth permanova with pairwise tests p 5004003002000.960.920.880.84whale or seawater sample identificationfig 3 diversity of whale blow and seawater samples from minimum entropy decomposition med node groupings  including observed number of meds a relative estimate of species richness between samples a and simpson's index  a relative estimate of diversity and evenness b. data from replicate collections are shown for the vancouver island blow and seawater samples with multiple symbols per sample name.0.05.

although two blow samples bcabmix and bcabunk from the same whale were more similar to the surface seawater than to the other humpback blow samples  seawater microorganisms may be incorporated into the blow hence these blow samples were included in all further analyses.

there was considerably more consistency between the numbers of observed meds within replicate samples in the seawater microbiome than for the vancouver island humpback whale blow samples the only blow samples that were replicated which could be related to inconsistencies in whale blows volume of blow collection or sequencing depth .

exhaled breath condensate blow was collected from humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae in the race point channel north of cape cod ma n 17 during july 2015 and in two locations around vancouver island johnstone strait and surrounding channels british columbia n 6 whales with replicate samples for all animals in august 2016 and off san juan island washington state n 3 whales with replicate samples for 2 animals in september 2016. samples were collected using a small unmanned hexacopter drone aph-22 aerial imaging solutions old lyme ct operated by a pilot and copilot team from a vessel  .

partialbacterial and archaeal ssu rrna genes were amplified from dna extractions of the blow samples including replicate blows from eight animals environmental controls a nonblow flight and nine replicate surface seawater samples from around vancouver island sampling equipment was not available for cape cod seawater and technical controls dna extraction of sterile swabs and pcr blanks and sequenced resulting infig 1 a photograph of the aph-22 hexacopter launching for flight with a petri dish atop and a 96-well pcr plate attached on a forward arm for whale blow sampling.

a cluster dendrogram analysis of bray-curtis dissimilarity  of the meds showed that community compositions of the technical control samples were similar to each other but different from the majority of blow samples .

five sparse-volume volume observed in the field blow samples waaf06 hca haa hk and hbb clustered with the technical controls indicating that the volume of these samples likely was so low that they only reflected the background microbial signal of technical contaminants such as laboratory reagents.

the simpson index was comparable for blow and seawater samples from vancouver island but was more variable for the cape cod blow samples .a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of sequences that spanned 15 phyla of bacteria and two phyla of archaea was identified in the humpback whale blow microbiomes.

to identify samples that might be suitable for respiratory pathogen screening the taxonomy of the blow meds was screened at the level of genus against a custom pathogen database20homology with sequences from marine mammals homology with sequences from terrestrial mammals homology with sequences from seawater151050actinobacteriabacteroidetesfirmicutesgammaproteobacteriaalphaproteofig 5 box plots displaying the median minimum maximum and first and third quartiles of the percentage of the 25 members of the core microbiome detected in all humpback whale blow samples obtained from minimum entropy decomposition  nodes of bacterial and archaeal ssu rrna genes.

thus in addition to seawater-associated microbes a mixture of pulmonary bacteria and mi- crobes associated with the epithelial cells of the blowholes likely comprise the blow microbiome in cetaceans.the second and possibly most useful feature of the humpback whale blow micro- biome for health monitoring is that it contains a surprisingly high number of core microbiome members shared by all individuals despite our samples being collectedarthrobacter corynebacteriumsphingomonas bacillus lactobacilluslactococcus listeria staphylococcusstreptococcusbacteroides porphyromonasneisseria helcococcusabundancepeptostreptococcusarcobacter1.00campylobacterhelicobacter capnocytophaga chryseobacterium fusobacterium acinetobacter0.01actinobacillus balneatrix escherichia-shigella haemophilusmoraxella pseudoalteromonas pseudomonaspsychrobactervibrio mycoplasmaveillonellacape cod whale blowvancouver island whale blowvancouver island seawaterfig 6 heat map of the distribution and relative abundance of the minimum entropy decomposition nodes meds  obtained from bacterial and archaeal ssu rrna genes from humpback whale blow and surface seawater samples that are related to potential pathogens.

indeed several low-volume samples collected from this study were found to be similar in composition to samples from flight and technical controls.

contaminating dna is frequently identified in low-volume samples   including those targeting low microbial biomass from human lungs  and the present study suggests that flight and technical controls are necessary to ensure that biological samples have sufficient volume and microbial biomass for accurate comparisons.

sampled whales were photographed for identification purposes using standard methods to identify duplicate samples from the same whale .as a control the hexacopter was flown with sterile pcr plates attached for the same flight duration altitude over the water and distance from the boat as had been done when collecting actual blow samples.

barcoded 515fy and 806rb   primers utilized by the earth microbiome project were used to amplify the v4 region of the ssu rrna gene in triplicate 25-ul pcr mixtures per sample on a bio-rad thermocycler hercules ca as follows an initial denaturation step at 95degc for 2 min 30 to 38 cycles blow samples or 20 to 25 cycles seawater samples of 95degc for 20 s 55degc for 15 s and 72degc for 5 min and an extension step at 72degc for 10 min.

however due to the low-volume nature of the blow samples these samples were initially included in the analysis .
