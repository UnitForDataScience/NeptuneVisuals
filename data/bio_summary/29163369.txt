In female offspring at weaning there was a significant difference p  0.018 in Enterobacteriaceae with offspring of Obese-HFS dams havinghigher levels 1.22 - 0.49 relative abundance compared with allother groups Obese-OFS 0.120 - 05 Obese-S 0.020 - 01Obese-OFS  S 0.20 - 0.09 Obese-HFS 0.26 - 0.06 andLean-Control 0.45 - 0.15.At 11 and 17 weeks of age in male offspring there was a sig- nificant effect of time p  0.01 for BacteroidesPrevotella spp.

The rats withthe highest weight gain were then randomized into one of four intervention groups for 8 weeks with AIN-93 control background diet 1 Obese-Control obese rats consuming control diet during intervention 2 Obese-OFS obese rats consuming 10 OFS diet during intervention 3 Obese-S obese rats treated with sitagliptin drug during the intervention and 4 Obese-OFS  S obese rats treated with combination treatment.

At the end of the 8-week intervention the rats all 32 weeks of age were bred with male Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from the University ofCalgary Life and Environmental Science Animal Resource Centre Calgary AB USA and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of a copulation plug.Dams in the Obese-HFS group n  12 continued on the HFS diet throughout pregnancy and lactation while all other dams were fed a control AIN-93G diet.

Although not significant none of the Obese-HFS dams had a normal litter and across all treatments Obese-HFS dams had the greatest number of adverse outcomes .Maternal gut Microbiota at BirthMaternal gut microbiota composition at birth showed a significant treatment effect for Clostridium cluster XI p  0.0001 wherein abundance was significantly higher in Obese-HFS and Obese-S dams compared with all other groups p  0.02 .

At 17 weeks however female offspring of Obese-OFS and Obese-S dams had significantly lower fasting blood glucose compared with Obese-HFS and Obese-Control offspring p  0.05.

p  0.031 wherein male offspring of Obese-HFS dams had lower relative abundance than offspring from Lean-Control at 11 weeks of age.

No statistically significant differences exist between maternal treatment groups p  0.05.TaBle 3  Percentage of pregnancies with normal small or adverse litters in dams treated with OFS S both or neither.Values are presented as mean percentage of all pregnancies resulting in normal small or adverse litter status n  9 for Obese-OFS and Obese-OFS  S n  10 for Lean-Control and Obese-Control n  11 for Obese-HFS and Obese-S.HFS high fatsucrose OFS oligofructose S sitagliptin.Obese in the group name indicates diet-induced obese rats that underwent the respective prepregnancy interventions except Obese-HFS that remained untreated and consumed HFS diet throughout the study.

Modest weight loss induced with a diet- drug combination did not affect maternal fecundity but did have sex-specific effects on offspring adiposity and glycemia that may be linked to changes in offspring microbiota.Keywords oligofructose dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor maternal obesity prepregnancy gut microbiota maternal prinTrODUcTiOnOver the past 30 years worldwide obesity has nearly doubled .

Roseburia was also affected by the interaction of time and treatment p  0.025 wherein male offspring of Lean- Control had significantly higher abundance than Obese-OFS  S at 11 weeks and by 17 weeks of age Lean-Control was higher than Obese-OFS Obese-S and Obese-OFS  S.In female offspring there was a significant effect of timep  0.024 for Bifidobacterium spp.

While dietary intervention with OFS during pregnancy and lactation has previ- ously been shown to alter maternal gut microbiota substantially   intervening before pregnancy with OFS or sitagliptin did not have any lasting effects that could be detected at birth beyond increased C. cluster I and XI in Obese-S dams which mimicked Obese-HFS dams.
