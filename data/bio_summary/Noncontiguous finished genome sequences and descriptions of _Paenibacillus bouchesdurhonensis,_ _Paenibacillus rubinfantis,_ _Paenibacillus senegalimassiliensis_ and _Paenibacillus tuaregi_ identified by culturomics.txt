the resulting score allowed us to identify or not the tested species samples were labeled as correctly identified at the species level with a score of 22 they permitted identification at the genus level with a score of 21.7 but 2 and samples provided no identification with a score of 1.7. no significant score was obtained for our strains thus suggesting that our isolated species were not members of a known species.consequently identification of these strains was realized by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing.

we therefore suggest that our strain is a representative strain of a new species within the genus paenibacillus for which we suggest the name 'paenibacillus tuaregi' strain marseille-p2472t  csur p2472  dsm 102801.the analysis of the gel view  shows that all the profiles of our studied strains have similar general characteristics withthe other paenibacillus species used for the comparison.

s1.mt18t 'paenibacillus senegalimassiliensis' strain sit18t and 'paenibacillus tuaregi' strain marseille-p2472t to other species within genus paenibacillus was realized.

a similarity threshold of 98.7 allowed identification at the species level new species whereas a threshold of 95 allowed identifi- cation at the genus level new genus .

all species from the same family of the new species were automatically retrieved by using a custom python script which was able to download 16s rrna gene sequences from the national center for biotech- nology information ncbi then separate 16s rrna gene se- quences in two groups group a containing the sequences of strains from the same genus and group b containing the rest.

compare data of our four new species to published data of closely related species pae- nibacillus lentus strain gmg 12401  paenibacillus telluris strain p538  paenibacillus barengoltzii strain safn 016 and paenibacillus sanguinis strain 2301083 .fatty acid methyl esters were prepared as described by sasser .
