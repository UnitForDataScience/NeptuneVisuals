Specifically it can be shown that once the learning cell is activated by the sim- ultaneous presence of X and Y the communication moleculeA will remain auto-activated and always produced in the learning phase C. An additional example b is pro- vided by another learning circuit.

Transition table for the simplified Boolean circuit implementing 2 the two-cell circuit shown in c. The different input pair values given in the two left columns provide the sequence of states X and Y for the conditional and unconditional inputs introduced to test the presence of AL assuming that G1 14 0 and G2 14 1 at the beginning.multicellular circuit.

Here X can activate the response R whereas Y will do it when X 14 0 only if an intermediate module M that needs to be previously activated by X th Y has the right expression level.

Both cells have X and Y as inputs but the nature of their responses is markedly different.d12TetR 14 gTetR - dTetR12TetRd310Thwhich provide the gene products that will interact with X andY within this cell under the nonlinear equations3.1.

The sequence of states associate with the consortium displayed in c is shown in 1 where the set of possible input pairs X Y and the G1 G2 the states of the elements defining the memory switch see 1.Associative learning in a synthetic microbial consortiumIn order to avoid undesirable effects derived from complex constructs cellular consortia where different parts of the computation are split into different engineered cells can be used as an alternative to single-cell designs.

C AL region yellow the learning cell change the state of the toggle switch after the simultaneous stimulation with X and Y signals then the system has learned.

B Damped learning there is a characteristic time where the two cell system responds to X and Y afterwards the system does not respond to the unconditioned signal.

B Damped learning the learning cell has a temporal association turquoise the producer cells only respond to the conditioned signal for a limited time after the conditioning.
