Specifically it can be shown that once the learning cell is activated by the sim- ultaneous presence of X and Y the communication moleculeA will remain auto-activated and always produced in the learning phase C. An additional example b is pro- vided by another learning circuit.

B Damped learning the learning cell has a temporal association turquoise the producer cells only respond to the conditioned signal for a limited time after the conditioning.

This is an interesting possibility given the feedback existing between both the immune system and the brain as connected with the microbiome  Because both immune and brain net- works are capable of displaying learning and memory microbial consortia such as the ones presented here could act as extensions of neural-like decision circuits.Finally another interesting possibility concerns the design 9 of synthetic learning circuits along with other computatio- nal structures that could be incorporated within organoids .

Next a potential implementation using a computational model for E. coli will be described.The logic of multicellular learningA synthetic circuit capable of AL requires modulation of the internal states through the learning process.

This defines the basic logic of our implementation but we have split the circuit in two parts c corresponding to a producer cell C1 carrying the toggle switch and a learning cell C2 that is wired to C1 through a molecular wire A.

The plot has been created on a log-log scale and thus we can see that a broad range of parameters are consistent with this behaviour.Suppressing associative learningOnce the association has been established in our circuit as it occurs with conditioned learning in animals the switch is locked in a given state that allows the association to be stable over time.

Because the circuit responds to one signal US but not the other CS unless they have been previously presented together this indicates that the internal states of the underlying molecular circuit must have changed see 1.
