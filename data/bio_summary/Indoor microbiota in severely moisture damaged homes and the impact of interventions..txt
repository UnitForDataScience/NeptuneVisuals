Notably the severity of bacterial and fungal growth in the study homes--determined as viable microbial counts from building material samples--was linked to the bacterial and fungal microbiota in house dust Table That is those homes that had different levels of microbial growth on building materials high mediumlow tended to have different microbial com- munity composition although the data do show noise around this trend Additional file Figure S2.The impact of moisture damage interventions on house dust microbiotaWe followed 20 homesfamilies through moisture damage interventions which in nine homes involved remediation of the moisture damages in the course of renovations andin the case of 11 homes families moved Table .

In other studies higher fungal but not bacterial richness has been reported for homes where water leaks had been observed compared to homes without such observations Taken together these findings suggest that the fungal and bacterial microbiota in house dust of moisture- damaged homes are not marked by a common and striking shift relative to dry homes but rather may ex- perience more subtle changes in some of the less- abundant taxa.Table 5 Fungal taxa associated with moisture damage renovations as identified via PCoA approach LefSe and glm-edgeR and confirmed in pairwise sample comparison pre and post moisture damage renovations p  0.05 in Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

In our current study we aimed to i characterize fungal and bacterial microbiota in the house dust of severely moisture-damaged residential homesii identify microbial signatures of moisture damage by following homes through moisture damage renovations and iii test whether the associations of the identified taxa with moisture damage are replicable in a large co- hort of residential homes with varying degrees of ob- served moisture damage and visible mold.MethodsStudy populationThe HOTES study HOmeloukku ja TErveysSeuran- ta--moldy homes and health study was conducted in severely moisture-damaged homes across Finland and among their occupants.

Of these 41 homes a total of 20 homes were also examined post- interventions with exposure and health assessments conducted the same way as pre-intervention and paired pre and post house dust samples were used for the current analyses Table Homes that underwent an intervention compared to homes that did not had more occupants and higher number of toxins detectable from house dust no significant differences were observed for the other key environmental and microbial variables levels of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria total fungi and FERMI index and viable bacteria and fungi de- tected from building material samples prevalence of petTable 1 Study populations used in the analyses numbers of homes and number of samplesmaterials has been described elsewhere Jarvi et al.

We studied associations of the bacterial and fungal taxa that were identified in the HOTES study with three-level moisture damage and vis- ible mold variables in the LUKAS homes.Nine of the 25 bacterial OTUs identified in HOTES Table were not found in the LUKAS house dust data- set eight OTUs showed tendencies p value  0.1 for an increase in relative abundance in house dust of homes with more severe moisture andor mold damage Additional file Table S16.

The categorization of homes based on fungal and bacterial colony counts from buildingHouse dust sampling for microbial determinationsHouse dust samples representing integrated exposure over time were collected with protocols developed and applied in previous studies Floor dust sample was obtained by attaching a nylon sample sock to a vacuum cleaner's pipe and by vacuuming a floor area preferably rugs of 5 m2 for 10 min in the living room FDLR.

Future studies should consider coupling house dust investigations with sequencing of moisture-damaged materials in the respective buildings which could facilitate a more thorough search for indicator taxa.In a replication study utilizing house dust samples of over 400 Finnish homes that have been thoroughly inspected for observations of moisture damage and visible mold two of the bacterial and one of the fun- gal potential indicator taxa were found to be associ- ated significantly with severity of the dampness observations in these homes.

The sequences for the OTUs were obtained from the Greengenes database and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor joining algorithm within the MEGA7 software Replication study in the LUKAS cohortDetails on the LUKAS cohort the dust sampling and sample processing sequencing and sequence processing are provided in the Supplement Additional file In brief the LUKAS study is a birth cohort that consists of 442 single family homes in eastern and middle Finland with approximately one fourth of the homes being farm- ing homes Floor dust sampling and standardizedhome inspections were performed in early life of the participating study children providing classification on moisture damage no minor major and visible mold no mold spots visible mold for the current analyses.

Categorized groups of total fungal and bacterial biomass determined with qPCR and number of different microbial secondary metabolites determined with LC-MSMS did not have significant impact on either bacterial or fungal commu- nities Table However the Finnish Relative Moldiness Index correlated significantly with the bacterial and borderline significantly with the fungal microbiota in floor dust.

We applied bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing complemented with quantitative PCR and chemical-analytical approaches to samples of house dust and also performed traditional cultivation of bacteria and fungi from building material samples.Results Active microbial growth on building materials had significant though small influence on the house dust bacterial and fungal communities.
