notably the severity of bacterial and fungal growth in the study homes--determined as viable microbial counts from building material samples--was linked to the bacterial and fungal microbiota in house dust table that is those homes that had different levels of microbial growth on building materials high mediumlow tended to have different microbial com- munity composition although the data do show noise around this trend additional file figure s2.the impact of moisture damage interventions on house dust microbiotawe followed 20 homesfamilies through moisture damage interventions which in nine homes involved remediation of the moisture damages in the course of renovations andin the case of 11 homes families moved table .

in other studies higher fungal but not bacterial richness has been reported for homes where water leaks had been observed compared to homes without such observations taken together these findings suggest that the fungal and bacterial microbiota in house dust of moisture- damaged homes are not marked by a common and striking shift relative to dry homes but rather may ex- perience more subtle changes in some of the less- abundant taxa.table 5 fungal taxa associated with moisture damage renovations as identified via pcoa approach lefse and glm-edger and confirmed in pairwise sample comparison pre and post moisture damage renovations p  0.05 in wilcoxon signed-rank test.

in our current study we aimed to i characterize fungal and bacterial microbiota in the house dust of severely moisture-damaged residential homesii identify microbial signatures of moisture damage by following homes through moisture damage renovations and iii test whether the associations of the identified taxa with moisture damage are replicable in a large co- hort of residential homes with varying degrees of ob- served moisture damage and visible mold.methodsstudy populationthe hotes study homeloukku ja terveysseuran- ta--moldy homes and health study was conducted in severely moisture-damaged homes across finland and among their occupants.

testing the potential usefulness of these taxa for indicating moisture problems in buildings in another larger study we find dose-response relationships in a number of taxa.table 4 bacterial taxa associated with moisture damage renovations as determined via pcoa approach lefse and glm-edger presented are otus that were detected with at least two of the three approaches arrows indicate decrease or increase in relative abundance during moisture damage renovationsastatistically significant difference p  0.05 wilcoxon signed-rank test in house dust pre versus post moisture damage renovation in pairwise sample comparison n  20  20bstatistically significant difference p  0.05 wilcoxon signed-rank test in house dust samples pre versus post moving into a new home pairwise samplecomparison n  21  21one of the key findings of our current study is that moisture damage interventions neither appear to be linked to major changes in the most abundant bacterial and fungal taxa in house dust nor to major changes in the overall community structure.

we studied associations of the bacterial and fungal taxa that were identified in the hotes study with three-level moisture damage and vis- ible mold variables in the lukas homes.nine of the 25 bacterial otus identified in hotes table were not found in the lukas house dust data- set eight otus showed tendencies p value  0.1 for an increase in relative abundance in house dust of homes with more severe moisture andor mold damage additional file table s16.

future studies should consider coupling house dust investigations with sequencing of moisture-damaged materials in the respective buildings which could facilitate a more thorough search for indicator taxa.in a replication study utilizing house dust samples of over 400 finnish homes that have been thoroughly inspected for observations of moisture damage and visible mold two of the bacterial and one of the fun- gal potential indicator taxa were found to be associ- ated significantly with severity of the dampness observations in these homes.

the sequences for the otus were obtained from the greengenes database and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining algorithm within the mega7 software replication study in the lukas cohortdetails on the lukas cohort the dust sampling and sample processing sequencing and sequence processing are provided in the supplement additional file in brief the lukas study is a birth cohort that consists of 442 single family homes in eastern and middle finland with approximately one fourth of the homes being farm- ing homes floor dust sampling and standardizedhome inspections were performed in early life of the participating study children providing classification on moisture damage no minor major and visible mold no mold spots visible mold for the current analyses.

we applied bacterial 16s rrna gene and fungal its amplicon sequencing complemented with quantitative pcr and chemical-analytical approaches to samples of house dust and also performed traditional cultivation of bacteria and fungi from building material samples.results active microbial growth on building materials had significant though small influence on the house dust bacterial and fungal communities.

bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity estimates chao1 estimates richness shannon index were not significantly different between the different sample types additional file table s3.we evaluated associations of environmental variables and other microbial measurements on the beta-diversity of bacterial and fungal microbiota in house dust of moisture-damaged homes.

we monitored the impact of the interventions in pre versus post comparisons in these 20 homes in terms of the num- bers and types of bacterial and fungal taxa in order to in- vestigate how interventions changed potential microbial exposures.in pairwise sample comparisons pre versus post inter- ventions of the relative abundance of the 15 top most abundant bacterial and fungal genera in the house dust samples we found little significant changes fig.

it is obvious that fixing all moisture damage in buildings im- mediately is an impossible task given the estimates of 10 to 50 of the existing building stock being affected by some level of moisture damage tools thattable 6 replication study in the lukas cohort bacterial otus and fungal taxa identified in the hotes study with significant differences p  0.05 kruskal-wallis test after bonferroni correction in relative abundance in house dust of homes categorized by moisture damage severity and extent of visible mold in the lukas cohort 75th pctl 75th percentile moisture damage 0 ... no moisture damage 1 ... minor moisture damage 2 ... major moisture damage visible mold 0 ... no visible mold 1 ... spots of visible mold 2 ... visible mold n number of homesmoisture damagevisible moldtaxonomyrelative abundancerelative abundanceotu id familygenusspeciesnmedian75th pctlp valuenmedian75th pctlp value bacterial otussignificant p-values 0.05 are shown in italicswould separate severe--as in more health hazardous--- from less-severe moisture damage would allow prioritizing remediation efforts.
