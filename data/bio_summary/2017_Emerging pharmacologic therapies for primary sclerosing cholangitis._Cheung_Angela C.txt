This study of Mdr2-- mice demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of apical sodium bile acid transporter ASBT results in a reduction of bile acid secretion ALP aspartate aminotransferase hepatic expression of proinflammatory and profibrogenic markers leading to decreased histologic evidence of bile duct injury and fibrosis.

Also we need the capability to identify patients with rapidly progressive disease and preferentially enroll these patients into clinical trials.Lessons from ursodeoxycholic acid studiesAlthough originally administration of exogenous bile acid therapy was postulated to replace toxic endogenous bile with a more nontoxic form i.e.

Differential expression of cholangiocyte and ileal bile acid transporters following bile acid supplementation and depletion.

Hypercholeresis induced by unconjugated bile acid infusion correlates with recovery in bile of unconjugated bile acids.

As a weak acid unconjugated norUDCA can be passively absorbed by cholangiocytes and secreted by hepatocytes unlike UDCA which in its unconjugated form can only be absorbed through the apical sodium bile acid transporter ASBT 31.

Kinetics of hepatic bile acid handling in cholestatic liver disease effect of ursodeoxycholic acid.

It has negligible effects on the synthesis of bile acids 17.Despite numerous studies on the utility of the synthetic bile acid UDCA in PSC its use remains highly controversial 1819.

Larger placebo-controlled studies are warranted.Apical sodium bile acid transporter inhibitorsBile acids undergo enterohepatic circulation with reabsorption of more than 95 of bile acids occurring at the terminal ileum via ASBT in the brush border membrane 49.
