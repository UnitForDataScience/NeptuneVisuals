this activation mechanism is a variation on the tcr- and cytokine-mediated mode of nkt cell activation and a feature that is important for nkt cell activation by microbes that do not themselves biosynthesise an nkt cell agonist.type i interferon ifn--produced by dcs activated by the tlr9 ligand cpg--can serve as a second signal for nkt cell activation in conjunction with the presentation of sialylated cellular glycolipids by cd1d molecules .

the inability to activate nkt cell hybridomas by using artificial apcs lacking bglccer synthase  and impaired nkt cell development in mice lacking bglccer synthase in their thymocytes  sug- gested that a cellular bglccer-derived gsl is an endogenous mouse nkt cell agonist  .

these nkt cell subsets marked by the same subset-specific transcription factors and cell surface markers expressed by the corresponding t helper cell subsets -.gene regulatory networks grns are composed of trans- regulatory factors--generally made up of transcription factors and regulatory rna such as micrornas and long non-coding rna--and cis-regulatory regions generally found upstream ofgenes whereupon transcription factors bind to control lineage- specific gene expression.

nkt1 cell differentiation depends on t-bet tbx21 and il-15 but less on gata3    -.unlike hdac3 depletion in dp thymocytes nkt cell lineage- specific deletion of hdac3 derived with the use if zbtb-cre results in selective impairment in nkt1 cell development.

another study using somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate mice with mono- clonal nkt cell populations demonstrated that tissue homing pattern and to a lesser extent tcr avidity governed nkt cell subset differentiation .

in an effort to understand whether genetic polymor- phisms between mouse strains controlled nkt cell frequency recombinant inbred and co-isogenic strains begotten from nod low nkt cell frequency x c57bl10 intermediate nkt cell frequency crosses were analyzed.

whereas this outcome suggests that nkt cell frequency is under genetic control whether this control is direct or indirect remains to be ascertained.developmental symbiosis gut microbiota-dependent peripheral nkt cell frequency and nkt cell control over gut microbiotankt cells surveil barrier mucosae such as that of the small and large intestine  .

summarily such areas include a what early events specify nkt cell lineage commitment and turn on the unique lineage-specific grn b what signals do symbionts relay to developing nkt cells to specify physiologic functionsc in turn what signals do nkt cells relay to the microbial community in the gut and potentially to the microbionts in skin and lungs to ensure physiologic community assembly structure and organization in early young and adult life d what tissue environmental signals underlie nkt cell subset differentiatione can radiation resistance of nkt cells be used in cancer immu- notherapy and f what nkt cell intrinsic and environmental signals have retained nkt cells in certain mammalian species but not in othersas a final note to the devo-eco-evo synthesis we observed that the unique behavior of a group of innate-like t lympho- cytes and innate lymphoid cells ilcs are under the control of plzf -.

by contrast the slow-responding adaptive immune system senses alterations in homeostasis by using diverse clonally distributed b cell receptors bcr and their secreted counterparts antibodies and t cell receptors tcrs respectively.bridging the gap between innate and adaptive immune responses are the innate-like b and t lymphocytes.

hence agalcer and related compounds may be more prevalent in nature than previ- ously thought and the nkt cell biology so gleaned may be highly relevant.agalcer is a potent nkt cell agonist which when presented by cd1d molecules directly activates nkt cells in a tcr-dependent manner without need for additional signals.

this activation mechanism is considered tcr- and cytokine-mediated mode of nkt cell activation --a feature that is important for nkt cell activation by weak microbial and self-lipid agonists.nkt cells react to cd1d molecules presenting self-lipids on host apcs in the presence of a second signal  .

as self-lipids are weak nkt cell agonists nkt cell activation is bolstered by il-12 secreted by dcs activated through dectin-1 dcs   or toll-like receptor tlr-4  .
