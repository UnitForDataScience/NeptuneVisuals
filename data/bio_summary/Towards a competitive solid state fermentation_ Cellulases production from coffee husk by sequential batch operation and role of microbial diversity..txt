However in this case the main goal was to extract the maximum cellulase activity and thus these percentages of degradation are acceptable.Lack of standardized cellulase activity determination makes difficult to provide a proper comparison with reported results.

As previously discussed the maxi- mum cellulase activity coincided with the maximum sOUR when using compost as inoculum.According to sOUR profiles a reduction in lag phase was accom- plished and global biological activity was higher with the specialized biomass obtained at the end of the sequential operation fermentation final batches compared to the first batch using compost as inoculum.

Similar results were observed in batch experiments performed in 4.5 L bioreactors where a process time of 48 h was fixed for maximum sOUR and cellulase production.Sequential batch operationThe operation of bioreactors working under SB90 and SB50 condi- tions is presented in respectively.

In summary the proposed process presents the following economic advantages the use of organic wastes instead of pure sub- strates saving the investment and the operating costs related to steril- ization saving the costs of producing inoculum for each batch since fermented solids from one batch are re-used to inoculate the following batch the potential use of the multienzymatic extracts without addi- tional purification steps.

However cellulase activity obtained in this work is located in therange of reported researches between 1 and 25 FPU g-1 DM for small bioreactors under sterile and mesophilic conditions  .As it can be observed in  similar final cellulase yields were obtained for both strategies.

Further re- search will focus on the improvement of cellulase production the process scale-up and the optimization of cellulase extraction by com- paring different downstream processing strategies.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at .AcknowledgmentsThis research has been funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad project CTM2015-69513-R.

These facts suggest the possibility to adapt a complex inoculum to de- grade lignocellulosic materials in an easily scalable process to provide a standardized cellulase production process.

The remaining su- pernatant was used for cellulases activity determination  .Enzymatic activityThe cellulase activity was measured according to the IUPAC filter paper assay .

In this figure it can be ob- served that the maximum cellulase activity was detected during the most active biooxidative stage of the process as other authors have also stated .
