with such in- testinal venous blood stream it has been proposed that the liver has to serve as a firewall to capture bacteria or their products that breach the intestine.4445 this may also be a mean by which aber- rant microbiota promote non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld.46 hence it is clear that an altered intestinal microbiota can impact the inflammatory state of distant organs and thus may play an important role in transplantation.3  the intestinal microbiota an important player in transplantation outcomes based on the central role played by the intestinal microbiota on im- mune cells composition diet-mediated dysbiosis can impact graft outcome and alloimmunity in various ways.

the intestinal microbiota has an overall beneficial impact to its host as demonstrated in germ-free mice where the lack of a mi- crobiota induces considerable immune and metabolic defects.1 on the other hand the observation that most mouse models of intestinalabbreviations apc antigen presenting cell cmc carboxymethylcellulose dss dextran sul- fate sodium gvhd graft versus host disease ibd inflammatory bowel disease lps lipo- polysaccharide m-shime mucosal simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem nafld non-alcoholic fatty liver disease p80 polysorbate 80 scfa short-chain fatty acid sfb segmented filamentous bacteria spf specific pathogen free tlr toll-like receptor.inflammation require a gut microbiota and that its composition is a key determinant of disease indicate that the microbiota can also dramat- ically regulate inflammatory processes and disease outcomes in the host.

moreover while the role of the intestinal microbiota in driving intestinal inflammation is well established recent studies highlighted that bacterial products can also drive low-grade inflammation and associated metabolic syndrome.

for example the soluble fiber inulin has been observed to favor the growth of bene- ficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii39 to induce short-chain fatty acid scfa40 and mucus pro- duction41 and was associated with a protection against low-grade intestinal inflammation.42 however while such types of soluble fiber beneficially impacts the intestinal microbiota and immune system we also recently observed that they have the potential to exacerbate dis- ease severity in response to dextran sulfate sodium dss43 highlight- ing that recommendations for food supplementation should be taken with a degree of caution.hence the gut microbiota plays a central role in maintaining health but this complex microbial community must be well con- trolled in order to protect the host from this potentially highly pro- inflammatory biomass.

while these data are of great interest since there are demonstrating that microbiota composition can be used as a di- agnostic biomarker of rejection it still remains unknown if intestinal microbiota composition in recipients andor donors can predict future response to transplantation.with post-transplantation complications being influenced by the host immune system the intestinal microbiota and its effects on this immune system may play a role in such process.

some approaches have been used in order to modulatethe intestinal microbiota in the context of transplantation such as with antibiotics prebiotics and probiotics and the efficacy of such inter- vention need further investigation.56 in an elegant study lei et al.57 recently investigated the role played by the intestinal microbiota as an environmental factor influencing transplant rejection.
