a large study on over 260 000 individuals reported an association between infection and increased odds of obesity in childhood and adolescence which was independent of antibiotic treatment94 table 2. further the odds of obesity were also higher in the group with untreated infections than among those who were both uninfected and untreated table 2. a limitation in that study was that the assessment of obesity was made by comparing bmi among children across a wide age range from 2 to 18 years and comparisons between children of similar age might have yielded different results.if infection is said to cause obesity should we also consider vi- ruses and other pathogenic organisms apart from bacteria as causative agents for obesity this concept infectobesity is not new and has been studied in animal models for the past 2 decades.97 at least ten different viruses have been reported to cause obesity in animals in- cluding canine distemper virus smam-1 avian adenovirus and human adenoviruses ad36 and ad37.98 further smam-1 and ad36 in par- ticular have been found to be associated with obesity in humans.9798 however beyond associations the role of these viruses in the devel- opment of obesity in humans remains unclear.7  conclusion there are strong data supporting the role of antibiotics in the devel- opment of obesity in well-controlled animal models but evidence in humans remains inconclusive.

the mechanisms by which antibiotics modulate weight gain are unclear but several hypotheses have been proposed472 which include the following i increased ability from gut bacteria to extract energy from indigestible polysaccharidesreduction in the number of bacteria that are metabolically protective against obesity iii altered hepatic lipogenesis iv altered metabolic signalling and v reduction in intestinal defence and immunity.since the 1950s antibiotics have been added to food and water in pigs cows and chickens as an effective method to enhance growth especially weight gain.73 this practice has been widely adopted by farmers and a number of different antibiotics have been used for this purpose.74-76 notably early-life exposure to antibiotics in these ani- mals has far greater effects on weight gain and feed efficiency than if exposure occurred in later life.74not surprisingly evidence from animal models has shown a direct link between treatment with low doses of antibiotics and changes in body composition.1577 in 2012 cho et al77 demonstrated that admin- istration of subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics increased adiposity in young mice and also altered the intestinal microbiome table 2. two years later cox et al15 observed that there was a critical period around the time of birth when mice were particularly vulnerable to low-dose antibiotic exposure table 2. male mice whose mother were treatedwith penicillin before birth and throughout weaning exhibited mark- edly increased total mass and fat mass.15 in contrast both male mice receiving antibiotics after weaning and female mice receiving antibiot- ics before birth and after weaning had similar body composition when compared with controls15 table 2. the authors also reported that low doses of antibiotics enhanced the effects of a high-fat diet on the de- velopment of obesity in these mice.15 additionally the study examined possible obesogenic effects of antibiotic-induced alterations in the gut microbiome.

nonetheless an interventional study by mikkelsen et al81 demonstrated that treating 12 lean and healthy male subjects for 4 days with a combination of vancomycin gentamicin and meropenem reduced the gut bacterial population but was not associated with changes in postprandial glucose tolerance in- sulin secretion or plasma lipid concentrations table 2. there was also a slight increase in body weight of 1.3 kg and an acute but reversible increase in peptide yy secretion81 table 2. these effects might not be as pronounced compared with those of a longer antibiotic therapy but a limitation of this study was the lack of a control placebo group.in children the evidence linking antibiotics usage to development of obesity has been inconsistent table 2. prophylactic antibiotic treatment in children with cystic fibrosis was shown to result in weight gain82 table 2. data from 10 randomized controlled trials indicated that antibiotic use in prepubertal children from low- and middle- income countries leads to increased growth particularly weight gain83 table 2. however these studies have only examined children with ongoing infections whose resolution with antibiotic therapy might have been the underlying cause of weight gain rather than the possi- ble alterations in the gut microbiota.seven recent epidemiological studies in healthy children have provided evidence that the use of antibiotics is associated with obe- sity84-90 table 2. these studies reported that antibiotic exposure in early life was linked to increased bmi and a greater prevalence of obesity among healthy children.84-90 this effect was more marked in children who were as follows i treated within the first 6 months of life ii exposed to 3 or more courses of antibiotics iii treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and iv males84-8890 table 2. notably the available evidence indicates that the associations of both gut mi- crobiome and antibiotic usage with childhood obesity are often sex- ually dimorphic.

it is possible for example that such dimorphism may result from differ- ential adaptive responses to diet physical activity and physiological stress.9192 clearly the evidence shows that observations made on one sex cannot be readily extrapolated to the other.a very recent meta-analysis of 15 studies by shao et al93 did find that early-life antibiotics exposure significantly increases risk of childhood obesity table 2. unfortunately as all these studies were observational in design it is difficult to pinpoint antibiotic usage as the primary cause of obesity without considering other confounding factors such as host genetics dietary changes maternal bmi breast- feeding maternal smoking and the infection itself.8485888994 some of the data in these studies were also potentially unreliable as they were based on recall of antibiotics usage and compliance with the pre- scribed antibiotic therapy was never reported.84878995in contrast 2 studies in 2016 suggest that there was no evidence that antibiotics had an effect on weight gain or on the development of obesity in children.9596 the first study showed no effects of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 2 years on weight gain in children with recurrent urinary tract infection96 table 2. however this study used a single class of antibiotics as pro- phylaxis so that the results might have been affected by the type and dose of antibiotics used.

further the angptl4 levels were suppressed in the gut epithelium leading to elevated lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in increasing triglyceride storage in adipocytes28 table 1. in 2006 turnbaugh et al31 showed that transferring gut bacteria from obese mice to germ-free ones led to increased fat mass in the recipients table 1. turnbaugh et al32 further demonstrated that transplanting obesogenic gut microbiome to germ-free mice resulted in nearly a threefold in- crease in fat mass compared to mice who received gut microbiome from lean donors table 1.more recently ridaura et al33 evaluated the effects of an obe- sogenic gut microbiome transfer from human donors to mouse re- cipients table 1. in contrast to earlier studies in mouse donors and recipients they demonstrated that introduction of faecal microbiota from an overweight adult twin to normal weight germ-free mice re- sulted in a rapid weight gain in the mice.

gerber et al95 reported on a large retrospec- tive longitudinal study of nearly 39 000 children finding that antibiotic exposure within the first 6 months of life did not affect weight gain between 2 and 5 years of age table 2. nonetheless as with other previous studies there was inadequate information regarding antibi- otic exposure and compliance with the prescribed therapy.6  does infection cause obesity alternatively infection rather than antibiotics could be the contrib- uting factor to the development of obesity.

however mice treated with faecal microbiota from the lean twin maintained their normal weight33 table 1. further compelling evidence of the effect of the gut micro- biome on obesity comes from a study on gut microbiome transfer from human donors post bariatric surgery to mouse recipients which pro- moted a reduction in fat deposition in recipient mice34 table 1. very recently liu et al35 showed that obese humans have fewer bacteroidestable 1 published evidence on a link between gut microbiome and obesitycontinuestable 1 continuedexp.

and decreasing bacteroides vulgatus numbers leading to a reduction in weight and adiposity as well as improving systemic inflammation and lipid metabolism table 1.gut microbiome transfer is an effective treatment for clostridium difficile infection.5556 however alang and kelly57 report an interesting case where a female patient with recurrent c. difficile infection devel- oped obesity following gut microbiome transfer table 1. of note it was reported that she had not lost any weight as a result of the infec- tion but developed new-onset obesity after receiving gut microbiome from a healthy but similarly overweight donor.

using both 16s rrna gene and metagenomics sequencing it was reported that there was less microbial diversity in terms of bac- terial species and strains at 3 years of age in the children exposed to antibiotics.66however there were apparent flaws in the studies published so far as the number of subjects were small and had significant demo- graphic heterogeneity.6367 the type of antibiotic used its route of ad- ministration and the subject's age at the time of administration seem to influence the effects on the gut microbiome.646869 in addition diet lifestyle other medications and products such as probiotics further complicate this conundrum.5370715  do antibiotics cause obesity antibiotics have been linked to a dysbiotic gut microbiome which in turn have been proposed to lead to obesity.

and other butyr- ate producers leading to improvements in metabolic outcomes and the gut barrier against pathogens.52 however prebiotic intervention is affected by the individual's gut microbiota composition and fibre intake.53 nicolucci et al54 recently demonstrated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial that the prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin altered the gut microbiota in children mainly increasing bifidobacterium spp.

further van nood et al58 showed an increase in bacterial diversity in patients with c. dif- ficile infection treated with gut microbiome transfer that was similar to that of healthy donors after donor-faeces infusion.
