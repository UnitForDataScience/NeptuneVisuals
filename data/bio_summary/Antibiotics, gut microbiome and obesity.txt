A limitation in that study was that the assessment of obesity was made by comparing BMI among children across a wide age range from 2 to 18 years and comparisons between children of similar age might have yielded different results.If infection is said to cause obesity should we also consider vi- ruses and other pathogenic organisms apart from bacteria as causative agents for obesity This concept infectobesity is not new and has been studied in animal models for the past 2 decades.97 At least ten different viruses have been reported to cause obesity in animals in- cluding canine distemper virus SMAM-1 avian adenovirus and human adenoviruses Ad36 and Ad37.98 Further SMAM-1 and Ad36 in par- ticular have been found to be associated with obesity in humans.9798 However beyond associations the role of these viruses in the devel- opment of obesity in humans remains unclear.7  CONCLUSION There are strong data supporting the role of antibiotics in the devel- opment of obesity in well-controlled animal models but evidence in humans remains inconclusive.

Turnbaugh et al32 further demonstrated that transplanting obesogenic gut microbiome to germ-free mice resulted in nearly a threefold in- crease in fat mass compared to mice who received gut microbiome from lean donors Table 1.More recently Ridaura et al33 evaluated the effects of an obe- sogenic gut microbiome transfer from human donors to mouse re- cipients Table 1.

The mechanisms by which antibiotics modulate weight gain are unclear but several hypotheses have been proposed472 which include the following i increased ability from gut bacteria to extract energy from indigestible polysaccharidesreduction in the number of bacteria that are metabolically protective against obesity iii altered hepatic lipogenesis iv altered metabolic signalling and v reduction in intestinal defence and immunity.Since the 1950s antibiotics have been added to food and water in pigs cows and chickens as an effective method to enhance growth especially weight gain.73 This practice has been widely adopted by farmers and a number of different antibiotics have been used for this purpose.74-76 Notably early-life exposure to antibiotics in these ani- mals has far greater effects on weight gain and feed efficiency than if exposure occurred in later life.74Not surprisingly evidence from animal models has shown a direct link between treatment with low doses of antibiotics and changes in body composition.1577 In 2012 Cho et al77 demonstrated that admin- istration of subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics increased adiposity in young mice and also altered the intestinal microbiome Table 2.

It is possible for example that such dimorphism may result from differ- ential adaptive responses to diet physical activity and physiological stress.9192 Clearly the evidence shows that observations made on one sex cannot be readily extrapolated to the other.A very recent meta-analysis of 15 studies by Shao et al93 did find that early-life antibiotics exposure significantly increases risk of childhood obesity Table 2.
