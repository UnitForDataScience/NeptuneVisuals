Whole saliva is a complex mix of fluids from major and minor salivary glands and from gingival crevicular fluid which contains oral bacteria and food debris.6 It is composed of 99 of water and 1 of electrolytes secretory proteins immunoglobulins and organic molecules.7Salivary function can be organized into five major categories lubrication and protection buffering action and clearance maintenance of tooth integrity antibacterial activity taste and digestion.78The average daily flow of whole saliva varies in health between 1 and 1.5 L. Salivary flow is categorized as unstimulated or resting and stimulated flow rate.9Normal salivation Unstimulated whole saliva is 0.1-1 mlmin stimulated whole saliva is 0.5-3.5 mlmin.9 Hyposalivation Unstimulated whole saliva is 0.1 mlmin stimulated whole saliva is 0.5 mlmin.9 Hypersalivation Unstimulated whole saliva is 1 mlmin stimulated whole saliva is 3.5 mlmin.9The saliva flow rate varies from person to person and is influenced by various factors such as degree of hydration body position exposure to light previous stimulation circadian rhythms and gland size.10Xerostomia is a subjective complaint of dry mouth that may result from decrease in the production of saliva.

Although aging is associated with a loss of functional gland parenchyma it can be clinically compensated for by the reserve capacity of the salivary glands which is apparently high in healthy controls as suggested by Vissink et al.4 Although the feeling of xerostomia is commonly found in the elderly this may also be explained by an impaired or altered psychosensory function affecting the perception of oral moisture or by changes in the chemical composition of the saliva.4In the present study out of 50 samples 32 samples 64 showed Candida colony formation which was consistent with other study conducted by Torres et al.4 in which 67.9 of patients with xerostomia werecolonized by Candida.More number of samples with hyposalivation was found to have Candida colonization than samples with normal salivation which was similar to studies conducted by Torres et al.4 and Navazesh et al.5In a study conducted by Navazesh et al.5 who collected both unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva showed that unstimulated whole saliva was a better predictor for Candida counts and stimulated whole saliva was a good predictor.

Patients were given both verbal and written information about the nature of the study and written consent was obtained.Method of collection of dataSaliva collection method For all the selected patients intraoral clinical examination was done to record any features of xerostomia.Samples of chewing-stimulated whole saliva were obtained under standard conditions.Patients were asked not to eat drink water exempted smoke or perform any oral hygiene habits 1 h before saliva collection.

Collected saliva samples were transported in ice packs to the laboratory and inoculated within 2 h.Culture method In the laboratory saliva samples were centrifuged for 2 min.

Twenty 40 samples showed more than or equal to 400 CFUml of saliva and 30 60 samples showed less 400 CFUml of saliva.

In the present study stimulated whole saliva was used.Various studies conducted by Torres et al.4 showed more number of C. albicans species in saliva of xerostomia patients followed by Candida parapsilosis and C. tropicalis which was consistent with the present study.In our study out of fifty patients 34 68 were medically compromised and were under one or many medications for the same.

Hence it is necessary to evaluate the relationship between salivary flow rates SFRs and Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia.AimsThis study aims to determine and evaluate the relationship between SFRs and Candida colony forming units CFUs in patients with xerostomia.Settings and DesignThis study was a descriptive study.Subjects and MethodsThe study participants were taken from the patients attending outpatient department in a private dental college.

Chewing stimulated whole saliva samples were collected from them and their SFRs were assessed.

The salivary calcium-binding myelomonocytic L1 protein or calciprotein also play a role in the defense against oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients.5With the increasing numbers of geriatric and medically compromised patients being seen by dental practitioners and oral diagnosticians longitudinal evaluation of whole saliva should be considered as part of the clinical evaluation to identify patients at risk for candidiasis and prevent clinical complications.4The current study is therefore undertaken to determine and evaluate the relationship between SFRs and Candida colony forming units CFUs in patients with xerostomia.SUBJECTS AND METHODSSource of dataGo toThe study participants were taken from the patients attending the outpatient department of a private dental college.

Fifty patients who answered affirmatively to few of the questions in the questionnaire were included in the study.Questionnaire used for the selection of patients with xerostomiaDoes your mouth feel dry when eating a mealDo you have difficulty in swallowing any foodDo you sip liquids to aid in swallowing dry foodsDoes the amount of saliva in your mouth seem to be reduced most of the timeDoes your mouth feel dry at night or on awakeningDo you chew gum or use candy to relieve oral drynessDoes your mouth feel dry during daytimeDo you usually wake up thirsty at nightDo you have problems in tasting foodDoes your tongue burnPatients who had been on corticosteroids andor antibiotics within previous 3 months were excluded from the study.Ethical clearanceThe study protocol was approved by Institutional Ethical Committee.
