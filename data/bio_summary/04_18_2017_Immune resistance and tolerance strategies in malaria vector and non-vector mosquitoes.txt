Using this approach the mosquito immune system can be designed to aug- ment parasite killing by targeting mosquito anti-malarial regulators that function upon binding to the parasite surface for example SPCLIP1 that binds to the ookinete and facilitates complement attacks Alternatively the premature killing of mosquito vectors before the para- site completes the gonotrophic cycle can be achieved through transgenic approaches.

The mosquito immune system has been identified as a key factor that can influence whether Plasmodium infection establishes within the mosquito vector.

The first two mosquito species are major vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa while the third is thought to be a non-vector.Methods All three mosquito species were reared in mixed cultures.

The dissection was carried out using cold PBS on ice and midguts were then immediately transferred to Eppendorf tubes with tissue lysis buffer.In each of the above experiments mosquito carcases were used for species ID.dsRNA synthesis and mosquito injectiondsRNA production was performed  using gene spe- cific oligonucleotide primers flanked by the short T7 promoter sequence TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG.

To test the hypothesis that mosquito immune competence and sur- vival are interrelated we knocked down in co-cultured mosquito populations the NF-kB transcription factor REL2 and thus silenced the antibacterial Imd pathway and the negative regulator of REL1 Cactus As a result we ectopically activated the Toll pathway that shares most of its downstream effectors with those of the Imd pathway and is thought to be antifungal unpublished data.

In this study experiments were conducted using a mosquito management protocol that minimises possible biases introduced during mosquito rearing maintenance and handling.

Targeting tolerance or resistance to microbiota in the mosquito gut could be exploited towards modifying the mosquito immune response against Plasmodium in the haemocoel and inducing premature death due to the collateral damage of internal organs.

Their capacity to eliminate P. berghei and regulate midgut bacteria was examined.Results Our results revealed large differences in mosquito resistance to P. berghei.

In all three mosquito species immune reactions involving the complement system were triggered when the number of parasites that mosquitoes were challenged with exceeded a certain level i.e.
