These protocols included substituting a novel multienzyme blend called Polyzyme in place of lysozyme and further extraction of DNA to recover long fragment length DNA compatible with long sequencing strategies.

Figure 4B depicts the different DNA yields of this mock community using different DNA extraction kits.

This when used in combination with the XMP multifaceted DNA extraction method that uses hexadecyltrimethylam- monium bromide SDS phenol chloroform and magnetic beads proves increased recovery of high MW DNA onFIGURE 5MGRG Polyzyme mixture workflow and extrac- tion results.
