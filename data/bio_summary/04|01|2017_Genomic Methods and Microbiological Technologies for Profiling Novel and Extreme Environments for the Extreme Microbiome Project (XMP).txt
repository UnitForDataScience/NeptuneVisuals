nonetheless discoveries made in the field of microbiome will have amajor impact on understanding health the way we handle food the way we build buildings subways boats and airplanes or disease transmission by comprehending the metagenomics of biofilms for example.17 regardless of the area of research the field of microbiome research remains one of the fastest growing and most exciting areas of biologic research today with possibly the most significant discoveries yet to come.authorshipc.e.m.

lab for the discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters bgcs which will be used on unassembled or minimally assembled complex metagenomic data and cultured and uncultured microbes.23 the applica- tion of the metabgc pipeline previously has been demon- strated successfully on the new york city pathomap datasets5 by detecting novel and predicted thiopeptide bgcs on steel subway railings after hurricane sandy.17conclusionthe xmp is helping to make unique contributions to the field of microbiome and metagenomics research specifi- cally in new methods and product development.

many of these techniques have yet to be fully developed which is why the abrf mgrg was established representing a pioneer- ing research consortium dedicated to characterizing the current methods and development of new methods for ubiquitous metagenomics and microbiomes studies.the understanding of extremophiles--their genomes molecular machinery and how they interact with their environments--has potential health and research benefits for humanity.

as extremophilic samples are extraordinarily difficult to work with they require new approaches that can be applied to other microbiome projects both small contributions such as development of nucleic acid-free reagents standards and protocol or complex questions such as discovering clues to synthetic gene clusters or new antibiotics.

all materials for extraction sequencing and analysis have been contributed by the devoted corporate research partners of xmp including mostafa ronaghi rob cohen and clotilde teiling at illumina fiona stewart at new england biolabs adam morris at bioo scientific mike farrell and ken guo at omegar01ns076465 r01ai125416 r01es021006 bill and melinda gatesfoundation opp1151054 and alfred p. sloan foundation g-2015- 13964.the authors thank europlanet 2020 ri from the european union's horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 654208 funded danakil work for the ethiopian hot springs.disclosures the authors have read and understood the journal of biomolecular techniques' policies on declaration of interests and herein declare the following interests n.greenfield is employed by and retains ownership in reference genomics one codex.

this research is still underway and efficiency data will be published in a future manuscript.development of microbial reference standardsanother major challenge for metagenomics and micro- biome research is the lack of microbial reference standards and controls for determination of protocol efficiencies fordna extraction dna sequencing and bioinformatics.

these new methods take into account previous abrf data data from scientific corporate partners and current ongoing studies by members of the abrf mgrg metagenomics and metadesign of the subways and urban biomes international consortium17 and international metagenomics and microbiome stan- dards alliance.18 standardization of these methods have included the use of polyzyme a novel enzyme blend of microbial lytic enzymes that digest cell-wall components and allow for more efficient lysis of the resulting sphearoplasts or protoplasts.

these protocols included substituting a novel multienzyme blend called polyzyme in place of lysozyme and further extraction of dna to recover long fragment length dna compatible with long sequencing strategies.
