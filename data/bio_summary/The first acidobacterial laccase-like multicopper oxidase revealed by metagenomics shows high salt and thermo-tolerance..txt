after centrifugation at 34000xg for 60 min at 4 degc n-terminus his6-tagged lacm was purified from the soluble cytoplasmic fraction by loading e. coli crude extracts heated for 20 min at 50 degc and centrifuged at 17000xg for 30 min onto a 5-ml hitrap chelating affinity column ge healthcare sciences little chalfont uk load- ed with 0.1 mm cuso4 and equilibrated with 20 mm kpi ph 6.7 20 mm imidazole and 300 mm na2so4.

this effect was confirmed by zymo- gram electrophoresis of purified lacm with 50 mm cuso4 in the developing buffer 100 mm sodium acetate ph 4.0 the intensity of the activity band was significantly enhanced both using abts and 26-dmp as substrates data not shown.

activities are reported as values relative to the activity of 2.4 umg protein set as 100 at ph 4.0. c effect of temperature on lacm activity using abts as a substrate at ph 4.0 in the presence of 50 mm cuso4.

the activity measured at ph 4.0 and 25 degc in the presence of 50 mm cuso4 and without nacl 2.4 umg was set as 100. f lacm decolorization of reactive black 5 circles or brilliant green squares in the presence black marks continuous line or absence white marks dotted line of 10 mm abts.

at 40 and 60 degc the enzyme maintained 65 and 56 of the maximum activity respectively whereas at 30 degc and 70 degc the activity of lacm was slightly below 40. furthermore activity of lacm was severely reduced below 20 degc.

interestingly between 95 and 85 of lacm activity was pre- served in the presence of nacl concentrations up to 100 mm and 34 and 10 residual activities were still detectable after enzyme incubation with 500 and 1000 mm nacl fig.

in the presence of dmso the activity decreased yet almost 50 of the initial activity was retained at 10 vv dmso.dye decolorizationenzymatic decolorization of six synthetic dyes by the purified lacm was assessed in the presence or absence of 10 mm abts as a redox mediator.

20 activity preserved even at ph 8.0. the enzyme was thermostable and heat-activated in the interval 40-60 degc with an optimal activity on abts at 50 degc.
