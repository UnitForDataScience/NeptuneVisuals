c. Interestingly when the Hi-trap column was loaded with CuSO4 instead of NiCl2 the activity of the purified enzyme on ABTS tripled indicating the positive effect of copper addition for the enzyme activity at this stage.

Activities are reported as values relative to the activity of 2.4 Umg protein set as 100 at pH 4.0. c Effect of temperature on LacM activity using ABTS as a substrate at pH 4.0 in the presence of 50 mM CuSO4.

The activity recorded at time 0 in standard assay condition 25 degC pH 4.0 50 mM CuSO4 is set as 100 2.4 U mg. e Effect of increasing concentrations of NaCl on LacM activity was measured using ABTS.

At 40 and 60 degC the enzyme maintained 65 and 56 of the maximum activity respectively whereas at 30 degC and 70 degC the activity of LacM was slightly below 40.

d but it displayed a substantial heat activation since after 2 h at 40 50 or 60 degC its enzymatic activity increased and it was approximately 1.2 3.5 and 1.2-fold higher that the initial activity.

MgSO4 andZnSO4 inhibited LacM activity to a smaller extent than chlo- ride salts while at low concentrations K2SO4 and CoNO3 as well as MgSO4 even increased the enzyme activity.

Among the surfactants tested Nonidet P-40 Tween-20 and NLS considerably reduced LacM activity only at 10 vv final concentration while with 1 vv detergent more than 80 of the original activity was preserved.

In the presence of DMSO the activity decreased yet almost 50 of the initial activity was retained at 10 vv DMSO.Dye decolorizationEnzymatic decolorization of six synthetic dyes by the purified LacM was assessed in the presence or absence of 10 mM ABTS as a redox mediator.

LacM showed higher activity on the non-phenolic ABTS  k cat kM  0.47 s-1 mM-1 for Lac591 8.45 s-1 mM-1 for LacM but lower activity on the phenolic 26-DMP kcat k  283 s-1 mM-1 for Lac591.

Probably only a fraction of the enzyme molecules produced had indeed four copper atoms in the ac- tive site which is in our case supported by the fact that addi- tion of copper was essential for active protein production and purification and significantly enhanced its activity if added to the reaction mixture.A general tendency of bacterial compared to fungal laccases and laccase-like enzymes is their activity in a wider pH range Reiss et al.
