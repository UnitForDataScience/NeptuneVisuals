Despite not showing any significant differences across reactorsTable 2 Relative abundance  of genera identified as syntrophic or methanogenic in the anaerobic digesters R1 R2 R3 and R4 0 1 mgL 150 mgL and 20 mgL of tetracycline hydrochloride respectively R4B21 and R4A21 represents the samples collected from R4 before and after day 21 respectivelyAn asterisk denotes that average relative abundance was significantly different p  0.05 than that of the control R1.

For sample clusters R4B21 and R4A21 an asterisk indicates a significant difference in relative abundance for that particular genera when compared to each otherthe methanogenic genus Methanoculleus increased in relative abundance by over one-fold after day 21 of operation in R4.Changes in relative abundance of propionate producers propionate utilizers and fermentative bacteriumCalculations performed based on BEST biota andor environ- ment matching analysis showed that the two variables representing propionic acid and methane production were most likely to be responsible for the spatial distribution of the microbial communities in the MDS r  0.337 p  0.01.

The average abundance of tetZ and tetG were not significantly different regardless of whether the abundance was normalized against MLVSS or16S rRNA copies p  0.09 for all.

noted that increasing the concentrations of sul- famethoxazole to 45 mgL could cause VFA to accumulate to a range of 35 to 438 mgL in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor AnSBR.VFAs otherwise referred to as short chain fatty acids SCFAs that include acetate butyrate and propionate are in- termediate andor end products of the digestion process and their concentrations have been observed to correlate with over- all functionality of the anaerobic treatment process Ahring et al.

Given the potential drawbacks associated with methane recovery from anaerobic digestion developing the anaerobic fermentation process to yield higher-value end products has become a topic of interest in recent years Kleerebezem et al.

Normalization against 16S rRNA copies showed that the average abundance of tetZ and tetG was3.40 x 10-5 - 1.67 x 10-5 copies16S rRNA copies and1.75 x 10-5 - 1.74 x 10-5 copies16S rRNA copies respec- tively in all reactors.DiscussionThe present study explored the performance of anaerobic di- gesters under different tetracycline exposure levels.

Hence future studies that involve cultivation of these bacterial species in pure microcosms to verify their roles in VFA utilization rates and propionate accumulation should be performed.Despite the potentially positive economic impact of antibi- otics on the anaerobic digestion process changes in the cor- responding abundance of antibiotic resistance genes should also be taken into consideration.

For example both the abundance of tetW and tetQ in anaerobic co-digestion of pig manure and wheat straw increased from 1.68 x 109 to 4.92 x 109 copiesg and from 9.33 x 106 to 3.43 x 107 copiesg respectively as the oxytetracycline concentrations increased from 0 to 140 mgkg dry sludge Wang et al.
