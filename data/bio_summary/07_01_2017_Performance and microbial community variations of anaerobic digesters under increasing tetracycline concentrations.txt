similarly the abundance of tetq increased by at least 1000 times from under detectable limits to 1 x 103 copiesml of wastewater when a cocktail of pharmaceuticals containing an initial concentration of 10 mgl sulfamethoxazole 0.5 mgl erythromycin and 0.5 mgl tetracycline increased to 20 mgl sulfamethoxazole 1.5 mgl erythromycin and1.5 mgl tetracycline aydin et al.

another fermentative species that showed significantly lower relative abundance in r4 as compared to r1 was macellibacteroides fermentans which decreased in relative abundance from 1.35 in r1 to 0.44 in r4 p  0.05. this species however was significantly higher in r3 than in the control with a relative abundance of 9.27 in r3 p  0.05. similarly the sulfate-reducing desulfomicrobium baculatum also significantly increased in relative abundance in r3 0.24 as compared to the control 0.08 but was lower in r4 at 0.02 p  0.05.increased abundance of tetw and tetq genes in r4 during the latter operational phaseboth tetw and tetq genes confer resistance against tetracycline by the ribosomal protection protein rpp.

the four reactors with 0 mgl 1 mgl 150 mgl and 20 mgl of tc-hcl are subsequently referred to as r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively.

for sample clusters r4b21 and r4a21 an asterisk indicates a significant difference in relative abundance for that particular genera when compared to each otherthe methanogenic genus methanoculleus increased in relative abundance by over one-fold after day 21 of operation in r4.changes in relative abundance of propionate producers propionate utilizers and fermentative bacteriumcalculations performed based on best biota andor environ- ment matching analysis showed that the two variables representing propionic acid and methane production were most likely to be responsible for the spatial distribution of the microbial communities in the mds r  0.337 p  0.01. a number of operational taxonomic units otus known to produce vfas were therefore further evaluated and were observed to increase significantly in relative abundance in r4 as compared to the control.

the remaining reactors were individually added with 1 mgl 150 mgl and 20 mgl to approximate the concentrations of tc-hcl present in domestic wastewater yang et al.

phase 1 occurred before day 21 and it was observed that the propionic acid concentration increased at a rate of 2.9 mglday from0.7 mgl on day 6 to 44 mgl on day 21. thereafter the rate of increment for propionic acid was 12 mglday and the measured concentration on day 39 was 260 mgl.changes of cod conversion products in biomass and vfa for highest antibiotic concentrationcod concentrations in r1 r2 and r3 were on average 208 - 17 mgl and not significantly different among these three reactors all p  0.05 fig.

the two most abundant syntrophic bacterial genera showed consistent relative abundances across r1 to r3 but were significantly lower i n r 4. to il lustrate syntrophorhabdus and unclassified syntrophobacteraceae both decreased in relative abundance from 0.25 and 0.54 in r1 to0.13 and 0.34 in r4 respectively p  0.05. furthermore within r4 there was also a significant decrease in relative abundance for both syntrophorhabdus and unclassified syntrophobacteraceae in samples taken after day 21 as com- pared to those taken prior day 21. conversely higher relative abundance of syntrophomonas was observed in r4 compared to the other three reactors.

noted that increasing the concentrations of sul- famethoxazole to 45 mgl could cause vfa to accumulate to a range of 35 to 438 mgl in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor ansbr.vfas otherwise referred to as short chain fatty acids scfas that include acetate butyrate and propionate are in- termediate andor end products of the digestion process and their concentrations have been observed to correlate with over- all functionality of the anaerobic treatment process ahring et al.
