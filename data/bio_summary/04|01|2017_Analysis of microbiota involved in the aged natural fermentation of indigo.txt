The early-phase microbiota may fluctuate depending on the material and preparation proce- dure and the transitional change of the microbiota may also differ depending on the original microbiota and the mainte- nance procedure.

The results of 16S rRNA gene-targeting molecular analyses showed that non- indigo-reducing haloalkaliphilic Halomonas populations were drastically substituted with indigo-reducing Amphi- bacillus populations and these substitution correspond to significant increases in the state of indigo reduction.The natural occurrence of proper microbiota for fermen- tation and the maintenance of reduced states by the action of the microbiota depends on the applied materials i.e.

The microbiota in the aged fermenta- tion fluid consisted mainly of the genera Alkalibacterium Amphibacillus Anaerobacillus and Polygonibacillus and the family Proteinivoraceae.

The changes to the microbiota in one early-phase batch of indigo fermentation fluid and two aged batches were examined.Materials and methodsIndigo fermentation samplesAliquots from two different batches of indigo fermenta- tion aged 6 and 10 months D1-6M and D1-10M respec- tively and aged 9 11 and 14 months D2-9M D2-11M and D2-14M respectively were obtained from the indigo fermentation craft centre in Date City Hokkaido Japan 42deg 28' 14.977''N 140deg 52' 31.648''E.

The higher flexibility of the early-stage fermen- tation fluid was related to variations in the microbiota and nutritional conditions e.g.

The microbiota in aged fermenta- tion fluids mainly consists of the genera Alkalibacterium Amphibacillus Polygonibacillus and Anaerobacillus and the family Proteinivoraceae.

The indigo-reducing microbiota in the aged fermentation fluids maintained for more than 6 months were drastically changed over a period of more than 3 months.

The indigo-reducing bacterial consortia consisted of various indigo-reducing species that exhibited notable transitional microbiota changes over a period of 3 months.

The con- tinuous presence of indigo-reducing bacteria through the replacement of previous bacterial species in the microbiota is important for maintaining a long-term indigo-reducing state in the fermentation fluid.

However the mechanisms underlying the main- tenance of reduced state in the indigo fermentation fluid by the microbiota over such a long period remain unclear particularly because the microbiota should be changed over this long period because of the considerable opportunities for contamination via the artisans' hands or by the cloths used in the dyeing process.
