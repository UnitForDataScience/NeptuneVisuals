We conclude that a diversity measure is a good proxy for overall protocol performance and accuracy of the recovered abundance profile.Between-individual variationWithin-individual timepoint variation Between-protocol variationWithin-specimen and preservation variation Within-specimen variationPreservation variation Library preparation variation Within-protocol variationFigure 3 Effect of DNA extraction protocol and library preparation on sample composition.

To ensure comparability across such different studies we computed distances between all samples on the same subset of relatively abundant microbes by removing mOTUs whose summed abundance over all samples was below 0.01 of the total microbial abundance.For assessing variation induced by library preparation we used the same extracted DNA from 12 samples and subjected it to two library prepa- ration methods the standard and high-throughput approaches.

These indicated that protocol 12 and to a lesser extent protocols 3 8 11 16 and 18 as well had an abundance profile that differed from most of the other protocols.Analysis of functional microbiome composition based on clus- ters of orthologous groups and Online Methods showedthat the majority of extraction protocol effects were greater than biological variation within specimens and across time points within the same individual  and some of them were greater even than between-subject variability.

Here we tested 21 representative DNA extraction protocols on the same fecal samples and quantified differences in observed microbial community composition.We compared them with differences due to library preparation and sample storage which we contrasted with observed biological variation within the same specimen or within an individual over time.

Using a Euclidean distance which cumulates abundance deviations we found that many protocols were not com- parable and actually introduce large batch effects at the species level with the median between-protocol distance being higher than the within-specimen variation  hampering the comparability of samples generated with different extraction methods.

Each lab performed at least four extrac- tions after which the DNA was shipped to a single sequencing center GENOSCOPE France which tested two different library prepara- tion methods on a subset of samples Online Methods before per- forming identical sequencing and analytical methods in an attempt to minimize other possible sources of variation.In a second phase after considering the quantity and integrity of extracted DNA the recovered diversity and the observed ratio of Gram-positive bacteria we selected five protocols numbers 1 6 7 9 and 15 see Supplementary Methods for full descriptions of all 21 protocols.

The resulting variation in taxonomic and gene functional composition estimates should be considered in terms of both effect size and consistency if protocol differences result in an effect larger than the biological variation of interest for example in an intervention study it will mask that signal.

For example protocol 18 recovered 100 times more DNA than protocols 3 and 12 and recovered 10 times more than protocols 8 19 and 20 .

In total 143 libraries extracted using 21 different protocols passed the quality requirements imposed above though as an example only 4 of 18 samples extracted with protocol 16 one sample A and three sample B replicates met the require- ments Supplementary Data 3.
