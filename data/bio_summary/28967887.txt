each lab performed at least four extrac- tions after which the dna was shipped to a single sequencing center genoscope france which tested two different library prepara- tion methods on a subset of samples online methods before per- forming identical sequencing and analytical methods in an attempt to minimize other possible sources of variation.in a second phase after considering the quantity and integrity of extracted dna the recovered diversity and the observed ratio of gram-positive bacteria we selected five protocols numbers 1 6 7 9 and 15 see supplementary methods for full descriptions of all 21 protocols.

the variation introduced by storage method rnalater versus frozen was larger than within-protocol variation and as previously showna1.0021201918170.7516151413120.5011109870.25654320.001212019301817smaller than within-specimen variation in taxonomic space.16taken together these results show that different dna extraction protocols result in substantial technical variation both in taxonomic and in functional space highlighting that this is a crucial step in any microbiome study.quality control for species-specific abundance variation having quantified and contextualized the different biological and technical sources of variation we next assessed the quality of dif-141312111098761054321b1.002120ferent dna extraction protocolsby investigating species-19specific effects and measured diversity.

2. these indicated that protocol 12 and to a lesser extent protocols 3 8 11 16 and 18 as well had an abundance profile that differed from most of the other protocols.analysis of functional microbiome composition based on clus- ters of orthologous groups and online methods showedthat the majority of extraction protocol effects were greater than biological variation within specimens and across time points within the same individual  and some of them were greater even than between-subject variability.

to ensure comparability across such different studies we computed distances between all samples on the same subset of relatively abundant microbes by removing motus whose summed abundance over all samples was below 0.01 of the total microbial abundance.for assessing variation induced by library preparation we used the same extracted dna from 12 samples and subjected it to two library prepa- ration methods the standard and high-throughput approaches.

in total 143 libraries extracted using 21 different protocols passed the quality requirements imposed above though as an example only 4 of 18 samples extracted with protocol 16 one sample a and three sample b replicates met the require- ments supplementary data 3. for other protocols small numbers of samples were discarded for lack of compliance with quality andor quantity criteria.quality control for variability in microbial compositionall metagenomes were compared with respect to taxonomic and functional composition to quantify the relative abundances of microbial taxa and their respective gene-encoded functions onlinea 1007550250b432protocolmethods.

however we caution that additional considerations may apply such as that of kit contamina- tion which may differ between the protocols investigated here and would for example have a high impact on samples with low biomass.protocol q together with standard methods for sample collection and library preparation can be found on the ihms website   and in the online methods.

these are due to variations within protocols in library preparation in sample preservation within specimens between timepoints sampled from the same individual and between individuals.to assess the variation induced by different preservation methods namely freezing and rnalater we used data from franzosa et al.and compared the same sample preserved with the two different methods.

using a euclidean distance which cumulates abundance deviations we found that many protocols were not com- parable and actually introduce large batch effects at the species level with the median between-protocol distance being higher than the within-specimen variation  hampering the comparability of samples generated with different extraction methods.

to determine which species significantly differed in abundance between extraction methods a kruskal-wallis test was applied for each species with nonzero abundance in at least two protocols across both samples.

for this we compared the estimated abundance of a given species in all replicates of a given protocol to the abundances of that species in all replicates of all other protocols by performing a kruskal-wallis test online methods.

protocols 15 6 and 9 use the same qiagen-based lysis and extraction kit and were combined into a slightly modified protocol which we coded q supplementary methods.

in the first phase to assess the variability introduced by different dna extraction methods we produced mul- tiple aliquots of two stool samples obtained from two individuals and named sample a and b. within 2 h of emission the samples were homogenized in an anaerobic cabinet to ensure that the different aliquots had identical microbial compositions and aliquots of 200 mg were frozen at -80 degc within 4 h. we shipped four aliquots of eachfixationspecimenstorage shippingextractionlibrary preparationsequencingbioinformatic processingsample frozen on dry ice to 21 collaborating laboratories in 11 countries on three continents.

as this study also used different storage methods for some samples we were able to quantify the effect of both within-specimen variation and storage together.
