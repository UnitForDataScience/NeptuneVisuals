The present review aimed to discuss the efficacy offiber supplementation in the treatment of IBS the type of dietary fiber that should be recommended and the mechanisms under- lying the effects of dietary fiber particularly those concerning the interaction between fibers microbiota the immune system and the neuroendocrine regulatory system of the gut.Types and characteristics of dietary fiberDifferent types of dietary fiber are characterized by marked differences in physical and chemical structure with the health benefits of dietary fiber being specific to each fiber type 23.

Dietary fiber also has other health benefits such as lowering blood cholesterol levels improving glycemic control and body weight management.Correspondence to Professor Magdy El-Salhy Division of Gastro- enterology Department of Medicine Stord Hospital Box 4000 5416 Stord NorwayE-mailKey words microbiota enteric nervous system fermentation immune system intestinal endocrine cells laxation meteorism psylliumContentsIntroductionTypes and characteristics of dietary fiberMechanisms of action of dietary fiber in IBSFiber supplementation in the treatment of IBSConclusionIntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome IBS is a chronic common gastrointes- tinal disorder with a prevalence of 10-20 among the adult population worldwide 1-15.

Since FODMAPs by definition constitute dietary fiber these observations show that changing the dietary fiber intake is associated with changes in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells.Short-chain fatty acids particularly butyrate produced by the fermentation of dietary fiber have been found to affect neurons of the enteric nervous system 119139.

psyllium is minimally fermented and forms a gel that is preserved during its passage through the large bowel and normalizes the stool form 2676-79.Interaction of dietary fiber with microbiota and the immune system.

Recommending fiber supplementation to patients with IBS is also inexpensive while having documented effects on IBS symptoms and other health benefits 23147149.ConclusionDietary fiber affects the bowel habits through increasing the stool bulk with mechanical stimulation of the colonic mucosa.The fermentation of dietary fiber by intestinal microbiota lowers the luminal pH and has several byproducts such as gas and short-chain fatty acids.
