The present study was therefore conducted to examine whether the gut microbiota plays a role in the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of R-ketamine and lanicemine in a chronic social defeat stress CSDS model.ResultsR-ketamine but not lanicemine shows rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in sus- ceptible mice after CSDS.

The antidepressant effects of R-ketamine 10 mgkg and lanicemine 10 mgkg in susceptible mice after CSDS were examined Fig.

Ketamine an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NMDAR antagonist showed rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressed patients.In contrast another NMDAR antagonist lanicemine did not exhibit antidepressant effects insuch patients.

In behavioral tests R-ketamine showed antidepressant effects in the susceptible mice whereas lanicemine did not.

Furthermore both R-ketamine and lanicemine significantly attenuated the reduced levels of Mogibacteriaceae in the susceptible mice although the effects of lanicemine were less potent than R-ketamine.

These findings suggest that altered composition of gut microbiota in the CSDS susceptible mice might play a role in the depression-like phenotype and that the improvement of the altered composition of gut microbiota in the susceptible mice by R-ketamine might play in part a role in its rapid antidepressant effect.Figure 2.

Nonetheless further studies on the role of the order Clostridiales including the genus Clostridium in depression and antidepressant actions of R-ketamine are needed.The present data do not provide direct evidence of the effect of gut microbiota on the antidepressant actions of R-ketamine because behavioral experiments using germ-free mice were not performed.

Effects of R-ketamine and lanicemine in the depression-like phenotype susceptible mice after CSDS.a The schedule of CSDS model treatment behavioral tests and feces collection.

The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of feces demonstrated that R-ketamine but not lanicemine significantly attenuated the altered levels of Bacteroidales Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae in the susceptible mice after CSDS.
