instead of p. acnes other species were discovered including p. avidum in the healthy group 224 8.3 p. granulosum in the acne group 148 2.1 and p. namnetense in the acne group 348 6.3. however no significant difference in bacteria diversity was noted on the back between acne and healthy indivi- duals p  0.820. in addition no significant difference in bacteria diversity was noted between the face samples from subjects with acne and healthy subjects p  0.690.p.

the change in balance of cutaneous p. acnes subgroups might be an inducing factor in the ac- tivation of p. acnes which could trigger inflammation.key words acne p. acnes phylotypes clonal complexes slst- types.accepted nov 13 2017 epub ahead of print nov 14 2017acta derm venereol 2018 98 262-267.corr brigitte dreno department of dermatology nantes university hos- pital 1 place alexis ricordeau fr-44035 nantes cedex 01 france.

some p. acnes phylotypes are associated with skin disease conditions such as phylotype iii and progressive macular hypome- lanosis 16. moreover different p. acnes phylotypes are known to induce distinct immune responses in the context of acne 12 17. the aim of this study was to determine and compare the different p. acnes phylotypes ccs and slst types on the face and back of patients with severe acne of the back vs. a healthy population.materials and methodsrecruitment of healthy volunteers and patientsat the first visit patients with acne who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected.

1.in healthy group samples 41.6 belonged to the cc53 subgroup phylotype ii and k slst-types 20.8 of the p. acnes strains belonged to the cc18 subgroup and 16.6 to the cc28 subgroup belonging to phylotype ia1 including slst-types a1 c1 and d1 figs 3 and 4. taking into account the location face or back 50.0 of the back samples were cc53 phylotype ii including k1 k2 and k8 slst-types 16.6 were cc28 phylotype ia1 including d1 slst-type 8.3 were cc18 phylo- type ia1 and a1 slst-type 8.3 were cc3 phylotype ia1 and c1 slst-type and finally 8.3 were cc43 phylotype iii and new slst-type named l7 figs 3 and 4. concerning the face zone 33.3 of the strains were cc18 phylotype ia1 and a1 slst-type and 33.3 were cc53 phylotype ii including k1 and a new slst-type named k16 whereas 16.6 were cc28 phylotypes ia1 and ia2 corresponding to d1 and f4 slst-types and 16.6 were cc36 phylotype ib and h1 slst-types figs 3 and 4.interestingly the only p. acnes phylotype iii found in this study was recovered in the healthy group associa- ted with cc43 and a new slst-type l7 not previously described.in acne group samples 58.3 of the p. acnes strains belonged to cc18 and 16.6 belonged to cc28 including slst types a1 a5 c1 d1 and e3 fig.

reviewed p. acnes molecular typing methods and pointed out the importance of investigating p. acnes populations in acne vulgaris 38. the microbiological results presented here may be crucial for the elaboration of innovative therapies such as probiotic treatments as suggested previously 38. for instance future topical treatments could restore the phylotype diversity through re-introduction of p. acnes subgroup cc53.

in addition to acne p. acnes has also been implicated in deep infections and orthopaedic ab- scesses 5-7 lung abscesses 8 prostate cancer 9 and sarcoidosis 10. its development in deep infections may be related to the secretion of a biofilm that increases both its adherence to surfaces and antibiotic resistance 11.in the skin p. acnes as an anaerobic bacterium is located more specifically in the pilo-sebaceous follic- les.

a number of studies have shown that p. acnes can activate innate immunity mainly via toll-like receptors tlrs expressed by keratinocytes and monocytes 12 13. p. acnes also stimulates the secretion of interleukins il-12 il-8 il-1b and il-17 cytokines by monocytes 14. thus it plays a crucial role in the development of inflammatory lesions in acne.p.

colonies with the macroscopic morphology of p. acnes were picked from each plate to recover the predominant strain of p. acnes.

all strains were identified accurately with a value  99.9.dna extraction and phylotype determinationtotal dna from p. acnes isolates was extracted using the insta- gene matrix method bio-rad laboratories hercules ca usa according to the manufacturer's instructions.the 6 main phylotypes for all isolates were determined as de- scribed previously 21.multi- and single-locus sequence type determination and sequencing protocolmlst is a method to determine to which clonal complex a p. acnes strain belongs.

1.in conclusion there was a higher diversity of p. acnes phylotypes on the face vs. the back zone in both groups and phylotype ia1 was largely represented in the acne group especially in the back zone.analysis of multi-locus and single-locus sequence type determinationto go deeper in the analysis of p. acnes lineages involved in acne lesions 2 additional molecular typing methods were performed mlst and slst.

nd category represents the other species found instead of p. acnes where typing was not possible.distribution of p. acnes subgroups in patients with severe acne265p  0.001. moreover 16.6 of the back samples were cc28 corresponding to phylotype ia1 total absence of phylotype ii whereas 54.1 of the face samples were cc18 16.6 were cc28 and 8.3 were cc53 phy- lotype ii corresponding to k slst-types.

overall despite a highly conserved genome of p. acnes 26 we show that acne lesions are associated with the development of a specific subpopula- tion of p. acnes.from our 72 isolates the a1 slst-type was signifi- cantly associated with acne skin condition.

interestingly it has been shown that there is a direct link between hyperseborrhoea proliferation of p. acnes and onset of acne lesions 31. as the microbiota modulates the innate immunity of the skin 32 33 this loss of diversity could activate innate immunity trig- gering the development of inflammatory acne lesions.we also report differences in the pattern of p. acnes phylotypes between the back and face.

although this has not been investigated for p. acnes phylotypes 3 4.in culture we identified p. namnetense in 3 patients 2 minor acne face score 1 1 severe acne back score 3 which has not been described previously in acne and could lead to further investigations about the link bet- ween this bacterium and specific clinical forms of acne.

all patients and controls were positive for p. acnes or related species with our sampling method which is an important point at the methodological level compared with previous studies in which culture positivity was found in approximately 70-84 of patient samples 34 35. concerning the association between s. epidermidis and p. acnes we identified s. epidermidis in 50 of acne back samples 41.6 in healthy back and 75 of acne face samples 75 in healthy face data not shown respectively.
