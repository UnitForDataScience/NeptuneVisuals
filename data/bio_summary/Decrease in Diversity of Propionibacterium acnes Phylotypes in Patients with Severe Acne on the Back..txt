Instead of P. acnes other species were discovered including P. avidum in the healthy group 224 8.3 P. granulosum in the acne group 148 2.1 and P. namnetense in the acne group 348 6.3.

The change in balance of cutaneous P. acnes subgroups might be an inducing factor in the ac- tivation of P. acnes which could trigger inflammation.Key words acne P. acnes phylotypes clonal complexes SLST- types.Accepted Nov 13 2017 Epub ahead of print Nov 14 2017Acta Derm Venereol 2018 98 262-267.Corr Brigitte Dreno Department of Dermatology Nantes University Hos- pital 1 Place Alexis Ricordeau FR-44035 Nantes Cedex 01 France.

Colonies with the macroscopic morphology of P. acnes were picked from each plate to recover the predominant strain of P. acnes.

All strains were identified accurately with a value  99.9.DNA extraction and phylotype determinationTotal DNA from P. acnes isolates was extracted using the Insta- Gene Matrix method Bio-Rad Laboratories Hercules CA USA according to the manufacturer's instructions.The 6 main phylotypes for all isolates were determined as de- scribed previously 21.Multi- and single-locus sequence type determination and sequencing protocolMLST is a method to determine to which clonal complex a P. acnes strain belongs.

1.In conclusion there was a higher diversity of P. acnes phylotypes on the face vs. the back zone in both groups and phylotype IA1 was largely represented in the acne group especially in the back zone.Analysis of multi-locus and single-locus sequence type determinationTo go deeper in the analysis of P. acnes lineages involved in acne lesions 2 additional molecular typing methods were performed MLST and SLST.

ND category represents the other species found instead of P. acnes where typing was not possible.Distribution of P. acnes subgroups in patients with severe acne265p  0.001.

Concerning the face zone 33.3 of the strains were CC18 phylotype IA1 and A1 SLST-type and 33.3 were CC53 phylotype II including K1 and a new SLST-type named K16 whereas 16.6 were CC28 phylotypes IA1 and IA2 corresponding to D1 and F4 SLST-types and 16.6 were CC36 phylotype IB and H1 SLST-types Figs 3 and 4.Interestingly the only P. acnes phylotype III found in this study was recovered in the healthy group associa- ted with CC43 and a new SLST-type L7 not previously described.In acne group samples 58.3 of the P. acnes strains belonged to CC18 and 16.6 belonged to CC28 including SLST types A1 A5 C1 D1 and E3 Fig.

Overall despite a highly conserved genome of P. acnes 26 we show that acne lesions are associated with the development of a specific subpopula- tion of P. acnes.From our 72 isolates the A1 SLST-type was signifi- cantly associated with acne skin condition.

although this has not been investigated for P. acnes phylotypes 3 4.In culture we identified P. namnetense in 3 patients 2 minor acne face score 1 1 severe acne back score 3 which has not been described previously in acne and could lead to further investigations about the link bet- ween this bacterium and specific clinical forms of acne.

reviewed P. acnes molecular typing methods and pointed out the importance of investigating P. acnes populations in acne vulgaris 38.
