VM AP and MA were supported by Doctoral Fellowships from the International PhD Course in Life Sciences and Biotechnologies University of Sassari.together these findings unveil structure and role of the distal gut microbiota in sheep and open the way to further studies aimed at elucidating its connec- tions with management and dietary variables in sheep farming.IntroductionSheep farming is widespread worldwide for the purpose of meat milk skin andor wool production.

According to the specific productive purpose farmers select sheep breeds and traditionally efforts are continuously made to improve physicalgenetic traits that in turn ameliorate the production performances.Regardless of the genetic background and of the pro- duction purpose a correct nutritional management plays a crucial role in warranting healthy and fertile sheep and productive dairy ewes.

2015 but much less is currently known on the microbial populations that colo- nize the large intestine despite their crucial role in the sheep intestinal metabolism.As in other non-ruminant mammalian includinghumans the microbial population that colonizes the sheep large intestine is expected to be key in providing energy antigens and metabolites that positively affect host metabolism physiology and immunity.

To reach this aim we employed an integrated multi-omic strategy compris- ing 16S rDNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to unravel microbiota structure and genetic potential as well as metaproteomics to identify and characterize functions and pathways actively expressed by the sheep faecal microbial communities.Results and discussionOptimization of protocols for DNA extraction and sample clean-up for the analysis of the sheep faecal microbiotaStool is a complex sample matrix with regard to DNA extraction.

S1 in line with the above-stated observations.Focus on glycan import and degradation ABC transporters starch utilization system and glycosyl hydrolasesWe then examined functions responsible for import and degradation of glycans in view of the high content in glycans in the plant-based sheep diet and to evaluate the residual relevance of such activities in the sheep colon after the massive digestion of plant material per- formed in the rumen.First we focused on genes and proteins classified as ABC transporters especially those capable of transport- ing mono- and oligosaccharides which are listed in Table 2.

fungi and protists.These findings and the whole data set provided herecan be useful for deepening our understanding on orga- nization and role of the large intestine microbiota in small ruminants and pave the way to further studies investi- gating the relationship between gut microbiota dynamics and management and dietary variables key for sheep farming.Experimental proceduresAnimal description and faecal sample collectionFaecal samples were collected from the rectal ampulla of five lactating Sarda sheep in November 2012.

This study reports the first char- acterization of the sheep faecal microbiota composition and functions obtained through the application of a multi-omic strategy.

An optimized protocol was first devised for DNA extraction and amplification from sheep stool samples.

Under a taxo- nomic perspective the sheep faecal microbiota appeared globally comparable to that of other rumi- nants with Firmicutes being the main phylum.
