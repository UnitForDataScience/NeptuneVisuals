To explore this potential microbial involvement we evaluated the differences in biliary microbiota in PSC patients at an early disease stage without previous endoscopic retrograde cholangiography ERC examinations advanced disease stage and with biliary dysplasia or cholangiocarcinoma.DesignBile samples from the common bile duct were collected from 46 controls and 80 patients with PSC during ERC 37 with early disease 32 with advanced disease and 11 with biliary dysplasia.

We are not aware of any studies using modern high-throughput amplicon sequencing methodology to compare biliary microbiota of PSC patients and non-PSC subjects.In the present study we set out to explore the role of biliary microbiotain the etiopathogenesis of PSC by comparing non-PSC controls to newly diagnosed early- stage PSC patients ERC severity score  6in disease progression by comparing early-stage PSC patients to advanced-stage patients ERC severity score 2 6in the development of biliary dysplasia and cholangiocarcinoma CCA by comparing advanced-stage PSC patients to patients with dysplasiacarcinoma andthe overall relationship of microbiota and disease severity as measured with the ERC score.

This approach to low count taxa is conservative given that DESeq2 also performs automatic filtering using the mean of normalised counts.Three different statistical models were run in DESeq2A model in which the early stage PSC group contained only individuals referred for their first ERC examination for comparison 1 controls vs early stage PSC.A model that included all subjects with PSC status as a categorical variable for compari- sons 1 to 3 1. controls vs early stage PSC 2. early vs advanced stage PSC 3. advanced stage PSC vs dysplasiacarcinoma.A model with ERC score as a numerical descriptor of disease severity comparison 4.The second and third models included the number of ERC examinations as a numerical variable.

This assessment was performed to look for features suggesting that the taxa might be false positives such as 1 putative outliers 2 influential points with high leverage 3 very low mean abundances and 4 inconsistent abundance increase and decrease patterns across the groups that are difficult to explain as biologically significant.ResultsBased on the clinical results we classified the study subjects with PSC as follows 37 patients were at an early disease stage ERC severity score  6 32 at an advanced disease stage ERC severity score 2 6 and 11 had biliary dysplasiacholangiocarcinoma.

Our study subjects included patients with newly diagnosed PSC at their first ERC examination patients at an early disease stage but with a history of multiple ERC examinations patients with advanced biliary disease and those presenting with biliary neoplasia.

Streptococcus abundance was also positively correlated with an increase in disease severity even after controlling for the number of ERC examinations.design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the aetiology of PSC is not associated with changes in bile micro- bial communities but the genus Streptococcus may play a pathogenic role in the progres- sion of the disease.IntroductionPrimary sclerosing cholangitis PSC is a chronic inflammatory liver disease leading to stric- tures of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and finally to cholestasis and secondary biliary cirrhosis .

Finally a low abundance Prevotella OTU Otu00128 is reduced to zero abundance in the dysplasiacarcinoma group.Since previous ERC examinations could have had an effect on the biliary microbiome we looked at what taxa appear to be associated with the number of ERC examinations undergone by each patient.

The resulting taxa are the same for both the model where PSC patients are cat- egorized according to severity and the one where a numerical ERC score is used instead sug- gesting that the abundances of the genus Streptococcus and Streptococcus Otu00035 increase with additional ERC examinations .Finally we took the opportunity to assess the impact of IBD on bile bacterial communities in PSC.

Comparing the control patients and the early stage PSC patients at their first ERC examination reveals four OTUs an unclassified Enterobac- teriaceae OTU Otu0008 Neisseria Otu00045 Campylobacter Otu00089 and an unclassified Neisseriaceae OTU Otu00213 and three families Pasteurellaceae Staphylococcaceae and Xanthomonadaceae as differentially abundant with no genus-level results  .When contrasting the control group with the early disease group as a whole we obtain statisti- cal significance for two OTUs an unclassified Clostridiales Otu00188 and the same unclassi- fied Neisseriaceae as above Otu00213 and one family Staphylococcaceae  .Relative abundances  of bacteria in controls and patients at different stages of PSC.
