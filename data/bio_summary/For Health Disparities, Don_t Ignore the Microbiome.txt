For ex- ample suggests that differences in the composition of the vaginal microbiome may play a role in higher rates of bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth in African Ameri- can women relative to women of European ancestry.The authors called for investigators across disciplines--basic and computa- tional scientists clinicians social and behav- ioral scientists and epidemiologists--to col- laborate on health disparities research that takes into account the whole person in- cluding the microbiome.We mustuse all the tools at our disposal-- the study of genomics the human micro- biome and interactions with behavioral and social processes of health and disease--to better understand and find solutions to health disparities Vence L. Bonham Jr JD a coauthor on the perspective and associate investigator in NHGRI's Social and Behav- ioral Research Branch told JAMA.VHA Initiative Reduces Risky Opioid PrescribingIn October 2013 the Veterans Health Ad- ministration VHA implemented an audit and feedback program to reduce high- dose opioid prescriptions and potentially le- thal drug combinations at all 141 of its hos- pitals across the country.

The total number of patients receiving opioids also decreased from 571 476 to 514 883--a 10reduction--over the study period.Additionally 21 fewer patients were prescribed both opioids and benzodiaz- epines a decrease from 112 907 to 89 564 patients.

Genetic variation and differing expo- sures to environmental factors such as diet and stress may influence the microbial mi- lieu in and on the human body resulting in health disparities.For each of the aforementioned health problems there is evidence that micro- biome variations in different groups may contribute to disease disparities.

Over this study period the number of VHA patients prescribed daily opioid dos- ages of more than 100 morphine equiva- lents MEQ decreased 16 from 55 722 to 46 780 patients.

Clinical leaders were also encouraged to educate clinicians about pain care and opioid prescribing.The VA's experience with the OSI pro- vides a potential model for how to influ- ence prescriber behavior through system- level interventions said Mark Ilgen PhD lead author of the study.Public-Private Partnership Speeds Investigator Access to Cancer DrugsA new collaboration between pharma- ceutical and biotech companies and theThe microbiome may be an overlooked factor influencing health disparities.National Cancer Institute NCI at the Na- tional Institutes of Health aims to get can- cer drugs into the hands of researchers-- and patients--faster.

News  AnalysisFor Health DisparitiesDon't Ignore the MicrobiomeWhen considering health disparities among different groups look to the microbiome as a factor say researchers at the National Hu- man Genome Research Institute NHGRI part of the National Institutes of Health.

Chan School of Public Health and Perel- man School of Medicine introduced a new conceptual framework for human health and disease that integrates the micro- biome the social and physical environ- ment and biological processes.The authors noted that racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of conditions in- cluding asthma cardiovascular disease dia- betes obesity preterm birth and sickle cell disease may be caused by a host of factors ranging from genetics to lifestyle to pollu- tion.

A study in the journal suggests that effort--called the OSI--was a moderate success.The study led by researchers at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System and the Uni- versity of Michigan Medical School ana- lyzed data from all adult VHA patients who filled outpatient opioid prescriptions be- tween October 2012 and September 2014.

Patients receiving very high daily dose opioids 200 MEQ decreased 24 from 19 952 to 15 121 patients.
