factors possible contributing to the detected change in abundance of metabolites including amino acids nucleosides and bile acids are discussed below.metabolites of amino acidsmetabolites of multiple amino acids including phenylalanine tryptophan and glutamic acid differed in ab and untreatedtable 3. metabolites with different abundance between ab and untreated pigs nmrabundancefold changegroup withmetabolitemolecular formulachemical shift dppmmultiplicityabundance abx104untreatedx104abuntreatedq-valuehigherabundancebiofluidalaninec3h7no21.48d190 - 5154 - 81.20.002abplasmamannitolc6h14o63.7-4dd m d dd782 - 20642 - 171.20.004abplasmagalactosec6h12o64-4.05 5.25t d133 - 3107 - 41.30.0003abplasma4-hydroxyphenylacetic acidc8h8o37.17d17 - 0.315 - 0.6-1.10.07untreatedplasmaglycinec2h5no23.57s259 - 16140 - 561.80.09aburinemannitolc6h14o63.65-3.9dd m d dd12420 - 19214623 - 17612.70.02aburinekynureninec10h12n2o36.8d22 - 78 - 32.60.08aburinen-phenylacetylglycine methylhistidinekynurenine  hippuric acid1-methylnicotinamide hypoxanthine7.35ms26 - 415 - 31.80.05aburine7.8dd37 - 813 - 32.80.01aburine8.15-8.2tss26 - 316 - 31.60.04aburinen1-methylnicotinamidec7h9n2o8.9 8.97 9.28d d s42 - 429 - 61.50.08aburineamean - sem.figure 1. a median plasma spectra for untreated in blue and ab in red piglets.

in plasma three and one metabolite were found with higher and lower level in ab pigs respectively while all five metabolites identified in urine had higher levels in ab pigs.

ab pigs included in both plasma and urine collection showed lower incidence rate of nec fischer's exact test all p  0.01 as well as lower nec severity score than the untreated ones mann-whitney test all p  0.01. lower bacterial counts of both aerobes and anaerobes were observed in the cecum contents of ab pigs compared with the untreated pigs two-tailed t-test all p  0.001. recalculated nec incidence score and microbiological data are attached as .lc-ms and 1h nmrby lc-ms 31 and 61 exposure features in plasma were detected in negative and positive mode respectively while 210 and 648 urinary exposure features in negative and positive mode were observed.

n- acetylation of phenylalanine is a conjugation pathway catalyzed by n-acetyltransferases and shared by both mammals and bacteria for example in e. coli k12.the reduced n-acetyl-l- phenylalanine level in the urine of ab pigs may result from decreased bacterial formation and lower intestinal permeability as indicated by the lower ratio of lactulose and mannitol.catabolites of tryptophan in plasma from two different pathways were differentially affected in ab piglets b.kynurenine 3-hydroxykynurenine and nicotinamide from the kynurenine pathway and n1-methylnicotinamide a metabolite of nicotinamide showed increased levels in ab pigs whereas 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5-hiaa from the serotonin pathway decreased  .

kynurenine was detected in plasma by lc-ms and in urine only by nmr .differential plasma and urinary metabolomesamong the four compounds showing differential abundance in both plasma and urine 3-phenyllactic acid and 4-hydroxyphe- nylacetic acid from phenylalanine metabolism were found at lower levels in ab pigs while nicotinamide and residual mannitol showed higher levels in ab pigs.

hypoxanthine was also detected in a peak together with 1-methylnicotinamide at higher urinary level in ab pigs .metronidazole ampicillin and other ab-related metabolites were only observed in the ab pigs .

bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine increases the blood level of cholic acid while germ-free mice had a lower serum level of total bile acids than conventional ones.thus the relative difference in bile acids between ab and the untreated pigs found here can be attributed to several factors intestinal inflammation and overgrowth of intestinal bacteria in the untreated pigs andthe attenuation of the gut microbiome in ab pigs.

this underscores the need for further inves- tigation of metabolic and developmental consequences of antibiotic treatment in preterm neonates.associated contents supporting informationthe supporting information is available free of charge on the at doi .chemical standards used for metabolite verification of metabolite annotation in lc-ms number of features at different analytical steps in lc-ms-based approach antibiotics and their metabolites in plasma and urine detected by lc-ms antibiotics and their metabolites in plasma and urine detected by nmr unannotated features in plasma and urine detected by nmr compounds putatively annotated at level 2 by lc-ms- based approach compounds putatively annotated at level 3 by lc-ms-based approach nec incidence scores and microbiological data of sample selections pca score plots of nmr data author informationcorresponding authore-mail .

with the gut microbiome being extensively attenuated by the antibiotics bacterial metabolites of phenylalanine 3- phenyllactic acid 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid phenylacetylgly-cine and hydroxyphenylacetylglycine were reduced in ab pigs a. in anaerobic bacteria phenylalanine is converted into phenylpyruvic acid and then into phenylacetic acid and 3-phenyllactic acid a.phenylacetic acid is extensively conjugated with glycine in the liver to produce phenyl-figure 2. metabolic pathways of a phenylalanine and b tryptophan involving identified metabolites.

suppression of the gut microbiome by antibiotics is likely the cause for the reduced level in the ab pigs of phenylalanine metabolites tryptophan metabolites from the serotonin pathway and the secondary bile acids.

this regimen leaves it difficult to attribute altered metabolites to direct impact of the specific antibiotic used but makes it highly likely that direct metabolic effects may explain some of the changes observed.the current study has several strengths including the highly controlled treatments possibility of checking metabolites in each treatment group and a broad coverage of metabolites by the two technologies applied on both urine and plasma.

another contributing factor could be the increased intestinal perme- ability in the untreated pigs which allows passive diffusion of bile acids into the circulation without the need for the apical sodium bile acid transporter for active reabsorption.nucleoside metabolitesnucleoside metabolites namely pseudouridine hypoxanthine and inosine were identified at higher levels in urine of the untreated pigs .
