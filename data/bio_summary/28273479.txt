Furthermore N-of-1 trials will provide information on variations of biomarkers both within and between individuals and this will be important for identification of biomarkers that are truly predictive and can therefore be used for stratification of cohorts not included in the N-of-1 study.the so-called genome-scale metabolic model GEM can be used as a scaffold for integrative analysis with the objective to identify novel prognostic biomarkers that can assist in the advancement toward personalized and precision medicine.Challenges for Systems MedicineAdvancing systems medicine faces several challenges 1 the challenge of analyzing large datasets 2 the difficulties in iden- tifying mechanistic causes for many biomarkers and drug tar- gets 3 problems with translation from model systems to the clinic and 4 problems with sample heterogeneity.The detailed analysis underlying systems medicine results in generation of very large datasets generally referred to as big data.

the pentose phosphate pathway ensuring regeneration of NADPH used in glutathione metabolism.Through specification of the stoichiometry of the different re- actions in a metabolic network GEMs can be used for simulation of metabolic functions using the concept of flux balance analysis .

Thus a recent analysis demonstrated that with four different data types the resources required for data analysis are larger than the resources for data generation for only four datasets and the resource requirement for data analysis increases rapidly when more datasets are to be analyzed  .

transcriptome or proteome data from different tissues in large cohorts and detailed models that can be used for integrative analysis of such data.

Illustration of the Concept of Integrative Data Analysis Using Metabolic NetworksIllustration of how a metabolic map represented by a genome-scale metabolic model GEM can be used for integrative analysis of omics data e.g.

Even though machine-learning algorithms cannot directly provide mechanistic insight these algorithms still allow for providing clear connectivity between a very large num- ber of variables and these can then be used for follow-up studies with the objective of identifying the underlying mechanisms.The above-mentioned study like many other N-of-1 clinical tri- als included analysis of the gut microbiota as this has been shown to have a large impact on overall human metabolism aEUR .

More detailed analysis of metabolic alterations in different tissues is required for obtaining a mechanistic explanation for this finding and this will require both large datasets e.g.

Principles of Personalized MedicineIllustration of how analysis of big data obtained from detailed omics analysis of patient cohorts can result in detailed phenotyping and thereby lead to stratification of patients into different groups.

This resulted in the identification of mannose metabolism to be significantly altered in insulin-resistant patients and subsequent analysis of metabolomics from more than 1000 subjects could validate mannose as a novel biomarker for insulin resistance  .The above-mentioned studies are all examples of how sys- tems biology analysis of specific human tissues resulted in the identification of changes in specific parts of the metabolic network and these changes resulted in altered plasma metabo- lite levels.

This concept is already widely used for monitoring of triacylglycerides and cholesterols in the blood but analysis of blood chemistry could probably be used much more widely for diagnosis.
