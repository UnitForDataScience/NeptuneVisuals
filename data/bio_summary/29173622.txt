These results suggest that the indigenous microbiota was less affected by the RH conditions while the inoculated Salmonella would have been more affected by RH conditions leading to significant differences in mesophilic counts.Effect of fluctuating environmental conditions on Salmonella survival in growing plantsThe effect of fluctuating environmental conditions described in on the survival of Salmonella in baby lettuce was studied.

Along the 24 h changes in the RH temperature and lighting conditions were applied to simulate the fluctuating environmental conditions that occur in a greenhouse .To elucidate the effect of inoculum carrier on the survival of Salmonella on lettuce plants IW DW and BPW were compared under the environmental conditions described in .

This fact is important when selecting the protected cultivation system such as small or high tunnel channels or greenhouses that offer many advantages for example protection against adverse weather conditions .The effect of inoculum size on Salmonella survival in growing plants at high and low RH conditions was also studied.

Thus plants can be artificially contaminated for a better understanding of the survival of pathogenic microorganisms under exposure to in- dividual climate variables.0740-0020c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this study the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium was assessed on baby lettuce exposed to different climate conditions and experimental choices inoculum size inoculum carrier using environmental test chambers.

A 2 log units initial decrease was observed for inoculated Salmonella loads when plants were grown at 60 RH while Salmonella levels decreased approximately 1 log during the seven days period in inoculated plants grown at 85 RH A.

When lettuce plants were grown under fluctuating environmental conditions Salmonella survival was similar under both RH conditions.

Further research would be necessary to understand the characteristics of the plant under fluctuating conditions such as variation in water content and stomata opening.Effect of the inoculum carrier on Salmonella survival in growing plantsIn order to determine the impact of the inoculum carrier on the survivalgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms three different inoculum carriers were tested including irrigation water IW distilled water DW and buffered peptone water BPW.
