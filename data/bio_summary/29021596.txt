Using functional profiling methods the authors classified metabolic core pathways into universal microbiome-enriched and body site-enriched the latter being indicative of functional adaptation by the microbiota to a particular niche.

Finally the authors characterized microbial and functional variation over time at different body sites.ORIGINAL ARTICLE Lloyd-Price J. Mahurkar A. et al.

Integration into the CRISPR locus is mediated by the CRISPR integrase a heterohexameric complex of four Cas1 and two Cas2 proteins and requires integration host factor IHF however how the integration complex recognizes the CRISPR locus is unknown.

The authors observed that mutant Mrr1 a transcription factor that upregulates the multidrug efflux pump MDR1 gene strains also caused the overexpression of FLU1 a gene that encodesan efflux pump that confers histatin 5 resistance.

now report an expanded data set from the study comprising 1631 new metagenomes 2355 total from diverse bodysites at multiple time points in 265 individuals.

Strain-level metagenomic profiles revealed body site-specific subspecies clades and the authors were able to quantify species with phylogenetic diversity that were under-represented in isolate genomes.

In a recent study Wright Liu et al.

reported structures of the full CRISPR locus integration complex.
