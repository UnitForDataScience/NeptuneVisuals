this study demonstrates that antifungal therapy could promote the evolution of c. albicans strains that are resistant to host immune defences.original article hampe i. a. i. et al.

an acquired mechanism of antifungal drug resistance simultaneously enables candida albicans to escape from intrinsic host defenses.

albicans adapts to environmental changes particularly in response to stresses such as antifungal treatment.

found that an acquired mechanism of antifungal resistance also enabled escape of host intrinsic immunity.

integration into the crispr locus is mediated by the crispr integrase a heterohexameric complex of four cas1 and two cas2 proteins and requires integration host factor ihf however how the integration complex recognizes the crispr locus is unknown.

for example gain-of-function mutations in fungal transcription factors confer new phenotypes and are a common cause of antifungal resistance.

histatin 5 an antimicrobial peptide that is secreted in the saliva has fungicidal activity against c. albicans.
