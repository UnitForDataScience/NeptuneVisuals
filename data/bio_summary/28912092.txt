1. dietary macronutrient fat carbohydrate and protein compositions in the diabetic and control groups in total daily calorie intake.fact that while 78.0 of diabetic patients never had vigorous physical activities and only 49.0 of them had light or moderate physical activities 2e5 times per week 89.0 of healthy individuals had light or moderate physical activities 3e5 time weekly and 58.0 of them had vigorous physical activity 1e4 times per week all statistics and calculations on physical activity in the both pa- tient and healthy participants were calculated on a weekly basis.quantitative pcr analysis of bacterial groupsin this case-control study qpcr analysis were performed to evaluate the differences in composition of faecal microbiota in patients with t2dm and healthy individuals for lactobacillus bifi- dobacterium fusobacterium and prevotella groups.after removing the outliers intra-groups analysis indicated meaningful differences in abundance of two groups of bacteria between participants in the diabetic and healthy groups.observations related to quantification of bacterial genera were as followslactobacillus group the level of lactobacillus group was signif- icantly higher in the diabetic group compared to the healthy group p value  0.001.bifidobacterium group bifidobacterium group was significantly more frequent in the healthy individuals compared with the patient subjects p value  0.001.prevotella group no significant difference was observed in copy number of prevotella genus between the diabetic and healthy subjects although this bacterial group was relatively abundant in the diabetic group compared to the control group p value 0.08.fusobacterium group the quantity of fusobacterium was higher in the gut microbiota of t2dm group than that in healthy sub- jects though there was no significant changes in fusobacterium frequency between the two study groups p value 14 0.99.differences of intestinal bacterial genera in the study groups were represented in and and .the correlations between concentration of the bacterial species and body mass indexcorrelation analysis showed a tendency towards positive cor- relation between bmi and the quantity of lactobacillus group r 14 0.3 p-value 14 0.89 and fusobacterium group r 14 0.83 p- value 14 0.65 estimated by qpcr.

several studies showed that compositional changes in specific genera and species of intestinal bacteria in human or animal models may cause many chronic diseases such as diabetes obesity ibd cancer and autism e. study of murri and colleagues on t1d patients showed significant differences in the quantity of lactobacillus bifidobacterium prevotella clostridium and bacteroides genera and also firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria phyla between diabetic and control groups .in the current study we found that the level of lactobacillus group was significantly higher in the patients with diabetes compared to the healthy group.

given the observed changes in the complex microbial communities in patients with t2dm and the probable relationship between gut microbiota and t2dm this case-control study was designed to evaluate four faecal bacterial groups including lactobacillus bifidobacterium fusobacterium and prevotella in patients with t2dm compared to healthy controls using quantitative real time pcr method.materials and methodsstudy participants and samples collectionstool samples were obtained from 18 patients with t2dm aged56 - 8 years who referred to institute of endocrinology and metabolism research and training center iran university of med- ical sciences in tehran iran.

in 2010 compared the bacterial diversity profile in t2dm patients and non-diabetic subjects and did not find any significant differences in bacterial variety between the two groups however they noted the remarkable change in the counts of a few bacterial phyla genera and species .

this case-control study was designed to evaluate the composition of the gut microbiota dominant bacterial groups in patients with t2dm compared to the healthy people.

4. study bacterial groups differentiation between t2dm patients and non-diabetic controls.

this hypothesis was accepted in this study when the four faecal bacterial groups including lactobacillus bifido- bacterium prevotella and fusobacterium in t2dm patients were compared with those in their healthy counterparts.

3. bacterial groups quantified by probe taqman-real time qpcr and expressed as copy number of bacterial groups per gr stool in human adults with t2dm white boxes n 14 18 and healthy controls grey boxes n 14 18. boxes show the upper 75 and the lower 25 percentiles of the data.

thesecontroversial results regarding the change in gut bacterial composition in t2dm patients as well as contradictory findings on the relationship between various bacterial groups and bmi could be explained by the heterogeneity in various factors such as genetic background ethnicity geographical location environmental and occupational exposures medical history possible underlying dis- easesdisorders lifestyle and diet habits of subjects across studies.

demonstrated a meaningful positive correlation between fusobacterium and bmi however in the current study did not find any correlation between this bacterial genus and bmi in the study participants.

the bacterial concentration from each stool samples were calculated from the threshold cycle values ct obtained from the standard curves and expressed as quantity of bacteria per gram stool.bacterial standard strainsbacterial standard strains used in this study were obtained from the american type culture collection atcc bifidobacterium bifi- dum atcc 29521 lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 fusobacte- rium nucleatum atcc 25586 prevotella intermedia atcc 25611d-5.statistical analysisstatistical analysis was performed using spss version 20.0 software spss inc. chicago il usa and minitab version 16.2.0. the sample size was calculated based on a predicted difference of at least 2 105 copies per gram of feces in the mean bacterial numbers between the healthy individuals and those with type 2 diabetes.

the significant alterations in dominant faecal bacterial genera found in t2dm patients participating in the current study highlight the link between t2dm disease and compositional variation in intestinal flora.

the correlations between count of the bacterial genera and bmi were shown in .in the present study it was proposed that intestinal microbiota composition in adult patients with type 2 diabetes is different from control subjects.

the most important nutrients consumed in diabetic and control groups are presented in .ipaq analysisanalysis of the physical activity questionnaires in two groups showed main differences in their life style patterns due to the lower physical activity score in diabetic group.

further studies are needed to illuminate the change in other bacterial groups in t2dm patients to make clearer the relationship between intestinal microbiota and the disease.
