Genome-wide association analysis identifies vari- ation in vitamin D receptor and other host factors influencing the gut microbiota.

If quantitative trait loci QTLs that causally influ- ence gut microbiotal compositions are detected our goal to pin-point host genomic factors causally influencing microbiotal compositions can be fur- thered by constructing and comparing congenic strains or genetically modified strains with appro- priate control strains that are identical in genomic background throughout the genome except for the QTL region.Questions on the mechanisms by which gut mi- crobiota impact hypertension are drawing focused attention to the view that the gut along with its microbiota serve as a central node interacting with multiple other organs whereby the connec- tions are referred to as axes interacting with the node.

A concerted systems biology approach exploring microbiome-metagenomics- metabolomics is lacking to delineate how the mi- crobiome could causally impact hypertension.Although technology may no longer be a limiting factor for querying microbiota or their metabolites there are other perceivable technical difficulties to study the gut microbiota such as the inability to culture all the gut bacteria in the laboratory whereby the bacteria cultured and studied in the laboratory may not be entirely representative of what is present in the gut.

Newer functions of gut microbiota are being discovered due to the obser- vations that they contribute importantly to the pathophysiology of a variety of disorders such as obesity colitis inflammatory diseases metabolic syndrome liver disease and kidney disease 3 7 811-17 19 20 29 31 33-37 46 55 57 59 64 65 6972 75-77 80 86 94 96 97 100 103 107 108112-114 116 119 120 122 125 128 131 133.Gut Microbiota the Host Genome and HypertensionA study reported using toll-like receptor 5 Tlr5 knockout mice was among the first to describe the relationship between the host genome gut micro- biota and BP regulation.

Taken together although these studies suggest that the changes in the gut microbiota observed in the Tlr5-- mice are likely to be a contributing factor in the development of metabolic syndrome in the mice it remains to be formally tested to see whether this is indeed the case with BP.Since this study was reported other groups have obtained evidence for additional but functionally different receptors on the host genome that also interact with gut microbiota to regulate BP.
