One host benefit that is certain to be of particular interest to clini- cians is the impact of the microbiota in pre- venting invasion by exogenous pathogens.The study published by van der Veer et al  in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases investigates the potential associ- ation between a woman's cervicovaginal microbiota CVM and her likelihood of acquiring genital infection after exposureReceived 30 August 2016 accepted 2 September 2016.

Other mechanisms by which some lactobacilli prevent pathogen invasion but which evidence suggests are not equally shared by all Lactobacillus species are the production of antimicrobial molecules including hydrogen peroxide acetic acid bacterio- cins and biosurfactants and by immuno- modulation via host cell production of both proinflammatory and anti-inflam- matory cytokines .Like all studies the one by van der Veer and colleagues  has limitations.

Based on multivariate anal- ysis they found C. trachomatis infection to be significantly associated with a CVM predominated by either diverse anaerobes odds ratio OR 4.2 95 confidence interval 1.2-15.4 or L. iners OR 4.4 1.3-15.6 in a comparison with women who had L. crispatus-dominated CVMs.That the findings of van de Veer and colleagues implicate both a diverse com- munity of anaerobic species as well as anL.

However the veracity of this infer- ence is limited because their study design relied on a single sampling time point.32  CID 201764 1 January  EDITORIAL COMMENTARYThus their methods are unable to resolve unambiguously whether the CVM state identified at the time of contact tracing ac- curately represents the CVM state that ex- isted before exposure to C. trachomatis.

Consequently we now recognize that the human body is home to trillions of mi- crobes that mediate complex interactions to provide numerous benefits for their human host including immune system programming and nutrient extraction among others .
