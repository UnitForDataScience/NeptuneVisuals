One possible explanation for these variations is the premise that different niches in the oral cavity are populated by different bacterial speciesand that the oral microbiome is not a single entity but comprises different sub-populations .Previous studies conducted using bacterial cultur- ing techniques have suggested that despite their small representation in the oral cavity Enterobacteriaceae were responsible for the characteristic malodour ema- nating from malodourous dentures .

Microbiome diversity analysis Shannon diversity index demonstrated statistically significant higher diversity p0.008 Mann- Whitney in the malodour samples as compared with the non-malodour ones figure .The common bacterial species based clustering analysis shown in figure demonstrates two distinct clusters one that comprises 75 malodour positive samples 1216 left-hand side figure  and anotherthat comprises 80 non-malodourous samples 810 right-hand side figure .DiscussionOur ability to study the complex microbial population of the oral cavity has been limited by our inability to cultivate and therefore identify most of the oral microorganisms.

There is clear evidence of bacteria in the oral cavity especially late colonizers and anaerobics to relyon other bacteria residing in the outer layers of the bio- film for metabolism and growth by providing for exam- ple oxygen depletion and mucin deglycosylation .Furthermore clustering analysis relying on core species demonstrated two separate clusters one dom- inantly representing the malodour group and another comprised mainly of non-malodour subjects.Within the limitation of the present study focusing on the microbiome of dentures malodour and less on the overall clinical parameters of all the clinical parameters measured in the present study regarding health status and denture age and condition only denture hygiene practice showed any association with the absence of den- ture malodour even ill-fitting ones.

In the present study we employed this novel approach to study and revisit the subject of denture microbiome specifically with relation to denture malodour a growing field with the rise in life expectancy.Results of the present study show several differ- ences characterizing the microbial populations asso- ciated with malodourous dentures as compared with non-malodourous ones both in composition and diversity.

The metabolic activity of proteolytic anaero- bic oral bacteria has been associated with oral malodour production.

However despite the overall consensus among researchers and clinicians that denture malodour plays a part in oral malodour pro- duction it is still unclear as to what extent this warrants further study.AcknowlegementsThis work was performed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for an MSc degree of Shai Yitzhaki Goldschleger School of Dental Medicine Sackler Faculty of Medicine Tel Aviv University Israel.ORCID iDsN StererReferencesBornstein M M Kislig K Hoti B B Seemann R and Lussi A 2009 Prevalence of halitosis in the population of the city of Bern Switzerland a study comparing self-reported and clinical data Eur.
