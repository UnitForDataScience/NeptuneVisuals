Microbial communities were similar in PSC patients with and with- out IBD.23 While the gut microbial profile in patients with PSC is distinct from patients with UC without biliary disease and healthy controls another study assessing microbiota obtained from mucosal samples found an enrichment of Blautia and Barnesiellaceae.24 Fur- thermore several observations support the gut microbiota being directly involved in the pathogenesis of PSC with animal models of small bacterial overgrowth showing PSC-like changes in the liver which can be counteracted by antibiotics and cultured cholangio- cytes from patients with PSC that seem hypersensitive to PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide LPS.

The authors prospectively assessed the gut microbiota of all patients in the pre-transplant period and noted a marked increase in E. coli in those patients with HCC com- pared with those with cirrhosis without HCC.27 Patients were similar in age and sex and were matched according to aetiology of cirrhosis and model for end-stage liver disease scores.

This is further exacerbated by underlying portal hypertension and endothelial dysfunction28 while portosys- temic shunting increases the delivery of these bacterialTABL E 1 Summary of changes in gut microbiota in liver diseaseHealthBacteroidetes and Firmicutes ActinobacteriaCirrhosisReduced autochthonous bacteria such as LachnospiraceaeRuminococcus and Clostridiales XIV and increased pathogenic species eg Enterobacteriaceae Staphylococcaceae and EnterococcaceaeSalivary dysbiosis has also recently been reported to be present in patients with cirrhosis with an associated systemic and buccal pro-inflammatory milieu.40 Salivary dysbiosis was more pronounced in over a third of cirrhotic patients that went on to require liver- related hospital admissions during the 90-day follow-up period suggesting that saliva may play a key role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and tempering oxidative stress.

With rising rates of obesity the issue of NAFLD is becoming more and more pressing especially as there are currently no effective drug treatments for the condition.Gut microbiota have been implicated in the development of obe- sity and the metabolic syndrome.8 Germ-free mice who were fed a high-fat high-sugar diet gained less weight than ordinary mice fed the same diet.9 Germ-free mice were then given gut microbiota from normal mice resulting in increased body fat.

Mice treated with the metabolic syndrome gut microbiota developed raised blood glucose and insulin levels and evidence of hepatic steatosis suggest- ing that the metabolic syndrome phenotype can be transferred via transfer of stool microbiota.10Gut microbiota produce SCFAs such as acetate propionate and butyrate from digestion of carbohydrates in the colon.

The mice who received microbiota transplants from the non-AAH donor gained significantly more weight than those who received microbiota from the severe AAH donor.

Parasutterella excrementihominis was found to make up 8.56 of non-AAH mouse microbiota but represented only 0.001 in severe AAH donors and was absent in severe AAH-treated mouse microbiota suggestive of a possible protective effect from this bacteria.Metabolites in severe AAH-treated mice were also differentwith alterations in bile acid composition.

Faecal microbiota transplantationFaeces from healthy volunteers FMT have been used with excellent success rates in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection to re-popu- late the gut with healthy intestinal flora and are approved by NICE in the UK for this indication Faecal microbiota transplant for recur- rent C. difficile infection Interventional procedures guidance IPG485 Published date March 2014.

Direct manipulation of the microbiota without drugs may be achieved via probiotic or synbiotic therapy or eventually whole microbiota transplants in the form of FMT.

Salivary microbiota reflects changes in gut microbiota in cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy.
