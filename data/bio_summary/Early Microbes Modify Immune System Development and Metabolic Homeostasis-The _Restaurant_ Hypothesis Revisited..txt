Additional studies   have suggested that maternal obesity can alter early gut microbes in the offspring although factors such as antibiotic use cesarean section delivery and weight gain during pregnancy might confound maternal obe- sity as a factor impacting early offspring microbiota composition.

Given that inoculation of obese human or obese mouse microbiota to germ-free GF mice alters the assembly of their intestinal microbiome in a manner that favors adipogenesis and inflammation - modifications to the structure of the infant intestinal microbiome by maternal obesity is plausible and might carry similar metabolic risk to the infant.ORiginS OF THe gUT MiCROBiOTACurrent data suggest that the microbiome might begin to assemble earlier in development than previously thought.

maternal obesity or diabetes or maternal diet can also modify disease risk by altering the glycobiome of human milk.ROLe OF THe MiCROBiOTA in innATe iMMUniTYHow the early microbiome impacts the immune system in the short- and long-term remains a critical concern.

A recent murine study reported that reversal of dysbiosis induced by maternal HFD and resulting pathologies might be possible by bacterial supplementation of defined microbial species in the offspring early in development but not later in life .

Therefore there seems to be a distinct microbial community indicative of NAFLD rather than solely of obesity which might suggest more specific microbial mechanisms that promote NASH.Supporting the idea that prebiotics can be therapeutic is a study showing that bovine milk oligosaccharides prevented HFD-associated increases in gut permeability dysbiosis and obesity in mice .

In a murine model oral administration of acetate during pregnancy was sufficient for the priming of FoxP3 regulatory T cells and preventing allergic airway inflammation in the adult offspring  suggesting that in utero exposure to maternal gut microbial metabolites contributes to the development of immune function in the offspring.

This study also found that maternal HFD changed the microbial profile in offspring significantly lowering the microbial biodiversity within a sample .Highlighting the role of microbiota in the development of NAFLD is a recent study in mice showing that HFD-induced NASH can be attenuated by fecal transplant from chow-fed donors as evidenced by a decrease in liver adiposity and decreased inflammatory cytokines .

While many factors alter the microbiome throughout life the early infant pattern of microbiome development can have life-long implications for disease risk   and the timing and dynam- ics of bacterial colonization later in development.

The early infant gut microbiome varies in association with a maternal high-fat diet.

This review will focus on factors during pregnancy and the neonatal period that impact a neonate's gut microbiome as well as the mechanisms and possible links from early infancy that can drive increased risk for diseases including obesity and NAFLD.
