Furthermore studies involving microbiota transplantation from obese to lean mice have shown that the obese phenotype is transmissible and may be promoted by microbiota that have increased capacity to harvest energy from the host diet .

The authors demonstrated that these findings are at least partly due to differences in gut microbiota between the two groups transplantation of microbiota from one group to the other after antibiotic administration not only enriched the transplant recipi- ent's gut with dominant genera from the donor species but also replicated the donor's inflammatory and meta- bolic phenotypes.

Recently it has been shown that microbiota can effectively be subdivided into different enterotypes each enriched by particular bacterial genera but that all seem to share high functional uniformity .

Additionally studies conducted using germ-free mice suggest that the micro- biota directly promote local intestinal immunity through their effects on toll-like receptor TLR expression  antigen presenting cells differentiated T cells and lym-phoid follicles   as well as by affecting systemic immunity through increased splenic CD4 T cells and systemic antibody expression .These recorded benefits and more have led to growing interest in the ability to modify the gut microbiota.

The gut microbiota of patients with type 2 diabetes has been functionally characterized with diabetes-associated markers showing enriched mem- brane transport of sugars and branched-chain amino acids xenobiotic metabolism and sulphate reduction along with decreased bacterial chemotaxis butyrate syn- thesis and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins .

Risk of athero- sclerosis has similarly been linked to the gut microbiota in particular due to enhanced metabolism of cholineand phosphatidylcholine that produces the proathero- genic compound trimethylamine-N-oxide TMAO .

Studies describing the relationship between specific dietary com- ponents and intestinal microbiota composition ranged from subject number n  3 to n  344 with a majority of studies clustered around subject number n  20 toStudy designs were primarily randomized controlled trials cross-sectional studies case-control studies and in vitro studies.

In addition to human studies several animal studies were also included to demonstrate dietary impact on the microbiome under controlled experimen- tal conditions.Diet and microbiotaProteinThe effects of dietary protein on the gut microbiota were first described in 1977.
