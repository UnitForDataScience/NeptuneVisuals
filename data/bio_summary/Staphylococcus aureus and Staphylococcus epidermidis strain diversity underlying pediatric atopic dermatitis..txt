D In principal component PC analysis clades A20 A29 and A30 drive separation between S. epidermidis-predominant AD patients and healthy adults.Strains elicit differential cutaneous immune responses in a murine modelWhereas S. aureus has been tightly linked with AD it is still debated whether S. aureus is a cause or effect that is whether S. aureus can elicit andor worsen AD skin disease or is a bystander that flourishes with increased access to extracellular matrix or other products of inflamma- tion in eczematous skin 36 37.

On the basis of standard sensitivity testing methods and whole-genome sequencing analysis five of the six S. aureus isolates from the more severe AD pa- tients were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus MSSA consistent with high- er incidences of MSSA than methicillin-resistant S. aureus MRSA cultivated from AD patient skin 29-31.Comparative genomic analysis of these six S. aureus strains revealed extensive heterogeneity in the gene content as predicted on the basis of the initial mapping of the shotgun metagenomics sequences to disparate phylogenetic clades.

Our findings demonstrate that AD skin flares in patients with more severe disease are tightly linked with clonal S. aureus isolates.In addition to characterizing strain communities during the course of AD we found that less severe AD patients were colonized with more methicillin-resistant strains whereas the more severe AD patients were primarily colonized with methicillin-sensitive strains.

The variation in the clonal S. aureus clades colonizing AD patients raises the possibility that this heterogeneity may contribute to the differential course andor therapeutic responses of AD patients.To confirm our strain tracking results we used a complementary approach in which SNVs were identified in the S. aureus core genome 1.9 Mbp shared between all sequenced S. aureus.

aureus relative abundances based on sequencing was variable 3 of 11 patients had no S. aureus on their skin and 3 of 11 patients had relative abundances of S. aureus on their skin exceeding 50 similar to prior studies of S. aureus relative abundances on AD skin 6 24 25.

We individually tested 10 phylogenetically distinct S. aureus isolates 6 S. aureus isolates cultivated directly from the flared skin of patients with more severe flares 2 S. aureus isolates from the skin of the less severe patient AD07's flare time point 1 S. aureus isolate from a healthy control and 1 common pathogenic S. aureus USA300 FPR3757 isolate high- lighted in red in fig.

In the con- text of prior studies demonstrating cutaneous immunologic responses to skin commensals 38 39 and exacerbation of eczematous skin in AD mouse models by S. aureus 38 39 49 50 our findings demonstrate that staphylococcal strains may play an important role in AD disease progression in a strain-specific manner.Here we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to examine strain- level microbial compositions of AD skin coupled with whole-genome sequencing of patient isolates.

Specifically more severe AD flare patients had relative abundances of 34 - 8.7 S. aureus with 7.4 - 4.2 S. epidermidis and less severe AD flare patients had relative abundances of 3.8 - 1.7 S. aureus with 13 - 3.9 S. epidermidis averaged across all sites during flare.

aureus strains in AD demonstrate monoclonality Although the differential association of S. aureus and S. epidermidis with AD severity defined an intriguing feature of disease heterogeneity the underlying strain communities of these species during the disease course remained unknown.

With a targeted search enterotoxin genes previously shown to exacerbate AD 32 were differentially present in the six AD patient strains of S. aureus variable presence of toxin genes isa trend con- sistent across S. aureus genomes 33.
