Habu D. Physical inactivity and insuffi- cient dietary intake are associated with the frequency of sarcopenia in patients with compensated viral liver cirrhosis.

Alcohol and acetaldehyde can also impair muscle fi- bers function by generating protein adducts with muscle membranes 115.Non-alcoholic Fatty LiverAlthough advanced liver disease is generally associated with the loss of muscle mass the growing epidemiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH has recently changed this paradigm.

The gastrointestinal dysfunction of cirrhotic patients results in inadequate nutrients intake and is responsible for muscle weakness thus limiting physical exercise and perpetuating the reduction of muscle mass.

Interestingly a role of intestinal bacteria in maintaining muscle health has been hypothesized through the translocation of bacteria and bacterial products into the bloodstream triggering the production of muscle wasting-related cytokines.Sarcopenia is associated with severe outcomes in patients with liver cirrhosis mostly due to the incidence of disease complications.

Finally the systemic pro-inflammatory status triggered by the alteration of the gut microbiota and the increased intestinal permeability may also contrib- ute to the pathogenesis of cirrhosis-associated sarcopenia.found in muscle of cirrhotic patients 26 was shown to in- volve also the whole body protein turnover 27-29.As a consequence of the metabolic impairment associated with liver cirrhosis fatty acids oxidation ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis are enhanced and proteinsamino acids me- tabolism is altered with a continuous breakdown of adipose and muscle tissue components not counteracted by oral feeding Fig.

How-ever recommendations about exercising in decompensated cirrhotic patients need a careful evaluation because in condi- tion of nutrients deficiency physical activity may cause pro- tein catabolism and loss of muscle mass as well as the wors- ening of renal function 55.Hormonal AlterationsSkeletal muscle growth is regulated by several hormonal stimuli.

Weight gain and muscle loss often coexist in these patients and recent data have suggested that muscle wasting can precede the development of cirrhosis and evolve together with liver impairment 116.

In particular in the pre-MELD score era when less strict criteria were adopted for patients selection 8 increased risk of death per unit decrease in transversal psoas muscle thickness per height was observed increasing to 14 in the MELD era when patients with more severe liver impairment received liver transplant.
