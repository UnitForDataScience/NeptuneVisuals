The BMI was classified into categories of underweight BMI  18.5 normal 18.5  BMI  23 overweight 23  BMI  25 and obese BMI  25 accord- ing to the revised Asia-Pacific BMI criteria by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region  Underweight subjects were excluded from this study n  41 Fig.

The large sample sizes in epidemi- ologic studies will provide increased statistical power and help to reveal significant findings involved with human- associated microbiota .Here we examined the correlation between the gut microbiota and body mass index BMI in relatively large sample size of Asian population.

This sug- gests there is a signature bacterium for the obesity that has no relation with dietary intake.DiscussionRecent human microbiome project studies have linked hu- man gut microbes to obesity proving the evidence that gut microbiota plays an important role in the harvesting stor- age and expenditure of energy obtained from diet  Our cross-sectional study aimed to identify differences in human gut microbiota associated with BMI in a large-scale metagenome cohort controlled by diet intake information.Our results like those of many others do not support the hypothesis that an increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes may make a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of obesity.

The distance from normal group was significant greater in obese than overweight group.Functional differences of gut microbiota in BMI groups PICRUSt analysis identified that 'Energy Metabolism' and 'Metabolism of Cofactors and Vitamins' genes were over- represented according to BMI increase as the comparison of obese vs. normal groups Fig.

This result was also true for the three-group comparison of the normal overweight and obese groups in which the immune- related pathways get over-represented with ascending BMI level Additional file Table S2.Taxonomic comparison by BMIA genus-level representation of the three BMI categories was assessed by metagenomeSeq with sequence count data as a dependent variable and BMI as a categorical independ- ent variable and with controlling of confounding factors.Statistical analysis using sequence-counting data is challenged by the assumption of normal distribution.
