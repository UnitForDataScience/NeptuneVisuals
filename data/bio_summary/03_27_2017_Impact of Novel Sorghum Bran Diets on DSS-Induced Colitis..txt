Further classification of the microbiome and a metabolomics profile will help elucidate the mechanisms by which bioactive compounds in sorghum bran may alter the luminal environment and mitigate UC.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at  Table S1 Assay ID for selected gene targets Table S2 Mean body weight g of rats measured throughout the study Table S3 Intake g24 h of rats measured prior to DSS1 Day 34 following DSS2 Day 56 and following DSS3 Day 77 Table S4 Fecal SCFA excretion umol24 h measured on Days 44 66 and 72 in rats treated with water control or DSS to induce colitis and consuming diets containing either cellulose or brans from Black Sumac or Hi Tannin Black bran Table S5 Relative expression of selected gene targets 2-Ct in scraped colon mucosa from rats treated with water control or DSS to induce colitis and consuming diets containing either cellulose or brans from Black Sumac or Hi Tannin Black sorghums as the fiber source.1 Expression levels were normalized to 18S gene expression.Acknowledgments Research support from the United Sorghum Checkoff Program Roo31A-09 and HVM006-12 and the NIHNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Grant P30 DK34987.

On Day 33 prior to DSS1 we observed a slightly lower food intake in cellulose DSS rats compared to Sumac DSS rats p  0.05 however there were no significant differences in intake for any experimental groups on Day 56 post DSS2 or Day 77 post DSS 3 Table S3.Fecal moisture content in bran-fed rats i.e.

However Sumac control rats had a significantly higher index than Hi Tannin Black rats that were treated with DSS which caused a 60 reduction relative to the Hi Tannin Black rats in the control group p  0.0208 Table .Nutrients 2017 9 3308 of 20Table 3.

In DSS rats Day 81 the proportion of excreted butyrate was lower in Sumac bran rats 9 compared to cellulose Black or Hi Tannin Black bran rats 19 23 15 respectively on a wet weight basis umolg which is similar to the values observed prior to DSS exposure Figure .Figure 2.

Linear regression was calculated for the change in colonic injury and mucosal NF-kB activity between control rats not treated with DSS and DSS-treated rats.ResultsBody Weight Intake and Fecal Moisture ContentWe hypothesized that feeding sorghum bran diets would attenuate the effects of DSS-induced UC in rats.

The Hi Tannin Black bran control rats weighed more on Day 37 p  0.03 Day 39 p  0.03 Day 53 p  0.03 and Day 58 p  0.04 than the cellulose control rats Table S2.

Cellulose control rats had lower injury scores than Black bran controls p  0.05 Figure A. DSS treatment elevated injury scores in all groups with significantly higher scores observed in Hi Tannin Black and Sumac bran rats compared to their diet matched controls p  0.0072.

DSS-treated rats fed bran diets had significantly higher injury scores compared to cellulose DSS rats p  0.05.

DSS  dextran sodium sulfate.DSS-treated rats for all diets had shorter crypt heights compared to the diet-matched control rats p  0.05 Table .

The combination of insoluble fiber with polyphenols tended to elevate the proliferative index and zone in DSS rats whereas DSS tended to lower the proliferative index and zone for rats receiving the cellulose diet.
