This indicates that some species that did not have decreased bacterial alpha diversity in captivity such as the anteaters and aardvarks still differed in terms of bacterial composition andor relative abundance of various bacterial taxa.

Four mammal families had no significant change in bacterial diversity between the wild and captive state Bovidae P 0.55 Giraffidae P 0.81 Myrmecophagidae P 0.358Orycteropodidae P0.448.To examine whether the gut bacterial commun- ities of mammals shift significantly in captivity we compared changes in beta-diversity in the captive versus wild state.

Overall a clear pattern that emerged was a decrease in bacterial di- versity for the primates in this study wherein four out of five primate families had significantly reduced gut bacterial diversity in captivity and the remaining family gorillas trended toward lower diversity  .

Though rhinoceros had increased bacterial alpha diver- sity overall the reduced abundance of these bacteria in captivity is potentially related to diet changes in captivity.Within the bacterial phylum Firmicutes captivemammals demonstrate markedly higher anaerobic Bacilli and lower relative abundance in Clostridia as compared to their wild counterparts.

The Equidae had marginally significantly decreased bacterial diversity in the captive state P 0.061 and the Hominidae gorillas trended toward decreased bacterial diversity P 0.101.

.A contrasting example to the ungulates is repre- sented by the two myrmecophagous ant- and termite-eating species aardvark and giant anteater that did not show significant differences in bacterial alpha diversity but did have differences in beta- diversity of the bacterial communities between captive and wild individuals  .

The full list of these bacterial taxa including those not expli- citly discussed can be found in the supplemental material Supplementary Tables S5-S6.Within the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes a fewtaxa of interest stand out.

Animals living in captivity experience a range of changes that may influence the gut bacteria such as diet changes treatments and reduced contact with other individuals species and variable environmental substrates that act as sources of bacterial diversity.

Second the few previous studies that directly compared captive to wild counterparts within a species suggest a trend towards reduced sym- biotic bacterial diversity in captivity      which leads to a number of questions.

One family Rhinocerotidae had significantly increased bacterial di- versity in captivity P 0.0028.
