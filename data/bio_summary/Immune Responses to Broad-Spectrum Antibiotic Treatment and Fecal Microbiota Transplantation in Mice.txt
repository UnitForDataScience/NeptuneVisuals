hence neither broad-spectrum antibiotic treatmentnor fmt results in increased intestinal apoptosis whereas reconstitution with complex intestinal microbiota is essential for restoring cell proliferative and regenerative measures during physiological tissue turnover within the intestinal tract.impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and subsequent fmt on innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in murine small and large intestines in situto examine the impact of the intestinal microbiota on abun- dances of distinct immune cell populations in the small and large intestines we microscopically quantitated respective immune cell subsets in small intestinal and colonic paraffin sections applying in situ immunohistochemistry.

remarkably cd8 cell numbers were reduced in the colon upon antibiotic treatment and fmt was not sufficient to restore this immune cell subset.

given that the alteration of the intestinal micro- biota composition termed dysbiosis is associated with defined immunopathological conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases   allergies  type 2 diabetes mellitus  obesity anxiety depression  and autism  the orchestrated interplay between the commensal microbiota and host cells plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis and host cell physiology.this rationale is further supported by compelling evidence derived from studies with defined bacterial strains that induce the development and expansion of distinct immune cell subsets.

hence our data underline the essential association of the complex commensal microbiota and the repertoire of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in both the small and large intestines.impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and subsequent fmt on distinct lymphocyte populationsin murine intestinal and systemic compartmentsto further elaborate the role of the intestinal microbiota on adaptive immunity in mucosal peripheral and systemicfigure 4  continuedcompartments we isolated lymphocytes of the small and large intestinal lp mln and spleen and analyzed defined immune cell populations by flow-cytometric analysis.

in the intestinal tract but also has far-reaching consequences on systemic immune functions.impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and subsequent fmt on memoryeffector t cells treg and activated dc in murine intestinal and systemic compartmentswe next surveyed the impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and fmt on defined t cell subsets and on the activationstatus of distinct cell populations.

for instance a decline of cd4 cd8 and b220 cell numbers in the small and large intestinal lp following antibiotic therapy was conversely associated with an increase of the respective immune cell populations in the spleen pointing toward a possible centralization of lymphocytes due to missing interactions with bacterial antigens in the intestinal tract.

moreover our data suggest an inverse relationship of the mentioned lymphocytic cell subsets between colon and spleen atdifferent time points post-fmt given that a colonic decrease of cd4 and b220 cells was conversely paralleled by an increase of the respective cell types at day 28 post-fmt in the spleen.

together with data showing long-lasting consequences of antibiotic therapy on the human gut ecosystem   these findings emphasize the need for considering long-term effects on immunity in patients undergoing antibiotic treatment.strikingly recolonization with complex intestinal microbiota could not sufficiently recover cd8 cell numbers in the colonic lp suggesting that antibiotic treatment affects this cell population through commensal-independent mechanisms.

t cell receptor- mediated activation of cd4cd44hi t cells bypasses bcl10 an implication of differential nf-kappab dependence of naive and memory t cells during t cell receptor-mediated responses.

restoration of the intestinal microbiota by peroral fecal microbiota transplantation fmt led to rees- tablishment of small intestinal cd4 cd8 and b220 as well as of colonic cd4 cell numbers as early as 7 days post-fmt.

however at d28 following fmt colonic cd4 and b220 cell numbers were comparable to those in secondary abiotic abx mice.

splenic changes in the immune cell repertoire that could at least in part be restored upon fmt.

remarkably even short-term application of antimicrobial compounds such as clindamycin induces long-lasting decreases in enteric microbialdiversity and renders mice susceptible to c. difficile colonization and infection .furthermore there is profound evidence regarding the impact of antibiotic treatment on immune cell homeostasis.

to address this we performed a comprehensive survey of distinct immune cell subsets including cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes b lym- phocytes memory t cells activated dendritic cells dc and treg in intestinal and systemic compartments of mice that were virtually depleted of microbiota through broad-spectrum anti- biotic treatment as compared to secondary abiotic abx mice following fecal microbiota transplantation fmt and to conven- tionally colonized mice.
