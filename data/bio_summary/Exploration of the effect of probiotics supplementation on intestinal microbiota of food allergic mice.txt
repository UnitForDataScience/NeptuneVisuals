The results indicated that BB treatment may change immune indexes of food allergy through modu- lation of these OTUs.Treatment with BB shows no effect on alpha- diversity of intestinal microfloraChao 18 and ACE 19 are usually used to compute community richness the higher score the more richness.

The present study supports the theory that probiotics can treat food allergy by modulating specific genera of the gut microbiota.Keywords Intestine microbiota food allergy OVA 16S rRNAIntroductionFood allergy is an adverse immune response to certain kinds of food.

The re- sults indicated that BB was not strong enough to change population diversity and rich- ness of intestinal microbiota.BB didn't alter intestinal mi- crobiota compositon in miceFigure 4.

Balbc mice were treated with PBS Naive group OVACT FA group OVACTBB FAPro group.

Among them only 4 KOs were enriched in FAPro group TableComparison of OTUs levels between FA andFAPro miceNext Wilcoxon rank test showed that 92 OTUs were significantly different between FA group and FAPro group.

The diver- gence may be attributed to that they didn't use a kind of probiotics to treat allergic mice.In conclusion this is the first study to explore microbial population changes in food allergic animal model in case of probiotics administra- tion.

The results implied that BB supplementa- tion significantly modified metabolic pathways of gut microbiota.DiscussionGut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of food allergy.

Of note intestinal microflora has been demon- strated to play an important role in maintaining the Th1Th2 balance 9 which is the key mechanism involved in allergic diseases.The role of probiotics in allergic disease has been highlighted recently.

However whether probiotics treatment elicited changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota there- by regulating allergic disease remains poorly understood.The current study investigated the beneficialeffect of Bifidobacterium Infantis BB in aFigure 1.
