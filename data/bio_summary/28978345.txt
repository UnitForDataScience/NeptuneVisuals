However no significant difference was found in air communities be- tween households with different ventilation systems naturalmechanical regardless of metrics used suggest- ing that ventilation strategy played a lesser role in shap- ing the air mycobiome in the residences sampled.Cross-domain comparison of bacterial and fungal communitiesTo explore the correlation between bacterial and fungal communities within each sample type we combined the current fungal data with our previous work that analyzed indoor bacterial communities  of the same households and occupants.

These observations raise three questions 1 What is driving the distance-decay pattern of the airborne bacterial and fungal communities2 Why do fungi and bacteria present different dispersal limitations 3 If there is a correlation between fungal community and geographic distance in the North-South transect why this pattern is not being observed in the East-West transect or even on a larger city-wide scaleFungi can disperse through sporulation and a large number of propagules increase the chance for long-distance passive dispersal In addition fungal spores are usually aerosolized as dry spores while bac- teria are generally trapped in liquid droplets before re- leasing into the air .

However regardless of the metric used the effect size remained low for air and surface samples where the bacterial and fungal communities were mod- erately correlated.Distance-decay patternOur previous bacterial study  and current fungal work jointly revealed that household was the strongest factor that significantly shaped the composition and structure of the indoor airborne communities.

This study provides important in- sights into the indoor transmission route of potential fungal allergens and pathogens and the foundation to further study the complex relationships between indoor fungal exposure occupant health and the influence of outdoor environment.Additional filesFundingThis research was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong through project 11276116.

LeeBackgroundIndividuals in urban societies spend most of their time indoors The indoor environment also referred to as the built environment BE is also the habitat for micro- organisms and represents a major interface of contact between humans and microbes  In recent years in- door microbiome has received much research interest as organisms detected within BEs can be detrimental to human health - Therefore understanding factors that shape the indoor microbiome and its dispersal has great importance for occupants' health and well-being.Human skin itself is home to a diverse community of commensal microbiota consisting of bacteria fungi archaea and viruses - Since the advent of high- throughput sequencing bacteria as the predominantskin colonizers have thus far garnered tremendous at- tention in microbiome work - The diversity and composition of skin bacterial community are highly personalized and site-specific Direct contact between human skin and indoor surfaces is a major route for microbial dispersal and residential surfaces harbor unique skin bacterial signatures In addition occupants release particles into the surround- ing environment and leave the indoor air with distinctive human-associated microbial fingerprints While bacterial communities on skin are better under- stood cutaneous microbial assemblages are not limited to bacteria with fungi also occupying a wide range of skin niches Within fungal communities mycobiome Malassezia Rhodotorula Debaromyces Cryptococcus and Candida are among the most prevalent cutaneous taxa Correspondence School of Energy and Environment City University of Hong Kong Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kongacross different individuals and population groups  .

The mechanisms by which fungi disperse within BEs and whether endemic fungal taxa exist in Asian households are also unknown.

In this study the air skin and surface mycobiomes of 19 households dis- tributed throughout Hong Kong HK were analyzed and compared with our previous bacterial work in the same households The objective is to determine whether like bacteria fungi can be transferred between surface and skin and therefore whether household surfaces harbor the human skin fungal fingerprint.
