however no significant difference was found in air communities be- tween households with different ventilation systems naturalmechanical regardless of metrics used suggest- ing that ventilation strategy played a lesser role in shap- ing the air mycobiome in the residences sampled.cross-domain comparison of bacterial and fungal communitiesto explore the correlation between bacterial and fungal communities within each sample type we combined the current fungal data with our previous work that analyzed indoor bacterial communities  of the same households and occupants.

these observations raise three questions 1 what is driving the distance-decay pattern of the airborne bacterial and fungal communities2 why do fungi and bacteria present different dispersal limitations 3 if there is a correlation between fungal community and geographic distance in the north-south transect why this pattern is not being observed in the east-west transect or even on a larger city-wide scalefungi can disperse through sporulation and a large number of propagules increase the chance for long-distance passive dispersal in addition fungal spores are usually aerosolized as dry spores while bac- teria are generally trapped in liquid droplets before re- leasing into the air .

however regardless of the metric used the effect size remained low for air and surface samples where the bacterial and fungal communities were mod- erately correlated.distance-decay patternour previous bacterial study  and current fungal work jointly revealed that household was the strongest factor that significantly shaped the composition and structure of the indoor airborne communities.

this study provides important in- sights into the indoor transmission route of potential fungal allergens and pathogens and the foundation to further study the complex relationships between indoor fungal exposure occupant health and the influence of outdoor environment.additional filesfundingthis research was supported by the research grants council of hong kong through project 11276116. the funder had no role in the design data collection interpretation and submission of the work presented here.availability of data and materialssequencing reads generated for this study have been deposited at the ncbi sequence read archive sra under the accession numbers srp059432for skin samples and srp099248 for residential air and surface samples.

the mechanisms by which fungi disperse within bes and whether endemic fungal taxa exist in asian households are also unknown.

in this study the air skin and surface mycobiomes of 19 households dis- tributed throughout hong kong hk were analyzed and compared with our previous bacterial work in the same households the objective is to determine whether like bacteria fungi can be transferred between surface and skin and therefore whether household surfaces harbor the human skin fungal fingerprint.

genomic dna was extracted and fungal its1 region was amplified with the 18sfw 5.8srv primer pair libraries were prepared using the illumina miseq reagent kit v2 and sequenced on a miseq platform to generate 250 bp paired-end reads.bioinformaticsforward and reverse reads were merged trimmed and filtered to a uniform length of 300 bp with an error rate of less than 0.5 error per read in usearch version 9.0.2132 dereplicated reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity fol- lowing the uparse pipeline all sequences were first assigned taxonomy with the unite database  using the uclust algorithm in qiime version 1.9.1 and a curated dataset was then adopted to provide taxonomic information for reads that were unclassified at the genus rank with unite.

spearman test was used to investigate the cross-domain bacterial and fungal alpha- and beta-diversity correla- tions.

mantel test in the r package ade4 was applied to calculate the correlation between the geo- graphic distance and the indoor bacterial or fungal com- munity dissimilarity at three spatial scales with binary jaccard as the community distance metric.

the sampling and sequencing information of the three studies used in source tracking are summarized in additional file table s2.resultsotus distributiona total of 1501 fungal otus were retained after quality control of the sequencing data.

a small number of otus deriving from the common skin fungal members of malassezia penicillium and pichia as well as an envir- onmental species aspergillus niger were the indicator taxa for skin samples.
