the average confidence of the maldi- tof method was 82.5 as 47 out of 57 strains were identified in accordance to the definitive identification.a wide variety of staphylococcus species n  13 was found in our samples particularly s. lentus 28.0 2175 and s. nepalensis 20.0 1575 followed by s. cohnii 8.0 675 s.sciuri 8.0 675 s. xylosus 5.3 475 s. equorum 5.3 475 s. epidermidis 4.0 375 s. aureus 2.7 275 s. saprophyticus 1.3 175 s. felis 1.3 175 s. pettenkoferi 1.3 175 s. haemolyticus 1.3 175 and s. fleurettii 1.3 175. in addi- tion nine 12 atypical strains could not be identified to the species level despite being identified as belonging to the genus staphylococcus.antimicrobial susceptibility and plasmidsthe susceptibility of the 75 strains against eight antimicrobials is presented in .

these sequences were deposited in genbank under the access numbers ku883215-ku883217.discussionin this study staphylococci strains isolated from the orophar- ynx of healthy domestic cats living in different residences located in rio de janeiro brazil were characterized to the species level and phenotypic and genetic aspects of antimicrobial resistance.since biochemical tests for the identification of species from the staphylococcus genus can yield inconsistent results inferior to those observed with molecular biology procedures   the 75 strains used in this study were initially identified by maldi-tof.

most strains were resistant to oxacillin 95 - 7175 and tetracycline 76 - 5775 followed by erythromycin 33.3 - 2575 ampicillin 28 - 2175 chloram- phenicol 24 - 1875 mupirocin 12 - 975 gentamicin 4 - 375 and cefoxitin 2.7 - 275. among the strains 45fig.

from the genes for aminoglycoside resistance expected to be present in the gentamicin-resistant strains 432 1321 and 114  only the aadd gene was found in one s. cohnii strain 1321. the meca gene was widespread being found in 63 4775 of the strains .

in relation to the mupa gene it was found in only one out of three of the mupirocin- resistant strains s. sciuri 199.investigation of crisprthe crispr molecular marker cas1 gene was investigated by pcr in all 75 strains studied in this work.

genomic dna was isolated with the wizardtm genomic dna purification kit promega usa following the manufacturer's instructions.bacterial species identificationthe identification of the bacterial strains was performed by combining different molecular approaches.

a cas1f 50-agaagcacaggctgcaagaa- 30 and cas1r 50-tcacactatcaagtaacctcacca-30 primer pair was designed based on a conserved region of the gene obtained from the alignment made with the sequences of the followingtable 1species identification of staphylococcus strains used in this work by maldi-tof complemented with sequencing of the tuf and rpob genes.a species were defined when at least two of the three identification techniques were concordant.

strains with inconclusive results to the species level were designated as s. spp.b results yielded from maldi-tof were unreliable scores  jwae 1.699.138c.c.

with this method 57 76 strains were identified with scores 2.000 indicating according to the flexcontrol software 3.3 manufacturer a secure genus identification and probable species identification.

the results we obtained by maldi-tof are consistent with this statement since a significant portion of the isolated strains showed atypical peptide profiles hampering their identification.some staphylococcus species isolated in the last two decades are still poorly studied such as s. nepalensis first identified in 2003 in the respiratory tract of goats in the himalayan region   and s. pettenkoferi isolated in 2002 from human clinical specimens in germany .

as expected the sequence of both rpob and tuf genes enabled us to identify the species of most strains previously not determined by maldi-tof.

in addition some atypical strains yielded different results for the three methods employed not being identified to the species level.

although the cefoxitin disk is generally preferable to be used in search of strains containing the meca gene as recommended by the  for some species like s. pseudintermedius the oxacillin disk is recommended.

because we worked with many understudied staphylococcus species using both cefoxitin and oxacillin to search for meca-positive strains enable us to retrieve richer information from our sample.
