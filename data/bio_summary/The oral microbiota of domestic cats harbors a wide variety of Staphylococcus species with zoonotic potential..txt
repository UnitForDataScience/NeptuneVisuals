These sequences were deposited in Genbank under the access numbers KU883215-KU883217.DiscussionIn this study staphylococci strains isolated from the orophar- ynx of healthy domestic cats living in different residences located in Rio de Janeiro Brazil were characterized to the species level and phenotypic and genetic aspects of antimicrobial resistance.Since biochemical tests for the identification of species from the Staphylococcus genus can yield inconsistent results inferior to those observed with molecular biology procedures   the 75 strains used in this study were initially identified by MALDI-TOF.

In addi- tion nine 12 atypical strains could not be identified to the species level despite being identified as belonging to the genus Staphylococcus.Antimicrobial susceptibility and plasmidsThe susceptibility of the 75 strains against eight antimicrobials is presented in .

In relation to the mupA gene it was found in only one out of three of the mupirocin- resistant strains S. sciuri 199.Investigation of CRISPRThe CRISPR molecular marker cas1 gene was investigated by PCR in all 75 strains studied in this work.

Genomic DNA was isolated with the WizardTM Genomic DNA Purification Kit Promega USA following the manufacturer's instructions.Bacterial species identificationThe identification of the bacterial strains was performed by combining different molecular approaches.

With this method 57 76 strains were identified with scores 2.000 indicating according to the FlexControl software 3.3 manufacturer a secure genus identification and probable species identification.

The average confidence of the MALDI- TOF method was 82.5 as 47 out of 57 strains were identified in accordance to the definitive identification.A wide variety of Staphylococcus species n  13 was found in our samples particularly S. lentus 28.0 2175 and S. nepalensis 20.0 1575 followed by S. cohnii 8.0 675 S.sciuri 8.0 675 S. xylosus 5.3 475 S. equorum 5.3 475 S. epidermidis 4.0 375 S. aureus 2.7 275 S. saprophyticus 1.3 175 S. felis 1.3 175 S. pettenkoferi 1.3 175 S. haemolyticus 1.3 175 and S. fleurettii 1.3 175.

The results we obtained by MALDI-TOF are consistent with this statement since a significant portion of the isolated strains showed atypical peptide profiles hampering their identification.Some Staphylococcus species isolated in the last two decades are still poorly studied such as S. nepalensis first identified in 2003 in the respiratory tract of goats in the Himalayan region   and S. pettenkoferi isolated in 2002 from human clinical specimens in Germany .

As expected the sequence of both rpoB and tuf genes enabled us to identify the species of most strains previously not determined by MALDI-TOF.

In addition some atypical strains yielded different results for the three methods employed not being identified to the species level.

Although the cefoxitin disk is generally preferable to be used in search of strains containing the mecA gene as recommended by the  for some species like S. pseudintermedius the oxacillin disk is recommended.
