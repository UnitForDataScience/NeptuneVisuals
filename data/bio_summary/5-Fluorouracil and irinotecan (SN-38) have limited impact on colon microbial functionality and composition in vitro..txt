However again no effect on SCFA production was observed excluding the fact that the mucuslayer protects the microbiota against the SN-38 .Effect of SN-38 on the gut microbial profileTo investigate the effect of SN-38 on the composition of both luminal and mucosal microbiota DGGE and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were performed for all samples at day 0 and day 6.Clustering analysis of DGGE profiles showed large interindividual variability but no effect of SN-38 treatment was observed.

Considering that on average 1.2 of the dose is excreted as SN-38 in the feces within 24 h   an estimated average colon concentration of 1-2 uM and assuming a homogeneous distribution along the colon a dose of 10 uM SN-38 was used in the luminal part of the M-SHIME.Neither 5-FU nor SN-38 had a significant impact on the functionality or the composition of the M-SHIME community.

There were no clear shifts in the microbial profile of all five donors and only minor differences between control and SN-38 treated samples could be observed .16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.

The relative concentration of each SCFA was expressed as mol being the ratio of its concentration mM and the total SCFA concentration mM multiplied by 100.DNA extractionLuminal samples 1 mL for total DNA extraction were centrifuged for 10 min at 18000 rcf supernatant was removed and the pellet was stored immediately at -20 C until further analysis.Total DNA was extracted from the pellet of 1 mL liquid samples or 0.25 g mucin-agar according to a protocol adapted from .

Only for donor 2 a changed mucus bacterial profile was observed with increases in Anaeroglobus Roseburia and Parabacteroides and .Effect of SN-38 on the metabolic activity in the gutThe effect of SN-38 the active metabolite of irinotecan at 10 uM in the luminal environment on the gut microbiome of five healthy donors was investigated using a M-SHIME with proximal colon vessels .

As we wanted to investigate a long term dosing we chose to dose at 10 uM 5-FU in the mucus layer which is in close contact with the blood circulation.The active metabolite of irinotecan SN-38 was added to the luminal part of an M-SHIMEQRas it reaches the colon via the small intestine and through microbial synthesishydrolyzing biliary secreted non-toxic SN-38G to the active compound SN-38 by b- glucuronidase activity .

For all samples donor individuals and sampling timepoint explained most of the variation respectively 17.7 and 30.3 p  0.0097 and p  0.0001 and .No effect of SN-38 on specific genera or diversity indices were noticed for all donors but some donor-specific changes of relative abundances of some genera could be observed.

For both 5-FU and SN-38 however we could not evaluate what the effect of chemotherapeutics would be on an unbalanced ecosystem as in our study stool samples from healthy donors non-antibiotic exposed were used as inoculum.

The stock solution was further diluted 11000 in the mucin agar see M-SHIME Experimental set-up to a final concentration of 10 uM.A filter-sterilized stock solution of 10 mM SN-38 Sigma Aldrich Diegem Belgium was prepared in DMSO.

The distal colon vessels 800 ml were connected to the respective proximal colon vessel treated similarly with 5-FU or DMSO as a control via the mucin beads and pH-controlled at pH 6.6-6.9.Experimental design M-SHIME with SN-38In this set-up we compared a challenge of the in vitro cultured human microbiota with SN-38 to a control situation .
