A subset of Treg cells express Helios a transcription factor with a poorly under- stood function in Treg cells but might represent an additional way to differentiate subsets of Treg cells.INVARIANT NATURAL KILLER T CELLS A subset of lymphocytes that express surface molecules characteristic of both natural killer NK cells CD16 and T cells CD3.

Postnatally maternal breast milk contains anti-commensal anti- bodies that help dampen T-cell responses toward the microbiota in suckling pups.Adult GF mice are known to present smaller lymphoid structures including Peyer patches mesenteric lymph nodes and isolated lymphoid follicles.These major structural de- fects are associated with a decrease in the activation frequency or both of lymphoid cells in the intestines and other organs including ab T cells B cells and innate lymphoid cells that can be rescued by conventionalization with SPF microbiota at any age.

In another study Treg cells have the capacity to accumulate in mouse skin in response to colonization with a skin commensal bacterial strain specifically during a window of time that consists of 2 weeks after birth.In this study accumulation of Treg cells in the skin during neonatal life is required to establish tolerance to commensal- derived antigens in the adult.Antibiotic use in neonatal mice drives changes in the microbiota that are associated with an alteration incolon-associated Treg cells and an increased susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness.Consistent with this prenatal and postnatal exposure to antibiotics in human subjects is associated with an increased risk for asthma.

EoE artificially induced by peanut allergen exposure in mice is dependent on iNKT cells because CD1d-deficient mice that lack iNKT cells are protected from disease induction.In parallel a clinical study of children with EoE showed that transcripts for the che- mokine CXCL16 the iNKT T-cell receptor marker Va24 and Cd1d are upregulated in esophageal biopsy specimens of chil- dren with EoE especially during early life.

In adult GF mice for example iNKT cells accumulate in the colon and lung leading to increased susceptibility to an experimental model of colitis and airway hyperresponsivness that is associ- ated with an increased expression of CXCL16.The increased quantity of iNKT cells in these tissues and susceptibility to the associated diseases can be normalized by colonization with standard microbiota or treatment with a CXCL16-neutralizing antibody during neonatal but not adult postweaned life.

Treg cells have the capacity to accumulate in the skin of mice in response to colonization with a skin commensal bacterial strain specifically during early life and are required to establish tolerance to commensal-derived antigens in the adult.to be highly susceptible to later-life environmental triggers of experimental colitis by using oxazoloneor asthma by using ovalbumin sensitization both of which are known to be CD1d-dependent responses.Together these studies show that microbiota can regulate iNKT cells during an early life- restricted window of time and influence later-life susceptibility to inflammatory diseases such as allergy in mice.

Furthermore such early-life regulation of Treg cells can have effects that persist into adult life and affect the predis- position to allergy.IgE and anaphylactic reactionsB cells are the source of different classes of immunoglobulins with different functions.

An absence of microbiota in GF mice during early life leads to an accumulation of lung iNKT cells increased CXCL16 expression and increased susceptibility to asthma in later life.

Moreover this study showed that EoE and the afore- mentioned increase in CD1d-restricted iNKT cell responses is potentially associated with use of antibiotics during the first year of life based on retrospective surveys implicating a role for the microbiota during early life in regulation of iNKT cell responses to EoE-associated allergens in later life.

Convention- alization with microbiota during a specific early-life timeframe but not thereafter can normalize the number of iNKT cells in the lung and susceptibility to colitis and asthma.early-life dysregulation of the immune system by microbiota and development of allergic diseases.Invariant natural killer T cells and eosinophilic esophagitisEosinophilic esophagitis EoE is a chronic allergen- mediated esophageal disease induced by TH2 cytokines that is characterized by esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic inflammation.
