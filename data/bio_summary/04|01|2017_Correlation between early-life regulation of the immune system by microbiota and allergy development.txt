a subset of treg cells express helios a transcription factor with a poorly under- stood function in treg cells but might represent an additional way to differentiate subsets of treg cells.invariant natural killer t cells a subset of lymphocytes that express surface molecules characteristic of both natural killer nk cells cd16 and t cells cd3.

postnatally maternal breast milk contains anti-commensal anti- bodies that help dampen t-cell responses toward the microbiota in suckling pups.adult gf mice are known to present smaller lymphoid structures including peyer patches mesenteric lymph nodes and isolated lymphoid follicles.these major structural de- fects are associated with a decrease in the activation frequency or both of lymphoid cells in the intestines and other organs including ab t cells b cells and innate lymphoid cells that can be rescued by conventionalization with spf microbiota at any age.

in another study treg cells have the capacity to accumulate in mouse skin in response to colonization with a skin commensal bacterial strain specifically during a window of time that consists of 2 weeks after birth.in this study accumulation of treg cells in the skin during neonatal life is required to establish tolerance to commensal- derived antigens in the adult.antibiotic use in neonatal mice drives changes in the microbiota that are associated with an alteration incolon-associated treg cells and an increased susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness.consistent with this prenatal and postnatal exposure to antibiotics in human subjects is associated with an increased risk for asthma.

treg cells have the capacity to accumulate in the skin of mice in response to colonization with a skin commensal bacterial strain specifically during early life and are required to establish tolerance to commensal-derived antigens in the adult.to be highly susceptible to later-life environmental triggers of experimental colitis by using oxazoloneor asthma by using ovalbumin sensitization both of which are known to be cd1d-dependent responses.together these studies show that microbiota can regulate inkt cells during an early life- restricted window of time and influence later-life susceptibility to inflammatory diseases such as allergy in mice.

furthermore such early-life regulation of treg cells can have effects that persist into adult life and affect the predis- position to allergy.ige and anaphylactic reactionsb cells are the source of different classes of immunoglobulins with different functions.

eoe artificially induced by peanut allergen exposure in mice is dependent on inkt cells because cd1d-deficient mice that lack inkt cells are protected from disease induction.in parallel a clinical study of children with eoe showed that transcripts for the che- mokine cxcl16 the inkt t-cell receptor marker va24 and cd1d are upregulated in esophageal biopsy specimens of chil- dren with eoe especially during early life.

in adult gf mice for example inkt cells accumulate in the colon and lung leading to increased susceptibility to an experimental model of colitis and airway hyperresponsivness that is associ- ated with an increased expression of cxcl16.the increased quantity of inkt cells in these tissues and susceptibility to the associated diseases can be normalized by colonization with standard microbiota or treatment with a cxcl16-neutralizing antibody during neonatal but not adult postweaned life.

further- more it is now recognized that when this early-life window of opportunity is not properly exposed to microbiota in mouse models the effects of this inadequate exposure to the early- life immune system can persist into adult life and thus cause permanent consequences for the health of the host.several lines of evidence reveal an association between specificfig 2. role of early-life microbiota in the regulation of inkt cells and development of allergic disease in human subjects and mice.

an absence of microbiota in gf mice during early life leads to an accumulation of lung inkt cells increased cxcl16 expression and increased susceptibility to asthma in later life.

moreover this study showed that eoe and the afore- mentioned increase in cd1d-restricted inkt cell responses is potentially associated with use of antibiotics during the first year of life based on retrospective surveys implicating a role for the microbiota during early life in regulation of inkt cell responses to eoe-associated allergens in later life.

genome-wide association studies have identified a20 as a susceptibility gene in patients with inflammatory disease.group 3 innate lymphoid cells ilc3s innate immune cells with lymphoid features that do not have antigen receptors.

convention- alization with microbiota during a specific early-life timeframe but not thereafter can normalize the number of inkt cells in the lung and susceptibility to colitis and asthma.early-life dysregulation of the immune system by microbiota and development of allergic diseases.invariant natural killer t cells and eosinophilic esophagitiseosinophilic esophagitis eoe is a chronic allergen- mediated esophageal disease induced by th2 cytokines that is characterized by esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic inflammation.

the mouse and human studies described above suggest a prominent role of early-life microbiota in the regulation of inkt cells and devel- opment of later-life susceptibility to allergic diseases .regulatory t cells and asthmathe type of environment to which a subject is exposed determines the range of antigens that are encountered by the immune system.

as an example exposure to farms during early childhood provides a protective effect against allergy development including diseases like asthma.microbial product exposure during childhood as measured based on endotoxin levels in mattress dust is associated with protection against hay fever atopic asthma and atopic sensitization.interestingly this protective effect has been observed in farming and nonfarm- ing households in a rural environment.farm dust and endotoxin protect against allergy at least in part through a mechanism involving a modification of communication between epithelial cells and dendritic cells in a pathway that is dependent on the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme a20 which normally negatively regulates these responses.in parallel maternal farm exposure is associated with increased regulatory t treg cell function in cord blood of pregnant mothers and protection from asthma intheir offspring.furthermore the environment is known to influ- ence the composition of the microbiota.

an increased risk of allergic sensitization and allergic rhinitis but not asthma in the first 6 years of life is correlated with reduced bacterial diversity of the infant's intestinal flora.infants with atopic eczema exhibit a lower diversity of the gut micro- biota.moreover differences in the neonatal gut microflora might precede the development of atopy.together these studies suggest that how the host is colonized by microbes during earlylife in different mucosal tissues can influence the later develop- ment of allergy.early-life regulation of the immune system by microbiota and susceptibility to allergyexperimental studies of germ-free gf compared with specific pathogen-free spf mice demonstrate that the micro- biota is deeply implicated in maturation of the immune system.regulation of the immune system by microbiota can be initiated prenatally through transplacental transfer of molecular signatures from the microbiota to the developing fetus which in the case examined is associated with early postnatal development of group 3 innate lymphoid cells.it is interesting that this period coincides with the transplacental movement of igg and that these observed effects were extinguished in jh22 mice which lack b cells suggesting they might be causally linked.
