While our results were mixed and therefore not necessarily inconsistent with the earlier studies one likely explanation for the lack of any statistically significant overall difference in those studies despite OTU-level differences is the much smaller sample sizes--three samples per age group in the 2012 study and eight to 10 samples per age group in the 2014 study compared to 52 adult samples and 27 chick samples in the present study.Location Effects on AdultsTo assess whether different islands leave distinct signaturesis consistent with previous findings on Codfish Island Waiteon the adult ka-ka-po-fecal microbiota we analyzed a set offive adult ka-ka-po-for which we had samples collected bothwhich are a favored food source for ka-ka-po-when availablepre- and post-translocation to Codfish Island three initially lived on Pearl Island while the other two lived on Maud Island.

However as we lacked sufficient adult samples from Anchor to compare with those of Anchor chicks and Codfish adults it remains unclear whether the fecal microbiota of ka-ka-po- chicks is indeed shaped more strongly by dietary andor other environmental influences or if Anchor Island possesses unique characteristics that similarly affect the adult fecal microbiota.CONCLUSIONOverall our findings suggest that human interventions such as supplementary feeding and relocation to different islands do not significantly influence the overall community structure of the adult ka-ka-po- fecal microbiota.

Fresh fecal samples from chicks were collected during the 2016 breeding season on Codfish Island and Anchor Island 45 45' S 166 31' E. Codfish Island andand freezing for chick samples was unavoidable as chicks could not be left unattended at night.The fecal sample collection in this study was carried out as part of standard management of ka-ka-po- as approved and authorized by NZDOC.

Fresh fecal samples were collected from adult ka-ka-po- on Maud Island 41 1' S 173 53' E Pearl Island 47 11' S 167 42' E and Whenua HouCodfish Island hereafter referred to as Codfish Island 46 47' S 167 38' E in the years 1998-2001 and primarily on Codfish Island in 2014-2016 Figure S1.

However additional functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by these genes would be required to support this proposed explanation for the robustness of the ka-ka-po- fecal microbiota to supplementary feeding.Age EffectsTo determine whether fecal microbiota community structure differs between age groups we analyzed samples collected from ka-ka-po- adults and chicks on Codfish Island during the 2016breeding season.

We therefore also hypothesized that ka-ka-po- adults and chicks living on different islands might exhibit divergent fecal microbiotas in ways that could be relevant to their health.To test these hypotheses we conducted a 16S rRNA gene survey on fecal samples from adult ka-ka-po- on three different diets and three islands as well as fecal samples from chicks on two islands.

2014.Supplementary Feeding EffectsTo evaluate the effects of different diets on the ka-ka-po- fecal microbiota we analyzed samples from adult ka-ka-po- on Codfish Island that had been supplementally fed either HPC pellets n  20 from 9 birds or Pumpkin pellets n  17 from 11 for at least 2 weeks prior to sample collection during the 2016 breeding season.

The two groups visibly differed upon plotting the relative abundances of major taxonomic groups in their fecal microbiotas representatives of the phylum Firmicutes were nearly absent from the Anchor Island samples but accounted for a high proportion of sequences in several Codfish Island samples Figure 6A.

Remarkably neither supplementary feeding nor geographic location were associated with significant differences in the overall fecal microbial community structures of adult ka- ka- po-  suggesting that the ka- ka- po- 's low-diversity fecal microbiota is both inherent to this species and robust to these external influences.Keywords gut microbiota microbial communities microbial ecology symbionts avianINTRODUCTIONThe ka-ka-po- Strigops habroptilus is a critically endangered herbivorous parrot endemic to New Zealand notable for its flightlessness large size 1.3-4 kg and lek mating system Powlesland et al.
