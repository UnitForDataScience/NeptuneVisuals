As the use of microbiome data in forensic research is standardized knowledge of these tools in forensic research is key to significantly advancethefieldand to fullyintegratemicrobiome-deriveddatainto the forensic community.Any introduction of novel techniques in forensic science alsonecessitates changes in the laws and standards governing their collection and use.

Here we summarize information on the current status of microbiome research as applies to the forensic field the mathematical models used to make predictions and the possible legal and practical difficulties that can limit the application of microbiomes in forensic science.c 2017 The Authors.

However the capacity of WGS of microbiomes to aid in forensic investigations by connecting objects and environments to individuals has been poorly investigated  and although suggesting significant potential it is limited as a forensic tool at this time.

The Forensics Microbiome Database FMD created by our group which links publicly available 16S rRNA-derived taxa data with their geographic origins down to the city in order to perform geolocation  is an example of harnessing meta-samples to perform forensic analyses.Forensic microbiome applicationsThe potential forensic utility of microbial DNA has been demonstrated for samples collected from highly diverse locations including the environment e.g.

Thus the forensic literature refers to the potential uses of microbial-derived data  distinctive signa- tures  and forensic indicators .

Since each of these indicators is of interest to forensic scientists we will take a closer look at these three scenarios to explore how microbiome derived data can be employed in forensic studies.IdentityResearches have demonstrated the potential to identify a single individual in large populations based on microbial fingerprints from metagenomic tags even over long periods of time .

Machine learning and classification methods as applied in microbial forensic research may be useful in identifying potential contamination sources and labeling errors in samples of forensic relevance .

Next generation sequencing technologies increased available genetic data that could be used as evidence by orders of magnitude and as such significant additional genetic information is now available for use in forensic science.

However the applications of this new field in forensic sciences raises concerns on current methods used in sample processing including sample collection storage and the statistical power of published studies.
