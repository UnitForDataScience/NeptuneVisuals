26 found in a cohort of 200 children including 50 with ige-mediated wheat allergy 50 celiac disease cd 50 h. pylori infection and 50 healthy ones that serum concentrations of wheat and rice igg and igg4 are elevated in children with cd h. pylori infection and wheat allergy compared to healthy ones.to establish the relationship between h. pylori infection and cd in children the h. pylori prevalence in children with confirmed cd was compared to that in nonceliac children referred for endoscopy.

the overall prevalence of h. pylori was 3.1 14454.10the prevalence of h. pylori assessed by a hpsa among 240 as- ymptomatic children living in a rural setting in sub-saharan africa was 14.2.11 the prevalence of h. pylori assessed by oral swabs using pcr in 162 asymptomatic mexican children was 13.12finally the intrafamilial transmission of h. pylori was explored in iranian children who required an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as in their parents.

in this latter group 7.0 of patients were h. pylori-positive in the up- front h. pylori non ihc special stain the prevalence was 7.8 whereas patients with upfront ihc had a prevalence of 10.2 p .0001. they reported a dramatic improvement in detection of h. pylori infection using upfront ihc.37to determine the association between follicular gastritis and h. py- lori infection in children a cross-sectional study was conducted in 123 children who underwent a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

1e12414.httpsdoi.org10.1111hel.12414c 2017 john wiley  sons ltd  1 of 7transmission of h. pylori infection may have occurred not only during childhood but also during adolescence.2in poland the prevalence of h. pylori and non-h. pylori helicobacter nhph infection was assessed in symptomatic children from 2000 to 2013. this retrospective analysis was based on h. pylori culture in 8661 untreated children undergoing their first upper gastroduode- nal endoscopy because of digestive symptoms suggestive of gastritis.

the overall prevalence of h. pylori infection was 18.6 with a significant increase with age 14.8 20.2 and 25.8 in 3-6 7-11 and 12-17 year age groups respectively and a significant decrease with time from 21.6 in 2007 to 17.2 in 2014.4in latvia the prevalence of h. pylori infection among preschool children aged 1-6 years median 5 years did not significantly decrease during a ten-year period with a prevalence of 15.5 15101 deter- mined by the monoclonal hpsa.5conversely the prevalence of h. pylori infection remains high in newly arrived refugees attending the migrant health service in south australia where 922 adults and children were screened in a cross- sectional study using the monoclonal hpsa.

according to the genotyping results of h. pyloristrains isolated in 30 families 10 33.3 children exhibited h. pylori with related genotypes to their mothers while only two children 6.7 had h. pylori genotypes similar to their fathers.

children with rap had a higher h. pylori infection rate than the control group 58.6 vs 44.8 but there was no signifi- cant difference between the rap symptoms in h. pylori-positive chil- dren vs h. pylori-negative ones.14 a prospective observational study analyzed 240 brazilian children and adolescents mean age 9.8 years range 4-17 with chronic nonulcer dyspepsia who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies.

the sensitivity specificity positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio for the igg antibody cutoff 10 uml were 96.5 93 13.83 0.038 respectively.32in 2011 guidelines from espghan and naspghan for h. pylori infection in children stated that antibody tests for h. pylori in serum urine or saliva are not reliable for use in children for clinical set- tings.29 recently antibody tests for detection of h. pylori-specific igg by elisa in urine have been tested on 806 junior and senior students in japan.

h. pylori infec- tion was detected in 44 of cases and it was significantly associated with follicular gastritis adjusted for the children's age.38to assess the feasibility of using breath ammonia analysis based on off-axis cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy oa-ceas with an external-cavity diode laser ecl for noninvasive diagnosis of h. py- lori infection analyses were performed on 15 healthy volunteers 8 children and 19 adults with h. pylori infection.

the gastric commensal bacteria in children are altered during h. pylori infection in parallel with more tolerogenic gastric mucosa potentially contributing to the reduced gastric disease characteristic of h. pylori- infected children.486  treatment although the treatment of h. pylori infection in children has greatly improved since the discovery of its pathological role in childhood the side effects of antimicrobial combinations and persistence of drug- resistant strains in case of failure or over-use of antimicrobials in the population have resulted in a significant and rising burden of the dis- ease worldwide putting stress on health care resources of countries at all economic levels.

recently aiguilera-correa et al.41 evaluated the performances of the commercially available kit genotyper helicodr hain life science germany to detect h. pylori infection and its clarithromy- cin resistance genotype in biopsies obtained from 136 children 111 were h. pylori-positive 81.6 53 had resistant genotypes 47.7 and 11 exhibited heterogeneous genotype 9.9. the most fre- quent mutation was a2143g 87.5 followed by a2142g 7.5 and double mutant a2142c-a2143g 5. in 11 biopsies wild-type plus a2143g or a2142g were found.41 however the authors did not investigate the possibility of multiple infections that may also explain these findings.in a chilean pediatric population of 118 children a clarithro- mycin resistance rate of 21 was reported using pcr mainly due to a2142g and a2143g mutations.42 furthermore the same authors reported a metronidazole resistance rate as low as 2 based on the detection of the rdxa gene hp0954 deletion de- tected by pcr mutational inactivation.42 conversely in a large german study including 582 of mainly treatment-naive pediatric patients the authors reported an overall resistance to metronida- zole clarithromycin and rifampicin of 28.7 23.2 and 13.3 respectively.

h. pylori-positive and h. pylori-negative subjects did not differ in overnight polysomnography with ph-metry acid gastro- esophageal reflux index nor in age gender nutritional status bmi-z score and hematologic indices in the sdb group.22the association between h. pylori infection and type i diabetes mel- litus t1dm in children is controversial.

when taking into account maternal h. pylori sta- tus only h. pylori-positive children with an h. pylori-negative mother had increased risk of asthma 2.42 1.11-5.27 accounting for 3.4 of the asthma risk.25 in another study czaja-bulsa et al.

helicobacter pylori infection was present in 11.4 of patients with cd vs 50 in those without cd p .001. the authors concluded that cd and gastric h. pylori infection have an inverse relationship which raises the question of whether development of h. pylori infection con- fers protection against cd or not.273  diagnosis in a review of the literature hr yang updated the differences be- tween children and adults in the diagnosis of h. pylori infection.

in iran among 1558 children aged 6-13 years 145 children with rap according to the apley and naish criteria were compared to 145 aged matched healthy children recruited from the same area.
