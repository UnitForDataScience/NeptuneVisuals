26 found in a cohort of 200 children including 50 with IgE-mediated wheat allergy 50 celiac disease CD 50 H. pylori infection and 50 healthy ones that serum concentrations of wheat and rice IgG and IgG4 are elevated in children with CD H. pylori infection and wheat allergy compared to healthy ones.To establish the relationship between H. pylori infection and CD in children the H. pylori prevalence in children with confirmed CD was compared to that in nonceliac children referred for endoscopy.

The overall prevalence of H. pylori was 3.1 14454.10The prevalence of H. pylori assessed by a HpSA among 240 as- ymptomatic children living in a rural setting in sub-Saharan Africa was 14.2.11 The prevalence of H. pylori assessed by oral swabs using PCR in 162 asymptomatic Mexican children was 13.12Finally the intrafamilial transmission of H. pylori was explored in Iranian children who required an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as in their parents.

The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 18.6 with a significant increase with age 14.8 20.2 and 25.8 in 3-6 7-11 and 12-17 year age groups respectively and a significant decrease with time from 21.6 in 2007 to 17.2 in 2014.4In Latvia the prevalence of H. pylori infection among preschool children aged 1-6 years median 5 years did not significantly decrease during a ten-year period with a prevalence of 15.5 15101 deter- mined by the monoclonal HpSA.5Conversely the prevalence of H. pylori infection remains high in newly arrived refugees attending the migrant health service in South Australia where 922 adults and children were screened in a cross- sectional study using the monoclonal HpSA.

According to the genotyping results of H. pyloristrains isolated in 30 families 10 33.3 children exhibited H. pylori with related genotypes to their mothers while only two children 6.7 had H. pylori genotypes similar to their fathers.

The sensitivity specificity positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio for the IgG antibody cutoff 10 UmL were 96.5 93 13.83 0.038 respectively.32In 2011 guidelines from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN for H. pylori infection in children stated that antibody tests for H. pylori in serum urine or saliva are not reliable for use in children for clinical set- tings.29 Recently antibody tests for detection of H. pylori-specific IgG by ELISA in urine have been tested on 806 junior and senior students in Japan.

H. pylori infec- tion was detected in 44 of cases and it was significantly associated with follicular gastritis adjusted for the children's age.38To assess the feasibility of using breath ammonia analysis based on off-axis cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy OA-CEAS with an external-cavity diode laser ECL for noninvasive diagnosis of H. py- lori infection analyses were performed on 15 healthy volunteers 8 children and 19 adults with H. pylori infection.

The gastric commensal bacteria in children are altered during H. pylori infection in parallel with more tolerogenic gastric mucosa potentially contributing to the reduced gastric disease characteristic of H. pylori- infected children.486  TREATMENT Although the treatment of H. pylori infection in children has greatly improved since the discovery of its pathological role in childhood the side effects of antimicrobial combinations and persistence of drug- resistant strains in case of failure or over-use of antimicrobials in the population have resulted in a significant and rising burden of the dis- ease worldwide putting stress on health care resources of countries at all economic levels.

They reported a dramatic improvement in detection of H. pylori infection using upfront IHC.37To determine the association between follicular gastritis and H. py- lori infection in children a cross-sectional study was conducted in 123 children who underwent a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Children with RAP had a higher H. pylori infection rate than the control group 58.6 vs 44.8 but there was no signifi- cant difference between the RAP symptoms in H. pylori-positive chil- dren vs H. pylori-negative ones.14 A prospective observational study analyzed 240 Brazilian children and adolescents mean age 9.8 years range 4-17 with chronic nonulcer dyspepsia who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies.

H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative subjects did not differ in overnight polysomnography with pH-metry acid gastro- esophageal reflux index nor in age gender nutritional status BMI-z score and hematologic indices in the SDB group.22The association between H. pylori infection and type I diabetes mel- litus T1DM in children is controversial.
