thus the insights obtained from the current analysis suggest possible role of two of the putrefaction pathways namely histidine degradation and spermidinespermine production occurring in 50 and 60 respectively in the analyzed pathogenic strainsin the pathogenicity of gut bacteria.enrichment of putrefaction pathways associated with release of harmful compounds in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer patientsgiven the putrefying capabilities of gut associated pathogenic organisms as discussed in section gut bacteria and putrefaction pathways associated with release of harmful compoundsand the potential role of some of the putrefaction products in disease etiology of crc a comparative analysis was performed on publicly available gut microbiome data of crc patients and corresponding healthy controls.

the gut strains affiliated as pathogens and commensals were then mapped to the catalog of putrefactors identified in the current study and the respective distributions of putrefaction pathways were obtained.3 comparison of putrefaction pathways associated with release of harmful compounds in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer and healthy individualsin order to compare the putrefaction capabilities of the microbes residing in the gut of crc patients with that of healthy individuals the gut microbiome data 16s rrna sequences provided in five published studies on crc was analyzed           .

the insights obtained from the present study indicate utilization of possible microbiome-based therapies to minimize the adverse effects of gut microbiome in enteric diseases.keywords protein fermentation genome mining bacterial pathogenicity gut microbiome colorectal cancerintroductionputrefaction inside human gastrointestinal tract gut pertains to decomposition or fermentation of undigested proteins by the resident microbiota  .

this suggests the possible role of bacterial putrefaction in the gut where availability of undigested proteins can trigger activation of certain putrefaction pathways in the above mentioned bacterial groups.gut bacteria and putrefaction pathways associated with release of harmful compoundsgiven the observed association of the selected bacterial putrefaction pathways and gut environment further analysis was performed on the bacterial genera previously known to be associated with gut .

82166. doi fermentation of undigested proteins in human gastrointestinal tract gut by the resident microbiota a process called bacterial putrefaction can sometimes disrupt the gut homeostasis.

the excess products of this process have also been reported to be mostly detrimental to gut health unlike those of carbohydrate fermentation which help maintaining gut homeostasis  .

given the clinical importance of putrefaction products ananalysis of putrefaction pathways utilized by various gut bacteria is likely to be helpful for obtaining insights into possible strategies used by the bacterial groups for exerting harmful effects on gut.the deleterious effects of putrefaction in gut have been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer crc     .

thus understanding the role of putrefaction capabilities of microbiome in the gut of crc patients is likely to shed light on the deleterious effects of putrefaction products on gut health.in the present study a comprehensive analysis of bacterial genomes was performed to predict their capabilities of utilizing selected putrefaction pathways that are known to be associated with harmful metabolites.

further the insights obtained from genome mining have been utilized to understand the role of these pathways harbored by the gut microbiome in crc patients.materials and methodsselection of putrefaction pathwaysthe primary focus of the current study pertains to bacterial putrefaction pathways which lead to production of compounds that have been reported to be detrimental to gut.

'identification of putrefaction pathways associated with release of harmful compounds in gut pathogens and commensalsin order to investigate the association between bacterial pathogenicity and putrefaction capability comprehensive list of known gut commensals and pathogens was collated from 'integrated microbial genomes and microbiome' imgm   and literature supplementary table s3.

in addition since some of the strains of the above mentioned genera have been reported to exert pathogenicity in gut further analysis of putrefaction pathways in pathogenic and commensal bacteria were carried out.the analysis of pathogenic and commensal gut bacteria revealed that all the 21 strains affiliated as pathogens contain one or more putrefaction pathways .

overall the observation of relatively higher percentage of histidine degradation and putrescine production pathways in carcinoma cohort combined with the results of the analysis on gut pathogens as discussed in the previous section indicate possible role of these pathways in disease pathogenesis of crc.hypoxic tumor microenvironment and putrefying bacteriathe results of the microbiome analysis indicated a relative enrichment of putrefying bacteria in gut microbiome of crc cohort at later stage of the disease as compared to that in the early adenoma stage .

the results of our analyses suggest a relatively higherputrefaction abilities of the phyla that are commonly found in the gut such as firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria proteobacteria and fusobacteria indicating significance of bacterial putrefaction in gut environment.

however elevated levels of the putrefaction products have been implicated in disruption of gut homeostasis and also in colorectal tumor progression especially in individuals with compromised immune system and prior exposure to gut infectiondiseases    .

interestingly unlike commensal gut bacteria fusobacterium has been shown to utilize an ammonia releasing pathway for production of butyrate which plays multiple beneficial roles in gut  .
