Salar de Llamara Laguna Jachucoposa Laguna Tebenquiche and Salar de Ascotan  Surpris- ingly investigations regarding the halophilic microbial diversity of Salar de Uyuni have not been published yet to the best of our knowl- edge.

Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia harbors a system of ephemeral acidic hypersaline lakes that are fed by saline groundwater of up to 28 salinity and extreme pH 2.4 to moder- ate pH 4-6 acidity The acidic brine is inhabited by a diverse microbial community including haloar- chaea Hydrochemically brines of Salar de Uyuni have been investigated in detail but stud- ies on extremely halophilic microorganisms are missing yet  During several sampling cam- paigns moderately acidic brines of pH values between 4.62 and5.84 were found in a section of the southeastern shore of Salar de Uyuni In the current study we present the composition of microbial communities dwelling in near neutral and slightly acidic lithium-rich hypersaline brines at four sampling location across the salar.Material and methodsSite descriptionSalar de Uyuni is located in the Southwest of Bolivia confined by the Cordilleras Real and Occidental As part of the central Altiplano it covers an area of 10582 km2 at an altitude of 3653 m within the department Potosi.

Location of the Salar de Uyuni Bolivia within the South American Altiplano A. Overview of the salar highlighting the brine pools selected for sampling B.amount of estimated 5.4 million tons the Salar de Uyuni is ranked one of the lithium-richest deposits in the world Extremely halophilic microorganisms occur in brine solutions of at least 10 wv salt up to saturation  Likewise they can inhabit fluid inclusions of pri- mary or secondary halite crystals and survive or even thrive for millions of years as salt-entrapped cell entities  The halobacteria's confusion to biology Larsen's famous lecture on the life of halophiles at the borderland of physio- logical possibilities is continuously repeated for good reasons Although some bacterial genera as e.g.

It has been modified to the new pair Pro341FPro805R to reach higher coverage also for archaeal rRNA gene sequences Future NGS based community analyses of habitats from Salar de Uyuni are planned to be performed with this modified primer pair.The 16S rRNA-based metagenomic analysis of the brine pool samples from Salar de Uyuni revealed a clear predominance of the class Halobacteria.

The species richness of the archaeal commu- nity within the less saline neighbouring Salar de Huasco amounts to SACE  44  Thus it is far lower than the observed species in the samples of Salar de Uyuni.

UV irradiance has been measured in various salares of the Andean highland The UV index within the Salar de Uyuni seems to reach almost the same extreme values as determined for the High-altitude Andean lake HAAL ecosystem One of the mechanisms for UV resistance in halophilic isolates from HAAL habitats is based on DNA-damage photo-repair by photolyases and could play a similar role at theOjos del Salar location In contrast to the research on UV irradiance of the HAAL ecosys- tem the influence of high lithium concentrations on a possible resistance development in halophiles has not been systematically investigated yet.

The identification of the family Archaeoglobaceae as adventitious part of the microbial community within the brine pools of Ojos del Salar presents a further indication for the exis- tence of a thermal spring in the Eastern region of the salt flat since Archaeoglobaceae are commonly affiliated with high-temperature hydrothermal systems 16S metagenomicsThe metagenomic approach provides a tool for both general studies of microbial diversity and for the investigation of novel microorganisms their genomes and their adaptation mechanisms in unexplored or extreme and inhospitable habitats  In this study it has been shown that the four investigated brine pool communities of Salar de Uyuni consist solely of archaeal taxa.

Even if the limited taxonomic resolution of the V3-V4 region for halobacteria is considered it seems likely to discover new hitherto undescribed genera of the family halobacteriaceae in this particular habitat of Salar de Uyuni in future.c 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
