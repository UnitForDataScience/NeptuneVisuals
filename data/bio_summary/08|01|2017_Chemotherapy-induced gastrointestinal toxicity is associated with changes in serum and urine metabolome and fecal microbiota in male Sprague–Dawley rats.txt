The serum levels of another ketone body acetoacetate did not differ between the groups suggesting that ketogen- esis was not overly active in the treatment groups despite their increased levels of certain serum fatty acid moie- ties.

Our secondary aim was to examine how these changes relate to the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with chemo- therapy and to identify possible biomarkers for CIGT.Overall our results show that the chemotherapy-associ- ated phenotype is associated with increased relative abun- dance of bacteria known to produce lipopolysaccharideLPS increased levels of serum fatty acids and NCH33 moieties and decreased levels of Krebs cycle metabo- lites and free amino acids.

At the end of the experiment irinotecan had induced a significant decrease in microbial diversity compared to the other groups c. The administered chemotherapeutics caused significant changes in thecomposition of fecal microbiota d. Irinotecan treatment increased the relative abundances of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria as well as decreased the relative abundances of Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes and Synergistetes.

VIP scores revealed the individual metabolites that were the most relevant for discrimination VIP score  1 between the treatment groups and the control group b d f. The color of the bars indicates the direction of the metabolic change relative to the control group green significantly increased resonances relative to control group red significantly decreased resonances relative to control group.

The 5-FU and oxaliplatin groups however showed elevated levels of urinary benzoate and decreased levels of hippurate suggesting microbial production of ben- zoate but compromised hippurate formation.

Metabolic changes in serum and urine metabolome were measured with 1 mm proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1H-NMR.Results Irinotecan increased the relative abundance of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria while 5-FU and oxalipl- atin caused only minor changes in the composition of fecal microbiota.

Correlations between the relative abundances of bacterial phyla inverse Simpson index metabolite levels intestinal permeability and body weight change were calculated as Pearson's cor- relations and visualized using the corrplot package .ResultsDrug responseDetailed description of the CIGT and changes in intestinal permeability to the drugs has previously been published in Forsgard et al.

However the change test script with false discovery rate correction FDR in the mare package was used to identify treatment-induced significant changes from baseline in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa between the groups.
