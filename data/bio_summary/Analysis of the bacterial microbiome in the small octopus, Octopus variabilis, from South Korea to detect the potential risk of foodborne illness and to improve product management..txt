The bacterial cells obtained from each sample were diluted in 255 mL ofbuffered peptone water 10 g peptone 5 g sodium chloride 3.5 g dis- odium phosphate 1.5 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate with pH 7.2 and stored at -80 degC before metagenomic DNA extraction.Artificial infection of Vibrio vulnificus on small octopusThe influence of V. vulnificus infection on the indigenous microbiota of small octopuses during storage was analyzed by artificially infecting octopuses with V. vulnificus and stored in sterile containers at 27 degC room temperature and 4 degC.

Comparison of A the number of observed operational taxonomic units OTUs B the Shannon diversity index and C the amount of bacteria in non-infected small octopuses stored at 4 degC 4 degC NI blue circle V. vulnificus-infected octopuses stored at 4 degC 4 degCI red circle non-infected octopuses at 27 degC RTNI blue triangle and infected octopuses stored at 27 degC RTI red triangle.

Further studies are needed to better understand the relation of these genera with geochemical factors in sampling locations and the pathogenicity of potential pathogens in the microbiota of small octopuses in August.Shifts of microbiota composition in small octopuses infected with V. vulnificus over storage timeWe used metagenomics analysis to investigate the effect of V. vul- nificus infection on the indigenous microbiota in octopus samples.

The conditions for the reaction were as follows initial denaturation at 95 degC for 5 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 degC for 15 s annealing at 60 degC for 30 s and extension at 72 degC for 15 s and final extension at 72 degC for 10 min.

The reaction was performed under the following conditions initial denaturation at 95 degC for 3 min 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 degC for 30 s annealing at 55 degC for 30 s and extension at 72 degC for 30 s and final extension at 72 degC for 5 min.

The index PCR was performed under the following conditions initial de- naturation at 95 degC for 3 min 8 cycles of denaturation at 95 degC for 30 s annealing at 55 degC for 30 s and extension at 72 degC for 30 s and final extension at 72 degC for 5 min.

Therefore it is necessary to analyze the effects of Vibrio infection on indigenous microbiota in small octopus before consumption.In this study we investigated the microbiota of small octopuses collected from different sampling sites in August and November using the MiSeq system with the 16S rRNA genes.

P value  0.05  P value  0.01  P value  0.001.potential risk of changes in the microbiota during storage for food processing of small octopus products.ConclusionsThe microbiota of the small octopuses collected in August and November from different sampling sites in Korea was analyzed.

These results in present study could not be generalized the microbiota and the changes of the indigenous microbiota by V. vulnificus infection in the small octopus due to the relatively small number of samples and selected sites.

These results also suggested that the environment influences the microbiota in small octopuses.Comparison of microbiota composition in octopuses at the genus levelThe relative abundances of frequently detected genera  1 of total microbiota in at least one sampling site were compared using heatmap analysis .
