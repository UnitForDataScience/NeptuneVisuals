Each of these proposed indications for FMT is associated with an underlying dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota and generally a clinical response is linked with a restora- tion of the gut microbiota.Summary The potential of fecal microbial transplantation to alter disease course shows promise but further large- scale studies are necessary to understand limitations as well as how best to utilize this therapy.This article is part of the Topical Collection on Intra-abdominal Infections Hepatitis and Gastroenteritis Karen Madsen 1 Cumming School of Medicine University of Calgary Calgary AB Canada2 Department of Medicine CEGIIR Center of Excellence for Gastrointestinal Inflammation and Immunity Research 7-142 Katz Group Center University of Alberta Edmonton AB CanadaKeywords Fecal microbiota transplantation .

Alterations in the gut mi- crobiota are associated with many diseases and research into FMT as a therapy has shown promising results.ConclusionUnderstanding the benefits of FMT will prove difficult with- out explicit reporting of key components of fecal microbiota transplantation research a notion that will enhance research inthe field of fecal microbiota transplants and provide better insight into its utility as a therapeutic agent for indications other than C. difficile infection .

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem and the potential of FMT to modulate antibiotic- resistant microbial populations may play a crucial role in com- bating this issue.Jouhten H Mattila E Arkkila P Satokari R. Reduction of antibiotic resistance genes in intestinal microbiota of patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection after fecal microbiota transplantation.

Furthermore our group demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in reducing the total number of antibiotic resistance genes contained in the gut microbiota of RCDI patients results that were corroborated by Jouhten et al.

Furthermore the differences in the microbiota in certain individuals may change the efficacy of FMTs and must be explored in a de- tailed and scientific manner moving forward.

Although there are few published reports early successes in the treatment of FGID with FMT suggest its potential.Curr Infect Dis Rep 2017 19 31Page 3 of 4 31Pushing the Limits of Fecal Microbial TransplantationThe advent of high-throughput microbial sequencing has en- abled the identification of a plethora of diseases associated with underlying GI microbiota dysbiosis.

To elucidate the influence of the gut microbiota in dis- ease results from Cui and colleagues indicated that FMT in- creased survival of mice following irradiation and may have value in the treatment for radiation-induced GI toxicity .

Additionally it was observed that the microbiota of the ASD patients became more similar to that of neurotypical children following treatment .
