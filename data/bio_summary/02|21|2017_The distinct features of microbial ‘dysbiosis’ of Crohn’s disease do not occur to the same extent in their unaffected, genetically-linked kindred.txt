Notably within the CDR group where faecal calprotectin varied among subjects there was a tendency for the community structure of the gut microbiota of subjects with increased faecal calprotectin to diverge from those with normal levels Bray-Curtis p  0.07 unweighted Unifrac p  0.14  Panel A  B.Both groups CDR and HUC presented a significantly higher both p0.05 microbiota diversity richness and evenness Shannon a-diversity index than CD  Panel D. Between them the microbiota diversity was lower in the CDR compared with the HUC groups p  0.044  Panel D. Results remained the same when analysis was performed considering the genetic relatedness of the participants in CDR and CD groups p  0.039.

Both of these groups HUC and CDR had a higher microbiota a-diversity CDR p  0.026 and HUC p0.001 with a community structure b-diversity distinct from that of children with CD.Crohn's in Childhood Research Association CICRA.

All but two of the CDR participants were living in the same house with their CD relatives and one CD child was related to two participants from the CDR group.

There was no significant cor- relations between the a-diversity index with the concentration of faecal calprotectin in all three groups CD p  0.440 CDR p  0.901 HUC p  0.440.Bacterial taxon relative abundanceThe relative abundance of 89 OTUs were significantly different between the CD and CDR group .

From the 11 OTUs which were assigned to Ruminococcus one differed between CDR and HUC but the direction of this change was opposite to the one reported previously for Ruminococcus torques .Genetic functional capacity and bacterial metabolitesWhen metagenomic reads were assigned to KEGG metabolic pathways with HUMAnN no sig- nificant difference in gene richness equivalents were observed between CDR and HUC  Panel E. None of the metabolic pathways differed between these two groups after adjusting for multiple testing.

In contrast the genetic functional capacity of the CDR and HUC groups was CD vs CDR p  0.047 or tended to be higher CD vs HUC p  0.081 than that of CD and in accordance with our previous research  Panel E .

In pairwise comparison between groups the relative abundance of two KEGG pathways involved in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthe- sis and ribosome function were significantly lower in CD than CDR patients .With regard to SCFA no significant differences were found in the concentration or propor- tional ratio  of any of the three major SCFA between the three groups  Panel F.Among the discriminatory OTUs between CDR with CD the percentage propionate in CD participants was negatively correlated with two OTUs belonging to Veillonella and positively with an OTU from Phascolarctobacterium  a genus which includes species which con- vert succinate to propionate .

However the less diverse microbiota we observed in the CDR participants is in accordance with the results of Hedin et al in siblings of patients with CD .A tendency for the community structure of CDR participants with raised faecal calprotectin to diverge further than those of their counterparts with no colonic inflammation is intriguing and agrees with previous research.
