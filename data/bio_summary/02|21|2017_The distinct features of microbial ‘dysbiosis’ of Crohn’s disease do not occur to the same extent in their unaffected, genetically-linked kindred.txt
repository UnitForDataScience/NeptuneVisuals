both of these groups huc and cdr had a higher microbiota a-diversity cdr p  0.026 and huc p0.001 with a community structure b-diversity distinct from that of children with cd.crohn's in childhood research association cicra.

all but two of the cdr participants were living in the same house with their cd relatives and one cd child was related to two participants from the cdr group.

from the 11 otus which were assigned to ruminococcus one differed between cdr and huc but the direction of this change was opposite to the one reported previously for ruminococcus torques .genetic functional capacity and bacterial metaboliteswhen metagenomic reads were assigned to kegg metabolic pathways with humann no sig- nificant difference in gene richness equivalents were observed between cdr and huc  panel e. none of the metabolic pathways differed between these two groups after adjusting for multiple testing.

in contrast the genetic functional capacity of the cdr and huc groups was cd vs cdr p  0.047 or tended to be higher cd vs huc p  0.081 than that of cd and in accordance with our previous research  panel e .

in pairwise comparison between groups the relative abundance of two kegg pathways involved in aminoacyl-trna biosynthe- sis and ribosome function were significantly lower in cd than cdr patients .with regard to scfa no significant differences were found in the concentration or propor- tional ratio  of any of the three major scfa between the three groups  panel f.among the discriminatory otus between cdr with cd the percentage propionate in cd participants was negatively correlated with two otus belonging to veillonella and positively with an otu from phascolarctobacterium  a genus which includes species which con- vert succinate to propionate .

however the less diverse microbiota we observed in the cdr participants is in accordance with the results of hedin et al in siblings of patients with cd .a tendency for the community structure of cdr participants with raised faecal calprotectin to diverge further than those of their counterparts with no colonic inflammation is intriguing and agrees with previous research.

local contri- bution of b-diversity analysis showed no difference in community structure between the cdr and huc groups.

twenty one of 1243 1.8 operational taxonomic units discrimi- nated cdr from huc.

the metagenomic functional capacity p  0.207 and scfa concen- tration or pattern were similar between cdr and huc p0.05 for all scfa.

we also attempted to reproduce the findings of previous similar research within the dataset produced in the current study.material  methodssubjects  samplesfaecal samples were collected from 17 otherwise healthy first-degree relatives of children with cd cdr and 14 controls unrelated to people with inflammatory bowel disease huc .

a group of 19 children with cd on contemporary treatment 16 of whom were blood-related to the cdr group were used as a benchmark of the faecal 'dys- biosis' characteristics of cd .
