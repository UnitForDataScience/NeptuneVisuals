however liu et al.analyzed the microbial diversity of geese caecum at the class level using 16s rrna clone library approach and the cecal microbiome of geese are dominantly occupied by 58.7 clostridia firmicutes 26.9 bacteroidetes bacteroidetes and 11.2 erysipelotrichi firmicutes showing similar results with the cecal microbiome of chickens.

liu et al.analyzed the geese caecum microbial diversity using 16s rrna clone library approach which are dominantly occupied by clostridia-related species 58.7 followed by bacteroidetes 26.9 and erysipelotrichi 11.2. however the dgge technique fails to accurately represent the gut microbiome due to its low coverage throughput and semi-quantitative features.

cationic antimicrobial peptide camp ascorbate and aldarate metabolism african trypanosomiasis two-component system inositol phosphate metabolism carotenoid biosynthesis seleno compound metabolism bacterial proliferation and colonization e.g.

sulfur relay system and sulfur metabolism energy metabolism methane metabolism respectively.

the results indicated that the most abundant functional categories were associated with amino acid metabolism sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism fatty acid degradation energy metabolism immunity and signal transduction bacterial proliferation and colonization.

additionally this observation was in agreement with a recent study by jami et al.
