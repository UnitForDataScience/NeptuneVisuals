moreover the three s. cerevisiae isolates were found positive to the amylase activity assay a trait which has been scarcely in- vestigated in s. cerevisiae sourdough isolates.

c. milleri was the prevalent species in our samples representing 96 of the isolates iden- tified whereas s. cerevisiae represented the remaining 4. such dataisolateslactic acid bacteriaima 1 lab 3 5-13 17-21 23-26 28-38 40-4951 52 56-58 60-62 64 66-75 77-82 84-8688-92 94-96 99phytase protease amylaseactivity activity activity---supplement those obtained from pagnotta del dittaino pdo sourdoughwhere a yeast other than s. cerevisiae c. humilis was the only dominant species recovered  which occurred in association with the lab species l. sanfranciscensis and enterococcus durans .

the dendrogram created by combining the three different ardra profiles grouped the isolates into two main clusters with a similarity level of 89.9. the first one consisted of 49 isolates which clustered at similarity level of 100 with the reference strain l. sanfranciscensis dsmz 20451 and of the isolate ima 23lab which separately branched at similarity of 95.2. the remaining 46 isolates showing 100 similar- ity grouped in the second cluster .

however further investigations are needed in order to exploit the most important functional properties of yeast sourdough isolates for the production of baked goods.the molecular identification of the selected 96 lab was carried out by ardra and sequence analysis.

as due to the very recent designation the microbiota of tuscan bread sourdough has not been investigated so far the aim of the present work was to isolate and characterize the species composition of lab and yeasts of pdo tus- can bread sourdough by culture-independent and dependent methods.

the sequences were submitted to the european nucleotide archive under the acces- sion numbers from lt605080 to lt605156 and from lt718652 to lt718656.molecular characterization of pdo tuscan bread sourdough by pcr- dggedna was extracted from the three pdo tuscan bread sourdough samples by using power soil dna isolation kit mo-bio laboratories according to the manufacturer's protocol and stored at -20 degc until fur- ther analyses.for the analysis of lab communities the v3-v4 region of 16s rrna gene was amplified with the lac1 5'-agc agt agg gaa tct tcc a- 3' and lac2 5'-att yca ccg cta cac atg-3' primers  .

ninety six lab from mmrs medium and 68 yeasts from wln medium were randomly selected and molecu- larly characterized at species level.molecular identification of lab and yeast isolatesthe 96 lab and 68 yeasts selected were molecularly identified by ardra and pcr-rflp analysis of the its region respectively and se- quencing.

all bacterial isolates showed 99 identity with lactobacillus sanfranciscensis 65 yeast isolates were identified as can- dida milleri and 3 as saccharomyces cerevisiae.
