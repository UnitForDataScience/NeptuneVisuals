Ruminant diets with their diverse digestible ingredients are known to be one of the key factors shaping the rumen microbiome de Menezes et al.

Petri et al.

Ji et al.

Additionally commonly used con- centrate feeds largely contain human-edible grains thus their production and feeding to livestock competes with human food availability Ertl et al.

Ruminants which can utilise fibrous carbohydrates like cellulose due to the symbiotic relationship with the complex rumen microbial communities do not per se depend on the supply of concentrate feeds and thus originally do not compete with humans for human edible products or arable land Taube et al.

Recent studies have also shown that feeding high-grain diets al- ters the rumen microbial population in favour of amylolytic and lactic acid-producing populations at the expense of fibrolytic microbes Fernando et al.

Petri et al.

McCann et al.

In the end these strong shifts in the rumen microbiome can cause a depression of nutrient degradation especially fibrePourazad et al.

Such hay would increase the energy intake of cows while reducing the proportion of starch-rich grains in the diet Kleefisch et al.
