In FRL high correlations were found be- tween relative abundances of Pyramidobacter and Desulfovibrio r  0.703 P  0.001 and Pyramidobacter and Methanobrevibac- ter r  0.616 P  0.001 respectively as well as between Se-lenomonas NCBI BLASTn hit to 100 as Selenomonas ruminantium and Anaerovibrio r  0.742 P  0.001 Ruminococcus r  0.687 P  0.001 and Succiniclasticum r  0.583 P  0.001.

Ruminococcus positively correlated with Pseudobutyrivibrio r  0.580 P  0.001 and Treponema correlated positively with Fibrobacter r  0.712 P  0.001.Correlation of bacterial abundance and ruminal pH were found only in the solid particle fraction with negativecorrelations for Prevotella r  -0.492 P  0.004 and Ruminococcus r  -0.529 P  0.002 and a positive correlation with BF311 r  0.374 P  0.035.DISCUSSIONSeveral studies have investigated the effects of starch feeding on ruminal microbes.

The significance level was set at P  0.05 and a trend was considered when 0.05  P  0.10.RESULTSFeed intake and ruminal concentration of ammonia and SCFAData of feed intake and ruminal pH has been reported previ- ously Kleefisch et al.

Contrast analyses revealed a linear decrease for propionate P  0.015 and butyrate P  0.001 but a linear increasing effect for acetate P  0.048 and iso-butyrate P  0.001 with increas- ing high-sugar hay proportion.In situ nutrient degradationResults of the ruminal degradation of DM OM CP and NDF of the two different hays are shown in Table S3 Supporting In- formation.

Concentrations of the individual SCFA were all affected by diet P  0.001 time P  0.001 and rumen digesta fraction P  0.001 whereby differences among the high- sugar hay diets were small Fig.

Prevotella negatively correlated with BF311 r -0.645 P  0.001 and Fibrobacter r  -0.595 P  0.001 and posi-tively correlated with Sharpea r  0.585 P  0.001.
