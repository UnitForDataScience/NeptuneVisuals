Each mouse was individually housed in a cage and all mice were randomly divided into four groups of 10 mice each 1 PEP low-dose group LP mice were orally administered a PEP dose of 0.2 g per kg body weight 2 PEP middle-dose group MP mice were orally administered a PEP dose of 0.4 g per kg body weight 3 PEP high-dose group HP mice were orally administered a PEP dose of 0.8 g per kg body weight 4 control group Blank mice were given distilled water of the same volume as the average value volume of the PEP treated group.

Moreover the fecal microbiota in the PEP treated group was found to be structurally different compared to the control group especially the Porphyromonadaceae Rikenellaceae Bacteroidaceae and Lactobacillaceae abun- dances were all increased at the family level.

3A that the acetic acid concen- tration in the cecum contents of the high-dose PEP dose group 12.52 - 1.95 mmol L-1 was significantly P  0.05 increased compared to the control group 5.67 - 1.30 mmol L-1.

Different lowercase letters mean signifi- cant difference P  0.05 of the contents in the cecum and capital letters mean significant difference P  0.05 of the contents in the colon.0.16 mmol L-1 in the HP group which was significantly different P  0.05 from the control group.

However the concentrations of i-valeric in the PEP high dose group increased significantly not only in the cecum con- tents 2.02 - 0.19 mmol L-1 but also in the colon contents 0.71 - 0.16 mmol L-1 P  0.05 while i-valeric in the cecum and colon contents of the control group were only 1.24 -0.09 mmol L-1 and 0.19 - 0.04 mmol L-1 respectively.3.3 pH value and moisture contents of luminal contents in the colon and cecumAs shown in Fig.

5A shows the microbiota taxonomic compo- sition at the phylum level Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were the main dominant phyla the relative abundance of Firmicutes significantly decreased whereas the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased in the high-dose PEP group compared to the control group P  0.05.

The microbiota composition differences at the family level between the PEP administered administration group and the control group are shown in Fig.
