interestingly a majority of subjects in the ow and ob groups were found to have similar proportions of enterotype bacter- oides 68.18 and 71.72 whereas hv subjects were found to have much more bacteroides than the other two groups 96.principal coordinates analysis and network analysis in hv ow and ob groupsbased on the relative abundance of genera we performed a principal coordinates analysis and demonstrated separation in bacterial com- munity composition among the three groups by using the first three principal component scores of pc1 pc2 and pc3 37.2314.87 and 14.15 of the explained variance respectively r2 5 0.020 p 5 0.003 supporting information figure s5a-s5c.

on the other hand the relative abundance of the four dominant phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacte- ria and fusobacteria was a common feature in the ob ow and hv groups 29. interestingly at the phylum level there was a sig- nificantly higher abundance of proteobacteria in the ob group ascompared with the hv and ow groups.

no significant difference was observed among the hv ow and ob groups with respect to the overall microbial composition at the phyla level firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla in all three groups figure 1a.
