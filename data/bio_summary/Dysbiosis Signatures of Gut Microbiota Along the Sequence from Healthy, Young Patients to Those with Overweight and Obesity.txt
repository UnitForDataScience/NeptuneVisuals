AN is the most common dermatological manifestation in individuals with obesity besides other metabolic disorders such as diabetes hyperlipidemia hyperinsulinemia and insulin resist- ance 15.However to date the differential distribution of the gut microbiota and its potential association with metabolic markers of obesity have rarely been investigated.

Therefore the findings of the study will help improve our under- standing of the role of the gut microbiota in metabolic functions and will facilitate the development of bacteria-related novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions for obesity and related metabolic diseases.ConclusionOur study demonstrated a significant alteration of the gut microbiota in obesity.

Dysbiosis Signatures of Gut Microbiota Along the Sequence from Healthy Young Patients to Those with Overweight and ObesityRenyuan Gao12 Cuiling Zhu3 Hao Li12 Mingming Yin12 Cheng Pan12 Linsheng Huang12 Cheng Kong12 Xingchun Wang3 Yi Zhang3 Shen Qu3 and Huanlong Qin12Objective To investigate the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers HVs patients with overweight OW and patients with obesity OB including those with acanthosis nigricans AN or without AN N-AN.Methods Microbial 16S rRNA genes were examined by using pyrosequencing technology and analyzed by using bioinformatics methods.Results Subjects in the OW and OB groups showed severe disturbances in glycemic control lipid profile and inflammatory markers all P  0.05 patients with AN had worse metabolic status P  0.001 and a lower diversity of microbiota P  0.05.

Function prediction revealed a significant increase in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and bacterial invasion of epithe- lial cell-associated genes and a significant decrease in glucose and essential amino acid-related genes.Conclusions Gut microbiotas and their functions were significantly changed in obesity.

More prospec- tive studies on association and causality between microbiota and obesity are imperative and might con- tribute to the prevention diagnosis and treatment of obesity.Obesity 2018 26 351-361. doi10.1002oby.22088IntroductionObesity arises from complex interactions between genetic and envi- ronmental factors and is a consequence of a prolonged imbalance between energy intake and expenditure 1.

Prevention and treatment of obesity are typically challenging owing to its multifactorial causa- tion.

In humans the gut microbiota the trillions of bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that has coevolved with its host which is considered as a key factor in the development of obesity.
