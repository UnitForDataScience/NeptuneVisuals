For example Escherichia-Shigella displayed a positive correlation with BMI r 5 0.147 P 5 0.007 waist circumfer-ence r 5 0.195 P 5 0.008 fasting blood glucose r 5 0.069P 5 1.33 3 1025 and blood glucose at all time points all P  0.01.

In the OB group beneficial microbiotas including Bifidobacterium 0.01 vs. 0.05 false discov- ery rate FDR 5 4.271025 anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium 6.70 vs. 13.82 FDR 5 0.010 and butyrate-producing Ruminococcaceae were significantly decreased whereas Bacillus 0.58 vs. 0.04 FDR 5 0.013 and potential opportunistic pathogens such as Fusobacterium 1.44 vs. 0.11 FDR  0.01and Escherichia-Shigella 6.01 vs. 0.76 FDR 5 0.041 had outgrown dramatically.

Interestingly a majority of subjects in the OW and OB groups were found to have similar proportions of enterotype Bacter- oides 68.18 and 71.72 whereas HV subjects were found to have much more Bacteroides than the other two groups 96.Principal coordinates analysis and network analysis in HV OW and OB groupsBased on the relative abundance of genera we performed a principal coordinates analysis and demonstrated separation in bacterial com- munity composition among the three groups by using the first three principal component scores of PC1 PC2 and PC3 37.2314.87 and 14.15 of the explained variance respectively R2 5 0.020 P 5 0.003 Supporting Information Figure S5A-S5C.

In addition Fusobacterium showed a close relation-ship with 60-minute insulin levels r 5 0.280 P 5 5.18 3 1028.Functional prediction in obesity by using PICRUStTo evaluate the functional alteration of gut microbiota in obesity we determined the predicted function by using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States PICRUSt software based on the COG Phylogenetic Classi- fication of Proteins Encoded in Complete Genomes and KEGG Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases.

13.82 FDR 5 0.010 and butyrate-producing microorganisms such as RuminococcaceaeUCG-005 RuminococcaceaeUCG-002 Rumino- coccaceaeUCG-003 RuminococcaceaeUCG-010 and Ruminococca- ceaeUCG-014 all FDR  0.1 decreased whereas Bacillus 0.58 vs. 0.04 FDR 5 0.013 Fusobacterium 1.44 vs. 0.11 FDR  0.01Escherichia-Shigella 6.01 vs. 0.76 FDR 5 0.041 and Pseudomonas0.07 vs. 0.00 FDR 5 0.017 showed a significant increase.

Beneficial microbes such as Faecalibacterium showed a negative relationship with BMI r 5 20.216 P  0.001 and WHR r 5 20.237 P  0.001 as well as fasting blood glucose r 5 20.149 P 5 0.014 and blood glucose at various time points all P  0.01.

RuminococcaceaeUCG-002 showed a negative relationship with BMI r 5 20.217 P 5 0.005 and WHR r 5 20.154 P 5 0.006.In contrast candidate pathogens showed a positive relationship with some clinical variables.

Fusobacterium and Bacillus showed a positive association with 30- minute insulin levels r 5 0.143 P 5 8.55 3 1025 r 5 0.021P 5 4.68 3 1025.
