the mice were ran- domly divided into 12 groups of 8 normal saline consti- pation control loperamide 70 mg per kg body weight bw three groups administered different doses of fos gos and imo 800 mg per kg bw 4 g per kg bw or 8 g per kg bw of fos95 gos90 or imo90 giving a total of 9 oligosaccharide- treated groups and a positive drug control group  phenol- phthalein 70 mg per kg bw ref.

the high- mid- and low-dose fos95 gos90 and imo90 groups received 0.3 ml of 8 g per kg bw4 g per kg bw or 800 mg per kg bw oligosaccharide solutions respectively in the same manner as the control group for 14 days.

after constipation was induced the relative abundance of firmicutes in the control groups decreased from 53.19 to 33.32 compared with the normal group and the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased significantly from 38.83 to 56.03 compared with the normal group table 3 p  0.05. compared with the consti- pation control group the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes increased significantly in most of the oligosaccharide-treated groups except for the high- and medium-dose imo groups and the low-dose gos group fig.

26. a dose of 5 g day-1 is the recommended dietary allowance of prebiotics for a human being weighing 60 kg which is equivalent to 0.083 g per d per kg bw.

the control and treatment groups were treated with lopera- mide 10 mg per kg bw 0.3 ml via gavage from day 15 to day 17 to induce constipation.27 fecal water content the time to the first black stool defecation gi transit the rate of carbon powder propulsion through the small intestine scfas and gut microbiota in the feces were measured.

meanwhile there were no statistical differ- ences between the oligosaccharide treatment groups and the constipated control group in the observed species and phyloge- netic diversity index except for the phenolphthalein and low- dose fos groups fig.
