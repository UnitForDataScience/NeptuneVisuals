the findings from the study will provide valuable in- formation for more effective fertilization strategies to improve rice productivity and development of beneficial consortia as foliar agents to combat abiotic or biotic stress.material and methodsexperimental site and samplingsampling for the present study was undertaken during the 2015 growing season from rice varieties grown at the rice breeding and genetics research centre rbgrc regional station icar- indian agricultural research institute iari located inside the campus of tamil nadu rice research institute trri at aduthurai latitude of 11deg00' n and longitude of 79deg 28'e altitude of 19.5 m above mean sea level.

contrasting re- ports on the impact of plant genotype on phyllosphere microflora exist  however no such studies using different rice genotypes is published to our knowledge.in the present study the phyllosphere diversity from seven different rice cultivars growing in a common habitat was evaluated.

nutrients and host attributes modulate the abundance and functional traits of phyllosphere microbiome in riceshobit thapa radha prasanna kunal ranjan kulandaivelu velmourougane balasubramanian ramakrishnandivision of microbiology icar-indian agricultural research institute new delhi 110012 indiaa r t i c l e i n f o keywordsculturable communities leaf nutrientsplant growth promotion ricesoil nutrientsa b s t r a c t the abundance of phyllosphere bacterial communities of seven genotypes of rice adt- 38 adt-43 cr-1009 pb- 1 ps-5 p-44 and pb-1509 was investigated in relation to nutrient dynamics of rhizosphere and leaves.

the major aim of undertaking the present study is i to characterize the bacterial abundance in the phyllosphere of different rice cultivars and annotate their functional traits and ii to analogize the soil nutrient status to the nutrient availability in leaves in relation to the bacterial abundance and their traits.

this ob-servation raises several questions - is the higher abundance ofsiderophore producers recorded in the r2a medium a reflection of the oligotrophic nature of the niche or is the high fe content in individual varieties the result of the abundance of siderophore producers or is the observed trend the result of complex interactions between these as- pects microbial production of siderophores and their role in fe che- lation is well studied in other niches further studies on the role and mechanisms engaged by the phyllosphere siderophore producers to convert the available micronutrient from phyllosphere to survive under low nutrient environment may provide further insights into phyllo- sphere-nutrient-microbe interactions.the most common auxin produced by microorganisms showing plant growth promoting traits is indole acetic acid iaa which is re- sponsible for the better colonization of the inhabitants on the plant surface .

micronutrient analyses of the leaf samples showed that the zinc content varied between 142-250 mg g-1 dry matter iron content ranged from 195 to 486 mg g-1 dry matter copper content was 14-70 mg g-1 dry matter and manganese content varied between 63-136 mg g-1 dry matter.

the role of sugars and other exudates have been investigated   however no focused studies towards understanding the nutrient feedback loops between soil and leaves and how they can modulate the functional attributes of phyllosphere bacterial commu- nities is published to our knowledge particularly in rice.

in general phyllosphere is a low nutrient niche wherein mi- crobes which have adapt to low nutrient conditions oligotrophs in- habit.

from the pca  it is clear that there exists a good relationship between the leaf and soil nutrient content of the seven rice varieties and its significant influence on culturable phyllospheric microbial population.siderophores are low molecular weight iron chelating ligands syn- thesized by microorganisms .

in many instances negative correlation between phyllospheric microbial population and leaf nutrient content indicates crop compro- mise between plant nutrient and specific microbial group selection.

micronutrient analyses of the soil samples showed that zinc content ranged between 1.12-3.74 mg g-1 soil iron content ranged between 4.7-12 mg g-1 soil copper contentranged between 7.3-11 mg g-1 soil and manganese content was be- tween 9.5-34 mg g-1 soil.

cultivar differences in rice can influence community structure in the rhizosphere  as well as in the phyllosphere .
