This ob-servation raises several questions - is the higher abundance ofsiderophore producers recorded in the R2A medium a reflection of the oligotrophic nature of the niche or is the high Fe content in individual varieties the result of the abundance of siderophore producers or is the observed trend the result of complex interactions between these as- pects Microbial production of siderophores and their role in Fe che- lation is well studied in other niches further studies on the role and mechanisms engaged by the phyllosphere siderophore producers to convert the available micronutrient from phyllosphere to survive under low nutrient environment may provide further insights into phyllo- sphere-nutrient-microbe interactions.The most common auxin produced by microorganisms showing plant growth promoting traits is indole acetic acid IAA which is re- sponsible for the better colonization of the inhabitants on the plant surface .

Circle 1 represents the first group wherein the variables exhibited positive control over the microbial population in R2A medium Circle 2 represents the second group wherein the variables exhibited positive control over the microbial population in NA medium Circle 3 represents the third group wherein the soil variables exhibited negative control over the microbial population in NA or R2A medium Chl a Chlorophyll a Chl b Chlorophyll a Carot Carotenoids OC Soil organic carbon Leaf-N Leaf Nitrogen Leaf- P Leaf Phosphorus Leaf- Zn Leaf Zinc Leaf- Fe Leaf Iron Leaf- Cu Leaf Copper Leaf- Mn Leaf- Manganese Soil- N Soil Nitrogen Soil- P Soil Phosphorus Soil- Zn Soil Zinc Soil- Fe Soil Iron Soil- Cu Soil Copper Soil- Mn Soil- Manganese CFU Colony forming Unit Log10 g-1 leaf fw NA Nutrient Agar R2A Reasoner's 2A agar.surface of the leaf like UV radiations desiccation nutrient scarcity wind and many other biotic and abiotic factors  .The highly spatial heterogeneous nature of nutrient availability on leaves is well understood.

Micronutrient analyses of the leaf samples showed that the zinc content varied between 142-250 mg g-1 dry matter iron content ranged from 195 to 486 mg g-1 dry matter copper content was 14-70 mg g-1 dry matter and manganese content varied between 63-136 mg g-1 dry matter.

Micronutrient analyses of the soil samples showed that zinc content ranged between 1.12-3.74 mg g-1 soil iron content ranged between 4.7-12 mg g-1 soil copper contentranged between 7.3-11 mg g-1 soil and manganese content was be- tween 9.5-34 mg g-1 soil.

The phyllosphere samples from all the varieties except ADT-43 showed significantly higher counts in NA medium.Nutrient status of soilOrganic carbon content in soil samples varied between 1.01-1.34 which increased from 10 to 15 over the 0 day values.

The chlorophyll content of rice varieties maybe a function of the plant physiology and genetic lineage and their interactions with their respective micro- biomes.

The number of colony forming units on two different types of media showed significant dif- ferences among the varieties with highest values being recorded in Nutrient Agar in all the varieties.

Seven dif- ferent rice varieties were sampled three of which were local varieties namely ADT-38 ADT-43 and CR-1009 whereas other were national released varieties namely Pusa Basmati 1 PB-1 Pusa Sugandh 5 PS- 5 Pusa 44 P-44 and Pusa Basmati 1509 PB-1509.

From the PCA  it is clear that there exists a good relationship between the leaf and soil nutrient content of the seven rice varieties and its significant influence on culturable phyllospheric microbial population.Siderophores are low molecular weight iron chelating ligands syn- thesized by microorganisms .

The major aim of undertaking the present study is i to characterize the bacterial abundance in the phyllosphere of different rice cultivars and annotate their functional traits and ii to analogize the soil nutrient status to the nutrient availability in leaves in relation to the bacterial abundance and their traits.
