the control group was fed with a low fat lf diet with 10 kcal from fat d12450b research diets inc.. this 60 kcal hf with the control 10 kcal lf diet is widely used for diet-induced obesity 20 the diet compositions of hf and lf are shown in table .table 1 the compositions of high fat and low fat diets used in this study.

our data demonstrated that alterations of gut micro- biota were accompanied with the changes of paneth cell- antimicrobial peptides but preceded the elevations of cir- culating inflammatory cytokines in high fat diet-induced obese mice indicating that high fat diet induces alterations of microbiota which may stimulate intestinal inflammation even before the influence from circulating inflammatory cytokines that were produced in adipose tissue.

conclusionsin summary the data from our time-course hf feeding animal study clearly demonstrated that hf altered gut micro- bial communities corresponding with the changes of paneth cell-antimicrobial peptides but prior to the elevations of circulating inflammatory cytokines indicating that high fat diet induces alterations of microbiota which may stimulate intestinal inflammation even before the influence from circu- lating inflammatory cytokines that were produced in adipose tissue elsewhere in the body.

however it remains to be defined whether diet-induced obesity exacerbates the intestinal inflammatory status by cytokines produced in adipose tissue or the high fat diet first alters the gut microbiota and then drives intestinal inflammation.

a high fat hf diet with 60 kcal from fat d12492 research diets inc. was used to induce obesity with 8 c57bl6 male animals sacrificed at 8 12 and 16 weeks of feeding.

recently several studies including our own suggest that an inflammatory milieu resides in the colon of obese animals  although inflammatory cytokines produced in adipose tissue can circulate to theintestinal epithelial layer a local inflammatory response to the changes of microenvironment for example microbiota in the intestine might also play a critical role in promoting intestinal inflammation and thereby contributing to gastroin- testinal diseases.

based on the data of 4 phyla a and 8 generab examined the gut microflora were significantly altered after 8 wk feeding of a high fat diet and no significantly alterations occurred for means there were significant changes  between hf and lf groups.the firmicutes and decreased the bacteroidetes comparing with the lf group  but no further significant change in these phyla was observed after 12 or 16 wk hf feeding figure at the genus level a similar pattern was observed the gut microflora was altered after 8 wk hf feeding but no further significant changes were observed in the microbial composition.

b at the genus level the abundance of lactobacillus was positively associated with body weight whereas the abundance of turicibacter was negatively associated with body weight.1.61.20.80.40.0lfhf-12 wnot observe significant changes for the 8 wk and 12 wk hf groups when comparing to the 8 wk lf group whereas theand tnf- in the 16 wk hf animals were significantly increased when compared to the lf group figure a indicating the changes of serum inflammatory cytokines were later than the changes of gut microflora which occurred at 8 weeks of hf feeding as described above.

the findings emphasized the importance of microbiota in addition to adipose tissue per se in driving intestinal inflammation in an obese state.a close relationship between the intestinal microbiota and obesity has been demonstrated in both human and animals with a large shift in microbiota favoring the presence of firmicutes and suppressing bacteroidetes in obesity  .

since the gonadal fat pad can be more precisely dissected than other fat pads we weighed gonadal fat pad and calculated the percentage of it over the total body weight to approximately examine the effect of hf on the fat composition.
