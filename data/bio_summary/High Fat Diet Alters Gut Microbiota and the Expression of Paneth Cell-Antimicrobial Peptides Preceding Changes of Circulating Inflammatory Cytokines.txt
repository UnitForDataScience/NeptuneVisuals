Our data demonstrated that alterations of gut micro- biota were accompanied with the changes of Paneth cell- antimicrobial peptides but preceded the elevations of cir- culating inflammatory cytokines in high fat diet-induced obese mice indicating that high fat diet induces alterations of microbiota which may stimulate intestinal inflammation even before the influence from circulating inflammatory cytokines that were produced in adipose tissue.

ConclusionsIn summary the data from our time-course HF feeding animal study clearly demonstrated that HF altered gut micro- bial communities corresponding with the changes of Paneth cell-antimicrobial peptides but prior to the elevations of circulating inflammatory cytokines indicating that high fat diet induces alterations of microbiota which may stimulate intestinal inflammation even before the influence from circu- lating inflammatory cytokines that were produced in adipose tissue elsewhere in the body.

However it remains to be defined whether the alteration in gut microbial composition results directly from the HF per se or from the altered intesti-promoted inflammatory status by the circulating cytokines.after 8 weeks of HF feeding and reduced expressions of lysozyme and Reg III- were observed after 12 weeks of HF feeding indicating that the alteration of Paneth antimicrobial peptides was secondary to the shift of microbiota whereas alterations of circulating inflammatory cytokines IFN and were only observed after 16 weeks of HF feedingnal microenvironment in an obese state for example theThe present study demonstrated that the alterations of the gut microbial composition occurred prior to the elevation of circulated inflammatory cytokines indicating HF directly influences gut microbial composition.

To address this question we fed C57BL6 mice with a high fat diet HF 60 and sacrificed them sequentially after 8 12 and 16 weeks and then compositions of gut microbiota and expressions of antimicrobial peptides werepeptides lysozyme and Reg III after 12 and 16 wk HF feeding  whereas elevations of circulating inflammatory cytokinesIFN were observed until feeding a HF diet for 16 weeks   0.05.

Among the 4 cytokines examined except for IFN  the mRNA expressions of TNF-  IL-1  and IL-6 were significantly enhanced at least in one of the three HF groups when compared to the control group fed with a LF diet for 8 weeks.1.00.80.60.40.20.0IFNIL-1IL-2 LFHF-12 w121086420LFHF-12 w1.41.21.00.80.60.40.20.0HF-8w HF-16 wa1412108642HF-8w HF-16 w2025IFN3035404550Body weight g20253035404550Body weight gTNFIFN predictedbTNF- predictedFigure 6 Effect of high fat diet consumption on circulating inflammatory cytokine profile.

A high fat HF diet with 60 kcal from fat D12492 Research Diets Inc. was used to induce obesity with 8 C57BL6 male animals sacrificed at 8 12 and 16 weeks of feeding.

Based on the data of 4 phyla a and 8 generab examined the gut microflora were significantly altered after 8 wk feeding of a high fat diet and no significantly alterations occurred for means there were significant changes  between HF and LF groups.the Firmicutes and decreased the Bacteroidetes comparing with the LF group  but no further significant change in these phyla was observed after 12 or 16 wk HF feeding Figure At the genus level a similar pattern was observed the gut microflora was altered after 8 wk HF feeding but no further significant changes were observed in the microbial composition.

However it remains to be defined whether diet-induced obesity exacerbates the intestinal inflammatory status by cytokines produced in adipose tissue or the high fat diet first alters the gut microbiota and then drives intestinal inflammation.
