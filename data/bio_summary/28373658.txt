HFD significantly increased the abundance of Clostridia and Deltaproteobacteria in both WT and Nod2-- mice and also Deferribacteres in Nod2-- mice whereas LFD significantly increased the abundance of Bacteroida Bacilli and Erysipelotrichia in both WT and Nod2-- mice and also Candidatus saccharibacteria in WT mice.At other taxonomic levels significant differences in abundance in the following numbers of orders families genera species and OTUs out of total of 27 47 109 223 and 4425 were detected between WT HFD and Nod2-- HFD mice 2 2 9 26 and 548 between WT LFD and Nod2-- LFD mice 6 10 20 46 and 601 betweenWT HFD and WT LFD 8 14 24 48 and 535 and between Nod2-- HFD and Nod2-- LFD mice 6 9 16 35 and 288 respectively NCBI SRA accession No.

but no significant difference in glucose compared with control Nod2-- mice on HFD alone.Thus our results demonstrate that the gut microbiota in Nod2-- HFD mice is required for the development of diet-dependent obesity steatosis and hyperlipidemia in Nod2-- mice and that long-term treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics abolishes weight gain and several aspects of metabolic dysfunction.Intestinal microbiota from Nod2-- mice on high fat diet increases sensitivity to obesity.

WT HFD mice had significantly increased abundance of Epsilonproteobacteria compared with Nod2-- HFD mice and Nod2-- HFD mice had significantly increased abundance of Deferribacteres compared with WT HFD mice.

The effect of Nod2 deletion on HFD-induced obesity is strain-dependent as Nod2-- and WT C57BL6 mice on HFD gain similar weight but Nod2-- C57BL6 mice exhibit more severe insulin resist- ancethan Nod2-- BALBc mice.

These data indicate that the larger LDs in Nod2-- HFD mice compared with WT HFD mice are accompa- nied by changes in lipid metabolizing enzymes and in vesicle trafficking proteins.Nod2-- mice on HFD had enlarged adipocytes with significantly larger area than WT HFD mice Fig.

Thus our results demonstrate that Nod2-- HFD mice develop hyperlipidemia hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance which are hallmark manifestations of metabolic syndrome in humans.To determine any differences in the total energy extracted from food between Nod2-- HFD mice and WT HFD mice we measured the total calories present in the stool samples of these mice.
