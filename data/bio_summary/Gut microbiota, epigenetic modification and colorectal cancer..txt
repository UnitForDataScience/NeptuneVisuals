For instance the expres- sion of miR-4478 and miR-1295b-3p were strongly reduced in stool samples of CRC patient with early stage I and II in comparison with healthy individ- uals 68.It is also demonstrated that the expression levels of plasma miR -142-3p and miR -26a-5p were signifi- cantly diminished in patients with colorectal cancer in comparison with normal subjects 69.Seven miRNAs were found to be under expressed in both plasma and stool samples of patients with CRC compared with healthy individuals.

Although the vast research- es aimed at intending DNA methylation in CRC de- velopment far fewer is known about the potential association of aberrant histone post translational modifications to the CRC imitation and progression even metastasis 81.The relationship between histone deacetylation and DNA methylation in cancer initiation was reported previously.
