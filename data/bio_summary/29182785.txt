nine studies focused on enterobacteriaceae four reported an increase and five studies reported unchanged composition after antibiotic treatment mainly ampicillin plus an aminoglyco- side figure a. five studies focused on different commensal obligate anaerobes showing a clear trend towards reduced colonization rates following treatment figure b.in the five studies focusing on clostridia there were equivocal results figure c.finally four studies focused on gram-positive cocci and these studies showed either unchanged or higher colonization rates after antibiotic treat- ment figure d.two studies n  983 reported enterobacteriaceae coloniza- tion rates after treatment with broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotics.both studies found lower colonization rates follow- ing third-generation cephalosporin treatment.

the remaining 23 studies assessed only one category of antibiotic therapy.nine studies reported on both infections and colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteriawhereas 15 studies only reported on colonization-- and 7 studies only reported on infections.mdr bacteria were varyingly defined as bacteria that were resistant to both third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosidesor bacteria resistant to 22 or 23 unrelated classes of antibiotics.-573antibiotic exposure - compared with no antibiotic exposure 9 studies 2509 neonatesstudyinfection andor colonization ratesrisk estimatesspecific outcomescolonizationlowerunchangedhigheror infectioncrivaro 2007not availableesbl-producing s. marcescens colonizationduman 2005rr 14.05 95 ci 1.19-164.62esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae colonizationkumar 2014or 26.04 95 ci 3.51-35.45carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii infectionmillar 2008not availablemdr enterobacteriaceaecolonizationrettedal 2013or 5.5 95 ci 5.6-15.3esbl-producing k. pneumoniaecolonizationsehgal 2007or 17.80 95 ci 1.91-165.54 esbl-producing gram-negativeinfectionwe graded qoe as moderate owing to inclusion of observational studies with large effect estimates.antibiotic exposure - long duration compared with shorter duration 5 studies 4281 neonatesstudyinfection andor colonization ratesrisk estimatesspecific outcomescolonizationlowerunchangedhigheror infectioncrivaro 2007or 1.32 95 ci 1.02-1.70esbl-producing s. marcescens colonizationwe graded qoe as moderate owing to inclusion of observational studies that demonstrated a dose-response effect.

forty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria 3 rcts published between 2000 and 2013and 45 observationalstudies published between 1974 and 2016 figure .--two articles presented data from the same study population and were defined as one study.antibiotic treatment was the randomized intervention in two out of the three included rcts.among the 45 observational studies there were 22 prospective cohort studies 12 case-control studies 7 before-after studies and 4 retrospective cohort studies.

it is possible that neonatal antibiotic therapy regardless of treatment length leads to decreased microbial diversity but the studies included in this category were small and two out of four studies did not detect a significant difference.575second four out of nine studies reported increased abundance andor colonization rates of enterobacteriaceae following neona- tal antibiotic treatment whereas none of the studies reported reduced abundance.in the majority of these studies the empirical regimens consisted of ampicillin and genta- micin.

we excluded case reports and case series studies with a non-neonatal or non-human popula- tion studies that were written in languages other than english and studies that investigated antenatal antibiotics oral antibiotics andor low-dose intravenous vancomycin prophylaxis.screening data extraction and managementtwo reviewers j. w. f. and e. e. independently screened search results and assessed each potentially eligible study per our predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

one study n  584 found a higher rate of prior antibiotic treatment in neo- nates colonized with antibiotic-resistant escherichia coli andor klebsiella pneumoniae.one study n  953 found an increased incidence of tem-1 genes in e. coli strains in neonates following antibiotic therapy.two studies n  288 found no statistically significant associations between antibiotic treatment yes versus no and subsequent antibiotic resistance development.two studies compared the impact of antibiotic therapy duration one of them n  1180 found significantly longer prior antibiotic treatment among neonates colonized with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteriawhereas the other unknown number of neonates found no correlation between the duration of treat- ment and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.eight studies n  3029 compared the impact of broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic treatment.one rct n  276 found higher colonization rates with ampicillin-resistanta.

study protocol registration prospero crd42015026743.results we included 48 studies comprising 3 rcts and 45 observational studies.

we included both observational studies and randomized controlled tri- als rcts in line with suggestions from the cochrane handbook stating that systematic reviews of adverse effects will usually need to include non-randomized studies in addition to rcts.methodsthis review was reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses following a registered protocol and according to the recommendations given by the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews and interventions.-we recently published a sys- tematic review on early clinical adverse effects of neonatal antibiotic treat- ment based on the same research protocol.for this review our primary research question was 'are different categories of antibiotic treatment in neonates associated with different changes in gut microbiota composition andor differences in antibiotic resistance development'study protocol registration prospero crd42015026743.search strategywe developed our search strategy in consultation with an epidemiologist a librarian a paediatric pharmacologist and a neonatologist.

both rcts and observa- tional studies such as cohort case-control and cross-sectional studies were eligible for inclusion.

we extracted the following information from included studies author year country study design study population including gestational age ga and birth weight bw comparison of out- comes between groups with different categories of antibiotic treatment and if available risk estimates with 95 ci for the specific outcome.gut microbiota analyses were based on faecal samples using both standard culture-based methods and culture-independent methods rely- ing on dna amplification and sequencing.after reviewing the articles pre- senting data on gut microbiota we decided to present data from these studies in three main categories microbial load microbial diversity and microbial composition clearly acknowledging some overlap between these categories.

the risk of detection bias was considered high in570figure 1. preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis prisma flow diagram.studies that examined gut microbiota with culture-based methods unclear in studies that applied 16s rrna sequencing techniques and low in studies that applied shotgun metagenome sequencing techniques.

disagreements in the categorization process were resolved after discussion between j. w. f. e. e. and c. k.we applied the grades of recommendation assessment development and evaluation working group grade approach to rate the quality of evi- dence qoe for each relevant outcome category.this approach specifies four levels of quality from high to very low which define the degree to which its estimates of effects or associations can be trusted.rcts started as high qoe and observational studies started as low qoe.several factors could either downgrade or upgrade the quality rating.resultsoverview of included studiesfrom 3380 identified studies we reviewed 137 potentially eligible full-text articles.
