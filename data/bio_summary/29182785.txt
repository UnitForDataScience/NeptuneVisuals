We graded the QoE as very low for the outcomes relating to microbial composition after antibiotic treatment Figure a-d. We graded the QoE as moderate for the outcomes relating to antibiotic resistance devel- opment owing to inclusion of observational studies that either had large effect sizes yes versus no and broad versus narrow or a dose-response effect long versus short after antibiotic treatment Figure a-c.Gut microbiota compositionNineteen studies reported on antibiotic exposure and impact on the gut microbiota composition Table  these comprised 2 RCTsand 17 observational studies.-Three studies reported outcome data from both antibiotic treatment yes versus no and broad versus narrow spectrumand one study reported outcome after antibiotic treatment yes versus no and long versus short.The remaining 15 studies reported outcome571Enterobacteriaceae 9 studies 1407 neonatesStudyAbundance andor colonization ratesSpecific outcomeAbundance or colonization rates LowerUnchangedHigherArboleya 2015EnterobacteriaceaeAbundanceBennet 1986  1987KlebsiellaEnterobacter spp.Colonization ratesBlakey 1982EnterobacteriaceaeColonization ratesBonnemaison 2003EnterobacteriaceaeColonization ratesFouhy 2012EnterobacteriaceaeColonization ratesGreenwood 2014Enterobacter spp.Colonization ratesHall 1990ColiformsColonization ratesLa Rosa 2014GammaproteobacteriaAbundanceWe graded QoE as very low owing to inclusion of observational studies with very serious risks of bias.Commensal obligate anaerobes 5 studies 304 neonatesStudyLowerAbundance andor colonization ratesSpecific outcomeAbundance or colonization ratesBennet 1986  1987Bifidobacterium spp.Colonization ratesLactobacillus spp.Bacteroides spp.Blakey 1982Lactobacillus spp.Colonization ratesBacteroides spp.Fouhy 2012Bifidobacterium spp.Colonization ratesLactobacillus spp.Hall 1990Bifidobacterium sppColonization ratesLactobacillus spp.We graded QoE as very low owing to inclusion of observational studies with very serious risks of bias.Figure 2.

The remaining 23 studies assessed only one category of antibiotic therapy.Nine studies reported on both infections and colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteriawhereas 15 studies only reported on colonization-- and 7 studies only reported on infections.MDR bacteria were varyingly defined as bacteria that were resistant to both third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosidesor bacteria resistant to 22 or 23 unrelated classes of antibiotics.-573Antibiotic exposure - compared with no antibiotic exposure 9 studies 2509 neonatesStudyInfection andor colonization ratesRisk estimatesSpecific outcomesColonizationLowerUnchangedHigheror infectionCrivaro 2007Not availableESBL-producing S. marcescens ColonizationDuman 2005RR 14.05 95 CI 1.19-164.62ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae ColonizationKumar 2014OR 26.04 95 CI 3.51-35.45Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii InfectionMillar 2008Not availableMDR EnterobacteriaceaeColonizationRettedal 2013OR 5.5 95 CI 5.6-15.3ESBL-producing K. pneumoniaeColonizationSehgal 2007OR 17.80 95 CI 1.91-165.54 ESBL-producing Gram-negativeInfectionWe graded QoE as moderate owing to inclusion of observational studies with large effect estimates.Antibiotic exposure - long duration compared with shorter duration 5 studies 4281 neonatesStudyInfection andor colonization ratesRisk estimatesSpecific outcomesColonizationLowerUnchangedHigheror infectionCrivaro 2007OR 1.32 95 CI 1.02-1.70ESBL-producing S. marcescens ColonizationWe graded QoE as moderate owing to inclusion of observational studies that demonstrated a dose-response effect.

Forty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria 3 RCTs published between 2000 and 2013and 45 observationalstudies published between 1974 and 2016 Figure .--Two articles presented data from the same study population and were defined as one study.Antibiotic treatment was the randomized intervention in two out of the three included RCTs.Among the 45 observational studies there were 22 prospective cohort studies 12 case-control studies 7 before-after studies and 4 retrospective cohort studies.

Five studies focused on different commensal obligate anaerobes showing a clear trend towards reduced colonization rates following treatment Figure b.In the five studies focusing on clostridia there were equivocal results Figure c.Finally four studies focused on Gram-positive cocci and these studies showed either unchanged or higher colonization rates after antibiotic treat- ment Figure d.Two studies n  983 reported Enterobacteriaceae coloniza- tion rates after treatment with broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotics.Both studies found lower colonization rates follow- ing third-generation cephalosporin treatment.

ContinuedMicrobial diversityFour studies 159 neonates compared microbial diversity after antibiotic treatment yes versus no.Two studies 112 preterm neonates reported decreased diversity among anti- biotic-treated neonates and two studies 47 neonates reported no significant differences.Three studies 224 preterm neonates examined the impact of antibiotic therapy duration long versus short on microbial diversity and all three found decreased diversity following prolonged therapy.Microbial compositionFigure displays the results of studies reporting the impact of anti- biotic treatment yes versus no on microbial composition.

It is possible that neonatal antibiotic therapy regardless of treatment length leads to decreased microbial diversity but the studies included in this category were small and two out of four studies did not detect a significant difference.575Second four out of nine studies reported increased abundance andor colonization rates of Enterobacteriaceae following neona- tal antibiotic treatment whereas none of the studies reported reduced abundance.In the majority of these studies the empirical regimens consisted of ampicillin and genta- micin.

Five studies reported data after long versus shorter duration of treatment and the majority found significantly more MDR Gram-negative bacteria after prolonged treatment Figure b. Thirteen studies reported data after treatment with broad- spectrum versus narrow-spectrum antibiotics and the over- whelming majority reported higher rates of MDR Gram-negativebacteria following treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics Figure c.-574Antibiotic exposure - broad spectrum compared with narrow spectrum 13 studies 4016 neonatesor infectionWe graded QoE as moderate owing to inclusion of observational studies with large effect estimates.Figure 3.

We excluded case reports and case series studies with a non-neonatal or non-human popula- tion studies that were written in languages other than English and studies that investigated antenatal antibiotics oral antibiotics andor low-dose intravenous vancomycin prophylaxis.Screening data extraction and managementTwo reviewers J. W. F. and E. E. independently screened search results and assessed each potentially eligible study per our predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

One study n  584 found a higher rate of prior antibiotic treatment in neo- nates colonized with antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli andor Klebsiella pneumoniae.One study n  953 found an increased incidence of TEM-1 genes in E. coli strains in neonates following antibiotic therapy.Two studies n  288 found no statistically significant associations between antibiotic treatment yes versus no and subsequent antibiotic resistance development.Two studies compared the impact of antibiotic therapy duration one of them n  1180 found significantly longer prior antibiotic treatment among neonates colonized with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteriawhereas the other unknown number of neonates found no correlation between the duration of treat- ment and gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.Eight studies n  3029 compared the impact of broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic treatment.One RCT n  276 found higher colonization rates with ampicillin-resistantA.
