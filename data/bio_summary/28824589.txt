the mock sample sequence data generated from different runs was analyzed in the metaamp pipeline separatelyto create otu taxonomic profiles alpha-diversity and beta- diversity indexes and hypothesis testing results with the parameters according to table 2.to infer the source of the non-mock community sequences in the mock samples mock samples and all the other samples from the same and previous miseq runs were also analyzed in metaamp.table 2  metaamp parameter configuration for mock community analysis.command optionscorresponding web interface optionsvalues-ananalysis namebenchmark-emailemail address-seqformatsequence formatdefault-seqtypesequencing typedefault-mapupload mapping filemapping.txt-oligosforward amplicon primers  reverse amplicon primersoligos.txt-gmarker gene typedefault-ssimilarity cutoffdefault-minoverlenminimum length of overlap100-maxdiffsmaximum number of mismatches in the overlap region-pdiffsmaximum number of differences to the primer sequence-maxeemaximum number of expected errors8default default-trunclentrim amplicon to a fixed lengthdefaultmetaamp parameter configuration details are available at  .mapping.txt file table s1 has five space separated columns sample name treatment strand read1 and read2 with the header line starting with .

the combined metaamp analysis of the mock community samples and the other samples sequenced in the same run as well as in the previous run of the miseq sequencer showed that six of the unexpected otus from mockrun2 and one from mockrun1 were highly abundant in other samples sequenced in the same or the previous miseq run.

in the case of metaamp taxonomic classification is based on the classify.seqs command in mothur which can as we have shown in this study produce inaccurate taxonomic assignments when the targeted taxonomy is missing from the reference templates.one challenge for all amplicon sequencing studies which can be at least partially addressed with metaamp is the problem of cross-talk within and between sequencing runs.

2006. this approach consists of 1 extraction of dna from a set of samples 2 amplification of the 400 bp target region using the polymerase chain reaction pcr with a primer pair that targets conserved sequence elements on both sides of the amplified region 3 barcoding of the amplicons of each sample with a short barcode sequence unique to each sample and 4 high throughput multiplexed sequencing of the combined amplicons from all samples in a single sequencing run.

this problem resulting from sequencing andor image analysis errors during the index sequencing phase of the miseq run a separate step in the sequencing process causes a small fraction of amplicons from one library to be incorrectly assigned to an index of another library nelson et al.

since its launch 2 years ago metaamp has been used2800 times by many users worldwide.keywords metagenomics amplicon sequencing bioinformatics microbial ecology microbiomeintroductionmicrobial communities are made up of many populations and it has long been known that a meaningful assessment of microbial community structure is almost impossible with classical cloning and sanger sequencing approaches curtis et al.

2015.typical computational steps needed for data analysis consist of filtering out those sequencing reads that have a poor quality trimming off sequencing adapters and barcodes merging of each set of paired-end reads into a single sequence based on overlap and assignment of sequences to samples using the barcodes.

this platform typically yields25 million 2 x 300 bp paired-end reads per run which enables parallel sequencing of up to 400 samples at 50000 paired end reads per sample.the consumable costs of this approach can be less than 50 per sample and an experienced scientist can process hundreds of samples per week depending on the degree of automation available.

at the same time all biological and technical replicates of each type of the mock community were consistent.based on bray-curtis and thetayc dissimilarity matrixes metaamp generated dendrograms to describe the similarity of the samples to each other.

here we present the metaamp pipeline for processing of ssu rrna gene and other non-coding or protein-coding amplicon sequencing data by investigators that are inexperienced with bioinformatics procedures.

their proper use requires significant expertise and training.for this reason we developed metaamp for simple fast command-line and web-based push-of-a-button processing of amplicon sequencing data for casual users.

2014.in conclusion we presented and validated metaamp a push- of-a-button pipeline for entry level users of amplicon sequencing.
