We call for regional probiotic innovation via strong collaboration among industry academi- cianscientists and regulators.Future actions for probiotic development in Southeast Asia particularly Indonesia includeStrengthening ABG academician business govern- ment partnership to develop probiotic product innova- tion in IndonesiaDeveloping methods in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the functionality and safety of probioticsFollowing the guidelines provided by FAOWHO as a prerequisite for development of probiotic strainsFollowing the regulatory framework for specific health claims on probiotic food labels in cases where scien- tific evidence existsApplying good manufacturing practices GMP in the production of probiotic foods with quality assurance and shelf-life conditions establishedSetting up trial guidelines for GLP good laboratory practice GCP good clinical practice and GMP when developing probiotics for therapeutic use and health claims.Conclusions and recommendationsProbiotics have received extensive attention from pub- lic business and research communities due to poten- tial health benefits.Indonesia's National Agency for Drug and Food Con- trol NADFC Badan POM oversees the safety quali- ty efficacy and label of the probiotic products market- ed in Indonesia.Probiotic foods marketed in Indonesia are mostly manufactured in Indonesia but they are produced un- der international licensed probiotic strains and tech- nology from the mother company.Academician business and government ABG should strengthen interactive communication for the development of probiotics in Indonesia.Growing public interest in probiotics calls for appro- priate regulatory and policy action.

According to FAOWHO prerequisites of a probiotic areA probiotic must be alive when administered.A probiotic must have undergone controlled evaluation to document health benefits in the target host.A probiotic must be a taxonomically defined microbe or combination of microbes genus species and strainlevel.A probiotic must be safe for its intended use.Liquid milk sales in Indonesia including probiotics grew by 18 in 2010.

In terms of health indices microbial composition correlated with fragility as less diverse microbiota profiles were found in those who were more fragile had poorer nutri- tion which also tied in with dental health care because if dental health is a problem food choice is going to differ and detectable markers of inflammation.We analysed the microbiota in terms of the type of bac- teria that are present.

How much do genetic factors vis-a-vis diet contribute to gut microbiota composition among Asians These questions pose opportunities for future work in Phase 2 of the Asian Microbiota Program.Changes in intestinal microbiota through the human life cycleIntestinal microbiota during life - Patricia Conway University of New South Wales AustraliaThe intestinal microbiota is continually evolving in terms of composition and function during life from birth when the gut has extremely low numbers to the 100s of trillions of microbes in the adult.

The results indicated there was a remarkably higher augmentation of total salivary sIgA level of children in probiotic group compared with placebo group.Based on their bodyweight there was a significant ele- vation of total salivary sIgA of underweight children in probiotic group higher than the placebo group after 90 days E. faecium IS-27526 108cfuday supplementation.E.

The government would like to prac- tice caution in marketing probiotics in different popula- tions which is why probiotics are not allowed to be mar- keted with any claims unless they are proven in the local population.Comment I would like to ask the expert group - is it necessary to test the effectiveness of probiotic in every local population because this will be a real challenge for industry specifically to take every probiotic that you wish to have that you need to test in every individual country.

The following papers describe the intestinal ecosystem in Asian popula- tions changes in intestinal microbial composition through the human life cycle and its effects the Asian gut micro- biota in disease conditions indigenous probiotics to maintain a healthy gut microbiome and significant en- hancement of humoral immune response and probiotic regulation in an Asian country.

The 79 subject volunteers meeting the inclusive criteria were randomly assigned in consecutive way.Gut microbiome Asia965Among the placebo group n40 there were 23 girls and 17 boys who received 1 mg maltodextrin in 125 mL commercial UHT low fat milk and in the probiotic group n39 there were 17 girls and 22 boys administrated with 1 mg lyophilized E. faecium IS-27526 2.31x108cfuday in 125 mL commercial UHT low fat milk every day for a period of 90 days.
