according to faowho prerequisites of a probiotic area probiotic must be alive when administered.a probiotic must have undergone controlled evaluation to document health benefits in the target host.a probiotic must be a taxonomically defined microbe or combination of microbes genus species and strainlevel.a probiotic must be safe for its intended use.liquid milk sales in indonesia including probiotics grew by 18 in 2010. data on registered lactic acid bacteria lab-based foods and probiotic foods in in- donesia show that 1 lab-based foods are dominated by yogurt and only approximately 10 consist of pro- biotic food 2 probiotic foods are dominated by growing up milks and 3 probiotic food products produced in indonesia are not necessarily by national companies.

in terms of health indices microbial composition correlated with fragility as less diverse microbiota profiles were found in those who were more fragile had poorer nutri- tion which also tied in with dental health care because if dental health is a problem food choice is going to differ and detectable markers of inflammation.we analysed the microbiota in terms of the type of bac- teria that are present.

how much do genetic factors vis-a-vis diet contribute to gut microbiota composition among asians these questions pose opportunities for future work in phase 2 of the asian microbiota program.changes in intestinal microbiota through the human life cycleintestinal microbiota during life - patricia conway university of new south wales australiathe intestinal microbiota is continually evolving in terms of composition and function during life from birth when the gut has extremely low numbers to the 100s of trillions of microbes in the adult.

probiotics may improve nutrient absorption and enhance humoral intestinal immune response.indigenous probiotics such as lactobacillus plantarum is-10506 and enterococcus faecium is-27526 have been exposed to surrounding microbes and are more suitable for indonesian people.the recommended effective dose for e. faecium is- 27526 and l. plantarum is-10506 at which no adverse effect is observed is 108 and 1010cfuday respectively.regulatory challenges in the development of foods for gut health indonesia - yusra egayanti national agency for drug and food control republic of indone- siai would like to share with you our experience in develop- ing standards for probiotics and assessing probiotics in indonesia.

global concerns including those of indone- sia regarding use of probiotics are that 1 government regulations regarding safety assessment differ among countries and the status of probiotics as a component in food is currently not established on an international basis and 2 there is a need to record and analyse ad- verse events associated with probiotics in food and monitor long-term health benefits.indonesian regulations on probiotics aim to provide consumer protection and ensure fair and responsible trade.

the government would like to prac- tice caution in marketing probiotics in different popula- tions which is why probiotics are not allowed to be mar- keted with any claims unless they are proven in the local population.comment i would like to ask the expert group - is it necessary to test the effectiveness of probiotic in every local population because this will be a real challenge for industry specifically to take every probiotic that you wish to have that you need to test in every individual country.
