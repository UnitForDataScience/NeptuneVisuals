Such slowly metabolizing organisms in- clude the methanogens which have been shown to be increased in IBS-C patients.20-23 Early experimental animal studies suggest thatdirect infusion of methane into the small intestine slowed small intestinal transit but how that translates to an intact patient re- mains unclear.24 Furthermore as the organisms grow slowly and are sensitive to increased transit time their role in constipation might be secondary rather than causative.25 Breath methane has been shown to correlate with intestinal transit time in functional con- stipation but the presence or absence of methane production does not seem to alter responsiveness to treatment with ispaghula.26 Interestingly a recent study by Parthasarathy and colleagues showed that the microbial profiles collected from colonic mucosa could discriminate constipated patients from healthy controls whereas the luminal ie fecal microbiota did not.27 They studied the effect of diet constipation status breath gases and colonic transit on the microbial composition collected from 25 constipated and 25 healthy patients' fecal samples and biopsies from sigmoid colon.

Abnormally high anxiety scores were found in 72 of 319 patients with IBS and 36 had depression scores above the normal range.41 While severe GI symptoms undoubtedly induce psychological distress previous studies have shown that prior anxiety increases the risk of developing IBS42 suggesting anxiety can be the primary cause in at least some patients.

A recent small mechanistic placebo-controlled trial in 44 IBS patients showed that Bifidobacterium longum a commonly used probiotic species re- duced depression as well limbic reactivity often targeted with antide- pressants.43 While striking given the variability in IBS patients a much larger study is needed to confirm this finding has clinical applications.8  DEALING WITH PATIENT HETEROGENEITY The heterogeneity of the patient material is clearly a drawback in un- derstanding the complex connections between the intestinal microbiota and IBS.

Several studies have now shown that the microbial pro- files of the patients can be subdivided into those that are very similar to the healthy controls and to those with a clearly dysbiotic microbiota.1844 This separation also has been shown in part to reflect the psychologi- cal component where the patient with a microbial composition similar to the healthy controls had more anxiety and depression whereas the patients with dysbiotic microbiota had increased immune response and altered host gene expression.

Controlling the many dietary and pathophysiological factors such as gut transit and psychological stress will be vital in the future as we attempt to manipulate the microbiota for therapeutic gain.CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No competing interests are declared.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS JJ and RS wrote the Mini-review together.REFERENCES Wolf PG Parthasarathy G Chen J et al.
