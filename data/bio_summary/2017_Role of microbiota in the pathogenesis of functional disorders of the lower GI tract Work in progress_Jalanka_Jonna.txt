such slowly metabolizing organisms in- clude the methanogens which have been shown to be increased in ibs-c patients.20-23 early experimental animal studies suggest thatdirect infusion of methane into the small intestine slowed small intestinal transit but how that translates to an intact patient re- mains unclear.24 furthermore as the organisms grow slowly and are sensitive to increased transit time their role in constipation might be secondary rather than causative.25 breath methane has been shown to correlate with intestinal transit time in functional con- stipation but the presence or absence of methane production does not seem to alter responsiveness to treatment with ispaghula.26 interestingly a recent study by parthasarathy and colleagues showed that the microbial profiles collected from colonic mucosa could discriminate constipated patients from healthy controls whereas the luminal ie fecal microbiota did not.27 they studied the effect of diet constipation status breath gases and colonic transit on the microbial composition collected from 25 constipated and 25 healthy patients' fecal samples and biopsies from sigmoid colon.

abnormally high anxiety scores were found in 72 of 319 patients with ibs and 36 had depression scores above the normal range.41 while severe gi symptoms undoubtedly induce psychological distress previous studies have shown that prior anxiety increases the risk of developing ibs42 suggesting anxiety can be the primary cause in at least some patients.

a recent small mechanistic placebo-controlled trial in 44 ibs patients showed that bifidobacterium longum a commonly used probiotic species re- duced depression as well limbic reactivity often targeted with antide- pressants.43 while striking given the variability in ibs patients a much larger study is needed to confirm this finding has clinical applications.8  dealing with patient heterogeneity the heterogeneity of the patient material is clearly a drawback in un- derstanding the complex connections between the intestinal microbiota and ibs.
