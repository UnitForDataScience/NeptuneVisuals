Obesity is becoming recognized as one of the most critical contributing risk factors for cardiovascular disease 2.In January of 2015 WHO updated some information about overweight and obesity including 1 the worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1980 and 2014 2 39 of adults aged 18 years and over 38 of men and 40 of women were overweight and about 13 of the world's adult population 11 of men and 15 of women were obese in 2014 3 42 mil- lion children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 20134 most of the world's population lives in countries where over- weight and obesity kills more people than underweight http The increased prevalence of obesity has become a worldwide health concern and the whole societies are burdened by those obesity-associated chronic disorders including cardiovascular disease and negative effects on quality of life.

In addition nonclinical and clinical studies in recent years have revealed that the gut mi- crobiota an environmental factor plays a critical role in the obesity progression and the associated chronic disorders 4-6.Here we describe and discuss the relationship between gut mi- crobiota and obesity development.

A reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes are also considered as a contributing factor for influencing metabolic pathways which are likely involved in obesity 40.Interestingly the gut microbiota phenotype of obesity can be transmissible simply by transplanting fecal microbiota from the obese donors into healthy lean ones.

Favoring the abundance of beneficial bacteria restricting the growth of pathogenic populations and reshaping the microbiota structure by herbs have potential positive effects on anti- obesity therapy.Animal StudiesSome studies indicate that obesity is closely linked with chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis which can lead to cardiovascular diseases insulin resistance type 2 diabetes and so on 42.

Quercetin treatment attenuated FB ratio and inhibited the growth of bacterial species associated to diet-induced obesity Erysipelotrichaceae Bacillus Eubacterium cylindroides and increased some speciesBacteroides vulgatus Akkermansia muciniphila that have been inversely related to obesity.

Although several lines of evidence support the concept that herbs can target the gut microbiota via different mechanisms as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity more studies are needed to elucidate the associations between the obesity and the vulnerable bacteria.

The increased prevalence of obesity casts a cloud over the global health and the whole societies and will still be burdened in the future.

Therefore prevention andA R T I C L E H I S T O R Ytherapy of obesity is a beneficial strategy for the prevention of chronic cardiovascular disease.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota takes part in human health and disease including obesity.
