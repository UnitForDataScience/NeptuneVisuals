In the present systematic review statisti- cally significantly higher concentrations of MMP-8 were reported in patients with periodontal disease compared with the control group as well as in patients presenting more advanced periodontal disease stages P  .005.The MMP-8 levels in healthy patients may be associated with the homeostasis of noninflammatory tissue caused by periodontal disease 31 and homeostatic protection of periodontal tissue.2041MMP-8 reflects not only the severity of the disease but also the therapeutic response because the levels of MMP-8 are higher in generalized periodontitis than in localized periodontitis.42 Therefore monitoring and regulating of MMP-8 through therapeutic procedures may be a key factor for periodontal disease control.Tobacco smoking is an important risk factor in the development and severity of periodontal disease.

In the study performed by Rai et al16 MMP-8 concentrations in SF were 95.2 ngmL in healthy pa- tients 312.8 ngmL in patients diagnosed with gingivitis data not shown and 428.6 ngmL in patients with periodontitis.When evaluating patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis Gupta et al20 observed higher MMP-8 levels in SF of patients present- ing chronic periodontal disease 348.26 ngmL when compared with subjects in the control group 190.91 ngmL.In the study conducted by Gursoy et al17 using the ELISA tech- nique MMP-8 concentrations in SF were 1001.0 pgmL in the studyTABLE 2 Results of systematic literature reviewRai et al16 2008CrevicularSalivary428.6 ngmL -332.495.2 -70.2Salivary MMP-8 may serve as a biomarker forperiodontal disease and aid in early detection of periodontitis or gingivitis.Gursoy et al17 2010Yakob et al18 2012Salivary1001.0 pgmL -717.7451.0 pgmL-420.4Crevicular240.24 ngmL -146.83234.80 ngmL-169.71Salivary MMP-8 is a potential candidate in the detection of advanced periodontitis.

As a result MMP-8 has been identified as a possible biomarker in providing a periodontal disease diagnosis.5  CONCLUSION The present systematic review found significantly higher MMP-8 concentrations in patients with periodontal disease compared with controls as well as in patients presenting more advanced stages of periodontal disease.

In 2013 Gursoy et al19 using the immunofluorometric assay IFMA technique divided the groups analyzed according to probing depth and verified a progressive increase in the expression of MMP-8 according to probing depth in patients with periodontal disease noting a concentration of 318.5 ng mL of MMP-8 in the control group while the group diagnosed with generalized periodontitis exhibited a concentration of MMP-8 of770.8 ngmL.3.6  Synthesis of the results from theevaluated literatureIn the study conducted by Rai et al16 high levels of MMP-8 were significantly correlated P  .001 to patients diagnosed with gingivi- tis and periodontitis as well as statistically correlated to the clinical parameters of probing depth loss of clinical insertion bleeding when probed and the highest age range of the patients P  .001.A study conducted by Gupta et al20 evaluated MMP-8 levels in pa- tients diagnosed with periodontal disease and controls.

At the end of the analyses six articles published between 2008 and 2016 met all the inclusion criteria and were included in the present systematicTABLE 1 Summary of the descriptive characteristics of the included studies n  6Rai et al16 2008India53NI35.1 -8.738151820Selection criteria of patients with gingivitis presence ofgeneralized gingival inflammation with bleeding on probing.Selection criteria of patients with periodontitis 18 teeth excluding third molars of which at least 12 had to be posterior teeth presence of moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontitis at least 7 teeth with periodontal pockets deeper than 6 mm.ELISAGursoy et al17 2010Finland165NI48.6 -5.3848108414 teeth with a probing pocket depth of 4 mm theperiodontitis group and 81 samples from subjects with no teeth with probing pocket depth of 4 mm the control group.IFMA ELISAYakob et al18 2012Finland9946 53 59.2 -2.95643043Bleeding on probing periodontal disease and clinicalattachment loss were assessed on four surfaces using aIFMA ELISA female  male IFMA immunofluorometric assay NI not informed.Heikkinen et al36 were the first authors to perform PoC-aMMP-8 revealing successful differentiation between tissue samples of healthy periodontium and periodontal disease.

Study characteristicsAmong the selected studies four were conducted in developed coun- tries 17-1921 and two in India a developing country.1620 The authors evaluated MMP-8 in patients diagnosed with periodontal disease and in control patients Table 1.Regarding the design and methodological characteristics patient samples varied between 4020 and 23019 with a median of 76 partici- pants and a total sample size of 630 patients Tables 1 and 2.

Significantly higher P  .005 levels of MMP-8 were found in patients with peri- odontal disease compared with control patients as well as significant relationships between MMP-8 and all clinical parameters analyzed namely probing pocket depth clinical attachment loss gingival index and plaque index P  .005.Gursoy et al17 evaluated MMP-8 in SF from patients with com- promised periodontal tissues and controls.

Thus changes in the homeostasis between MMPs and TIMPs are involved in periodontal tissue degradation and in different stages of periodontal disease.5-7MMP-8 has been reported to be associated with severity of peri- odontal disease being present at high levels in gingival crevicular fluid and salivary fluid SF.8-10 During periodontal disease MMP-8 is se- creted by several types of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages and high MMP-8 concentrations are associated with tissue destruction.11 Expression of MMP-8 has also been studied in the gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis .1213 Regarding non- smokers it has been found that subjects with untreated chronic peri- odontitis expressed higher levels of MMP-8 in the gingival tissues than did subjects with a healthy and intact periodontium.13156  c 2017 John Wiley  Sons AS.

Comparison of SF and gingival crevicular fluid collection methodolo- gies revealed that collection of SF is simpler because gingival crevic- ular fluid material takes longer to collect and only a small sample is obtained which is frequently contaminated with blood andor dental calculus from the filter paper.2030 The disadvantage of SF analysis is the inability to detect with any accuracy the sites of periodontal disease activity.1730 However when Rai et al16 and Yakob et al18 an- alyzed gingival crevicular fluid only the study by Rai et al16 reported a statistically significant difference between the control group and the study group regarding MMP-8 levels in gingival crevicular fluid P  .005 whereas all studies evaluating MMP-8 in SF showed astatistically significant difference in the concentration of this bio- marker in patients with periodontal disease compared with controls indicating greater sensitivity of SF overall for detecting changes in MMP-8.161719-21The most suitable method for analysis investigated in this sys- tematic review was the ELISA technique however other methods may have greater specificity for detecting MMP-8.
