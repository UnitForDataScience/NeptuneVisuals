Vaginally delivered infants have a gut microbiota that resembles the microbiota of the maternal vagina whereas infants born via a Caesarean section C-section have a gut microbiota that resembles skin microbiota -.Second breastfeeding versus formula feeding has an impact on microbiota composition.

In recent years it has been further suggested that aber- rancies in the infant intestinal microbiota affect gut motor function and gas production thereby leading to excessive crying.Available treatments for infant colic range from drug thera- pies and nutritional interventions to behavioral interventions however there is no standard care .Gut microbiota and colicSeveral studies were performed to investigate the differ- ences in gut microbiota between healthy infants and infants with colic.

Some important factors in children include withholding behavior of stools psychosocial factors behavioral disorders parental child-rearing attitudes low fiber intake and the gut microbiota composition .Gut microbiota and FCIn the last decades only a few studies reported on microbiota in children with constipation.

Failure to transfer fiber and prebiotic fermenting microbes from mother to offspring is considered a potential issue for long-term health over the generations .Finally other factors that can influence the composition of the microbiota such as the use of pre- and postnatal antibiotics premature birth geographic influences host genetics diet stress and hygiene are reviewed elsewhere -.Adjusting the diet by adding for example dietary fibers or prebiotics gives the opportunity to modulate the gut micro- biota and exert effects on health.Dietary fiber and prebioticsThe role of dietary fiber was already discussed by Hippocrates in the medical literature in the fourth century BC.

The microbiota of formula-fed babies contains more diverse species resembling an adult-like microbiota and this is influenced by the presence or not of prebiotics in the for- mula milk .Third the weaning period where the child receives a variety of solid foods modifies the gut microbiota.

Moreover there is evidence that the gut microbiota can affect health in the long run.However it remains a challenge to determine whether there is a causal link between the gut microbiota and the disease state for many diseases.

A better understanding of the gut microbiota in healthy children and children with a disease is essential in order to improve our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in disease development.

Even though there is no universal defini- tion for dietary fiber all definitions hold that 'Dietary fiber is a group of carbohydrate polymers oligomers and lignin that escape digestion in the small intestine and reach the colon intact where they are partially or completely fermented by the gut microbiota' .
