Both Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria MAGs contained genes for the degradation of branched chain amino acids leucine isoleucine valine that were not present in the five Roseofilum MAGs and the Roseofilum MAGs had more genes associated with the degradation of urea than Bacteroidetesand Proteobacteria MAGs Table S4.

Clustering of Roseofilum MAGs based on the relative abundance of proteins showed a clear geographic signal with Caribbean MAGs clustering together and Pacific MAGs from three different research groups clustering together Figure 2.

The Roseofilum MAGs contained the highest number of biosynthetic clusters followed by Bacteroidetes MAGs and the fewest clusters were detected in Proteobacteria MAGs.

The presence of sulfidequinone oxidoreductase genes in all five Roseofilum MAGs and in the MAGs of several heterotrophs demonstrates that resistance to sulfide is an important characteristic for members of the BBD consortium.Keywords coral microbiology coral disease cyanobacteria microbiome Roseofilum reptotaeniumINTRODUCTIONBlack Band Disease BBD is a globally distributed coral disease that devastates dozens of species of corals including large reef-building scleractinians Sato et al.

A second pan- genome analysis of the five Roseofilum MAGs described here along with the recently published MAGs of Roseofilum from the Great Barrier Reef Sato et al.

With the exception of the LKpool Roseofilum which was assembled from pooled coral hosts the MAGs of Roseofilum were relatively complete and contained low redundancy 4 or less of the single- copy genes in the Roseofilum MAGs were present in morethan one copy.

The two-way average nucleotide identity of the four Caribbean Roseofilum MAGs was 99 similarity while the Guam Roseofilum MAG showed around 94 similarity to the Caribbean Roseofilum MAGs.

In addition to the five Roseofilum MAGs MAGs of 12Bacteroidetes and 9 Proteobacteria were recovered by binning including an unclassified gammaproteobacterium Bacteroidales and Desulfovibrio which have been detected as common in BBD consortia through 16S amplicon surveys Figure 1 Miller and Richardson 2011 Meyer et al.

2016.Functional Characteristics of Black Band Disease Metagenomes andMetagenome-Assembled GenomesThe five Roseofilum MAGs had similar functional profiles based on KEGG Ontology Figure S2 as well as similar gene synteny Figure S3 in contrast to the more taxonomically and functionally diverse Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria MAGs Figure S2.

Of these differentially represented functions 13 had an effect size 0.6 meaning that the difference in the mean relative abundance was 60 and encompassed mostly functions that were present solely in the Roseofilum MAGs and not in the MAGs of heterotrophs Figure 3.
