47 Sequencing provided evidence of lung microbiome enrichment with gut-associated bacteria in both mice suffering of experimental sepsis and human patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome but not healthy controls.Gut-brain axisRecent research has shown extensive crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the brain that is through neuropeptides or endocrine immune and nerve signaling  which have resulted in the suggestion that the gut microbiome might play a role in cognitive function and behavior .

It was shown that therapy with the SCFA's acetate propionate and butyrate was protective in an ischemiareperfusion model of AKI injury 56Interestingly another study using a similar model showed that gut microbiome depletion before induction resulted in protection against renal dysfunction damage and inflam- mation  suggestive of a deleterious effect of 'normal' gut microbiome during AKI.For an overview of the proposed role of various gut microbiome states in immune priming and susceptibility to secondary infections see Fig.

However a follow- up intervention trial in which healthy human study participants were pretreated with antibiotics prior to the administration of lipopolysaccharide intrave- nously showed that gut microbiota disruption by broad-spectrum antibiotics does not affect systemic innate immune responses during human endotox- emia 37These novel insights on the role of the microbiome in systemic immunity are increasingly being used in disease research resulting in the development of theories of gut microbiome to organ interactions popularly coined gut-organ axes.Gut-lung axisThe gut-lung axis refers to the crosstalk that is hypothesized to take place between the gut micro- biota and the lungs which might be important in diseases ranging from allergic asthma to lung infec- tion reviewed 38Evidence that the gut and the lung were closer connected than was initially thought emerged over 20 years ago from studies in rat models of trauma and hemorrhagic shock THS .

Despite the heterogeneity of disease states among critically ill patients it has become apparent that ICU treatment is associated with an extreme and long-lasting shift in microbiome compositionwith potentially negative impact on both short and long-term outcome 4 Unfortunately clinical research assessing therapeutic modalities that could strengthen the microbiome of patients on the ICU are sparse.

Furthermore it will be of particular interest to learn which gut microbiome species and metabolites account for the hypothes- ized effects on host health.What can be stated is that in a healthy situation at least two factors appear to be present that is a diverse symbiotic gut microbiome and an intact intestinal barrier.

Schematic overview of the microbiome gradient between homeostasis in healthy people and dysbiosis in critical ill.could potentially enhance host defense in critically ill patients.FUNCTION OF THE GUT MICROBIOME BASICSThe intestinal microbiota are hard to cultivate and study in the laboratory so far up to 77 of the bacteria in the gut have been cultivated How- ever the fast development of novel molecular tech- niques in the last few decades has considerably increased our insights into this complex ecosystem .

When compared to healthy controls the gut microbiome of patients with sepsis is characterized by lower diversity lower abundances of key commensal genera such as258Volume 23  Number 4  August 2017Gut microbiota and host defense in critical illness Jacobs et al.Faecalibacterium Blautia Ruminococcus and some- times overgrowth over 50 relative abundance by one genera like Clostridium difficile Staphylococcus spp.

Besides SCFA pathogen-associated molecular patterns and bacteria themselves are believed to be translocated into the lamina propria and260Volume 23  Number 4  August 2017Gut microbiota and host defense in critical illness Jacobs et al.Conversely a protective role of the gut microbiome along the gut-lung axis was suggested in several murine models of bacterial pneumonia and sepsis.

In this condition commensal bacteria may translocate in systemic circulation turn pathogenic and cause secondary infections.1070-5295 Copyright c 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health Inc.

Nat Microbiol 2016 116113.The study reports evidence that the lung microbiome is enriched with intestinal microbiota both in a murine model of sepsis and in humans with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
