47 sequencing provided evidence of lung microbiome enrichment with gut-associated bacteria in both mice suffering of experimental sepsis and human patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome but not healthy controls.gut-brain axisrecent research has shown extensive crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the brain that is through neuropeptides or endocrine immune and nerve signaling  which have resulted in the suggestion that the gut microbiome might play a role in cognitive function and behavior .

it was shown that therapy with the scfa's acetate propionate and butyrate was protective in an ischemiareperfusion model of aki injury 56interestingly another study using a similar model showed that gut microbiome depletion before induction resulted in protection against renal dysfunction damage and inflam- mation  suggestive of a deleterious effect of 'normal' gut microbiome during aki.for an overview of the proposed role of various gut microbiome states in immune priming and susceptibility to secondary infections see fig.

despite the heterogeneity of disease states among critically ill patients it has become apparent that icu treatment is associated with an extreme and long-lasting shift in microbiome compositionwith potentially negative impact on both short and long-term outcome 4 unfortunately clinical research assessing therapeutic modalities that could strengthen the microbiome of patients on the icu are sparse.

4151614the occurrence of the last feature - overgrowth by a single bacterial species - is only observed in roughly a third of cases but does seem to increase with the time a patient stays on the icu 14. explanations for gut micro- biome dysbiosis in critically ill patients include but are not limited to the use of parenteral feeding gastric acid inhibitory drugs and antibiotics 18 additionally mechanical ventilation was recently shown to be an influencer of microbiome dynamics and most probably as a result the susceptibility to nosocomial infection 19distant effect of the gut microbiome during critical illness the concept of the gut-organ axescurrently it is hypothesized that microbiota- derived components such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns and metabolites that derive from the gut can reach the circulatory system and interact at the systemic level to influence immune homeo- stasis murine models exerting manipulated gut microbiomes through breeding in sterile environ- ments i.e.

however a follow- up intervention trial in which healthy human study participants were pretreated with antibiotics prior to the administration of lipopolysaccharide intrave- nously showed that gut microbiota disruption by broad-spectrum antibiotics does not affect systemic innate immune responses during human endotox- emia 37these novel insights on the role of the microbiome in systemic immunity are increasingly being used in disease research resulting in the development of theories of gut microbiome to organ interactions popularly coined gut-organ axes.gut-lung axisthe gut-lung axis refers to the crosstalk that is hypothesized to take place between the gut micro- biota and the lungs which might be important in diseases ranging from allergic asthma to lung infec- tion reviewed 38evidence that the gut and the lung were closer connected than was initially thought emerged over 20 years ago from studies in rat models of trauma and hemorrhagic shock ths .

furthermore it will be of particular interest to learn which gut microbiome species and metabolites account for the hypothes- ized effects on host health.what can be stated is that in a healthy situation at least two factors appear to be present that is a diverse symbiotic gut microbiome and an intact intestinal barrier.

these microbes as we have learned in recent times con- tribute to various physiological processes that are crucial for human homeostasis and health these observations have guided the current paradigm that the gut microbiome could in fact be perceived as the latest discovered human organ.

this is probably in part explained be a clear lack of mechanistic insights on how a healthy and stable microbiome confers protection against opportunistic pathogens as well as organ damage.

the optimal composition of a healthy microbiome is under debate  however general features havebeen noted.

the above-mentioned features need to be in balance and when this balance shifts we speak of a disturbed homeostasis or dysbiosis.of special interest is the relationship of the gut microbiome in the host defense against specific pathogens the role of which we are only just begin- ning to uncover.

elimination of these commensal bacteria by external factors for example antibiotics is therefore hypothesized to lead to overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens .the gut microbiome dynamics in critically ill patientscritically ill patients admitted to the icu have severely altered and unstable microbiomes 414151617 however so far the number and types e.g.

septic nonseptic location of sepsis of icu patients in clinical studies that investigated the microbiome have been limited.

when compared to healthy controls the gut microbiome of patients with sepsis is characterized by lower diversity lower abundances of key commensal genera such as258volume 23  number 4  august 2017gut microbiota and host defense in critical illness jacobs et al.faecalibacterium blautia ruminococcus and some- times overgrowth over 50 relative abundance by one genera like clostridium difficile staphylococcus spp.

diet is key in shaping the ecosystem of the gut microbiome and important in host metabolism 2829 fiber-rich diets have demonstrated positive effects in intesti- nal barrier integrity amelioration of intestinal inflammatory disease and even protection against invading pathogens and sepsis in preclinical models .
