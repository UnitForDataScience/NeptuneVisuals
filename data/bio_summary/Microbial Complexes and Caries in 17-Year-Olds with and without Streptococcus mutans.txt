Specifically a few species were enumerated in subjects with S. mutans whereas those who were not colonized by S. mutans were characterized by a panel of significantly associated taxa data not shown.Subsequently species in tooth biofilm that were associated with increasing levels of present caries higher DeS scores in adolescents without detectable S. mutans by Illumina MiSeq or PCR were searched for with PLS regression.

However targeting the v3-v4 region may have underestimated species in the Firmicutes phylum such as Streptococcus and Lactobacillus.Conclusions based on the present findings are as follows 1 subjects with high numbers of S. mutans were characterized by few associated taxa a result consistent with the ecologic con- cept of caries 2 the combination of lacking S. mutans and having caries was associated with a panel of acidogenic and aciduricacidophilic species including Scardovia wiggsiae and 3 distinct tooth microbiota clusters were associated with caries prevalence.

S. mutans was the only species that was significantly P  0.005 more abundant in saliva and tooth biofilm samples from subjects with caries DeS 1 than those from caries-free DeS  0 adolescents although numeric increases in several other species were observed in the former samples relative to the latter samples.

The objectives of the present study were 1 to characterize the tooth biofilm and saliva microbiota of adolescents with caries disease with or without detectable S. mutans from tooth biofilm and saliva samples and 2 to assess taxa clustering in the tooth biofilm and saliva samples and relate this information to caries status.

2016.The aims of the present study were 1 to characterize the tooth biofilm and saliva microbiota of caries-diseased adoles- cents with or without detectable S. mutans from tooth biofilm and saliva samples and 2 to assess taxa clustering in the tooth biofilm and saliva samples and relate the results to caries prev- alence.

Species richness as indicated by rarefaction curves for tooth biofilm and saliva was identical for those with and without S. mutans in tooth biofilm and saliva B.Global Sequencing ResultsAfter quality filtering 9744159 reads with a mean read length of 426 bp were retained for saliva samples and 4829569 readswith an average read length of 424 bp were retained for tooth biofilm samples.

In subjects with caries experience high levels of S. mutans were associated with a few species and low levels with a panel of saccharolytic species.

In the same group undetectable or extremely low levels of S. mutans were associ- ated with a panel of species n  29 including 2 species in the Actinomyces Dialister Fusobacterium Neisseria Pepto- streptococcaceae 11G-7 Tannerella and Treponema gen- era Fig.
