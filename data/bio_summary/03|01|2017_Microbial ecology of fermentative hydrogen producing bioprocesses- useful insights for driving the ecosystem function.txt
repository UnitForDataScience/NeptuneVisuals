however its h2 production effi- ciency depends on the species and substrate considered as evidenced for a. fermentans low hydrogen production from glutamate fermentation rogosa  while the fermen- tation of citrate leads to significant hydrogen production cook et al.

however hydrogen production through syntrophic reactions is not expected and desired in h2 production bioreactors due to the strict metabolic requirements of syntrophic bacteria imply- ing that h2 concentration must remain extremely low.engineered ecosystems for h2 production far from pure culturesall the findings discussed above clearly illustrate that even though known efficient hpb are present in the community the h2 production efficiency will also depend on the composition of the whole community including h2 consumers and competi- tors or inhibitors which counteract the hpb activity.

.synergism between diverse hydrogen producerswhile the previous sections aimed at describing the main hpb individually it is important to note that in practice many exam- ples of natural coexistence of diverse hpb including strict and facultative anaerobes have been reported in bioreactors usually beneficial to hydrogen production.in glucose-fed cstr some strains of enterobacteriaceae con- tributed to hydrogen production as non-dominant hpb in asso- ciation with dominant clostridium and were resistant to envi- ronmental conditions they maintained at the same abundance independently of the ph and the fermentation type ethanol vs butyrate imposed by the different clostridium species song et al.

thus there is currently no generally accepted selection criterion for the most favorable fermentative hydrogen production route in mixed cultures which is one of the main limitations of the fer- mentative hydrogen production process kleerebezem and van loosdrecht .

.since hydrogen production is optimal at acid ph a second way to contribute positively to hydrogen production in mixed culture fermentations is by slightly acidifying the local environ- ment of hpb in the reactor which can be achieved by lactic acidbacteria lab.

nevertheless the exact role and contribution of lab in hydrogen production ecosystems has not been fully elucidated and is probably underestimated as extensively discussed in the section 'syntrophic metabolism'.since a drastic acidification could be prejudicial to hydrogen production some bacteria are also thought to contribute pos- itively to the ecosystem service by oxidizing short-chain fatty acids and preventing their accumulation therefore buffering against a collapsing ph drop.

however when lactic acid was the only carbon source thelevel of hydrogen production was very low.in mixed cultures the positive effect of lactate can be ex- plained by its role as electron donor for hydrogen production.

given the crucial role of hydrogenase gene abundance in hydrogen production as evi- denced by empirical correlations several authors suggested that the enhancement of hydrogenase activity using genetic engi- neering would improve hydrogen production.

.in a brewery yeast waste fermentation system inoculated with c. butyricum hydrogen production rate and concentration were 2-fold higher than that of the same system inoculated with compost microflora the lag phase was shortened and the hydrogen production period in batch lasted longer jen et al.174fems microbiology reviews 2017 vol.

this limitation is partly due to the limited knowledge to date of the microbial ecology involved in hydro- gen production in mixed cultures.biofermenters used for hydrogen production from mixed cul- tures can be considered as model ecosystems where environ- mental and operating parameters are reliably monitored and controlled and can therefore be useful to elucidate the links between microbial community features and ecosystem services such as organic matter degradation and h2 production.

as 'conventionally' main hydrogen producersclostridia are commonly considered as the most abundant and most efficient hpb in hydrogen reactors since they are usu- ally predominant during the periods of highest hydrogen pro- duction efficiency providing to reach h2 yields from 1.5 to 3 molh2molhexose maintinguer et al.
