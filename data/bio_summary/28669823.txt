However from the chromatograms it can be concluded that all three ferulic acid oligosaccharides were completely hydrolyzed by each enzyme.Although the tested substrates confirmed that each of the two enzymes can liberate ferulic acid from variously substituted side chains ferulic acid oligo- saccharides with a higher molecular weight were not analyzed in this approach.

The incubation with BiFae1A and BiFae1B led to the complete disappearance of all peaks associated with ferulic acid oligosaccharides as well as the liberation of ferulic acid.

As suggested from the AmCE1 structure the relatively closed nature of the BiFae1A active site compared with ferulic acid esterases such as the C. thermocellum FAEXynZ that lack a loop or b-clamp motif around the active site supports our reported exolytic activity demonstrating cleavage of individual ferulic acid moieties from arabinoxylan oligosaccharides.Because we did not obtain a crystal structure for the BiFae1B enzyme we aligned the sequence of this enzyme with its closest homolog in the PDB in order to highlight potential differences from BiFae1A.

It is possible that the likely structural differences in the active sites of BiFae1A and BiFae1B equip the cell with the ability to remove ferulic acid or other hydroxycinnamic acids from a variety of substrates.Because the two enzymes hydrolyze a variety of feruloylated arabinoxylan oligosaccharides it is likely that they are also able to liberate ferulic acid from polysaccharides.

The flow rate was 0.5 mLmin and the following gradient composed of A water with 0.1 formic acid and B acetonitrile with 0.1 formic acid was used at 45 degC 0-20 min isocratic 85 A and 15 B 20-35 min linear to 100 B 35-40 min isocratic 100 B and 40-45 min isocratic 85 A and 15 B. UV detection was carried out at 325 nm and a standard curve was used to determine the ferulic acid content of the hydrolysates.Optimum pH and optimum temperatureThe optimum pH was determined by incubating the enzymes 50 nM with pNP-acetate 250 mM at 37 degC in 0.1 M MOPS buffer with different pH values 6.5 7.0 7.25 7.5 7.75 8.0.

Insoluble wheat arabinoxylan 1 was incubated for 2 h at 37 degC with increasing concentrations of BiFae1A and BiFae1B and ferulic acid concentrations were determined by HPLC-DAD.the polypeptides migrated to the corresponding calculated molecular masses BiFae1A 33.2 kDa BiFae1B 71.1 kDa.

As ferulic acid is usually bound to complex polysaccharides the ability of the enzymes to liberate ferulic acid from a natural polymeric substrate was tested.

Indeed the variability in this region is best highlighted by comparison with the Streptococcus EstA rmsd 1.1 A for 168 atom pairs 25 sequence identity which is perhaps most similar in structure to BiFae1A and displays a flexible loop that caps the active site c. Interestingly Butyrivibrio Est1E rmsd 1.1 A for 86 atoms pairs shares structural homology with BiFae1A including an elongated loop surrounding the active site yet has only 15 sequence identity c.Because of the extensive enzymatic and structural characterization of the AmCE1 we used the structure of this enzyme with bound ferulic acid PDB 5CXX to identify the active site of BiFae1A as well as residues that likely position the substrate b and d. BiFae1A shares 27 amino acid sequence identity with AmCE1 and has an rmsd of 0.917 A over 129 atoms pairs.

The two proteins have been designated BiFae1A and BiFae1B respectively after demonstration that they harbor ferulic acid esterase activities.The polypeptide of BiFae1A is composed of one CE1 domain a and is in close genomic proximity to the xylanolytic enzymes characterized by Wang et al.

It was also observed that BiFae1A liberated a notably higher amount of ferulic acid than BiFae1B under the conditions used.
