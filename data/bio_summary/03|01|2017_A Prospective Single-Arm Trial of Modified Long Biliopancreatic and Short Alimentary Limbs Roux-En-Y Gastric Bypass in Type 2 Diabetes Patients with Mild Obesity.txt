The aim of this RYGB model with a 200-cm biliopancreatic and 50-cm alimentary limbs is to optimize the metabolic component of the procedure avoiding mechanical restriction and malabsorption probably contributing to the non-excessive weight loss.Despite the longer proximal exclusion in this model of RYGB the frequency of bowel movements had a mean of 1.8 movements per day much lower than the mean frequency after malabsorptive procedures as the biliopancreatic diversions with duodenal switch or Scopinaro's technique which have a mean frequency of 3.2 and up to4 movements per day respectively  .Other relevant data were the high control rates of hyperten- sion and dyslipidemia 89.4 and 85 respectively better than some reports following conventional RYGB in lower BMIs .

Randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate the metabolic superiority of the long biliopancreatic and short alimentary limbs RYGB com- pared to the conventional model of RYGB and shift the para- digm on the mechanisms involved in this operation.ConclusionLong biliopancreatic and short alimentary limbs RYGB is safe and seems effective in achieving complete control of type 2 diabetes in patients with BMI 30 to 35 kgm2 as well as control of hypertension and dyslipidemia without excessive weight loss and malnutrition in short and midterm follow up.

Although not definitive this unicentric prospective trial stimu- lates further research on comparing long biliopancreatic and short alimentary RYGB versus Bstandard limbs RYGB in a randomized controlled trial.Funding There was no financial support for this study.Compliance with Ethical StandardsConflict of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethical Approval IRB approved.Informed Consent Obtained for every patient.ReferencesAngrisani L Santonicola A Iovino P et al.

On the other hand at least as demonstrated in rodents enlarging the biliopancreatic limb may lead to better metabolic outcomes in T2D patients en- hancing the mechanisms of improvement after surgery .This is a prospective single-arm study that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the RYGB with a 200-cm-long biliopancreatic limb and an alimentary limb of 50 cm in the control of T2D in patients with BMIs between 30 and 35 kg m2.

compared short and long biliopancreatic limbs up to 150 cm and showed a higher rate of complete remission of T2D among patients who underwent an RYGB with longer biliopancreatic limbs .

In this trial both the alimentary and biliopancreatic limbs were enlarged making it difficult to disclose the primary factor for improvement in the Benlarged limbs group.In the current study figuring a RYGB with a biliopancreatic limb of 200 cm there was a high glycemic control rate with more than 92 of patients in complete control of T2D during follow-up.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RYGB with a Abdon Jose Murad Jr 1 Center for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Sao Domingos Hospital Sao Luis Brazil2 The Center for Obesity and Diabetes Oswaldo Cruz German Hospital Sao Paulo Brazil3 Surgical Clinic Unit Onofre Lopes University Hospital Natal Brazil4 Gastro-Obeso-Center Advanced Institute for Digestive and Bariatric Surgery Sao Paulo Brazil5 Service for Obesity and Related Diseases Surgery Surgical Clinic Unit Onofre Lopes University Hospital Natal Brazil6 Service for Bariatric Surgery Gastro Clinica Campina Grande Brazil7 Technology and Healthcare Unit Oswaldo Cruz German Hospital Sao Paulo Brazil8 Federal University of Maranhao Sao Luis Brazilbiliopancreatic limb of 200 cm in the control of T2D in pa- tients with BMI 30-35 kgm2.Methods From January 2011 to May 2015 102 T2D patients with BMI from 30 to 34.9 kgm2 underwent laparoscopic RYGB with the biliopancreatic-limb of 200 cm and the alimentary-limb of 50 cm.Results There were no deaths or reoperations.

Although there are good results of Bconventional standard limbs RYGB  in patients with BMI below 35 kgm2 in most of the published studies stan- dard RYGB has failed to achieve high rates of T2D remission in this lower BMI population.

No patient developed hypoalbuminemia and there were mild micronutrient deficiencies.Conclusions RYGB with long-biliopancreatic and short- alimentary limbs is safe and seems effective in achieving com- plete control of T2D in patients with BMIs between 30 and 35 kgm2.Keywords Long biliopancreatic limb .

All underwent a laparoscopic RYGB with a biliopancreatic limb of 200 cm and an alimentary limb of 50 cm from January 2011 to May 2015 at the Center for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery of Sao Domingos Hospital in Sao Luis Maranhao Brazil.
