randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate the metabolic superiority of the long biliopancreatic and short alimentary limbs rygb com- pared to the conventional model of rygb and shift the para- digm on the mechanisms involved in this operation.conclusionlong biliopancreatic and short alimentary limbs rygb is safe and seems effective in achieving complete control of type 2 diabetes in patients with bmi 30 to 35 kgm2 as well as control of hypertension and dyslipidemia without excessive weight loss and malnutrition in short and midterm follow up.

the aim of this rygb model with a 200-cm biliopancreatic and 50-cm alimentary limbs is to optimize the metabolic component of the procedure avoiding mechanical restriction and malabsorption probably contributing to the non-excessive weight loss.despite the longer proximal exclusion in this model of rygb the frequency of bowel movements had a mean of 1.8 movements per day much lower than the mean frequency after malabsorptive procedures as the biliopancreatic diversions with duodenal switch or scopinaro's technique which have a mean frequency of 3.2 and up to4 movements per day respectively  .other relevant data were the high control rates of hyperten- sion and dyslipidemia 89.4 and 85 respectively better than some reports following conventional rygb in lower bmis .

on the other hand at least as demonstrated in rodents enlarging the biliopancreatic limb may lead to better metabolic outcomes in t2d patients en- hancing the mechanisms of improvement after surgery .this is a prospective single-arm study that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the rygb with a 200-cm-long biliopancreatic limb and an alimentary limb of 50 cm in the control of t2d in patients with bmis between 30 and 35 kg m2.

compared short and long biliopancreatic limbs up to 150 cm and showed a higher rate of complete remission of t2d among patients who underwent an rygb with longer biliopancreatic limbs .

in this trial both the alimentary and biliopancreatic limbs were enlarged making it difficult to disclose the primary factor for improvement in the benlarged limbs group.in the current study figuring a rygb with a biliopancreatic limb of 200 cm there was a high glycemic control rate with more than 92 of patients in complete control of t2d during follow-up.

although not definitive this unicentric prospective trial stimu- lates further research on comparing long biliopancreatic and short alimentary rygb versus bstandard limbs rygb in a randomized controlled trial.funding there was no financial support for this study.compliance with ethical standardsconflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.ethical approval irb approved.informed consent obtained for every patient.referencesangrisani l santonicola a iovino p et al.

type-2 diabetesintroductionroux-en-y gastric bypass rygb is one of the most com- mon bariatric operations performed worldwide allowing ex- cess weight loss about 65-70 and adequate long-term con- trol of comorbidities mainly type 2 diabetes t2d .

.discussionalthough rygb has been performed for decades there are few studies on the influence of the length of the intestinal limbs over diabetes remission.

greater weight loss was also associated with longer biliopancreatic limb .therefore of the known mechanisms of glycemic control in bariatricmetabolic surgery at least five of them distal incretin stimulation proximal bowel exclusion alterations in bile acids alterations in microbiota and weight loss can be optimized with the elongation of the biliopancreatic limb.biliopancreatic limbs of 200 cm were also employed by nora et al.
