Using the MinION read lengths larger than 100 kb study various aspects related to antibiotic resistance and infection microbiology including determining the structure and chromosomal insertion site of a bacterial antibiotic re- sistance island in Salmonella Typhi  detection of car- bapenemases and ESBL genes and their genomic location in Gram-negative pathogenic isolates  and identifi- cation of species and resistance profiles of Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates .

Nanopore sequencing is thus able to identify such differing contexts of antibi- otic resistance genes which can impact the probability of a pathogen to acquire specific antibiotic resistance genes .DISCUSSIONHospital settings including ICUs are hotspots for the emergence and selection for antibiotic resistant organisms.

The attC region is a repeat sequence which typically flanks a resistance cassette dfrA encodes a dihydrofolate reductase known to confer resistance against trimethoprim aadA is an aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase known to confer resistance to spectinomycin and ybeA also known as orfX which is a pseudocassette and present as conserved 3 fragment in class 2 integrons .ing Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database CARD .

A variety of antibiotic resistance genes were detected with a mean sequence identity of 97.3 including beta lactamase genes blaCTX-M blaTEM and cblA genes cod- ing aminoglycoside modifying proteins from different sub- classes of AAC ANT and APH enzymes and diverse genes encoding ribosomal and efflux mediated resistance towards tetracycline antibiotics among others Figure and Supple- mentary Figure S3.

Antibiotic resistance databases such as CARD are commonly used to identify antibiotic resistance genes in metagenomic sequencing data .

Fi- nally the error corrected reads were polished using nanopo- lish  which uses the raw nanopore event data to increase the accuracy.We annotated the error corrected and polished sequenc- ing data for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes us-Figure 5.

Yet based on our observation 33.8 inserts had no identifiably match in CARD indicating the further potential for discoveries of novel antibiotic resistance genes from the human gut Fig- ure .To validate the nanopore sequencing results we se- quenced the same barcoded DNA using PacBio SMRT technology yielding 93.5 Mbase of DNA in 68 144 reads with 99 accuracy from two sequencing cells.

After an- notation with the CARD database we observed that the ex- act same set of 26 antibiotic resistance genes detected in the nanopore dataset were also present in the PacBio datasetFigure .

2014 MinION nanopore sequencing identifies the position and structure of a bacterial antibiotic resistance island.

The gut microbiome comprises a diverse set of antibiotic resistance genes which may impact antibiotic treatment out- comes in at least two ways .
