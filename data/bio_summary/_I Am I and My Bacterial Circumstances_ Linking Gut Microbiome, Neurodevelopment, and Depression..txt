with the objective to understand the role played by microbiome in both human health and human disease there are born different research consortiums around the world such as the international human microbiome consortium the irish eldermet project the german verbund optimd im forschungsnetz fur psychische erkrankungen or optimd consortium the international project metagenomics of the human intestinal tract or metahit project and the american nih human microbiome project.

for example results from a double blind placebo-controlled randomized study with adult prison- ers showed that a nutritional supplementation of efas miner- als and vitamins was associated with an antisocial behavior improvement .one of the most significant findings to emerge from different studies about human microbiome is that perturbations of thehost-microbiota are associated with an increased risk for differ- ent diseases    including gastrointestinal diseases  dermatological illness  obesity   type 1 diabetes neurodegenerative illness  neuropsychiatric diseases neuroimmune diseases   and rheumatic disorders   where changes in the interactions between microbiome and host immune system have been proposed as important etiological factors .

however the whole association between microbiome and different diseases is still unknown .the gut microbiome and the nervous system the microbiome-gut-brain axisthe gut-brain gb axis  is a complex system that integrates the gut with the nervous system  .

in general gut microbiota play an important role in human energy homeostasis.the gut microbiome andneurodevelopmentour bacterial composition this one that we have during our adult life starts to be acquired during our early life  being the mother the main element defining the characteristics of the infant's microbiome .

in general in the human life cycle there are pre- natal and postnatal environmental factors that play an importantrole defining the characteristics of each microbiome   and during the different host life cycles have been observed microbiota age-related changes that could be determined by microbiota's genes .evidence suggests that there is an important role played by gut microbiome in human brain development.

psychiatry 8153.doi recently there has been renewed interest in the role played by microbiome in both human health and human disease.

moreover the gut microbiome influences both central nervous system and energy homeostasis.

an altered gut microbiome has been associated with the pathophysiology of different diseases including neuropsychiatric disorders.

apparently both environmental--diet exposition to antibiotics and infections--and host-genetic factors have a strong influence on gut microbiome modulating the risk for neuropsy- chiatric illness.

also early life disruption of the microbiome-gut-brain mgb axis has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression later in life suggesting a link between gut microbiome neurodevelopment and depression.

this review aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the role played by the gut micro- biome in neurodevelopment and in the etiology of the depressive syndrome including nutritional immunological and energy homeostasis approaches.keywords gut microbiome neurodevelopment depression neuroimmune-endocrine system microbiome- gut-brain axis hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis energy homeostasis nutritionthe title of this review is a paraphrase of the maxim from ortega y gasset yo soy yo y mi circunstan- cia y si no la salvo a ella no me salvo yo i am i and my circumstance and if i do not save it i do not save myself 1.introductionour world has an extraordinary diversity of life forms.

sometimes this term is used in the scientific literature as synonym of microbiotamicrobiome-gut-brain mgb axis bidirectional connection between the gastrointestinal tract and the cns including the gastrointestinal microbiome.

in order to avoid any confusion in this paper we will use the term microbiome to refer to both the microbes and their genetic materials as unit and not as synonym of the term microbiota.
