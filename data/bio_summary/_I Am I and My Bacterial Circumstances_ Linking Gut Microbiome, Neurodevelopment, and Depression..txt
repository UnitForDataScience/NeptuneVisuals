There is evidence that signals from the afferent vagal system are also transmitted to brain regions outside the hypothalamus such as insula stria terminalis and amygdalae .Since the gut microbiome may influence the central nervous system CNS   it has been proposed to include the micro- biome as part of this axis  being known as microbiome-gut- brain MGB axis  or microbiota-gut-brain axis  .

This review aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the role played by the gut micro- biome in neurodevelopment and in the etiology of the depressive syndrome including nutritional immunological and energy homeostasis approaches.Keywords gut microbiome neurodevelopment depression neuroimmune-endocrine system microbiome- gut-brain axis hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis energy homeostasis nutritionThe title of this review is a paraphrase of the maxim from Ortega y Gasset Yo soy yo y mi circunstan- cia y si no la salvo a ella no me salvo yo I am I and my circumstance and if I do not save it I do not save myself 1.iNTRODUCTiONOur world has an extraordinary diversity of life forms.

It has been noted that brain reactions via stress are able to alter gastrointestinal function  including gut microbiome compo- sition changes  and early life disruption of the MGB axis have been associated with later life neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression .To date numerous studies using probiotics have attempted to demonstrate MGB axis' communication .

Both microbiome alterations and MGB axis dysfunction have been linked to changes at the level of the HPA axis .

For example results from a double blind placebo-controlled randomized study with adult prison- ers showed that a nutritional supplementation of EFAs miner- als and vitamins was associated with an antisocial behavior improvement .One of the most significant findings to emerge from different studies about human microbiome is that perturbations of thehost-microbiota are associated with an increased risk for differ- ent diseases    including gastrointestinal diseases  dermatological illness  obesity   type 1 diabetes neurodegenerative illness  neuropsychiatric diseases neuroimmune diseases   and rheumatic disorders   where changes in the interactions between microbiome and host immune system have been proposed as important etiological factors .

In general in the human life cycle there are pre- natal and postnatal environmental factors that play an importantrole defining the characteristics of each microbiome   and during the different host life cycles have been observed microbiota age-related changes that could be determined by microbiota's genes .Evidence suggests that there is an important role played by gut microbiome in human brain development.

Also early life disruption of the microbiome-gut-brain MGB axis has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression later in life suggesting a link between gut microbiome neurodevelopment and depression.

Sometimes this term is used in the scientific literature as synonym of microbiotaMicrobiome-gut-brain MGB axis bidirectional connection between the gastrointestinal tract and the CNS including the gastrointestinal microbiome.

However the whole association between microbiome and different diseases is still unknown .The Gut Microbiome and the Nervous System The Microbiome-Gut-Brain AxisThe gut-brain GB axis  is a complex system that integrates the gut with the nervous system  .

It has been suggested that gut microbiome influences the CNS by modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis immune system neurotransmitter pathways and growth factors  .
