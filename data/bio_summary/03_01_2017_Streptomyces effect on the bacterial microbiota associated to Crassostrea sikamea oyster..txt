these differences can be explained by an eigen- value 1 and a cumulative variance of 85-8 pc1  57-9 and pc2  27-9 in nondepurated oys- ters and of 83-5 pc1  55-9 and pc2  27-6 in depurated oysters.a statistically significant change in the bacterial com- munity composition was observed in nondepurated oys- ters treated with streptomyces strain n7 but not with streptomyces strain rl8 when compared with the non- depurated control group.
