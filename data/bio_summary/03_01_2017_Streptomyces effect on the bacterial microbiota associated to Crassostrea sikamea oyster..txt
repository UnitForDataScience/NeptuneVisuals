These differences can be explained by an eigen- value 1 and a cumulative variance of 85-8 PC1  57-9 and PC2  27-9 in nondepurated oys- ters and of 83-5 PC1  55-9 and PC2  27-6 in depurated oysters.A statistically significant change in the bacterial com- munity composition was observed in nondepurated oys- ters treated with Streptomyces strain N7 but not with Streptomyces strain RL8 when compared with the non- depurated control group.

These organisms are especially sensitive to infectious diseases as they arefilter-feeding animals who are released in early ontogenic stages and share the environment with both beneficial bacteria and potential pathogens Prado et al.

Although being of great value it has been shownover the years that the use of antibiotics in aquaculture has several drawbacks which may include toxicity lack of effectiveness and an unfavourable alteration of the micro- biota Verschuere et al.
