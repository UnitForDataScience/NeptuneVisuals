A phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains LMG 28358T LMG 28359T LMG 29879T and LMG 29880T and their closest neighbours is shown in The latter phylogenetic tree also includes the 16S rRNA gene sequences of various novel Gilliamella strains isolated recently from north American bumblebee gut samples The 16S rRNA gene sequence identities of strains LMG 28358T LMG 28359T LMG 29879T LMG 29880T and G. apicola NCIMB 14804T varied between98.4 and 99.9 demonstrating that the novel isolates should be classified into the genus Gilliamella.To further elucidate the genotypic relationship between these five strains draft whole genome sequences were determined and ANIm values were calculated The ANIm values of strains LMG 28358T LMG 28359T LMG 29879T LMG 29880T and NCIMB14804T varied between 84.26 and 92.13 indicating that each ofthese strains represents a distinct species The DNA G  C content of LMG 28358T LMG 29879T LMG 29880T and LMG 28359Tis 34.6 34.6 35.5 and 35.9 respectively which is comparable to that of G. apicola NCIMB 14804T 33.6.As in G. apicola NCIMB 14804T the major fatty acids are C160 and C181 w7c Table S2.

The MEGA6 software package was used to align the sequences obtained with the corresponding sequence of their phylogenetic neighbour species by MUSCLE and to obtain phylogenetic trees by using the maximum-likelihood method and the general time-reversible model with invariant sites The robustness of the tree topolo- gies was estimated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates MEGA6 was also used to calculate the sequence similarity levels.RAPD fingerprintingRandom amplified polymorphic DNA RAPD analysis using primer RAPD-272 as described by Williams et al.

The following steps were then performed for assembly fil- tered Illumina reads were assembled using Velvet version 1.2.07 1-3 kb simulated paired end reads were created from Vel- vet contigs using wgsim version 0.3.0   and Illumina reads were assembled with simulated read pairs using Allpaths-LG version r46652 The genomes of strains LMG 29879T and LMG 29880T were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform.

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analysed.

The phenotypic characteristics of the strains correspond with the ones reported earlier Differential phenotypic characteristics between the representative strains and between these strains and G. apicola NCIMB 14804T are presented in The strains did not degrade pectin from citrus peel or polygalac- turonic acid when grown on MP-7 medium or on AC agar with polygalacturonic acid.

Several studies highlighted the importance of the gut microbiota of honeybees and bumblebees in maintaining bee health The gut microbiota composition of honeybees and bumblebees is similar and consists of a specific and consistent set of bacteria of which a gammaproteobacterium referred to as Gamma-1 a betaproteobacterium referred to as Beta and a firmicutes referred to as Firm-5 phylotype occur in most bee indi- viduals Some isolates belonging to each of these three phylotypes have already been characterised and have been for- mally named Gilliamella apicola Snodgrassella alvi and Lactobacillus bombicola respectively Some Gamma-1 phylotype bacteria are able to degrade pectin which is a compound of the pollen cell wall and ferment mannose arabinose xylose and rhamnose which Corresponding author.

Identifications as B. lapidarius and B. terrestris were confirmed through cytochrome oxi- dase I COI gene sequence analysis as the colour pattern of these species can be confused with that of some other Bombus species The COI gene was amplified as described by Carolan et al.0723-2020c 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The crops and guts were homogenised in 125 ul saline solution 0.1 peptone 0.1 Tween 80 0.85 NaCl with a sterile micro-pestle.
