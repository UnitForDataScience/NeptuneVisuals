With ribaxamase the gut microbiomes were not significantly different from pretreatment and antibiotic resistance gene frequency was not increased.Conclusion Ribaxamase mitigated CRO-mediated gut microbiome dysbiosis and attenuated propagation of the antibiotic resistance genes in pigs.Significance and Impact of the Study Damage of the microbiome can lead to overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and antibiotic exposure can promote selection for antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms.

2016.Efficacy studies with jejunal-fistulated dogs treated with ribaxamase andor IV CRO showed that CRO was elimi- nated from the intestine in the presence of ribaxamase and that ribaxamase remained biologically active for at least 8 hours the duration of antibiotic release into the intestine Kaleko et al.

To verify that ribaxamase did not affect systemic CRO levels in the pigs animals that received CRO alone and animals that received CROribaxamase had blood drawn on day 2 of antibiotic treatment which corresponds to day 3 of ribaxamase delivery.

5a showed CRO was associated with higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes post-treatment day 4 compared with CRO ribaxamase microbiomes.

Analyses revealed pigs treated with CRO dis- played increased frequency of antibiotic resistance genes compared with animals receiving CROribaxamase.Antibiotic resistance genes enriched in microbiomes of pigs treated with CRO encoded beta-lactamases compo- nents of multidrug efflux transporter systems and the phosphotransferase aminoglycosidestrA McArthur et al.

Irrespective of the mechanisms of selection for antibiotic resistance CRO treatment increased the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes while ribaxamase attenuated this enrichment.Initially ribaxamase is intended for use with IV beta- lactam antibiotics.

Pigs 20 kg n  10 were treated with ceftriaxone CRO IV 50 mg kg-1 SID for 7 days and a cohort n  5 received ribaxamase PO 75 mg QID for 9 days beginning the day before antibiotic administration.

Ceftriaxone serum levels were not statistically different in the antibiotic-alone and antibiotic  ribaxamase groups indicating ribaxamase did not alter systemic antibiotic levels.

Whole-genome metagenomic analyses of pig faecal DNA revealed that CRO caused significant changes to the gut microbiome and an increased frequency of antibiotic resistance genes.

2016 was engineered from the P1A enzyme to broaden its antibiotic degradation profile to include cephalosporins such as CRO while maintain- ing penicillinase activity Kaleko et al.
