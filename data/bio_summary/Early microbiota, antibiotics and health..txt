How- ever given our increasing understanding on the importance of the early life microbiota it could be wise to avoid the administration of antibiotics when there is not a clear indica- tion of use to optimize the spectrum of the antibiotics used the duration of the treatment and the route of administration as well as to develop strategies for limiting their impact on the microbiota.Effect of early life antibiotics in disease-riskAs indicated previously the early microbiota establishment process and its further development is determined by several factors.

These results should open the debate on the need for immediate action to minimize or limit the impact of early life antibiotics on the microbiota establishment process while we decipher and fully understand the role of early microbiota on human health.Acknowledgements The work carried out in the authors' laboratories on the early life microbiota is founded by the EU Joint ProgrammingInitiative--A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life JPI HDHL  and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO Project EarlyMicroHealth.

Similar studies have also shown that early life antibiotic treatment hampers the proper development of immune responses  .Obesity has also been related to early life antibiotics administration .

This opens ques- tions of enormous importance on the true role of early life antibiotic-induced microbiota alterations on the currently observed increased incidence of metabolic and autoimmune disorders.Antibiotics and the human gut resistome a pending taskSurprisingly almost no data is available on the impact of early life antibiotics in the harboring of antibiotic resistance genes by the gut microbiota .

Moreover early empiric antibiotic use has been associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis NEC sepsis and death in premature babies .The extensive exposure to antibiotics is not restricted topreterm babies and the hospital setting overall more than half of the infants have been treated with antibiotics dur- ing the first months of age .

To this regard several reports have indicated reduced levels of microorganisms such as Bacteroides or Bifidobacterium and increased levels of certain Firmicutes or Proteobacteria in CS delivered babies     and similar changes on the micro-biota composition have been observed as a consequence of perinatal antibiotics  .The large evidence substantiating the alteration of the neonatal microbiota in CS delivered babies has prompted researchers to propose the deliberated inoculation of these infants with their mothers' vaginal microbiota as a way to promote microbiota development .Use of antibiotics during the postnatal periodAntibiotics are the early life medication most frequently administered in neonatal intensive care units NICUs  with premature babies being the group receiving more empiric antibiotic treatments during the first days of life .

Among the perinatal factors poten- tially affecting the microbiota development in the newborn the use of antibiotics represents the most common threat.Impact of antibiotics upon the establishing microbiotaUse of antibiotics during pregnancyPregnancy is characterized by simultaneous endocrine met- abolic and immune changes aimed at supporting the correct growth and development of the fetus .

Exposure to antibiotics either prenatally or postnatally is common in early life mainly due to the use of intrapartum prophylaxis or to the administration of antibi- otics in C-section deliveries.

However we are still far from understanding the impact of early antibiotics and their long- term effects.

Increased risk of non-communicable diseases such as allergies or obesity has been observed in individuals exposed to antibiotics during early infancy.
