how- ever given our increasing understanding on the importance of the early life microbiota it could be wise to avoid the administration of antibiotics when there is not a clear indica- tion of use to optimize the spectrum of the antibiotics used the duration of the treatment and the route of administration as well as to develop strategies for limiting their impact on the microbiota.effect of early life antibiotics in disease-riskas indicated previously the early microbiota establishment process and its further development is determined by several factors.

these results should open the debate on the need for immediate action to minimize or limit the impact of early life antibiotics on the microbiota establishment process while we decipher and fully understand the role of early microbiota on human health.acknowledgements the work carried out in the authors' laboratories on the early life microbiota is founded by the eu joint programminginitiative--a healthy diet for a healthy life jpi hdhl  and the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness mineco project earlymicrohealth.

in this article we review and discuss the above-mentioned issues with the aim of encour- aging debate on the actions needed for understanding the impact of early life antibiotics upon human microbiota and health and for developing strategies aimed at minimizing this impact.keywords infant  microbiota  antibiotics  intrapartum- antimicrobial-prophylaxisintroductionthe gut microbiota is the wide complex and diverse col- lection of microorganisms living in the intestine including bacteria archaea viruses and unicellular eukaryotes.

among the perinatal factors poten- tially affecting the microbiota development in the newborn the use of antibiotics represents the most common threat.impact of antibiotics upon the establishing microbiotause of antibiotics during pregnancypregnancy is characterized by simultaneous endocrine met- abolic and immune changes aimed at supporting the correct growth and development of the fetus .

to this regard several reports have indicated reduced levels of microorganisms such as bacteroides or bifidobacterium and increased levels of certain firmicutes or proteobacteria in cs delivered babies     and similar changes on the micro-biota composition have been observed as a consequence of perinatal antibiotics  .the large evidence substantiating the alteration of the neonatal microbiota in cs delivered babies has prompted researchers to propose the deliberated inoculation of these infants with their mothers' vaginal microbiota as a way to promote microbiota development .use of antibiotics during the postnatal periodantibiotics are the early life medication most frequently administered in neonatal intensive care units nicus  with premature babies being the group receiving more empiric antibiotic treatments during the first days of life .

moreover early empiric antibiotic use has been associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis nec sepsis and death in premature babies .the extensive exposure to antibiotics is not restricted topreterm babies and the hospital setting overall more than half of the infants have been treated with antibiotics dur- ing the first months of age .

similar studies have also shown that early life antibiotic treatment hampers the proper development of immune responses  .obesity has also been related to early life antibiotics administration .

this opens ques- tions of enormous importance on the true role of early life antibiotic-induced microbiota alterations on the currently observed increased incidence of metabolic and autoimmune disorders.antibiotics and the human gut resistome a pending tasksurprisingly almost no data is available on the impact of early life antibiotics in the harboring of antibiotic resistance genes by the gut microbiota .

exposure to antibiotics either prenatally or postnatally is common in early life mainly due to the use of intrapartum prophylaxis or to the administration of antibi- otics in c-section deliveries.

however we are still far from understanding the impact of early antibiotics and their long- term effects.

increased risk of non-communicable diseases such as allergies or obesity has been observed in individuals exposed to antibiotics during early infancy.

more specifically the population of lactobacilli seems to be reduced whereas other populations such as proteobac- teria firmicutes or the clostridium cluster xiva have been reported to be affected as well -.use of antibiotics during deliveryintrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of early onset group b streptococcus infection dur- ing the 70's decade group b streptococci gbs were the main infectious agents causing morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period in developed countries  .

however given their extensive use in the medical practice the exposure to antibiotics in cs deliveries can be an important confounding factor in the study of the gut microbiota establishment being difficult to isolate the cs-effects from those attributable to iap or to postpartum antibiotics.

in this regard it is well known that maternal antibiotics alter the breast milk microbiota  and that some antibiotics may cross the placenta .in spite of the effects stated above it is important to understand that in many circumstances treatment with anti- biotics is the most prudent medical option.

the use of antibiotics influences microbiota-host crosstalk during the critical neonatal period therefore being one of the factors that may have profound consequences for later health  .in relation with the hygiene hypothesis different epide- miological studies have reported a link between early anti- biotics exposure and allergic disease later in life  .
