the goals of the pre- sent work were to investigate the effects of gln and arg on serum immune parameters distal intestinal structure intestinal inflammation-related cytokine expression and intestinal mucosal microbiota of turbot fed the sbm-containing diet.materials and methodsfeed ingredients and diet formulationbased on our previous work  a soybean meal based diet sbm diet was formulated to contain 48 crude protein and 12 crude lipid with soybean meal and fish meal as the primary protein sources fish oil and soybean oil as lipid sources and wheat flour as the carbohydrate source .

another two isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formu- lated based on the sbm diet with the addition of 1.5 glutamine gln diet or 1.5 supplement of arginine arg diet.

fish fed the gln or arg diet showed significantly increased height of mucosal folds and supra-nuclear absorptive vacuoles and decreased cellular leucocyte infiltration in both lamina propria and submucosa compared with those fed the sbm diet p  0.05  .the tem data showed that dietary gln or arg significantly changed the structure of the distal intestinal microvilli .

the interpretation of all diversity indices as a whole suggested that 1 the arg diet decreased bacterial di- versity compared to the sbm diet and 2 dietary gln or arg altered the composition of the native intestinal bacteria communities.
