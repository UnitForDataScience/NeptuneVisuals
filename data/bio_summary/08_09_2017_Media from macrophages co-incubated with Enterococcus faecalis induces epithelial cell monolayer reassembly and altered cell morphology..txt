After 18 hours of co-incubation of epithelial cells with CMs phase contrast microscopy demonstrated that J774 WT CM and J774DDGS CM induced clear reassembly of epithelial monolayers and striking morphological changes in adherent cells characterized by mesenchymal-like morphology in both epithelial lines .

Confocal microscopy of the luminal side of the explants demonstrated that incubation with J774WT CM led to epithelial cell depletion and epithelial layer reorganization in com- parison to J774 CM alone .CD44CD24 cell populations are enriched in epithelial cells treated with macrophageE.

Taken together these findings provide evidence for a triangulated molecular dialogue between E. faecalis macrophages and colonic epithelial cells which may have important implications for condi- tions in the gut that involve inflammation injury or tumorigenesis.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.IntroductionDynamic crosstalk between intestinal epithelial cells IECs the microbes that colonize their apical surface and the surrounding local immune cells is necessary to maintain intestinal homeostasis .

faecalis CMs demonstrates reassembly of epithelial monolayer and morphological changes of adherent epithelial cells when J774E.

faecalis CMs affect intercellular junctions in epithelial monolayersIt is known that changes of epithelial cells morphology depend on cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion .

Cell-cell contact is maintained via intercellular junction proteins which through connections to the actin cytoskeleton coordinate cellular organization maintain the integrity of epithelial monolayer and control phenotypic transition of epithelial cells  .

A proposed model of epithelial monolayer reassembly presented on .We assumed that disruption of epithelial monolayer integrity begins as a process of cell extrusion whereby detached anchorage-dependent cells undergo anoikis which is a form of programmed cell death.

Explants were incubated for 6 hours with J774 CM and J774WT CMChanges in expression and localization of epithelial cell-cell junction proteins E-cadherin and ZO-1 after 18 h of treatment of epithelial cell monolayers with macrophageE.

faecalis CMs independent of GelESprEIn the present study we used a primary colonic epithelial cell line which was generated from normal mouse colon using the epithelial selective marker EpCAM-1 CD326 according to information presented by the vender Cell Biologics Chicago IL.

Consequently various types of colonic epithelial cells including stemprogenitors cells could be present in this cell line.Others have described primary colonic epithelial cell lines derived from normal human colon biopsies with progenitors cell features and the ability for self-renewal .
