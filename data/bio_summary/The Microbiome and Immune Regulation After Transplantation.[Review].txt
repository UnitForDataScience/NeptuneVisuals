Additionally gut microbiota have been linked to the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus postliver transplantation through alterations of host metabolic homeostasis by as yet unclear gut-liver axis mechanisms.57In kidney transplantation a recent pilot study was undertaken wherein comprehensive analysis of oral urine and stool microbiota was performed before as well as at 1 and 6 months after transplantation this revealed substantial changes after transplantation that persisted over time.58 In addition these changes were associated with acute rejection diarrhea and urinary tract infection rates posttransplantation with each complication having its own microbiological correlate eg a lower Shannon diversity index posttransplantation being a predictor of diarrhea.59Lung transplantation recipients also appear have alterations in the pulmonary microbial community based on analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage BAL specimens from 21 patients.

How the ensuing alterations and dysbiosis occur and affect alloresponses represents an exciting field of biomedical research.ALLOGRAFT REJECTION TOLERANCE POSTTRANSPLANT COMPLICATIONS AND THE MICROBIOMESolid organ transplantationThe increasingly recognized bidirectional interaction of human microbiota with the host and its immune system Figure 2 has sparked significant interest given its potential impact in posttransplantation outcomes including the prospect for generating novel preventative and therapeutic strategies to promote immunotolerance and mitigate allograft rejection and GVHD.With respect to liver transplantation investigators from China collected fecal and blood samples from 111 liver transplant recipients in China and found significant alterations in gut microbiota including lower levels of Eubacteria Bifidobacterium Faecalibacterium and Lactobacillus and higher levels of Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae in liver transplantation recipients except for Enterococcus all bacteria returned to normal levels 6 months posttransplantation.52 In another study decreased microbial diversity posttransplantation was associated with increased risk of postoperative infections.53 With respect to the microbiome and the underlying disease eg indication for liver transplantation a recent report described successful treatment of recurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis an idiopathic disease with emerging links to microbialdysbiosis.5 54 55 Variation of gut microbiota was found to predict early acute cellular rejection after liver transplantation in a rat model56 suggesting that a microbiota profile or alterations therein might hold promise as a predictor of acute rejection posttransplantation.

The 2 main types of Tregs are i naturally-occurring thymus-derived Tregs which are anergic to TCR stimulation and can suppress proliferation of other T cells18 and ii inducible Tregs which develop peripherally from naive T cells with acquisition of Foxp3 expression and in the setting of chronic antigenic stimulation and transforming growth factor TGF-b1.19 Tregs suppress effector T cells through secretion of inhibitory cytokines eg IL-10 interaction with CD80CD86 through CTLA-420 and functioning as cytotoxic T cells which destroy activated CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes via perforin-dependent mechanisms.21In preclinical models the enhancement of CD4CD25 T cells prevents allograft rejection in an IL-10 and CTLA-4 dependent manner22 likewise depletion of CD25 T lymphocytes results in accelerated rejection of allogeneic skin grafts and increases graft- versus-host disease GVHD-related mortality.23 Results of preliminary studies investigating the role of immunosuppressive properties of Tregs in GVHD appear promising.Natural Killer T lymphocytes NK-TsNK-Ts constitute less than 1 of all circulating lymphocytes but participate in critical cellular processes and signaling.

Several lines of evidence support the notion that this relationship is in fact reciprocal begins perinatally and is crucial for tissue eg mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and organ development.1 37 38 Differentiation of human myeloid cell progenitors has been shown to be suppressed in germ-free animals thus suggesting that the gut microbiome directs hematopoiesis differentiation and innate immune development.39 The gut microbiome has also been shown to potentially play a role in protecting against autoimmunity inoculation ofTabibian and KenderianPage 5mice with defined clostridial strains was found to elicit an immune response resulting in the accumulation of Tregs and resistance to colitis.40The orchestrating role of the microbiome in T lymphocyte differentiation in particular is of key importance in the setting of transplantation.

Ultimately a central goal in this context is safe efficient and effective assaying and manipulation of the microbiome--likely through a variety of pharmacologic and other minimally-invasive means eg fecal transplant--to better predict and enhance outcomes following solid organ and HSC transplantation.AcknowledgmentsFunding AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease AASLD 2014 Clinical and Translational Research Award to James H.

Indeed among small intestinal transplant recipients who experienced acute rejection Firmicutes and Lactobacillales were significantly reduced while Proteobacteria were increased in ileal effluents the overall findings suggested that microbiota profiling may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for risk of small intestinal allograft rejection.62The aforementioned findings suggest that monitoring the gut microbiome peritransplantation can provide a potentially useful surrogate marker for outcomes posttransplantation and manipulation of the microbiome may help realize improved outcomes in this regard.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCTHSCT has emerged as a potentially curative therapy for various hematological malignancies as well as nonmalignant diseases.

In melanoma murine models transplantation of microbiota with higher anti-tumor activity augmented T lymphocyte response and inhibited tumor growth after PDL1 inhibition the investigators were able to identify Bifidobacterium as the bacterium responsible for this suggesting that altering the amount of Bifidobacterium in humans can enhance anti-PDL1 treatment efficacy.67 In a similar vein Bacteroides has been found to have a key role in the immuno-stimulatory effect of CTLA-4 blockade tumors in antibiotic- treated mice did not respond to CTLA blockade while the adoptive transfer of B. fragilis- specific T lymphocytes resulted in significant CTLA-4 mediated anti-tumor effects.68Tabibian and KenderianPage 8The microbiome and GVHDThere is growing evidence that changes in the microbiome are linked to the pathogenesis and outcomes of GVHD.

Changes in the microbiome post-HSCT are also associated with subsequent bacteremia and fecal microbiota characteristics eg domination by Proteobacteria and Enterococcus appear to predict patients at greatest risk.64 In a study published this year abundance of Eubacterium limosum was found to be associated with less relapse while Enterococcus was associated with increased rates of relapse post-HSCT.65 Another study using next-generation sequencing of the V3 hypervariable region of the 16s rRNA gene on serial stool specimens in patients receiving HSCT observed a relative shift toward Enterococci post- transplantation.66The cross-talk between the microbiome and the host immune system has also been evident in recent studies which showed that alterations of the microbiome increased tumor infiltration lymphocytes and affected response to checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell therapy.

It occurs through clonal deletion via either T lymphocyte apoptosis development of T lymphocyte anergy andor suppression of alloreactive T lymphocytes by regulatory cells and inhibitory cytokines each of which are addressed hereinafter.13 Briefly T lymphocyte apoptosis is induced via 2 pathways14 i death receptor activation which occurs following antigenic stimulation of mature T lymphocytes and ii loss of growth factors eg IL-7 IL-15 with a shift toward a proapoptotic milieu.15 With regard to anergy it is a process that can be conceptualized as a quality-control mechanism through which lymphocyte expansionactivity is inhibited it provides the benefit of allograft tolerance without suppressing the immune system as a whole.IMMUNOREGULATORY CELLS AND TOLERANCE POST- TRANSPLANTATIONThe concept of acquired cellular and humoral tolerance to nonhost cells was first recognized decades ago.16 Among the most central of these are regulatory T lymphocytes Tregs but others are also noteworthy as summarized below and discussed in detail elsewhere.17Tregs highlights and relevance in transplantationTregs play a critical role in posttransplant tolerance induction and prevention of graft rejection.

Furthermore in murine models of GVHD eliminating Lactobacillis pre-HSCT aggravated GVHD whereas reintroducing it mediated significant protection against GVHD.69 In an effort to uncover the mechanisms of this process investigators have studied the effect of GVHD on Paneth cells and found that Paneth cells are targeted by GVHD70 this results in a marked reduction in expression of a-defensins which selectively kill noncommensal organisms.Molecular profiling showed overwhelming expansion of E. coli and subsequent bacteremia in these models.
