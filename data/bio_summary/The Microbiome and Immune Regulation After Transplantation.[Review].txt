the 2 main types of tregs are i naturally-occurring thymus-derived tregs which are anergic to tcr stimulation and can suppress proliferation of other t cells18 and ii inducible tregs which develop peripherally from naive t cells with acquisition of foxp3 expression and in the setting of chronic antigenic stimulation and transforming growth factor tgf-b1.19 tregs suppress effector t cells through secretion of inhibitory cytokines eg il-10 interaction with cd80cd86 through ctla-420 and functioning as cytotoxic t cells which destroy activated cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes via perforin-dependent mechanisms.21in preclinical models the enhancement of cd4cd25 t cells prevents allograft rejection in an il-10 and ctla-4 dependent manner22 likewise depletion of cd25 t lymphocytes results in accelerated rejection of allogeneic skin grafts and increases graft- versus-host disease gvhd-related mortality.23 results of preliminary studies investigating the role of immunosuppressive properties of tregs in gvhd appear promising.natural killer t lymphocytes nk-tsnk-ts constitute less than 1 of all circulating lymphocytes but participate in critical cellular processes and signaling.

it occurs through clonal deletion via either t lymphocyte apoptosis development of t lymphocyte anergy andor suppression of alloreactive t lymphocytes by regulatory cells and inhibitory cytokines each of which are addressed hereinafter.13 briefly t lymphocyte apoptosis is induced via 2 pathways14 i death receptor activation which occurs following antigenic stimulation of mature t lymphocytes and ii loss of growth factors eg il-7 il-15 with a shift toward a proapoptotic milieu.15 with regard to anergy it is a process that can be conceptualized as a quality-control mechanism through which lymphocyte expansionactivity is inhibited it provides the benefit of allograft tolerance without suppressing the immune system as a whole.immunoregulatory cells and tolerance post- transplantationthe concept of acquired cellular and humoral tolerance to nonhost cells was first recognized decades ago.16 among the most central of these are regulatory t lymphocytes tregs but others are also noteworthy as summarized below and discussed in detail elsewhere.17tregs highlights and relevance in transplantationtregs play a critical role in posttransplant tolerance induction and prevention of graft rejection.

ultimately a central goal in this context is safe efficient and effective assaying and manipulation of the microbiome--likely through a variety of pharmacologic and other minimally-invasive means eg fecal transplant--to better predict and enhance outcomes following solid organ and hsc transplantation.acknowledgmentsfunding acknowledgmentsthis work was supported by the american association for the study of liver disease aasld 2014 clinical and translational research award to james h. tabibian an award from the national cancer institute k12 ca090628 to saad s. kenderian and a grant from the predolin foundation to saad s. kenderian.abbreviations pagebalbronchoalveolar lavage bregsb regulatory lymphocytes fcscd8tcr- facilitating cells gvhdgraft-versus-host diseasehscthematopoietic stem cell transplantationilinterleukinifnsinterferonslpslipopolysaccharidemhcsmajor histocompatibility complexesnk-tsnatural killer t lymphocytesnlrsnucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptorspampspathogen-associated molecular patternspdcsplasmacytoid dendritic cells prrpattern-recognition receptors tgf-btransforming growth factor b tcrst cell receptorstlrstoll-like receptorstnf-atumor necrosis factor atregst regulatory lymphocytestabibian and kenderianpage 10referencesbartman c chong as alegre ml.

several lines of evidence support the notion that this relationship is in fact reciprocal begins perinatally and is crucial for tissue eg mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and organ development.1 37 38 differentiation of human myeloid cell progenitors has been shown to be suppressed in germ-free animals thus suggesting that the gut microbiome directs hematopoiesis differentiation and innate immune development.39 the gut microbiome has also been shown to potentially play a role in protecting against autoimmunity inoculation oftabibian and kenderianpage 5mice with defined clostridial strains was found to elicit an immune response resulting in the accumulation of tregs and resistance to colitis.40the orchestrating role of the microbiome in t lymphocyte differentiation in particular is of key importance in the setting of transplantation.

changes in the microbiome post-hsct are also associated with subsequent bacteremia and fecal microbiota characteristics eg domination by proteobacteria and enterococcus appear to predict patients at greatest risk.64 in a study published this year abundance of eubacterium limosum was found to be associated with less relapse while enterococcus was associated with increased rates of relapse post-hsct.65 another study using next-generation sequencing of the v3 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene on serial stool specimens in patients receiving hsct observed a relative shift toward enterococci post- transplantation.66the cross-talk between the microbiome and the host immune system has also been evident in recent studies which showed that alterations of the microbiome increased tumor infiltration lymphocytes and affected response to checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive t cell therapy.

furthermore in murine models of gvhd eliminating lactobacillis pre-hsct aggravated gvhd whereas reintroducing it mediated significant protection against gvhd.69 in an effort to uncover the mechanisms of this process investigators have studied the effect of gvhd on paneth cells and found that paneth cells are targeted by gvhd70 this results in a marked reduction in expression of a-defensins which selectively kill noncommensal organisms.molecular profiling showed overwhelming expansion of e. coli and subsequent bacteremia in these models.

these microorganisms collectively referred to as the microbiome play a vital role in modulating the balance between clearance of pathogenic organisms and tolerance of commensal cells including but not limited to human allografts.

in murine models administration of polymyxin b inhibits e. coli overgrowth and ameliorates gvhd.70 in a study of 112 pediatric patients undergoing hsct total gut decontamination with high-dose nonabsorbable antimicrobials was successful in approximately 50 of children with the degree of decontamination correlating with occurrence and severity of gvhd.74 it should be noted that in addition to antibiotics and probiotics healthy donor fecal transplant may represent a durable therapeutic intervention on the microbiome and transplant-related disease as already demonstrated in infectious human disease.75summaryhuman immune responses are tightly regulated via coordination of myriad cells and signaling molecules and constant exposure to self and foreign antigens.

in this regard the microbiome plays a vital role in cellular crosstalk with numerous cell types and in coordinating immune responses within the host and reciprocally is under constant stimuli from the host be this cells cytokines antibiotics xenobiotics or other.

administration of fcs has been recently reported to induce tolerance in combined kidney- hsc transplant recipients.36the microbiome and its role in host immune regulationit has become increasingly evident over the last decade that the human microbiome participates integrally in eliciting and regulating host immunobiological responses.

these and other techniques are being widely incorporated into microbiome research continue to evolve and are increasingly moving to clinical study applications.another consideration and challenge in studying the human microbiome is the dynamic nature of its constituents and the observation that there are quantitatively scant i.e.

indeed among small intestinal transplant recipients who experienced acute rejection firmicutes and lactobacillales were significantly reduced while proteobacteria were increased in ileal effluents the overall findings suggested that microbiota profiling may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for risk of small intestinal allograft rejection.62the aforementioned findings suggest that monitoring the gut microbiome peritransplantation can provide a potentially useful surrogate marker for outcomes posttransplantation and manipulation of the microbiome may help realize improved outcomes in this regard.hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hscthsct has emerged as a potentially curative therapy for various hematological malignancies as well as nonmalignant diseases.
