Development of an HIV vaccine is even more difficult considering the unparalleled capacity of HIV to mutate its genome allowing it to evade anti- body recognition of its viral envelope  in addition to its ability to suppress the major conductor of the immune response the helper CD4 T-cells .

The ideal HIV vac- cine should provide protection against the broad genetic diversity of HIV control CD4 T-cell activation and likely elicit long-term cytotoxic CD8 T-cell response to block both mucosal and parenteral transmission routes.The humoral immune response is one of the first lines of defense against invading pathogens which plays a cru- cial role in preventing infection.

Measuring these forms of CoP can be labor intensive costly and not scalable highlighting the need to identify surrogate markers that can simply and reliably predict the level of protection from HIV-1 infection.Immune activation as newly identified correlate of protection evidence from yellow feverand hepatitis B commercialized vaccinesRecent information generated from yellow fever and hep- atitis B on CoP will be useful to further guide HIV vac- cine development and implementation.Yellow fever vaccineIn a 2014 study Muyanja and colleagues sought to under- stand the modulation of vaccine immune responses towards better guidance in vaccine development against difficult targets like HIV or malaria .

Among the environmental factors gut microbial composition gut mucosal barrier damage and cytomegalovirus CMV co- infection are the most studied and differ in Northern andSouthern hemispheres .Relevance of immune activation to improve HIV vaccine responseAs noted the encouraging results of the Thai RV144 vaccine trial provided insight into future HIV vaccine development .

In contrast to the clearance of childhood viral infec- tions like smallpox and measles vaccine development against HIV remains challenging as the virus inexora- bly causes a chronic infection that cannot be naturallyCorrespondence re.r3 Division of Hematology McGill University Health Centre Glen Site Research Institute Block E Suite EM 3-3232 Mezzanine 3M 1001 Boulevard Decarie Montreal QC H4A 3J1 CanadaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlecleared by the host.

Furthermore there is little guidance in vaccine design when considering the determinants of host response due to the absence of spontaneous clear- ance of HIV infection.

Very limited information exists on CoP in HIV as vaccine effi- cacy has been globally disappointing.One of the most encouraging vaccine studies RV144 investigated the efficacy of a combined vaccine regimen in young adults in Thailand  .

Such findings in healthy individuals indicate that immune acti- vation prior to vaccination influences the response of one of the most protective vaccines ever commercialized and illustrates the importance of considering immune modu- lation to optimize HIV vaccine response.The importance of immune modulation in vaccine response is supported by a recent study that investigated the impact of infection history in a mouse model.
