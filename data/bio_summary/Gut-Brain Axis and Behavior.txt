However other than a series of case reports on the de- velopment of psychotic symptoms following broad-spectrum antibiotic intake 13 there is limited clinical evidence that acute alterations in the intestinal mi- crobiota have an effect on clinical symptoms reviewed in 3 7.This article will critically review the current preclinical literature about the role of the gut microbiota in behavior explore the current evidence in humans consistent with the preclinical findings and identify translational research areas required to identify a role of the gut microbiota in modulating the brain and the gut-brain axis.Preclinical StudiesA number of experimental approaches have been employed to study the modu- latory effects of gut microbiota on gut-brain interactions in experimental ani- mals including treatment with antibiotics 14 fecal microbial transplant 14- 16 germ-free GF animal models 17 and treatment with probiotics.

Additionally preclinical evidence suggests that the microbiota and its me- tabolites are likely to be involved in modulating behaviors and brain processes including stress responsiveness reviewed in 8 emotional behavior reviewed in 9 pain modulation reviewed in 2 ingestive behavior reviewed in 10 and brain biochemistry reviewed in 11.To date there is limited high-quality evidence regarding alterations in micro- bial ecology or production of microbial-derived metabolic products in human patients with brain or brain-gut disorders.

6 have provided the first evidence suggesting causality by demonstrating that physical impairments in a PD rodent model are enhanced by microbiota from PD but not healthy controls.Summary and Future PerspectivesBased on currently available evidence there is no question that there is a rela- tionship between the composition and function of the gut microbiota and brain function.

Observed dysbiotic states in depression chronic stress and autism may reflect altered brain signaling to the gut while altered gut microbial signaling to the brain may play a role in reinforcing brain alterations.

The majority of human studies have demonstrated associations rather than causality.Plausible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between dramatic results in rodent models and the lack of conclusive evidence for the translatability of these findings into human disease populations include the limited homology of the human and the mouse brain in terms of brain networks relevant for human brain disorders the limitations of the gnotobiotic mouse model and the likeli- hood that brain-gut microbiome interactions in the adult are fairly stable and may have been established largely during the first 3 years of life.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics have well-documented transient effects on the composition and diversity of fecal microbiota 14 even though the effects on mucosa-associated microbial communities are not known.In the studies published since 2010 using different strains of mice and rats different strains of probiotics and different experimental paradigms 11 a range of effects of gut microbial modulation was reported on emotional behav- ior 5 15 16 18-24 learning and memory 22 35 36 social interactions 2430 and ingestive behaviors 27.Emotional BehaviorWhen viewed together reported findings demonstrate an increase in emotional behavior associated with infectioninfestation with pathogens 18-20 a reduc- tion in basal or induced anxiety-like behavior in animals with normal gut micro- biota following the oral administration of probiotics 21-23 25 28 and both reduced 18-20 and increased 36 anxiety in rodents raised in the absence of gut microbiota.

Subsequent randomized double-blind clinical trials are essential to verify the gut microbiota as an effective therapeutic target for ASD maintenance symptoms.Major Depressive DisorderPreclinical studies have demonstrated the capacity of microbiota to influence parameters significant to depression pathogenesis and severity including the levels of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators serotonin reviewed in 39 brain-derived neurotrophic factor 17 18 20 and g-amino butyric acid 22 synaptogenesis and synapse maturation 19.

Converging evidence suggests that the brain and the gut microbiota are in bidirec- tional communication.

Karger AG BaselIntroductionWhile alterations in bidirectional brain-gut microbiota interactions are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of well-known gut disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome IBS and related functional gastrointestinal GI disorders 1such alterations have also been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of several brain disorders including disorders of mood and affect 2 autism spectrum disorders ASD 2 Parkinson disease PD 3 and chronic pain 4.

The observed biochem- ical and behavioral changes could be mediated by a lack of gut microbiota directly or indirectly though one or several of the alterations not related to the brain.Recent evidence suggests that the intrauterine environment is not sterile 31 and one may even speculate that the maternal gut microbial metabolites originat- ing from the maternal gut microbiome may have an influence on fetal brain de- velopment.
