further- more there are considerable gaps in our understanding of the magnitude as well as the sites pathways and molecular mechanisms within the gut-brain axis that are responsible for these alterations even though candidate molecules have re- cently been identified which may play a role in altered social behaviors 5 and in pd 6. the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites have been shown to be involved in modulating gi functions given their ability to affect intestinal per- meability mucosal immune function intestinal motility and sensitivity and re- lease of gi hormones and neurotransmitters from enteroendocrine and entero- chromafin cells 2 as well as activity in the enteric nervous system reviewed in 7. additionally preclinical evidence suggests that the microbiota and its me- tabolites are likely to be involved in modulating behaviors and brain processes including stress responsiveness reviewed in 8 emotional behavior reviewed in 9 pain modulation reviewed in 2 ingestive behavior reviewed in 10 and brain biochemistry reviewed in 11.to date there is limited high-quality evidence regarding alterations in micro- bial ecology or production of microbial-derived metabolic products in human patients with brain or brain-gut disorders.

however other than a series of case reports on the de- velopment of psychotic symptoms following broad-spectrum antibiotic intake 13 there is limited clinical evidence that acute alterations in the intestinal mi- crobiota have an effect on clinical symptoms reviewed in 3 7.this article will critically review the current preclinical literature about the role of the gut microbiota in behavior explore the current evidence in humans consistent with the preclinical findings and identify translational research areas required to identify a role of the gut microbiota in modulating the brain and the gut-brain axis.preclinical studiesa number of experimental approaches have been employed to study the modu- latory effects of gut microbiota on gut-brain interactions in experimental ani- mals including treatment with antibiotics 14 fecal microbial transplant 14- 16 germ-free gf animal models 17 and treatment with probiotics.

6 have provided the first evidence suggesting causality by demonstrating that physical impairments in a pd rodent model are enhanced by microbiota from pd but not healthy controls.summary and future perspectivesbased on currently available evidence there is no question that there is a rela- tionship between the composition and function of the gut microbiota and brain function.

there is a range of differences in brain and gut biochemistry 19 blood-brain barrier permeability 29 hypo- thalamic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis responses 17 metabolic function 26- 28 and affective 5 18-24 social 5 24 30 and ingestive 26-28 behaviors be- tween gf animals and control animals that have normal or pathogen-free flora and who were reared by normally colonized mothers 19 20. the observed biochem- ical and behavioral changes could be mediated by a lack of gut microbiota directly or indirectly though one or several of the alterations not related to the brain.recent evidence suggests that the intrauterine environment is not sterile 31 and one may even speculate that the maternal gut microbial metabolites originat- ing from the maternal gut microbiome may have an influence on fetal brain de- velopment.

finally the recently reported alterations in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in gf mice is likely to result in significantly altered access of gut microbial metabolites to the brain 34. despite the extensive remodeling of biological systems in the gf animal the fact that some observed behaviors and brain changes could be reversed by reconstitution of pathogen-free microbiota conventionalization validates some of the conclusions drawn.

observed dysbiotic states in depression chronic stress and autism may reflect altered brain signaling to the gut while altered gut microbial signaling to the brain may play a role in reinforcing brain alterations.

the majority of human studies have demonstrated associations rather than causality.plausible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between dramatic results in rodent models and the lack of conclusive evidence for the translatability of these findings into human disease populations include the limited homology of the human and the mouse brain in terms of brain networks relevant for human brain disorders the limitations of the gnotobiotic mouse model and the likeli- hood that brain-gut microbiome interactions in the adult are fairly stable and may have been established largely during the first 3 years of life.

for example there is inconclusive ev- idence from human studies regarding the beneficial effects of manipulating the microbiota with prebiotics and antibiotics in patients with ibs even though me- ta-analyses suggest a small therapeutic effect for probiotics reviewed in 12. fur- thermore it is not clear whether alterations observed in the microbiota of patients with these disorders arise from primary alterations at the gut microbial interface bottom-up effects andor changes in brain-gut signaling top-down effects.despite the limited clinical evidence a large and growing number of review articles have appeared in the literature 2 3 extrapolating the preclinical find- ings to human diseases.

broad-spectrum antibiotics have well-documented transient effects on the composition and diversity of fecal microbiota 14 even though the effects on mucosa-associated microbial communities are not known.in the studies published since 2010 using different strains of mice and rats different strains of probiotics and different experimental paradigms 11 a range of effects of gut microbial modulation was reported on emotional behav- ior 5 15 16 18-24 learning and memory 22 35 36 social interactions 2430 and ingestive behaviors 27.emotional behaviorwhen viewed together reported findings demonstrate an increase in emotional behavior associated with infectioninfestation with pathogens 18-20 a reduc- tion in basal or induced anxiety-like behavior in animals with normal gut micro- biota following the oral administration of probiotics 21-23 25 28 and both reduced 18-20 and increased 36 anxiety in rodents raised in the absence of gut microbiota.

a reduction in depression-like behaviors was observed in different rodent models with normal gut microbiota following administration of a probi- otic 22 24. depression-like behavior in these models was induced by maternal separation 23 and experimental myocardial infarction 24.learning and memorywhile improvement in impaired memory function by probiotics was observed in a rodent model of diabetes 35 several studies showed a worsening with ex- posure to a pathogen 36 gf status 19 and administration of a probiotic 22.social and asd-like behaviorgut microbiota status was found to reduce social interactions in gf mice 30 and probiotics improved social interactions in a rat model after myocardial in- farction 24 30. gut microbiota-associated behavioral changes were reported in different asd mouse models including maternal immune activation where treatment with the probiotic bacteroides fragilis had a beneficial effect on some of the behavioral abnormalities 5.ingestive behaviora limited number of studies suggest that gut microbial composition can influ- ence ingestive behavior 26 27. some of these effects are likely mediated by significant alterations in gf animals in intestinal taste receptors fatty acid re- ceptors intestinal transport mechanisms and changes in the release of satiety hormones.in addition to specific behavioral domains effects of gut microbial modula- tion on cns elements with system-wide influence were reported including the hpa axis and signaling systems.hpa axis responsivenessincreased basal or stimulated hpa axis activity measured as blood corticoste- rone or acth levels was reported in gf swiss-webster and balbc mice 18 20 36 while a probiotic-induced reduction in corticosterone levels was ob- served in normal mice 22. the association between increased hpa axis re- sponses and reduced anxiety-like behaviors observed in several of the studies performed in gf mice suggests that hypothalamic hpa axis and nonhypotha- lamic anxiety-like behavior components of central stress circuits may be af- fected differentially by the gf conditions depending on species and mouse strain a response pattern not seen in the majority of existing anxiety models in which these two components of the stress response are generally congruent.

subsequent randomized double-blind clinical trials are essential to verify the gut microbiota as an effective therapeutic target for asd maintenance symptoms.major depressive disorderpreclinical studies have demonstrated the capacity of microbiota to influence parameters significant to depression pathogenesis and severity including the levels of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators serotonin reviewed in 39 brain-derived neurotrophic factor 17 18 20 and g-amino butyric acid 22 synaptogenesis and synapse maturation 19. furthermore mdd-associated gut dysbiosis is corroborated by the abnormal serum immunological parameters of depressed patients.

converging evidence suggests that the brain and the gut microbiota are in bidirec- tional communication.

karger ag baselintroductionwhile alterations in bidirectional brain-gut microbiota interactions are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of well-known gut disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs and related functional gastrointestinal gi disorders 1such alterations have also been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of several brain disorders including disorders of mood and affect 2 autism spectrum disorders asd 2 parkinson disease pd 3 and chronic pain 4. despite the remarkable support for such associations based on behavioral stud- ies in mouse models of these disorders there is limited information regarding the translational relevance of these preclinical data for human diseases.
