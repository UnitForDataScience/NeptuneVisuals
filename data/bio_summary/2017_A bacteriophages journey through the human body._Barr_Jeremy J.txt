The current collective of evidence suggests that the human gut virome is highly personalized consisting of a stable collection of long-term phages that exhibit temperate life- styles.17434953 Gut phages fix and adapt with our microbiome over the course of our life span encoding a rich repertoire of genes that provide functional attributes affecting their bacterial hosts diseases and immune responses.41505154The impact of the bacterial component of the human gut micro- biome on health and well-being is well established.55-58 Research into the genetic potential of gut microbes has led to the concept of a healthy gut microbiome where similar but not identical microbesprovide common functions that promote human health.55 Manrique et al.50 extended this concept to include a healthy gut phageome which is composed of a core and common set of phages shared among healthy individuals that are likely globally distributed.

However the exact mechanisms by which bacteria reach the mammary gland is still contentious with potential mechanisms including contamination from the mother's skin or infant's oral cavity active migration of maternal gut microbes to the mammary gland through endogenous routes and increased gut permeability during pregnancy.219224227228Could the intra-body phageome be vertically transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk and would these phages provide the initial microbial inoculum for the infant's gut Breitbart et al.229 described the first gut virome from a 1-week old infant revealing a viral community with extremely low diversity.

This is partly due to the inherent difficulties associated with the sufficient sampling and sub- sequent molecular identification of low abundance phages within the body.What would this intra-body phageome look like and what is its function To address the first question I assume that intra-body phages primarily originate from the gut which houses the largest aggregation of phages within the body.17180 Within the gut there are an esti- mated 5.09x109 phage per gram of faeces34-36 yielding 2.09x1012 total phage within the colon of an average adult human.6 These gut phages are highly diverse engaged in predatory-prey relationships with their bacterial hosts and have co-evolved with our microbiome over our life span.1843 Next we assume these gut phages are capa- ble of by passing the gut epithelial cell layer and accessing the body through an as yet unidentified mechanism.19146147157 Phages that successfully cross the epithelial cell layer likely enter into the intersti- tial matrix.

Reyes et al.17 provided one of the first detailed metag- enomics analyses of human gut viromes demonstrating remarkable interpersonal diversity within fecal viromes while the intrapersonal viral diversity was very low with 95 of virotypes persisting within the gut of an individual over a 1 year period.

In further stud- ies Minot et al.43 used a deep metagenomics sequencing approach to show that 80 of viral types persisted within the gut of a single individual over a two and a half year period highlighting the long-term viral stability within the human gut.

Weiss et al.65 investigated the in vivo replication of T4 and T7 phages within the gut of mice mono-colonized with a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain showing that T7 phage was capable of significantly higher replication within the gut.

Hsiao et al.236 provided evidence that oral treatment with the commensal Bacteriodes fragilis altered the microbial gut composition corrected gut permeability and subsequently ameliorated behavioral defects in mice.

These dysbiotic gut conditions have been associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disorders IBDs10 and there is a growing interest in the characterization of these microbial signatures with the hopes of using dietary and microbial strategies to mitigate their effects.11-13 Yet the microbial pathogenesis of the gut is a complex affair oft asso- ciated with multiple pathogens and treatment strategies which are further confounded by subsets non-responding individuals.111415 In many cases the etiology of gut diseases and disorders remain unclear.

The first hint of these binding interac- tions came from a report by Minot et al.84 revealing that human gut phage communities encoded hypervariable loci associated with genesencoding immunoglobulin Ig superfamily proteins.

Whether circu- lating intra-body phages are also able to access the placental barrierand subsequently colonize the human fetus prior to birth remains to be addressed.Infants receive copious maternal microbes through birthing and breastfeeding.23215216219220 In early infancy mammalian young almost exclusively consume breast milk as a food source which is in stark contrast to the varied diets consumed post-weaning.220 At its core breast milk is a nutrient delivery system additionally it educates the infant immune system confers a certain degree of protection against intestinal pathogens is a prebiotic and introduces a source of commensal bacteria to the infant gut.219221222 Human breast milk is known to contain diverse populations of bacteria which likely influence the colonization of the infant gut and devel- opment of the immune system.223-225 Ward et al.223 investigated the microbiome of pooled human breast milk identifying a community of over 360 prokaryotic genera that was dominated by the phyla of Proteobacteria 65 and Firmicutes 34.
