the current collective of evidence suggests that the human gut virome is highly personalized consisting of a stable collection of long-term phages that exhibit temperate life- styles.17434953 gut phages fix and adapt with our microbiome over the course of our life span encoding a rich repertoire of genes that provide functional attributes affecting their bacterial hosts diseases and immune responses.41505154the impact of the bacterial component of the human gut micro- biome on health and well-being is well established.55-58 research into the genetic potential of gut microbes has led to the concept of a healthy gut microbiome where similar but not identical microbesprovide common functions that promote human health.55 manrique et al.50 extended this concept to include a healthy gut phageome which is composed of a core and common set of phages shared among healthy individuals that are likely globally distributed.

this is partly due to the inherent difficulties associated with the sufficient sampling and sub- sequent molecular identification of low abundance phages within the body.what would this intra-body phageome look like and what is its function to address the first question i assume that intra-body phages primarily originate from the gut which houses the largest aggregation of phages within the body.17180 within the gut there are an esti- mated 5.09x109 phage per gram of faeces34-36 yielding 2.09x1012 total phage within the colon of an average adult human.6 these gut phages are highly diverse engaged in predatory-prey relationships with their bacterial hosts and have co-evolved with our microbiome over our life span.1843 next we assume these gut phages are capa- ble of by passing the gut epithelial cell layer and accessing the body through an as yet unidentified mechanism.19146147157 phages that successfully cross the epithelial cell layer likely enter into the intersti- tial matrix.

however the exact mechanisms by which bacteria reach the mammary gland is still contentious with potential mechanisms including contamination from the mother's skin or infant's oral cavity active migration of maternal gut microbes to the mammary gland through endogenous routes and increased gut permeability during pregnancy.219224227228could the intra-body phageome be vertically transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk and would these phages provide the initial microbial inoculum for the infant's gut breitbart et al.229 described the first gut virome from a 1-week old infant revealing a viral community with extremely low diversity.

these dysbiotic gut conditions have been associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disorders ibds10 and there is a growing interest in the characterization of these microbial signatures with the hopes of using dietary and microbial strategies to mitigate their effects.11-13 yet the microbial pathogenesis of the gut is a complex affair oft asso- ciated with multiple pathogens and treatment strategies which are further confounded by subsets non-responding individuals.111415 in many cases the etiology of gut diseases and disorders remain unclear.

reyes et al.17 provided one of the first detailed metag- enomics analyses of human gut viromes demonstrating remarkable interpersonal diversity within fecal viromes while the intrapersonal viral diversity was very low with 95 of virotypes persisting within the gut of an individual over a 1 year period.

in further stud- ies minot et al.43 used a deep metagenomics sequencing approach to show that 80 of viral types persisted within the gut of a single individual over a two and a half year period highlighting the long-term viral stability within the human gut.

weiss et al.65 investigated the in vivo replication of t4 and t7 phages within the gut of mice mono-colonized with a non-pathogenic escherichia coli strain showing that t7 phage was capable of significantly higher replication within the gut.

more recently it has been suggested that the microbiota are capable of regulating the nervous system influencing behavioral and neuro- logical functioning.232233 gut microbes use diverse mechanisms to mediate psychoactive effects including fermentation products such as short chain fatty acids that can inhibit neuronal function the direct production of neurotransmitters shedding of microvesicles that can recapitulate effects of the parent bacteria on nervous system and the activation of the vagus nerve which provides a direct neurochemical pathway linking the gut and brain.233-235 bravo et al.235 showed that the lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus had direct effects on neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system cns in mice.

hsiao et al.236 provided evidence that oral treatment with the commensal bacteriodes fragilis altered the microbial gut composition corrected gut permeability and subsequently ameliorated behavioral defects in mice.

gut microbes have coevolved symbiotic relationships with our bodies imparting specific functions associated with nutrient metabolism maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier immunomodulation and protec- tion against pathogens.7-9 in conditions of dysbiosis the composition and function of the microbiota is altered which can result in patho- physiological processes such as inflammation and immune activation.

within the human gut temperate appears to be the preferred phage lifecycle.1743 this is in contrast to aquatic ecosystems where the lytic phage lifecycles dominate with phages following classical kill-the-winner dynamics.4445 the established model in viral ecology predicts that these lytic dynamics dominate at conditions of high host density whereas lysogeny is favored at low host densities.46 in this light the predominance for lysogeny within the gut is surprising when considering that high bacterial density should favor lytic viral dynamics.

this same mechanism is thought to also extend to the viral lytic-lysogeny dynamics within the gut.48 gut phages encode a surprisingly rich repertoire of functional genes that confer beneficial traits to their bacterial hosts which in turn bestow beneficial functions to their metazoan hosts in an intriguing tripartitesymbiosis.344149-52the potential for bacteriophages to influence the structure and function of the gut microbiome is being increasingly recognized and appreciated.

the exponential growth of the mucus adherent phages results in their propagation throughout the surrounding mucus which leads to more productive infections and further reductions in bacterial load.72 thus while the replicative ben- efit for any singular mucus-adherent phage particle is quite small the rapid propagation of these phages provides a dynamic antimicrobial and immunological barrier whose collective effects are propagated throughout the mucosal surface.applying these concepts for the manipulation of bacterial hosts within the gut remains a complicated endeavor.105106 although the human gut is anatomically external to the body it is not easily amena- ble to direct sampling with many studies using fecal samples as a proxy.

many species in the gut are considered to be nutritionally deprived and non-replicating making them poor targets for replicating bacteriophages.39110-113 identifying keystone bacterial species that are physiologically and metabolically active within the mucosal surfaces of the gut represents an important advance.
