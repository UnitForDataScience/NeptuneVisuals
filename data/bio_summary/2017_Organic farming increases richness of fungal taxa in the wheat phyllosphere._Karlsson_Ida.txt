Our study of fungal communities in the wheat phyllosphere thus adds further knowledge on the effects of organic farming on biodiversity.Some previous studies have reported higher numbers of fungal colony-forming units on organically produced fruit than on conven- tionally produced Granado et al.

A similar observation has been made in plant communities where the most abundant species were shared between intensively and extensively managed fields indicating that intensification mainly removes the rarer species rather than completely reshapes the community Kleijn RundloEURf Scheper Smith  Tscharntke 2011.Farmers practising organic production often grow different wheat cultivars than farmers in conventional production as higher disease resistance and nutrient use efficiency are required Lammerts van Bueren et al.

In our study we paired one field in organic production with one field in conventional production growing the same wheat cultivar as plant genotype can affect the phyllosphere microbiota Agler et al.

Little is known about how organic farming affects the phyllo- sphere microbiota of wheat although wheat is grown on a larger proportion of land worldwide than any other crop Food and Agricul- ture Organization of the United Nations 2013.

Species richness esti- mated as the number of OTUs per 10 wheat leaves was higher on wheat leaves from organic production with a mean of 54 - 8.8 SDOTUs compared with 40 - 24.3 SD OTUs for conventional produc- tion Table 3a Figure 3a.

Numerous studies have examined the effect of organic farming on diversity patterns of a number of organism groups and often reported a positive effect on species richness Gasser  Berg 2011 Hole et al.

In the case of Fusarium head blightsome studies have shown that the amount of Fusarium and myco- toxin contamination is lower or equal to in organic cereal production than in conventional production Bernhoft et al.

Pairing of organic and conventional farms or fields is often used to limit varia- tion due to for example climate conditions or soil type Granado et al.

At the start and end of the transect two 0.25 m2 squares were laid out and wheat plants andthe cluster meaning that the distance between two sequences within a cluster can be larger than the cut-off Lindahl et al.
