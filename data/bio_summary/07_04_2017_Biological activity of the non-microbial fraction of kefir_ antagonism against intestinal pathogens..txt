In vitro assays using an intestinal epithelial cell model indicated that pre-incubation of cells with the non-microbial fraction of kefir did not modify the associationinvasion of Salmonella whereas pre-incubation of Salmonella with this fraction under conditions that did notaffect their viability significantly decreased the pathogen's ability to invade epithelial cells.Lactate exerted a protective effect against Salmonella in a mouse model demonstrating the rele- vance of metabolites present in the non-microbial fraction of kefir produced during milk fermentation.Keywords Kefir non-microbial fraction antimicrobial activity antagonism Salmonella.Kefir is a fermented milk sour slightly carbonated with a low alcohol content that is obtained by the fermentation of milk with kefir grains.

enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876 belonging to the American Type Culture Collection ATCC were also used.Antimicrobial activity of the non-microbial fraction of kefirThe antimicrobial activity of the non-microbial fraction of kefir obtained by milk fermentation with CIDCA AGK1 grains at 20 degC during 24 h was studied.

The Institutional Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation CETEAUFMG approved the experiment under agreement number 962011.To evaluate the effects of the oral treatment with kefir non-microbial fraction of kefir and lactate 100 mM on the mortality during an experimental bacterial challenge a total of 60 animals were divided into 4 groups C Control group n  20 mice receiving only sterile water K mice receiving kefir diluted 1  100 in sterile water n  10 NMFK mice receiving the non-microbial fraction of kefir n  10 L mice receiving sodium lactate solution 100 mM n  20.

It should be noted that equivalent results were obtained for the non-microbial fraction obtained with both kefir grains employed which indicatesAntimicrobial activity of non-microbial fraction of kefir343that the fermentation of milk with kefir grains avoids the pro- liferation of pathogenic microorganisms that can act as con- taminants thus contributing to the quality and safety of the product obtained as was also discussed previously by Garrote et al.

It was also observed that the effect of the non-microbial fraction of kefir at acidic pH was bactericidal since no development of colonies was observed in plates seeded after 24 h of incu- bation with the non-microbial fraction in concentration 75 or 100 vv.

In order to detect other antimicrobial compo- nents that could be present at low concentration the acidic and neutralised non-microbial fraction of kefir was concen- trated 5-fold by lyophilisation and the growthsurvival of pathogens was analysed by counting viable microorganisms inoculated in the concentrated non-microbial fraction of kefir .

The non- microbial fraction of kefir obtained by fermentation of milk with CIDCA AGK1 grains at 20 degC during 24 h was analysed and two experimental designs which evaluate the effect of either the Salmonella- or cells-preincubation with non-microbial fraction of kefir were applied.

Subsequently the development of pathogens was evaluated in the non-microbial fraction of kefir pH 38 and in the same fraction neutralised .

Enteritidis were observed indicating that the components present in the non-microbial fraction did not produce changes on the cells that might modify the interaction with the pathogen.The in vivo effect of neutralised kefir and non-bacterial fraction of kefir were analysed in a murine model of Salmonella infection.
