VB is brined either in a brine bath or by dry salting surface treatment and no other treatment such as the addition of external ri- pening cultures is applied during ripening which last from three to up to 18 months.In a previous study the bacterial and fungal composition of the rind microbiota of VB was assessed by using 16S and 18S rRNA cloning and Sanger sequencing revealing a high diversity on VB cheese rinds with Gram-negative bacteria being particularly abundant  .

Shannon and Chao1 diversity indices showed higher diversity in environmental surfaces from the short-ripening cellar A2 than from the long-ripening cellar A3 overall while long-ripened VB rinds were more diverse than short-ripened VB rinds Table S1.Analysis of the microbial community composition of the cellars and cheese rindsOverall four different phyla Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were identified.

Psychroflexus was found in environmental surfaces in this study and on cheese rinds in other recent studies  .No external surface ripening cultures are added during VB produc- tion supporting the formation of an indigenous highly stable house microbiota on VB rinds.

Analysis of OTUs shared between different surfaces suggests that VB rind bacteria are inoculated naturally during the ripening from the processing en- vironment and that cheese surfaces exert selective pressure on these communities as only those bacteria better adapted flourished on VB rinds.

This study analyzed VB processing environment microbiota and its relationship with VB rinds for the first time elucidating that the processing environment and the cheese microbiota should be considered as microbiologically linked ecosystems with the goal of better defining the events that take place during cheese maturation.IntroductionCheese is one of the oldest fermented foods.

B evidenced that despite the different rind washing conditions that are applied to VB in each cellar the microbial composition of VB rinds is similar.Taxonomic assignments of the 50 most abundant OTUs are shown inTable S2 and the relative abundance of the 25 most abundant OTUsFig.

VB rinds represent a se- lective environment as only certain bacterial groups such asBrevibacterium S. equorum H. boliviensis Corynebacterium Leucobacterand Sphingobacterium seem to be able to flourish although their abundance in short- and long-ripened VB varied.

Sphingobacterium was found mainly on long- ripened VB rinds and has been associated with raw milk microbiota and cheese rinds although its functions in cheese ripening are still unknown  .

This study shows for the first time the relationship between cheese rinds and facility-specific microbiota from Austrian Vorarlberger Bergkase and the importance of non-inoculated autochthonous micro- biota dominating VB rinds.

Cellar A2 contains VB from 0 to 4 months ripening time short-ripening cellar cellar A3 contains VB aged from 4 to 18 months long-ripening cellar.
