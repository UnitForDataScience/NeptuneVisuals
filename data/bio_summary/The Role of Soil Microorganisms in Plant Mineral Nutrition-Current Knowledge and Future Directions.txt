regarding cultivation artificial plant growth systems cannot mirror the natural conditions in soil but on the other hand it is difficult to unravel the relevant communication signals occurring in soil due to chemical interaction of metabolites with the soil matrix and background metabolites released from decomposing organic matter or microbial exudation.

these genes are thus positioned as potential targets for improving the microbial provision of plant-bioavailable n p and s. however the sheer complexity of the soil microbiome makes it difficult to draw mechanistic links between specific genes and ecosystem processes which is one of the reasons why many researchers are adopting syncom experiments that attempt to re-construct a simplified rhizosphere microbiome in a controlled setting  .in the soil biology literature enzyme assays have established a set of enzymes linked to high-functioning soil microbiota such as protease urease various phosphatases and sulfatase    .

so even if the soil microbiota contains strains with genes encoding the aforementioned enzymes linked to soil health soil conditions must be optimized for these microbial proteins to be expressed and active  .
