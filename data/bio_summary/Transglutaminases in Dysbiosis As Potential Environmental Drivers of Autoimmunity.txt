This results in the leaky gut allowing more immunogenic foreign molecules to enter systemic circulation and induce strong immune responses including celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases  .In the light of the close functionality between the human and microbial Tgs and the involvement of the former in disease it is possible to suggest the potential involvement of latter in human disease as well.

Inhibition of this activity by RNAi leads to the overproduction of antimicrobial peptides in the gut to the changes in the composition of gut microbiota and subsequently to the reduced life span of flies.Representatives of all three domains of life possess aquantities of mTgs produced in the gut.

These may represent an additional substantial source of mTgs entering the gut lumen.The consequences of elevated concentrations of mTgs are not clear but the Tg activities in general have been linked to fibrosis Huntington's disease celiac disease and cancer.

In this hypothesis the endogenous mTgs that are secreted by the gut microbiota especially in a dysbiotic configuration are potential drivers of systemic autoimmunity via the enzymatic posttranslational modification of peptides in the gut lumen.

Anti-tTg antibodies are frequently detected in celiac disease and they are implicated in the small intestine damage in this disease     .Microbial transglutaminases are extracellular enzymes  .

These protective structures synthesized by microorganisms using mTg therefore may contribute to a better survival of microorganisms in hostile environments including the gut with the excretion into the gut lumen of bile acids digestive enzymes antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulins  .

Interestingly a new application for mTg crosslinking have been proposed that can be used as a new probiotic carrier for the enhanced gastrointestinal transit and storage  .What could be the potential effects of the endogenous and exogenous mTgs present in the gut milieu These potentials are briefly discussed in the next section.mTg AND INTESTINAL PTMPIn celiac disease the autoantigen is tTg which is capable of deamidating or transamidating gliadin    .

Moreover the same food additive has been suggested as a new environmental trigger and potential inducer of celiac disease  .The prominent features of the mTgs encompass the multitude of functions and properties which may contribute to the potential PTMP capabilities in the human gut lumenmTgs display a limited specificity toward the natural and non-natural acyl-acceptor substrates which broadens the range of modifications involving the Gln-containing peptides and proteins  .

Based on all the evidences presented mTgs may contribute to the induction development and perpetuation of the autoimmune processes.THE HYPOTHESIS mTg IS A POTENTIAL DRIVER OF SYSTEMIC AUTOIMMUNITYWe hypothesize here that the endogenous mTgs secreted by the gut microbiota especially in a dysbiotic configuration FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio is a potential driver of systemic autoimmunity via the gut luminal PTMP.

All these capacities may contribute to the increase in the intestinal permeability thus potentiating immune and autoimmune responses.SUMMARYIt is hypothesized here that the mTgs produced by the gut microbiota especially in the dysbiotic configuration are thepotential drivers of systemic autoimmunity via the PTMP activities in the gut lumen.
