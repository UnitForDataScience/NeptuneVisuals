The column was Pico tag 3.9 x 150 mm I.D.

The sample was hydrolysed in 1 M H2SO4 at 100degC for 3 hr and diluted 10 times.

The diluted samples were passed through a 0.45-mm filter and injected to a high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection HPAEC-PAD Dionex-5500 Dionex Corporation Canada.

The column system was cleaned after each analysis with 300 mM NaOH for 30 min.

The instrument was controlled and data were processed using Dionex AI 450 software Dionex Corporation Canada.

The amount of total sugar was the sum of monosaccharides in PO mucilage.

The birds in each pen replicate had free access to feed and water during the experimental period.

The environmental conditions of experimental house were kept at 32 - 1.5oC with 60 - 5 humidity at the first week and then the temperature was gradually decreased by 3oC each week.

The length of small intestine and relative weight of different sections e.g.

The processing consisted of serial dehydration clearing Tissue Processor Shandon Duplex USA and impregnation with wax.
