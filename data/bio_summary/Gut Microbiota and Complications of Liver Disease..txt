TheAcharya and BajajPage 7CDR similar to SIBO has a direct relationship with the severity of liver disease and interestingly alcoholic cirrhosis has been noted to have the lowest CDR14.In understanding the role of BA's in cirrhosis Kakiyama et al showed an increase in BA's in the serum of cirrhotics NASH related and Alcoholic and that there was a reduced quantity of BAs entering the intestine from the liver as the severity of liver disease progressed.

To further aseess the interplay Tetri et al in a multicenter randomized trial studied the effect of obeticholic acid BA derivative that activates FXR in NASH patients and noted improvement in the histological features of NASH based on the NAFLD activity score on liver biopsies56..Alcoholic liver diseaseALD spans the spectrum of CLD from steatosis steatohepatitis liver fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis to more acute manifestations like acute alcoholic hepatitis.

BA's are thought to regulate the microbiome by a potential detergent effect on the cell walls of the intestinal microbacteria49 and also by interacting with the Farnesoid X receptor FXR in the liver which not only induces excretion of BA's from the liver but also induces antimicrobial peptides production5051.The conjugated forms of primary acids BA's cholic acid CA and chenodeoxycholic acidCDCA have been found to be higher in the serum of NAFLD patients52 and similarly the conjugated form of primary and secondary BA's lithocolic LCA and deoxycholic acid DCA were noted to be 2.4 times higher in patients with NASH compared to controls53.Lake et al studied the composition of BA's in the human livers of NAFLD patients and interestingly found a reduced level of CA and glycodeoxycholic acid and an increase in taurocholic acid and taurodeoxycholic acid54.

Altered gut microbiota plays an important role in cirrhosis and its modulation to prevent disease progression changes and concomitantly bile acid physiology must be regulated or augmented to help prevent cirrhosis and its complications.KeywordsCirrhosis Bile acids Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Alcoholic Liver Disease Dysbiosis Microbiome Firmicutes BacteroidetesINTRODUCTIONOur fundamental understanding of liver disease especially cirrhosis and its complications has changes dramatically over the last decade with the introduction of the culture- independent microbiome analysis.

This review focuses primarily on human Non- alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLDNon-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis NASH related liver disease alcohol related liver disease ALD as these etiologies are the paradigms for microbiome-related endotoxemia dysbiosis and related changes in the liver.

The onset of cirrhosis regardless of etiology results in changes to the microbiome which is furthered by decompensation.NAFLDNAFLD and its more sinister evolution NASH is slated to be the most common cause for chronic liver disease CLD and liver transplantation in the near future19.

To understand why certain patients remain stable while others decompensate despite control of inciting insults investigators have evaluated the gut microbiome and its associated changes in various stages and etiologies of liver disease to further explain this phenomenon.The intestinal microbiome itself is a complex composition of microorganisms that is well known to be implicated in cirrhosis and its complications 9.

The microbiome changes post cirrhosis in ALD are similar to that seen in any other etiology for cirrhosis excepting that as cirrhosis onsets the ratio of Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes changes with the former reducing.

Mutlu et al studied chronic alcoholics with no cirrhosis and in colonic microbiome analysis found dysbiosis with a relative lower median abundance of Bacteroidetes and higher abundance of Proteobacteria71.

Further studies regarding alcoholics and BA variation with the microbiome areneeded.Post-Cirrhosis microbiome changes--Once cirrhosis has set in the microbiome changes are often due to other mechanisms playing a larger role in promoting dysbiosis.
