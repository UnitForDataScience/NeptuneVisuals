therefore these strains are suitable for the efficient environmentally safe and rapid bioremediation of glyphosate-contaminated soils.the aim of this work was to study the physiological properties of pn-degrading bacterial strains and to discuss their possible interactions in the natural consortium of gp- polluted soil.materials and methodsisolation of pn-degrading strains their identification and storageochrobactrum anthropi gpk 3 vkm v-2554 d achro- mobacter sp.
