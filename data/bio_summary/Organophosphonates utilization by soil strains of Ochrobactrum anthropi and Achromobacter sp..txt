Introduc- tion of degrading strains Achromobacter sp.

Therefore these strains are suitable for the efficient environmentally safe and rapid bioremediation of glyphosate-contaminated soils.The aim of this work was to study the physiological properties of Pn-degrading bacterial strains and to discuss their possible interactions in the natural consortium of GP- polluted soil.Materials and methodsIsolation of Pn-degrading strains their identification and storageOchrobactrum anthropi GPK 3 VKM V-2554 D Achro- mobacter sp.
