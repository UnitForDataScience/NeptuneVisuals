The term ''core mi- crobiome'' was introduced by the Human Microbiome Project to identify bacterial consortia that are present in the majority of the study population implying that these species are best adapted to that particular microenvironment.36 The authors of the present study defined the core microbiome as that which is found in 75 of individuals this is a far more conservative definition than the one previously used microbiome found in 50 of individuals by other investigations.63738 This ensured that in the present study the included species were truly rep- resentative of the furcation microbiome.

This finding has important clinical implications especially for studies that examine the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies on selected bacterial species for example red complex bacteria data from the present study in- dicate that these species are not universally present in all diseased furcations.Previous in vitro investigations have suggested that EMD may have antimicrobial properties.1920 Therefore in the present study it was hypothesized that significant microbial shifts would be observed in EMD-treated groups EMD alone and BONEEMD compared with the non-EMD group.

When data from the present study were reanalyzed to in- clude species found in 50 of individuals data not shown 35 species associated with furcations were found which is still significantly lower than the number found in interproximal lesions.

Interestingly no red-complex species were found in any lesion.Figure 3 shows the fold change in levels of species that demonstrated statistically significant differences with time in each group.

This result corroborates previous in vitro studies showing a possible antimicrobial effect of EMD reducing the amounts of P. gingivalis A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. intermedia.41Data from the present study suggest that EMD is capable of reducing the abundance of Filifactor alocis a species that was part of the core furcation micro- biome at baseline Fig.

Several ap- proaches have been used to achieve this including both surgical and non- surgical techniques.910 Recent reviews have demonstrated that regenerative ap- proaches provide stable long-term out- comes in furcation defects.11-13Periodontal regeneration may beachieved through use of barrier membrane graft placement and biologic modulators either singly or in combination.1214 Enameldoi 10.1902jop.2017.160542matrix derivative EMD has been shown to result in formation of new periodontal ligament and alveolar bone.15-18 There is some evidence from in vitro studies that EMD also possesses an antimicrobial effect which may directly influence vitality of plaque bacteria andor inhibit further growth of bacte- ria.1920 However very little is known about the mi- crobial community associated with furcation lesions and even less about any possible antimicrobial effect of EMD or other regenerative therapies in a clinical environment.Therefore the purpose of the present study is to investigate responses of the subgingival microbiome to three different approaches for treatment of buccal Class II furcation defects using high-throughput sequencing and computational bioinformatics for bacterial com- munity characterization.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy DesignThe present study was designed to examine responses of the microbial communities of buccal mandibular Class II furcation defects to treatment with EMD alone or in combination with a bone substitute graft made of beta tricalcium phosphatehydroxyapatite b-TCP HA.

Clinical parameters related to the study groups are reported in a previous publication.21 The Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas Piracicaba Brazil approved the study design protocol number 0352007.

Sequencing procedures have been previously described.26 High-quality classifiable sequences quality score 25 200 base-pair length were clus- tered into species-level operational taxonomic units s-OTUs at 97 sequence similarity and assigned a taxonomic identity by alignment to the Human Oral Microbiome Database HOMD27 using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool-nucleotide BLASTn algorithm.Analyses were conducted using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology pipeline28 as well as an analysis pipeline developed internally by the authors.29 Results were visualized with the Python library matplotlib30 as well as open source programs for statistical analysis and data visualization R project31 and Interactive Tree of Life.32 A core microbiome was computed based on species that were found in 75 of individuals.RESULTSMicrobial samples were not obtainable from two patients one from the BONEEMD group and one from the BONE group.

Together these species comprised 50 of the total abundance.

All treatments were capable of changing the subgingival microbiome with re- ductions in several pathogens and increases in health-compatible species P 0.05 repeated measures analysis of variance.
