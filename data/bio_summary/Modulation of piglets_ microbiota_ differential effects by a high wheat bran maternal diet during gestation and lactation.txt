SCFA production in piglets' intestinal contents was measured and differences between groups were observed.In the caecum and colon acetate was higher for WB piglets compared to CON animals whereas valerate was lower for WB piglets for each intestinal part.

It is particularly true for piglets for which colonization by microbiota has been demonstrated to be affected by stressbut may apply to sows as farrowing and lactation are stressful periods due to handlings on sows and piglets and accompanied with physiological changes.

the discrepancy between microbiota changes in sows and piglets can be ascribed to the use of faeces for sows and colon content for piglets which may not be the exact reflection of a sow's colon.

Less butyrate was produced in the caecum of WB piglets and a lower concentration of valerate was observed in all intestinal parts of WB piglets.

email and activated T cells by using prebiotics but few focussed on the direct impact of sows' diet on the offspring's microbiota .Wheat bran WB is a source of insoluble non-starch polysaccharides rich in arabinoxylans cellulose and lignin that is commonly used in sows' diets for its bulking properties and may be considered as a prebiotic due to its ability to be fermented in the large intestine-.

Fourteen blood and meconium samples were collected in total 6 from CON sows 8 from WB sows.

Distribution of alpha diversity as measured by Shannon index box plots represent the calculated Shannon index for microbiota samples of sows fed the control diet CON N  6 and the wheat bran-enriched diet WB N 6 at three different stages 21 d G21 and 98 d G98 of gestation respectively before and after the experimental diets were distributed and 20 d of lactation L.The SCFA molar ratios of the sows' faeces see Supplementary Table  were not affected by the dietary treatment whatever the period while a period-effect was observed p 0.001 for the total SCFA concentration.

Individual WB sows are displayed in red and CON sows in blue.Umbilical cord blood and meconium.

Negative correlations are expressed in the table with the symbol -.that is directly ingested by the foetus in the second part of the gestationcould be interesting in the future as well as placenta during C-section.Regarding the main hypothesis in this experiment namely the introduction of WB into sows' diet and the impact on their microbiota it was shown that during gestation 13 genera abundances differed in sows' faeces between both dietary groups and 2 additional genera differed during lactation.

As it has been shown that WB can induce microbiota and SCFA changes in growing pigs' ileum and faeces WB in the maternal diet was used in this study to investigate whether an altered microbiota was observed in sows' faeces at different time points and if this treatment could in turn affect the microbiota and SCFA production of their offspring.
