Addition of NAC in miR-22 transfected cells resulted in increased bcl2 expres- sion 2.8 fold and decreased expression of cytochrome c cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 3.37 4.7 and 6.1 fold respectively compared to miR-22 transfected cells A.To study whether the butyrate-mediated effects are through miR- 22 the cells were transfected with anti-miR-22 oligos followed by butyrate incubation.

The cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA USA and the cells were counted in at least 10 different high power fields and the percent of apoptosis induction was calculated.Annexin V-PI assayHuh 7 cells 2x105 cellswell were incubated with butyrate alone or butyrate and N-acetyl cysteine or butyrate and anti-miR-22 oligos for 24 h. After incubation the cells were detached using 0.05 trypsin from the plates washed and incubated with Annexin V-conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC and propidium iodide for 30 min.

In our study inhibition of SIRT-1 expression by butyrate alone or miR-22 alone resulted in increased ROS production altered psm and enhanced apoptosis while upon addition of either NAC or anti-miR-22 reversed these butyrate-mediated effects.It was found that down-regulation of SIRT-1 by miR-22 or butyrateresulted in the inhibition of bcl2 expression while increasing the expression of cytochrome c caspase 9 and caspase 3 thereby inducing apoptosis.

E The target sequence of the miR-22 was positioned at 530-537 of 3' UTR region of SIRT-1.Butyrate Inhibits SIRT-1 expression via miR-22Incubation of Huh 7 cells with butyrate inhibited the SIRT-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner 1-5 mM and inhibition at 5 mM concentration was most significant 73 inhibition A.

The data showed that the addition of butyrate or miR-22 decreased the cell proliferation to 60.6 and 68.7 respectively and addition of anti- miR-22 along with butyrate reversed the proliferation back to the normal levels D.Butyrate inhibits super oxide dismutaseSIRT-1 is known to regulate the SOD gene expression in order to quench the ROS production in the cells .

While butyrate inhibited 93 decrease SIRT-1 expression co-incubation of anti-miR-22 with butyrate reversed SIRT- 1 expression D. The miR-22 was found to be a direct target for SIRT-1 gene at 3' UTR positioned at 530-537 E.Butyrate induces ROS productionSIRT-1 was shown to inhibit the ROS generation via regulating the expression of the cellular antioxidant genes.

n3 p  0.05.was inhibited by co-incubating with either NAC or anti-miR-22 D. To confirm these findings a TUNEL assay was performed and found that butyrate treated cells showed increased percentage of the TUNEL positive cells 79.1 while addition of either NAC or anti- miR-22 inhibited the butyrate-induced cell death 28.3  38.4 respectively E and F.Butyrate inhibits cell proliferationFurther to determine the effects of the butyrate on cell proliferation the key proteins involved in the cancer cell growth was estimated by Western blotting.

In the present study we demonstrated that butyrate induces apoptosis through up-regulation of miR-22 followed by the downregulation of SIRT-1 resulting in increased ROS production and apoptosis in hepatic cells.Materials and methodsCell culture butyrate treatment and miRNA transfectionHuh 7 cells 1x105 cellswell were cultured in 6-well plates containing DMEM medium with 10 FBS and 1 penicillin-strepto- mycin for 24 h. The cells were incubated with varying concentrations 0-8 mM of sodium butyrate for 24 h under serum-free conditions.

The percent of ROS production was calculated by counting in at least 10 different high power fields averaged and the results were presented.Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potentialThe cells 4x105 cellswell were incubated with butyrate alone or miR-22 alone or butyrate and anti-miR-22 together for 24 h. The cells were fixed by 4 paraformaldehyde washed and 100 nM DiOC6 was incubated for 15 min in dark as described previously .

The results showed that incubation of cells with either butyrate alone or miR-22 alone showed increased green colour compared to control while addition of anti-miR-22 with butyrate did not result significant change in m compared to control .Butyrate induces ROS-mediated intrinsic apoptosisROS is known to induce apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway in various cancer cells.
