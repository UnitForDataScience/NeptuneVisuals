The use of specific controlled reforestation practices   aids in the creation of replicated sites over time with relatively well-controlled ecosystem development in terms of soil properties land- scapes and vegetation .In this study we characterized both the intra-annual variability and long-term recovery in bacterial and fungal components of soil microbiota in a chronosequence of reclaimed mine lands that spans 5 to 30 years postreforestation and includes unmined reference plots.

The rapid responses of microorganisms to alterations in environmental conditions and their high turnover rates may provide additional information and possibly an early indication of the restoration progress following ecosystem disturbance .Both bacteria and fungi are significant components of the soil microbiota and perform critical ecological functions but they also have many differences in phenotype phylogeny and life history that could cause different succession patterns during recovery.

For example typical soil fungal growth rates appear to be about 10-fold lower than those of soil bacteria and fungi tend to be more tolerant of low temperatures and dry soils  .

The dendrograms to the left of the heatmaps represent clustering of microbial taxa based upon similar patterns of variation.experimentation would be required to determine which might be directly driving or resulting from changes in soil microbiota.The dominant bacterial phyla and proteobacterial classes across all samples were Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria respectively representing 21.5 and 18.0 of all sequences assigned to the domain Bacteria .

For example soil fungal biomass turnover times have been estimated to be 100 days which is about 10-fold slower than those of typical soil bacteria  .

The significantly higher- than-average numbers of overlaps in both bacterial OTUs and cooccurrences indicate that a portion of the bacterial interaction network persists over relatively long periods of time during the recovery of soil microbiota.

Three soil samples were taken from 0 to 10 cm depth in each plot pooled and homogenized to more fully capture the diversity at the plot level while using the replicated plots to characterize variation in the soil microbiota at each site.
