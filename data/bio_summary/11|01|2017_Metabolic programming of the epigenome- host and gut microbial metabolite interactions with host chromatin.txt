metabolic programming of the epigenome host and gut microbial metabolite interactions with host chromatinkimberly a. krautkramer rashpal s. dhillon john m. denu and hannah v. careymadison wisthe mammalian gut microbiota has been linked to host developmental immuno- logic and metabolic outcomes.

here we discuss evidence for gut microbial regula- tion of the host epigenetic machinery via de novo synthesis cometabolism of dietary and host intermedi- ates direct competition with the host for dietary nutrients and conversion of dietary substrates to bioac-tive compounds.organic acids.

importantly if antimicrobials are given later in the animal's life the effects on growth are less than if the exposure occurred in early life and a study of germ- free chickens showed loss of the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics in the absence of a gut micro- biota.similar effects have been reported in murine models where exposure to subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics either from birth or early inlife altered gut microbial community composition and increased host adiposity and susceptibility to metabolic disease.further these effects were synergistic when coupled with high fat feeding and the metabolic impacts on the host persisted even after microbial communities have recovered suggesting metabolic reprogramming occurs in response to early life exposure to antibiotics.

fungi and vi- ruses are also detectable within the host gut microbiome however data regarding the regulation of host physiology by these organisms are scarce and there is no evidence to our knowledge of commensal fungiand viruses directly impacting host epigenetic programming.

below we highlight known relationships between gut microbial metabolites and host chromatin in the setting of host health and disease.innate and adaptive immunity.

environmental exposures that occur early in life particularly during key developmental windows for the host and its gut microbiota can have lasting impacts on host chromatin and microbial commu-nities.

while it remains unclear how early life factors and microbiota-host chromatin communication may be involved in this setting it suggests the possibility that diet-microbiota interactions may program host chro- matin responses across generations.antibiotics represent an extremely prevalent early life exposure that can affect both host and microbial com- munity development and metabolic outcomes.
