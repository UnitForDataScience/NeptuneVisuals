Recent advancements in amplification and next- generation sequencing NGS techniques in particular applied to the bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA encoding genes 16S rRNA genes have overcome this problem are increas- ingly used in the clinical microbiology lab  and have enormously expanded our knowl- edge of microbiome composition .However it is still difficult to use the composition of the human gut microbiota as a clinical tool in the diagnosis of chronic health conditions.

Therefore most studies comparing microbiomes from healthy controls and diseased patients might be too small to detect small but real differences in gut microbiotas.In this study we present an NGS-based clinical gut microbiome sequencing assay to assess the relative abundance of health condition-associated microorganisms .

Defining the healthy ranges for gut microbes with known clinical relevance as done in this study is likely to bring the analysis of the composition of the gut microbiome one step closer to being part of routine health care analysis -.

Here we present the targeted sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene of clinically relevant gut microorganisms as a method to provide a gut screening test that could assist in the clinical diagnosis of certain health conditions.

2017 16S rRNA gene sequencing and healthy reference ranges for 28 clinically relevant microbial taxa from the human gut microbiome.

Raw FASTQ reads mapping to the samples and the taxa in the reference databases used in this study were uploaded to EBI's ENA under accessionAbstractChanges in the relative abundances of many intestinal microorganisms both those that nat- urally occur in the human gut microbiome and those that are considered pathogens have been associated with a range of diseases.

All of the 28 taxa on the test have been associated with human health in the gut microbiome.

All of the 28 taxa on the test have been associated with human health in the gut microbiome.

Verification samples were processed in uBiome microbiome sampling kits using the clinical pipeline described above.Results and discussionClinically relevant target identificationTo derive a preliminary target list of bacteria and archaea to include in our assay we first iden- tified clinically relevant microorganisms present in the human microbiome.

We evaluated the possibility of detecting 46 clinical prokaryotic targets in the human gut 28 of which could be identified with high precision and sensitivity by a bioinformatics pipeline that includes sequence analysis and taxonomic anno- tation.
