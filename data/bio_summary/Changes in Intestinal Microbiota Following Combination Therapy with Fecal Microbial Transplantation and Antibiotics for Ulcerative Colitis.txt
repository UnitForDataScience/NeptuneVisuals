Evaluation of factors correlated with clinical response revealed that sex age Mayo score at baseline disease extent and ongoing treatment did not affect clinical responses in both groups however the endoscopic sum score was associated with clinical responses in this patient population n 14 3 P 0.04 in combination therapy with AFM and FMT data not shown.120  16S rDNA-Based Microbiome AnalysisFrom DNA libraries of 16S rDNA PCR products we obtained an average of 505095 534657 592379 and 572602 reads per sample in four groups n 17 specimens per group healthy donors patients with UC before therapy patients with UC after 2 weeks of AFM pretreatment and patients with UC at 4 weeks after FMT therapy respectively see Table S1 Supplemen- tal Digital Content 1 We also obtained an average of 252293 190038 219467 and 281449 reads per sample in four groups patients with UC before therapy patients with UC after a 2-week AFM course and patients with UC at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after AFM therapy respectively see Table S2 Supplemental Digital Content 2 IBDB395 n 16 specimens at 8 weeks posttreatment in the AFM monotherapy group otherwise n 19 specimens per group.

Thus this therapeutic protocol may be useful for managing UC.Inflamm Bowel Dis 201723116-125Key Words fecal microbiota transplantation fresh FMT ulcerative colitis bacteroidetes AFM therapynflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis UC are highly prevalent lifelong chronic disorders caused by complex interactions between genetic immunological and environmental factors.1 Patients with UC have a decreased diversity and richness in their intes- tinal microbiota resulting in dysbiosis.23 It remains unclear whether dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is a cause or conse- quence of UC and further studies are needed to clarify thisrelationship.Supplemental digital content is available for this article.

This clinical study included 21 patients with UC who were enrolled in the combination-therapy group AFM pretreatment and FMT between July 2014 and June 2015 and 20 patients with UC who were enrolled in the AFM monotherapygroup between August 2015 and March 2016.

Comparison of the Baseline Characteristics of Patients Who Received AFM Monotherapy or Combination Therapy with AFM and FMTAFMMonotherapyAFM  FMT n 14 19n 14 17P treatment to 0.3 6 0.5 after 2 weeks of AFM pretreatment P 0.0001 and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria increased significantly from 9.1 6 11.7 in patients with UC before treatment to 78.6 6 20.2 in patients with UC after 2 weeks of AFM pretreatment P  0.001.

Furthermore AFM therapy aids in the understanding of changes occurring in the intestinal micro- biota during FMT.Many previous findings have demonstrated a relationship between dysbiotic intestinal microbiota and UC and various bacterial taxa Roseburia Fusobacterium and Odoribacter gen- era furthermore altered compositions reduced microbial rich- ness a decrease in Firmicutes a decrease in Bacteroidetes and an increase in Proteobacteria relevant to UC have been proposed.23-26 However variations in gut microbiota between individuals limitations in classification technology based onFIGURE 5.

ORIGINAL ARTICLEChanges in Intestinal Microbiota Following Combination Therapy with Fecal Microbial Transplantation and Antibiotics for Ulcerative ColitisDai Ishikawa MD PhD Takashi Sasaki PhD Taro Osada MD PhD Kyoko Kuwahara-Arai PhD Keiichi Haga MD PhD Tomoyoshi Shibuya MD PhD Keiichi Hiramatsu MD PhDand Sumio Watanabe MD PhDBackground Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT is a potential therapeutic approach to restore normal intestinal microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis UC which is associated with dysbiosis however treatment efficacy remains unclear.

Microbiome analysis was performed by 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing.Results Patients with mild-to-severe active UC combination-therapy group n 14 21 AFM monotherapy group n 14 20 were included.

The recovery rate of Bacteroidetes at 4 weeks after FMT correlated with endoscopic severity.Conclusions FMT following antimicrobial bowel cleansing synergistically contributes to the recovery of the Bacteroidetes composition which is associated with clinical response and UC severity.

DOI 10.1097MIB.0000000000000975Published online 28 November 2016.Recently fecal microbiota transplantation FMT which is a therapeutic approach for restoring normal functions in the intestinal microbiota by transplanting bacterial flora among feces derived from a healthy donor45 has been evaluated in the context of treating patients with UC.

The therapeutic potential of FMT for treating various diseases has been extensively investigated in recent years.6 The high efficacy of FMT in therapy-refractory recurrent Clostridium difficile infection an intestinal disease also linked to dysbiosis was demonstrated by Von Nood et al.7 How- ever the efficacy of FMT treatment in patients with UC remains controversial.
