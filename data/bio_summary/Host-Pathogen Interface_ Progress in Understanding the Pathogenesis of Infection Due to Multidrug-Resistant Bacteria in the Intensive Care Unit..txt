Reducing healthcare-associated infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-related blood- stream infection has become a major objective for hospital regulatory organizations to improve patient outcome and re- duce the financial burden -.

It is perhaps the best-studied airway pathogen in part because of its association with airway infection in cystic fibrosis and the con- certed research effort to understand the pathogenesis of pulmo- nary infection associated with CFTR mutations 4.

The Journal of Infectious Diseases SUPPLEMEN T ARTICL EHost-Pathogen Interface Progress in Understanding the Pathogenesis of Infection Due to Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria in the Intensive Care UnitDanielle Ahn and Alice PrinceDepartment of Pediatrics Columbia University Medical Center New YorkThe diverse responses of critically ill patients to infection with multi-drug resistant MDR bacteria are determined by many complex factors.

These advances have provided insights into the molecular ep- idemiology of clusters of infection in ICUs and have helped dissect the molecular features of the most highly successful pathogens  .There is increasing appreciation of the remarkable heteroge- neity of the pathogens that infect ICU patients as well as funda- mental differences in the quality of the hosts that they infect .

Substantial data document the multiple factors that influence this host response to infection such as host genetics alterations in the microbiome and vari- ous mechanisms of host immunosuppression  .

Strategies to prevent biofilm formation by changing the material of foreign bodies such as endotracheal tubes are an avid area of study  .Some organisms such as the small colony variants of S. au- reus adopt a low metabolic profile replicating intracellularly at a reduced rate but providing a nidus for recurrent and dissem- inated infection .

Moreover mixed populations of the same spe- cies of bacteria with varying antimicrobial susceptibility and replication rates heterogeneous phenotype may be selected out during the course of infection .MULTIPLE MECHANISMS OF PATHOGEN-HOST ACTIVATIONThe pathogenesis of most lower respiratory tract infections in the ICU is through aspiration of upper airway flora presumably planktonic organisms released from biofilms associated with endotracheal tubes or aspiration of the upper airway microbiota after loss of airway reflexes  .

Furthermore bacterial production of pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide enables stimulation of both superfi- cial and cytoplasmic receptors to initiate host signaling.Bacterial targeting of specific components of innate immuni- ty has a major impact on the pathogenesis of infection with complex and often redundant signaling pathways for immune cellular recruitment.

T cells in the airway are also readily activated by bacterial components in addition to superantigens contributing to the inflammatory damage stim- ulated by a brisk host-response to infection .

Several lines of evidence indicate that the redundancy of signaling pathways re- sulting in proinflammatory gene expression especially the gen- eration of interleukin 1b leads to impaired bacterial clearance and airway damage in murine models of infection .Pseudomonas aeruginosa InfectionsPseudomona aeruginosa is a common cause of severe ICU infec- tions reviewed in this volume by Oliver and colleagues .
