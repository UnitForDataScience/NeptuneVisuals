 ARTICLELow dietary protein and high carbohydrate infant formula affects the microbial ecology of the large intestine in neonatal ratsWenguang Fan Haiwei Ren Yingying Cao Yonggang Wang and Guicheng HuoAbstract The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a low dietary protein and high carbohydrate infant formula on the large intestine of neonatal rats.

The pri- mary site of phenol and indole formation is in the large intestine and phenol has been shown to increase epithelial permeability .

The present study was conducted using a combination of 454 barcoded pyrosequencing per- formance liquid chromatography and RT-PCR.

The use of diets with low levels of high-quality protein and higher levels of carbohydrates may help us to produce an infant formula composition closer to that of human milk.Materials and methodsAnimal experimentsThe animal experiment was as shown in .

The study groups were weaned rats fed infant formula I group n  12 and weaned rats fed human breast milk H group n  12.

The pups in the I group were fed a standard moist diet   consisting of a porridge made by adding warm water to an infant formula at a final proportion of 65 g of infant formula to 15 mL of water.

The pups in the H group were fed human breast milk which was purchased from Harbin City Maternal and Child Health Care Center Heilongjiang Prov- ince.

The H and I groups were administered a 1.0 mL diet every 4 h including during the night.

The pups were weighed and mea- sured daily for weight loss or gain.

The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of North-Table 1.
