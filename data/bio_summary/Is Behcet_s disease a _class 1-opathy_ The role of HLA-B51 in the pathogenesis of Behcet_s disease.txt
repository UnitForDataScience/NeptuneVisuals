Thus altered peptide presentation by ERAP1 and HLA-B51 may interact with NK cells to lead to pathogenesis.NK cell interactions with HLA-B51 remain an attractive proposition for explaining BD pathogenesis however fur- ther research needs to be conducted into 'inhibitory' NK receptors that appear to actually play a more regulatory role.Misfolding of HLA proteins in BD pathogenesisAlternative pathogenic hypotheses linking HLA-B51 with BD might include effects on the gut microbiome or of HLA-B51 misfolding both mechanisms suggested for HLA-B27 and AS 8.

A clearer understanding of all the functions of HLA-B51 is thus needed in order to improve development of potential ther- apeutics based on the rational targeting of responsible mechanisms.Genetic links between HLA-B51 and BDThe link between carriage of HLA-B51 and BD develop- ment was first highlighted in 1973 with a higher frequency of what was then known as HL-A5 observed in patients n 5 21 compared to controls n 5 78 9.

Giza Queen's College High Street Oxford OX1 4AW UK.E-mail SummaryThe association between carriage of the human leucocyte antigen HLA-B51 allele and development of Behcet's disease BD has been known since the early 1970s but the exact mechanisms responsible for its role in pathogenesis remain much-debated.

Ultimately greater understanding of HLA-B51's unique role in BD will probably lead to improved development of therapeutic strategies.Keywords antigen presentationprocessing autoimmunity autoinflamma- tory diseaseIntroductionBehcet's disease BD is a rare chronic multi-system inflam- matory disorder characterized by recurrent relapsing oral and genital ulcers ocular involvement skin lesions arthritis and vasculitis 1.

Recent work analysing the peptidome of HLA-B51 suggests that altered peptide presentation by HLA-B51 is vital to the disease process.

Striped colour coding indicates more than one reported study of different prevalence rates.meta-analysis of 80 studies performed in a variety of differ- ent populations suggests that carriage of HLA-B51 or HLA-B5 the group of antigens of which B51 is a subcate- gory confers an odds ratio OR of 578 for developing BD and 590 when considering only HLA-B51 without a significant modifying effect of ethnicity 10.

Secondly nearby genetic variants that are in strong LD with HLA-B51 have been shown to be associated much less strongly with BD than HLA-B51 itself.

Finally HLA-B51 is itself a plausible contributor to disease with MHC class I mole- cules linked to a variety of diseases 7.Further evidence for the link between HLA-B51 and BD comes via its geographical epidemiology.
