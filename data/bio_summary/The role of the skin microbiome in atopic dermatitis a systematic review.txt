One RCT showed that cream containing 5 lysate of the nonpathogenic Pro- teobacteria Vitreoscilla filiformis significantly improved SCORAD TEWL the patient's assessment of itch and loss of sleep com- pared with placebo.4950 Ongoing studies by Gallo and col- leagues apply the same principle Table S2 see Supporting Information in an attempt to decrease S. aureus colonization in AD skin they are isolating beneficial Staphylococcal species from the patients themselves and placing them in a moistur- izer and applying the moisturizer to the subjects' own arms.To utilize the microbiome in prevention and treatment strate-gies of AD more data from human studies are needed on the skin microbiome dynamics related to clinical measures tempo- ral resolution and how different factors modify the microbial abundances to be able to predict responses in the microbiome to perturbations.

A trend for lower bacterial diversity in one control and two AD filaggrin-null mutation subjects was seen in the study by Chng et al.25 However the role of filag- grin on the skin microbiome in AD is not known and none of the studies included in this review could elaborate thoroughly on this.In line with the S. aureus data presented in this review a recent meta-analysis showed that patients with AD were more likely to be colonized with S. aureus than healthy controls with higher odds ratios OR for lesional skin OR 1974 95 con- fidence interval CI 1088-3581 than for nonlesional skin OR 777 95 CI 382-1582.10 With S. aureus being more abundant on nonlesional skin this suggests that the skin is sus- ceptible to pathogen colonization and at risk of progressing toward a diseased state.

The age of the participants ranged from 2 months to 62 years and both sexes were included in 10 of the 11 studies.15-22 AD was clin- ically characterized by SCOring of Atopic Dermatitis SCORAD in eight of the studies15-1921-23 Eczema Area and Severity Index in one24 and Rajka and Langeland in one.4 Patients with mild AD were included in two studies1620 moderate AD in nine415-202324 and patients with severe AD in seven.415-1719202425 Only one study distinguished micro- biome composition according to disease severity.20 The skin microbiomes of anatomically defined skin areas were inves- tigated in nine of the 11 studies.4151719-212325 Other studies compared affected with nonaffected skin sites.416182324c 2017 British Association of DermatologistsBritish Journal of Dermatology 2017 177 pp1272-12781274 The skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis R.D.

Controversy remains with regard to distinguishing between primary events leading to AD and secondary events resulting from AD.13 Whether the skin microbiome is a primary factor in AD pathogenesis is uncertain.This systematic review provides an overview of the AD skinmicrobiome profile.

Although skin dysbiosis and the microbiome are anticipated to have an important role in the development of treatments there has been no systematic review of the skin microbiome profile in AD.

The objective of this review is to describe the skin microbiome pro- file in AD and address whether there is a causal relationship between dysbiosis and AD.

Good speciation and strain-level identification in combination with RNA protein and metabolite data would strengthen such data and provide valuable insights.While the microbiome is increasingly drawing attention as a possible target in the prevention and treatment of AD new methodological approaches have not yet brought us far in understanding the impact of dysbiosis in AD.
