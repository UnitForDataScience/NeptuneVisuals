a trend for lower bacterial diversity in one control and two ad filaggrin-null mutation subjects was seen in the study by chng et al.25 however the role of filag- grin on the skin microbiome in ad is not known and none of the studies included in this review could elaborate thoroughly on this.in line with the s. aureus data presented in this review a recent meta-analysis showed that patients with ad were more likely to be colonized with s. aureus than healthy controls with higher odds ratios or for lesional skin or 1974 95 con- fidence interval ci 1088-3581 than for nonlesional skin or 777 95 ci 382-1582.10 with s. aureus being more abundant on nonlesional skin this suggests that the skin is sus- ceptible to pathogen colonization and at risk of progressing toward a diseased state.

the age of the participants ranged from 2 months to 62 years and both sexes were included in 10 of the 11 studies.15-22 ad was clin- ically characterized by scoring of atopic dermatitis scorad in eight of the studies15-1921-23 eczema area and severity index in one24 and rajka and langeland in one.4 patients with mild ad were included in two studies1620 moderate ad in nine415-202324 and patients with severe ad in seven.415-1719202425 only one study distinguished micro- biome composition according to disease severity.20 the skin microbiomes of anatomically defined skin areas were inves- tigated in nine of the 11 studies.4151719-212325 other studies compared affected with nonaffected skin sites.416182324c 2017 british association of dermatologistsbritish journal of dermatology 2017 177 pp1272-12781274 the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis r.d.

controversy remains with regard to distinguishing between primary events leading to ad and secondary events resulting from ad.13 whether the skin microbiome is a primary factor in ad pathogenesis is uncertain.this systematic review provides an overview of the ad skinmicrobiome profile.

the objective of this review is to describe the skin microbiome pro- file in ad and address whether there is a causal relationship between dysbiosis and ad.

good speciation and strain-level identification in combination with rna protein and metabolite data would strengthen such data and provide valuable insights.while the microbiome is increasingly drawing attention as a possible target in the prevention and treatment of ad new methodological approaches have not yet brought us far in understanding the impact of dysbiosis in ad.

other important aspects are temporal dynamics and the influence of methodology on microbiome data.1272british journal of dermatology 2017 177 pp1272-1278c 2017 british association of dermatologiststhe skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis r.d.

much research has focused on the gut microbiome where findings demonstrate associations between dysbiosis and diseases such as diabetes and asthma.1 the number of skin microbiome studies is rising.

the skin is composed of a variety of niches selecting for colonization by specific microorganisms.2 host factors for example sex age and environmental expo- sures3-6 also affect the niches and microbiome communities and it is becoming increasingly apparent that the skin micro- biome in turn influences vital functions in the host such as immunity and colonization by pathogenic microorganisms.5atopic dermatitis ad is a chronic skin disease affecting up to 20 of children it is less prevalent in adults.7 depending on age it manifests at different sites with dry itchy skin and relapsing eczema in infants the cheeks are typically the first place to be affected in toddlers it is the extensor aspects of joints in older children it is flexure aspects of joints and it has a varied presentation in adults.
