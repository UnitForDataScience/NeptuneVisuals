Thus this review offers an insight into the composition of these sites the gut and the lung their role in shaping the immune system and finally their role in the response to lung cancer.IntroductionThe microbiota is a consortium of different microorgan- isms that includes bacteria microbiota fungi mycobiota viruses and protozoa  residing on the skin and in the oral pulmonary urogenital and gastrointestinal GI cavities--with the gastrointestinal having the highest density of microbiota.

Over 90 of bacterial cells are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes followed by Actinobacteria Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia together constituting 99 of the overall commensal microbiota Around 60 species have been identified as the core microbiota mostly bacteria from the Bacteroides Bifidobacterium Eubacterium Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium genera as well as a few others .

An overview of different studies investigating the composition of the respiratory system microbiota is presented in Table The ecological determinants of the lung microbiota immigration elimination and regional growth conditions change during acute and chronic lung disease as seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD often a pre- cancerous inflammatory state and lung cancer Table   .

A high-fibre diet in mice has been shown to increase SCFA cir- culating blood levels but no traces in the lung itself and has been shown to be responsible for increased protection against allergic inflammation in the lung reduced inflammatory cell infiltration followed by a change in the intestinal and to a lesser extent the airway microbiota 92.The above-mentioned findings clearly show how impor- tant the overall composition of the intestinal microbiota is for a productive immunological response in the lung.

Unlike the local and systemic influence of intestinal microbiota the influence of lung microbiota and its products and their circulation is yet to be properly assessed.
