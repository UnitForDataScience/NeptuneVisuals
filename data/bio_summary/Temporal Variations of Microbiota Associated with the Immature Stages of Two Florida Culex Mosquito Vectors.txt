nigripalpus respectively.Comparison of Bacterial Communities Associated with Culex nigripalpus and Culex coronatorBeta diversity analyses using non-metric multidimensional scaling NMDS of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that bacterial community composition differed significantly be- tween the two Culex mosquito species Fig.

Other 17 phyla contributed only 0.001 of the total sequences.Indicates bacterial phyla from pupae samples of Culex nigripalpusDiscussionOur results revealed distinct bacterial communities associated with the immature stages of Culex nigripalpus and Culex coronator mosquitoes.

We sought to determine whether the mosquito microbiota associated with immature stages of two congeners Culex coronator and Culex nigripalpus differ temporally and between the two species.

Boxes in b are colored by the species of mosquito that were sampled on that date Culex coronator red and Culex nigripalpus blueFig.

To our knowledge this study is the first attempt comparing microbiota of a native and an exotic invasive Culex mosquito species and will be used as a foundation to further decipher whether these differences are widespread among different mosquito populations from dif- ferent geographic locations and to determine the influence of indicator bacterial symbionts on mosquito development con- trol or disease transmission.Acknowledgements We are grateful to Katja Engel and Arthur Domingos for their technical assistance.
