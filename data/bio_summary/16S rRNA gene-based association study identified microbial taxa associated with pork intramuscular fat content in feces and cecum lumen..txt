the output result was visualized using ggplot2 in r package.resultsbacteria and potential function capacities enriched in cecum lumen and fecescecum lumen obtained an average of 718 otus in the tested samples ranging from 195 to 995 while the aver- age number of otus for fecal samples was 888 which ranged from 618 to 1066. the a-diversity of microbialcommunity of cecum lumen and feces was described in our previous publication here we focused on the identification of bacterial genera enriched in cecum lumen and feces respectively.

26 out of the 29 genera showed distinct relative abun- dances between cecum lumen and feces p  0.05 in- cluding 12 genera enriched in the cecum lumen and 14 genera showing higher abundances in the feces.to compare the potential function capacity of mi- crobial community between cecum lumen and feces the relative abundances of kegg pathways were pre- dicted by picrust based on 16s rrna gene se- quences.

correlation coefficients between imf values and relative abundances of kegg pathways were calcu- lated by using maaslin online galaxy version the significant threshold was set at fdr  0.05.identifying the taxonomic drivers of functional shiftsto evaluate the contribution of the imf-associated otus to functional shifts of gut microbiome we used fishtaco analysis to establish the correlation between imf-associated otus and functional capacities as de- scribed by borenstein et al.
