26 out of the 29 genera showed distinct relative abun- dances between cecum lumen and feces P  0.05 in- cluding 12 genera enriched in the cecum lumen and 14 genera showing higher abundances in the feces.To compare the potential function capacity of mi- crobial community between cecum lumen and feces the relative abundances of KEGG pathways were pre- dicted by PICRUSt based on 16S rRNA gene se- quences.

Fang et al.

For instances Backhed et al.

showed that germ-free mice have 40 less fat mass than normal conventionalized mice Turnbaugh et al.

Devadder et al.

re- vealed that microbial degradation of dietary fiber to SCFAs plays causal roles in the metabolic benefits Semova et al.

He et al.

identified several gut microbial taxa showing significant associations with porcine back- fat thickness and abdominal fat weight Yan et al.

Yan et al.

Correlation coefficients between IMF values and relative abundances of KEGG pathways were calcu- lated by using MaAsLin online Galaxy version The significant threshold was set at FDR  0.05.Identifying the taxonomic drivers of functional shiftsTo evaluate the contribution of the IMF-associated OTUs to functional shifts of gut microbiome we used FishTaco analysis to establish the correlation between IMF-associated OTUs and functional capacities as de- scribed by Borenstein et al.
