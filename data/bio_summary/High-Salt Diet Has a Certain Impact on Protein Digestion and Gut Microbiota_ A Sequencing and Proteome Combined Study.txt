bacteroidales s24-7 group was a predominant genus in each group which had the highest abundance 45.40 and was followed by lachnospiraceaenk4a136 group 8.47 lactobacillus 6.95 alistipes4.76 ruminococcaceae ucg-014 4.20 and akkermansia 3.46. after feeding for 8 weeks faecalibaculum became the predominant genus 30.18 and followed by bacteroidales s24-7 group 26.86 rikenellaceae rc9 gut group 7.31 lachnospiraceae 4.86 ruminococcaceae 3.79 and lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group 3.66. in the blsd group bacteroidales s24-7 group was the most abundant 18.84 and followed by faecalibaculum 12.90 bifidobacterium 9.62 erysipelotrichaceae 9.14 akkermansia 8.46 and rikenellaceae rc9 gut group 4.28. after 8-week feeding bacteroidales s24-7 group was still the most abundant 37.81 and followed by lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group 9.76 faecalibaculum 9.61 ruminococcaceae ucg-014 4.65alistipes 4.22 and lactobacillus 3.61.linear discriminant analysis of fecal microbiotathe above results showed that all samples can be divided into the hsd and the lsd classes.

five proteins cytidylate kinase trigger factor 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase transporter and undecaprenyl-diphosphatase had a higher abundance in the high-salt diet group than those in the low-salt group while two proteins acetylglutamate kinase and pbsx phage manganese-containing catalase were over-expressed in the low-salt diet group than in the high-salt group.

in colon contents 17 microbial proteins were common in the low- and the high-salt diet groups.five proteins had a higher abundance in the high-salt diet group than those in the lsd group supplementary table s3 including cytidylate kinase trigger factor 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase transporter and undecaprenyl-diphosphatase which were secreted by different gut bacteria including atopobium parvulum anaerococcus prevotii lactobacillus brevis anaerostipes hadrus and streptococcus agalactiae.

fourteen of these otus were higher in the hsd group and 29 otus were higher in the lsd group p  0.05. as compared to the lsd group the hsd group had higher abundances p  0.05 of lachnospiraceae otu473 otu525 otu243 and otu88 and ruminococcaceae otu214 otu165 otu213 and otu312 but lower abundance p  0.05 of lactobacillus otu13.

hsd high-salt diet group after feeding lsd low-salt diet group after feeding.the results suggested that the high-salt diet may have an inhibitory effect on pancreatic secretion by inhibiting the secretion of trypsin thus leading to lower protein digestion and absorption efficiency compared to the lsd groups.

however less has been known about alterations in gut microbiota protein digestion and absorption in response to a high-salt diet.the purpose of this study was to demonstrate how a high-salt diet affected the composition of gut microbiota and the extent of protein digestion and absorption.

ten male c57bl6j mice were obtainedfrom nanjing biomedical research institute of nanjing university and housed in a specific pathogen-free animal center syxk  jiangsu  2011-0037. after 2 weeks adaptation the mice were randomly assigned to a high-salt diet group or a low-salt diet group.

the dominant bacteria were firmicutes 58.62 and followed by bacteroidetes 35.35 verrucomicrobia 1.17 actinobacteria 1.02 and proteobacteria 0.77. in the blsd group firmicutes was the predominant phyla 49.62 and followed by bacteroidetes 26.25 actinobacteria 12.96proteobacteria 1.29 and verrucomicrobia 1.29. after 8- week feeding lsd group the abundance of firmicutes was decreased to 44.79 while the abundance of bacteroidetes was increased to 46.16. the high-salt diet induced an increase in the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes while the low-salt diet tended to decrease the ratio p  0.05 .on the genus level  the differential sequences were matched with 50 genera.

several differential proteins were digestive enzymes including chymotrypsinogen b precursor pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase precursor carboxypeptidase a1 precursor and carboxypeptidase b1 which had lower abundance in hsd group as compared to the lsd group p  0.05. these results indicated that high-salt diet may inhibit the excretion of the digestive enzymes.

bacterial otus rich in the low-salt diet group green bars and the high-salt diet group red bars.

in other words the high-salt diet might cause the reduction in gut microbial diversity.hierarchical clustering analysis of fecal bacteria on the otu level declared that the low-salt diet group showed a great intra-group variation among samples .

81838.doi high-salt diet has been considered to cause health problems but it is still less known how high-salt diet affects gut microbiota protein digestion and passage in the digestive tract.

consequently high-salt diet may alter the composition of gut microbiota and has a certain impact on protein digestion.keywords high salt gut microbiota feces proteome 16s rrna sequencingintroductionepidemiological evidence suggested that the intake of salt especially sodium chloride may increase the risk of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension stroke and other cardiovascular diseases          .

although sodium chloride needs not to be digested sodium and chloride ions would help us to digest and absorb the nutrients the presence of sodium is still critical when the intestinal cells move nutrients into the blood stream.a high-salt diet was also observed to have a certain effect on gut microbiota composition and microbial proteins in gut contents.

therefore the mechanism of high-salt diet shaping gut microbiota may be as follows high sodium intake may increase the activity of nah exchange which is highly correlated with gut microbiota and then lead to the alterations of microbial profiles.
