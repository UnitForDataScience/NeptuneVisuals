We found that 103 genes were expressed differentially by B cells from mice fed the HAMSA diet relative to such expression by B cells from mice fed the HAMS diet and 355 were expressed differentially by B cells from mice fed the HAMSB diet relative to such expression by B cells from mice fed the HAMS diet and Supplementary Fig.

f Single-cell gene expression log2 arbitrary units Ex in CD45RBloCD25 CD4 T cells from the PLNs of female NOD mice fed the HAMS diet n  20 cells HAMSA diet n  14 cells or HAMSB diet n  29 cells key.

These differences in the frequency of Tet cells and Tet- cells suggested that the HAMSA diet suppressed the proliferation of autoreactive T cells.Alteration in B cell differentiation and function by SCFAs Antigen-presenting B cells serve an important role in the population expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells in NOD mice by directly pre- senting islet antigens to T cells.

Thus SCFAs in particular acetate altered the number differentiation gene transcription and surface phenotype of B cells which probably affected the ability of B cells to expand populations of autoreactive T cells in vivo.Enhancement of Treg cells in NOD mice by butyrateWe considered whether the much greater than expected delivery of acetate and butyrate to the portal vein and peripheral blood achieved by feeding mice the HAMSA or HAMSB diet might modulate the biol- ogy of peripheral Treg cells in NOD mice.

Feeding NOD mice the HAMSA diet in particular markedly inhibited the proliferation of NOD8.3 T cells g.To determine whether SCFAs affected the ability of B cells to induce T cell proliferation in vitro we cultured purified CD4 T cells with irradiated NOD B cells pre-stimulated with insulin peptide in the pres- ence or absence of acetate or butyrate.

The HAMSA diet increased the abun- dance of Treg cells and decreased the abundance of autoreactive T cells in NOD.Gpr43 mice but not in their NOD.Gpr43-- lit- termates relative to the abundance of such cells in their counterparts fed the NP diet Supplementary Fig.

Both the acetate-yielding diet and butyrate-yielding diet also increased frequency and number of splenic Treg cells relative to that of such cells in mice fed the NP diet .

Downregulation of the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class I on B cells of NOD mice fed the HAMSA diet cor- related with a low frequency of IGRPCD8 T cells and greatly dimin- ished the population expansion of autoreactive NOD8.3 T cells in vivo.
