Here we review current knowledge of gut microbiota impacts on epigenetic modifications the major evidence of which centers on DNA methylation and his- tone modification of the immune system.Keywords Gut microbiota  Epigenetic modifications DNA methylation  Histone modificationIntroductionThe human gut microbiota is populated with over 100 trillion cells of potentially 100-1000 microbial species   which have been shown to be involved in mainte- nance of human health and pathogenesis of disease .

This1158Dig Dis Sci 2017 621155-1164is one of the first studies that underline the association of the gut microbiota with DNA methylation profiles.Influences of Pathogenic Bacteria on DNA MethylationExamples of DNA methylation effects of pathogenic bac- teria such as Helicobacter pylori and Klebsiella spp on the host have also been characterized recently.

In addition to global DNAmethylation other bacterial metabolites that relate to DNA methylation are summarized in Table .Many evidences have shown a close relation between gut microbiota and DNA methylation both in basic researches and clinical findings.

However in addition to CpG islands CpG dinucleotides are predominately methylated .In mammals DNA methylation is catalyzed by three members of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT family DNMT1 DNMT3a and DNMT3b .

Similarly Hp-positive healthy volunteers had a higher level of DNA methylation of three miRNA genes miR- 124a-1 miR-124a-2 and miR-124a-3 in gastric mucosae than Hp-negative individuals indicating that H. pylori infection can induce DNA methylation of miRNA genes in addition to protein-coding genes.
