here we review current knowledge of gut microbiota impacts on epigenetic modifications the major evidence of which centers on dna methylation and his- tone modification of the immune system.keywords gut microbiota  epigenetic modifications dna methylation  histone modificationintroductionthe human gut microbiota is populated with over 100 trillion cells of potentially 100-1000 microbial species   which have been shown to be involved in mainte- nance of human health and pathogenesis of disease .

results in over 200 regions of differential dna modification .influences of gut microbiota on histone modificationsthe gut microbiota plays a role in uptaking and secreting minerals that act as cofactors for enzymes participating in epigenetic regulation such as cobalt iodine selenium and abovementioned zinc.

the consequences of histone methyla- tion for gene expression are complex as methylation may have opposite consequences depending on localization and number of methyl groups.influences of gut microbiota on epigenetic modificationan intricate and dynamic relationship exists between the gut microbiota the immune system and epigenetic modi- fications .

this1158dig dis sci 2017 621155-1164is one of the first studies that underline the association of the gut microbiota with dna methylation profiles.influences of pathogenic bacteria on dna methylationexamples of dna methylation effects of pathogenic bac- teria such as helicobacter pylori and klebsiella spp on the host have also been characterized recently.

in addition to global dnamethylation other bacterial metabolites that relate to dna methylation are summarized in table .many evidences have shown a close relation between gut microbiota and dna methylation both in basic researches and clinical findings.

here we will discuss recent clues lanjuan li jianzhong ye wenrui wu yating li 1 state key laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease the first affiliated hospital college of medicine zhejiang university hangzhou 310003 china2 collaborative innovation center for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases zhejiang universityhangzhou 310003 chinathat implicate influences of gut microbiota on epigenetic modifications.epigenetic modificationsthe term epigenetic was first coined by conrad waddington for the underlying mechanisms that converted identical genetic information into diverse phenotypes .

revealed that dna methylation profiles in blood of preg- nant women correlated with gut microbiota patterns.

the influence of gut microbiome on the epigenetic regulation of host genes has been demonstrated with toll-like receptor 2 tlr2- knockout mice   in which the dna methylation and gene expression in colonic mucosa of wild-type and tlr2-- c57bl6 mice were interrogated.

similarly short-chain fatty acids scfas isothiocyanate and allyl compounds derived from human gut microflora have been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase hdac activity  .short-chain fatty acids scfas generated through dietary carbohydrates fermentation by the gut microbiota many of which in the class clostridia of firmicutes phyla are thought to be mainly responsible for histone modifi- cations.

in spite of increasing studies in gut microbiota and epigenetic modi- fications the correlation between them has not been well elaborated.

the immune system develops symbiotic relationship with gut microbiota that shapes the diversity and abundance of microbiota .

in turn gut microbiota and induced epigenetic modification is essential for the development and maturation of intestinal mucosal immune system of its hosts -.

as epigenetic modifications of intestinal mucosal immune system mediate cross talk between gut microbiota and the mammalian host we focus our attention on immune development.
