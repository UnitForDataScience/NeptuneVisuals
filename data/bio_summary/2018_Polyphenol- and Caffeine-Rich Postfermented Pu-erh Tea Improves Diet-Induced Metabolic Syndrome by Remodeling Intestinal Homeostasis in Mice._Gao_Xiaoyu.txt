We also observed that PE TP OTP and CAF drastically altered the gut microbial community structure and specific gut bacteria in the HFD-fed mice and improved the HFD-induced gut microbiota imbalance.

The significant changes in Firmicutes and FirmicutesBacteroidetes further confirmed that PE TP OTP and CAF administration caused a drastic shift in the HFD-fed mouse gut microbial community structure and .Compared to the HFD group the PE and TP treatments increased the abundance of the Eubacterium rectaleClostridium coccoides group F. prausnitzii A. muciniphila Bifi- dobacterium spp.

In summary polyphenol- and CAF-rich PE improved diet-induced MS and this effect was associ- ated with a remodeling of the gut microbiota.KEYWORDS metabolic syndrome gut microbiota Akkermansia muciniphila metabolic endotoxemia fat browning inflammatory responsesumanity is facing an epidemic of metabolic syndrome MS which is characterized by a cluster of metabolic disorders including obesity insulin INS resistance dyslipidemia dysglycemia hepatic steatosis and nonoptimal blood pressure levels  .

Altogether the HFD triggered an inflammatory response and compromised the gut barrier function however administration of PE TP OTP and CAF repaired the disrupted intestinal homeostasis to different extents.PEAC administration restored the HFD-induced gut microbial community struc- tural shift.

Meanwhile PE reduced the mRNA expres- sion of liver inflammatory factors to  suggesting that PE also improved the HFD-induced hepatic inflammation.FIG 1 Effects of PEAC administration on the body weight and energy efficiency in mice.

In particular the PE TP OTP and CAF treatments significantly reduced the HFD- induced intestinal inflammatory responses PE TP and OTP downregulated the mRNA expression of Reg3g and Pla2g2 to the levels observed in the NCD group and recovered the expression levels of Muc2 Occludin and ZO-1 to various extents.

Animal experiments were performed to determine whether the gut microbiota mediated the improve- ment in diet-induced MS by PE and its main active components PEAC.

The partial least squares-discriminant analysis PLS-DA results further con- firmed that PE TP OTP and CAF restored the HFD-induced gut microbial community structure Fig.

S3C.A hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed that 2 and 12 weeks of the PE TP and CAF treatment and 12 weeks of the OTP treatment dramatically improved the disrupted gut microbial community structure  and .

SU Sutterella spp.The hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the impacts of PE TP and CAF on the specific gut bacteria in the HFD-fed mice were significant and homogeneous see Fig.
