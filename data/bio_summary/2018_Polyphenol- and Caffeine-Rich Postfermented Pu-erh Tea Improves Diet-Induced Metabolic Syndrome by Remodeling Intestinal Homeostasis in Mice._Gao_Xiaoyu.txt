Specific symbols indicate significant differences between two groups using the unpaired two-tailed Student t test  P  0.05 HFD versus NCD  P  0.05 NCD-PE versus NCD D P  0.05 HFD-PE versus HFD  P  0.05 HFD-TP versus HFD  P  0.05 HFD-CAF versus HFD  P  0.05.

We also observed that PE TP OTP and CAF drastically altered the gut microbial community structure and specific gut bacteria in the HFD-fed mice and improved the HFD-induced gut microbiota imbalance.

The significant changes in Firmicutes and FirmicutesBacteroidetes further confirmed that PE TP OTP and CAF administration caused a drastic shift in the HFD-fed mouse gut microbial community structure and .Compared to the HFD group the PE and TP treatments increased the abundance of the Eubacterium rectaleClostridium coccoides group F. prausnitzii A. muciniphila Bifi- dobacterium spp.

In summary polyphenol- and CAF-rich PE improved diet-induced MS and this effect was associ- ated with a remodeling of the gut microbiota.KEYWORDS metabolic syndrome gut microbiota Akkermansia muciniphila metabolic endotoxemia fat browning inflammatory responsesumanity is facing an epidemic of metabolic syndrome MS which is characterized by a cluster of metabolic disorders including obesity insulin INS resistance dyslipidemia dysglycemia hepatic steatosis and nonoptimal blood pressure levels  .

Altogether the HFD triggered an inflammatory response and compromised the gut barrier function however administration of PE TP OTP and CAF repaired the disrupted intestinal homeostasis to different extents.PEAC administration restored the HFD-induced gut microbial community struc- tural shift.
