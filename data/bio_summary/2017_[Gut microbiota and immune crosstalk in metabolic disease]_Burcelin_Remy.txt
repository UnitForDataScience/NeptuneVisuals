Such novel strategies should hamper the role played by gut microbiota dysbiosis on the development of metabolic inflammation.Major conclusions Recent evidence in rodents allows us to conclude that an impaired intestinal immune system characterizes and could be causal in the development of metabolic disease.

To design treatments for chronic metabolic impairments one should consider the molecular underpinnings of both the impaired microbiome and the impaired immune systemThe causal role of gut microbiota on metabolic diseases has been shown in rodents through microbiota transfer experiments and in humans demonstrating that the microbiota from a healthy donor could improve the body weight and glycemia of an obese and diabetic receiver respectively.

The hologenome theory of evolution supports this concept and implies that therapeutic strategies aiming to control glycemia should take into account both the gut microbiota and the host immune system.Scope of review This review discusses the latest evidence regarding the bidirectional impact of the gut microbiota on host immune system crosstalk for the control of metabolic disease hyperglycemia and obesity.

ReviewGut microbiota and immune crosstalk in metabolic diseaseRemy Burcelin ABSTRACTBackground Gut microbiota is considered as a major regulator of metabolic disease.

This crosstalk could be the first concept integrating the impact of the environment social nutritional chemical and behavioral with the genetic of the host to explain the diversity and the development of metabolic disease in light of the definition of the holobiont.This review will highlight the recent discoveries in the microbiota to host immune crosstalk with respect to metabolic disease.

B cells reduce the number of regulatory T-cells and overall control T-cells activation .Altogether the infiltration of adaptive immune cells characterized by a specific repertoire within the stroma vascular fraction of metabolic tissues during diet-induced obesity seems to be a first step towards metabolic inflammation.

The first causal role of metabolic endo- toxemia in the development of metabolic disease was shown when a chronic one month long low grade infusion of LPS was performed in the mouse .

The authors of this study identified the mechanism as increased energy efficiency with the potential for the gut microbiota toFigure 2 Gut microbiota to intestinal immune defense interplay for the control of bacterial translocation-induced tissue inflammation and metabolic control.

Un- fortunately the studies could not identify the host dependent mech- anism responsible for the graft efficiency.In the last decade other mechanisms reconciling the immune system particularly as relates to metabolic inflammation with gut microbiota dysbiosis have been proposed.

A key question resides in the identification of the antigens accumulating within the tissues.Recent evidences from our laboratory suggested that bacterial frag- ments from the gut microbiota could translocate to tissues and initiate metabolic inflammation .
