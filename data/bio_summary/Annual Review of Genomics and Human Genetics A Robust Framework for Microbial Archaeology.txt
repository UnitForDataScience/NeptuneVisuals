The discovery of such microbial mating systems earned the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg 82 who incidentally later went on to popularize the term microbiome in 2001 101.At the heart of the microbial species problem is a tension between methods-based and methods- free species definitions in part reflecting philosophical differences in the fields of microbial sys- tematics and evolutionary biology.

Instead overlapping systems of both formal and provisional schemes are currently in use which both facilitate and limit the study of individual microbes and communities as well as the reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes and microbiota.Valid Species Names and Microbial SystematicsDespite the difficulty of defining what a microbial species is methods for granting valid microbial species names are outlined by the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria set forth bythe International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes ICSP  98 186.

Microeukaryotes and viruses are thus beyond the scope of this review even though noteworthy achievements have been made in the successful genetic characterization of potato late blight evolution 116 205 barley stripe mosaic virus 176 Spanish influenza strains 189 early simian immunodeficiency virus 150 and seventeenth- and eighteenth-century smallpox strains 12 42.Although species annotations are routinely applied to microbial taxa there is relatively little consensus on what a microbial species actually is 2 40.

As of November 2016 the HOMD included 687 species-level oral taxa of which 335 had both a valid species name and at least one sequenced genome 36 had a valid species name and no sequenced genome 88 had no valid species name but at least one sequenced genome and 228 had no valid species name and no sequenced genome.

Such problems reached a critical point in 2005 when a prominent review of aDNA research summed up the field of microbial archaeology as the microbial problem and largely dismissed it as a discipline 200.The advent of HTS technologies in the mid-2000s presented a powerful solution to the inherent shortcomings of conventional PCR-based approaches and this new technology has dramatically influenced the field of microbial archaeology.

Given that only a small fraction of microbial taxa can currently be cultivated using known techniques 147 193 this definition is poorly suited to the identification of most microbial species.

Despite the messiness of microbial phylogenies 66 however microbes generally behave as ecologically coherent entities at the levels of species genus family and order as currently defined by 16S rRNA gene sequence cutoffs 148.THE POWER AND PITFALLS OF NAMESNames are powerful entities that allow microbial taxa to be discussed and analyzed in a meaningful way.

This scheme however is limited to microbes of the human oral cavity and is not generalizable to other microbiomes such as those of the human gut soil or ocean.Alternatively as of March 2017 GenBank 11 131 contains 14022 sequenced microbial genomes and maintains a taxonomy common tree of 23653 named and candidatus microbial species 993 archaea and 22660 bacteria that does not follow a single taxonomic treatise but rather attempts to incorporate phylogenetic and taxonomic knowledge from a variety of sources 127.

By taking this pragmatic approach they are able to utilize a diverse range of existing phenotypic genetic and genomic microbial data in a common phylogenetic framework 165.Taxonomy Versus PhylogenyAlthough species names are practical entities that allow microbial taxa to be discussed and analyzed in a meaningful way they can also be misleading.

Unlike Ernst Mayr's birds microbes adhere to few if any of the tenets of the biological species concept 35 72 117 and although many microbial species concepts have been proposed none have been widely accepted 2.
