Similar trends have been proposed as indicators of a wide range of disturbances in tropical corals including nutrient enrichment and temperature increases However the winter populations of A. poculata sampled in this study did not exhibit signs of disease and A. poculata has been documented to survive quiescence during extended periods of extreme low winter tempera- tures Thus the A. poculata wintertime microbiome likely does not reflect a disease state but potentially a general dysbiosis due to meta-organism quiescence or lack of host metabolic activity that serves to regulate microbiome structure as described in It is there- fore feasible that what has been observed as disease- associated microbiome signatures i.e.

As a consequence A. poculata metabolic rates vary seasonally with the coral entering into quiescencedormancy during winter months   with reduced symbiosis during this quiescent period Studies of A. poculata in its natural environment across seasons therefore allow testing of the influence of symbiosis and seasonality on other aspects of the meta-organism.Here we present the first description of prokaryotic diversity in the coral A. poculata sampled over seasons from a location in Narragansett Bay Rhode Island near the northernmost limit of the species range.

Of approximately 28000 unique OTUs recovered from A. poculata samples 97 were present in  90 of samples see Additional file  while only 25 OTUs were present across all A. poculata samples.Microbiome taxa differing in relative abundance by season The seasonal shifts in the composition of A. poculata and seawater microbiomes involved changes in the rela- tive abundance of specific taxa.

Together these patterns indicate a relative uniformity of coral microbiomes during spring and that a shift in coral microbiome composition during this period contributed substantially to the overall seasonal variation.Influence of symbiotic state on A. poculata microbiome compositionIn contrast to results based on season and to our expec- tations two-way ANOVA analysis of four indices of alpha diversity did not demonstrate a strong influence of symbiont state brown or white on A. poculata micro- biomes Fig.

Notably alpha diversity of cold deep- water corals has been shown to be even lower Furthermore within each seasonal time point overall microbiome composition in A. poculata was remarkablyuniform between samples a pattern that also differs from that of tropical scleractinian coral microbiomes It is possible that emergence from quiescence may catalyze an annual re-organization of the A. poculata microbiome each spring.

This transition appears to homogenize microbiome structure across individuals potentially reflecting a conserved functional response of the microbiome to an increase in holobiont metabolic rates and is consistent with the recent obser- vation of periodic microbiome succession in the tropical coral Porites astreoides in response to cyclical mucus shedding Microbiome membersThe seasonal shifts in A. poculata microbiome compos- ition primarily involved changes in the relative abun- dance of common bacterial classes.

A. pocu- lata engages in facultative symbiosis with only one species of symbiont Symbiodinium psygmophilum ITS2 Type B2  Sympatric A. poculata individuals can exhibit wide variation in S. psygmophilum density As a temperate species A. poculata also experiences a wide range of temperatures throughout the year.

When season was removed from the analysis no dissimilarity was found between all brown and all white A. poculata individuals ANOSIM R  - 0.014 p  0.844 PERMANOVA F  0.83 p  0.746.Dominant microbiome taxaOTUs from this A. poculata specimen collection span- ning the four seasonal time points and regardless of symbiotic state consistently were dominated by six mainclasses or phyla of prokaryotes the g-proteobacteria a-proteobacteria d-proteobacteria Flavobacteriia Cytophagia and Thaumarchaea Fig.

Central recovery rather than perimeter recovery was the dominant mode of polyp regeneration in A. poculata demon- strating relatively high-energy reserves on a per-polyp basis  It is also possible that Symbiodinium psygmophilum photosynthesis in A. poculata does not constitute a major supply of organic matter for either the microbiome or the host even during the warmest summer months.

The A. poculata microbiome exhibited significant relative increases in members of the Bacteroidales Clostri- diales and Synechococcus from spring to summer time points whereas the relative abundance ofRhodobacteraceae Rickettsiaceae and Verrucomi- crobiaceae decreased significantly in the summer see Additional file DiscussionThis study sampled a temperate naturally facultative symbiotic coral Astrangia poculata across seasons to test whether symbiotic state density of the symbiont Symbiodinium psygmophilum in the coral tissue structures the coral-associated microbiome.
