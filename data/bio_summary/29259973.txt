in contrast the nih-aarp cohort study found that whole grain intake was associated with a decreased risk for men 1.19 ozday but not women 0.98 ozday 1 oz  28.35 g whereas legumes did not influence crc risk for either men 0.09 cupsday or women 0.06 cupsday .in the italian epic cohort no association was found between pasta used as proxy for grains or legume intake and crc risk when comparing the third pasta 71.9-431.5 gday legumes 23.6-281.4 gday to the first pasta 0-37.9 gday legumes 0-11.8 gday tertile of consumption .

however medium 0.5 lday and high 0.5 lday wine intakes were associated with increased risk compared to no consumption and there was a significant lineartrend across tertiles ptrend  0.006. on the other hand using an adjusted model no significant association was noted for low tertile 2 medium tertile 3 or high tertile 4 intake .similarly analyses of data from the nih-aarp study indicated no association between alcohol consumption 5-25 gday and crc risk for either men or women .a pooled analysis of men and women from the italian cohort of the epic study found no associated risk for any category of alcohol intake .

possibly adher- ence to a whole md pattern may explain the reduced associa- tion between meat consumption alone and crc risk in certain mediterranean populations.table 9  summary of studies investigating association between consumption of animal sources of protein and crc risk.areverse scored comparing low intake to high intake using high intake as referent.fatskey elements of the md include reduced consumption of sfa from butter and higher intake of mufa from olive oil.

this idea has been tested in a prospective study in the united kingdom and showed a decreased risk of uc in association with increased intake of dha and borderline significant lower risk with epa and total n-3 intake .

in men there was no association with crc risk for the middle tertile of alcohol intake median intake  5.6 gday whereas an increased risk was observed for the highest tertile median  23.1 gday.

using an adjusted model these investigators estimated that moderate alcohol intake 12-35 gday was associated with decreased crc risk higher levels 36-48 gday had no association whereas thehighest level of intake  48 gday was associated with increased risk .

in contrast vegetable and fruit intake were associated with decreased risk of crc in a pooled analysis of three italian case-control studies conducted by rosato et al.

in women neither category of intake was associated with higher risk .to evaluate the association between crc and alcohol con- sumption type and quantity kontou et al.

these data suggested that fol- lowing a md eating pattern may mitigate some of the risk of crc associated with higher alcohol intake .rosato et al.
