Adherence to theTABLe 5  Summary of studies investigating association between MD adherence and colorectal cancer-related mortality.TABLe 6  Summary of meta-analyses investigating the association between MD and colorectal cancer risk.MD was defined as a pattern that placed no restriction on total fat intake and included two or more of the following compo- nents a high MUFASFA ratio high fruit and vegetable intake high consumption of legumes high grain and cereal intake moderate red wine consumption moderate consumption of dairy products and low consumption of meat and meat prod- ucts with increased intake of fish.

Possibly adher- ence to a whole MD pattern may explain the reduced associa- tion between meat consumption alone and CRC risk in certain Mediterranean populations.TABLe 9  Summary of studies investigating association between consumption of animal sources of protein and CRC risk.aReverse scored comparing low intake to high intake using high intake as referent.FatsKey elements of the MD include reduced consumption of SFA from butter and higher intake of MUFA from olive oil.

459. doi Colorectal cancer CRC is the third most common cancer diagnosis and the second and third leading cause of cancer mortality in men and women respectively.

We close with a discussion of future research frontiers in CRC prevention with particular reference to the role of epigenetic mechanisms and microbiome related to the MD eating pattern.Keywords nutrition carcinogenesis inflammatory bowel diseases epigenetics microbiomeiNTRODUCTiONDespite advancements in screening and diagnosis colorectal cancer CRC remains the third most common cancer in the USA and the second and third leading cause of cancer mortality in men and women respectively .

Applying principle components analysis to dietary intake data investigators identified three distinct dietary patterns 1 a MD pattern characterized by high consumption of olive oil fresh fruit vegetables legumes lean meat and fresh fish intake and low consumption of coffee meat beer fats whole-grain bread and cereals and delicatessen 2 a Western dietary pat- tern with high intake of potatoes fats delicatessen products high-fat meat beer rice pasta refined bread and cereals nuts and sodas and 3 a snacks dietary pattern with high positive loading for high-fat delicatessen meats high-fat cheese desserts and sweets beer soda and mineral water.

An example query for a secondary search was Mediterranean vegetables AND colorectal cancer or Mediterranean dairy AND colorectal cancer.

In secondary analyses stratified by cancer site the MD decreased risk of colon proximal colon distalcolon and rectal cancer  .CohortsUnlike case-control studies which suggested a decreased risk of CRC with adherence to a MD results of cohort studies  have been somewhat inconclusive.

In HCT116 human colon cancer cells the deleted in colon cancer DCC gene sequence was enriched with the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 whereas the permissive mark H3K4me3 was absent .
