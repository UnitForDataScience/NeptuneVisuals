Luter ABSTRACTReports of sponge disease are becoming increasingly frequent although almost all instances involve shallow-water tropical species.

Upon collection 5 mm3 pieces of sponge tissue were excised from the lesions of affected sponges diseased the apparently healthy region of diseased sponges non-diseased and from healthy sponge controls healthy.

Here we describe the first disease affecting the deep-water sponge Geodia barretti.

The disease is characterised by brownblack discolouration of the sponge tissue extensive levels of tissue disintegration and increased levels of fouling.Disease prevalence was quantified using video survey transects conducted between 100 and 220 m in Korsfjorden Norway and the microbial communities of healthy and diseased sponges were compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

However the most recent account of sponge disease reported that up to 36 of the Callyspongia Euplacella aff.
