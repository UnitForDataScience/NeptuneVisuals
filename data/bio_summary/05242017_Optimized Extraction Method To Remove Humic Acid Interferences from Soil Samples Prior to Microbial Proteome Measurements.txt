these three fractions of humic substances can be separated by differential solubility humin cannot be dissolved in either alkali or acid solvents while the fulvic acids are soluble in a wide range of ph conditions humic acids are insoluble in strong acids but are soluble under alkali conditions.given the insolubility of humin fraction extractable humic acids and fulvic acids are the main humic interferences that impede proteincharacterization.humic substances are known to interfere with protein extraction purification and identificationquantification.for instance studies have shown that the hydrophobic interactions between humic substances and protein can lead to unwanted modifications thus hampering the correct identification of certain proteins.

additionally considering that it is difficult to quantify peptides in the real soil samples containing humic acids due to spectroscopic interferences and even small amounts of humic acids can easily clog loading columns removing humic acids from the final peptide solutions is highly desirable and enhances sample loading as well as mass-spectrometry measurements thus helping to enhance an unbiased character-ization of the whole proteome.humic acids can be efficiently removed by a combination of ph adjustment and filteringthe complications outlined above prompted a need to implement and optimize a straightforward approach to remove humic acids prior to proteome measurements.

because acid precipitation can separate fulvic acids from humic acids based on their different solubility tca precipitation does help remove fulvic acids from the precipitated protein pellet.

however humic acids that remain insoluble under acidic conditions will be coprecipitated with proteins the ph of 20 tca lysis buffer is 1. although subsequent c18 sep-pak solid-phase extraction can help remove the remaining humic acids materials we have found this step to result in a significant decrease in final peptide concentrations likely due to competitive binding of the humic acids versus peptides for the reversed-phase resin thus limiting the effective enrichment of the peptides.

in each sample these microbial inoculants were also spiked into the normal topsoil to investigate the protein recovery from natural humic-enriched soil.even small amounts of humic acids in proteome samples adversely affect peptide measurementsalthough the effects of humic acids on the identification of targeted proteins via mass spectrometry have been examined before there is limited information on how humic acids impact large-scale proteome identifications via a shotgun proteomics technique.

thus we aimed to design an optimized method to minimize the negative impact of humic substances interference while retaining the extractable peptides.initial work was focused on an experiment designed to identify the minimum amount of humic acids that would cause significant impact on peptide identification however the task of loading humic acids containing peptide samples onto a chromatographic back column is very challenging in that humic acids can easily cause the clogging in the column.

this biased impact of humic acids on detection and identification of 1 5 and 6 ions was likely due to competitive binding of the humic acids with peptides to reversed-phase resin impacting the detection of the least abundant species in this case peptides observed with 1 5 or 6 charges most dramatically.considering the very low amount of identified peptides with5 or 6 charge we chose to examine whether humic acids would suppress singly charged peptides as a function of their hydrophobicity.

to demonstrate that this additional humic acids removal step did not cause sample loss or impact the peptideprotein identification or abundance profiles we evaluated this method by comparing the proteome identification results in three different samples control samples containing only microbial cells humic acids samples containing microbial cells with added commercially available humic acids and natural topsoil samplesinoculated with the same amount of microbial cells.

control sample microbial inoculant pseudomonas putida f1 and humic acids sample microbial inoculant pseudomonas putida f1 added with humic acids were prepared via the previous protocol which used sep-paks to remove humic acids from the peptide solutions.

humic substances are divided into three main fractions humin humic acids has and fulvic acids fas.

the objectives of this study were i to investigate how humic acids impact large-scale peptide identification in shotgun microbial proteomics measurements ii to evaluate a novel approach to remove humic acids and iii to examine whether this new approach impacts protein identification orabundance profiles.

our modified approach employed a ph adjustment to precipitate out the remaining humic acids followed by subsequent removal via a 10 kda molecular-weight spin column filter to remove the interfering humic acids from the final proteolytic peptide sample.
