Although a correlation was observed between the change in gut microbiota and the alterations in phenotypes and biological func- tions of monocytes it is difficult to exclude the possibility that the variation in gut microbiota is directly resulted from RYGB or other factors such as diet since RYGB reduces preference for high-fat food and total caloric intake which was associated with the composition of the gut microbiota 30.In conclusion the results of our study suggest that alterations of the gut bacterial population are strongly correlated with changes in both phenotypes and biological functions of mono- cytes which in turn may contribute to the low- grade chronic inflammation in obese T2D.

Data were presented as Mean - SD and statistical significance was performed using the student's t-test.DiscussionA number of major novel findings in this study were as follows 1 RYGB significantly affected the phenotypes of monocytes in obese T2D with a decrease in the inflammatory subpopula- tions of monocytes 2 In parallel with the alter- ations in the phenotypes the biological func- tions as assessed by monocyte migration and proinflammatory cytokines of the monocytes subsets were also significantly declined after RYGB in the obese T2D patients 3 A significant change of gut microbiota after RYGB was detected mainly with an increase in Bifid- obacterium but a decrease in Escherichia 4 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analy-sis revealed a significant correlation between the shift of gut microbiota and the variations in the frequencies of inflammatory monocyte sub- sets and cytokines.In agreement with a previous report our data showed that RGYB reduced the percentages of both CD14dimCD16 and CD14CD16 mono- cytes in T2D subjects 15 as well as the levels of TNF-a and IL-6 the cytokines associated with insulin resistance in CD14CD16 mono- cytes 16 17.

Differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariat- ric surgery-induced weight loss links with met- abolic and low-grade inflammation markers.

However the link between gut microbiota and circulating monocytes subsets in T2D patients has not been well studied.In the present study we investigated the hypothesis that an alteration in gut microbiota in obese T2D subjects could be responsible for the low- grade chronic inflammation via the activation of monocytes.

Conclusions This study for the first time demonstrated a link between the changes in gut microbiota and alterations in both phenotypes and functions of monocytes after RYGB which may contribute significantly to the low-grade chronic inflammation in obese T2D patients.Keywords Gut microbiota type 2 diabetes monocytes subsets chronic inflammation cytokineIntroductionLow-grade chronic inflammation is character- ized by high levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukins cytokines and C-reactive protein and is considered one of the major traits in Type 2 diabetes T2D and obesity 1.

RYGB also resulted in a shift of gut microbiota in the obese T2D patients.
