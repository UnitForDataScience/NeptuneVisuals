Although a large number of contigs were present in all gut compartments 601 each possessed a number of unique contigs SC 172 MC 333 HC 73 with the midgut containing the largest number of unique contigs A.All compartments were dominated by the Caudovirales order of dsDNA viruses and most of the Caudovirales contigs were nearly twice asFig.

While this study does not provide a complete picture of the Ciona gut virome due to the exclusion of viral contigs  5 kb and the small sample size data reported here serve as a foundation for understanding viral dynamics within the Ciona gut.

Consistent with the high number of viral contigs unique to the midgut the midgut also possessed the largest number of distinct bac- terial OTUs compared to the other two compartments C. The number of reads from each compartment matching the top 50 viral contigs B or bacterial OTUs D from all three compart- ments were mapped to assess compartmentalization of viruses and bacteria.

The Mimiviridae family of giant viruses which infect the genus Acanthamoeba were also less abundant in cleared gut samplescompared to uncleared.Evidence for viral and bacterial compartmentalization in the Ciona gutTaxonomic comparisons of the contigs highlighted both similarities and differences between gut compartments A.

The top 10 viral contigs in each group shared sequence identity with phages infecting described mem- bers of the Ciona core microbiome including Flavobacteria Shewanella Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio .In an effort to distinguish between Ciona-associated viruses and those that originate from dietary contents the 2015 trisected gut compartments were either sampled immediately uncleared stomach SF midgut MF and hindgut HF or after the animal was allowed to clear its gut contents cleared stomach SC midgut SC and hindgut HC.

The Persicivirga phages P12024L and P12024S infect bacteria that degrade polysaccharides from green algae  and while contigs related to these phages were present in all gut samples they were markedly higher in the uncleared samples perhaps due to the fact that Ciona eat fine detritus and phytoplankton .

The largest circular contig Node 1 detected initially within the MF sample 114157 bp yielded predicted proteins related to Cellulophaga phages which infect algae-degrading bacteria and the absence of these sequences in the cleared samples may indicate thorough purging of dietary material.Table 2Relative abundance of all circular contigs from the Ciona virome and their closest BLASTx match in the NR database as determined by the majority of ORFs.

The observation that Ciona maintains a virome with many predicted hosts matching mem- bers of the core microbiome and a prevalence of prophages indicates a role for phages as major players in shaping host-associated bacterial communities within the dynamic gut ecosystem of these animals.Materials and methodsTissue collectionsAdult Ciona were wild-harvested in San Diego California USA and shipped overnight to the laboratory in Florida.

Venn diagrams were generated using theVennDiagram package  through R v 3.3.2 software  to display the overlap of contigs in dif- ferent gut compartments using the mapping data from Read2- RefMapper.VirSorter also detected linear contigs with matching k-mers at the ends and assumed them to be complete circular genomes.
