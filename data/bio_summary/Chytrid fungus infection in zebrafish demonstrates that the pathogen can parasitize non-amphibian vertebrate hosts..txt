We show that different stages of Bd infection can be observed on zebrafish larvae using histopathology and confocal microscopy alongside symptoms of infection that are comparable to those observed in amphibians.These results show that zebrafish larvae undergo an infection process similar to that of Bd's native amphibian hosts highlighting the utility of zebrafish larvae as an important model to study this emerging panzootic infectious disease.ResultsBd infection of zebrafish larvae.

Thus a zebrafishlarvae infection model would present a novel opportunity to study pathogenesis and innate immune responses during Bd infection in vivo.Here we tested whether zebrafish larvae can act as carriers of Bd by developing a 3-day dose-dependent model in which infection can be detected and quantified.

These results show that zebrafish larvae undergo an infection process similar to that of amphibians and that Bd infection of zebrafish can be powerful model system to study the invasion and proliferation of Bd in vivo.DiscussionOur study shows that Bd is able to infect and multiply on zebrafish larvae treated with antibiotics in a dose dependent manner that mimics the process of infection seen in amphibians.

We also show that infection phenotypes fin erosion cell apoptosis and muscle degeneration are direct symptoms of infection.

An unexamined factor that may confound all of these studies is whether commensal bacteria either interact synergistically with Bd to exacerbate infection through dysbiosis or rather protect against infection through the production of antimicrobial compounds.

Recent studies have uncovered host immune responses of Bd infection in amphibians though most of this work focused on adaptive immunity despite research suggesting an important roleof the innate immune system especially at the early stages of infection.

To investigate infection burden we quantified the amount of Bd DNA on infected larvae using quantitative PCR qPCR an assay typically used to detect Bd infection in vivo using swabs or toeclips.

To visualize Bd infection in larvae weperformed histopathology using methods commonly employed to confirm infection in amphibians.

Takentogether these results show that zebrafish larvae can be infected with Bd in the presence of broad spectrum antibiotics and that Bd infection of larvae resembles that of amphibians.Symptoms of Bd infection in zebrafish larvae.

Moreover CFW-positive punctae colocalized with blister-like structures on eroded muscle of infected larvae 2e suggesting that both CFW-positive punctae and blistering of skin are symptoms of infection by Bd.Consequence of Bd infection on zebrafish larvae host tissue.
