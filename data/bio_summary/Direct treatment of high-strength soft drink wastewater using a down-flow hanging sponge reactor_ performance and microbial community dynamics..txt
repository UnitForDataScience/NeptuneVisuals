.In 1997 a post-treatment process or so-called down- flow hanging sponge DHS reactor was developed Agrawal et al.

In comparison to traditional activated sludge process the operation and maintenance cost for DHS is relatively low Tandukar et al.

In general the combination of anaerobic processes and DHS reactors was reported to achieve at least 90 of organic removal in most studies El-Kamah et al.

So far only limited studies have attempted to use DHS reactor as a standalone process to treat low-strength 1000 mgL COD wastewater Fleifle et al.

Compared with a previous anaerobic process used to treat the same synthetic wastewater the DHS reactor in this study achieved a compatible organic removal efficiency  98 at the same HRT 1.5 days Narihiro et al.

In addition the DHS used here did not require extra efforts that were needed in operating an anaerobic process such as main- taining anaerobic conditions and mesophilic operation tem- perature providing recirculation and treating off-gas Bal and Dhagat  Bandara et al.

In this study theamount of retained biomass recorded was 46.8 g-VSSL- sponge at an OLR of 4.9 kg CODm3 per day and these two numbers were higher than reported 12.8 g-VSSL-sponge and2.9 CODm3 per day respectively in a DHS reactor that treats agricultural drainage wastewater Fleifle et al.

In ad- dition it was observed that the retained biomass in a DHS reactor treating gray wastewater increased when the OLR was increased Tawfik et al.

This study and other stud- ies all suggested that the upper part of the DHS reactor con- tains higher retained biomass than the lower part due to higher OLR Fleifle et al.

Onodera et al.. Once the retained biomass was developed DHS reac- tor could effectively treat high-strength wastewater.The feasibility of DHS in treating the high-strength waste- water here was also related to the organic composition of the wastewater i.e.
