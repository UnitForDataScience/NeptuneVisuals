Compared with a previous anaerobic process used to treat the same synthetic wastewater the DHS reactor in this study achieved a compatible organic removal efficiency  98 at the same HRT 1.5 days Narihiro et al.

The effluent nitro- gen species removal efficiency in reactors in A and B did not correlate with the TOC removal efficiency.Vertical profiles of reactor performance in the DHS reactorsChanges of TOC nitrogen species and TSSVSS along the reactor height were only determined on day 666 when reactor A became stable and reactor B just suffered from sloughing Fig.

Despite the efficiency fluctuation in reactors A and B reactor 2 could consistently achieve an overall efficien- cy at 98 from day 300 and guaranteed the TOC of the efflu- ent from reactor 2 consistently at 20 mgL.Correlations between TOC removal efficiency and related parametersSpearman correlation test was used to correlate key operation parameters with the TOC removal efficiency.

In general the combination of anaerobic processes and DHS reactors was reported to achieve at least 90 of organic removal in most studies El-Kamah et al.

By contrast anaerobic processes have been widely applied to treat high-organic-strength wastewater primarily because of their characteristics including low oper- ation cost high organic loading tolerance low excessive sludge yield and reasonable treatment efficiency around 80 COD removal Kalyuzhnyi et al.

As higher SS was correlated with lower organic removal efficiency losing these populations due to sloughing events from the upper part of the DHS system could lead to poor organic removal effi- ciency.

1 The schematic diagram of the DHS reactors with plots of TOC removal efficiency recorded in each reactor.

Based on the Shapiro- Wilk tests the distribution of TOC removal efficiency of both reactors during the entire operation did not follow a normal distribution and the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests further verified that these two efficiency data sets could be considered as nearly identical to each other.Occasionally poor TOC removal performance with reac- tors A and B was observed at different time points due to primarily biomass sloughing.

.In 1997 a post-treatment process or so-called down- flow hanging sponge DHS reactor was developed Agrawal et al.
