A and B NaAc C and D NaP E and F NaB.demonstrated that SCFAs have a therapeutic potential to protect against various inflammatory diseases in animal models e. In several studies SCFAs inhibited production of pro-inflammatory factors in neutrophils monocytes and macrophages e. SCFAs prevented LPS-induced production of TNF-a and IFN-g in human peripheral mononuclear cells  and of TNF-a IL 1b and IL-6 through inhibition of the p65 protein translocation to the nu- cleus in RAW264.7 cells .

Furthermore SCFA-mediated inhibition of MCP-1 expression was significantly blocked by siRNA- induced gene silencing of GPR41 and GPR43.In conclusion SCFAs lowered TNF-a-induced MCP-1 expression by reducing phosphorylation of p38and JNK in a GPR4143-dependent manner in HRCEs suggesting that SCFA modification may be a new therapeutic tool for preventing progression of renal inflammation and fibrosis.c 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.IntroductionShort-chain fatty acids SCFAs have six or less carbons and consist mainly of propionate acetate and butyrate.

Considering the anti-inflammatory ef- fects of SCFAs in several inflammatory diseases SCFAs may atten- uate MCP-1 production via GPR41 or GPR43 activation in renal tubular cells.

C and D. In whole-cell lysates from confluent HRCEs GPR41 and GPR43 proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.27 at 1000 mM F. These results suggested that all three SCFAs significantly reduced the expression of MCP-1 in HRCEs.SCFAs decreased TNF-a-stimulated expression of MCP-1 in a GPR41-or GPR43-dependent manner in HRCEsNext we examined whether SCFAs reduced TNF-a-stimulated expression of MCP-1 via GPR41 and GPR43.

As a result we detected marked decreases in GPR41 and GPR43 mRNA levels in the HRCEs treated with siRNA against GPR41 and GPR43 respectively G and H. The simultaneous silencing of GPR41 and GPR43 in HRCEs blocked the NaP-induced suppression of TNF- a-induced MCP-1 expression I and J.SCFAs decreased TNF-a-induced MCP-1 expression by suppressing p38 MAPK and JNKTo further investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibi- tory effects of SCFAs on TNF-a-induced MCP-1 expression we attempted first to clarify the signal cascade whereby TNF-a induces MCP-1 expression and then to assess the effects of SCFAs via GPR41 and GPR43 on the cascade in HRCEs.

In contrast little is known about the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs on renal cells.In this study we showed that all three types of SCFAs reduced TNF- a-induced production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine MCP-1 in HRCEs.One of the most important findings in the current study was that sodium propionate reduced TNF-a-stimulated expression of MCP-1 dependent on GPR41 and GPR43 in HRCEs.

Activation of GPR41 and GPR43 and inhibition of HDAC an epigenetic modifier are generally considered to underlie the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs e. Our study showed that this mechanism is sup- ported via GPR activation although we did not analyze the effect of SCFAs on HDAC activity.

SCFAs are newly identified as endogenous ligands of two orphan G protein-coupled receptors GPR41 and GPR43 which have the potential to modulate inflam- mation.

This study aimed at investigating whether SCFAs activate GPR41 and GPR43 and thereby exert anti-inflammatory effects in human renal cortical epithelial cells HRCEs as a main component of kidney tissue.Immunohistochemical analyses of human renal biopsy specimens revealed the expression of GPR41 and GPR43 protein in the distal renal tubules and collecting tubules.
