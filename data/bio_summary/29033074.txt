It is well known that several different bacterial groups contaminate meat during the slaughtering processes although the complexity of the mi- crobiota of meat is reduced when it is sold due to the selective pressure determined by the storage temperature the packaging atmospheres andthe initial antimicrobial treatments  .

Together the microbiological and VOC profiles depicted an acceptable meat quality of the beefsteaks over the entire storage time  regardless of the AO and EW treatments which did not therefore seem to have had any impact on the initial microbiological situation of the beefsteaks or on the subsequent fate of the microbial counts throughout VP storage.Previous DNA-based HTS investigations highlighted a limited mi-crobial complexity of the final meat portions in comparison to the in- itial condition of the carcasses cuts and slaughter environments due to6 Methyl 5 heptene 2 on2 Penten 1 ol2 Nonenal2 Octenal HexanalFuran 2 pentyl1 Penten 3 ol2.3 OctanedionePentanolOcten 1 ol1 Octen 3 ol Acetoin1 Octanol Nonanal Acetone Octanal Butyrolactone Butanoic acid1 Butanol 3 methyl Hexanoic acid Ethanol 2 butoxy EthanolHeptanal Acetic acid Ethyl Acetate Nonanoic acid Octanoic Acid Ethyl lactate Benzaldehyde1 HexanolFig.

The main problem faced by the meat processing industry is the necessity of efficiently contrasting the de- velopment of species capable of producing the volatile organic com- pounds VOCs that are associated with unpleasant odors  .Accordingly the treatment of meat with adequate preservation technologies before the being packaged may represent a feasible solu- tion to extend its shelf-life and thus to avoid product losses.

This alcohol confers a pungent ethereal odor and it has been associated with the metabolic activities of P. phosphoreum in MAP packaged pork meat   although it has so far mainly been associated with the metabolic activity of Enterobacteriaceae and LAB species in VP spoiled meat .

This approach may result in a more reliable correlation between taxa and volatile compounds related to meat spoilage  .Therefore the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of AO and EW treatments on the complexity and dynamics of the potential active microbiota of beefsteaks and their associated volatilome during storage at 4 degC and in vacuum packaging conditions.Materials and methodsTreatments with aqueous AO ozone and electrolyzed water EWThe studied steaks weighing about 200 g each were obtained from three different batches of tender boneless beef 24 h after slaughtering.

Samplings were performed before the treatments day 0 and during storage of vacuum-packed beefsteaks at 4 degC for 15 days.

However none of them was associated with a specific treatment .DiscussionThis study has investigated the microbiota of VP beefsteaks treated with electrolyzed water and aqueous ozone and it offers a detailed view of the evolution of the potentially active community after treat- ments thanks to the use of the RNA-based HTS of the 16S rRNA and headspace analysis of the VOCs.A progressive growth of all the microbial groups considered during the storage time was observed with the LAB population taking over after the 5th day probably due to the limited oxygen condition estab- lished after the treatments and resulting in an increased final acidity as can be expected in VP meat .

It is therefore possible to state that the presence of oxygen inside packaging favors the predominance of L. gasicomitatum compared to the Lactobacillus and Lactococcus species at the end of meat storage   unlike what was observed in the here examined VP beefsteaks.

The development of the potentially active microbiota and the associated volatilome were followed over 15 days of storage under refrigerated conditions 4 degC in order to define the potential long- term effects of the treatments and storage condition on microbiota.The targeted RNA-based amplicon sequencing identified Pseudomonas fragi as the most frequent species before and after the treatments with AO and EW as well as in the untreated control.
