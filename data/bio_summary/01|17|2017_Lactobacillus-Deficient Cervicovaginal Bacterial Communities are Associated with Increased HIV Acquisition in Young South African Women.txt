However the depth of these studies has been limited by the use of Gram-stained vaginal smears to assess the genital bacterial composition and by investigation of sex-worker and clinical cohorts not representative of the average healthy female population.The recent development of high throughput sequencing technologies to characterize the human microbiome has significantly improved our understanding of the role of the microbiome in diseases such as obesity inflammatory bowel disease colorectal cancer Marchesi et al.
