Special functions include the role of flavonoids in the attraction of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and root nodulation and the interference of root exudates with bacterial quorum sensing.Metabolic breakdown and modification of specialized metabolites by microbes in the endosphere.VOCs emitted by rhizobacteria and ectomycorrhizal fungi effecting root morphology and plant immunity.Exudates strigolactones promote root-mycorrhizal fungi interactions arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus not shown.Attractive and growth inhibitory functions of volatile and non-volatile specialized metabolites on root microbial pathogens.Direct repellent deterrent or attractive effects of exudates and VOCs on root herbivores and plant parasites.Attraction of insect parasites entomopathogenic nematodes by root-derived VOCs.causing the disruption of carotenoid biosynthesis and eventually plant death Meazza et al.

Sorgoleone 2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3- 80Z 110Z-80110140-pentadecatriene-p-benzoquinone and the sorgoleone-like compound 5-ethoxysorgoleone accu- mulate in the form of oily droplets at the tip of S. bicolor root hairs implying an important role of this root part in sorgoleone production and secretion Chang et al.

In a second step additional selective factors dependent on the host plant genotype generate a more distinct microbial community on the immediate root surface and within the root.

Similarly the volatile compound 6-pentyl-2H- pyran-2-one derived from a root-associate fungus in the genus Trichoderma inhibits primary root growth and induces lateral root formation Garnica-Vergara et al.

Herbivory can stimulate an increase in root glucosinolate levels as was for instance observed for indole glucosino- lates in B. nigra roots upon feeding by the cabbage root fly Delia radicum Van Dam and Raaijmakers 2006.

Another example are isoflavonoids that are exuded by root nodules of clover and serve as attractants to the clover root weevil Sitona Lepidus John- son et al.

root hairs and are secreted from the root forming visible golden-colored droplets Dayan et al.

These metabolites were found to accumulate in the sloughed border cells at the root tip and in lipid bodies in the epidermal cells of the young root.

Along the length of a root flavonoids are often found at the root tip region Hawes et al.

Interestingly the same authors revealed that simple triterpenoids such as b-amyrin impact root epidermal cell patterning and thus bear additional functions in root growth and development Kemen et al.
