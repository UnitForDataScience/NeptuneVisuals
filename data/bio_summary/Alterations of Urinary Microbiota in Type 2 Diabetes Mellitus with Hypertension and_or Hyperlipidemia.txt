The aim of this study was to characterize the urinary microbiota in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus only and those with diabetes plus hypertension andor hyperlipidemia and to explore whether the composition of the urinary microbiota is affected by fasting blood glucose blood pressure and blood lipids.

The insights from this study could be used to develop microbiota-based treatment for comorbid conditions including urinary tract infections in those with diabetes.Keywords type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension hyperlipidemia Lactobacillus Proteobacteria urinary microbiotaINTRODUCTIONThe number of people around the world with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 World Health Organization 2016.

Women undergoing surgery for stress urinary incontinence have been shown to have increased urinary bacterial diversity and this diversity has been shown to be affected by hormone status there were differences between premenopausal women and postmenopausal women with or without current exogenous hormone use body mass index and the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence Thomas-White et al.

The beads now released from the DNA were collected with the magnet The DNA-containing supernatant was transferred to a clean tube.

The main urinary bacteria in healthy women are Lactobacillus Prevotella and Gardnerella Siddiqui et al.
