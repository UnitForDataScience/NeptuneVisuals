Here we show that both traits are supported bya metabolically rich gut transcriptome producing a diverse set of digestive enzymes AMPs and lysozymes that may help to digest and preserve the carcass surface as well as a consistent bacterial and fungal gut microbiota that is transmitted to the larvae through anal secretions applied to the carcass surface.We identified AMPs and lysozymes that are differentially expressed in different regions of the gut corresponding to their presumed or confirmed presence in anal and oral secretions.

The diversity of AMPs and lysozymes their differential expression in the N. vespilloides gut and their possible involvement in carcass sanitization regulation of gut microbiota andor the supplementation of digestive enzymes highlights the evolutionary plasticity of N. vespilloides immune responses in relation to context-specific environments such as the presence of carcass and offspring.The differential enrichment of GO terms in the N. vespilloides gut transcriptomes suggests that region-specific metabolic processes may contribute to meat digestion nutrient transport and detoxification 1.

Quality control measures including the filtering of high-quality reads based on the score given in fastq files removal of reads containing primeradapter sequences and trimming of read length were carried out using CLC Genomics Workbench v8.1 The de novo transcriptome assemblies of the beetle and carcass samples were prepared using the same softwareby combining all seven N. vespilloides tissue samples or the single carcass sample respectively and selecting the presumed optimal consensus transcriptome as previously described.

Finally we analysed transcripts from the feeding cavity of the carcass the portion of the carcass where larvae reside and feed to determine which microbes were active on the carcass and to investigate their potential contribution to carcass utilization.ResultsMorphology of the N. vespilloides alimentary canal.

The RNA was extracted independently from two carcass samples using TRIsure BiolineBerlin-Brandenburg Germany according to the manufacturer's instructionsfollowed by DNase treatment Turbo DNase Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA and was further purified using RNA Clean and Concentrator 5 Zymo Research Irvine CA USA.

However little is known about the spatial distribution of different microbial species in the gut and their impact on the activity of the anal and oral burying beetle's secretions.In this study we focus on the carrion beetle Nicrophorusvespilloides Herbst and investigate the role of the beetle gut tissue and its microbiota in 1 the digestion of carrion 2 the detoxification of microbial toxins on carrion and 3 the chemical preservation of carcass during breeding and protection from antagonists and competitors.

The prevalence of Yarrowia transcripts on the beetle-utilized carcass surface 7 confirmed that the yeasts are metabolically active on the carcass and are resident rather than transient members of the beetle microbiota and the carcass microbial community.

The heat map shows the abundance of bacterial taxa log-transformed with warm colours indicating high abundance cold colours indicating low abundance and black denoting absence.Taxonomy was assigned to representative sequences using the RDP classifier implemented in QIIME and the phylogeny was generated in FastTree based on an alignment produced using SINA and ARB.

Second sequences that did not retrieve BLASTx hits were searched again using BLASTn against the NCBI nrnucleotide database using an E-value cutoff of 10 - 10.

Digital gene expression analysis was carried out using CLC Genomics Workbench v8.1 to generate BAM mapping files and QSeq Software DNAStar Inc. Madison WI USA was then used to remap the Illumina reads from all five samples onto the reference transcriptome followed by counting the sequences to estimate expression levels using previously described parameters for read mapping and normal- ization.
