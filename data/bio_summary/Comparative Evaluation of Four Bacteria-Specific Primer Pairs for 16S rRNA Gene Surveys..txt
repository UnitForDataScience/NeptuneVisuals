This suggests the high utility of primer pair 341f785r for soil and plant-associated bacterial microbiome studies.Keywords pyrosequencing 16S rRNA gene sequence primers microbial communities soil explosives contaminationINTRODUCTIONHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing of taxonomic marker genes has become a widely used technique to obtain information on the microbial community composition diversity and richness at high resolution in diverse environmental samples Caporaso et al.

The TNT-contaminated soil had an average pH of 6.1 moisture content of 66.2 conductivity of 340 uS per cm cation exchange capacity of 9.2 Meq per 100 g dry weight using the ammonium acetate method at pH 7 Chapman1965 and 3.1 mg organic labile carbon per kg dry weight soil measured using the permanganate oxidation method Culman et al.

Previously primer pair 68f518r was used to amplify iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria in soil but it has not been extensively validated as a primer for soil microbial community characterization McAllister et al.

With respect to TNT-contaminated soil some of the groups detected in this study are in agreement with the results from clone libraries and DGGE-analyses of TNT-contaminated soil in the UK Travis et al.

This information has led to significantly increased understanding of the effect of natural or human- induced disturbance on soil and plant-associated microbial communities Hart et al.

Soil bacterial communities have therefore been the subject of bioremediation studies aiming to optimize bacterial community function for accelerating biodegradation and soil remediation Yang et al.

In addition modifications in the primer pair to reduce chloroplast amplification can also introduce new biases against bacterial groups which are abundant in soil Lundberg et al.

2009.Rarefaction curves were constructed for each sample individually as well as per primer pair and soil type using QIIME Caporaso et al.

A higher prevalence of Gamma- and Alpha-proteobacteria has been reported in a hydrocarbon contaminated soil Yergeau et al.

Importantly we detected recently that the soil bacterium Raoultella Enterobacteriaceae has the ability to liberate nitrite from TNT for growth catalyzed by a protein of the Old Yellow Enzyme family N-ethylmaleimide reductase Thijs et al.
