while there is in- sufficient evidence to show that the association between mi- crobial exposure during pregnancy and decreased allergic dis- ease in the offspring is mediated by these immune parameters in the newborn it is clear that infants of mothers exposed to a farming environment display different innate immune gene expressions  as well as increased number and efficiency of regulatory t cells .mechanisms by which the maternal microbiome during pregnancy may influence fetal immune developmentalignment between maternal and infant immunityalignment between maternal and infant immunity may be one mechanism linking the maternal microbiome to the offspring's risk of allergic disease.

does the mother ready thedeveloping infant for the specific environment they will be born into and are the changes in the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy  relevant to healthy fetal immune development the aim of this review is to con- sider current thinking and evidence regarding the mecha- nisms by which the maternal gut microbiome during preg- nancy influences fetal immune development and the po- tential relevance of these pathways to the prevention of allergic disease.epidemiological evidence linking the maternal microbiome and allergic disease in the offspringthere is substantial evidence that exposure to a farming envi- ronment during early life is associated with diverse bacterial experience and reduced risk of allergic sensitisation and asth- ma .

more spe- cifically it is an intriguing possibility that the maternal microbiome may provide immunostimulatory components such as hexa-acylated lps in combination with immunoreg- ulatory microbial metabolites such as scfas to promote treg development and immune tolerance in the developing fetus.manipulating the maternal microbiome during pregnancy to prevent allergic disease and asthmagiven the increasing evidence that infant gut microbial com- position plays a pivotal role in the development of immune responses probiotic andor prebiotic supplementation during pregnancy and infancy has been investigated as an approach to modify early gut colonisation and prevent allergic diseases.

moreover environmental exposures provide only a proxy for the maternal and infant microbiome and there are current- ly no published human studies which enable independent evaluation of the importance of prenatal maternal and postna- tal infant microbiomes to the prevention of allergic disease.a range of studies have established clear links between differences in innate and adaptive immunity at birth andsubsequent allergic disease and asthma which suggests that in utero immune development is likely to be relevant to the prevention of allergy and asthma.

the mecha- nisms by which the maternal microbiome influences the developing fetal immune system include alignment be- tween the maternal and infant regulatory immune status and transplacental passage of microbial metabolites and igg.

it is well recognised that the infant's microbiome during early postnatal life plays a central role in healthy immune de- velopment but there is also mounting evidence that the maternal microbiome during pregnancy has a profound impact on fetal immune development and in turn the in- fant's predisposition to allergic disease and asthma.

further to this maternal antibodies enhanced the retention and trans- mission of targeted microbial molecules produced by the e. coli and these molecules were responsible for the increase in offspring innate leukocytes .early exposure to lipopolysaccharide endotoxin producing bacteriathe maternal intestinal microbiome may also confer protec- tion against allergic disease and asthma in the offspring via tlr-dependent pathways .

until recently maternal igg transfer during gestation had only been linked to fetal humoral immu- nity but there is now good evidence that maternal igg also plays a crucial in fetal innate immune development .

there has been a vast amount of work done on the infant microbiome but the maternal microbiome during pregnancy remains relatively underinvestigated particularly in humans and may be of fun- damental importance to the prevention of allergic disease and asthma in the modern environment.open access this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4 .0 international license http creativecommons.orglicensesby4.0 which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appro- priate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.referenceshooper lv littman dr macpherson aj 2012 interactions be- tween the microbiota and the immune system.

this gap in knowl- edge provides an exciting opportunity for new studies to de- velop novel and sophisticated strategies for restoring a healthy microbiome.conclusionsa range of epidemiological and mechanistic evidence sup- ports the contention that the composition and metabolic prod- ucts of the maternal microbiome play a key role in program- ming tolerogenic immune phenotypes in the offspring at birth in turn decreasing the risk of allergic disease and asthma.

given dramatic advances in our ability to character- ise the composition and metabolic activity of the microbiome studies are required that link direct measures of the maternal microbiome in humans with immune phenotypes in the off- spring and subsequent allergic outcomes.

however the relationship between lps exposure and allergic diseases is complex with some epidemiological studies finding that en- vironments with high levels of endotoxin are associated with decreased allergic disease   while others link endotox- in exposure to increased allergic disease .

most probiotic prevention studies have involved infants at increased risk of allergic disease due to presence of allergic disease in a first-degree relative so it remains uncer- tain whether probiotic supplementation will be effective ininfants without a family history of allergic disease.

there are currently no equivalent data from human studies.maternal igg and fetal innate immune developmentmaternal igg may play a key role in mediating the association between the maternal microbiome and fetal immune develop- ment.
