to prevent inappropriate t cell activity coinhibitory signals can induce t cell apoptosis or t cell exhaustion which is a temporary inhibition of t cell activity.cancer cells can take advantage of this system to evade immune surveillance.

il-4 receptors il-4r are also overexpressed in multiple cancer types including gbm rendering them as a conceivable cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets.for instance it has been shown that elevated il-4 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma iscorrelated with greater recurrence and lower survival.

it inhibits cd4 and cd8 t cell activation allowing gliomas to avoid immune-mediated attack.in mouse models of gbm pd-1 blockade led to better t cell infiltration into cancer tissue and a subsequent in- crease in survival.anti-pd-1 drugs are being tested clinically in patients with gbm.

phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced solid cancers are ongoing nct02817633.lag-3 is a membrane molecule expressed on t cells that bind to major histocompatibility complex class ii re- ceptors to decrease t cell activation.in addition lag-3 has also been shown tomediate regulatory t cell treg functions in downregulating the immune system.

this finding suggests that tim-3 plays a role in t cell exhaustion thereby allowing can- cers to escape immune-mediated cell death.

this technology can be used to study minute differences in cell phenotypes allowing more precise understanding of cancer pathogenesis.to assess for immune cell activation enzyme-linked immunospot can be used to detect cytokine production.

although identification of novel biomarkers may improve and help direct treatment of patients with gbm the next step is to explore the role of biomarkers in precision medicine and selection of specific immunotherapeutic drugs in an individualized manner.gitr glucocorticoid-induced tnfr-related gene ihc immunohistochemistryil interleukinil-4r interleukin 4 receptoril-13r interleukin 13 receptorlag-3 lymphocyte activation gene 3mrna messenger rnansclc non-small-cell lung cancer pcr polymerase chain reaction pd-1 programmed death 1pd-l1 programmed death ligand 1 pd-l2 programmed death ligand 2 tgf-b transforming growth factor b til tumor-infiltrating lymphocytestim-3 t cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3tmz temozolomidetnf-a tumor necrosis factor atreg regulatory t celldepartment of neurosurgery johns hopkins university school of medicine baltimore maryland usato whom correspondence should be addressed michael lim m.d.e-mail citation world neurosurg.

when anti-ctla-4 was used with either gm-csf expressing whole glioma cell vaccination or intratumoral il-12 survival was greater than with ctla-4 monotherapy.these successes in the preclinical setting support the transition to clinical trials in patients with gbm.despite the promising role of ctla-4 as an effective cancer immunotherapeutictarget its status as a gbm prognostic biomarker is largely unknown.

considering that not all patients respond to anti-pd-1 or anti-ctla-4 therapy more studies have concentrated on alternative checkpoint molecules and combination therapies.tim-3 is a surface protein expressed on th1 cells that modulates immune sup- pression by binding to galectin 9 its ligand to induce t cell apoptosis.in murine models of multiple solid cancers including melanoma breast cancer and colon cancer the expression of tim-3 was found to be increased along with pd-1 in tils with features of exhaustion.

as a result tim-3 is another po- tential therapeutic target.in clinical studies tim-3 expression on tils has been shown to be increased in tumor samples of patients with melanoma nsclc and renal cell cancer.

the proportion of tils with tim-3 and pd-1 coexpression in patients with renal cell carcinoma is also positively correlated with more aggressive disease greater relapse and worse survival.

a few patients had severe adverse effects during treatment with ly2109761 monotherapy 7.7 whereas most patients treated with both ly2109761 and lomustine had severe reactions 88.5. more research is required to establish the clinical significance of these drugs and to determine their therapeutic efficacy.

a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors suggested therapeutic efficacy with tolerable toxicity.comparedwithotherangiogenicmarkers cd105 has a significantly better correlation with prognosis in patients with gbm with lower cd105 expression implicating longer survival.it is also found at a significantly higher density ingbm tissue than in normal brain tissue.
