non-colonized infants born to colo- nized mothers received colostrum with significantly higher siga than colonized motherinfant pairs for stiii and stv when adjusted for maternal age maternal weight maternal anemia and gestation p  0.0001 .siga in colostrum is associated with absence of infant colonization at days 60-89compared to infants who remained colonized on day 60-89 non-colonized infants received higher siga concentrations against stv in colostrum p  0.001. there were no infants who remained colonized with stia and only three infants remainedcolonized with stiii.

as shown in  infants who cleared colonization between birth and days 60-89 n  27 received colostrum with higher concentrations of tnfail-6 and tgf-b1 p  0.01 than infants who acquired coloniza-tion between birth and day 60-89 aor 2.4 1.2-5.0 p  0.02. infants who were persistently colonized n  7 received higher concentrations of ifn-g in colostrum than infants who acquired colonization n  28 aor 5.1 2.4-11.0 p  0.001. there was no association between other cytokines in breastmilk and infantcolonization at day 60-89 .discussionthe results from our large cohort of motherinfant pairs show for the first time that siga and key immunomodulatory cytokines tnfa il-6 il-10 and tgf-b in colostrum may be associated with infant gbs colonization acquisition and clearance up to 3 months of life.few studies have focused on the relationship between siga in breast milk and infant colonization with potential pathogens.

anti-gbs secretory iga bound to the surface of whole bacteria was assessed by flow cytometry and a panel of 12 cytokines quantified by mesoscale discovery in colostrum breastmilk and serum.results compared with infants receiving low anti-gbs siga in colostrum infants receiving high anti-gbs siga were at decreased risk of gbs colonization for serotypes iii and v. infants colonized at day 6 were twice as likely to receive colostrum with high tgf-b1 tnfa il10 and il-6 compared to uncolonized infants.

in addition non-colonized infants at 60-89 days were more likely to have higher antibody concentrations in cord blood and in infant serum p  0.001. there was a positive correlation between siga in colostrum and complement-mediated antibody deposition in cord blood and in infant serum found in the main study r  0.67 p  0.0001 .cytokines in colostrum breastmilk and infant serumsignificantly higher concentrations of tnfa ifng il-1b il-2 il-4 il-6 il-10 il-12 il-13 p  0.0001 for all were found in colostrum in comparison with breastmilk cord blood or infantserum at days 60-89. breastmilk had lower concentrations of tnfa il-1b il-6 and il-13 p  0.0001 than infant serum.

680 colostrum and 750 breastmilk samples were available for analysis.we examined the presence of gbs in breastmilk from all 750 women and found 10 to be gbs colonized in breastmilk.relationship between siga in breastmilk and maternal gbs-colonization statusoverall 324680 47.6 colostrum samples had detectable siga against any gbs st. there was no significant difference in siga concentration between non-colonized mothers and those colonized with sts ia gbs  mother fi-c 1300 1000-1765gbs-mother 1500 1000-1886 p  0.3 iii gbs  1713 1545-4837 gbs-1995 1798-2223 p  0.3 or v gbs  20891883-5896 gbs-2691 2426-2985 p  0.8.there was no difference in iga antibody concentrationsfound between those women colonized in breastmilk and those uncolonized.relationship between siga in colostrum and maternalinfant colonization on day 6152 infants 152680 22.4 were colonized both at birth and on day 6 of life.

persistently colonized infants were defined as infants where nasopharyn- geal and rectal swabs at birth day 6 and day 60-89 were all gbs positive.resultsthe maternal gbs colonization rate was 32 n  237 with 21 of infants colonized at birth n  158 20 colonized at day 6 n  152 and 7 of infants colonized on day 60-89 n  50 .

infants receiving high colostral tgf-b1 tnfa and il-6 had two-fold enhanced gbs clearance between birth and day 89.conclusion our results suggest that the infant gbs colonization risk diminishes with increasing anti-gbs siga antibody in breastmilk and that key maternally derived cyto- kines might contribute to protection against infant colonization.

infants who cleared colonization between birth and day 6 also received colostrum with higher concentra- tions of siga than those infants who remained colonized for stv .

multivariate logisticalregression adjusted for other cytokines showed that colonized infants were more likely to receive colostrum with high concen- trations of tgf-b il-10 tnfa and il-6 than non-colonized infants aor 3.2 1.8-9.2 p  0.03. there was no association with any other cytokine at day 6.relationship between cytokines in colostrum and acquisition and clearance of infant colonization between birth and days 60-89median concentrations of ten cytokines in colostrum were com- pared for all four motherinfant groups.

there have been few studies of the effect of breastmilk antibody on infant colonization but a small study of breastfed infants challenged postnatally with non-pathogenic e. coli demonstrated a reduc- tion in colonization with high breastmilk siga concentrations  whilst studies of h. influenzae  s. pneumoniae  and n. meningitides  demonstrate that increasing antibody concentrations in serum are associated with reduced risk of pharyngeal colonization with these bacteria.

associations between cytokines in colostrum breastmilk cord blood and infant serum are highlighted in .relationship between cytokines in colostrum and early infant colonizationinfants who were still colonized on day 6 of life were more likely to receive colostrum with high concentrations of tgf-b1or 1.45 1.1-1.9 p  0.02 il-10 2.8 1.1-7.5 p  0.05tnfa 2.4 1.1-5.0 p  0.02 and il-6 2.4 1.2-5.0 p  0.02than non-colonized infants .

however we have demonstrated that infants who remained non-colonized received high concentrations ofsiga in colostrum and high functional antibody in cord blood and infant serum  suggesting a role for both systemic and mucosal antibody in preventing gbs colonization.the low numbers of motherinfant pairs colonized with gbs stia and iii precluded detailed analysis of these gbs serotypes which are important causes of infant disease in many countries and represent two of the serotypes being targeted by the current vaccine candidates.

in future studies it might be possible to consent for longitudinal swabbing in order to better understand the dynamics between maternal colonization breastmilk siga cytokine production and subsequent infant colonization over time.we did not conduct any analysis of the association between cytokines and siga antibody and gbs colonization as the com- plexity of the model and the sample size needed was outside of the scope of this study.

the association between breastmilk immune factors and infant colonization and disease prevention has not been elucidated.objectives we have investigated the association between siga and cytokines in breastmilk and infant gbs colonization and clearance.methods motherinfant gbs colonization was determined in a prospective cohort of 750 gambian motherinfant pairs followed to day 89 of life.

several studies have shown that breastfed infants are better protected from infections of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts compared to formula-fed infants -.
