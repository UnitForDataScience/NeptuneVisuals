The underlying working mechanistic links between migraine and gastrointestinal diseases may include increased intestinal epithelial permeability and inflammation.Objective This review presents an overview of the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function especially with regard to migraine headache.Study Design Literature review.Setting Anesthesia and Operation Center Department of Anesthesiology Chinese PLA General Hospital.Methods The present investigation included a PubMed search using the following terms migraine headache gut microbiota brain function and probiotics.Results In this literature review we mainly discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function especially with regard to migraine headache.

Results from a randomized controlled trial conducted in healthy volunteers have suggested that probiotics could improve the gut epithelial bar- rier via modulation of the expression of tight junction proteins in the gut epithelial layer 23.As probiotics have been able to repair increased intestinal permeability and maintain the gut barrier function these microorganisms may relieve migraine headache through improved gut epithelial permeabil- ity in patients.

Thus a significant relationship has been found between migraine headache and various inflammatory diseases including gastrointestinal disorders obesity allergies and asthma.Evidence from a clinical trial among patients with migraine headache who also had irritable bowel syn- drome reported on the estimated influence of a dietary intervention lasting 6 weeks with significant improve- ment in migraine headache attack counts duration and maximum severity.

The present review aims to discuss the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function as well as the influence of probiotic supplements on the migraine headache patient and potential mechanisms underlying such influence.Gut Microbiota and Brain FunctionThe human gut contains over a thousand known bacterial species with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutesphy- la being the predominant strains 7.

The positive effects of normal gut microbiota on health in- clude maintenance of the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier and gut mobility regulation of polysaccharide degradation and improved nutrient absorption.

The major anatomical connections between the brain and gut system involve brain tissues the spinal cord vagal and spinal nerves gut tissues microbiota and their metabolites residing in the gut and the en- docrine and immune systems.

The potential effects of probiotics supplement on migraine headache were also included.Limitations There is limited evidence from clinical studies of the positive effects of probiotics in patients with migraine headache.

Patients with migraine headache usuallysuffer from moderate to severe episodes of headache lasting several hours to days.

Other studies have suggested that migraine headache is significantly associated with inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease 56 however the specific relationship between migraine headache and gastrointestinal microbiology primarily pertaining to intestinal bacteria remains unclear.

Patients with migraine headache more frequently suffer from gastrointestinal diseases than healthy controls and patients with gastrointestinal disease more often have migraines headache when compared to normal controls.
