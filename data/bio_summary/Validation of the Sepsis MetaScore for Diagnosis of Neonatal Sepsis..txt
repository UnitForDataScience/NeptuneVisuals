Receiver operating characteristic ROC curves for logistic models of the Sepsis MetaScore SMS alone replotted to account for patients with missing laboratory data plus clinical laboratory results in binary or raw form with or without the SMS for each cohort A Cernada et al  n  36 B Smith et al  n  68 no CRP data were available for this cohort and C Wynn et al  n  83 all 4 subgroups are combined because no substantial differences were found in subgroup analysis for individual laboratory results thus the same controls were counted twice in their respective comparison groups.

The SMS had a consistently high diagnostic accuracy in each cohort area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC 95 confidence interval CI 0.93 0.89-0.98 Cernada et al 0.92 0.89-0.94 Smith et al and 0.92 0.89-0.95 Wynn et al .

For the Smith et al  cohort after COCONUT conormalization and for the Wynn et al  cohort technical replicates were summarized as the mean gene expression level.Diagnostic CalculationsThe 11-gene SMS is calculated according to the formula below in which each gene represents its relative expression value in a given sample .

It should be noted that both the Wynn et al  and Cernada et al data were not available at the time of the publication of the SMS report which lends validity to the independence of these cohorts .

Cohorts Examining Genome-Wide Expression in Whole Blood From Neonates With SepsisAbbreviation VLBW very low birth weight.aSmith et al also included a group of neonates with what they considered possible sepsis not listed.Sepsis MetaScore in Neonatal Sepsis  JPIDS 2017XX XX XXXX  3had similar birth weights mean 930-2090 g range 500-3480 g and gestational ages mean 26-33 weeks range 23-41 weeks.Diagnostic Accuracy of the SMSWe first tested the SMS for diagnostic accuracy in distinguish- ing septic neonates from controls in each of the 3 cohorts according to the sepsis definitions defined in Methods.

In addition in the Smith et al cohort when the possibly septic neonates not included in the ROC curves were compared with those with confirmed bacteremia the SMS had excellent discriminatory accuracy AUC 0.90.

The SMS showed significant NRI values range 0.3-0.69 P  .05 for all cases except the Smith et al binary lab- oratory results comparison NRI 0.13 P  .11 Supplementary Tables 2-4.

It should be noted that the 11 genes in the SMS have only 1 overlap with the other previously described gene-expression scores BATF Mahajan et al .

Of course these estimates assume a single bright-line cutoff for the SMS a more real-world application of the SMS might be the eventual calibration of probabilities of sepsis.Comparison of the SMS to the Diagnostic Accuracy of Laboratory Tests For each cohort we tested the diagnostic accuracy of standard clinical laboratory test results WBC count ANC CRP level both in raw form and at standard cutoff values  .

CRP levels from the Smith et al   cohort were not available.Sepsis DefinitionsIn each cohort sepsis was defined the same as it was by the initial authors.
