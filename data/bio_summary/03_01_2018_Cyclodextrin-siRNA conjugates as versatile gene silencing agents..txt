1331.27 Da conjugated with the sense strand of Luciferase siRNA.12010080Cellular delivery of CD-siRNA conjugates using polycationic lipids Lipofectamine 2000 and heptakis2-O-N-3''-aminopropyl-1'H-triazole- 4'-yl-methyl-6-dodecylthio-b-cyclodextrin shows the reduction in luminescence intensity of PC3-Luc cells overexpressing luciferase protein on treatment with luciferase siRNA or its cyclodextrin conjugates CDmal-siRNA and CDSS-siRNA mediated by Lf2000 for 4 h. Suppression of luciferin protein in PC3-Luc cells by the conjugated siRNA was found to be comparable to that for the unconjugated siRNA P  0.05.

More importantly siRNA conjugation with cyclodextrin does not cause the silencing inhibition observed for example withconjugated PEG molecules of large molecular weight  .Cellular delivery of CD-siRNA conjugates using a targeted nanoparticle formulationBesides delivery by polycationic lipids which demonstrated the ability of the CD-siRNA conjugates to produce knockdown we in- corporated the conjugates into nanoparticulate formulations to de- monstrate the special assembly properties conferred on the RNA by such conjugation.

The cells were maintained in a humidified chamber at 37 degC with 5 CO2.Cellular delivery of CD-siRNA conjugates complexed with Lipofectamine 2000Cellular delivery of luciferase CD-siRNA conjugates was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 Sigma USA 50 nM of unconjugated or conjugated siRNA was delivered using Lf2000 with final vectorsiRNA ratio 1 mL Lf2000 20 pmol siRNA as recommended by the supplier.

The nanoparticles prepared as above were incubated with U87 cells 25000 cellswell in 24 well plate and DU145 cells 50000 cellswell in 24 well plate for 24 h and gene knockdown was analyzed at 48 h.For competitive inhibition assay in U87 cells 25000 cellswell in24 well plate inclusion complex with the adamantyl-PEG500-RVG targeted formulation was formed and complexed with chitosan polymer at MR 1 and 10.

The cells were either treated or untreated with the 30 mM of RVG peptide U87 cells for 30 mins and 100 mM of adamantly- PEG5000-AA2 for 1 h DU145 cells followed by treatment with their respective targeted formulations for 4 h. The PLK 1 gene knockdown analysis was performed at 24 h.Determination of gene knockdown using quantitative real-time PCRCells were lysed and RNA was extracted after 48 hour transfection using GenElutetm Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit Sigma as per manufacturer's instructions.

In addition the disulfide-linked conjugates de- monstrated a significantly higher level of knockdown compared to the sulfanyl-linked conjugates probably due to disulfide biolability.Following confirmation of the silencing activity of CD-siRNA con- jugates an example of performance of the cyclodextrin moiety in en- abling a new mode of formulating RNA was assessed.

Gene knockdown in PC3 cells with CD-siRNA PLK1 conjugates 50 nM delivered by cationic amphiphilic cyclodextrin at MR 20.

Retention of the gene knockdown activity of the RNAs di- rected at cancer cells that over-express either luciferase gene or PLK1 gene was assessed by delivery of the CD-RNA conjugates using two polycationic lipids Lipofectamine 2000 and a polycationic amphiphilic cyclodextrin.

Gene knockdown results for human glioblastoma cells U87 and prostate cancer cells PC3 DU145 showed that conjugation to the cyclodextrin did not reduce gene silencing by the RNA.
