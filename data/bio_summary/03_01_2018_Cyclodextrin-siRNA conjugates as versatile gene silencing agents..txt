the nanoparticles prepared as above were incubated with u87 cells 25000 cellswell in 24 well plate and du145 cells 50000 cellswell in 24 well plate for 24 h and gene knockdown was analyzed at 48 h.for competitive inhibition assay in u87 cells 25000 cellswell in24 well plate inclusion complex with the adamantyl-peg500-rvg targeted formulation was formed and complexed with chitosan polymer at mr 1 and 10. for du145 cells 50000 cellswell in 24 well plate inclusion complex with the adamantyl-peg5000-aa2 targeted formulation was formed and complexed with chitosan polymer at mr 1 and 10. the cells were either treated or untreated with the 30 mm of rvg peptide u87 cells for 30 mins and 100 mm of adamantly- peg5000-aa2 for 1 h du145 cells followed by treatment with their respective targeted formulations for 4 h. the plk 1 gene knockdown analysis was performed at 24 h.determination of gene knockdown using quantitative real-time pcrcells were lysed and rna was extracted after 48 hour transfection using genelutetm mammalian total rna miniprep kit sigma as per manufacturer's instructions.

more importantly sirna conjugation with cyclodextrin does not cause the silencing inhibition observed for example withconjugated peg molecules of large molecular weight  .cellular delivery of cd-sirna conjugates using a targeted nanoparticle formulationbesides delivery by polycationic lipids which demonstrated the ability of the cd-sirna conjugates to produce knockdown we in- corporated the conjugates into nanoparticulate formulations to de- monstrate the special assembly properties conferred on the rna by such conjugation.

the cells were maintained in a humidified chamber at 37 degc with 5 co2.cellular delivery of cd-sirna conjugates complexed with lipofectamine 2000cellular delivery of luciferase cd-sirna conjugates was performed using lipofectamine 2000 sigma usa 50 nm of unconjugated or conjugated sirna was delivered using lf2000 with final vectorsirna ratio 1 ml lf2000 20 pmol sirna as recommended by the supplier.

the percentage gene plk1 knockdown was determined at 48 h by performing rna extraction and qrt pcr.preparation of targeted cd-sirna formulations with adamantyl-peg- ligand and chitosan and cellular deliverycell-targeted inclusion complexes of cd-sirna conjugates were prepared using adamantyl-peg500-rvg and adamantyl-peg5000-dia- nisamide aa2 and untargeted complexes using adamantane-peg500 and adamantane-peg500 respectively at molar ratio 11. rvg ligand targeted acetylcholine receptors on u87 human brain cancer cells and aa2 targeted sigma 1 receptors on du145 human prostate cancer cells.

in addition the disulfide-linked conjugates de- monstrated a significantly higher level of knockdown compared to the sulfanyl-linked conjugates probably due to disulfide biolability.following confirmation of the silencing activity of cd-sirna con- jugates an example of performance of the cyclodextrin moiety in en- abling a new mode of formulating rna was assessed.

retention of the gene knockdown activity of the rnas di- rected at cancer cells that over-express either luciferase gene or plk1 gene was assessed by delivery of the cd-rna conjugates using two polycationic lipids lipofectamine 2000 and a polycationic amphiphilic cyclodextrin.

gene knockdown results for human glioblastoma cells u87 and prostate cancer cells pc3 du145 showed that conjugation to the cyclodextrin did not reduce gene silencing by the rna.

we have used amphiphilic cationiccyclodextrins for successful delivery of sirna to neuronal cells   to prostate cancer cells  and in a scaffold-based 3d prostate cancer bone metastasis model .

the ada- mantyl rvg- and dianisamide-targeted derivatives were directed at the acetyl choline receptors on human brain cancer cells u87 and sigma receptors on prostate cancer cells pc3 and du145 respectively.

a third mode of delivery involved formation of targeted nanoparticles in which the conjugate was first complexed with adamantyl-peg-ligands targeting ligand rvg peptide or dianisamide by adamantyl inclusion in the cyclodextrin cavities of the conjugates followed by charge neutralisation with the cationic polymer chitosan.
