the strain was cultivated in 50 ml of modified k medium 2 g of yeast 2 g of glucose 3 g of mannitol 5 g of soytone 5 g of starch and 1 g of calcium carbonate in 1 l of distilled h2o.

therefore the hexose moiety was determined to be n-acetyl glucosamine .to determine the absolute configuration of the glucosaminemoiety in deinococcucin a 1 the compound was subjected to acid hydrolysis yielding glucosamine which was derivatized using hexamethyldisilazane hmds and tms-cl and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy gc ms. the derivative of glucosamine from n-acetyl glucosamine in 1 exhibited a retention time that was consistent with that of the authentic d-glucosamine derivative.to determine the absolute configuration of deinococcucin a1 the phenylglycine methyl ester pgme method was applied.prior to this procedure acid hydrolysis of 1 mainly yielded a 23-dihydroxypropanoic acid 5. the carboxylic acid group at c-1 in 5 was then derivatized with s- or r-pgme to yield the s- or r-pgme amide 5a and 5b respectively.

colonies were repeatedly inoculated onto fresh yeme agar 1 l of distilled water 18 g of agar 4 g of yeast extract 4 g of glucose and 10 g of malt extract plates to obtain a pure culture.strain sjn1 was identified as a deinococcus sp.

the 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopic data of displayed almost identical features to those of 1. careful analysis of the nmr data disclosed the presence of one additional sp3 methylene carbon in the lipid chain of 2 compared to 1 thus determining the structure of 2 as an analogue of 1 with a c17 alkyl chain.deinococcucin c 3 was obtained as a colorless oil and its molecular formula was deduced to be c27h50n2o8 based on its hresims data.

however no significant effects of deinococcucins b 2 and d4 were observed .figure 4. degradation of 1 to 23-dihydroxypropanoic acid 5 and derivatization of 5 to s- and r-pgme amides.

careful comparison of the nmr spectroscopic data  revealed that the 1h and 13c nmr spectra of 3 in dmso-d6 were very similar to those of 1 but that deinococcucin c 3 bears two overlapped sp2 methine carbons dc 129.0 indicating that 3 possesses a double bond in the hydrocarbon chain.

the 13c nmr data revealed the presence of 27 carbon signals which were classified from the hsqc spectrum as two sp3 methyl dc 22.8 and 13.9 17 sp3 methylene dc 69.6-29.1 and six sp3 methine dc 97.1 72.6 70.8 70.8 70.4 and 53.4 carbons and two carbonylcarbons dc 171.1 and 169.3.the three partial structures a hexose ring 23-dihydrox- ypropanoic acid and an alkyl amine hydrocarbon chain were assembled based on the hmbc correlations.

therefore the planar structure of deinococcucin a 1 was elucidated as a new aminoglycolipid .deinococcucin b 2 was purified as a colorless oil with a molecular formula of c28h54n2o8 determined from its hresims data.
