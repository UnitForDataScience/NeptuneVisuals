hepatic expression of abcg5 abcg8 abca1 abcg1 and apoe remained unaffected by the sscd diet while abca1 expression in proximal small intestine was evendownregulated in sscd fed mice p  0.05. furthermore macrophage mrna expression of abca1 and abcg1 were not different between the groups data not shown and consistent with these data there was also no discernible difference in cholesterol efflux capacity between peritoneal macrophages isolated from control and sscd fed conventional mice 10.3 8.4-12.8 versus 13.5 11.8-14.4  respectively.sscd does not affect total bile acid excretion but changes bile acid compositiontotal bile acids in plasma remained unaffected fig.

changes in cholesterol metabolism translated into increased macrophage-to-feces rct in sscd-administered mice 1.5-fold p  0.05. in germ-free c57bl6j mice sscd similarly lowered plasma cholesterol -40 p  0.05. however sscd increased fecal neutral sterol excretion 7.5-fold p  0.01 bile acid excretion 2-fold p  0.05 and rct 2.5-fold p  0.01 even more substantially in germ-free mice compared with the effect in conventional mice.conclusion in summary this study demonstrates that sscd lowers plasma cholesterol levels and increases fecal cholesterol excretion from a rct-relevant pool.

in addition it can also not be excluded that sscd fermentation might decrease the amount of sscd available for cholesterol and bile acid binding.since in our hands dietary administered sscd acts mostlyin the intestinal compartment to increase fecal sterol excre- tion and rct we expect that sscd could reduce the incidence of cvd events also when given on top of statin therapy simi- lar to the drug ezetimibe 47. in addition sscd has no known toxic effects even up to a very high intake of 20 19 20 thus presenting in our view a viable dietary health supplement for primary or secondary prevention indications.

com- bined these data indicate that the metabolic effects of sscd on sterol homeostasis translate into a significant increase in rct which is even more pronounced in the absence of in- testinal bacteria.discussionthe results of this study demonstrate that i the non- digestible cyclic carbohydrate sscd increases fecal neutral sterol excretion from a rct-relevant pool in mice and ii sscd even more substantially enhances fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion in germ-free mice translating into an overall 2.5-fold increase in rct.

however otherbile acid synthesis-related genes such as cholesterol 7a.- hydroxylase cyp7a1 also an lxr target in mice and sterol 27-hydroxylase cyp27a remained unchanged table 1.sscd increases fecal neutral sterol excretion to a greater extent in germ-free mice lackingintestinal microbiotain order to determine the extent to which the intestinal microbiota mediates the cholesterol lowering effect of sscd a dietary intervention with sscd was performed in germ-free mice.

sscd fed mice exhibited unchanged hepatic mrna expression of hmgcoar hmgcs1 expression was lower but not significantly table 1 and plasma lathosterolcholesterol ratios were higher in sscd receiving mice compared to controls 0.0045 0.0042-0.0054 versus 0.0100 0.0095-0.0143 p  0.05 indicating that overall sscd might increase endogenous cholesterol synthesis to a certain extent.

cdca ca or dca are known ago- nists for fxr activation in the liver resulting in a suppres- sion of bile acid synthesis 40-42. on the other hand mca has been implied as an antagonist of fxr activation and is thus expected to increase hepatic bile acid synthesis 43. this could partially explain the considerable 2-fold increase in bile acid excretion and increased recovery of rct-relevant choles- terol in the fecal bile acid fraction 2-fold of germ-free mice.

in contrast it ap- pears that the effectiveness of sscd to increase rct is even higher in the absence of microbiota in germ-free mice.non-digestible oligosaccharides such as sscd can ex- ert metabolic health effects either directly through bindingfigure 3. effect of sscd containing diet on macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport in conventional mice.

on the other hand hepatic mrna expression of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism such as steroyl-coa desaturase scd1 fatty acid synthase fasn and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c srebp-1c were significantly lower in germ-freefigure 2. sscd induces shifts in bile acid profiles.

in the liver a reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels was observed p  0.05 table 2. liver mrna expression of hmgcoar was upregulated in sscd receiving germ-free mice compared to controls p  0.05 table 3 and also the plasma lathosterolcholesterol ratio was significantly increased 0.0025 0.0023-0.0026 versus 0.0208 0.0197-0.0230 respectively p  0.05 by sscd administration in germ-free mice.

this increase was mainly due to a significantly higher tracer re- covery in the fecal neutral sterol fraction p  0.01 whereas tracer recovery in the bile acid fraction was comparable in both groups.cholic acid umol24 h 0.41 0.37-0.44 0.35 0.34-0.37next the rct study was performed in germ-free mice.ursodeoxycholic acid umol24 hchenodeoxycholic acid umol24 hn.d.n.d.0.10 0.07-0.11 0.680.60-0.75here 3h-cholesterol tracer recovery was two-fold lower in plasma 48 h after macrophage injection p  0.01 fig.
