In terms of fecal bile acid excretion a.-muricholic and chenodeoxycholic acid were increased compared to the control group p  0.05 Table 2 whereas secondary BA such as w-muricholic and deoxycholic acid which were lowered in conventional mice upon ssCD feeding were not detected in both groups under germ-free conditions.Total cholesterol nmolmg of liverTriglycerides nmolmg of liverFecal neutral sterol profiles10.269.95-10.6121.6620.19-23.866.48 6.24-6.70 7.75 6.48-10.48ssCD increases macrophage-to-feces RCT andthis effect is more pronounced in germ-free miceFinally macrophage-to-feces RCT experiments were per-Cholesterol umol24 h 1.33 1.20-1.62 11.369.54-13.01formed in conventional mice to determine whether the ob-Dihydrocholesterol umol24 hCoprostanol umol24 hFecal bile acid profilesa.-Muricholic acid umol24 h13-Muricholic acid umol24 hw-Muricholic acid umol24 hDeoxycholic acid umol24 h0.12 0.11-0.13 0.12 0.09-0.14n.d.n.d.0.12 0.11-0.18 1.020.95-1.050.60 0.45-0.70 0.150.13-0.17n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.served alterations in sterol metabolism upon ssCD feedingwould also translate into changes in RCT a pathway with prime relevance for the protection against atherosclerotic CVD.

In addition it can also not be excluded that ssCD fermentation might decrease the amount of ssCD available for cholesterol and bile acid binding.Since in our hands dietary administered ssCD acts mostlyin the intestinal compartment to increase fecal sterol excre- tion and RCT we expect that ssCD could reduce the incidence of CVD events also when given on top of statin therapy simi- lar to the drug ezetimibe 47.

Com- bined these data indicate that the metabolic effects of ssCD on sterol homeostasis translate into a significant increase in RCT which is even more pronounced in the absence of in- testinal bacteria.DiscussionThe results of this study demonstrate that i the non- digestible cyclic carbohydrate ssCD increases fecal neutral sterol excretion from a RCT-relevant pool in mice and ii ssCD even more substantially enhances fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion in germ-free mice translating into an overall 2.5-fold increase in RCT.

On the other hand hepatic mRNA expression of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism such as steroyl-CoA desaturase Scd1 fatty acid synthase Fasn and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c Srebp-1c were significantly lower in germ-freeFigure 2. ssCD induces shifts in bile acid profiles.

This increase was mainly due to a significantly higher tracer re- covery in the fecal neutral sterol fraction p  0.01 whereas tracer recovery in the bile acid fraction was comparable in both groups.Cholic acid umol24 h 0.41 0.37-0.44 0.35 0.34-0.37Next the RCT study was performed in germ-free mice.Ursodeoxycholic acid umol24 hChenodeoxycholic acid umol24 hn.d.n.d.0.10 0.07-0.11 0.680.60-0.75Here 3H-cholesterol tracer recovery was two-fold lower in plasma 48 h after macrophage injection p  0.01 Fig.

However ssCD increased fecal neutral sterol excretion 7.5-fold p  0.01 bile acid excretion 2-fold p  0.05 and RCT 2.5-fold p  0.01 even more substantially in germ-free mice compared with the effect in conventional mice.Conclusion In summary this study demonstrates that ssCD lowers plasma cholesterol levels and increases fecal cholesterol excretion from a RCT-relevant pool.

However otherbile acid synthesis-related genes such as cholesterol 7a.- hydroxylase Cyp7A1 also an LXR target in mice and sterol 27-hydroxylase Cyp27A remained unchanged Table 1.ssCD increases fecal neutral sterol excretion to a greater extent in germ-free mice lackingintestinal microbiotaIn order to determine the extent to which the intestinal microbiota mediates the cholesterol lowering effect of ssCD a dietary intervention with ssCD was performed in germ-free mice.
