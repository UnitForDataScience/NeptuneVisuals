With rare exceptions phages had only one muf gene 614 muf genes were retrieved from 611 distinct phage genomes.Domain architecture of MuF domain-containing proteins Among all four families of MuF proteins we found two major domain architectures canonical proteins without a C-terminal extension henceforth called short and proteins with a C-terminal extension Fig.

There is a significant association of muf genes encoding toxin proteins with Firmicutes compared to muf genes encoding short proteins p  0.0001 two-tailed Fisher's exact test and there is a significant association of muf genes encoding proteins with aC-terminal extension without known domain with Proteobacteria compared to muf genes encoding short proteins p  0.0001 two-tailed Fisher's exact test.

The abundance of MuF proteins encoded by Siphoviri- dae genomes suggests a general functional or struc- tural role of MuF proteins locating in the viral head of Caudovirales in line with the experimental data on the Gp7 protein of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPP1 - Indeed in bacteriophage SPP1 Gp7 binds the portal protein and is present in one to two copies per capsid .We predicted the lifestyle virulent versus temperate of 979 Caudovirales phages see  Additional file Table S1 which allowed us to determine that virulent phages encoded very few MuF proteins and contained no single MuF protein with a known toxin domain Fig.

Our initial searches using hidden Markov model HMM profiles of MuF1 and MuF2 domains to retrieve proteins con- taining a MuF domain revealed that muf genes were located immediately downstream of genes encoding phage portal proteins Fig.

Since both species share the same niche in the human nasopharynx the possibility of DNA exchange between them may be advocated.Distribution of MuF proteins and toxinsMuF proteins and toxins are encoded by bacteriophages and bacterial genomesWe found that around 35 of the 1753 tailed phages and 25 of the 2464 bacterial genomes in our datasets harbored at least one muf gene Fig.

Among the 901 muf genes identified in these bacterial chromosomesmost 90 were located within prophages and 3 within putative prophage remnants elements smaller than 18 kb see Among the remaining nearly half were found to be located close to genes encoding proteins with similarity to portal or termi- nase proteins and could also correspond to prophageremnants see Altogether almost all 96 of the muf genes found in bacterial genomes were as- sociated with either complete prophages or prophage remnants Additional file  Table S6.

Hence these toxins could play an important role in gut microbiota especially since more than half of the bac- teria found in the gut belong to the Firmicutes phylum We thus searched for MuF proteins in human gut microbiomes using a non-redundant catalog of 10 mil- lion proteins .

Infecting phages are known to inject proteins along with their DNA in the bacterial cytoplasm as demonstrated for several ADP-ribosyl transferase proteins of virulent T4 phage In support of this hypothesis 14 of the 191 MuF toxins identified in our study are also putative ADP- ribosyl transferases Additional file Tables S4 S5.What could be the role of MuF toxins If these pro- teins or their toxin domains are delivered into the host cytoplasm their effects may resemble those of homologous toxin domains of T6SS and T5SS which lead to growth inhibition of the competitors.

We did not identify proteins belonging to additional MuF families among the proteins encoded by these genes.Identification of MuF proteinsWe used the HMM profiles of MuF1 MuF2 MuF3 and MuF4 domains to scan our datasets of bacteriophages and bacterial genomes using the hmmsearch program of HMMER v3.1b1 with the -cutga option.

The list of the MuF proteins retrieved from the in- tegrated reference catalog of the human gut microbiome is provided in Additional file Table S8.Architecture of MuF proteinsDomain architectures of MuF proteins were analyzed with the CDvist tool  against the Pfam 28.0 domain database and the Conserved Domain Database CDD v3.12  To determine the minimal length re- quired to define the presence of a C-terminal extension we searched for the shortest C-terminal extension con- taining a toxin domain in our dataset.
