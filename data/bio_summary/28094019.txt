found that mothers who fed their infants breast milk in the first 6 months of life or who breastfed them for longer periods had decreased odds of restricting their children's food intake at 1 year suggesting a virtuous circle between prolonged breastfeeding and self controlled eating behaviors.there are reports suggesting that infants are able to adjust the volume of milk consumed to maintain a constant energy intake  .

suggested that because breastfeeding mothers cannot directly monitor how much milk their infants consume compared to bottle-feeding mothers the quantity of milk consumed is primarily under the infants' control.

this is the most recent publication in the large body of literature examining the effects of breastfeeding on intellectual outcome.the less developed brain of preterm infants particularly those with very low birth weight vlbw theoretically could benefit from feeding maternal milk since it contains critical nutrients such as lcpufa and possibly other neurotrophic factors.there is no randomized clinical trial comparing the neurodevelop- ment outcome of human milk hm versus formula or minimal hm feeding that included only children with vlbw.

in addition breastfeeding has been associated with greater cognitive development in childhood .long-term breastfeeding particularly full breastfeeding is one of the most studied factors of neurodevelopment in recent years with several studies reporting beneficial effects on child neuropsychological development .breastfeeding was consistently associated with higher performance in intelligence tests in children and adolescents with a pooled increase of 3.4 intelligence quotient iq points 95 ci 23-46 based on the findings of 16 observational studies that controlled for several con- founding factors including home stimulation .

interestingly effects of lcpufas supplementation to infant formulas have not been conclusive whereas a maternal diet supplementation with very-long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cod liver oil during pregnancy and lactation was associated with a beneficial effect on the child's cognitive function after controlling for confounding factors .more light has been shed onto the complexity of the association between breastfeeding and intellectual outcome by the important study of who demonstrated that there is an interaction in the association between breastfeeding and intellectual outcome in associations with polymorphisms in the fads2 gene controlling for the delta-6 desaturation step in the biosynthesis of lc-pufa particu- larly docosahexaenoic acid.this new line of research points to the growing evidence that gene- environment interaction may play an important role in determining the variability of outcome .in summary breastfeeding may have an effect on intellectual abilities but this effect is modulated by genetic variations in fatty acid metabolism.

in addition a lack of breastfeeding was associated with low child's iq and this association weakened but remained significant even after adjusting for maternal iq and the diagnosis of adhd.protective effect of breastfeeding on behavioral problems might be partially mediated by the child's iq whereas positive effect of breastfeeding on intelligence might be partially mediated by attention problem of children.

accordingly breastfed infants have traditionally been reported to follow a peculiar growth fashion characterized by a rapid weight gain in the first weeks of life then followed by a fast decrease in growth rates a capacity to self regulate the sense of hungry and satiety and a minor propensity towards overweight and obesity later on in parallel with a better neurodevelopmental performance.abbreviations tee total energy expenditure ee energy expenditure smr sleeping metabolic rate aa amino acid nrem nonrapid eye movement rem rapid eye movement tef thermic effect of food iq intelligence quotient lc-pufa long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids wais wechsler adult intelligence scale bpp borge priens prove vlbw very low birth weight hm human milk omm own mother's milk adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder cns central nervous system hfd high fat diet scfas short-chain fatty acids ec enterochromaffin correspondence to pediatric intermediate care unit department of clinical sciences and community health fondazione irccs ca granda-ospedale maggiore policlinico viadella commenda 20122 milano italy.e-mail address c. agostoni.received 26 july 2016 received in revised form 23 november 2016 accepted 1 january 2017available online 05 january 20170165-0327 c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.considering the way by which breastfed infants may keep their energy balance may help in understanding the biologic plausibility of these observations.energy requirements in infancyinfant energy requirements are the sum of total energy expenditure tee and energy stored during growth.

differing energy intakes between feeding groups imply that energy absorption expenditure and or deposition between groups also differ.differences in the macronutrient composition of human milk and formula combined with quite heterogeneous levels of milk intake result in significant differences in protein lactose and fat intake and may also influence energy utilization by infants.tee of breast-fed infants was shown to be lower than that of formula-fed infants   however differences in tee between the groups diminished after the first year of life.

found that feeding preterm infants with human milk results in significantly lower energy expenditure ee as compared with feeding with formula too consistent with data in term infants.for infants during the first half year of life until six months of age energy requirements are considered to be equal to the energy supply from human milk .feeding mode and sleeping metabolic ratein infants sleeping metabolic rate smr is 60 of tee and the metabolic expenditure of the brain contributes to around 70 of smr .the feeding mode seems to affect the sleep organisation the synthesis of brain neurotransmitters involved in the induction and maintenance of sleep is influenced by normal postprandial fluctuations in the availability of amino acid aa .

infant formulas prepared using cow's milk often have a higher protein content than breast milk and protein contributes more to tef than lipids and carbohydrates .

children who had consumed mother's milk in the early weeks of life had a significantly higher iq at 7.5-8 years than did those who received no maternal milk.

children whose mothers chose to provide milk but failed to do so had the same iq as those whose mothers elected not to provide breast milk.

limited available data do not provide strong evidence that feeding preterm infants with multi-nutrient fortified breast milk compared with unfortified breast milk affects important outcomes except that it leads to slightly increased in-hospital growth rates.lcpufas are important substrates for brain development.

lcpufas are present in human milk but not in cow's milk or most infant formulas.

within this context breastfeeding andor human milk as either behaviour or food habit is today believed to represent the element optimallyconnecting in the best way the requirements for growth and develop- ment.
