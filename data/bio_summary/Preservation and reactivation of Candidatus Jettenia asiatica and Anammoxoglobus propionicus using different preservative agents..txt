Considering this the present study aimed to evaluate the preservation and reactivation of anammox consortia enriched from swine manure treat- ment lagoons by using different preservative agents at different temperatures KNO3 at 4 0C glycerol -20 0C -80 0C and skimmed cow milk -20 0C -80 0C -200 0C.

Considering this the present study was performed to evaluate reactivation using different preservative agents KNO3 glycerol and skimmed cow milk atdifferent temperatures 4 0C 20 0C 80 0C and 200 0C afterbiomass freezing.

Treatments 4e6 were performed with the addition of preservatives as described above prefreezing at -20 0C followed of lyophilization at 1 mm Hg temperature from 40 0C to 20 0C for 6 days elevating 10 0C per 24 h. Each tube was stored at the noted temperature.

Preservation with skimmed cow milk at -80 0C favored the selection of Candidatus Anammoxoglobus propionicus while preservation with glycerol at -80 0C was successful for Candidatus Jettenia asiatica.

However storage at 4 0C was not successful for single-cell cultures of the marine anammox species Candidatus Scalindua .showed the presence of Candidatus Jettenia asiatica and Candidatus Anammoxoglobus propionicus species in a consortium enriched from swine manure lagoons.

Candidatus Kuenenia Candidatus Bro- cadia Candidatus Anammoxoglobus and Candidatus Jettenia have been enriched from activated sludge.

Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis was reac- tivated after being stored at 4 0C with glycerol   and Candidatus Brocadia caroliniensis was reactivated afterfreezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent lyophilization in skim- med milk medium .

However the disadvantage is that the reactors require high control to achieve stable simul- taneous nitrification and anammox processes  .The biomass that was preserved using skimmed cow milk at 80 0C was composed of Candidatus Jettenia asiatica Thermo- nonas Diaphorobacter capable of performing simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions and a low number of Candidatus Anammoxoglobus propionicus imme-diately after thawing.

These bacteria were the first anammox bacteria described  in wastewater treatment systems.Anammox bacteria community structureIn the biomass that was preserved with glycerol preservation at 80 0C we observed Candidatus Jettenia asiatica predominance with less than 10 Candidatus Anammoxoglobus propionicus .

The bacterial community from the biomass with anammox activity was characterized and showed the presence of Candidatus Brocadia anammox- idans Candidatus Jettenia asiatica and Candidatus Anammoxoglobus propionicus.
