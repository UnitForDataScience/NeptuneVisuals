Most of the soil nutrients including nitrogen N phosphorus P and potassium K did not show a significant difference in bulk soil between the newly planted tea field and the 30-year continuously monocultured tea field but soil pH was significantly lower in the 30-year-old tea plantation compared to the bulk soil in the two-year tea plantation Table S1.

As the richness and b-diversity of microbiota clearly indicate differences across different-aged tea plantations we hypothesized that these variations are chiefly governed-over time by the imbalance of soil physiochemical andor root exudates in tea fields.Our results showed no significant difference in the soil nutrients N P and K.Only soil pH significantly decreased in the 30-year-old tea plantation when compared with the bulk soil and the two-year-old tea field which resulted in lowering the abundance of rhizospheric microbiota such as Actinobacteria Cyanobacteria Chloroflexi and WD272  and showed direct association with Nitrospirae Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria.

Although most of the bacterial phylum depicted a strong negative correlation with the soil pH the Acidobacteria Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae had a strong positive association with soil pH clustering along axis-2 in both the bulk soil and the 30-year-old tea plantation Figure .

Previous studies on bacterial communities have clearly shown that nutrient deficiency did not significantly impact the soil microbiota however soil pH was proven to be the most influential factor in shaping the soil microbiota -.

The actual cause of a reduction in pH in older tea plantations was not studied until now so we hypothesized that soil pH in the 30-year-old soil decreases with the increasing level of root exudates allelochemicals.Our results depicted higher levels of PCA TF EC and EGC in ratooning 30-year-old tea monocropping fields which may cause the lowering of soil pH over time .

However future research is needed to further explore the underlying mechanisms of rhizoshperic microbial interactions mediated by root exudates and to identify the contributing factors to soil sickness in continuous tea monocropping.Materials and MethodsThe Collection of Plant and Rhizosphere Soil SamplesPlant leaves roots and soil samples of tea were collected from freshly planted 2 years old and old 30 years old tea fields and bulk soil was obtained from nearby uncultivated fields located in the observation station in Anxi county 11736I-11817I E 2450I-2526I N on the south coast of Fujian province China.

In rhizosphere soil there exists a positive soil feedback mechanism in which microorganisms mediate plant efficiency by producing plant growth hormones promoting plant nutrient uptake competitively suppressing plant pathogens and fixing nitrogen .

Production of autotoxins soil nutrient imbalance and the alteration of soil-associated microbial community composition are considered as fundamental issues related to autotoxicity and soil sickness .Autotoxicity-related problems are observed when practicing consecutive monoculture of agronomic crops forages fruits medicinal and horticultural plants -.

Meanwhile soil moisture in the 30-year-old tea field was higher in the bulk soil than in the two-year-old tea plantation Table S1.

Our findings suggest that removal of plant debris and pruned tea leaves from the soil can prevent the accumulation of PCA TF and EC which may delay the reduction in soil pH.
