The presence of predatory bacteria like Bdellovibrio has been reported earlier in granular sludge Wan et al.

AMB Expr 2017 7168DOI 10.1186s13568-017-0471-5Comparison of the bacterial community composition in the granular and the suspended phase of sequencing batch reactorsEniko Szabo1 Raquel Liebana1 Malte Hermansson2 Oskar Modin1 Frank Persson1 and Britt-Marie Wilen1IntroductionWastewater treatment by aerobic granular sludge is a low-footprint technology that allows effective pollutant removal even at high loading rates Beun et al.

.In this study we followed the community composition in granular sludge reactors at different operational con- ditions for 12 weeks both in the granular phase and the suspended phase effluent.

We assessed how the spatial distribution of certain taxa affected its wash-out and compared the bacterial com- munity in the granular and suspended phases to gain bet- ter understanding of the successional patterns in granular sludge reactors.Materials and methodsReactor setup and mediumThe experiments were carried out in three column-was concomitantly increased to permit an even 4 h cycle length.

The density of the bro- ken granule particle depends on the types of bacteria it is comprised of Gonzalez-Gil and Holliger  and on the predominant granulation mechanisms--self-aggrega- tion of floccular biomass self-aggregation of small gran- ules microcolony aggregation microcolony outgrowth or attachment of floccular biomass to granular biomass Barr et al.

The reactors were seeded from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant Gryaab Gothenburg with aerobicanoxic activated sludge.

The reactors were fed with a 50-50 mixture of synthetic and real wastewa- ter 6-times diluted reject water from the dewatering of digested sludge.

The average removal efficiency of organic material ammonium and total nitrogen during the last 4 weeks are shown in Table .DNA extraction PCR sequencing and data analysis Biomass for DNA extraction was collected three times per week both from the withdrawn reactor samples granular phase and from the effluent suspended phase at the end of the aerated phase.

The community composition of the granular and of the suspended phase followed the same dynamics throughout the experiment in all three experimental set-ups.
