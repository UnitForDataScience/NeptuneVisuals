Anxiety-like behavior in mouse recipients of fecal microbiota from IBS-D patients or healthy controls.A Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by the step-down test in mice colonized with fecal microbiota from healthy controls Healthy n  53 IBS-D patients with no anxiety IBS n  48 and IBS-D patients with anxiety IBS  A n  40.

We elected to focus on the microbiota from patients with IBS-D not only because of re- ported changes in the microbiota but also because this subgroup of patients exhibits increased intestinal permeability 30 that may pre- dispose them to immune activation a putative mechanism of gut dysfunction in at least a subset of IBS patients 31 32.RESULTSSelection of IBS-D patient donors with and without anxiety for fecal microbiota transplantation to germ-freerecipient miceStool samples were obtained from five healthy control individuals two males and three females mean age 42 years and eight patients with IBS-D three males and five females mean age 40 years.

This increase may contribute to water movement across the intestinal epithelium and the faster gastrointestinal transit ob- served in mice with IBS-D patient fecal microbiota.Fecal microbiota from IBS-D patients with moderate anxiety induces anxiety-like behavior in recipient micePsychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression affect 50 to 90 of patients with all subtypes of IBS 35 including IBS-D 20.

P  0.05 versus Healthy pooled data Mann-Whitney U test.Serum metabolomic profiles are different in mice colonized with IBS-D patient fecal microbiota compared to a healthycontrol microbiotaSera from 22 mice colonized with fecal microbiota from three healthy donors H1 to H3 and 30 mice colonized with fecal microbiota from five IBS-D patient donors P1 to P5 were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using two orthogonal columns in tandem.

Finally we identified several metabolites differentially produced among mice colonized with IBS-D patient microbiota ver- sus control fecal microbiota such as palmitic acid that has been shown to affect the central control of insulin and leptin signaling in rats 69 and glycerophosphocholine which is a parasympatho- mimetic acetylcholine precursor with potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia 70 71.Overall our data suggest that fecal microbiota from IBS-D patients may induce gut and brain dysfunction in recipient mice through multiple mechanisms including immune and metabolic pathways.

S1B.The fecal microbiota of IBS-D patients accelerates gastrointestinal transit in recipient miceDiarrhea was the dominant gastrointestinal symptom in the IBS-D patients included in this study.

B Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by the light preference test in mice colonized with fecal micro- biota from healthy controls n  53 IBS-D patients with no anxiety n  48 and IBS-D patients with anxiety n  40.

A CD3 T lymphocyte numbers were assessed by immunohistochemistry in the colon of mice colonized with fecal microbiota from healthy controls IBS-D patients with no anxiety and IBS-D patients with anxiety.

B b-Defensin 3 was assessed by qPCR in the colon of mice colonized with fecal microbiota from healthy controls IBS-D patients with no anxiety and IBS-D patients with anxiety.

Post hoc analysis P values are shown on individual graphs.depression scores as well as overall gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with IBS 46.The pathophysiology of IBS-D includes rapid intestinal transit and increased luminal fluid secretion 47 and these changes were induced in recipient mice after transplantation of fecal microbiota from IBS-D patients but not from healthy controls.
