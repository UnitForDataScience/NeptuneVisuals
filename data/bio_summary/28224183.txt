.Repeatedchronic social stress paradigmsThe difficulty for some laboratories to gain ethical approval for CMSCUMS models has in part lead to a shift towards chronic social stress paradigms which has also been driven by the accumulating evidence showing psychosocial stress to be a risk factor for MDD.

Therefore there has been a recent emphasis on using chronic stress models to gain a better understanding of the biological alterations that occur upon stress exposure as it is believed that this will better reflect the human situation Langgartner et al.

The severity of the stressors used in this study cannot be used today but a number of groups established what are termed either chronic mild stress CMS or chronic unpredict- able mild stress CUMS models based on these original find- ings.

These findings of stress inoculation and resilience resonate with Han Selye's statement that BIt is not stress that kills us but our reaction to it and also opens a newer ap- proach to the study of MDD namely resilience mechanisms in addition to mechanisms that convey vulnerability.Age and sexAs is evident from the review thus far rodent models of de- pression are typically performed in adult male mice and rats at the time of testingassessment.

However in the last few decades a focus on the development of novel stress-based paradigms and a focus on using hedonic anhedonic behaviour have led to renewed optimism in the use of animal models to assess aspects of MDD.Objectives Therefore in this review article dedicated to Athina Markou we summarise the use of stress-based animal models for studying MDD in rodents and how reward-related readouts can be used to validateassess the model andor treatment.Results We reveal the use and limitations of chronic stress paradigms which we split into non-social i.e.

Such models assessing negative bias or valence show great translational promise and can complement the models and readouts discussed in this review for review see Robinsonand Roiser .Important considerations when designingusing animal modelsIn addition to the factors we have described above there are a number of important considerations that researchers mustconsider when using animal models of MDD that may influ- ence their findings.

These alterations induced by stress hormones such as glucocorticoids and adrenaline include changes in volume dendritic architecture hippocampal neurogenesis as well as anhedonic-like behaviour.Importantly many of these changes occur within the brain reward circuitry revealing a great deal of intersection between the stress and reward pathways.

Additionally increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF signalling within the nucleus accumbens has been shown to reflect susceptibility to chronic stress whereas in- creased delta fosB signalling within this region conveys resil- ience to chronic stress exposure Berton et al.

.Chronic stress paradigmsGiven that chronic stress has repeatedly been linked with a wide variety of disorders including MDD numerous para- digms employing a wide range of different stressors both social and non-social have been employed.

However in the last decade or so the predominant model used to assess social stress is the chronic social defeat stress model Berton et al.
