Considering only the R and S soil fractions associated to the three plant species M. sativa MS C. nigrescens CN and D. glomerata DG the bacterial population assemblage was significantly driven by both plant species and soil fraction  PERMANOVA F112  4.72 p  0.001 and PERMANOVAF212  3.21 p  0.05 respectively Supplementary Table 2Bbut not by their interaction PERMANOVA F217 1.67 p  0.05 Supplementary Table 2B.

Here we compare the bacterial communities inhabiting the rhizosphere and root surrounding soils of three spontaneous plant species with a non-vegetated bulk soil from a site heavily contaminated with chlorinated persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals demonstrating that both the soil fraction and the plant species cooperated in the selection of a specific bacterial assemblage in the root-associated soils.

Since in vitro screening alone is not always sufficient to evaluate the actual PGP potential of bacterial strains   this result is encouraging for further in vivo tests with plant species selected for rhizoremediation trials considering that these bacteria are also well adapted to the heavy pollution of the SIN Caffaro soil.CONCLUSIONIn this work we reported that three spontaneous plant species selected in the strongly PCB-polluted soil of a historical contaminated site differentially affected the composition of the bacterial community in the root-associated soil fractions.

However the spread of bphA gene in the bacterial microbiota of the SIN Caffaro soil indicated an intrinsic PCB attenuation potential in this site regardless of soil fraction or plant species suggesting a stronger role of edaphic conditions rather than vegetation.Isolates Potential for RhizoremediationThe root system of plant growing on other PCB polluted sites was shown to host PCB metabolizing bacteria    .

The results showed that the recruitment of specific bacterial communities in the root-associated soil fractions was driven by both soil fractions and plant species explaining 21 and 18 of the total bacterial microbiome variation respectively.

The root system of three spontaneous plant species was collected from triplicate specimens for each plant species.

The majority of the strains 71 on average from each plant species proved to grow in presence of salt in the growth medium while a percentage comprisedbetween 58 and 71 tolerated high 42C and low 4Ctemperatures for growth and Supplementary Table 8.A total of 11 strains has been selected basing on PGP activities and abiotic stress tolerance traits Supplementary Figure 3 and have been tested in vivo on tomato as a model plant.

The strains were affiliated to different species belonging to the generaPseudomonas Acinetobacter Arthrobacter and Curtobacterium and presented an array of different in vitro PGP traits abiotic stress tolerance and bioremediation potential Supplementary Table 10.Despite showing only 1 and 2 in vitro PGP traits respectively strains 2-30 and 2-50 both isolated from CN plant and affiliated to different species of the genus Arthrobacter Supplementary Table 10 significantly promoted plant growth compared to the non-inoculated control .

ACC deaminase activity is known to lower ACC level in plant cells interfering with ethylene biosynthesis and thereby decreasing plant stress response potentially derivingfrom chemical phytotoxicity  .
