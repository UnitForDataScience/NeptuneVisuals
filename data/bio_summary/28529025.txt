Similar to the NDFB most of the donor banks are non-profit and primarily use FMT for treatment of patients with recurrent CDI.Legislation of a donor faeces bankThere is still considerable confusion about the regulatory as- pects of FMT e. The FDA dictates that adequate informed consent must be obtained before use of FMT products .

In The Netherlands FMT is currently regarded as an unclassified treatment approachwhich is allowed if applied safely for patients with recurrent CDITable 2Donor screening by laboratory screening of faeces and serum Laboratory screening serumLaboratory screening faecesor in the context of an approved investigational study protocol.Although FMT appears to be a typical transplantation product to most experts in the field  it does not fulfil the criteria for guidance by the EU tissue and cell transplantation act because the cellular component of FMT appears not to be the active substance.

The faeces is homogenized with saline using a mortar and pestle whereas some laboratories use a commercial blender .

The NDFB collects re- cipients' faeces and clinical data on the day of FMT and approxi- mately 3 weeks after the procedure.

The donor faeces sus-pension may be kept at room temperature for up to 3 hours or refrigerated at 40C for up to 6 hours.

The thawed faeces solution of approximately 200 mL is slowly infused through the duodenal tube with a 50 cc syringe at a rate of 10 cc min after which the tube is flushed with 50 mL tap water.

In the first 9 months after its opening 31 faeces suspensions to 18 different hospitals throughout The Netherlands have been distributed for treatment with FMT.
