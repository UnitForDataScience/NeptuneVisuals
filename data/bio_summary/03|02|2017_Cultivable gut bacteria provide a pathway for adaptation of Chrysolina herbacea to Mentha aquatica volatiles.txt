these results were indicative of a po- tential ability of the gut bacteria to modify the terpene profile of m. aquatica essential oil thereby modulating the plant-insect interaction.discussionthe interaction between bacteria and insects is becoming a major topic of discussion particularly when bacteria contribute to insect fitness through their involvement in food digestion.

.gc-ms analysis highlighted the ability of gut bacteria to modify the terpene composition of the m. aquatica essential oil as compared to controls without bacteria fig.

the carvone-rich m. spicata l. the menthol and menthone containing m. x piperita l. and a chemotype of m. longifolia l. particularly rich in piperitenone oxide were used to demonstrate the ability of c. herbacea to metabolize the plant terpenoids and the insect's amazing ability to catabolize biotransform them thereby producing new compounds.

this hypothesis could extend the possible role of the microorganisms living in the insect in- testinal tract which could be involved in biosynthesis of semiochemicals.in this study we have tested this hypothesis by charac- terizing the cultivable bacterial communities inhabiting the intestinal tract of c. herbacea female and male indi- viduals feeding on m. aquatica and then investigating the possibility that the microbial communities from the two sexes could be associated to specific metabolic pat- terns with respect to the ability to biotransform m. aqua- tica essential oil and release potential semiochemicals.resultschemical fingerprint of m. aquatica leaf and c. herbaceafrass volatilesthe discrimination of chemical patterns produced dur- ing the interaction between organisms represents one ofthe major challenges posed by multitrophic interactions -.

no strain was able to grow when dmso replaced glucose without essential oil.growth of gut bacteria in the presence of m. aquaticaessential oilwe also tested the capability of the bacterial isolates to grow both individually and in community by using the m. aquatica essential oil as sole carbon and energy source and biotransform it.

m. aquatica essential oil was incubated with gut bacteria co-cultures from c. herbacea male and female individuals and male blue- and female red-specific terpene profiles were determined by sbse and gc-ms. values are expressed as percentage increasedecrease with respect to the control without bacteria.

the diameters of the zones of growth inhibition were measured after subtracting the 1 cm-diameter of the agar disk containing the assayed bacterium and the mean - sd was calculated based on three independent experiments.growth of gut bacteria on chemically defined mediawe evaluated the ability of gut bacteria to grow in the chemically defined srm srm-0 without glucose or srm-oil media by replacing glucose with dmso- dissolved m. aquatica essential oil 0.0020.25 vv.

bacteria from males or females were co-cultivated in the presence of m. aquatica essential oil as detailed in the methods section and then essential oil components were extracted from the exhausted growth medium by stir bar sorptive extraction sbse technique and subjected to quantitative analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry gc- ms fig.

thus c. herbacea is attracted by pulegone produced by undamaged m. aquatica but is deterred by the metho- furan production by herbivore-infested m. aquatica.

pulegone is a terpene produced by intact m. aquatica plants to attract individ- uals of c. herbacea in contrast menthofuran is pro- duced by infested plants and has a potent repellent activity on c. herbacea conclusionsthis study focuses on the multitrophic association among m. aquatica its specific herbivore c. herbacea and the insect gut microbial community.

the beetles were starved for 24 h prior the experiments.essential oil distillationone kg of fresh leaves collected from m. aquatica cut- tings were hydrodistilled with a modified clevenger ap- paratus  and the essential oil was collected dried over anhydrous ammonium sulphate and stored at 5 degc for further studies.collection of plant volatiles from m. aquatica leaves andc.
