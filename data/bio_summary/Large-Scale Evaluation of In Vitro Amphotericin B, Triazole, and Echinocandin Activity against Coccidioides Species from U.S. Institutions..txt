These earlier in vitro findings are also in contrast to more recent findings of echinocandin in vivo activity in murine and human studies of coccidioidomycosis .Our study which evaluated a large number of clinical Coccidioides isolates found a wide range of echinocandin MICs and combined with more recent clinical reports suggests that this class may exhibit efficacy in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis.

Elevated MICs for the mold-active triazoles and amphotericin B were uncommon itraconazole 2 ugml 5486 1.0 posaconazole 1 ugml 4377 1.1 voriconazole 2 ugml 124991.2 and amphotericin B 2 ugml 11397 2.8.These results illustrate the relative frequency of elevated fluconazole MICs encoun- tered in clinical Coccidioides isolates and the in vitro superiority of newer mold-active triazoles.

We commonly found elevated fluconazole MICs with very high MICs 64 ugml in a number of isolates.

Despite the lack of large-scale susceptibility studies clinical experience suggests that higher fluconazole doses are often needed for a clinical response to be observed and doses of 800 mg for primary infection are now routinely recommended by some experts .Together our results and those of the earlier studies suggest that the in vitro MICs of Coccidioides are similar to those of Histoplasma and Blastomyces mycoses for which fluconazole is not the suggested first-line option  .

Future work focusing on outcomes in patients with infection from isolates with elevated MICs and the molecular mechanisms responsible for in vitro resistance should also be performed.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was performed using existing departmental funds.G.R.T.

Additional correlation with patient outcomes to determine the relevance of elevated MICs in Coccidioides isolates is needed.KEYWORDS Coccidioides coccidioidomycosis fluconazole itraconazole posaconazole voriconazole amphotericin B flucytosine caspofungin antifungal susceptibility testing endemic mycosesoccidioidomycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii.

Additionally we report for the first time to our knowledge the distri- bution of triazole MICs likely to be encountered during the care of patients with coccidioidomycosis.

This is in contrast to prior in vitro reports suggesting that echinocandins have limited in vitro activity against Coccidioides spp.
