a flavobacterium-affiliated phylotype bacte- roidetes displayed the second-highest relative abundance in the unsupplemented control and its relative abundance remained fairly stable during the anoxic incubation .

anoxic incubation of gut contents with or without supplemental saccharides yielded large alterations of the relative abundances of specific 16s rrna sequences with sequences of an aeromonas-related phylotype displaying a high relative abundance in all treatments and .

based on the relative abundances of 16s rrna sequences detected in the different treatments phylotypes affiliated with this family were less competitive than aeromonadaceae- and enterobacteriaceae-affiliated phylotypes relative to their comparative responses to supplemental saccharides.dominant phylotypes.

an aeromonas-related phylotype displayed a high relative abundance in all treatments whereas key enterobacteriaceae-affiliated phylotypes were stimulated by some but not all sac- charides.

bacteroidetes-related phylotypes displayed lower relative abundances in the first glucose experiment  a difference likely due to differences in the soil used to feed worms and also differences in worm batches.

ingestion of soil introduces this complex microbiome into the alimentary canal of the earthworm and phylotypes affiliated with aeromonadaceae and enterobacteriaceae were detected in gut contents and based on the relative abundance of detected 16s rrna sequences became highly active under anoxic conditions with supplemental saccharides .
