long-term dietary habits have a considerable effect on the human gut microbiota and epidemiological data have already indicated connections between diet constituents or dietary patterns and gut microbiota profile and functionality.the mediterranean diet is a healthy dietary pattern inspired by the food patterns of populations living around the mediterranean sea in the early 1960s.
