In addition studies of whole-grain fibers consistently demonstrate the improvements in stool frequency and consis- tency both in healthy 5 6 and constipated individuals 7 8 these studies used whole-grain rye WGR as an interventionAddress correspondence to SV e-mail .dk.Abbreviations used AR alkylresorcinol GI gastrointestinal OTU operational taxonomic unit ppm parts per million rRNA ribosomal RNA RS resistant starch RW refined wheat WGR whole-grain rye WGW whole-grain wheat.Manuscript received March 13 2017.

The WGW and WGR groups did not differ from each other in any of the variables tested.Conclusion Regular consumption of WGR and WGW affected fecal butyrate concentration and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy overweight adults supporting the hypothesis that WGR and WGW can be included in the diet equally to maintain gut health.

The Journal of NutritionNutrition and DiseaseWhole-Grain Rye and Wheat Affect Some Markers of Gut Health without Altering the Fecal Microbiota in Healthy Overweight Adults A 6-Week Randomized TrialStine Vuholm1 Dennis S Nielsen2 Kia Nohr Iversen1 Julie Suhr1 Peter Westermann3 Lukasz Krych2 Jens Rikardt Andersen1 and Mette Kristensen1Departments of 1Nutrition Exercise and Sports and 2Food Science Faculty of Science University of Copenhagen Copenhagen Denmark and 3Department of Chemistry and Bioscience Aalborg University Aalborg DenmarkAbstractBackground Whole grains have shown potential for improving gut health but evidence comparing different whole-grain types is lacking.Objective We investigated whether whole-grain wheat WGW and whole-grain rye WGR improve gut health in different ways compared to refined wheat RW with the primary outcomes of microbiota composition and gastrointestinal GI symptoms.

The fasting concentrations of ARs in week 6 also were higher in the WGW 120.8 nmolL IQR 100.1 nmolL and WGR groups 135.7 nmolL IQR 99.5 nmolL compared to the RW group 30.3 nmolL IQR 29.7 nmolL P  0.001 with no differences between the WGW and WGR groups.

For this OTU there was an effect of diet in women P  0.0001 q  0.003 with an increased relative abundance after consuming WGR compared to RW P  0.0001 q  0.001 whereas the WGW group did not differ from either the WGR or RW group Figure 2.

The major strength of this study is the similarity in study products in particular similar grain particle size and food structure between WGR and WGW study products which enabled us to address the potential differences between whole-grain types.In conclusion the consumption of WGW and WGR exerted beneficial effects on butyrate production stool regularity and1 Models were adjusted for age sex and baseline week 0.

Diet groups differed only in fecal butyrate concentration because the relative change in the RW group differed from both WGW and WGR groups whereas the WGW and WGR groups did not differ from each other.
