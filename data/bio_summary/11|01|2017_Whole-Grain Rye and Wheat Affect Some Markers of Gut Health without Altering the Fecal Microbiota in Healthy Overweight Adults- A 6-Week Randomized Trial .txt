the major strength of this study is the similarity in study products in particular similar grain particle size and food structure between wgr and wgw study products which enabled us to address the potential differences between whole-grain types.in conclusion the consumption of wgw and wgr exerted beneficial effects on butyrate production stool regularity and1 models were adjusted for age sex and baseline week 0. values with a different superscript letter within the same row are significantly different p  0.05. gi gastrointestinal rw refined wheat wgr whole-grain rye wgw whole-grain wheat.2 p values derive from logistic regression analyses comparing diet differences innumber of subjects with symptoms according to weeks.are produced from the fermentation of carbohydrates the dietary fibers of which are an important substrate however resistant starch rs is recognized as being the major source 36 and the concentrations of butyrate have been shown to increase from the fermentation of rs 38 39. the whole-grain products provided in our study contained markedly greater amounts of dietary fibers than the rw products 18 and they are likely to contain also more rs especially type 1 rs 40 however it was not measured.

rw refined wheat wgr whole- grain rye wgw whole-grain wheat.other studies found mainly bacterial differences within diet groups but they were not able to detect differences when compared to a control group 6 11 14. our results confirm the findings in the only other study using 16s rrna gene-targeted high-throughput amplicon sequencing which likewise reportedno differences in overall gut microbiota composition after a wgw intervention 13. increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that the adult colonic microbiota is rather unaffected by whole-grain consumption also when consumed as the more fiber-rich rye variety and in high doses as in the present study.

in agreement with our findings previous studies observed increased butyrate concentrations after a wgr intervention compared to a refined wheat bread intervention 5 7 17 however other studies reported no effect 6 12 34. increases in fecal scfas are considered to be beneficial and increases in butyrate are highlighted for having protective effects as a result of the regulatory influence of butyrate on colonocyte growth and differentiation this has been linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancers and inflammatory bowel disease 35 36. few studies to our knowledge have directly compared the effects from wgw and wgr but they have indicated that wgr has the most pronounced effects on butyrate concentra- tions when compared to wgw with similar dietary fiber contents both when studied in pigs 37 and in humans 17. this is not supported by the present study.

there were no differences between any of the diet groups in the relative change from baseline to week 6 in ph data not shown in total scfas in acetate and in propionate concentrations figure 3. diet groups differed only in fecal butyrate concentration because the relative change in the rw group differed from both wgw and wgr groups whereas the wgw and wgr groups did not differ from each other.
