The fasting concentrations of ARs in week 6 also were higher in the WGW 120.8 nmolL IQR 100.1 nmolL and WGR groups 135.7 nmolL IQR 99.5 nmolL compared to the RW group 30.3 nmolL IQR 29.7 nmolL P  0.001 with no differences between the WGW and WGR groups.

The WGW and WGR groups did not differ from each other in any of the variables tested.Conclusion Regular consumption of WGR and WGW affected fecal butyrate concentration and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy overweight adults supporting the hypothesis that WGR and WGW can be included in the diet equally to maintain gut health.

When noncompliant subjects were excluded from the analysis however fatigue was less frequent during the entire study period weeks 2 4 and 6 with an overall OR of 0.24 95 CI 0.10 0.53 in the WGW group and an OR of 0.29 95 CI 0.13 0.63 in the WGR group compared to the RW group.

For this OTU there was an effect of diet in women P  0.0001 q  0.003 with an increased relative abundance after consuming WGR compared to RW P  0.0001 q  0.001 whereas the WGW group did not differ from either the WGR or RW group Figure 2.
