Bacterial source tracking analyses were also used to examine the similarity of the maternal oral and gut microbiota as well as the placental microbiota to the infant's oral microbiota.

The cohort was divided into two groups based on similarity of the infant oral microbiota to the maternal oral microbiota the high-similarity group which had a similarity above the median similarity of 92.8 median 98.8 IQR 95.6-00 n 19 and the low similarity group which had a similarity below the median of 92.8 median 22.0 IQR 5.7-55.4 n 17 and Supplementary Table 1.Although taxa assigned to the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were the most prevalent members of the neonatal oral microbiota Supplementary Figure 3 in both similarity groups they could be clearly differenti- ated from each other.

Two distinct neonatal oral microbiota profiles were observed one strongly resembling the maternal oral microbiota and one with less similarity.

Disruption of microbiota transmission from mother to infant has been associated with obe- sity type I diabetesasthmaand neurodevelopmentlater in life.Identifying pioneer colonizers is essential to elucidate the early stages of microbiota development.

When comparing the bacterial community distances between the niches there was less distance between the bacterial communities of the maternal and neonatal oral microbiota compared to the placental and gut microbiota p  0.0001 1b.

These analyses showed that the neonatal oral microbiota profile is comprised principally of maternal oral microbiota 65.35 and OTUs of unknown environmental origin 31.56.

Despite the obvious influence of the mother's oral microbiota on most of the neonate profiles we still observed diversity across the cohort with respect to the degree of overlap between a mother's and infant's oral microbiota profiles.

Infants oral microbiota was subdivided into 2 groups based on high similarity in taxonomy group 1 n 19 or less similarity group 2 n 17 to their corresponding maternal oral microbiota.

The source of the initial neonatal microbiome and the factors dictating initial human oral microbiota development are unknown.
