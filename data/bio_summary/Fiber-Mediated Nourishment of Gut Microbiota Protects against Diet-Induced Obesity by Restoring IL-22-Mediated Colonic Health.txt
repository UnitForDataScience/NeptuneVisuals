together these results indicate that inulin's promo- tion of colon mass and improvement of metabolic syndrome are not largely mediated by scfa production.inulin restoration of colonic and metabolic health is dependent on il-22 we next began to consider other potential mechanisms whereby inulin might impact the microbiota to promote epithelial cell pro- liferation and production of antimicrobial gene expression that together might reduce hfd-induced microbiota encroachment and associated parameters of metabolic syndrome.

in contrast enrichment of hfd with cellulose has a relatively mild impact on microbiota composition.while mechanisms by which alterations in microbiota alter metabolic phenotype of the host are not well understood we have shown that both mice and humans with dysglycemia exhibit microbiota that infiltrate the mucus layer to attain a close prox- imity to host cells .

we observed that analogous to our results with gf mice antibiotic treatment greatly reduced the ability of inulin to promote microbiota growth and was paralleled by markedly reducing its promotion of colon mass b and 4c.hfd-induced metabolic syndrome is itself known to be largely dependent upon the presence of a microbiota   particularly in gf mice thus making it difficult to discern the extent to which amelioration of such a phenotype by a particular treatment is also dependent upon the microbiota.

thus inulin but not cellulose promotes enterocyte proliferation which correlates with protection against hfd-induced metabolic syndrome.inulin restored hfd-induced microbiota depletion and host-microbiota separation at the mucosal surface obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with alterations in intestinal microbiota composition in both mice and humans including an increase in the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes and increases in relative abundance of proteobacteria .

lastly in accord with the general notion that increased colonic mass is generally protective against metabolic syndrome we note that over a range of experimental conditions colon mass negatively correlates with fasting blood glucose concentration j. to further investigate the role of inulin-induced changes in microbiota in impacting the gut and influencing metabolic parameters fecal microbiota transplants were performed.

that these effects were of modest magnitude and significance might reflect that the inulin-induced alterations in microbiota are not fully maintained when mice are fed a chow diet but are nonetheless in accord with the notion that such alterations play a role in mediating inulin's impact on the gut and metabolic phenotype.manipulation of scfa levels in intestine did not impact colonic health or adiposity induced by hfd enriched with cellulose or inulinnext we examined the mechanism by which the microbiota mediate inulin's restoration of colon mass and amelioration of metabolic syndrome.

together these results indicate that inulin impacts microbiota to induce expression of il-22 which fortifies the intestine resulting in reduced microbiota encroachment and pro-inflammatory gene expres- sion which together may underlie inulin's protection against hfd-induced metabolic syndrome.discussionthe central goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanism whereby enrichment of an obesogenic hfd with inulin sup- presses adiposity and its associated parameters of metabolic syndrome.

thus fermentable fiber protects against metabolic syndrome by nourishing microbiota to restore il-22-mediated enterocyte function.introductionobesity and its associated metabolic disorders collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome are among humanity's most pressing public health problems  .

while there are a myriad of potential means by which these and other inulin-induced changes in microbiota might ameliorate metabolic disease we hypothesize that reducing microbiota encroachment plays a central role in this process.

the need for such studies notwithstanding our results indicate that scfas may not be a limiting factor in the microbiota-dependent ability of inulin to protect against hfd-induced metabolic syndrome.it should be noted that although inulin restored total gut bacterial loads it did not restore microbiota composition toward that of chow-fed mice but rather resulted in a microbiota composition seemingly equally distinct from chow- and hfd- fed mice at least as assessed by unbiased metrics such as unifrac analysis.

we speculate that such effects on the epithelium result in an enhanced shield from the microbiota protect against an array of inflammatory challenges and in particular underlie inulin's and recombinant il-22's protection against hfd-induced metabolic syndrome.starmethodsdetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the followingd d d b mice and dietsd b food consumption measurementsb scfa treatmentb glucose measurementb assays for cholesterol triglyceride and ffab germ-free gf mice experimentsb microbiota transplantationb bacteria localization by fish stainingb rna isolation and qrt-pcrb hematoxylin and eosin stainingb immunohistochemistryb oil red o stainingb brdu stainingb elisab bacterial quantification in feces and liverb isolation of intestinal epithelial cellsb short-chain fatty acids analysisb 16s rrna gene sequence analysisd d supplemental informationsupplemental information includes seven figures and two tables and can be found with this article online at .acknowledgmentsthis work was supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases grants dk099071 dk083890 and ca219144.
