In contrast enrichment of HFD with cellulose has a relatively mild impact on microbiota composition.While mechanisms by which alterations in microbiota alter metabolic phenotype of the host are not well understood we have shown that both mice and humans with dysglycemia exhibit microbiota that infiltrate the mucus layer to attain a close prox- imity to host cells .

That these effects were of modest magnitude and significance might reflect that the inulin-induced alterations in microbiota are not fully maintained when mice are fed a chow diet but are nonetheless in accord with the notion that such alterations play a role in mediating inulin's impact on the gut and metabolic phenotype.Manipulation of SCFA Levels in Intestine Did Not Impact Colonic Health or Adiposity Induced by HFD Enriched with Cellulose or InulinNext we examined the mechanism by which the microbiota mediate inulin's restoration of colon mass and amelioration of metabolic syndrome.

Together these results indicate that inulin impacts microbiota to induce expression of IL-22 which fortifies the intestine resulting in reduced microbiota encroachment and pro-inflammatory gene expres- sion which together may underlie inulin's protection against HFD-induced metabolic syndrome.DISCUSSIONThe central goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanism whereby enrichment of an obesogenic HFD with inulin sup- presses adiposity and its associated parameters of metabolic syndrome.

We observed that analogous to our results with GF mice antibiotic treatment greatly reduced the ability of inulin to promote microbiota growth and was paralleled by markedly reducing its promotion of colon mass B and 4C.HFD-induced metabolic syndrome is itself known to be largely dependent upon the presence of a microbiota   particularly in GF mice thus making it difficult to discern the extent to which amelioration of such a phenotype by a particular treatment is also dependent upon the microbiota.

Together these results indicate that inulin's promo- tion of colon mass and improvement of metabolic syndrome are not largely mediated by SCFA production.Inulin Restoration of Colonic and Metabolic Health Is Dependent on IL-22 We next began to consider other potential mechanisms whereby inulin might impact the microbiota to promote epithelial cell pro- liferation and production of antimicrobial gene expression that together might reduce HFD-induced microbiota encroachment and associated parameters of metabolic syndrome.

Rather HFD decimates gut microbiota resulting in loss of enterocyte proliferation leading to microbiota encroachment low-grade inflammation LGI and metabolic syn- drome.

Thus fermentable fiber protects against metabolic syndrome by nourishing microbiota to restore IL-22-mediated enterocyte function.INTRODUCTIONObesity and its associated metabolic disorders collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome are among humanity's most pressing public health problems  .
