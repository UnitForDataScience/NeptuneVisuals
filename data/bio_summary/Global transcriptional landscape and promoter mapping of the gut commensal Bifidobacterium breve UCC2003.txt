Of these Bbr1328 belongs to the COG3601 family ofriboflavin transport while Bbr1329 constitutes an ABC transporter and ATPase of a putative ECF suggest- ing the involvement of these genes and FMN riboswith in the transport of this particular B vitamin.In the case of TPP-sensing riboswitch or T-box we assigned it to an expressed 5'-UTR region of an operon involved in thiamine biosynthesis Bbr0674-77 sug- gesting also in this case its involvement in the regulation of these genes Additional file Figure S5 panel b.Finally in the case of the YKOK leader or M-box Mg2 metal-sensingRNA we identified this element in an expressed region located at the 5'-UTR of an ABC trans- porter Bbr0406-07 where the permease-encoding gene Bbr0407 belongs to the category COG4986 of inorganic ion transport suggesting also in this case the involvement of these genes in bacterial metal ion homeostasis Additional file Figure S5 panel c.Altogether these observations show the expression of a number of housekeeping RNAs and regulatory RNA elements in B. breve suggesting the possibility of a new level of RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression also in members of this genus.ConclusionsComparison of transcriptomic data obtained by tiling ar- rays and RNA-Seq showed reproducibility between these two technologies but also revealed the benefit of using a combination of these two approaches in investigating gene expression.

It also showed that there may be other strategies of transcriptional termination respon- sible for modulating gene expression in B. breve.Furthermore the alignment of our dataset with a re- cently published study on the essential genes of B. breve demonstered how the vast majority of those also appear to be expressed in our dataset in particular those house- keeping genes of which orthologues can be found across the Bifidobacterium genus.Finally our analysis also allowed the identification of a number housekeeping sRNAs and regulatory RNA ele- ments not previously identified in B. breve UCC2003 or other bifidobacterial species indicating that RNA- mediated regulation of gene expression also occurs in this organism and genus.

RNA concentration and puritywere evaluated by Picodrop microlitre Spectrophotom- eter Picodrop UK.For RNA sequencing 2.5 mg of total RNA was treated by the Ribo-Zero Magnetic kit Illumina to remove ribosomal RNA followed by purification of the rRNA- depleted sample by ethanol precipitation.

Our findings therefore indicate that also in bifidobacteria convergent transcription is a strategy to modulate gene expression.The transcriptome analysis performed in this study also allowed an investigation into the main features asso- ciated with TUs in B. breve which may also apply to bifidobacteria in general.

Bacterial RNA was directly labelled follow- ing isolation without cDNA synthesis with Cy5 red channel using the Kreatech Agilent RNA labeling kit EA-023.

RNA was further purified by phenol extraction and etha- nol precipitation Quality and integrity of the RNA was checked by the Tape station 2200 Agilent Tech- nologies USA analysis.

Along with CRISPRCas genesRestrictionModification RM systems play a signifi- cant role in evading the acquisition of foreign DNA in B. breve UCC2003 which is equipped with two complete BbrII BbrIII and one partially functioning BbrI systems  Of these three it has been shown that only the methylase component is essential for bacterial survival  We observed that all these genes are transcribed at low level 2 fold above background level in our dataset Bbr0216 Bbr1119 and Bbr1121 apparently ensuring a permanentdefault protection of the bacterial chromosome from their partner endonucleases Additional file Table S3.Housekeeping sRNA transcription and riboswitches in B. breveThe genome-wide transcriptional analysis conducted in this study allowed the annotation of a set of intergenic regions that may encompass sRNAs with housekeeping andor regulatory functions in B. breve such as RNAseP transfer- messenger RNA tmRNA and 4.5S RNA Table .Based on our analysis we assigned RNAseP to a346 bp highly transcribed intergenic region 50 fold with associated promoter and rho-independent termin- ator Additional file Table S2Additional file Figure S4 panel a.
