the early life stages may represent an op- portune time to influence an offspring's health and poten- tial not only by avoiding nutritional insults that have immediate adverse implications but also by establishing healthy eating habits that may be crucially important in preventing pediatric overweightobesity noncommunica- ble diseases and micronutrient deficiencies all of which have increased in prevalence worldwide.overweight and obesity have pervasively increased in all age groups resulting in immediate and long-term health risks.-it is alarming that at least 41 million chil- dren under the age of 5 years are overweight or obese and overweightobesity in females 10-24 years of age in- creased between 1990 and 2013 reaching a prevalence of nearly 1 in 5 young people in countries where noncom- municable diseases are predominant.this poses a seri- ous threat to health from childhood to adulthood.in particular maternal overweight and obesity lead to in- creased maternal morbidity and infant mortality and pe- diatric obesity has become a major contributor to adult obesity diabetes and noncommunicable diseases.noncommunicable diseases comprising mainly car- diovascular disease cancer diabetes and chronic lung dis- ease are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity globally.the number of deaths due to noncommunica- ble diseases has increased from 27 million in 1990 to nearly 38 million in 2013with over 14 million deaths occurring in people between the ages of 30 and 70 years.

critical topics to be addressed in future research and translated into recommendations of public health relevance are also highlighted.introductionpregnancy and infancy comprise the most critical stages for conditioning a human being's health.

75283-97requires infants and toddlers to learn how to eat by achieving oral-motor abilities and sensory experiences.the developmental origins of health and disease paradigm envisions health as being determined by early-life events in utero and infancy when key regula- tory systems are sensitive to immediate environmental exposures that permanently modify the body's struc- ture function immune and metabolic phenotype and consequently the risk of disease.this implies a devel- opmental plasticity through which alternative pheno- types are generated from a specific genotype by adjusting or adapting the developmental program in re- sponse to prevailing environmental cues.

worrisome is the coexistence of under- and overnutri- tion ie the so-called dual burden of malnutrition as in- dividuals may suffer overweight and obesity coupled with micronutrient deficiencies.at expo milano 2015 in milan italy leading ex- perts discussed up-to-date knowledge about the condi- tioning of offspring health through the link between nutritional exposures occurring from conception to the postnatal period and the sensitive critical points involved in lifelong health ie epigenetics and the immune sys- tem with a specific focus on dietary patterns probiotics vitamin d and breastfeeding.

first environmentally sensi- tive critical points involved in lifelong health that is the potential health effects of changes in imprinted gene ex- pression and microbiota determinants to environmental signals ie epigenetic mechanisms and immune system developmentfunction respectively are discussed.

they also had higher methylation of loci within candi- date genes involved in metabolic and cardiovascular disease which differed depending on each individual's gender and gestational timing of exposure.likewise the methylation status of specific cpgs from candidate genes in umbilical cord tissue dna from healthy neo- nates was positively associated with a child's adiposity at age 9 years and was inversely associated with mater- nal carbohydrate intake in early pregnancy.children who were overweightobese at 1 year of age had signifi- cantly higher methylation percentages at the h19 dmr in cord blood leukocyte dna at birth compared with nonobese children.immunological development in infancy and offspring health host-microbe crosstalk from mother to new- born through pregnancy and caregivingthe gut microbiota is one of the early environmental factors that determine adult health.

overall term infants delivered vaginally at home and breastfed exclusively seem to have the most beneficial gut microbiota whereas antibiotic treat- ment and cesarean delivery seem to promote subopti- mal development of the microbiota in early infancy.maternal nutrition and offspring health from conception to the postnatal periodwhen elucidating the potential effects of nutrition on reproductive outcomes the composition of the diet along with the intake of single foods and food com- pounds must be examined since health outcomes are endpoints for different conditions.

interestingly maternal probiotic supplementation with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg during pregnancy and lac- tation not only lowered the risk of atopic eczema in the first 2 years of life in the offspring but also increased the amount of transforming growth factor tgf-b2 in breast milk thus augmenting breast milk's immune- protective potential.on the other hand no effect on atopic dermatitis and eczema was detected in infants 3- to 12-month-old with mild-to-moderate atopicdermatitis who were supplemented with l. rhamnosus ggor in infants given together with their mothers pre- and postnatal supplementation with bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis.indeed when the committee on nutrition of the european society for paediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition evaluated data about the health effects of for- mula supplemented with probiotics andor prebiotics vs unsupplemented formula evidence to recommend the routine use of probiotic-supplemented formula was deemed insufficient despite some clinical benefits asso- ciated with a few probiotics added to infant or follow- on formulas and given beyond early infancy.these conflicting results likely signify that the effects of probi- otics are strain specific and that interventions are most effective if commenced during pregnancy.besides beneficially enhancing the composition of the gut microbiota probiotics may restore increased in- testinal permeability to normal improve the intestine's immunological barrier function and reduce the genera- tion of proinflammatory cytokines.accordingly ma- ternal probiotic supplementation with b. lactis or b. lactis th l. rhamnosus gg significantly modulated the expression of toll-like receptor tlr-related genes in both placenta and the fetal gut.probiotics also appear to beneficially influence glucose metabolism and weight gain in pregnant women.maternal supplementation with mixed lactobacillibifidobacteria from the first tri- mester of pregnancy to the end of exclusive breastfeed- ing resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus as well as the risk of mater- nal central adiposity over the 12-month postpartum pe- riod.probiotics are postulated to be involved in the control of body weight and energy metabolism through modulation of both energy homeostasis and the low- grade inflammatory state that characterizes overweight obesity and the onset of metabolic disorders such as in- sulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.on the basis of the currently available literaturepre- peri- and postnatal interventions with specific probiotic preparations may have potentially beneficial effects on child health and well-being.

75283-97 93as practical recommendations pregnant women should be encouraged to eat a balanced diet and to lower their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and pro- cessed meats as suggested by current national and in- ternational dietary guidelines and should consume 200 g of fatty fish per week to reach the recommended intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids while remaining below the tolerable upper intake for contaminants.there is evidence to suggest that ma- ternal vitamin d status may have important short- and long-term influences on both a pregnant woman's health and the health of her offspring.
