However for the APPPS1 mice by comparing the Shannon and Simpson indices from the 3- 6- and 8-months old groups Shannon 6.125.59 and 5.39 p  0.01 Simpson 0.97 0.95 and 0.94 p  0.02 it was found that the alpha diver- sity of the APPPS1 mice microbiota decreased with increased age while this trend was not observed in the WT mice groups.Figure 4 shows the 20 most abundant bacte- rial families in the gut microbiota of APPPS1 and C57BL6 mice in the 3- 6- to 8-months old groups.

Further comparative analysis found a new species Cori- obacteriaceae significantly more abundant in 6- and 8-month-old APPPS1 mice than that in the age-matched WT mice at the family level and Ruminococcus being significantly abundant in WTmice than in APPPS1 mice at the genus level.In addition to explore the effect of age we com- pared the gut microbiota abundance in the three groups of APPPS1 mice.

The present study aims to compare the gut microbiota in APPPS1 transgenic mice of AD and C57Bl6 wild-type WT mice by pyrosequencing the V3 and V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes.

The 3- 6- and 8-month-old APPPS1 and WT mice were used to explore the effects of age on the gut microbiota.

Third the microbiota diversity of APPPS1 mice decreased with increased age.

Fourth further inspection showed that the abundance of Helicobacteraceae and Desulfovibrionaceae at the family level and Odoribacter and Helicobacter at the genus level increased significantly in APPPS1 mice than in WT mice while Prevotella abundance in WT mice was significantly higher than in APPPS1 mice.

More human studies are warranted to explore the potential of gut microbiota as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic target for AD.Keywords 16S ribosomal RNA Alzheimer's disease APPPS1 mice gut microbiotaINTRODUCTIONAs the most common form of dementia among the elderly Alzheimer's disease AD is expected to have rising prevalence with the aging demograph- ics of human society worldwide 1-3.

In this study we conducted comparative analyses on the gut microbiota of APPswePS1dE9 APPPS1 mice a well-established mouse model of familial AD and that of wild-type WT C57Bl6 mice.

1 there was no obvious difference in escape latency between 3-month-old APPPS1 and WT mice indicating that 3-month-old APPPS1 mice had no impaired spatial learning compared with WT mice.

Thus impaired spatial learning appeared in the 6-month-old APPPS1 mice and was further aggravated in the 8-month-old group.To assess the spatial memory changes in APPPS1 mice the percent time in the target quadrant  in the spatial probe test was recorded.
