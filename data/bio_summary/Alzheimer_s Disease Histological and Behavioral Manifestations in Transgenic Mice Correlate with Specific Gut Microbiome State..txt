However for the APPPS1 mice by comparing the Shannon and Simpson indices from the 3- 6- and 8-months old groups Shannon 6.125.59 and 5.39 p  0.01 Simpson 0.97 0.95 and 0.94 p  0.02 it was found that the alpha diver- sity of the APPPS1 mice microbiota decreased with increased age while this trend was not observed in the WT mice groups.Figure 4 shows the 20 most abundant bacte- rial families in the gut microbiota of APPPS1 and C57BL6 mice in the 3- 6- to 8-months old groups.

found that an axenic mouse model of AD without gut microbiota exhibited a drastic reductionof cerebral Af3 amyloid pathology when compared to controls with intestinal microbiota which suggests a microbial involvement in the development of AD pathology 27.

More mechanis- tic studies are needed to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the association between gut microbiota alteration and AD.Moreover in addition to the concept of gut micro- biota as a potential therapeutic target as discussed in many studies 29 30 it has been proposed that gut microbiota alteration in AD will help better eluci- date the pharmacology of many agents.

In recent years many studies indicated the association of gut microbiota changes with metabolic diseases.

However the gut microbiota of AD has not been investigated.

The present study aims to compare the gut microbiota in APPPS1 transgenic mice of AD and C57Bl6 wild-type WT mice by pyrosequencing the V3 and V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes.

The 3- 6- and 8-month-old APPPS1 and WT mice were used to explore the effects of age on the gut microbiota.

Third the microbiota diversity of APPPS1 mice decreased with increased age.

More human studies are warranted to explore the potential of gut microbiota as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic target for AD.Keywords 16S ribosomal RNA Alzheimer's disease APPPS1 mice gut microbiotaINTRODUCTIONAs the most common form of dementia among the elderly Alzheimer's disease AD is expected to have rising prevalence with the aging demograph- ics of human society worldwide 1-3.
