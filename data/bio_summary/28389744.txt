The prevalence of HLA DQ2 DQ8 alleles was not increased in patients with IgAN  .MALT as a possible target for treatment in IgAN the NEFIGAN trialThe role of MALT in IgAN suggests the possible benefi- cial benefits of a drug targeted to the mucosal Blymphocytes in Peyer's patches which are supposed to be primed to produce Gd-IgA1 the initial step in the path- ogenesis of IgAN .

In a study of a large cohort of European subjects with IgAN the VALIGA cohort a sub-analysis of patients who had tonsillectomy be- fore or after the diagnosis of IgAN failed to prove a protective role on IgAN progression also in propensity matched case- control groups .

In another study a genetically disrupted tolerance was crucial for the develop- ment of IgAN in transgenic animals carrying a dysregulation of LIGHT lymphotoxin-like inducible protein which devel- op intestinal inflammation and high levels of pIgA .The role played by intestinal microbe exposure in subjects at genetic risk of developing IgAN was proposed by the au- thors of a genome-wide association study GWAS which showed an association between IgAN and genes involved in immunity against intestinal pathogens .

This mechanism correlates with systemic inflammation and oxidative stress .The gut-kidney axis in IgAN the role of dietThe relationship between GALT and IgAN was originally suggested some 30 years ago by the seminal experimental work of Steven Emancipator  who demonstrated the development of IgAN in mice orally immunized with al- imentary components including ovalbumin bovine gam- ma globulin and horse spleen ferritin.

Based on these results the authors concluded that an early gluten-free diet abolishes IgAN development hematuria and proteinuria in alpha1KI-CD89Tg mice and suggested that this mechanism might also be active in human IgAN.The effect of a gluten-free diet in this recent experimental model of IgAN in mice is similar to that which our group reported several years ago in pilot studies in patients with IgAN.

In 30 of patients with IgAN a rectal mucosal patch to test inflammatory reaction to alimentary antigens in- duced increased production of nitric oxide and release of myeloperoxidase together with increases in IgA anti-gliadin and other alimentary components.Relationship between IgAN intestinal chronic diseases and celiac diseaseAn increased intestinal permeability as detected by the 51Cr- EDTA ethylene-diamino-tetracetic acid test is a frequent find- ing in pediatric and adult patients with IgAN and it was report- ed to be associated with increased levels of IgA directed against alimentary antigens    suggesting exposure to immu- nogenic alimentary antigens and breakdown of oral tolerance.

This aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 rep- resents the first step in the multi-hit pathogenesis of IgAN and is a biomarker of this disease  .The site of mucosal immunity activation in IgANWhen we consider mucosal immunity and IgAN the better proof of concept seems to be the manifestation of macroscopic hematuria in combination with acute tonsillitis  .

To summarize most studies indicate that tonsillar mucosal immunity plays a role in some patients with IgAN but not in the vast majority of such patients and that it does not seem to affect remission or a better outcome of this disease.The gut-kidney axis in IgAN the role of genes and environmentThe search for specific mucosal microbes eliciting IgA syn- thesis has been largely inconclusive .

The results of this GWAS support the hypothesis that genetics epigenetics and environmental factors may interact in induc- ing functional modifications to the intestinal mucosal immune system that favor the development of IgAN.The gut-kidney axis in IgAN the role of intestinal microbesThe results of the GWAS reported above focused new interest on gut microbes in the clinical setting of IgAN.

In this experimental model of mice genetically predisposed to IgAN the contact between alimentary components and intestinal mi- crobiota triggers the IgA response and mesangial deposits.The role of GALT and intestinal microbiota in the develop- ment of experimental IgAN was elegantly demonstrated in transgenic mice overexpressing BAFF BAFF-Tg mice the potent B-cell survival factor which together with APRIL is crucial for IgA synthesis .
