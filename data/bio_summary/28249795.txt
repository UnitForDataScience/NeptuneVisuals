At weaning S pigs ha higher numbers of Prevotella and several firmicutes genera Clostridium and Clostridium clusters XI and XIVb Faecalibacterium Coprococcus Blautia Oscillibacter Butyricioccoccus Peptostreptococcacceae and Veillonella .At day 35 C pigs had higher Bacteroides and other Bacter- oidetes Clostridium XIVb and Enterobacteriaceae while S pigs had higher Prevotella Faecalibacterium Megasphaera Veillonellaceae and Acidaminococacceae .

The fact that S pigs maintained significantly higher numbers of butyrate-producing clostridia from W to EON supports our hypothesis on the benefit of soil exposure by improved immune function andor energy harvest.Besides butyrate producers S pigs also had significantly higher number of other SCFAs producing bacteria and genera generally associated with beneficial properties such as Blautia Veillonella and different Clostridia members.

Approximately 1 kg of topsoil from Tontitown AR Sod Store INC. was placed and maintained throughout the 17 day into flat containers in S pigs farrowing crates for unrestricted rooting.At weaning unisex littermates were penned together in groups of 10 total of 10 pens and 50 pigs per treatment and were all subjected to identical growing conditions no more soil exposure until marketing.

In the present study at W 21 days S pigs microbiota possessed higher diversity comparing to C pigs in term of richness when they have significantly higher observed species as well as Chao index.

Cloacibacillus were relatively abundant during the lactation phase while Treponema appeared at weaning with numbers fading after day35.Impact of soil exposure on gut microbiota structure and dynamicsDuring the lactation phase soil exposure had no significant impact on gut microbiota diversity.

Specifically pigs from 20 litters were assigned to either control treatments C or soil treatments S pigs exposed to topsoil from day 4 postpartum to the end of lactation.

At day 55 and 96 the composition were similar with a trend for lower Bacteroidetes and higher Firmicutes in S pigs .Multivariate analyses at the genus level indicated significant differences in the gut microbiota trajectories in developing piglets depending on soil exposure .

At the end of the growth period day 96 S pigs had higher Faecalibacterium .DiscussionIn this study we observed that exposure to soil increased the10.90.80.70.60.50.40.3Verrucomicrobia Synergistetes Spirochaetes Proteobacteria Lentisphaerae Fusobacteria Firmicutes Fibrobacteres Elusimicrobia Bacteroidetes Actinobacteria0.20.10L1L2WT1WT2MNT1MNT2EONT1EONT2GT1GT2Fig.

Indeed it was reported that the piglets exposed to soil in this study had significantly higher body weight BW 2.21 kg more p  0.05 at the end of-nursery despite having lower BW at weaning 6.87 vs. 7.40 kg P  0.05.

Pigs exposed to soil tended to have higher BW at end of growth 4.6 kg resulting in significantly higher average daily gain throughout the nursery period 0.42 vs.0.35 kgd P  0.01 .
