Based on the numbers of mites on the bottom boards the hives were clas- sified into three categories of varroosis per hive level 1 0-- 50 mites low Varroa infestation VDI1 level 2 51--100 mites moderate Varroa infestation VDI2 and level 3 101 or more mites high Varroa infestation VDI3.

For Varroa VDI.3 represents a level 3 infestation of 101 mites a high- Varroa infestation VDI.2 represents a level 2 infestation of between 51 and 100 mites moderate-Varroa no infestation has no significant effectTriplot Visualization of Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates-4-202ax1 6.0Lactobacillus mellis Firm 4 OTU8 and Bifidobacterium indicum Bifido OTU11.Positively correlated with a high infestation of Varroa VDI3 were those OTUs with positive scores on both axes Lactobacillus helsingborgensis Firm 5 OTU5 Lactobacillus kullabergensis OTU9 Shigella dysenteriae OTU20 Morganella morganii OTU18 L. kunkeei OTU16 S. alvi OTU7 and Commensalibacter intestini OTU4.The last group was formed by OTUs with a negative score on ax1 and positive on ax2 which were positively associated with N. apis presence NAI3 Paenibacillus larvae OTU12 and one type of G. apicola gamma 1 OTU 62 Table S4.The Effect of Time of Year Location and Parasites on the Bacteriome at the Population LevelAt the population level the relative abundance of bacteria was compared using METASTATS and visualized using a heat map.

Allof the studied beehives were infested with Varroa but the level of Varroa infestation differed considerably among hives Table .The Effect of Parasites and Other Environmental Factors on the Honey Bee BacteriomeThe bacterial 16S rRNA gene library contained 1858850 sequences that formed 86 OTUs97 Table S3.

The first model contained only Varroa infestation 1000 per- mutations F  1.61 P  0.019 whereas the second had Varroa infestation and N. apis infection 1000 permutations F  1.61 P  0.003.

The observed likely antagonistic interac- tions of these bacteria in the bacteriome in response to the level of varroosis probably indicate a different function of each taxon in the bee gut.In a previous study we showed that Arsenophonus and Spiroplasma are shared among the bacteriomes of Varroa and honey bees and we suggested the passive transport of these bacteria through Varroa feeding .

We examined the effects of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor the fungal pathogens Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae and the try- panosome Lotmaria passim.

Varroa was detected by acaricid- al treatment Nosema and L. passim by PCR and the bacteriome using MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Location time of year and degree of infestation by Varroa had signifi- cant effects on the composition of the bacteriome of honey beeElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article doi7 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.
