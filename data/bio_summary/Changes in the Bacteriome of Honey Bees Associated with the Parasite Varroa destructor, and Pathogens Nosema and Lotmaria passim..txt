indirect ef- fects may also occur as these parasitic mites influence the physiology and immunity of their hosts.in this study we investigated the influence of varroa and the eukaryotic parasites nosema and lotmaria on the bacteriome of honey bees on bee samples collected in 2014. we examined how several characteristics of honey bee colo- nies including losses in czechia in the winter of 20142015 and varroa infestation at the time of sample collection influ- ence the symbiotic bacterial community of honey bees.

in the colonies with high varroa infesta- tion levels varroosis the relative abundance of the bacteria bartonella apis and lactobacillus apis decreased.

l. apis has been previously described in gut contents and has showed an inhibitory ac- tivity against the bacterial disease p. larvae .the observed bartonella sequences were identical 99  to the newly described b. apis from honey bees .

previously we foundthe bacteria arsenophonus morganella spiroplasma enterococcus and pseudomonas in varroa mites  and suggested that the mite shares these bacteria with honey bees within the colony .the gut of honey bee adults is also inhabited by a range of eukaryotic endoparasites including nosema ceranae nosema apis apicystis bombi and crithidia mellificae .

in contrast to the other lactobacillus species the relative abun- dance of l. apis decreased with increasing varroa abun- dance in bees in our dataset.

our results are in accordance with previous studies that have indicated that geographical location and time of year can influence the bacteriome of honey bees and also bumble bees   .based on the statistical correlations we found varroosis substantially more important factor than n. ceranae n. apis and l. passim to influence the honey bee bacteriome.

based on the numbers of mites on the bottom boards the hives were clas- sified into three categories of varroosis per hive level 1 0-- 50 mites low varroa infestation vdi1 level 2 51--100 mites moderate varroa infestation vdi2 and level 3 101 or more mites high varroa infestation vdi3.

the observed likely antagonistic interac- tions of these bacteria in the bacteriome in response to the level of varroosis probably indicate a different function of each taxon in the bee gut.in a previous study we showed that arsenophonus and spiroplasma are shared among the bacteriomes of varroa and honey bees and we suggested the passive transport of these bacteria through varroa feeding .

there is some evidence that n. ceranae is more virulent than n. apis  although other work has in- dicated n. apis and n. ceranae to have similar virulence in laboratory tests .
