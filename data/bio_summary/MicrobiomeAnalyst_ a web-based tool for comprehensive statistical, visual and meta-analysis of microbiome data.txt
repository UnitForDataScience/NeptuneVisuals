based on the detailed comparisons among those web-based tools table  it is evident that micro- biomeanalyst offers a unique set of features and functions with regards to comprehensive statistical data analysis and visualization metabolic network visual analysis taxon set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis.limitations and future directionsthe data processing and statistical methods in mdp and sdp modules can be used for analysis and visualization of data for both human and environmental microbiome studies.

microbiomeanalyst contains four modulesthe marker data profiling module offers various options for community profiling comparative anal- ysis and functional prediction based on 16s rrna marker gene data the shotgun data profiling module supports exploratory data analysis functional pro- filing and metabolic network visualization of shot- gun metagenomics or metatranscriptomics data the taxon set enrichment analysis module helps inter- pret taxonomic signatures via enrichment analysis against 300 taxon sets manually curated from litera- ture and public databases finally the projection with public data module allows users to visually explore their data with a public reference data for pattern dis- covery and biological insights.

the key fea- tures of microbiomeanalyst includesupport for a wide array of common as well as advanced methods for taxonomic diversity analysis functional pro- filing visualization and significance testingcomprehensive support for various data filtering and transformation methods coupled with well-established as well as more recent algorithms for differential abundance analysisa powerful fully-featured metabolic network visualiza- tion framework for intuitive exploration of results from functional profilingsupport for meta-analysis with compatible public datasets for context reference and pattern discovery using 3d visual analyticsenrichment analysis based on 300 taxon sets manually collected from literature and public databases.microbiomeanalyst also contains a comprehensive list of frequently asked questions faqs and tutorials to help researchers easily navigate different analysis tasks.

for most researchers their primary challenge in data analysis is how to make sense of the abundance tables or biom files within the con- text of different experimental factors or study conditions.microbiome data analysis can be placed into four gen- eral categories i taxonomic profiling - to characterize community compositions based on methods developed in ecology such as alpha-diversity within-sample diversity or beta-diversity between-sample diversity ii functional profiling - to assign genes into different functional groups i.e.

in addition with the increasing number of public datasets and our growing knowledge about microbiome it is now possible to perform meta-analyses to reveal larger pictures or novel insights be- yond a single study such as using compatible public datasets for contextualizing new experiments  pooling new data with existing cohorts for increased power  or compar- ing microbial signatures with those reported from other studies .to address these gaps as well as to meet new requests aris- ing from current microbiome data analysis we have devel- oped microbiomeanalyst a web-based program to allow clinical and basic scientists to easily perform exploratory analysis on common abundance profiles and taxonomic sig- natures generated from microbiome studies.

it is also used for those comparative analysis methods without a known pref- erence for certain normalization procedures such as uni- variate statistics and linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse.

such a list can be those significant features identified in differen- tial abundance analysis or those exhibiting similar behav- iors based on clustering analysis.

the focus has shifted toward down- stream statistical analysis and functional interpreta- tion.

here we introduce microbiomeanalyst a user- friendly tool that integrates recent progress in statis- tics and visualization techniques coupled with novel knowledge bases to enable comprehensive analysis of common data outputs produced from microbiome studies.

metabolic pathways or biological processes to under- stand their collective functional capacities iii comparative analysis - to identify features that are significantly differ- ent among conditions under study and iv meta-analysis- to integrate user data with public data or knowledge accumulated for improved statistical power or biological understanding.

these unique characteris- tics have made it inappropriate to directly apply methods developed in other omics fields to perform comparative analysis on microbiome data.

for instance the metagenomeseq algorithm integrates cumulative-sum scal- ing css method and a statistical model based on the zero- inflated gaussian zig distribution to improve the power for differential abundance analysis of microbiome data .

in particular the phyloseq package has been developed to provide a unified framework to al- low r users to explore different statistical algorithms formicrobiome data analysis .

there is an urgent demand for user-friendly tools that support these recent approaches for comprehensive statistical analysis of microbiome data.

collec- tively these features consist of comprehensive tool suites for microbiome data analysis.
