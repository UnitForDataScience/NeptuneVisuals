In addition PCA and hierarchical clustering clearly separated samples from mice fed a chow diet from LFD mice.

Animal models for human disease such as mutant mice provide the possibility to reproduce genetic predisposition to disease thereby allowing in-depth analysis of metabolic and biochemical functions.

For this we fed C57Bl6N mice a grain-based chow or a purified low-fat diet thereby modifying the emission of methanol in breath whereas acetone levels were unaffected.

Our findings are a first step to the systemic mapping of VOC patterns to metabolic functions in mice because differences between VOCs could be traced to different sources in the body.

For such approaches stable iso- tope-labeled substrates were administered in mice to follow up specific VOCs Sinues et al .

Evidently mammalian model organisms such as laboratory rats or the C57BL6N mouse facilitated pilot work in this field Aprea et al  Szymczak et al  Huppe et al  Kistler et al  Sinues et al .We investigated systemic VOC distribution in organs blood feces urine and breath of male C57BL 6N mice that were fed a purified low-fat experimental diet or standard laboratory chow.

By using such a system-wide approach the so far largely unex- plored links between several tissues and VOCs that finally contribute to the sum signal presented in breath can be investigated and mapped to metabolic functions.Material and methodsAnimal housing and diet regimesMale mice n34 were housed in type IIL poly- carbonate cages with individual ventilation Tecni- plast Italy in specific pathogen-free conditions at the German Mouse Clinic GMC Fuchs et al .

All mice had ad libitum access to pelleted laboratory chow no.

From the age of 32 weeks on mice were randomly assigned to either continued chow diet feeding or a semi-purified LFD low fat E 15000-04 Ssniff Soest Germany for a period of 3 weeks until the VOC analysis measurements were conducted.

All experiments were performed following animal welfare regulations supervised by the district government of Upper Bavaria Regierung von Oberbayern.Analysis of VOCs from ad libitum fed mice was performed between 7 am and 1 pm.
