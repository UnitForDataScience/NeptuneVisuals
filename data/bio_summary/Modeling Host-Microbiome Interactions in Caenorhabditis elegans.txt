caenorhabditis elegans is one of the simplest multicellular model organisms that has been developed to investigate different biological processes including development neurobiology host- pathogen interactions and aging to name a few sifri et al.

we emphasize interactions between microbes and the host that may also benefit c. elegans as reviews on host- pathogen interactions in c. elegans have been recently published irazoqui et al.
