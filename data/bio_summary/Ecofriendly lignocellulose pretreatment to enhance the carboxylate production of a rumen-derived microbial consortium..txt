Here the impact of four dry-pretreatment conditions on the microbial transformation of wheat straw was assessed milling to 2 mm and 100 mm and NaOH chemical impregnation at high sub- strate concentrations combined with milling at 2 mm and 100 mm.

The total organiccarbon TOC content of the liquid fraction was measured using awhere D mm is the pore diameter S the solute water surface tension DP the suction pressure MPa used to measure the ratio water heldpore volume.Water absorption at different suction pressures used to explore different pore diameters was determined by presoaking wheat straw samples overnight at 4 degC and transferring the equivalent of 0.2-0.3 g dry wheat straw as hydrated fibers into dialysis bags 6-8 kDa cutoff 32 mm diameter Visking R dialysis bag PolyLabo Strasbourg France.

Finally our results indicate a correlation between lignocellulose macroporosity and its degradability by a hydrolytic microbial consortium.Materials and methodsWheat strawA 20 kg batch of wheat straw Koreli variety grown on an INRA- owned experimental farm Boissy-le-Repos France was harvested in August 2011 milled to 2 mm using a knife mill Retsch SM 100 Germany and stored at room temperature 20-25 degC until use as the for all the experiments hereafter referred to as 2 mm wheat straw biomass A.Dry chemical pretreatmentSodium hydroxide NaOH was dissolved in distilled water 5 g in 20 mL.

One unit of CMCase or 1 unit of xylanase activity UA unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 mmol of reducing sugars per minute.Results and discussionThe impact of dry pretreatment on the kinetics of wheat straw degradation and carboxylate production by a microbial consortium RWS was assessed using four different pretreated wheat straws.

More- over it is important to underline that D was first chemically pre- treated and then milled because this sequence is expected to reduce the energy demand associated with milling and increase biomass component extractability .Characterization of the pretreated wheat strawThe energy consumption associated with the production of A was 223.3 kJ.kg-1 while the production of B required 2.8 times more energy .

This makes pre- diction more difficult but suggests that B 100 mm particle size might be less amenable to microbial bioconversion.Fermentation of the pretreated wheat straw by the microbial consortium RWSWheat straw degradation and VFA production by RWSWheat straw A to D were anaerobically fermented by the RWS consortium.

Compared to raw wheat straw the opti- mal pretreatment was dry milling to 100 mm combined to alkaline impregnation which procured a greater than twofold increase in VFA production rate.
