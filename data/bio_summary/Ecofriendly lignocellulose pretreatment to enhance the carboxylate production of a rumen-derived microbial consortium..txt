The total organiccarbon TOC content of the liquid fraction was measured using awhere D mm is the pore diameter S the solute water surface tension DP the suction pressure MPa used to measure the ratio water heldpore volume.Water absorption at different suction pressures used to explore different pore diameters was determined by presoaking wheat straw samples overnight at 4 degC and transferring the equivalent of 0.2-0.3 g dry wheat straw as hydrated fibers into dialysis bags 6-8 kDa cutoff 32 mm diameter Visking R dialysis bag PolyLabo Strasbourg France.

More- over it is important to underline that D was first chemically pre- treated and then milled because this sequence is expected to reduce the energy demand associated with milling and increase biomass component extractability .Characterization of the pretreated wheat strawThe energy consumption associated with the production of A was 223.3 kJ.kg-1 while the production of B required 2.8 times more energy .

This makes pre- diction more difficult but suggests that B 100 mm particle size might be less amenable to microbial bioconversion.Fermentation of the pretreated wheat straw by the microbial consortium RWSWheat straw degradation and VFA production by RWSWheat straw A to D were anaerobically fermented by the RWS consortium.

Here the impact of four dry-pretreatment conditions on the microbial transformation of wheat straw was assessed milling to 2 mm and 100 mm and NaOH chemical impregnation at high sub- strate concentrations combined with milling at 2 mm and 100 mm.

Samples A and C were milled to 2 mm B and D to 100 mm and C and D were submitted to 5 ww NaOH impregnation at high LC solids.

Finally our results indicate a correlation between lignocellulose macroporosity and its degradability by a hydrolytic microbial consortium.Materials and methodsWheat strawA 20 kg batch of wheat straw Koreli variety grown on an INRA- owned experimental farm Boissy-le-Repos France was harvested in August 2011 milled to 2 mm using a knife mill Retsch SM 100 Germany and stored at room temperature 20-25 degC until use as the for all the experiments hereafter referred to as 2 mm wheat straw biomass A.Dry chemical pretreatmentSodium hydroxide NaOH was dissolved in distilled water 5 g in 20 mL.

The biochemical analysis of residual wheat straw revealed that only the holocellulose fraction was degraded irre- spective of the pretreatment applied meaning that the lignin con-PretreatmentSize mm D50Energy kJ.kg-1A2 mm-223.34B100 mm115.87 - 3.24635.23C2 mm - NaOH-223.34D100 mm - NaOH91.54 - 2.24327.45centration was unchanged throughout the experiment average lignin concentration of 4.35 - 0.55 g.L-1 for all reactors and sam- pling times representing 21.7 - 2.75 ww of the initial substrates data not show.

One unit of CMCase or 1 unit of xylanase activity UA unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 mmol of reducing sugars per minute.Results and discussionThe impact of dry pretreatment on the kinetics of wheat straw degradation and carboxylate production by a microbial consortium RWS was assessed using four different pretreated wheat straws.

Saccharification with commercial enzymesSaccharification of the four treated wheat straw samples A to D was evaluated using a commercial enzymatic mixture Celluclast1.5 L Novozyme.
