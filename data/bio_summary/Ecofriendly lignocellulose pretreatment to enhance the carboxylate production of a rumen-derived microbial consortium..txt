here the impact of four dry-pretreatment conditions on the microbial transformation of wheat straw was assessed milling to 2 mm and 100 mm and naoh chemical impregnation at high sub- strate concentrations combined with milling at 2 mm and 100 mm.

the biochemical analysis of residual wheat straw revealed that only the holocellulose fraction was degraded irre- spective of the pretreatment applied meaning that the lignin con-pretreatmentsize mm d50energy kj.kg-1a2 mm-223.34b100 mm115.87 - 3.24635.23c2 mm - naoh-223.34d100 mm - naoh91.54 - 2.24327.45centration was unchanged throughout the experiment average lignin concentration of 4.35 - 0.55 g.l-1 for all reactors and sam- pling times representing 21.7 - 2.75 ww of the initial substrates data not show.

finally our results indicate a correlation between lignocellulose macroporosity and its degradability by a hydrolytic microbial consortium.materials and methodswheat strawa 20 kg batch of wheat straw koreli variety grown on an inra- owned experimental farm boissy-le-repos france was harvested in august 2011 milled to 2 mm using a knife mill retsch sm 100 germany and stored at room temperature 20-25 degc until use as the for all the experiments hereafter referred to as 2 mm wheat straw biomass a.dry chemical pretreatmentsodium hydroxide naoh was dissolved in distilled water 5 g in 20 ml.

the total organiccarbon toc content of the liquid fraction was measured using awhere d mm is the pore diameter s the solute water surface tension dp the suction pressure mpa used to measure the ratio water heldpore volume.water absorption at different suction pressures used to explore different pore diameters was determined by presoaking wheat straw samples overnight at 4 degc and transferring the equivalent of 0.2-0.3 g dry wheat straw as hydrated fibers into dialysis bags 6-8 kda cutoff 32 mm diameter visking r dialysis bag polylabo strasbourg france.

samples a and c were milled to 2 mm b and d to 100 mm and c and d were submitted to 5 ww naoh impregnation at high lc solids.

the highest carboxylate production rate was reached after dry chemo-mechanical treatment with naoh at 100 mm.

wheat straw at 2 mm 100 g was impregnated during 5 h at ambient conditions 25 degc with this alkaline solution using a pulverizing system 5 g of naoh per 100 g of wheat straw according to the procedure described previously  .

the chemically treated wheat straw-2 mm was dried at 105 degc 12 h resulting in a final moisture content of 8-10 ww and designated biomass b.mechanical treatmentbiomass a and b were comminuted using an impact mill oper- ating at ambient temperature and 18000 rpm hosokawa-alpine type upz augsburg germany.

fine particulate fractions were col- lected using a 100 mm mesh the material was milled until it passed through the grid and designated as biomass c and d respectively.substrate characterizationsubstrate compositionfor compositional analysis wheat straw 40 mg was submitted to the sulfuric acid hydrolysis method described by  analyzing monosaccharides glucose xylose and arabinose by high-performance liquid chromatography hplc using an ulti- mate 3000 dionex separation system equipped with a biorad ami- nex hpx 87h affinity column and a refractive index detector thermo scientific.

results g water g-1 dry sample represented the difference between the total pore volume esti- mated at 10 gl peg and the volume of 1 mm-diameter pores esti- mated at 100 gl peg which constitute the pore volume with diameter 1 mm likely to be accessible to bacteria.

dry wheat straw 1 ww was incubated for 72 h at 50 degc with 20 fpu.g-1 dw cellulase supplemented with 81 u.ml-1 b-glucosidase novozyme 188 in 50 mm sodium acet- ate buffer ph 5.0 containing 0.5 g.l-1 sodium azide.

however energy consumption associated with the production of d 100 mm was almost half that required to produce b which clearly demonstrates that prior chemical pretreatment was beneficial.

for instance when applying dcm soda pretreatment to wheat straw at a parti- cle size below 60 mm obtained an 11 increase in crystallinity.

the results obtained in the present study are consistent with the hypothesis that naoh pretreatment causes the cellulose to swell and decreases cellulose crystallinity as described by  suggesting that the severity of the applied treatment did not induce any rise in crystallinity.the comparison of the macroporosity of samples a to d brevealed a negative correlation between macroporosity with fine milling 100 mm in the absence of chemical pretreatment.
