Thus the changes in endophytic community occurring in the host plant may be affected by the parasite in an indirect manner.Alternatively the endophytic community composition is affected in direct manner by an exchange of endophytic bacteriabetween the P. aegyptiaca and its host.

The information gleaned in the present study regarding the endophytic microbial communities in this unique ecological system of two plants connected by their vascular system highlights the potential of exploiting alternative environmentally friendly approaches for parasitic weed control.Keywords broomrapes parasitic weed endophytic bacteria tomato Solanum lycopersicum biocontrolINTRODUCTIONPhelipanche aegyptiaca broomrapes is an obligate holoparasite that attacks the roots of almost all economically important crops in the Solanaceae Fabaceae Compositae Brassicaceae and Umbelliferae plant families    .

Tomato is hosting both endophytic fungi and endophytic bacteria some of them showing the ability to promote seed germination and protect tomato plants from pathogens         .

Furthermore since endophytic mycorrhizal fungi contain a large amount of bacteria in the ectomycorrhizal root tips   it might spread endophytic bacteria while colonizing the tomato.

In the current study we showed for the first time that bacterial endophytic communities changed with different stages of parasitism and that they also affect the host's endophytic composition.

By using molecular tools we were able to show that even though the dominant endophyte taxonomy in the parasite is similar to that in other known plant endophytes   the microbial ecology of these endophytic communities in P. aegyptiaca is greatly affected by its connection to the host.The greater similarity between the endophyte communities of the parasitic weed in the different post-attachment stages to each other than to those detected prior to attachment to the host pre- haustorium stage indicate that connection to the host is affecting the endophytic community composition of the parasite as well as the host.

This connection allows for the exchange of various substances and a possible exchange of endophytic microorganisms that inhabit the internal tissues of both plants.

To shed some light on bacterial interactions occurring between the parasitic Phelipanche aegyptiaca and its host tomato we characterized the endophytic composition in the parasite during the parasitization process and ascertained if these changes were accompanied by changes to endophytes in the host root.

Moreover the P. aegyptiaca endophytic community composition showed a clear shift from gram negative to gram-positive bacteria at different developmental stages of the parasite life cycle.

To examine possible functions of the endophytic bacteria in both the host and the parasite plants a number of unique bacterial candidates were isolated and characterized.
