More specifically this way of limiting the total population density to the carrying capacity c corresponds to assuming a well-mixed environment such that the relative population densities of the two strains remain unchanged upon spillover.Consequently two oscillating strains in one trap that use completely orthogonal quorum sensing systems only interact if the total population density hits the carrying capacity c. As shown in the main text the strains will eventually lock into an anti-phase pattern where they avoid reaching their peak density at the same time.

e-f Fluorescence green and population black over time for cells harboring the SLC with aq0.4 for the deterministicmodel e and LAA-tagged LuxI for a typical experimental run f as seen in c. g-hFluorescence green and population black over time for cells harboring the SLC with aq1.1 for the deterministic model g and TS-LAA-tagged LuxI for a typical experimental run h. i-j Fluorescence green and population black over time for cells harboring the SLC with aq2 for the deterministic model i and untagged LuxI for a typical experimental run j as seen in d. The video stills c-d as well as the fluorescence and population profiles in f h and j are all representative of typical microfluidic experiments with these strains.Scott et al.Page 18Fig.

Because of this growth advantage a 11 mixture of these strains in a batch culture with or without the lysis gene is primarily taken over by the faster growing Rpa-GFP strain by the time the strains reach stationary phase Fig.

However this phenomenon of stably co-culturing two metabolically competitive strains through orthogonal self-lysing offers the possibility of many unique applications beyond drug delivery where the use of synthetic microbial ecosystems is advantageous.Methods SummaryPlasmids and StrainsOur circuit strains without the lysis plasmid were cultured in LB media with 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin in a 37degC incubator.

Plots were generated by using MATLAB.For co-culture experiments Co-culture was determined to be lost if the fluorescence of either CFP or GFP went below background fluorescence and then images were checked manually in cases of the oscillatory lysing CFP strain which can go below threshold between lysis events.Plate Reader Fluorescence and Population EstimatesFor the well-plate experiments the strains were grown in a standard Falcon tissue culture 96- well flat bottom plate with appropriate antibiotics kanamycin only for non-lysis and kanamycin and chloramphenicol for lysis strains.

For all parameter scans of two strains the model equations were simulated for 500 time units and the last 100 time units were analyzed to determine the average cell densitiesandof the two strains.

Cyan dashed lines indicate the region where both strains are in the oscillatory regime black dashed lines mark the area in which strains are self- limiting.

Here we combine orthogonal quorum sensing systems and a population control circuit with diverse self-limiting growth dynamics in order to engineer two 'ortholysis' circuits capable of maintaining a stable co-culture of metabolically competitive strains in microfluidic devices.

1e-g. We used these components to design synchronized lysis circuits SLCs16 in two bacterial strains whereby each strain is programmed to lyse upon reaching a critical population density.To understand how an ecosystem harboring the synchronized lysis circuit SLC can be altered we established the range of possible self-limiting dynamics of the circuit Fig.

With two non-lysing strains the faster growing strain will eventually dominate the population Fig.
