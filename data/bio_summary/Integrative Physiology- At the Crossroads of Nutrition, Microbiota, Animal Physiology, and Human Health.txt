Thus HMA piglets have the potential to be a robust model not only for investigating how the gut microbiota composition changes in response to environmental factors such as age diet antibiotic use and infection but also for elucidating the interactions among host diet and gut bacteria in human health and disease .The Multiorganismal HumanHuman physiology can be seen as the integration between func- tions encoded in the human genome and microbiome particu- larly the gut microbiome .

Mice and humans both harbor complex gut microbiota with similar community structure at the phyla level   most metabolites produced by the mouse gut microbiota are also found in humans .

However we may not rule out that dietary fats influence the gut microbiota via indirect mechanisms such as by changing the bile acid flux and release into the intestinal lumen and thereby affecting the gut microbiota composition  .

The gut bacteria rely on non-digestible or un-digested nutrients from the diet together with mucin and sloughed cells locally produced in the gut to maintain their pop- ulation levels .

Metabol- ically active gut bacteria can impact host physiology andphysiopathology by delivering various bioactive compounds into the systemic circulation  .To understand and dissect the contribution of gut microbiota to human health a top-down systems approach may be em- ployed  .

Nutritional factors which may drive population changes of key functional gut bacteria and thus modulate molecular crosstalk between host and gut mi- crobiota can be evaluated and identified via such a strategy.

was reduced from more than 30 of the total gut bacterial population to almost non-detectable soon after the human host followed a dietary intervention aiming to change the gut micro- biota.

One strain Entero- bacter cloacae B29 was isolated from his gut and found to induce obesity when mono-associated with germ-free mice indicating that this strain may contribute causatively to the extreme obesity phenotype of the host  .In a clinical trial on nutritional intervention of genetically obese children with Prader-Willi syndrome high complex carbohy- drates in the diet induced significant changes of the gut micro- biota with concomitant weight loss and alleviation of metabolic deteriorations .

Genetic manipulation of the strains for knocking out their choline-TMA conversion genes can also be used to confirm their causative role in development in host's atherosclerosis.Thus despite the sheer complexity of the integrated physi- ology between human host and the gut microbiota we propose that the combined use of strain-level metagenomic analysis and metabolite-specific metabolomic profiling will pinpoint specific genomes representing gut bacterial strains which may mecha- nistically contribute to a particular disease phenotype in the host.

This top-down systems strategy can significantly facili- tate our understanding of how nutritional modulation of the gut microbiota can contribute to the health recovery and mainte- nance of human hosts.From Model Organisms to an Integrative Framework for Human HealthThe relationship among diet animal physiology and gut micro- biota is fundamental to health and the organic processes of host physiology behavior and microbiota are entwined to such an extent that they can effectively be considered parts of the same homeostatic system.
