The propor- tion of gram-positive bacteria significantly increased in infants after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam in this study which is consistent with the potent activity of this antibiotic against gram-negative bacilli.In addition to the composition of gut microbiota the metabolites of gut microbiota were also affected by antibiotic treatment in this study and this effect was dependent on the duration and type of the antibiotics used.

Moxalactam is an oxa-b-lactam antibiotic that inactivates b-lactamase and also is a broad spectrum antibiotic that works against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaer- obic and aerobic bacteria especially Gram-negative bacillus such as Enterobacteriaceae.In our study the combination of the classical b-lactam antibiotic penicillin and the new synthetic b-lactam antibiotic moxalactam penicillin-moxalactam and the combination of the extended-spectrum penicillin-derivative piperacillin and the b-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam piperacillin-tazobactam.

First both antibiotic treatment groups in this study were not sampled after day 7 and therefore the long-term effects of antibiotic treatments on gut microbiota could not be determined.

The microbiota remained stable within the first three days following antibiotic treatment but changed significantly after one-week treatment most notably with an increase in the composition of some pathogenic bacteria.

although the antibiotic treated preterm infants have no such clinical manifestations the activity of propanoate metabolism was much lower in PT and PM groups thanthat in the antibiotic-free group on d7 indicating that the physiological metabolism is abnormal after antibiotic treatment in preterm infants.We also observed that the penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis pathways were significantly different among the three groups on both d3 and d7 after birth.

In our study the activity of the penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis pathways was higher in the AF group than that in the antibiotic treatment groups suggesting that the function of the peni- cillin and cephalosporin producer species decreased in the antibiotic treatment groups.

The subjects of the two antibiotic treatment groups were quite distant from each other based on the first two principal component scores which accounted for 75 and 5 of the total variations respectively Fig.

The PM group had the highest abundance of L-tyrosine and citric acid among the three groups where citric acid was positively correlated with the abundant bacteria in the antibiotic treatment groups and was negatively correlated with the dominant bacteria in the AF group.

We hypothesized that the prolonged antibiotic therapy would affect the early development of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites.
