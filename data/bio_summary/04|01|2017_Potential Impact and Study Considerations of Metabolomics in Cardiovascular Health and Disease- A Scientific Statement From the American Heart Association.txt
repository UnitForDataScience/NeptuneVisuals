these chal- lenges include those pertaining to alignment of data toallow comparison of specific metabolites across hundreds to thousands of samples handling and extraction of large spectral data files and ultimately the definitive identifica- tion of metabolites of interest discussed below in current applications.metabolomics discoveries in cvd although still early in its technical and scientific evolution metabolomics and its application to the study of clinical cvd have already demonstrated substantial potential for discovery and insight.metabolite correlates of cvdan overview of clinical studies of metabolomics in cvd is provided in table 1. early metabolomics studies made use of nmr-based approaches to distinguish individuals with multivessel coronary artery disease cad from individuals without angiographic cad using spectral fingerprint pat- terns.3 although initially promising with reportedly 90 predictive power for identifying patients with cad from control subjects spectral fingerprint data were in hindsight more reflective of sex and statin medication use than inde- pendent correlates of cad.4 these results underscore the need for comprehensive follow-up to identify signatures of a potential cause rather than a consequence of disease careful chemistry to annotate metabolite peaks and statisti- cal evaluation of potential confounders that can influence dynamic metabolomic signals.

thus the need for data tools is of particular importance in deal- ing with untargeted metabolomics in which both the volume and complexity of data can scale by multiple orders of magni- tude especially when applied to large population-level studies.data processingcentral to metabolomics is the actual collection and handling of either ms or nmr data.

as the field of metabolomics continues to advance so too will data processing approaches as part of ongoing col- lective efforts to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of findings across laboratories.data analysessimilar to issues in data processing there currently exists little uniformity in the biostatistical management and analysis ofmetabolomics data.

in addition publication requirements should ensure the deposit of all metabolomics data includ- ing raw and processed data in a central publicly accessible repository as is currently required for other omics data.

additionally a centralized storage of metabolomics data provides opportuni- ties for secondary analysis and data mining ensuring the con- tinued value of generated data sets.

some of the potential requirements for transitioning metabolomics from a research to a clinical prac- tice application are shown in the appendix.a key issue concerning the possible future translation of metabolomics from research to clinical practice is the fact that most laboratory data used for patient care involve quan- tification of results expressed as concentration units absolu- tion quantification most metabolomics data are currently expressed as a percent increasedecrease relative to a refer- ence population relative quantification.

an example of this kind of structure is the clinical proteomic tumor analysis consortium of the national cancer institute for developing proteomics platforms.46study design and technical considerationsthe challenges pertaining to translation notwithstanding several key study design and technical considerations are also required for successful implementation of metabolomics approaches in research table 3. the type of study subjects size of the study cohort and availability of appropriate control subjects are all important factors for evaluating the extent to which there is adequate statistical power for detecting asso- ciations between metabolites and a given outcome of inter- est data analyses and data reporting below.

statistical challenges for handling and analyzing metabolomics data are similar to those for other large-scale profiling data but also include several unique fea- tures.

the next generation of discoveries in metabolo- mics will rely heavily on progress made to establish robust statistical methods for analyzing these high-dimensional data and improvements in the annotation of metabolite-related bio- chemical pathways to enable in silico pathway analyses.data reportingwith respect to reporting metabolomics data and results standardization is also greatly needed.

such throughput applied to large-scale studies will allow characterization of chemical diversity across multiple racialethnic populations in relation to prospective disease phenotypes and in conjunction with integrated data on genomic variation epigenetic markers mrna transcription and other biomarkers to enable a true systems-level analysis of human physiology and disease.biochemical identity and role of novel metabolites early chemoinformatics approaches have been developed to aid in metabolite identification and data visualization although existing tools remain relatively rudimentary.

current challenges facing the field of metabolomics include scaling throughput and technical capacity for metabolomics approaches bioinformatic and chemoinformatic tools for handling large-scale metabolomics data methods for elucidating the biochemical structure and function of novel metabolites and strategies for determining the true clinical relevance of metabolites observed in association with cardiovascular disease outcomes.

accordingly the rich small-molecule metabolite data represented by an individual's metabolome along with the chemical diversity of population-scale metabolomes could lead to key pathobio- logical insights and offer powerful tools for personalizing risk assessment and disease prevention.

as the number of human investigations with metabolomics profiling data available has expanded studies have begun to associate circulating metabolites not only with global cvd outcomes79 but also with specific cvd subtypes including myocardial ischemia and infarction5 congestive heart failure612 and stroke.15metabolite correlates of cardiometabolic risk factorsoverall cvd represents a complex collection of multifacto- rial disease states and risk factors.

furthermore bcaas appear lower in metabolically healthy versus metabolically unwell overweightobese individuals34 and can predict improve- ment in insulin resistance with weight loss.35 studies in rats suggest that dietary supplementation of high-fat diets with bcaas can promote insulin resistance regardless of weight gain.29 in humans changes in circulating bcaa levels have been independently associated with cvd adding further to the growing body of data pointing to common metabolic dis- turbances giving rise to both diabetes mellitus and cvd.713 although the mechanistic underpinnings of these findings to date remain unclear recent work has raised the intrigu- ing possibility that elevated bcaas may originate from gut microbiota rather than from endogenous sources.

a review of the us food and drug administration's perspective on clinical ms provides several examples of pathways leading to approved diagnostic tests.45 in the research setting metabolomics data have been used primarily to classify different populations with respect to presence or absence of disease or with respect to risk for disease.
