These chal- lenges include those pertaining to alignment of data toallow comparison of specific metabolites across hundreds to thousands of samples handling and extraction of large spectral data files and ultimately the definitive identifica- tion of metabolites of interest discussed below in Current Applications.Metabolomics Discoveries in CVD Although still early in its technical and scientific evolution metabolomics and its application to the study of clinical CVD have already demonstrated substantial potential for discovery and insight.Metabolite Correlates of CVDAn overview of clinical studies of metabolomics in CVD is provided in Table 1.

Metabolite profil- ing and cardiovascular event risk a prospective study of 3 popula- tion-based cohorts.

Thus the need for data tools is of particular importance in deal- ing with untargeted metabolomics in which both the volume and complexity of data can scale by multiple orders of magni- tude especially when applied to large population-level studies.Data ProcessingCentral to metabolomics is the actual collection and handling of either MS or NMR data.

As the field of metabolomics continues to advance so too will data processing approaches as part of ongoing col- lective efforts to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of findings across laboratories.Data AnalysesSimilar to issues in data processing there currently exists little uniformity in the biostatistical management and analysis ofmetabolomics data.

In addition publication requirements should ensure the deposit of all metabolomics data includ- ing raw and processed data in a central publicly accessible repository as is currently required for other omics data.

Additionally a centralized storage of metabolomics data provides opportuni- ties for secondary analysis and data mining ensuring the con- tinued value of generated data sets.

Current challenges facing the field of metabolomics include scaling throughput and technical capacity for metabolomics approaches bioinformatic and chemoinformatic tools for handling large-scale metabolomics data methods for elucidating the biochemical structure and function of novel metabolites and strategies for determining the true clinical relevance of metabolites observed in association with cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Nonetheless the extent to which metabolomics work will yield a next generation of important discoveries in cardiovascular science will depend on the success with which the field can address key challenges including bioinformatics approaches for handling high-throughput untargeted metabo- lomics data strategies for identifying the biochemical struc- ture and functional role of novel metabolites and methods for determining the true relevance of metabolites observed in association with clinical outcomes.

A later study used a targeted tandem MS MSMS approach to identify and quantify 69 metabolites in individuals with angiographic CAD reveal- ing higher levels of branched-chain amino acids BCAAs in association with CAD even after adjustment for car- diovascular risk factors.713 Subsequently high-throughput NMR measures of 68 abundant plasma metabolites per- formed in a multicohort epidemiological study including the National Finnish FINRISK study Southall and Brent Revisited Study and British Women's Health and Heart Study showed that higher phenylalanine and monoun- saturated fatty acid levels were associated with increased CVD risk whereas higher concentrations of omega-6 fatty acids and docosahexaenoic acid were associated with lower risk of CVD over a follow-up period spanning decades.
