These chal- lenges include those pertaining to alignment of data toallow comparison of specific metabolites across hundreds to thousands of samples handling and extraction of large spectral data files and ultimately the definitive identifica- tion of metabolites of interest discussed below in Current Applications.Metabolomics Discoveries in CVD Although still early in its technical and scientific evolution metabolomics and its application to the study of clinical CVD have already demonstrated substantial potential for discovery and insight.Metabolite Correlates of CVDAn overview of clinical studies of metabolomics in CVD is provided in Table 1.

Thus the need for data tools is of particular importance in deal- ing with untargeted metabolomics in which both the volume and complexity of data can scale by multiple orders of magni- tude especially when applied to large population-level studies.Data ProcessingCentral to metabolomics is the actual collection and handling of either MS or NMR data.

As the field of metabolomics continues to advance so too will data processing approaches as part of ongoing col- lective efforts to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of findings across laboratories.Data AnalysesSimilar to issues in data processing there currently exists little uniformity in the biostatistical management and analysis ofmetabolomics data.

In addition publication requirements should ensure the deposit of all metabolomics data includ- ing raw and processed data in a central publicly accessible repository as is currently required for other omics data.

Additionally a centralized storage of metabolomics data provides opportuni- ties for secondary analysis and data mining ensuring the con- tinued value of generated data sets.

Current challenges facing the field of metabolomics include scaling throughput and technical capacity for metabolomics approaches bioinformatic and chemoinformatic tools for handling large-scale metabolomics data methods for elucidating the biochemical structure and function of novel metabolites and strategies for determining the true clinical relevance of metabolites observed in association with cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Nonetheless the extent to which metabolomics work will yield a next generation of important discoveries in cardiovascular science will depend on the success with which the field can address key challenges including bioinformatics approaches for handling high-throughput untargeted metabo- lomics data strategies for identifying the biochemical struc- ture and functional role of novel metabolites and methods for determining the true relevance of metabolites observed in association with clinical outcomes.

Some of the potential requirements for transitioning metabolomics from a research to a clinical prac- tice application are shown in the Appendix.A key issue concerning the possible future translation of metabolomics from research to clinical practice is the fact that most laboratory data used for patient care involve quan- tification of results expressed as concentration units absolu- tion quantification most metabolomics data are currently expressed as a percent increasedecrease relative to a refer- ence population relative quantification.

Statistical challenges for handling and analyzing metabolomics data are similar to those for other large-scale profiling data but also include several unique fea- tures.

The next generation of discoveries in metabolo- mics will rely heavily on progress made to establish robust statistical methods for analyzing these high-dimensional data and improvements in the annotation of metabolite-related bio- chemical pathways to enable in silico pathway analyses.Data ReportingWith respect to reporting metabolomics data and results standardization is also greatly needed.
