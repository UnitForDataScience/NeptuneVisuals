Interestingly the abundance of two genera in the phylum Firmicutes namely Dorea and rc4-4 was signifi- cantly lower in MB and TB groups than in the HFC group  P  0 01  P  0 001.The abundance of TM7 the unclassified genus in the family F16 Bacteroides the unclassified genus in the family S24-7 Mucispirillum and rc4-4 was similar in the HFC and LF groups while Dorea was lower in the LF group than in the HFC group P  005.Multivariate data analysisA multivariate data analysis was conducted to elucidate how different groups were related to each other concerning the abundance of the microbiota and cholesterol levels  .

Further animals in the two groups MB and TB were clearly separated from the HFC group as well as from the LF group whereas the 0 1 MB group was scattered on the same side as the HFC group.

Furthermore the caecal SCFA was higher and liver succinic acid lower with this group than with the HFC group which is consistent with other studies.In conclusion the results from the present study suggest that supplementation of 5 gkg of MB and TB into a HFC diet is effective in decreasing liver cholesterol concentration in rats after 3 weeks.

Within the phylum Deferribacteres an increased abundance of Mucispirillum was noted in the MB group  P  0 038 compared with the HFC group and P  0 018 compared with the LF group.

Notably the caecal abundance of Mucispirillum was markedly increased in the MB group compared with the HFC group.

After ANOVA Dunnett's method was applied to specifically identify which groups including the group fed the LF diet were significantly different from the HFC group to evaluate whether the butyr- ins could counteract the adverse effects induced by high fat feeding.
