Interestingly the abundance of two genera in the phylum Firmicutes namely Dorea and rc4-4 was signifi- cantly lower in MB and TB groups than in the HFC group  P  0 01  P  0 001.The abundance of TM7 the unclassified genus in the family F16 Bacteroides the unclassified genus in the family S24-7 Mucispirillum and rc4-4 was similar in the HFC and LF groups while Dorea was lower in the LF group than in the HFC group P  005.Multivariate data analysisA multivariate data analysis was conducted to elucidate how different groups were related to each other concerning the abundance of the microbiota and cholesterol levels  .

Incorporation of MB and TB to a HFC diet resulted in an improvement of the liver lipid profile as evaluated by a significant decrease in hepatic total cholesterol concentrations  P  0 0001 for MB and P  0 0022 for TB respectively LDL-cholesterol  P  0 0001 P  0 0005 respectively and LDLHDL ratio  P  0 0006 P  0 0002 respectively.

Mean value was significantly different from that of the LF group  P  005  P  001  P  0001  P  00001 one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test.mmol P  0 05.

Mean value was significantly different from that of the HFC group  P  005  P  001  P  0001  P  00001 one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test.due to lower available amounts of cholesterol.

Within the phylum Deferribacteres an increased abundance of Mucispirillum was noted in the MB group  P  0 038 compared with the HFC group and P  0 018 compared with the LF group.

Further animals in the two groups MB and TB were clearly separated from the HFC group as well as from the LF group whereas the 0 1 MB group was scattered on the same side as the HFC group.

However the TB group tended to have higher concentrations of total SCFA P  0 093 acetic acid P  0 074 and propionic acid P  0 092 compared with the MB group .
