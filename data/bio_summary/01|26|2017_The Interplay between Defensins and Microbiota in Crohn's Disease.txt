in this review the role defensins play in cd and the strategies aimed at overcoming bacterial resistance will be discussed.introductioncrohn's disease cd is one of the principal types of inflam- matory bowel disease ibd that can affect the intestinal mucosa.

ileal cd is restricted to the ileum and accounts for 30 of cases while colonic cd accounts for the remaining 20 of cases and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis uc the lowest incidence rates for cd are found in asia and developing countries with higher rates in the western world.for example the incidence of cd in europe and north america is approximately 3 per 100000 people.

moreover among the firmicutes a decrease in the number of faecalibacterium prausnitzii f. prausnitzii was observed 20. in mouse models of intestinal inflammation oral administration of f. prausnitzii reduced inflammatory effects and helped to restore the normal microbiota compo- sition 20. therefore the decreased abundance of b. fragilisand f. prausnitzii could contribute to the intestinal inflamma- tory status in patients with cd ii there is an increased level of the proteobacteria and actinobacteria phyla including the family of enterobacteriaceae in patients with cd.

depending on the specific region affected cd is classified as ileal cd or colonic cd.

reduced expression of defensins was also found in patients with cd ileal cd is characterized-defensins while certain -defensins are implicated in colonic cd.

have confirmed this by showing that hbd2 is more abundant in patients with cd and uc 75. moreover there was increased expression of hbd2 in inflamed tissues compared to noninflamed sites from the-defensins hbd3 and hbd4 were found to be only minimally expressed in control patients and no significant changes in patients with cd were observed 77. to explain the impaired expression of some -defensins that occurs in colonic cd a decrease in - defensins copy number on chromosome 8 was hypothesized.

found significant differences between con- trol groups and patients with cd controls had a median of four copies while colonic patients with cd had a median of three .in the intestine hbd1 is partially under the control of the an essential mediator of intestinal homeosta- sis  abnormal ppar- production results in reduced antimicrobial activity of the mucosa.

indeed a reduced immune tolerance to components of the intestinal commensal microbiota and inflammation of the intestinal barrier typifies patients with cd.

recent studies have also identified a genetic association between cd susceptibility and autophagy genes including atg16l1 autophagy-related 16-like 1 and irgm immune-related gtpase m genetic immunologi- cal and microbial studies have shown that the etiology of ibd involves a reduced tolerance to components of the intestinal commensal microbiota because of the large number of enteric bacteria in contact with the intestinal mucosal surface and the potential threat of opportunistic invasions a perfecthomeostasis is central for the maintenance of the intestinal- microbial interface.

therefore the microbiota may have closer contact with the mucosa during cd 23.role of the intestinal membrane and innate immune responsethe intestinal barrier plays an important role in the functions of the immune system and although it allows the absorption of ions water and other nutrients it behaves as a barrier to prevent the infiltration of bacteria through the mucosal surface.

although these nod2 mutations play a role in the etiology of cd several studies have demonstrated that they alone are not sufficient for the development of the disease.restoring normal expression of amps may rebalance the intestinal microbiota and ameliorate intestinal inflammation.

more than 80 of these cells are enterocytes while the remaining are enteroendocrine goblet or paneth cells 24. in many studies it has been shown that there is a relationship between variation in intestinal permeability and the status of cd disease.

research into the mechanisms underlying this disease has found that cd likely develops due to impaired antimicrobial activity of the intestinal mucosa against components of the microbiota.

the aim of this review is to discuss recent developments on the general hypothesis that crohn's disease is caused by a defect in the defensin-mediated antibacterial mucosal barrier.microbiota in the intestinal mucosa and dysregulation in cdthe human intestinal microbiota is dominated by four bacte- rial populations about 90 belong to the phyla of firmicutes and bacteroidetes while the remainder is comprised of the phyla of proteobacteria such as escherichia and helicobac- ter actinobacteria and numerous viruses protists and fungi  .
