The results showed a significant P  0.01 decrease in the level of expression of the hSMVT protein at the cell membrane  with no change in its level in the total cell homogenate .To further investigate the potential involvement of CK2 in the inhibitory effect of LPS on biotin uptake by colonic epithelial NCM460 cells and on cell surface expression of the hSMVT protein we investigated the effect of mutating to alanine the putative CK2 phosphorylation sites in the hSMVT protein Thr78AlaSer128Ala Ser242Ala Thr366Ala and Thr627Ala on carrier-mediated biotin uptake and on membrane expression of SMVT.

This inhibition was not mediated via changes in the level of expression of total cellular SMVT protein or in the level of its mRNA rather it appeared to be mediated via a decrease in the fraction of the hSMVT protein that is expressed at the surface of colonic epithelial cells as indicated by the results of biotinylation assay.It has been reported that both the CK2 and the PKC-mediated pathways play a role in regulating membrane expression of different proteins in a variety of cell types.

This inhibition was again found to be associated with a decrease in the level of expression of the hSMVT protein at the cell surface with no change in total cellular level for the hSMVT protein.In summary results of these investigations show that colonic biotin uptake is sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the bacterial endotoxin LPS and that such an effect is mediated via a decrease in cell surface expression of the hSMVT protein.

2.Effect of LPS on the level of expression of total cellular sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter SMVT protein and mRNA in human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells A and mouse native colonic tissue B. NCM460 cells were pretreated with LPS 50 mgml 72 h followed by determination of the level of expression of hSMVT protein A i and mRNA A ii.

The effect of LPS CK2 inhibitors and mutating the putative CK2 phosphorylation sites in the SMVT protein on expression of the carrier protein at the cell membrane of NCM460 and ARPE-19 cells was examined by means of biotinylation assay using a cell surface biotinylation kit Pierce Biotechnology Rockford IL as previously described 6 21 33 39.

These findings suggest that LPS interferes with the level of expression of SMVT at the cell surface of the colonic epithelial cells.Role for CK2 in Mediating the LPS Effect on Colonic Biotin Uptake and on Membrane of Expression of the hSMVT ProteinRecent studies have reported a role for CK2 11 13 and protein kinase C PKC 23 40 in the process of cell surface expression of membrane transporters in a variety of cellular systems.

The results showed a significant P  0.05 reduction in the level of expression of the Thr78Ala mutant at the cell surface compared with level of expression of the wild-typehSMVT protein .DISCUSSIONEmerging evidence has pointed to the involvement of biotin in critical metabolic activities andGo tophysiological functions beyond its classical role as a cofactor for enzymes like carboxylases.

Also inhibiting CK2 with the use of specific pharmacological inhibitors led to significant inhibition in both biotin uptake and in the level of expression of the hSMVT protein at the cell membrane without affecting the level of expression of the transporter in total cell homogenate.

These findings suggest a role for CK2 in mediating the inhibitory effect of LPS on biotin uptake and on membrane expression of the hSMVT protein.To further confirm the possible role of CK2 in regulating biotin uptake and in expression of the hSMVT protein at the cell surface we examined the effect of mutating individually the putative CK2 phosphorylation sites in the SMVT polypeptide on biotin uptake.

The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min and the protein content was measured using DC protein assay kit Bio-Rad.
