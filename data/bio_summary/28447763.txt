Following treatment with berberine for 6 weeks LPS plasma levels in HFD-fed rats were significantly reduced when compared with the untreated HFD-fed rats however LPS levels in berberine-treated rats remained higher than in control rats.

The present findings indicated that berberine through modulating gut microbiota restored the gut barrier reduced metabolic endotoxemia and systemic inflammation and improved gut peptide levels in high-fat diet-fed rats.

LPS levels in portal plasma were significantly higher in HFD-fed rats compared with control rats Fig.

In accordance with the changes in plasma LPS levels a marked increase in plasmaFITC-dextran area under the curve was observed in HFD-fed rats compared with in the control rats Fig.

Claudin-1 claudin-2 ZO-1 and occludin mRNA expression levels in the proximal colon segments from HFD-fed rats were significantly decreased as compared with rats in the control group.

In addition berberine-treated rats exhibited a 3-fold increase in proglucagon mRNA expres- sion levels and in the number of GLP-1-positive L-cells inthe proximal colon compared with HFD-fed untreated rats Fig.

These results suggested that berberine can shift the composition of the gut microbiome of HFD-fed rats towards that of control rats.

Berberine supplementation significantly decreased plasma ALT levels however it did not affect aspartate aminotransferase levels when compared with untreated HFD-fed rats Fig.

In addition Spearman's correlation analysis revealed plasma GIP levels to be negatively correlated with the abundance of the Robinsoniella genus.The present study suggested that the wide shift in the gut microbiota composition induced by berberine may attenuate insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders in HFD-fed rats via several pathways.

Further work is required to explore the putative relationship between the abundance of Akkermansia bacteria and the integrity of the gut barrier.The modulation of gut hormone levels by berberine has been reported to serve an important role in improving energy homeostasis.
