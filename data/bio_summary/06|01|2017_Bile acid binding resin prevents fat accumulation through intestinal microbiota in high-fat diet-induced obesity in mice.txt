Male Balbc mice were fed a low-fat diet LFD high-fat diet HFD or HFD with BAR HFD  BAR and then metabolic parameters caecal microbiota and metabolites were investigated.

Colonized germ-free mice showed a reduction in adiposity by BAR administration.Energy expenditure was lower in HFD-fed mice and higher in HFD  BAR-fed mice but the increments induced by administration of BAR were not observed in antibiotic-treated mice.Conclusions.

We found that BAR prevented obesity and increased energy expenditure in HFD-induced obesity in mice although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated.Therefore weinvestigated the effect of BAR onintestinal microbiota and the role of microbiota in the prevention of obesity by BAR.Materials and MethodsAnimalsFour to 6-week-old male Balbc mice and germ-free Balbc mice were obtained from Sankyo Labo Service Tokyo Japan.Experimental DesignThe mice were fed a low-fat diet LFD CE2 10 fat CLEA Japan Japan HFD D12492 60 fat Research Diet USA.

For statistical analysis IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 IBM Japan Japan was used.ResultsBAR Altered Intestinal Microbiota and Increased Propionate Production in the IntestinesBalbc mice were fed an LFD HFD or HFD with BAR HFD  BAR for 4-6 weeks and then their caecal weights and microbiota were analyzed.

The composition of the microbiota differed significantly between LFD HFD and HFD  BAR groups LFD vs. HFD dissimilarity index P  0.001 HFD vs. HFD  BAR dissimilarity index P  0.01.The quantitative PCR showed that the frequency of Clostridium leptum subgroup was higher in both HFD-fed and HFD  BAR-fed mice than in LFD-fed mice and the frequency of Bacteroides group was lower in HFD-fed mice than in LFD-fed mice.

Although the mechanism is yet to beDiscussionWe demonstrated that administration of BAR altered intesti- nal microbiota and fermentation and prevented fat accumu- lation through intestinal microbiota.The alteration of microbiota by an HFD in this study waselucidated altering intestinal microbiota by BAR could be a novel therapeutic approach for obesity and dysbiosis and needs to be investigated in humans.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at consistent with previous reports showing that an HFD increased Clostridium leptum that belongs to the Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroides .

Because we reported the reduction of intestinal bile acid pool by BAR  the effect of BAR on microbiota could be explained by the reduction of bile acids in the intestine.

However BAR does not absorb bile acid specifi- cally and other molecules absorbed by BAR might be involved in the action .
