The possible innovative use of Bifidobacterium longum W11 in association with rifaximin a new horizon for combined approach J Clin Gastroenterol 50Suppl 2S153-S156 Proceedings from the 8th Probiotics Prebiotics  New Foods for Micro- biota and Human Health meeting held in Rome Italy 13 to 15 September 2016.

The analysis of the sequence may provide insights into the microbiological characteris- tics and the functional activity of this probiotic strain.embers of the genus Bifidobacterium are nonmotile non-spore-forming Gram- positive polymorphic anaerobic rods with a high GC DNA content.

The average of GC content of the genome is 59.9.The complete genome sequence of B. longum W11 may be useful to better understand the health-promoting characteristics of this probiotic strain and to clarify the mechanisms involved in its interaction with the host.Accession numbers.

longum W11 LMG P-21586 has been isolated from the intestinal microbiota of a healthy man and has been studied for some microbialcharacteristics .Genomic DNA of B. longum W11 was subject to whole-genome sequencing using MiSeq Illumina United Kingdom at GenProbio s.r.l.

The MIRA program version 4.0 was used for the de novo assembly while proteins encoded by open reading frames ORFs were predicted using Prodigal.

The circular chromosome contains 2329981 bp with 1884 ORFs with these total numbers being higher than those in the representativelongum NCC2705.

The version de- scribed in this paper is version MRBG01000000.ACKNOWLEDGMENTNo support was received in order to perform this research.REFERENCESBiavati B Mattarelli P. 2006.
