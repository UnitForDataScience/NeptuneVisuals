The number of OTUs shared among BALF sputum and OWF was 571 the number shared between BALF and sputum was 109 while the number of OTUs shared between sputum and OWF was just 21 Figure 1f.discussionChanges of bacterial microbiome are associated with pathogenesis of infectious and noninfectious diseases.

To investigate the compositionand diversity of the microbiome of airway we analyzed and compared the microbiota of BALF sputum and OWF using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing technique.Our data showed that the community richness and diversity of BALF were higher than those in OWF or in sputum.

In the last 10 years 16S rRNA gene sequencing technique has been thought to be more comprehensive and reliable than those of culture-dependent methods for monitoring bacterial microbiome in skin organs and tracts quantitatively and qualitatively.3 In this case choosing credible samples are critical to evaluate the community composition of microbiome in the host tracts including respiratory tract.

Such limitations may cause that the many studies of microbiota based on BALF and sputum overestimate bacterial composition and load in lower respiratory tract.In summary our data provide direct evidence to evaluate sampling methods for investigating bacterial microbiome in airways while induced sputum samples represent those in the lower airway in a great extent.

Individuals with a history of smoking upper respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks and antibiotics used within 3 months were excluded from the study.Three types of samples oral wash fluid OWF induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF were obtained from participants according to standardized procedures.3 The isolation amplification and sequencing of bacterial DNA from each sample were performed by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd. Shanghai China.

The most two abundant bacterial phyla in terms of both sequences and OTUs were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in BALF sputum and OWF the proportion of which accounted for all sequences in samples was 77.69 65.86 and 63.96 respectively.

The credible samples are critical to evaluate the community composition of microbiome.

This suggested that microbiota in the lower airways might derive from the upper respiratory tract.It should be noted that although the next generation sequencing provides a great chance to investigate the microbiome of airways some attentions still need to be considered such as differentiation between dead and alive bacteria and interpretation of data.5 In addition when sampling BALF or sputum contamination from the upper respiratory tract and lacking of homogeneity of the bacterial community crossing the airway are also inevitable in most instances even if the strict operational instructions are followed.
