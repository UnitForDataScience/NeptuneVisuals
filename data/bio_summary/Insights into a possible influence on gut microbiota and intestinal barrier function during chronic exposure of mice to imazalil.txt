The presented values are the means 6 SEM n 14 6. p  .05 versus control.changes of the whole gut microbiota and the possible effects af- ter analyzing by PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and more precise analysis the species level of gut microbiota requires advances in sequencing.Usually undigested dietary fibers as well as proteins and peptides that escape digestion by host enzymes in the upper gut can be fermented in the cecum and colon by gut microbiota.

The intestinal barrier consists of a mechanical barrier a chemical barrier a biological barrier and an immunebarrier and each barrier plays a substantial defense role in the mucous membrane of the enteron   .The intestinal barrier assumes an important role in a stable microecosystem 1 The surface of the gut lumen has a thick mucus layer in contact with a large number of microorganisms and the secreted mucin can protect the intestinal mucosa and resist penetration by bacteria  2 The dy- namic stability of the microecosystem can maintain intestinal barrier function and prevent abnormal immune responses by the mucosa  3 Tight junctions in the intestinal tract seal the gaps between adjacent IECs and keeps substances such as antigens and microbes contained in the lumen   4 Immunoglobulin A pattern recognition receptor and antimicrobial peptide AMP can limit the population of gutVC The Author 2017.

The possible effects of antibiotics endocrine disrup- tors and pesticide residues on animal or gut microbiota and the subsequent damage deserve more attention  .In a previous study we observed that oral administration of high doses 25 50 100 mgkg of IMZ to male ICR mice for 28 days resulted in gut microbiota dysbiosis and colonic inflam- mation .

Our data suggested that gut microbiota and intestinal barrier were potential toxicological targets of IMZ.Key words imazalil gut microbiota intestinal barrier mice.A large number of studies have shown that the intestinal tract plays an extremely important role in the occurrence and devel- opment of disease  .

In order to re- search how quickly IMZ affects the gut microbiota and how se- vere will the subsequent damage be after gut microbiota dysbiosis at different times of IMZ-exposure.

The binding scores obtained for IMZ with CFTR and the SLC26 family were -4.9 and -6.0 kcalmol respectively.The Gut Microbiota Composition and Ionic Transport Function Could be Recovered After IMZ ExposureTo determine whether IMZ-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis can reverse by itself the mice treated with 2.5 mgkg IMZ for 15 weeks were then allowed to recover for 45 days.

The study observed that IMZ altered the composition of the gut microbiota mucus secretion and ion translocation after 15-week chronic exposure.

The gut microbiota shapes intestinal immune responses during health and dis- ease.
