The results showed that the microbial richness and diversity in piglets' feces PF significantly increased from birth to weaning 21 d. The composition and function of microbiota in the feces of piglets after birth tended to be similar to those from the slatted floor FL sow's milk SM and nipple surface SN and lacter the fecal microbial communities of piglets later during lactation were more similar to their mother's.

B Principal coordinate analysis PCA of microbial functional diversity across all digesta samples using the relative abundances of functional pathways.breastfeeding may enrich vaginally acquired lactic acid-producing bacteria in the baby's intestine and human milk and limit the growth of several strains of E. coli which may explain the variable abundance of Lactobacillus and Escherichia-Shigella in suckling piglets .In the early postnatal period the piglets' gut microbiota had more shared OTUs with SV SM and FL and all these OTUs together made up all the core microbiota in the PF.

This study suggests that microbes from the maternal and sur- rounding environments may play an important role in the microbial succession of newborn piglets after birth.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The gut ecosystem of newborn animals characterizes unstable and a drastic variation in microbial composition which affected by complicated factors including the delivery mode maternal microbiota feeding type and habitat .

As a great exploring area to an infant SN might transfer microbiota to a piglet's gut directly or via breast milk however further studies are needed to understand the role of milk-derived microbes on the gut development and health of young animals.PICRUSt was used to further investigate the bacterial function of all the samples and to gain more insight into the succession of piglets' gut microbiota during lactation.

Although the fundamental role of infant gut microbiota in animal health has attracted many researchers to explain the development process e information on the succession of gut microbiota of the neonate during early life is limited.The earliest settlers in infant gut are facultative anaerobes namely enterobacteria enterococci and staphylococci and then an- aerobes such as bifidobacteria Bacteroides and clostridia get into the immature gut and settle down .

The piglets were weaned at the age of 21 d. Allsamples were stored at 28 oC for further microbial compositionanalysis.DNA extraction PCR amplification and Illumina MiSeq sequencingThe total genomic DNA was isolated from PF SF SM SV and washing fluids from the FL and SN by using a commercially avail- able stool DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's in- structions QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit Qiagen Hilden Germany.
