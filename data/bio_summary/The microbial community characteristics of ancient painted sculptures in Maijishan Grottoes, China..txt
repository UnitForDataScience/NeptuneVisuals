Of the 77 total OTUs the three libraries from MJ4-1 MJ4-2 and MJ4-3 had 37 OTUs in common.Actually the OTUs shared by all four libraries were completely overlapped with the OTUs shared by these three samples with the exception of only 3 OTUs.

These unique OTUs comprised 11.84 1847 of the total reads in the MJ4-4 library and were dominated by Proteobacteria 107 OTUs 486 reads and Actinobacteria 98 OTUs 364 reads.For fungi the heatmap  was based on the top 50 fungal families.

Meanwhile the reads of Firmicutes fluctuated in the different samples the read propor- tion reached the lowest value in MJ4-1 and it was the fourth largest phylum 11.04 1723 reads in MJ4-4 which occurred after Cyanobacteria 25.45 3969 reads and Proteobacteria 22.31 3479 reads.

Ascomycota dominated in the shared OTUs as well as the reads of the shared OTUs   and the rest of the shared OTUs belonged to Basidiomycota.

The other lineages represented a much smaller fraction ca 4.10 72 OTUs 0.5 317 reads of the bacterial community.At the genus level the genera of Pseudonocardia and Saccharopolyspora accounted for only 5.41 of the total OTUs but 54.06 of the total reads 18.80-78.90.

The raw reads were deposited into the NCBI Sequence Read Archive SRA database SRA accession SRP095989.ResultsMiSeq sequencing results and a-diversity indicesFrom the four samples 133014 valid reads and 1757 OTUs were obtained for bacteria.

However Actinobacteria showed a high variability in the read abundance of different samples in decreasing order of abundance the results are MJ4-1 92.08 14361 reads MJ4-2 83.56 13032 reads MJ4-3 58.99 9201 reads and MJ4-4 33.0 5147reads.

The members of Acidobacteria Bacteroidetes Chloroflexi Cyanobacte- ria and Proteobacteria comprised 0.16 99 reads 5.45 3402 reads 0.27 171 reads6.76 4218 reads and 7.25 4521 reads respectively in the total bacterial community.

Eigh- teen OTUs with abundances higher than 0.5 in the bacterial community were sorted from total of 1757 OTUs and defined as predominant OTUs.
