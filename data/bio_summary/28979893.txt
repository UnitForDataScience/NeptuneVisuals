however irrespective of the type of mediator the main deviation of the immune response in the prenatally stressed offspring is the up-regulation of th-2 response which may predispose in asthma development.pathways through which mps may affect offspring outcomesillustrates briefly the mechanisms discussed in the next sections.maternal environmentthe most important mechanism involved in the association between mps and offspring outcomes is the hypothalamic-pitui- tary-adrenal hpa.

the results were independ- ent from paternal psychological distress during pregnancy or maternal and paternal psychological distress after delivery.the relationship between mps and asthma in the offspring seems to be influenced by the type of mps and the age of onset of asthma symptoms.

furthermore mps has been associated with a higher risk for a variety of immune and metabolic alterations in the offspring such as asthma allergic disorders cardiovascular diseases hypertension hyperlipidemia diabetes mellitus and obesity   -.studies indicate that mps may also affect the offspring's bacte- rial colonization .

it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that mps may be related to future disorders of the offspring which develop through the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune pathways such as asthma .the adaptive immune mechanism constitutes a critical path- way for the development of asthma which is characterized by a th2-dominated immune response il-4 il-5 il-13 and a down regulated th-1 response il-2 and ifn-g. additionally othertypes of t cell subsets such as regulatory t cells which produceil-10 and tgf-b as well as th17 cells which produce il-17 may confer to asthma development possibly by skewing the immu- nological response toward the th-2 type .

associations between mps conceptualized at each of these three overlying stress levels and child outcomes have been reported .there is only a small body of literature on the prevalence of mps but probably its influence on maternal health has been underestimated available evidence indicates that prevalence of mps is relatively high.

these periods are depended on the maturation stage of immune system and they may be different among species.although there are several studies exploring the relationship of mps and immune response of the offspring there is only a small number of experimental studies investigating the effects of mps on the airway inflammation in the offspring.

the importance of mps has been emphasized by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists who recommend regular assessment of pregnant women for psychosocial risk factors and if needed supportive interventions to help women cope with the psychosocial stress- ors -.prenatal maternal stress and immune response--airway inflammationthere is very strong evidence mainly from experimental studies that mps modulates the immune response of the offspring .

amongst them mps imposed imbalances in fetal and offspring's microbiota is the less explored and the more promising to unravel--at least partially--the complex association between mps and asthma.

overall the study showed that the prevalence of wheezing or asthma was higher in children whose mothers had been exposed to some kind of prenatal stress than in mothers who had not experienced such a distress .conclusion and futureperspectivesseveral types of mps seem to increase the vulnerability of the offspring to asthma through interrelated pathways.

following studies in animal models that linked physical or psychological stress with allergy and asthma in the first decade of the 21st century researchers worked on the early-life stress and the consequences in asthma development later on.in 2006 a team from charite berlin germany described an increased vulnerability toward asthma specific clinical features in prenatally stressed offspring mice .

in general the effect of mps on the innate immunity function of the offspring is inhibitory as mps attenuates macrophages and neutrophils functions such as spreading and phagocytosis and decreases at least in some models nk cytotoxicity .

maternal prenatal stress mps in particular may cause a series of alterations in the developing fetus influence early life events and have long-lasting consequences in the offspring   .

it was also observed that total serum ige was significantly elevated in the stressed sensitized group implying a degree of dysregulation of the humoral immune response.a major mediator of the mps action on the offspring's immune response is maternal glucocorticoids.

oxidative stress  as well as maternal catecholamines and opioids  may also play the role of mediator.it seems therefore that there are multiple candidate media- tors of the mps effects on the offspring's immune development.
