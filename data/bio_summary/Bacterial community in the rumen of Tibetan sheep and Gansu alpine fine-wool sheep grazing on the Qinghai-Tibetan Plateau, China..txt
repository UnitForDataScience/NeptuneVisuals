the proportion of bacteroidetes in the gs rumen 30.8 wasalmost twice that in ts 16.8. among the bacteria that comprised the bacteroidetes subdivision only one otu four clones in ts was closely related to bacteroidales bacterium p59 which had been previously isolated in bovine rumen and the remaining nine otus were not re- lated to any cultivated bacteria nyonyo et al.

1961. gs con- tained more uncultured rumen bacteria than ts in uncul- tured groups 9 and 10 which indicates that more specific rumen bacteria in these groups might have co-evolved with gs.an uncommon bacterial phylum identified in ts 1.9 and gs 3.2 was proteobacteria which is found in a variety of ruminants such as sheep cattle and goats but none or a very low proportion 0.8 was observed in yaks an et al.

2011b.in gs nearly half 48.9 of the bacteria in rumen sam- ples were uncultured bacteria and the identified bacteria differed between ts and gs.

within firmicutes 34 out of 40 otus belonged to 74 outof 85 clones obtained from ts and 25 out of 33 otus belonged to 46 out of 59 clones obtained from gs repre- sented uncultured bacteria showing 97 nucleotide identity to known cultured species which clustered into seven individual groups uncultured groups 1-7. how- ever only one otu four clones of ts represented a cul- tured species within bacteroidetes and the remaining se- quences formed four novel clusters uncultured groups 8-11 that were not similar to any cultivated rumen bacteria.

among the 7 groups ts con- tained more uncultured rumen bacteria in uncultured groups 2-7 than gs which indicates that more specific rumen bacteria might have co-evolved with ts.

2013. in gs 11 otus were uncultured bacteria and three uniden- tified otus g21 g11 and g8 belonged to the bacteroidetes subdivision and clustered closely with prevotella ruminicola which is one of the most impor- tant amino acid fermenting bacteria originally identified in the rumen of other ruminants these results indicate that there were some uncharacterized prevotella ruminicola- related groups in gs rumen bladen et al.

the coverage of the clone library of 16s rrna gene were 76.6 ts and 79.8 gs which indicates that more than 70 of the rumen sequence types were found in both libraries table 1. dominant and common rumen bacteria of ts and gs were probably detected.rarefaction curves were calculated to assess whether the sampling and sequencing efforts provided efficient otu coverage and showed a trend toward reaching a plateaufig.

the richness values estimated by sace and schao1 of ts 77.9 and 70.6 seemed to be both higher than those of gs 65.2 and 55.0 but the differences were in- significant because of the overlaps of their 95 confiden- tial intervals table 1.sequence analysis of 16s rrnaof the 107 clones isolated from the ts library 15 clones comprising 7 otus and representing 14.0 of the total clones had 97 identity to known species of rumen bac- teria 24 clones 10 otus and representing 22.4 of the total clones were 90-96 similar to database sequences of known cultured bacteria and the remaining 68 clones 36 otus and representing 63.6 of the total clones showed 90 similarity of 16s rdna with any cultured species.
