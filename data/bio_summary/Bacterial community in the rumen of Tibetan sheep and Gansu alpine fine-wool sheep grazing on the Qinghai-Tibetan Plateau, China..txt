The richness values estimated by SACE and SChao1 of TS 77.9 and 70.6 seemed to be both higher than those of GS 65.2 and 55.0 but the differences were in- significant because of the overlaps of their 95 confiden- tial intervals Table 1.Sequence analysis of 16S rRNAOf the 107 clones isolated from the TS library 15 clones comprising 7 OTUs and representing 14.0 of the total clones had 97 identity to known species of rumen bac- teria 24 clones 10 OTUs and representing 22.4 of the total clones were 90-96 similar to database sequences of known cultured bacteria and the remaining 68 clones 36 OTUs and representing 63.6 of the total clones showed 90 similarity of 16S rDNA with any cultured species.

GS con- tained more uncultured rumen bacteria than TS in uncul- tured groups 9 and 10 which indicates that more specific rumen bacteria in these groups might have co-evolved with GS.An uncommon bacterial phylum identified in TS 1.9 and GS 3.2 was Proteobacteria which is found in a variety of ruminants such as sheep cattle and goats but none or a very low proportion 0.8 was observed in yaks An et al.

Within the GS clone library 13 clones 8 OTUs and representing 13.8 of the total clones had 97 simi- larity with known cultured species in 94 obtained clones 37 clones 8 OTUs and representing 39.4 of the total clones and the remaining 44 clones 20 OTUs and repre- senting 46.8 of the total clones showed 90-96 andTable 2.Distributions of the rumen bacterial 16S rRNA OTUs and clones depending on the sequence similarity to known cultured species.ItemsTSGSNo.

Among the bacteria that comprised the Bacteroidetes subdivision only one OTU four clones in TS was closely related to Bacteroidales bacterium P59 which had been previously isolated in bovine rumen and the remaining nine OTUs were not re- lated to any cultivated bacteria Nyonyo et al.

2011b.In GS nearly half 48.9 of the bacteria in rumen sam- ples were uncultured bacteria and the identified bacteria differed between TS and GS.

In GS 11 OTUs were uncultured bacteria and three uniden- tified OTUs G21 G11 and G8 belonged to the Bacteroidetes subdivision and clustered closely with Prevotella ruminicola which is one of the most impor- tant amino acid fermenting bacteria originally identified in the rumen of other ruminants these results indicate that there were some uncharacterized Prevotella ruminicola- related groups in GS rumen Bladen et al.

Within Bacteroidetes the propor- tion of uncultured bacteria was still high in both sheep breeds 13.1 of the clones in TS and 30.8 in GS and Bacteroidales bacterium P59 four clones was only found in TS.Sequences that belonged to Proteobacteria were rare but were present in both samples.

Among the 7 groups TS con- tained more uncultured rumen bacteria in uncultured groups 2-7 than GS which indicates that more specific rumen bacteria might have co-evolved with TS.

2011a.The proportion of uncultured bacteria within Firmicutes was higher in TS than GS and a similarity analysis re- vealed that TS had 15 clones seven OTUs that shared97 similarity with the following cultured rumen bacte- ria Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens Oribacterium sp.
