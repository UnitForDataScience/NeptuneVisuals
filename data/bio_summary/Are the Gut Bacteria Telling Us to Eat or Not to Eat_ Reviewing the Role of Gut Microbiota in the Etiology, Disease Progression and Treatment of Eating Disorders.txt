Understanding the role of the gut ecosystem in the pathophysiology of eating disorders will provide critical insights into improving current treatments and developing novel microbiome-based interventions that will benefit patients with eating disorders.Keywords gut microbiota eating disorders appetite control psychological stressIntroductionEating disorders are severe mental illnesses that occur on a continuum with behaviors shared across syndromes that negatively influence cognitive physiological and social functioning.

While most point to negative body image andor concerns with body weight as the primary etiology of eating disorders and thus they are classified as mental illnesses evidence for disturbed appetitive and feeding pathways suggest that eating disorders may also be biologically-driven.

Given that host diet is a key determinant of the gut microbial profile and eating disorders are characterized by dysregulated food intake it is only logical to assume at least an associative relationship between eating disorders and an altered gut microbiota.

The latter may be particularly relevant to the pathogenesis and progression of eating disorders as Fetissov and colleagues  revealed that a subgroup of patients with AN and BN had autoantibodies that bind to the a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone MSH and the circulating level of these autoantibodies was correlated with the psychological traits of eating disorders.

Finally data on the bacterial protein C1pB produced by both commensal and pathogenic microorganisms as a mimetic of a-MSH and its effects on activating host satiety pathways in rodents  as well as the elevated plasma concentration of anti-C1pB IgG that is cross-reactive with a-MSH in patients with eating disorders  accord with the notion that autoantibody-induced interference with the central melanocortin system is one of the key microbiota-gut-brain mechanisms that contributes to dysregulated appetite control in eating disorders.Effects of Gut Microbiota on Brain Function and BehaviorWe next explore the effects of microbiota on the gut-brain axis in the context of psychobehavioral abnormalities associated with eating disorders.

The potential distinct effects of eating disorders on barrier function of different parts of the gut warrant further investigation but a localized effect on the colon may provide further support for a predominant role of microbes that primarily reside in the colon in mediating gut dysfunction in eating disorders.Therapeutic Potential of Microbiome-Based Treatments for Eating DisordersThere is a growing body of evidence suggesting that gut microbiota is mechanistically involved in changes in physiological function throughout the etiology progression and treatment of eating disorders Figure .

Specifically generating high quality longitudinal metagenomic data that characterize the gut ecosystem structure and functions are the key short-term goals for two important purposes 1 cohorts of high-risk individuals allow insights into the role of gut microbiota in the etiology of eating disorders and 2 following cohorts of patients with eating disorders would allow advances in our understanding of how the gut microbiota changes with clinical observations and whether causality exists.

1-848-932-5673 Received 6 April 2017 Accepted 7 June 2017 Published 14 June 2017Abstract Traditionally recognized as mental illnesses eating disorders are increasingly appreciated to be biologically-driven.

Gut bacteria may act on the gut-brain axis to alter appetite control and brain function as part of the genesis of eating disorders.

Given the established causality between dysbiosis and metabolic diseases an altered gut microbial profile is likely to play a role in the co-morbidities of eating disorders with altered immune function short-chain fatty acid production and the gut barrier being the key mechanistic links.
