The latter was com- piled to hold tetra-nucleotide compositions 7 and gyrB and recA sequences from all available genome sequences of type orrepresentative strains.

As in the case of the 16S rRNA gene the construction of a quality-controlled genome database of all type strains is a prerequisite for the wider application of genomics-based taxonomy .At present almost 70 000 genome sequences are available in the primary public databases such as the NCBI Assembly Database .

We expect that the portion of WGAs identified at the speciessubspecies level will be increased as more genome sequences become available for type strains.Genome-derived taxonomic informationThe genome is the ultimate source for taxonomy in which a variety of information can be extracted for a better descrip- tion of the species.

Several overall genomerelatedness indices OGRIs were proposed to define species boundaries  For example average nucleotide identity ANI and OrthoANI 0 suggested a species boundary of 95-96 .Because genome sequences can be used for assessing suprageneric phylogeny recognizing species  and differentiating clinical clones with few single nucleotide polymorphisms  it is evident that their use in the taxon- omy of the Bacteria and Archaea will greatly improve not just taxonomy but also other microbiological disciplines.

Here we introduce an integrated database with a complete taxonomic hierarchy of the Bacteria and Archaea that is represented by 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences.

16S rRNA gyrB and recA genes in WGAs were predicted while sequences were processed in our genome annotationpipeline Fig.

If this was not possible due to the lack of 16S rRNA gyrB and recAgene sequences the WGA was assigned as 'Unidentified'.Calculation of genomic features for each taxonSeveral genomic features of taxonomic importance includ- ing genome sizes DNA GC content the number of genes and lengths of CDS coding sequencesintergenic regions were calculated and compiled statistically for each taxon.

Informa- tion on the number of 16S rRNA genes in genomes was obtained from complete genome sequences.
