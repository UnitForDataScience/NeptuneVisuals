Overall Metastat analysis and modeling of bacterial taxa against salinity gradient underscored the importance of salinity as one of the key environmental variable that shapes the sedimentary bacterial com- munity composition in the Chilika Lagoon.Potential functional roles of the bulk and rhizosphere communitiesMetabolic mapping of bacterial OTUs further highlighted the role of sediment bacterial communities in the biogeochemical cycling as well as in the transformation and degradation of various pollutants.

In the present study as large number of bulk sediment communities were sequenced we expanded our investigation to conduct a more detailed comparative assessment of bulk and P. karka rhizosphere communities to examine how sedimentary bacterial com- munities are structured by the presence of an emergent macrophyte such as P. karka.Our hypothesis was that bacterial communities would exhibit bio- geographical patterns which would be strongly associated with the bi- otic e.g.

singletons were ignored while compar- ing the richness and community structure across different samples.Quantitative PCR qPCR for determining sedimentary bacterial pop- ulation sizesTotal bacterial population sizes in the bulk and P. karka rhizosphere sediments were determined by qPCR of bacterial 16S rRNA genes using primer set Eub338F and Eub518r .

Overall the NMDS analysis of bacterial communities suggested a high degree of variability in bacterial community composition that was attributed to various biotic and abiotic factors existing in the Chilika Lagoon.Bulk and rhizosphere communities were clearly delineatedTotal bacterial population sizes as estimated by qPCR suggested a significantly F  8.710 Welch ANOVA p-value  0.004 higher bacte- rial cell density in the P. karka rhizosphere 7.52 - 9.42 x 108 cells g-1 than the bulk 3.67 - 4.68 x 108 cells g-1 sediments Supp.

Given the availability of data on bacterial communities from bulk sediment samples that were collected on different dates from the same sector or on the same day but from different sectors we were able to address the questions how bulk sediment bacterial communities changed at small geographic distances over time and space .

Future re- search should use qPCR for estimating the abundance of specific func- tional groups of bacteria in the rhizosphere and bulk sediments to get a quantitative insight on the biogeochemical potential of sedimentary bacterial communities.One of the 'metabolic' phenotype that was predicted in the bulk andrhizosphere sediment communities albeit in low abundance b 0.5 was 'violacein producer' which provides an important insight on the adaptive mechanism of the bacterial communities in coastal environ- ment.

The aims of this study were i to characterize the spatial and temporal dy- namics of sedimentary bacterial communities along estuarine salinity gradient and ii to compare the bacterial communities of the bulk sed- iments with the rhizosphere communities of a common reed P. karka and a native seagrass Halodule uninervis species.

In order to estimate bacterial carbon corresponding to the bacterial abundanceswe adopted a conversion factor of 1.79 x 10-14 g carbon per cell  which suggested that bacterial carbon  in sediment var- ied between 0.00004055 and 0.00575478.
