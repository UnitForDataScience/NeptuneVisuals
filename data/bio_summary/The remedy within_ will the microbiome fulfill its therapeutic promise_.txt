This hope has fueled numerous investigations into the identity of microbiome-altering stimuli and the nature of microbial contributions to human health and disease.As good luck would have it fecal microbiota transplantationOne prototypical microbiome-based intervention that has recent- ly been introduced into routine clinical practice serves as a refer- ence point for the continued hope that microbiome science may ultimately establish new approaches for the rational therapy of amultitude of diseases fecal microbiota transplantation FMT in cases of recurrent intestinal infection with antibiotic-resistant Clostridium difficile .

In addition to the inter-individual variability in microbiota composition of the FMT recipient an additional variable that necessitates a thorough understanding is the donor microbiota .

PostbioticsWhat is past is prologue the neglected microbial organDespite Ilya Metchnikoff's visionary work about the impor- tance of intestinal bacteria for the physiology of the host more than 100 years ago for most of the twentieth century the entirety of microorganisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract--now called the intestinal microbiota--has been primar- ily appreciated for assisting in the digestion of dietary nutri- ents while any physiological or pathophysiological role be- yond this function was largely ignored.

Remarkably many of these environmental influences have been shown to shape the ecology of the microbiota such as its taxonomic composition and functional capacities leading to the hypothesis that certain environmental factors may exert their impact on host physiology and disease via the microbial community located at the body's surface .

The advent of two Eran Elinav 1 Immunology Department Weizmann Institute of Science Rehovot Israelbranches of new technology have rapidly changed our percep- tion of the microbiome the entirety of microbial genes over the last 10 years the metagenomic sequencing of the DNA and RNA repertoires present in the intestinal ecosystem and the re-emergence of gnotobiotic approaches enabling controlled microbial colonization of a mammalian intestine .

These local and systemic effects of the microbiome are mediated through immune system modulation and by secretion of structural ele- ments of the microbial cell such as cell wall components and nucleic acids  as well as products of microbial metabolism including metabolites and proteins .

A potential microbiome involvement in the treatment of these diseases will possibly in- volve long-term strategies of microbial ecosystem engineering or more targeted pharmacological approaches that are built on but do not directly interfere with microbial colonization.

Proof- of-concept studies in this area indicate that it might be possible to administer engineered bacteria with the goal of achieving local therapeutic actions but such methods need rigorous as- sessment with respect to safety and long-term maintenance upon successful administration.Additionally targeted interventions with the microbial eco- system could be achieved through bacteriophages  a prominent component of the intestinal microbiome with the capacity to regulate the microbial genepool.

In contrast to pre- and probiotics which aim at altering the composition of the microbial community such Bpostbiotics bypass the complex modulation of microbial ecology and directly exert an effect on the host .
