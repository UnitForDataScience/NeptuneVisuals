The gut microbiota of individuals with PsA had less reportedly beneficial organisms than that of people with psoriasis and was similar to that of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.5PsA Manifestations A wide range of joint abnormalities is associ- ated with PsA including synovitis dactylitis ankyloses enthesitis and arthritis mutilans.16 The pathology of PsA differs from that of rheumatoid arthritis RA in multiple ways as follows.Synovio-entheseal complex SEC.

2016745 suppl 1AB234.Psoriatic Arthritis Pathogenesis and Treatmentsoriatic arthritis PsA affects about 20 to 30 of individ- uals with psoriasis and follows the development of psoriasis in these individuals by about 10 years.1 This article reviewsthe pathogenesis of PsA and its relationship to psoriasis and compares features of PsA to those of rheumatoid arthritis RA.

Weight gain from age 18 to follow-up measurement as well as higher waist circumference hip circumference and waist- to-hip ratio were associated with higher risk of incident psoriasis.3 Higher BMI categories also were linked to a greater risk of incident PsA over 5 years among individuals with psoriasis in a UK general population database n75395 P0.001 for trend.4Microbiome The Gut and PsA Data increasingly suggest a link between intestinal microbiota gut inflammation and spondylo- arthropathies SpAs such as PsA.

Dkk-1 levels responded to anti-TNF-a therapy differently in PsA and in RA Dkk-1 levels were lower in PsA than in RA after 1 year of TNF-a inhibitor treatment.

The new therapies are associated with improved efficacy rates and differing safety profiles with which clinicians must become familiar.Roughly 20 to 30 of individuals with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis PsA.

The anti-IL-23 agents in late-stage development will form the next wave of new medications.Authors Kenneth B. Gordon MD Craig L. Leonardi MDReferencesLeonardi CL Kimball AB Papp KA et al.

Concomitant fungal skin infections most commonly tinea pedis were present in 42.8 of 2716 patients with onychomycosis in one series.5 Treating all infection sites may prevent transmission within the individual or to others and may reduce the risk of recurrence.6-8Oral Therapy Options include terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 to 16 weeks itraconazole in a pulse 400 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months or continuous regimen 200 mg once daily for 12 weeks9 off- label fluconazole therapy 150 to 450 mg weekly for 4 to 12 months and posaconazole 100 200 or 400 mg once daily for 24 weeks.110 Efficacy of itraconazole pulse therapy is comparable to that of terbinafine terbi- nafine carries a higher rate of adverse events and treatment-related discontinuation.11An investigational therapy VT-1161 demonstrated 48-week complete cure rates of 32 to 55 in a phase IIb study according to a preliminary report.
