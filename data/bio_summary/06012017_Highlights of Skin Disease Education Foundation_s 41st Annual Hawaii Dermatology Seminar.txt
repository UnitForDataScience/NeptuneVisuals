The gut microbiota of individuals with PsA had less reportedly beneficial organisms than that of people with psoriasis and was similar to that of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.5PsA Manifestations A wide range of joint abnormalities is associ- ated with PsA including synovitis dactylitis ankyloses enthesitis and arthritis mutilans.16 The pathology of PsA differs from that of rheumatoid arthritis RA in multiple ways as follows.Synovio-entheseal complex SEC.

2016745 suppl 1AB234.Psoriatic Arthritis Pathogenesis and Treatmentsoriatic arthritis PsA affects about 20 to 30 of individ- uals with psoriasis and follows the development of psoriasis in these individuals by about 10 years.1 This article reviewsthe pathogenesis of PsA and its relationship to psoriasis and compares features of PsA to those of rheumatoid arthritis RA.

Weight gain from age 18 to follow-up measurement as well as higher waist circumference hip circumference and waist- to-hip ratio were associated with higher risk of incident psoriasis.3 Higher BMI categories also were linked to a greater risk of incident PsA over 5 years among individuals with psoriasis in a UK general population database n75395 P0.001 for trend.4Microbiome The Gut and PsA Data increasingly suggest a link between intestinal microbiota gut inflammation and spondylo- arthropathies SpAs such as PsA.

Dkk-1 levels responded to anti-TNF-a therapy differently in PsA and in RA Dkk-1 levels were lower in PsA than in RA after 1 year of TNF-a inhibitor treatment.

The new therapies are associated with improved efficacy rates and differing safety profiles with which clinicians must become familiar.Roughly 20 to 30 of individuals with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis PsA.

The anti-IL-23 agents in late-stage development will form the next wave of new medications.Authors Kenneth B. Gordon MD Craig L. Leonardi MDReferencesLeonardi CL Kimball AB Papp KA et al.
