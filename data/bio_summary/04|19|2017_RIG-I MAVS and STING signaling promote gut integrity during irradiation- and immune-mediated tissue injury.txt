Unlike chemical injury of intestinal mucosa irradiation- or chemotherapy- induced intestinal barrier dysfunction is a problem clinically.Mucosal barriers like the intestinal epithelial cell IEC layer protect sterile microenvironments from physical chemical and microbial challenge.

Epithelial integrity depends on constant and inducible IEC renewal by pluripotent intestinal stem cells ISCs which reside in the stem cell niche at the base of each intestinal crypt 12.

S1E.MAVS signaling in nonhematopoietic cells maintains intestinal barrier function and attenuates GVHD in miceGiven that the RIG-IMAVS pathway senses bacterial RNA 18 one hypothesis to explain our findings is that there may be mouse strain-specific differences in the intestinal bacterial microbiota.

MAVS signaling in nonhematopoietic cells maintains intestinal barrier functionA Average relative abundance of bacterial genera in the intestinal microbiota of cohoused Mavs n  5 and Mavs-- n  5 litter-mates.

During allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation allo-HSCT alteration of intestinal barrier function by chemotherapy or TBI administered before transplant has detrimental consequences Misplaced bacterial components together with endogenous danger signals released during epithelial cell death are sensed by pattern recognition receptors on antigen-presenting cells which then produce proinflammatory cytokines and prime donor-derived T cells 13.

We also observed that Lysozyme P and Lgr5 expression was reduced in mice 24 hours after TBI suggesting that the lack of efficacy of 3pRNA after allo-HSCT could at least in part be due to fewer target cells in the intestinal epithelium fig.

BM cells 5 x 106 plus T cells 1x 106 from C57BL6 WT mice were transplanted into BALBc recipient mice with or without 3pRNA treatment on day -1 before allo-HSCT and treatment with IFNAR1- blocking antibody a-IFNAR1 or immunoglobulin G1 IgG1 isotype control on day -2 before allo-HSCT.

BM cells 5 x 106 plus T cells 1 x 106 from C57BL6 WT mice were transplanted into BALBc recipient mice with or without 3pRNA treatment on day -1 before allo-HSCT and treatment with IFNAR1-blocking antibody a-IFNAR1 48 hours before allo-HSCT -48 h before TX at the time of allo-HSCT 0 h before TX or 24 hours afterallo-HSCT 24 h after TX.

BM cells 5 x 106 plus T cells 5 x 106 from BALBcdonor mice transplanted into C57BL6 recipient mice genotypes are indicated in the figure with or without 3pRNA treatment on day -1.

However application of 3pRNA on day -1 before allo-HSCT along with A20- Luc-transduced lymphoma cells did not diminish GVL activity against the latter compared to control allo-HSCT recipient WT mice who did not receive 3pRNA fig.
