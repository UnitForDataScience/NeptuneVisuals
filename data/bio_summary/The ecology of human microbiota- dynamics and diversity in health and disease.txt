These findings reflect the fact that attempts to characterize the human core micro- biota have not been successful instead the concept of human core microbiome has been proposed.12The purpose of this review is to promote the uti- lization of ecological theory when trying to deter- mine the factors that drive the dynamics of the human microbiota.15-17 Previously the diversity structure and functions of the human microbiome have been characterized14 as well as factors related to stability and resilience.12 Coyte et al.17 studied the ecology of the microbiome and Costello et al.16 provided insight into the ecological theory behind community assembly.

The role of the microbiome in health and disease has also been reviewed.1819 Here we will particularly concentrate on address- ing the role of microbial diversity versus the actual community composition in human health and link underlying ecological processes to observed patterns in the human microbiota with a focus on disease states.The ecology of human microbiota in theory and practiceThe human microbiota consists of millions of bacte- rial archaeal and small eukaryotic cells and viruses living in our bodies with bacteria being the most studied.

Additionally pathways related to glycolysis carbohydrate metabolism and transport were differently enriched showing the imbalance of energy metabolism in IBD patients.132 Thus even rather small differences in community can be essential for health if important functional properties are linked to changing taxa.The more specified the property is the more likely it is to be found in only certain bacteria as functions regulated by several genes are harder to transfer between individuals.133 This could mean that a strict human symbiont may have devel- oped many important functions interacting with molecules produced by human cells supporting the idea that key species are especially important in human diseases and that such key species are likely to share a long evolutionary history with humans.22134 Currently a lot of information is miss- ing from functional estimates of human micro- biota but this study direction seems especially important.Dysbiosis a consequence of dispersal limitationMany of the above examples suggest that gut microbial composition and health are related and that disease associates with dysbiosis.
