Male Swissalbino mice divided into four groups n 5 10 were fed on nor- mal chow or HFD 58 fat kcal HFD 1 CMN 10 mg kg21 and HFD 1 CMN 10 mg kg21 1 IMOs 1 g kg21 for 12 weeks.

After acclimatization mice were randomized on the basis of body weight and allocated in the following groups NPD fed control mice n 5 10 HFD fed vehicle control mice n 5 10 HFD fed mice supplemented either with CMN 10 mg kg21 body weight or a combination of IMOs 1 g kg21 body weight and CMN 10 mg kg21 body weight per orally n 5 10.

At all the places P  0.05 was considered as the level of statistical significance.ResultsCosupplementation of CMN and IMOs prevented HFD induced metabolic endotoxemia and alteration in abundance of selected gut microbiotaSerum LPS levels were increased upon HFD feeding in mice.

Further CMN supplementation reduced abundances of both these phyla in HFD fed mice whereas a combination of IMOs to CMN increased the FIRM and BACT relative to CMN but there was no significant difference in these abundances when compared to HFD fed mice Fig.

CMN administration along with HFD did not enhance the abundances of BIF ROS and AKK while IMOs and CMN cosupplementation significantly prevented the unto- ward effects of HFD feeding or CMN supplementation on abun- dances of these selected bacteria Fig.
