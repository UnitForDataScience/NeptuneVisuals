male swissalbino mice divided into four groups n 5 10 were fed on nor- mal chow or hfd 58 fat kcal hfd 1 cmn 10 mg kg21 and hfd 1 cmn 10 mg kg21 1 imos 1 g kg21 for 12 weeks.

after acclimatization mice were randomized on the basis of body weight and allocated in the following groups npd fed control mice n 5 10 hfd fed vehicle control mice n 5 10 hfd fed mice supplemented either with cmn 10 mg kg21 body weight or a combination of imos 1 g kg21 body weight and cmn 10 mg kg21 body weight per orally n 5 10. npd mice received distilled water whereas hfd mice received olive oil 0.1 ml10 g body weight to nullify the effect of volume of vehicle and dosing proce- dures.

at all the places p  0.05 was considered as the level of statistical significance.resultscosupplementation of cmn and imos prevented hfd induced metabolic endotoxemia and alteration in abundance of selected gut microbiotaserum lps levels were increased upon hfd feeding in mice.

further cmn supplementation reduced abundances of both these phyla in hfd fed mice whereas a combination of imos to cmn increased the firm and bact relative to cmn but there was no significant difference in these abundances when compared to hfd fed mice fig.

cmn administration along with hfd did not enhance the abundances of bif ros and akk while imos and cmn cosupplementation significantly prevented the unto- ward effects of hfd feeding or cmn supplementation on abun- dances of these selected bacteria fig.

fec hfd fed mice.functionally imos adjunction to cmn increased the cecal scfas levels which were reduced upon hfd feeding or cmn supplementation figs.

these results were further substantiated by gene expression analy- sis for key genes related to inflammation due to lps generation and activation of the inflammatory cascade in the colon which suggested that hfd feeding increased the tlr-4-5 and nfjb expression and cmn administration slightly prevented this effect of hfd feeding.

though cmn alone and its combination with imos did not show any significant change in the blood glucose concentration at different time points compared to hfd fed mice in ogtt but the auc of mice cosupplemented with cmn and imos was found to be significantly less than hfd fed mice fig.

impaired glucose tolerance in ogtt increased fasted blood glucose levels and hyperinsulinemia indicates insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm state and was quite evident in mice fed on hfd only 15617. pol- yuria and polydipsia were also observed in hfd fed mice pro- viding functional proofs for hfd-induced progression of insulin resistance and t2dm.

effects on hfd-induced biochemical histological inflamma- tory and genomic changes in the gastrointestinal tract liver and visceral white adipose tissue were studied.abbreviations ampk 50 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase cmn cinnamaldehyde auc area under curve dbw disembowelled body weight eb evan's blue dye gip gastric inhibitory polypeptide hdl-c high density lipoprotein hfd high fat diet homa homeostatic model assessment il interleukin imos isomalto-oligosaccharides ir insulin resistance ldl-c low density lipoprotein lps lipopolysaccharides mcp-1 macrophagic chemoattractant protein-1 nafl nonalcoholic fatty liver nash nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nefa nonesterified fatty acids npd nor- mal chow or normal pallet diet oct optimal cutting temperature ogtt oral glucose tolerance test oro oil red-o pas periodic acid schiff's pyy peptide yy scfas short chain fatty acids t2dm type 2 diabetes mellitus tnf tumour necrosis factor trpa1 transient receptor potential channel ankyrin1 vwat visceral white adipose tissue.standard gene abbreviations acc acetyl-coa carboxylase acox-1 acyl-coa oxidase 1 cebpa ccaatenhancer-binding protein alpha cld claudins fasn fatty acid synthase g6pase glucose 6 phosphate gk glucokinase gpr g protein coupled receptor hsl hormone sensitive lipase muc mucin genes myd88 myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 nf-jb nuclear factor kappa beta pepck phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ppars peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors socs3 suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 tlrs toll like receptors zo zona occludensbacterial abbreviations akk akkermansia sp.
