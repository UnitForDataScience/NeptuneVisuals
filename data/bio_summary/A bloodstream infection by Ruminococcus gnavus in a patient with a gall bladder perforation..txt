gauvreauii R. toques and R. lactaris that fit into Clostridiales cluster XIVa and also from this case which was identifiable as R. gnavus will be reassigned into a separate family and genus in the future based on molecular identification.Previously reported R. gnavus infections were associated with damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

However human bloodstream infections by R. gnavus have been reported only three times.

We report a case of R. gnavus bloodstream infection in a patient with a gall bladder perforation suggesting its association with damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

R. gnavus was misidentified using biochemical test but 16S rRNA sequencing and Matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were useful for correct identification.

With the advancement of identification method in clinical laboratory more frequent identification of R. gnavus from clinical specimens is expected.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionRuminococcus gnavus is an anaerobic non-spore-forming Gram-positive diplococcus and is a component of the normal in- testinal flora of humans and animals .

R. gnavus is frequently found among human gut microbial communities being present in over 90 of all individuals .

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota with an increase in R. gnavus levels has been reported to be significantly associated with Crohn's disease.

The high-level b-glucuronidase activity of R. gnavus is associated with the formation of toxic compounds .

R. gnavus was reclassified into Genus Blautia however maintaining its original name.

It is possible that such species of R. facesR.
