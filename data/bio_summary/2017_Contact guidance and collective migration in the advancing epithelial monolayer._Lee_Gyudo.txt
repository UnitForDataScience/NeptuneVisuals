Although mechanisms of CG remain elusive  it is now well known that CG cues can drive the elongated shape of a single cell migrat- ing in isolation  fine-tune the differentiation abilities and functions of such a cell  and promote a rapid cell migration .

In addition fingering instabilities appeared at the leading edge in both systems although the fingers in the CG regions were far sharper .Trajectories of cells on the CG substrate comparedwith non-CG substrate were not only faster but also straighter .

Because cell speeds between CG and non-CG substrates were systemically different we compared trajectory shapes to quantify the effect of CG.

The histogram of the angles between the origin and the end-points of each trajec- tory showed a narrower spread in the CG than the non- CG case.

Overall CG caused the x variance sx to decrease by 67 and the y variance sy to decrease by 21 .To better understand the effects of the CG on the advancing cell monolayer we quantified the cell trajec- tories in terms of the migration speed path tortuosity and X or Y forward migration indices Xfmi and Yfmi defined below .

This implies that trajec- tories were much straighter in the CG substrate than in the non-CG case and is consistent with the histo- gram of the angular distributions showing a narrower spread in the CG .The forward migration index FMI represents the preferred direction in the cell movements in 2D spacenXfmi 14 1nxienddiaccumi141 nYfmi 14 1nyienddiaccumi141Here 1  i  n is the index of the cells the first cell has the index 1 the last one n x- or y-end is the final position of the trajectories at each time interval in the x and y-axis respectively and daccum is the accumulated distance.

More controlled conditions for the study of cellular motions can be pro- vided by defined grooved patterning of the cell substrate on the micro-nano scale in a process called contact gui- dance CG .

However the effects of CG on collective cellular migration and cellularcooperativity are not well defined .

Nevertheless so far a fully comprehensive picture of the collective cell behavior in epithelial wound repair with consideration for CG has not yet been achieved.

Here we report a quantitative analysis of collective cellular migra- tion into an empty space with and without CG cues.
