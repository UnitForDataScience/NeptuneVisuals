b deep cervical lymph nodes receive lymph also from tissues of the respiratory tract including nasopharynx nasal mucosa and trachea allowing viral and bacterial particles present in the respiratory tract to interact with immune cells in the same lymphnodes where brain-derived antigens interact with immune cellstissue or in lymphoid tissues where myelin-specific immune responses develop figure 1.in the following i elaborate on some aspects of innate immune function and through examples derived from clinical and experimental studies in ms and conditions of microbe-induced neuroinflammation attempt to conceptualize how infections and microbial encounters could contribute to autoimmunity and inflammatory demyelination in ms.2  complement activation in cns during viral infection and ms although definite proof of a role for viral infections in the etiology of ms is still lacking circumstantial evidence suggests that epstein- barr virus ebv may act as a predisposing factor in individuals who encounter viral mononucleosis during adolescence.3 ebv-related rna has been detected in ms brain lesions and increased levels of antibodies to the ebna1 protein of ebv virus have been docu- mented in patients with ms.3 ebna1 is associated with ebv latency in b lymphocytes and may alter cellular gene transcription profiles in b cells.4 the ability of ebv to infect and activate b cells in a pol- yclonal manner may lower the threshold of once infected b cells to pass through the blood-brain barrier and allow myelin-reactive antibodies produced by plasma cells to react with oligodendrocyte membranes.during viral encephalitis complement is vigorously activated lo- cally in cns as exemplified by west-nile virus wnv encephalitis.

although certain hla gene alleles may impart a propensity to develop t- and b-cell responses against myelin under normal conditions myelin anti- gens promote immune tolerance rather than active immunity.2 where innate immune system comes into play is in turning tolerance into ac- tive immunity.myeloid leukocytes microglia and many other cells of the innate immune system are endowed by toll-like receptors tlr and other pattern-recognition receptors prrs which sense microbial and host- derived molecules associated with infection or tissue damage.

studies in a spontaneous model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis eae with elevated numbers of myelin-reactive t cells show that disease development requires the presence of gut microbiota.15 mechanistic studies suggest that gut microbiota may provide innate immune signals necessary for activation of myelin-reactive t cells because protection afforded by depletion of microbiota is overcome by an artificial innate immune stimulus.16 although a direct role for gut immune system has yet to be proven a potential mechanism which could involve micro- biota and innate immunity is the migration of dendritic cells from gutepithelium to mesenteric lymph nodes.

what makes these inflammatory cascades and their inducers of potential importance also in ms is the fact that they are often the prerequisite of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses and may act as the underlying mecha- nism of turning immune tolerance into active immunity.

innate immune mech- anisms may be well positioned to promote immune responses locally in the brain but activation of myelin-reactive t cells is unlikely to take place only in brain parenchyma especially before advanced dis- ease stages.

in accordance with nearly all au- toimmune diseases ms risk associates with certain genetic variants most importantly with allelic variants of the hla human leukocyte antigen genes.1 hla genes determine the fine specificity of foreign and self-antigen recognition by adaptive immune system.

when myeloid leukocytes such as microglia and dendritic cells en- counter a molecule associated with a microbe or damaged cells they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators which are powerful inducers of active immune responses.

disruption of tolerance to myelin antigens could be the sequelae of innate immune recognition cascades taking place locally in lesions in adjoining cns10  c 2017 john wiley  sons as.

wnv infection leads to phagocytosis of presynaptic vesicles of hip- pocampal neurons which associates with activation of several com- plement components.5 the c1q component of the complement binds normally to antibodies bound in immune complexes.

this is evidence of comple- ment activation during demyelinating autoimmunity in ms. the often elevated numbers of antibody-secreting plasma cells in the same plaques suggests that complement activation could also be caused by antibodies or immune complexes present in ms lesion.

ebv or other viruses with cns tropism could lead to intrathecal antibody produc- tion figure 1 and activate complement by forming antigen-antibody immune complexes.

the presence of terminal activation complexes however does not in itself stand in proof of a role for antibody-virus immune complexes in complement activation in ms lesions.3  microglia act as sentinels of local and systemic infections microglial cells are specialized tissue macrophages which differenti- ate from primitive yolk sack-derived macrophages seeding in cns before birth.

interestingly activated micro- glia upregulate vitamin d receptor and microglia exposed to vitamin d3 were recently shown to reduce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 il-12 and tnfa and increase expression of immu- nomodulatory cytokine il-10.9t-cell recirculation and cns-homingfigure 2 interactions between infectious agents and innate immune system with potential impact in ms pathogenesis.

antibodies form immune complexes which bind complement and lead to formation of terminal activation complexes often seen in ms lesions.
