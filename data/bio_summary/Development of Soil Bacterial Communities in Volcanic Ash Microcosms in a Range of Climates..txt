They found that the non- sterile moist treatment had considerable evidence of chemical erosion of mineral particles providing evidence of bacterial enhancement of weathering.In this study we experimentally investigated the time course of early bacterial community development on volcanic ash by measuring soil chemistry microbial abundance and community composition and also studied how climate might influence this.In particular we set out to test the following hypothesesThat there will be a distinct community of bacteria in freshly weathering ash differing from Bnormal soil communities due to the peculiar chemical conditions of the ash minerals and the lack of carbon and nitrogen and of living plant roots.That the rate of bacterial biomass and soil carbon buildup in volcanic ash will be greater in warmer temperatures due to more rapid growth and activity of both photosyn- thetic and chemotrophic soil microbes and macroscopic photosynthesizers such as bryophytes.That the community composition of the ash will vary from one climate to another but that the ash samples will have more in common with one another than surround- ing soils due to its very distinct chemical environment.Materials and MethodsSoil Sampling and Setting Up of Ash Pot MicrocosmsSampling consisted of a freshly fallen ash taken from the Sakurajima volcano placed in outdoor microcosms in various locations across Japan over a period of several weeks in March 2012 Fig.

This could help to separate the influence of the gauze covering and trays from the effect of unweathered ash substrate.Nevertheless despite these limitations of our study we suggest that it offers intriguing indications of the pace with which a soil bacterial community can build up in sterile vol- canic ash and is suggestive of the role of a variety of unclas- sified branches of bacterial life in the process of soil develop- ment from volcanic ash.ConclusionsOur findings in this experiment suggest that microbial com- munity development on freshly deposited volcanic ash can be surprisingly rapid with a diverse bacterial community that in many respects resembles soil already appearing within 2 years.

Members of these clades should be investigated more closely for their possible biogeo- chemical significance perhaps through enrichment culturing using volcanic ash as a substrate.Unexpectedly the rate of bacterial community develop- ment in terms of bacterial abundance and also organic C and N buildup in the developing ash soil did not show any detectable relationship to site mean annual temperature.Further work on the processes occurring in the develop- ment of volcanic ash into soils could include metagenome and metatranscriptome studies of the soil nucleic acids to give a clearer picture of the processes at work and how these differ from those in soil.

We tested the predictions that there would be 1 a dis- tinctive bacterial community associated with soil develop- ment on volcanic ash including groups previously impli- cated in weathering studies 2 a slower increase in bac- terial abundance and soil C and N accumulation in cooler climates and 3 a distinct communities developing on the same substrate in different climates.

Although soil development that includes weatheringof volcanic materials is generally agreed to be important in the global carbon cycle on geological time scales there is considerable uncertainty in terms of how responsive the soil formation processes development of microbial com- munity buildup of organic matter and weathering itself are to climate -.

There have been few studies which explore the changes in soil chemistry and the microbial communities associated with early soil formation in volcanic ash -.

Characterizing these communities may lead to greater understanding of how soil formation occurs for example in pinpointing potential key processes and mi- crobial taxa which may be involved in chemical weathering and in the initial accumulation of nutrients such as nitrogen in the soil system.Volcanic materials can harbor a high diversity of mi- croorganisms within a few years of deposition .

While phy- la Acidobacteria Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were abun- dant in soil from a nearby 800-year-old forest stand that was sampled for comparison in the developing ash soil the phy- lum Proteobacteria were overwhelmingly the most abundant group comprising 56  of sequences.
