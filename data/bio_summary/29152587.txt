Similarly the system can be used to investigate temporal changes in member interactions to determine how member interactions change in response to perturbations and to experimentally evolve microbial interactions within communities.

Because it is versatile scalable and accessible this synthetic community system has the potential to practically advance knowledge of microbial interactions that occur within both natural and artificial communities.IMPORTANCE Understanding microbial interactions is a fundamental objective in microbiology and ecology.

Thus this synthetic community system has utility to address fundamental questions about a diversity of possible microbial interactions that occur in both natural and engineered ecosys- tems.KEYWORDS Burkholderia Chromobacterium Pseudomonas syringae community ecology microbial metabolomics model microbial systems synthetic communitieshere is modest knowledge about how microorganisms interact with each other in their native habitats and whether these microbial interactions have implications for emergent community or ecosystem properties.

These studies and others suggest that most microbial interactions remain obscure and that improved understanding of some of these interactions likely will provide important insights into microbial community functions.Synthetic microbial systems recently have garnered reinvigorated interest because of their potential to address fundamental unknowns in microbial ecology engineering and systems and synthetic biology   .

These studies and others demonstrate that synthetic microbial communities can be applied in diverse and creative ways to provide insights into the dynamic biological and ecological interactions of microbiomes   with the anticipation that these insights then can be applied to manage these communities toward desired outcomes.We have developed a simple synthetic community system to interrogate exome- tabolite interactions among microbial community members.

Finally interactions that are reliant on volatiles that may off-gas during plate shaking will not be observable.Only cultivable organisms can be applied easily to the system and so if the most functionally important or prevalent members of a community are yet uncultivable their interactions will be difficult to observe with this system.

These interactions have the potential to occur in nature especially when thoughtfulexperimental designs are employed to i include organisms that are naturally cooc- curring or have evidence of interactions and ii manipulate the pertinent primary drivers of natural ecosystems.

METHODS AND PROTOCOLSNovel Systems Biology TechniquesA Synthetic Community System for Probing Microbial Interactions Driven by ExometabolitesJohn L. Chodkowskia abDepartment of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Michigan State University East Lansing Michigan USAa Department of Plant Soil and Microbial Sciences Program in Ecology Evolutionary Biology and Behavior The DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Center and The Plant Resilience Institute Michigan State University East Lansing Michigan USAbABSTRACT Though most microorganisms live within a community we have mod- est knowledge about microbial interactions and their implications for community properties and ecosystem functions.

To advance understanding of microbial interac- tions we describe a straightforward synthetic community system that can be used to interrogate exometabolite interactions among microorganisms.

The filter plate system also known as the Transwell system physically separates microbial popula- tions but allows for chemical interactions via a shared medium reservoir.
