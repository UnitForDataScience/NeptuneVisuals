The bacteria phyla class order and species that were not detected in the blood of the cirrhotic or control subjects are shown in .Expression of Nitic Oxide Signaling Gene Array in Blood Inflammatory CellsWe used the RT2 Profilertm PCR Array Human Nitric Oxide Signaling Pathway Qiagen to determine whether this pathway is activated in blood inflammatory cells 'buffy coat' by the bacterial DNA translocation in the cirrhotic subjects compared to control subjects.

The bacterial DNA quantity was also increased in the blood of cirrhotic subjects compared to control subjects 0.2- 1.1 vs 41.8-132.1 95CI 6.0 to 77.2 P  0.0022 .There were statistically significant relationships between bacterial DNA quantity and some laboratory parameters albumin total bilirubin INR platelets and CRP .

Of interest Santiago et al  detected in the blood of cirrhotic patients 246 283  87 bacterial genera that were not detected in feces of these patients suggesting that in their cohort a substantial percentage of the blood microbiome may have originated outside the fecal microbiome.We suspect that our results measured in the blood plasma are an underestimation of the extent of bacterial DNA translocation in cirrhotic patients given that it has been suggested that more bacteria DNA may be present in circulating inflammatory cells than in plasma  and that our bacterial DNA test was limited to 53 intestinal pathogenic bacterial species.

This result was unexpected since Rantes CCL5 is an important modulator of liver inflammation and its blockade ameliorates experimental liver fibrosis in mice .Similarly the NALP-3 protein expression a key modulator of macrophage Inflammasome  in the buffy coat of cirrhotic patients' blood was moderately increased difference of the means  29650 95 CI -6453 to 65753 .There was a decrease in the plasma levels of LBP in cirrhotic subjects compared to control subjects  P  0.0004.DiscussionOur study provides the first correlative analysis of the blood microbiome inflammatory bio- markers and systemic hemodynamics in a cirrhotic cohort.In the blood of the cirrhotic cohort we detected 19 of 53 bacterial species tested.

In contrast to the report by Santiago et al  we found no bacterial contamination using our Intestinal Infections Microbial DNA qPCR Array method.Nitric oxide was increased in the blood of cirrhotic subjects compared to control subjects and NO blood values correlated negatively to SVR and positively to CO.

The blood of control subjects had only 2 of 12 bacterial orders Bacteroidales and ClostridialesP  0.0041 for cirrhotic subjects in 2 subjects out of 9 .In the cirrhotic cohort we detected 19 out of 53 bacterial species tested and .

No rela- tionship was found between total bacterial DNA and Hgb A1C AST or ALT .In cirrhotic subjects the translocated bacteria corresponded to the following phyla Firmi- cutes 9 bacterial species Protobacteria 6 bacterial species Bacteroides 3 bacterial species and Verrucomicrobia 1 bacterium specie and .The bacterial DNA orders detected in the blood of cirrhotic subjects.

The total bacterial DNA was also increased in the blood of cirrhotic subjects compared to control subjects 0.2- 1.1 vs 41.8-132.1 95 CI 6.0 to 77.2 P  0.0022.

Santiago et at  detected in the blood of cirrhotic patients the genera Akkermansia Bacteriodes Blautia Clostridium Enterococcus and Strepto- coccus but our study further characterized the species as Akkermansia muciniphila Bacter- iodes fragilis Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron Bacteriodes vulgatus Blautia hydrogenotrophica Clostridium perfringens Enterococcus gallinarum Enterococcus casseliflavus Enterococcus faecalis Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus agalactiae.In contrast the study by Santiago et al  was able to identify in the blood of cirrhotic patients bacterial genera not present in our Intestinal Infections Microbial DNA qPCR Array including Oscillospora Phascolarctobacterium Turicibacter Acidaminococcus Desulfovi- brio Eubacterium Catenibacterium Phascolarctobacterium Paraprevotella Sutterella Dorea Alistipes Megasphaera Lactobacillus Megamonas Lachnobacterium Veillonella Bifidobac- terium Prevotella Parabacteroides Ruminococcus Lachnospira Coprococcus Roseburia Succinivibrio and Escherichia.The phyla Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria represented 92 and 89 of the blood bacterial DNA in the study by Santiago and coworkers  and in the present study respectively.

As expected the cirrhotic subjects had evidences of a marked hyperdy- namic circulation compared to control subjects with statistically significant differences in sys- tolic blood pressure SBP diastolic blood pressure DBP mean arterial pressure MAP CO cardiac index CI SVR systemic vascular resistance index SVRI and stroke volume SV Subjects' hemodynamic parameters.
