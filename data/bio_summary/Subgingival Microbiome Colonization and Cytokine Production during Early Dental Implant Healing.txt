Twenty-five patients completed the 12-week study and provided both subgingival plaque and crevicular fluid samples from a recently placed dental implant and a control tooth.Patients in good general health receiving at least one dental implant including the placement of a transmucosal healing abutment were potentially eligible for this study.

The control tooth was the first available tooth mesial to the implant site and was separated from the implant by at least one natural tooth in order to avoid possible influence from the adjacent developing implant sulcus .Probing depths bleeding on probing and supragingival plaque were recorded for the control tooth.

Four and12 weeks after implant placement and abutment connection a dental implant and a natural tooth were sampled in 25 patients for subgingival plaque and gin- gival crevicular fluid GCF around teeth and peri-implant crevicular fluid PICF around implants.

However direct comparisons between dental implant microbiome studies are very difficult due to the different microbial analysis methods used nonstandardized study designs various patient inclusionexclusion criteria and unspecified implant history with respect to when implants were placed prior to the beginning of the study .Dental implants in our study showed lower microbial diversity than control teeth in agreement with other investigations  .

Further- more this model can be used to study the impact of pharmaceutical interventions to potentially alter initial subgingival microbiome formation and early cytokine produc- tion and thereby possibly influence implant success.In summary in this 12-week observational study the subgingival microbiome and cytokine production were similar in teeth and dental implants during early implant healing.

Furthermore future studies can potentially use this human in vivo model to examine initial subgingival microbiota development and simultaneous cytokine production following dental implant placement in patient populations with various systemic diseases and environmental risk factors for implant failure.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy participants.

All patients were assessed for any signs of infection or failure of implant osseointegration at this appoint- ment.Crevicular fluid samples followed by subgingival plaque samples were collected at the dental implant and control tooth sites on patients who continued to be eligible for study participation.

PICF samples were taken from healthy implant sites H-PICF n  14 and failed implant sites F-PICF n  4 at 4 weeks and 12 weeks.
