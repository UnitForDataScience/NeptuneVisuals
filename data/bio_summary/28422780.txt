A more detailed summary of microbiota alterations in IBS can be found in another recent review 98.In conclusion although a fairly consistent pattern regarding gut microbiota of IBS has been described comprising reduced bacte- rial diversity and increased FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio there are wide variations within the IBS population which may partly be explained by findings of variations in the microbiota composi- tion over time but also related to the heterogeneous pathophysiol- ogy of IBS.Gut Microbiota and the Pathophysiology in IBS Apart for characterizing the gut microbiota composition of IBS pa- tients there is also a need to understand the link between microbi- ota and pathophysiology of the disorder.Although individuals who develop IBS after a bout of gastro- enteritis postinfection IBS only comprise a subset of IBS indi- viduals the sevenfold increased risk for developing IBS after a previous GI infection 114 strengthens the hypothesis that aberra- tions in the microbe-host immune interactions is of relevance in IBS pathophysiology 96.

Even if these abnormalities have been demonstrated in IBS as a group for most factors there is a considerable overlap between IBS and healthy individuals and it may be hypothesized that IBS consists of several subgroups with varying underlying mechanisms linked to development of IBS symptoms.In conclusion even though the role of and the interplay be- tween all the potential factors involved in IBS pathophysiology are unknown there is growing evidence that the pathophysiology of IBS at least to a degree include organic changes such as an al- tered microbiota composition.Characterization of the Gut Microbiota in IBSAlbeit no uniform microbiota signature for IBS has yet been es- tablished a large number of studies have identified similar mi- crobial alterations.

For adults a microbiota-based test for IBD and IBS targeting 300 or more bacteria has shown promise as a diagnostic tool for IBD and IBS and as a predictive marker for re- sponse to antitumor necrosis factor therapy in IBD 6178 but also here further validation studies are necessary before clinical use can be recommended.Thus standardized tests determining microbiota profiles for IBD and IBS based on a predefined definition of microbial eubiosis and dysbiosis may be regarded as noninvasive comple- mentary approaches to facilitate diagnoses of GI diseases.

In addition therapies aiming to restore eubiosis in IBD may also be dependent on intestinal inflammation and pathophysiology-related fluctuations of the microbiota composition.Pathophysiology of IBSThe diagnosis of IBS is based on a combination of symptoms ac- cording to the Rome IV criteria with subgrouping of patients cor- responding to their predominant bowel habit into IBS with diarrhea IBS with constipation or mixed IBS with both loose and hard stools 3.

Hopefully such future well-designed large-scale studies will enable the research community to answer whether an altered gut microbiota is the cause to or a consequence of IBS symptoms or other IBS-related factors and if so how themicrobiota influence the complex IBS pathophysiology.Small Bowel Bacteria and Relevance for IBD and IBS The small intestine is relatively inaccessible for gut microbiota analyses which has resulted in relatively few studies analyzing the luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota of this part of the GI tract.

A recent Swedish study showed no alterations in the abundance of the major bacterial phyla and genera or in microbial diversity in jejunal biopsies of IBS patients compared with healthy individuals 145 whereas another study on duodenal aspirate comprising a small number of study individuals revealed significantly lower microbial diversity and altered microbiota composition in the duodenum of IBS patients 111.Currently the small intestinal microbiota in IBD and IBS is in- sufficiently described.

It is likely that the microbial dysbiosis in IBD and IBS is dependent on the natural disease course of IBD and symptom pattern in IBS.

Therefore future bacterial culture and 16S rRNA-based studies evaluating the microbial composition in the different compartments of the small intestine of IBD and IBS also including other pathophysiological factors such as immune and barrier function are needed.Diet Fermentation and GI Symptoms Diet has a strong impact on the GI microbiota and through differ- ent mechanisms diet may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and IBS 102146-148.

However al- though SCFA levels may be reduced in IBD 165 they instead tend to be increased in IBS 166167 which may induce symp- toms such as urgency bloating and abdominal pain as well as Gut Microbiota in IBD and IBS visceral hypersensitivity 168.

It is likely that the microbial dysbiosis within the IBD and IBS popula- tion is dependent on the natural disease course of IBD and differ- ences in symptom patterns of IBS therefore assessment of the microbiota in relationship to confounding factors symptom fluctu- ations and other pathophysiological factors is needed to optimize therapy response in these common diseases.Source of Funding and Conflicts of Interest This study was sup- ported by The Swedish Medical Research Council grants 13409 21691 and 21692 VINNOVA AFA Insurance and The Faculty of Medicine University of Gothenburg.
