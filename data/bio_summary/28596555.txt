the production of active pediocin PA-1 against Listeria innocua DPC3572 was only achieved at low copy level LC3 increasing from 25 uM to 50 uM IPTG concentration.Taken together these results demonstrate the production of active bactofencin A and pediocin PA-1 directlyinto the extracellular medium by E. coli TunerTM DE3 with the low copy state being the most suitable condition for the expression of both bacteriocins.

O'Connor12 Mary C. Rea12 Paul D. Cotter 12 Colin Hill23 R. Paul Ross123The bacteriocins bactofencin A class IId and pediocin PA-1 class IIa are encoded by operons with a similarly clustered gene organization including a structural peptide an immunity protein an ABC transporter and accessory bacteriocin transporter protein.

Remarkably both secreted bacteriocins contained disulfide bonds overcoming one of the major limitations of disulfide bond production in E. coli.This is to our knowledge the first description of the production of bactofencin A in E. coli and the functional analysis of the genes involved in their heterologous production.

innocua DPC3572 were used as the indicator strains for bactofencin A and pediocin PA-1 activityrespectively.that the expressed bactofencin A in the cell-free extracellular fraction is biologically active against the indicator Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.

Induction with 100 uM IPTG led to an increase in the bactofencin A production reaching in 3 hours 50 of the bactofencin Aproduced by the natural producer Lb.

In addition we identify the minimum gene cluster required for the expression of the respective bacteriocins in E. coli and open up new perspectives for the biotechnological production and modification of these and other bacteriocins.ResultsCloning of bactofencin A bfn and pediocin PA-1 ped gene clusters in E. coli.

Although the amount of bactofencin A and pediocin PA-1 produced by E. coli was found to be 4 and 8-fold lower than the bacteriocin produced by an overnight culture of the natural producers it should be noted that this level of bacteriocin production in E. coli is reached in only 3 hours.

Interestingly the production of active bacteriocin in the transformed E. coli TunerTM DE3 cells was not proportional to copy number implying that the bactofencin A antimicrobial activity decreased at the medium-copy state and it became undetectable in the pediocin PA-1 constructs.

MRS and BHI agar plates were refrigerated for two hours prior to incubation at 37 degC under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively for 24 hours.As positive controls of bactofencin A and pediocin PA-1 production the natural producers L. salivarius DPC6502 and P. acidilactici LMG2351 were grown in MRS broth at 37 degC under anaerobic conditions and 30 degC aerobic conditions for 16 h respectively.
