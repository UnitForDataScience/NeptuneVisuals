Transplantation of fecal microbiota from patients with irritable bowel syndrome alters gut function and behavior in recipient mice.

Although the pathogenesis of IBS is poorly understood several studies have shown that the fecal microbiota of IBS patients differs significantly from that of healthy subjects and it may contribute to the onset and maintenance of the disorder 5-7.

aimed to evaluate the impact of fecal microbiota from patients with IBS in a murine model 9.

An additional useful experiment would be the effect of FMT from healthy patients on physiologic processes in a murine model of IBS.
