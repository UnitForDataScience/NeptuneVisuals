among branded lt4 eutiroxr was the mostly taken 94.9 in the study vs. 90.2 in the control group p  0.432. the remaining patients were treated withtirosintr 2.6 in the study group vs. 7.3 in the control groupp  0.644.the calculated compliance for probiotics ingestion was 79.2in the study group.thyroid hormonesthyroid-stimulating hormone ft3 ft4 did not change between study and control group at each visit as well as among visits in the two groups .

only heart rate was significantly higher in the control than in the study group p  0.043.the main cause of hypothyroidism was hashimoto thyroidi-tis occurring with similar incidence both in study and control group 71.8 and 73.2 respectively p  0.916. only two patients 4.88 in the control group presented an iatrogenic hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy or to radioiodine treatment.

in particular lt4 doses were increased six times in four patients the same patient needed three dosage adjustments in the control group and decreased four times inthan in the study group p  0.007. however the mean lt4 daily dose did not differ between groups p  0.419 and among visits p  0.916 in the control group and p  0.970 in the study group.

however lt4 dose wasnot correlated with serum ft3 levels in any group study group rho  -0.041 p  0.579 control group rho  -0.079 p  0.289.peripheral tissue markersall the peripheral tissue markers of ths evaluated did not change between groups or among visits .considering baseline tsh was directly related to ch rho 0.278p  0.001 ck rho  0.143 p  0.007 myoglobin rho  0.134p  0.010 and ferritin rho  0.187 p  0.001 and inversely to shbg rho  -0.160 p  0.002. ft4 was inversely related to ch rho  -0.247 p  0.001 and myoglobin rho  -0.112 p  0.033 and directly to shbg rho  0.211 p  0.001. ft3 was inversely related to lipoproteina rho  -0.185 p  0.001 and osteocalcin rho  -0.105 p  0.045. at visit 2 tsh remained directly related to ch rho  0.389 p  0.017 and inversely to shbg rho  -0.326 p  0.049. accordingly ft4 remained inversely related to ch rho  -0.372 p  0.025 and directly to shbg rho  0.443 p  0.007. these results confirm that ch and shbg are the most significant tissue effectors of ths action.sixty patients were hypercholesterolemic 30 in the study group and 30 in the control group at baseline considering the proposed cutoff of ch  200 mgdl.

the aim of this study was to assess whether a mixture of highly charged lactobacilli and bifidobacteria vsl3r is able to influence lt4 metabo- lism acting on the gut microbiota.methods a prospective randomized single-blind controlled investigator-started clin- ical trial was carried out.

patients with primary hypothyroidism were randomly assigned to the study vsl3r  lt  and the control group lt .

lt4 dose adjustments were performed when necessary.results thirty-nine patients were enrolled in the study group and 41 in the control group.

ft3ft4 ratio was directly correlated to tsh at each visit in both groups with the exception of the first evaluation of probiotics-treated subjects rho  0.287 p  0.076. lt4 daily dose adjustments occurred more frequently in the control than in the study group p  0.007 despite no differences in the mean lt4 daily dose.

according to inclusion and exclusion criteria 80 participants were enrolled and randomized in study or control group.

the study design provided a monthly visit for a 4 months overall time-frame.

patients assigned to the study group took the pro- biotic supplement vsl3r for 2 months followed by a 2-month period of follow-up .

study group patients were taught to assume the probiotic supple- ment at least 2 h after lt4 administration irrespective of meals to dissolve it in a cold beverage and to store it in a refrigerator 2-8degc in order to preserve bacteria load.

patients assigned to the control group continued their lt4 therapy without placebo administration.the study design was single-blind since only the clinician was aware of the allocation.

table s1 in supplementary material summarizes methodologies used for each assay and the respective intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation.statistical analysisconsidering that no studies so far evaluated the influence of probiotics on hormonal measurements the sample size was cal- culated using a previous study aiming at analyzing the influence on lt4 absorption.

setting a 11 case-control ratiothe final sample size was of 40 patients for each group.continuous parameters were compared between study and control groups through anova univariate andor mann- whitney test according to data distribution evaluated by kolmogorov-smirnov test.
