However LT4 dose wasnot correlated with serum fT3 levels in any group study group rho  -0.041 p  0.579 control group rho  -0.079 p  0.289.Peripheral Tissue MarkersAll the peripheral tissue markers of THs evaluated did not change between groups or among visits .Considering baseline TSH was directly related to CH rho 0.278p  0.001 CK rho  0.143 p  0.007 myoglobin rho  0.134p  0.010 and ferritin rho  0.187 p  0.001 and inversely to SHBG rho  -0.160 p  0.002.

The remaining patients were treated withTirosintr 2.6 in the study group vs. 7.3 in the control groupp  0.644.The calculated compliance for probiotics ingestion was 79.2in the study group.Thyroid HormonesThyroid-stimulating hormone fT3 fT4 did not change between study and control group at each visit as well as among visits in the two groups .

Even if these results show no significant differences in hormonal parameters between groups and among visits a possible probiotics interaction with THs homeostasis is proposed.These data generate the hypothesis of a stabilization of LT4 treatment after probiotics ingestion suggested by the reduced dose adjustments needed in the treatment group as well as the need of a dose reduction observed only in subjects assuming probiotics.

Considering patients with unchanged LT4 dose during the trial90 of the total number of patients the lack of hormonal changes after probiotic treatment remained.As expected LT4 dose was directly related to fT4 in the study rho  0.299 p  0.001 and control group rho  0.457 p  0.001 respectively.

Moreover LT4 dose was inversely related to TSH in the study rho  -0.448 p  0.001 and control group rho  -0.205 p  0.029 respectively.

FT4 was inversely related to CH rho  -0.247 p  0.001 and myoglobin rho  -0.112 p  0.033 and directly to SHBG rho  0.211 p  0.001.

Only heart rate was significantly higher in the control than in the study group p  0.043.The main cause of hypothyroidism was Hashimoto thyroidi-tis occurring with similar incidence both in study and control group 71.8 and 73.2 respectively p  0.916.

Table S1 in Supplementary Material summarizes methodologies used for each assay and the respective intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation.Statistical analysisConsidering that no studies so far evaluated the influence of probiotics on hormonal measurements the sample size was cal- culated using a previous study aiming at analyzing the influence on LT4 absorption.

Nevertheless the use of LC-MSMS is not currently routinely available in clinical practice and our study population does not present the common conditions that may undermine the immunoassay reliability.In conclusion this is the first randomized controlled trial eval- uating possible interactions among probiotics LT4 therapy and pituitary-thyroid axis.

A probiotics- mediated influence on thyroid hormones homeostasis is suggested since probiotics supplementation could be able to prevent serum hormonal fluctuations.iD Registration number NCT03095963.Keywords levothyroxine probiotics VSl3r thyroid-stimulating hormone thyroid hormones gut microbiotainTrODUCTiOnLevothyroxine LT4 is the standard therapeutic choice in hypo- thyroidism replacement therapy .
