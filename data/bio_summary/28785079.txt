We found that short-term EPA-FFA supplementation at a dosage of 2 gdaily was associated with a signif- icant increase of EPA and overall o-3 PUFAs content EPA DPA and DHA into RBCs suggesting that EPA was incorporated by most of patients 1719 and efficiently converted into DPA and DHA.Although the primary end-point of this study was not to test the clinical benefit of EPA-FFA but to explore its effect on mucosal inflammation and new potential chemopreventive mechanisms during long-standing UC we found that short-term EPA-FFA supplementation reduced mucosal inflammation with a significant drop in FC favoring an improvement of both endoscopic and histological inflammation in almost all patients.

Strikingly the increased o-3 PUFAs content was sufficient to induce a rel- evant protective response in UC patients while possibly maintaining the same o-6 PUFAs content as previously suggested.In this study in order to characterize the EPA-FFA short-term effects in long-standing UC patients we first focused on the effects of EPA-FFA supplementation on IL-10STAT3SOCS3 signalling.

Given the critical role of intestinal microbial imbalance in the pathogenesis of UC the fecal and mucosal microbiota compositions were also assessed in our patients.Sequences are available at the following MG-Rast link .To identify the main microbiota dysbioses associated with the long-term UC disease the fecal microbiotacomposition of UC patients at T0 was compared to that of a group of Italian healthy adults age 22-48 years enrolled in the same geographical area of the UC patients.

Median fecal microbiota composition at family level in a healthy adults b UC patients at T0c UC patient at T3 and colon biopsies of d UC patients at T0 and e UC patients at T3 represented as pie chart in available samples from compliant and responder patients.

Thirdly we cannot completely rule out that the clinical outcome observed in our patients could be the result of a potential combined effect between EPA-FFA and stable maintenance of UC therapies such as 5-aminosalicylic acid which is taken by most of the recruited patients.In conclusion in this pilot study EPA-FFA improved endoscopic and histological inflammation affected theIL-10STAT3SOCS3 cascade stimulated goblet cells differentiation and modulated the long-term UC-related colonic alterations of intestinal microbiota.

In conclusion EPA-FFA supplementation reduced mucosal inflammation promoted goblet cells differentiation and modulated intestinal microbiota composition in long-standing UC patients.Patients with ulcerative colitis UC have an increased risk to develop colitis-associated cancer CAC which is proportionally related to the duration and the extent of the disease.

In the present exploratory study patients with long-standing UC in stable clinical remission and active inflammation identified by increased FC values were supplemented with EPA-FFA in order to test its effects on relevant mechanisms associated with UC disease and progression to CAC.ResultsEPA-FFA supplementation induces FC reduction and favors endoscopic and histological remis- sion.

In this pilot study we evaluated the effect of Eicosapentaenoic acid as free fatty acid EPA-FFA supplementation on mucosal disease activity colonic differentiation markers and microbiota composition in UC patients.

Twenty long-standing UC patients in stable clinical remission and withfecal calprotectin FC 150 ugg were enrolled T0 and supplemented with EPA-FFA 2 gdaily for 90 days T3.

To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of EPA-FFA in patients with long-standing UC we investigated the modulation of the IL-10STAT3SOCS3 axis in compliant and responder patients n  15.
