accordingly the analyzed dna could come from i microorganisms that formed the human microbiome and ex- isted in the human organism before death or ii environmen- tal species that contaminated human remains or participated in the body's decomposition process.in this study we analyzed 161 datasets total sequencing  63 bbp collected from 7 different archaeological sites.

however comprehen- sive characterization of microbial dna accompanying human remains has never been done.the current study was performed to characterize microor- ganisms associated with human archaeological remains.

b. detailed information on each sample is summarized in supplementary table s1.all reads were mapped to the reference human genome and the percentage of human reads was determined for each sample.

c the fraction of human adna ranged from 0.01 to 91.9 however in most cases 100 samples it was less than 5. nine samples had more than 50 human adna con- tent.

34 typ- ically found in the human digestive system and in the oral cav- ity was the most abundant taxon in the other human-related group as only m. smithii human gut flora component were iden- tified in our samples supplementary table s2.

addition- ally we mapped reads against a reference human genome to compare in each sample the level of dna damage in human and microbial genomes.

microbial dna damage values differed significantly between samples with different fractions of environmental components 1-way anova ds p  0.0413 dd p  0.0001 1l-1 p  0.0001. the samples with the low- est 25 contribution of environmental bacteria displayed the highest level of microbial dna damage on average ds  0.2643 dd  0.0067 1l-1  2.7933 comparable with those observed for endogenous human adna on average ds  0.3571 dd  0.0279 1l-1  1.6667. noticeably the damage of human adna did not depend on the amount of environmental bacteria in a sample 1-way anova ds p  0.8630 dd p  0.3530 1l-1 p  0.4770 fig.

following uv irradiation the roots of the teeth were drilled using dremelqr  and bone powder was collected to sterile tubes 2 ml and digested for 48 hours at 56c in a buffer con- taining edta urea and proteinase k as described in juras et al.

after digestion dna was purified using the minelute kit qiagen rridscr 008539 according to yang et al.
