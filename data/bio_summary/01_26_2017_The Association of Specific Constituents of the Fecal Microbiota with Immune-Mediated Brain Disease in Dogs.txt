we hypothesized that in fecal samples obtained from dogs with muo there would be a decreased abundance of f.prausnitzii and or prevotellacea com- pared with that found in unaffected dogs.methodsmaterials and methodsfecal samples were collected from dogs 'cases' diagnosed with muo at the veterinary hospi- tals of iowa state university isu and texas am university tamu and stored in a -80c freezer for analysis at completion of case recruitment.

typical cases of muo present with signs of brain dysfunction such as seizures or brainstem dysfunction often disorders of vestibular function although signs of disease any- where in the cns can be caused by muo.

this analysis revealed a tendency toward lower prevalence of muo in animals with higher abundance of f.prausnitzii although this was not statistically significant in this population odds ratio or  0.575 p  0.192. in contrast there was a stronger statistically-significant relationship of reduced likelihood of muo in dogs with higher abundance of prevotellaceae or  0.303 p  0.038 .

none of the unaffected control dogs had been vaccinated within the past month whereas 520 cases had been resulting in a statistically significant asso- ciation fisher's exact test p  0.047. living environment appeared to be weakly associated with development of muo overall the odds of developing muo were lower for dogs living in a rural environment that for those living in urban areas although not significant at the p0.05 level or  2.810 p  0.067  and this was also reflected in the significant trend of odds associated with increasingly more populated environments kh2  4.53 p  0.033.multivariable analysis.

for none of these phyla was there evi- dence of a statistical difference in abundance between cases and controls  and condi- tional logistic regression analysis of the matched-pair data using tertiles as described above for prevotellaceae and f.prausnitzii did not support an association between abundance of any of these bacterial phyla and development of muo .finally we used principal component analysis as a means to detect more global association between fecal microbial content and development of muo.

doi .meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin muo is a common naturally-occurring clini- cal disease of pet dogs.

in this study we aimed to compare abun- dance of specific constituents of the fecal microbiota namely faecalibacterium prausnitzii and prevotellaceae between dogs diagnosed with muo and matched controls.

fecal sam- ples were obtained from 20 dogs diagnosed with muo and 20 control dogs matched for breed age and gender.

in this study we investigate possible etiologies for another canine disease meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin muo which models many aspects of multiple sclerosis in people.muo is an umbrella term used to summarize clinically-diagnosed immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the meninges spinal cord and especially the brain of dogs .

on histopathologic examination a variety of sub-types of muo are recognized differentiated mainly by the predominance of white or grey matter involvement the extent of necrosis and whether meninges are also inflamed  but all sub-types show the common feature of inflammatory cell infiltrate.

in common with multiple sclerosis ms  much effort has been directed toward searching for infectious causes for muo in dogs  and has proved similarly unsuccessful.traditionally experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae in rodents has been widely used as a model for investigating the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis .

in this study we exploited the well- known breed age and gender susceptibility  to design a case-control study in which to dis- sect the effects of gut microbial populations and other possible environmental triggers on development of muo in dogs.

final confirmation of the diag- nosis is achieved through post mortem examination but cases can usually be securely diag- nosed through clinical tests and long-term response to therapy alone.potential cases presented with various neurological signs relating to dysfunction of the brain we specifically excluded dogs that were suspected of having muo but had signs affect- ing the spinal cord or optic nerves alone underwent routine mri scanning and csf analysis.

any dog that had received oral antibiotics within 4 weeks of diagnosis or that was diagnosed with cancer or immune-mediated disease affecting any part of the body was also excluded.3t t2w axial mr image at the level of the caudal colliculus illustrating the typical hyperintensity  that is often prominent adjacent to the ventricles in cases of muo.
