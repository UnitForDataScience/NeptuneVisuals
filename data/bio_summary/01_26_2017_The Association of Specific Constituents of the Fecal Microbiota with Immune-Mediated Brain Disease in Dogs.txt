Prevotellaceae abundance is shown on a log scale to improve detail this is not possible for F.prausnitzii because many animals had a zero score.doi10.1371journal.pone.0170589.g002 Results of univariable conditional logistic regression analyzing association of various putative risk factors expressed as categories with the development of MUO.doi10.1371journal.pone.0170589.t001 Analysis of odds of development of MUO associated with various abundances of Prevotellaceae.Test of trend of odds kh2  6.65 P  0.010doi10.1371journal.pone.0170589.t002 Analysis of odds of development of MUO associated with various environmental conditions.Test of trend of odds kh2  4.53 P  0.033doi10.1371journal.pone.0170589.t003reflected in the significant trend of decreasing odds of developing MUO with increasing abun- dance of Prevotellaceae kh2  6.89 P  0.010 .We next examined the possible effects of two other possible environmental factors recent vaccination and home environment.

We hypothesized that in fecal samples obtained from dogs with MUO there would be a decreased abundance of F.prausnitzii and or Prevotellacea com- pared with that found in unaffected dogs.MethodsMaterials and methodsFecal samples were collected from dogs 'Cases' diagnosed with MUO at the veterinary hospi- tals of Iowa State University ISU and Texas AM University TAMU and stored in a -80C freezer for analysis at completion of case recruitment.

Typical cases of MUO present with signs of brain dysfunction such as seizures or brainstem dysfunction often disorders of vestibular function although signs of disease any- where in the CNS can be caused by MUO.

Living environment appeared to be weakly associated with development of MUO overall the odds of developing MUO were lower for dogs living in a rural environment that for those living in urban areas although not significant at the P0.05 level OR  2.810 P  0.067  and this was also reflected in the significant trend of odds associated with increasingly more populated environments kh2  4.53 P  0.033.Multivariable analysis.

For none of these phyla was there evi- dence of a statistical difference in abundance between Cases and Controls  and condi- tional logistic regression analysis of the matched-pair data using tertiles as described above for Prevotellaceae and F.prausnitzii did not support an association between abundance of any of these bacterial phyla and development of MUO .Finally we used principal component analysis as a means to detect more global association between fecal microbial content and development of MUO.

doi .Meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin MUO is a common naturally-occurring clini- cal disease of pet dogs.

In this study we aimed to compare abun- dance of specific constituents of the fecal microbiota namely Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Prevotellaceae between dogs diagnosed with MUO and matched controls.

Fecal sam- ples were obtained from 20 dogs diagnosed with MUO and 20 control dogs matched for breed age and gender.

In this study we investigate possible etiologies for another canine disease meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin MUO which models many aspects of multiple sclerosis in people.MUO is an umbrella term used to summarize clinically-diagnosed immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the meninges spinal cord and especially the brain of dogs .

On histopathologic examination a variety of sub-types of MUO are recognized differentiated mainly by the predominance of white or grey matter involvement the extent of necrosis and whether meninges are also inflamed  but all sub-types show the common feature of inflammatory cell infiltrate.
