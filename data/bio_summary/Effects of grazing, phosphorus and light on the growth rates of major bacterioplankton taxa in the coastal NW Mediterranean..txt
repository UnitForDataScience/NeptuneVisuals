Since bacterioplankton play major roles in ocean biogeochemical processes includ- ing organic matter utilization determining the growth rates of the bulk community as well as that of individual bacterioplankton species or groups is necessary to understand their contribution to energy and matter cycling.Bulk bacterial growth rates for the total community represent the average of a wide spectrum of organisms from cells that are almost inactive or dormant to cells growing very rapidly Del Giorgio and Gasol 2008 Campbell et al.

Nevertheless maximal growth rates of individual taxa can be much higher equivalent to generation times of a few days or hours Teira et al.

2009 Ferrera et al.

In a previous study we used manipulation experiments to determine the net and gross growth rates of different bacterioplankton groups at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory BBMO Northwestern Medi- terranean and examined the effects that top-down and bottom-up controls play in limiting growth Ferrera et al.

By using the dilution approach we were able to estimate the effect that overall resource availability has on determining the growth of different groups Ferrera et al.

It is well known that often the primary limit- ing resource in the Mediterranean is phosphorous P availability Thingstad et al.

1998 2005 Sala et al.

2002 Pinhassi et al.

Thus to determine the role of phosphorous on the growth rates of distinct bac- terial phylogenetic groups further experiments are required.Another important environmental factor that can mod-ulate growth is natural sunlight see review by Ruiz- Gonza'lez et al.

Considering that marine photoheterotrophic bacteria are more the rule than the exception in nature DeLong and Be'ja' 2010 PAR needs to be considered a relevant environmental factor controlling the dynamics of heterotrophic bacteria when building carbon flow models Gasol et al.
