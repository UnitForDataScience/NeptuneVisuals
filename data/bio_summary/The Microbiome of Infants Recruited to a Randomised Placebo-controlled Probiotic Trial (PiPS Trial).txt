NEC has a high associated mortality and morbidity and is the most common serious gastro-intestinal complication of prematurity with an incidence of between 6 to 10 in babies b 1500 g birthweight .Microbial diversity is characteristically reduced in infants at risk of developing NEC  leading to the proposition that the inflammatory response of the gut to an abnormal pattern of early microbial colonisation may underlie the pathogenesis of NEC Abbreviations AMR antimicrobial resistant NEC necrotizing enterocolitis NICU Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Additionally placebo controlled pro- biotic trials in infants have often omitted a comparison between the mi- crobial composition of the two groups and subsequently do not allow a full understanding of the impact if any of probiotic administration on the developing microbiome.The demonstration of intestinal dysbiosis following prolonged expo-sure to antimicrobials  and the associated in- creased risk of NEC  in preterm infants indicates a potential role for antimicrobial therapy in the modification of the microbiome and subsequent pathogenesis of NEC.

and reported that Proteobacteria were relatively dominant components of the microbiome especially Entero- bacteriaceae preceding the onset of NEC in preterm infants in cases of NEC compared with controls.

Despite differences in microbial composition in response to antibiotics in the present study the findings from this microbiome analysis of a subset of infants included in the PiPS trial and the outcomes of the trial itself neither refute nor support the hypothesis that NEC is a consequence of dysbiosis  .In conclusion the possibility that specific bacteria or microbial fac- tors play a protective role in determining the risk of NEC remainsTable 2Statistical output for models fitting primary exposure of total number of days on antibi- otics from day 0 to day 14.ModelNOdds ratio 95 CIP-valueAgresti A.

This increased to 19 when adjusted for mode of delivery NEC and birthweight per 100 g. Days on antibiotics was highly statistically significant in all models.DiscussionThe microbiome of the gut of preterm infants has consistently been shown to have higher proportions of Proteobacteria compared to those of full term infants .

The early pat- tern of development of the microbiome in infants nursed in intensive care has been linked with serious consequences including the develop- ment of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis NEC  .

The final models for both comparisons adjusted for mode of delivery cae- sarean section or vaginal NEC and birthweight per 100 g. The results for models fitting the primary exposure of total number of days on an- tibiotics from day 0 to day 14 are shown in .The odds of a baby being colonised by a microbiome from group b compared to group c decreased by 16 for every one day increase in the total number of days on antibiotics between days 0 and 14.

The use of probiotics has been postulated to represent a means by which the microbiome of the preterm infant may be altered such that it confers a protective effect against NEC.
