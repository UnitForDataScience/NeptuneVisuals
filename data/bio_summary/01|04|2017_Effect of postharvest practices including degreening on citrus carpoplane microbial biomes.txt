2003 with tem- peratures varying according to region.Notwithstanding its advantages in improving fruit visual appearances studies have shown that ethylene degreening can result in increased postharvest fruit decay of citrus fruit Smilanick et al.

Fruit samples were collected from the same batch moving through commercial postharvest practices including har- vesting bins prior to fungicide drenching freshly com- mercially harvested drenched fruit prior to degreening drenched and degreened fruit before chlorine treatment degreened with ethylene.

2004.Our results support the concept that drenching fruit prior to degreening reduces microbial loads on fruit sur- faces Smilanick et al.

A close examination of the microbiota of fruit and the impact of intervention strategies on the ecological balance may provide a more durable approach to reduce losses and spoilage.IntroductionThe carpoplane fruit surface is colonized by a variety of micro-organisms that include several species of bacteria fungi and yeasts Abdelfattah et al.

The epiphytic microbiota on plant surfaces adapts differently to different environmental conditions due to fitness within the community context Brandl 2006.Although no change was observed in microbial popula- tions of untreated Palmer navels held under ambient con- ditions for 3 days it is still recommended to promptly wash and disinfect fruit after harvest as microbial popula- tions can increase as was seen with Clementine fruit.

Ten fungal genera dominated the orange surfaces including some important groups such as Davidiella Cryptococcus Penicillium Epicoccum and Sporobolomyces.The genus Davidiella was the most dominant at all pro- cessing stages with similar proportions observed in freshly harvested drenched and untreated fruit but relatively less on degreened fruit.

Beginning with freshly harvested fruit fungal diversity declined significantly after drenching but had little effect on bacteria and populations recovered during degreening treatments including those for Penicillium sp.Conclusion Packhouse processing greatly influences microbial communities on the citrus carpoplane.Significance and Impact of the Study A broad orange biome was described with pyrosequencing and gave insight into the likely survival and persistence of pathogens especially as they may affect the quality and safety of the packed product.

To meet consumers' expectations of the 'perfect orange' degreening of oranges is used as a postharvest treatment to hasten the natural colour break of earlyseasonal fruit Smilanick et al.
