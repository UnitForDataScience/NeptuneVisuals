diffocins produced by C. difficile to kill competing C. difficile strains 13.

Av-CD291.2 had a modified killing spectrum that included all hypervirulent RT027 C. difficile strains tested blocked C. difficile colonization in a mouse model of spore transmission and did not disrupt the resident gut microbiota 12.

If such a cocktail of Avidocin-CDs were to be administered a point of care diagnostic would only need to detect the presence of C. difficile to guide treatment decisions.The strong selective pressure afforded by Av-CD291.2 allowed isolation of the first spontaneous C. difficile S-layer null mutants.

We recently described the prototypic Avidocin- CD Av-CD291.2 that specifically kills C. difficile ribotype 027 strains and prevents colonization of mice.

Using newly identified phage RBPs we constructed a panel of new Avidocin-CDs that kill C. difficile isolates in an SLCT-dependent manner confirming the S-layer as the receptor in every case.

Avidocin-CDs have significant therapeutic potential for the treatment and prevention of C. difficile Infection CDI given their exquisite specificity for the pathogen.To whom correspondence should be addressed Gregory R. Govoni ggovonsgmail.com Robert P. FagAuthor contributionsD.S.

One pathogen for which alternative treatment approaches are needed is C. difficile.

As a result the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified C. difficile as an urgent threat to human health 5.

Although the toxins have been studied in great detail other aspects of C. difficile virulence including colonization of the gut are not well understood 6.

The C. difficile cell surface is covered by a paracrystalline surface layer S- layer largely comprised of SlpA and sparsely interspersed by 28 related cell wall proteins 7.
