in this study we determined whether ja signalling influences the diversity and functioning of the wheat triticum aestivum microbiome and whether these effects are specific to particular parts of the plant.

our findings indicate that the effects of ja signalling on the wheat microbiome are specific to individual plant compartments.pmid 28134326 pmcid doi images from this publication.figure 1the effect of meja application on the transcription of genes associated with the jasmonic acid ja signalling pathway in 10-day-old wheat seedlings.asterisks indicate significant differences between control and meja treated plants p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 two-tailed student's t test.
