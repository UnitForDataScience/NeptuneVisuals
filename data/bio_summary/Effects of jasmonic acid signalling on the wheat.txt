In this study we determined whether JA signalling influences the diversity and functioning of the wheat Triticum aestivum microbiome and whether these effects are specific to particular parts of the plant.

Phylogenetic marker gene sequencing revealed that JA signalling reduced the diversity and changed the composition of root endophytic but not shoot endophytic or rhizosphere bacterial communities.

The total enzymatic activity and substrate utilisation profiles of rhizosphere bacterial communities were not affected by JA signalling.
