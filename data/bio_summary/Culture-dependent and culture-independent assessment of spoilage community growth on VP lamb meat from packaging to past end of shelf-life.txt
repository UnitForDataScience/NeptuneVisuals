The mean total viable counts TVC and lactic acid bacterial viable counts LAB were observed to increase to log 7.5 CFUcm2 and 7 CFUcm2 after 6 and 42 days at 8 oC and -1.2 oC and stayed stable until shelf-life termination after 13 and 124 days respectively.

The sequence data showed initial communities were patchily distributed and were mainly derived from skin microbiome taxa likely prevalent within the abattoir.

The combination of negligible O2 levels elevated CO2 meat pH chill storage and po- tential antimicrobial activities of microbes that grow under VP conditions  synergistically interact to dictate meat stability.

The storage life for chilled VP lamb meat is shorter than VP beef approximately 12 weeks at 0.3 oC .

The research described here determined the spoilage dynamics of bacteria on VP lamb meat at temperatures that represent the limits of commercially feasible chilling -1 oC and an elevated temperature 8 oC that is indicative of failure of effective refrigeration within a supply chain.

The lamb cut exam- ined here included bone-in hind shank which can be considered to potentially have a more variable shelf-life than bone-less primals due to uneven bone sections potentially causing problems with VPbag sealing as well as potentially greater microbial loads due to being located at the rear of the carcass.

The main questions that we wanted to answer in the study included i what particular mi- crobial species predominate on VP lamb meat under different temperatures and how variable is this association ii how do initial bacterial populations on meat surfaces derived from exposure to the abattoir environment associate with resultant spoilage and iii determine how growth dynamics of SSO vary from the packaging step to product spoilage and how this relates back to the initial bacterial colonisation process in the abattoir.

The five samples collected at the point of packaging time 0 were common for both storage temperatures.Microbiological and sensory analysesFor each time point of sampling 5 replicates except at last three time points of storage at -1.2 oC where the numbers of replicates were either 3 or 4 were analysed.

The colour and odour were observed twice i.e.

The meat surface pH was measured using a digital pH meter ORION model 250A.
