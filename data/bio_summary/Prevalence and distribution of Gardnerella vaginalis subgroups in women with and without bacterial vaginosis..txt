multiple strains of g. vaginalis from 3 to15 were thus isolated from each swab specifically 13 isolates per swab for clade 1 9 for clade 2 15 for clade 4 and none from clade 3. when classified by bv status13 g. vaginalis strains were isolated from bv-positive vaginal samples 8 strains from partial bv samples and 4 strains from bv-negative samples.

an earlier study in the usa detected clade 3 in 31.7 of the 60 samples studied and showed its as- sociation with bv-type flora while we found no clade 3 g. vaginalis strains among the isolates strains of subgroup d corresponding to clade 3 were isolated from specimens that originated from canada n  1 and kenya n  7  clade 4 the most frequently found clade showed no association with bv an observation that is in agreement with previous results our find- ing that g. vaginalis strains of clade 1 were more likely to colonize bv-positive women p  0.010 was consistent with the previous finding by balashov and colleagues .

vaginalis isolates of an unknown cladesome of the strains isolated from samples 060s1 086s1 099s1 and 108s1 did not belong to any clade detectable by clade-specific pcr although all of them were identi- fied as g. vaginalis by both their characteristic microbio- logical profile and the nucleotide sequence of their 16s rrna coding gene rdp clade-specific pcr identified four clades in vaginal sam- ple 099s1 additional file but found none from known clades in three g. vaginalis isolates from the cor- responding swab table sample 060s1 ns 10 clade 2  clade 4 yielded 15 independent isolates 11 from clade 2 and 4 that did not belong to any of the four known clades.

the differences in g. vaginalis detection observed for various pcr primers demonstrate that the low preva- lence of g. vaginalis reported in bv-negative women might depend not only on the patient's cohorts or geo- graphicalethnic origin but also on the target sequences selected for pcr.subtyping of the g. vaginalis present in noncultured vaginal samples by qualitative clade-specific pcr  demonstrated a significant association between multi- clade g. vaginalis communities and ns  4. this agrees with the findings of a recent study which suggested that the presence of multiple clades was a result of un- protected sex with new partners.

subtyping of g. vaginalis in vaginal samples demonstrated that multi-clade g. vaginalis communities were more common in vaginal samples with ns  4. detection of clade 1 and clade 2 was associated with ns 7-10 but there was no association of either clade 3 or clade 4 with high nugent scores.

clade 4 was most frequently detected 79.4 followed by clade 1 63.7 clade 2 42.2 and clade 3 15.7. multi-clade g. vaginalis communities showed a positive association with nugent score ns  4 or 3.64 95 ci 1.48-8.91 p  0.005. clade 1 and clade 2 were statistically significantly more common in samples with ns 7-10 or 4.69 95 ci 1.38-15.88 p  0.01 and or 6.

clade 2 was detected only in multi-clade communities with one exception sample 093s1 ns 2. clade 4 was the most frequently detected 79.4followed by clade 1 63.7 clade 2 42.2 and clade 3 15.7. multi-clade g. vaginalis communities were positively associated with ns 4 or 3.64 95 ci 1.48-8.91 p  0.005.the prevalence of each of the four g. vaginalis clades showed a distinct association with bv status.

however quantifi- cation of microbial loads in the vaginal samples mightreveal a synergistic relationship between bv-associated bacteria and vaginal mollicutes g. vaginalis was found to be prevalent in women with- out bv an observation in agreement with data from sev- eral patient cohorts in the usa likewise the lack of specificity of cpn60 pcr as a test for g. vaginalis observed agrees with an earlier report however we did not find an association between false-negative results from cpn60 pcr or 23s rrna pcr and particular g. vaginalis clades either individually or in combination.

overall the clade assignments of these isolated strains matched the clades identified in that sample by pcr with two exceptions i clade 1 was detected in the noncultured vaginal sample 070s1 but the four isolates originated from the corresponding vaginal swab were clade 2 ii one of seven g. vaginalis isolates from sample 058s2 was clade 2 - a clade not detected in the corresponding noncultured vaginal sample.g.

results for the inter- assay agreement are shown in additional file the agreement between vly pcr and 16s rrna pcr was moderate kappa  0.55 whereas that between vly pcr and 23s rrna pcr was fair kappa  0.23. in addition the g. vaginalis subgroups clades present were identi- fied in 75 of the 91 82.4 vaginal samples by clade- specific pcr assays see below.g.

the most ubiquitous clade clade 4 showed no association or 1.31 95 ci 0.39-4.41 p  0.767 with bv ns 7-10 whereas clade 2 was the group most frequently observed in samples from women with both high ns 7-10 and three amsel criteria or 6.26 95 ci 2.20-17.81 p  0.001. clade 1showed a positive association with vaginal flora charac- terized by ns 7-10 or 4.69 95 ci 1.38-15.88p  0.010 but was also found in 61.5 and 57.1 of partial bv and bv-negative samples respectively fig.

differ- ences between groups were evaluated by two-tailed fisher's exact test with a significance level of p  0.05 using graphpad prism 6.resultscharacterization of vaginal samplesto assess the distribution of g. vaginalis subgroups in women with either healthy or disturbed vaginal micro- flora the state of every vaginal sample was characterized using both the nugent method  and amsel criteria ten samples were excluded from further analysis due to contradictory classifications by amsel criteria and nugent scoring that indicated vaginal flora alterations other than fully developed bv or partial bv to characterize the vaginal microflora of healthy and bv-affected women the presence of pertinent bacterial species was detected by pcr assays and of candida by culture while pathogens associated with seven sexually transmitted infections were detected by qpcr.of the 119 characterized vaginal samples 29 24.4 were classified as bv positive ns 7-10. those samples were found by pcr to also be positive for bacteria characteristic of bv fig.

however the results of clade-specific pcr of isolated g. vaginalis strains from four vaginal samples did not match any known type even though they demonstrated a specific genetic profile table combined these results suggest the possible existence of more than four g. vaginalis subgroups.conclusionsthis study analysed the relevance of g. vaginalis geno- typing approach based on the detection of clade-specific genes to various clinical conditions in the vagina.

the 35 clade 4 strains tested that had been derived from 15 samples with varied ns were all negative for sld whereas g. vagi- nalis atcc 14019 and strains of clade 1 n  13 and clade 2 n  12 were positive.g.

indeed the prevalence of polyclonal g. vaginalis communities in the vaginal milieu once again raises the question of the mode of bv acquisition .within the vaginal samples with single clade commu- nities n  31 clade 4 n  19 and clade 1 n  9 were most prevalent regardless of the bv status.
