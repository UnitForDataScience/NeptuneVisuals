This 5mg dose is 60 lower than the 12.5 mg in currently used MNPs yet the improvements in Hb 5-9gL and reductions in anaemia -30-50 compare favourably with those reported for12.5 mg iron MNPs.Previous intervention studies of the effect of iron on the infant and child microbiome are limited.In a controlled trial in 6-month-old Kenyan infants iron-containing MNPs increased the EnterobacteriaceaeBifidobacteriaceae ratio and numbers of enteropathogenic E. coli.In contrast in 6-month-old Malawian infants randomised to no interven- tion or dietary supplements providing 5.5-6.0 mg ironday there were no significant differences in the gut microbiota after 12 months.In a controlled trial in Ivorian school- aged children receiving iron-fortified biscuits 9 mg iron day iron increased Enterobacteriaceae and decreased Lacto- bacillaceae.In contrast in South African school-aged chil- dren from an area with better hygiene iron supplements50 mgday 4 daysweek caused no discernible effects on the gut microbiota.The varied findings from these studies are likely due to age-related differences in the gut microbiota between infants and older children differences in methods used to characterise the gut microbiome differences in geographical setting and hygiene andor the iron compound and dose given.In our study addition of GOS to an iron-containing MNP counterbalanced the effects of iron after 4 months of the inter- vention in the Fe group there were lower relative abundances of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae and higher relative abundances of Clostridiales compared with the control and FeGOS groups in contrast there were no significant differences in these taxa comparing the FeGOS group with the control group F. We chose a GOS dose of 7.5 gday based on studies that reported a bifidogenic effect in infants and adults at this dose and because this is the typical daily dose delivered by GOS-containing commercial infant formulas.The enhance- ment of commensal bacteria strengthens the barrier effect against enteropathogen growth commensal bacteria occupy more microbiological niches compete for nutrients increase secre- tory IgA and reduce pathogen adhesion site.The suppres- sive effect on enteropathogens was visible in our data during the intervention the FeGOS group had lower abundances of the VTGs of all pathogens  and the VTGs of pathogenicE.

For 199 infants we received informed consent and we enrolled them into a 2-week run-in period without MNPs to familiarise the infants and caregivers with preparation and consumption of the maize porridge 171 infants completed the 2-week run-in period and were invited for the complete base- line screening.

Iron-containing micronutrient powders MNPs added to complementary foods effectively reduce IDA in infants a strategy described as 'in-homefortification'.However current MNPs contain a high iron dose 12.5 mg that is equivalent to the dose provided by oral iron supplements for the treatment of IDA in infancy.The safety of these MNPs is uncertainas recent MNP trials 12.5 mg ironday in infants reported increases in diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections RTIs.

Iron is a growth-limiting nutrient for many gut bacteriaand for most enteric Gram-negative bacteria eg Salmonella pathogenic Escherichia coli iron acquisition is essential for virulence and colonisation.In contrast lactobacilli and bifidobacteria can improve gut integrity and reduce colonisation by enteric patho- gensbut lactobacilli require no ironand some Bifidobac- terium spp can efficiently sequester iron limiting its availability to pathogens.Large increases in colonic iron could favour pathogen growth especially in African infants in areas of poor hygiene who have high carriage rates of pathogens.In a trial in Kenyan infants MNPs increased the EnterobacteriaceaeBi- fidobacteriaceae ratio numbers of enteropathogenic E. coli gut inflammation and diarrhoea.Thus safer MNP formulations are needed.

Based on previous studies in African infants and childrenwe estimated a sample size of 35 infants in each group would be sufficient to detect a difference of approximately 0.85 log number of copiesg faeces in Lacto- bacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae considering an SD of 1.25 in log abundance with a0.05 and b0.8.

We considered p values 0.05 as statistically significant.resultsDuring the intervention 10 infants dropped out  and the final analysis was completed on 145 infants control group n48 Fe group n49 and FeGOS group n48.

At baseline all infants were still partially breast fed except one infant in the Fe group and all were already receiving comple- mentary foods mainly maize porridge 97 of infants were still partially breast fed at endpoint.

p value expresses the significant time effect of a generalised linear model with infants treated for RTI as response variable time as fixed factor and subject as a random effect.Fe group were treated for a RTI during the intervention n45 87 of all infants compared with the control group n38 75 p0.024 and compared with the FeGOS group n39 75 trend p0.098.

Damaged enterocytes release I-FABP into the bloodstream it is a sensitive marker for enterocyte injury and can be combined with faecal calprotectin to assess disease severity.I-FABP in our infants at baseline was higher than in European children with sepsisand high plasma I-FABP in African infants may reflect enterocyte injury due to common enteric infections.In our study at 4 months I-FABP was higher in the Fe group than in the control group while there was no significant difference comparing the FeGOS group with control  suggesting the addition of GOS may have reduced Fe-mediated enterocyte damage this effect may be mediated through changes in gut microbiotaandor iron-induced oxida- tive stress to enterocytes.Compared with the Fe group there was a lower incidence of RTIs in the FeGOS group and a decrease in RTIs in the FeGOS group over the 4-month intervention  but no group differences in diarrhoea.

Expert groups have judged prebiotics to be safe and well tolerated in infants however nearly all previous studies were done in infants from high-income countries with good hygiene.
