nevertheless history has confirmed that the widespread use of even new antibiotics is ultimately followed by the appearance of resistance to those drugs creating issues at a global scale.

some of these pathogens have been shown to be extremely resistant to all antibiotics commonly used or are capable of rapidly develop resistance when exposed to antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment.

it is therefore not surprising to see that as a result of the indiscriminate use and abuse of antibiotics the incidence of some foodborne pathogens such as salmonella and campylobacter are increasing worldwide with reports of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of these and other enteric pathogens -.

the idea is more appli- cable now than ever since bacterial antimicrobial resistance has become a serious worldwide problem both in medical and agricultural fields.

bacteria are equipped with the biological mechanisms to evolve and find mechanisms of resistance against any chemical.

hence antibiotic alterna- tives such as probiotics prebiotics phytochemicals enzymes organic acids and vaccines to improve disease resistance in highly intensestress food animal production systems have become a priority for many scientists around the world  .
