Nevertheless history has confirmed that the widespread use of even new antibiotics is ultimately followed by the appearance of resistance to those drugs creating issues at a global scale.

Some of these pathogens have been shown to be extremely resistant to all antibiotics commonly used or are capable of rapidly develop resistance when exposed to antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment.

It is therefore not surprising to see that as a result of the indiscriminate use and abuse of antibiotics the incidence of some foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter are increasing worldwide with reports of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of these and other enteric pathogens -.

The idea is more appli- cable now than ever since bacterial antimicrobial resistance has become a serious worldwide problem both in medical and agricultural fields.

The nonantibiotic anti-inflammatory effect of antimicrobial growth promoters the real mode of action A hypothesis.

As a result several methods to control foodborne pathogens have been implemented including the use of antibiotics.

In recent years substantial scientific evidence has shown that the use of certain antibiotics increases enteric colonization of antibiotic-resistant strains of enteric pathogens not only in humans but also in domestic animals  .

Equally frighteningly is the fact that indiscriminate use of antibiotics can actually induce disruption of the intestinal microbiome   reducing the production of short chain fatty acids  and increasing luminal pH in the distal gastrointestinal tract .

Consequently the World Health Organization WHO published a list of antibiotics that should be reserved for human use only .

Interestingly soon after the publication of the WHO report and with growing consumer and scientific pressures the European Union went one step further creating new legislations banning the use of all antibiotics as growth promoters as of January 2006 -.
