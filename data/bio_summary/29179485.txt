Then 104 patients were included in the final analysis Table 1 consisting of 33 patients with UC and 71 patients with CD.

Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and economic value of FMT for the treatment of IBD in China.RESULTSPatient characteristicsA total of 222 patients with moderate to severe IBD underwent FMT in this study and 118 patients were excluded according to the exclusion criteria.

The proportion of patients with a bachelor degree or above was 47.1 49104.EffectivenessIn this study we analyzed the changes on treatment strategies for IBD patients during one year before and after FMT.

Moreover this study showed that switching from previous medication therapy to FMT could effectively improve the patients' life quality and relieve the patients' economic burden.In this study as for the medical treatments for IBD 5-ASA was used as the dominated maintenance drug both during one year before and after FMT.

104 patients with IBD received FMT were recruited.

Moreover younger patients  24 females non-smokers and Crohn's disease CD achieved more benefits.

However the huge financial burden and the limited clinical response are still primary challenges to patients.

Researchers and physicians have never stopped to explore the novel therapies with cost-effectiveness for improving patients' life quality.Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT as a new strategy to treat gut dysbiosis has showed its potential therapeutic role in IBD 5-16.

Given new treatment strategies and drugs might bring a better clinical efficacy but with a larger economic burden to the patients we should take the economic value of them into serious consideration.

The high cost of IBD is driven especially by biological therapy and surgery and FMT as an alternative therapy might be able to reduce the economic burden on patients and society.
