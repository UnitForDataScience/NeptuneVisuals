The capability of E. coli ATCC25922 and Salmonella 6547E strains to be associated to the Caco-2 cells in the presenceand absence of probiotic strains as well as in the presence of probiotic combination were tested.

The results showed that the number of viable cells administered in milk after 90 min was similar to that at the beginning of the experiment in all probiotic strains indicating that all strains were resistant to acidic conditions.

The lowest survival rate showed BGHI14 0.01 tilog CFUml 4.2 when administered in milk and 0.001 tilog CFUml 4.9 when administered in saline .Characterization of Technological Properties of the Strains and Preparation of Fermented ProbioticSince the results of in vitro GIT survival showed that the best survival rate of the strains was obtained in milk the strains S. thermophilus BGVLJ1-44 L. fermentum BGHI14 and L. helveticus BGRA43 were used as starter cultures for preparation of fermented dairy probiotic.

The obtained results suggested that all three strains could adequately survive the passage through stomach while only two strains BGRA43 and BGVLJ1-44 survived the passage through dudenum from initial 108 CFUml to 107 CFUml after incubation in gastric juice and bile salts approximately 10 survival.

To determine the capability of probiotic strains to decrease the association of E. coli ATCC25922 and Salmonella 6547E strains to Caco-2 monolayers data were referred to that obtained with the E. coli ATCC25922 and Salmonella 6547E strains alone respectively i.e.

The strains BGVLJ1-44 and BGRA43 showed good technological properties fast milk curdling strong proteolytic activity.

The strains were grown at 37C in anaerobic condition using Anaerocult A Merck.

The level of as1- b- and k- casein degradation was quantified by ImageQuant software Molecular Dynamics GmbH Krefeld Germany.Survival of the Strains in Simulated Gastrointestinal Tract TransitSurvival of probiotic strains after the chemically simulated gastrointestinal tract GIT transit was essentially performed as described previously   with minor modifications.

The strains were grown in appropriate medium for 24 h and cultures were harvested by centrifugation 10000 g for 10 min washed twice with 0.85 NaCl and concentrated 10-times in reconstituted 10 sterilized skimmed-milk Difco Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ United States or in saline buffer 0.85 NaCl.

The colonocyte-like cell line Caco-2 was used to determine the adhesion ability of bacterial strains.
