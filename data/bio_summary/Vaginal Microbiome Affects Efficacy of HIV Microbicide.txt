to determine the capability of probiotic strains to decrease the association of e. coli atcc25922 and salmonella 6547e strains to caco-2 monolayers data were referred to that obtained with the e. coli atcc25922 and salmonella 6547e strains alone respectively i.e.

the lowest survival rate showed bghi14 0.01 tilog cfuml 4.2 when administered in milk and 0.001 tilog cfuml 4.9 when administered in saline .characterization of technological properties of the strains and preparation of fermented probioticsince the results of in vitro git survival showed that the best survival rate of the strains was obtained in milk the strains s. thermophilus bgvlj1-44 l. fermentum bghi14 and l. helveticus bgra43 were used as starter cultures for preparation of fermented dairy probiotic.

after 21 days ofstorage of the fermented milk and whey the number of probiotic bacteria in fermented milk and whey was 8.2 log cfuml and 7.9 log cfuml respectively .characterization of the ability of probiotic strains to reduce the e. coli and salmonella adhesion to caco-2 cellsin order to determine the ability of the strains s. thermophilusbgvlj1-44 l. fermentum bghi14 and l. helveticus bgra43 tocounteract the adhesion of pathogens the adhesion properties of the probiotic strains to iec caco-2 were determined.

both lactobacilli strains bgra43 and bghi14 p  0.05 as well as probiotic combination p  0.01 significantly reduced the adhesion of escherichia coli atcc25922 to caco-2 cells while the strains bgvlj1-44 p  0.01 and bgra43 p  0.05 significantly reduced adhesion of salmonella 6547e veterinary isolate.

the level of as1- b- and k- casein degradation was quantified by imagequant software molecular dynamics gmbh krefeld germany.survival of the strains in simulated gastrointestinal tract transitsurvival of probiotic strains after the chemically simulated gastrointestinal tract git transit was essentially performed as described previously   with minor modifications.

experiments were carried out in two replicated plates and in each plate three wells were used per sample.reduction of e. coli atcc25922 and salmonella 6547e adhesion to caco-2 cells in presence of the strainsthe reduction of adhesion of e. coli atcc25922 and salmonella 6547e strains in the presence of probiotic strains was tested on caco-2 cells as described previously  .

the capability of e. coli atcc25922 and salmonella 6547e strains to be associated to the caco-2 cells in the presenceand absence of probiotic strains as well as in the presence of probiotic combination were tested.

the results showed that the number of viable cells administered in milk after 90 min was similar to that at the beginning of the experiment in all probiotic strains indicating that all strains were resistant to acidic conditions.

interestingly there was no reduction of salmonella 6547e adhesion in the presence of bghi14 and probiotic mixture.in vivo evaluation of the effect of probiotic combination on neonatal pigletssince the results given in section in vitro git survival of probiotic strains showed that the number of probiotic bacteria was higher in fermented milk than in whey the fermented milk containing probiotic strains l. fermentum bghi14 l. helveticus bgra43 and s. thermophilus bgvlj1-44 was used in farm trial.farm trialin order to determine possible protective effect of the mixed probiotic culture on neonatal piglets the farm trial was performed including 50 pregnant sows 25 sows treated with probiotic combination and 25 control sows.

the obtained results suggested that all three strains could adequately survive the passage through stomach while only two strains bgra43 and bgvlj1-44 survived the passage through dudenum from initial 108 cfuml to 107 cfuml after incubation in gastric juice and bile salts approximately 10 survival.

here we report that the strains used in this study have moderate adhesion ability 7-15 enabling the strains to colonize the intestinal mucosa.

interestingly the adhesion of salmonella 6547e in the presence of mixed probiotic culture was not reduced indicating that possible antagonistic effects among the strains in probiotic mixture could be assumed.further in this study we have treated the sows in the period of 10 days before the farrowing and the results revealed that the probiotic successfully reduced the number of viable cells of enterobacteriaceae in litters of probiotic treated sows confirming the results obtained in in vitro experiments showing ability of the probiotic strains to reduce association of e. coli and salmonella to caco-2 cells.

mixed probiotic starter culture is composed of three thermophilic lactic acid bacteria lab strains lactobacillus helveticus bgra43 lactobacillus fermentum bghi14 and streptococcus thermophilus bgvlj1-44.

the strains bgvlj1-44 and bgra43 showed good technological properties fast milk curdling strong proteolytic activity.

in addition the strain bgvlj1-44 produces exopolysaccharide eps bghi14 is heterofermentative lab strain with significant immunomodulatory effect while the strain bgra43 showed strong antimicrobial activity against different pathogens and exhibited significantly higher level of adhesion to caco-2 cells comparing to other two strains.
