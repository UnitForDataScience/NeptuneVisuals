Recently intestinal organoids were used to visualize the short-range Wnt gradient in the intestinal stem cell niche17.Paneth cells are important players in the intestinal stem cell niche but they are identified as nonessential constituents.

It has been speculated that the lipid-associated exocytosis is an additive mechanism to the chemosensory system of FFARs and enteroendocrine cells to perform synergisms between the intestinal microbiome and host metabolism.The release of AMPs from Paneth cells into the intestinal mucus and lumen is initiated by stimulation of pattern recognition receptors PRRs located on intestinal surfaces.

The important role of Paneth cells in intestinal physiology and pathophysiology strongly supports the view that these cells are the guardian of small intestinal crypts.REFERENCESSancho E Batlle E Clevers H. Live and let die in the intestinal epithelium.

Some other epithelial and non-epithelial cell types are found at the mucosal surface including M-cells brushtuftcaveolated cells and several types of intraepithelial lymphocytes.Enterocytes are most common in the surface epith- elium and are responsible for digestion and absorption of nutrients as well as in forming the intestinal border.Figure 1 Normal small intestinal crypts with basal orientated Paneth cells.

Consequently Paneth cell disorders are involved in the pathophysiology of intestinal diseases.They are assisted by mucosecretinggoblet cells which producing several mucine types which are chemically different along the intestinal tract.

A detailed classification of enteroendocrine subtypes is possible by the specific intestinal hormones that are produced and the assistance of Notch signalling in enteroendocrine cell differentiation23.Paneth cells first described by Gustav Albert Schwalbe in 1872 originate directly from intestinal stem cells4.

The intestinal epithelia descend from a distinct stem cell zone located in small intestinal crypts.

The zone consists of Paneth cells and 4 to 6 independent intestinal adult stem cells adjacent to rapidly cycling progenitors in the upper part of intestinal crypts.The stem zone model is orientated on the morp- hological finding of crypt base columnar cells CBC cells.

Using a different strategy of intestinal Math1 deficiency functional intestinal stem cells were found after Paneth cell ablation19.
