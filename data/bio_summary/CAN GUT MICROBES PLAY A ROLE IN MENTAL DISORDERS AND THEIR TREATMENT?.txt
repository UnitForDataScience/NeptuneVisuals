The subtitle The rich array of microbiota in our intestines can tell us more than you might think.

The quoted question is in fact the title of a full-scale review by P.A.

The US National Institute of Mental Health is inviting grant applications to study basic mechanisms of gut-brain interactions.In summary this line of research has captured the interest of the scientific community and the public in the US and elsewhere.

The microbiota in the adult human gut consist of approxi- mately 1kg of bacteria viruses protozoa fungi and archaea.

The immune system transduces the effects of microbiota on the brain.On the other hand germ-free GF mice have an overactive response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adre- nal axis HPA to stress Sudo et al.

The exaggerated HPA stress response by GF mice was reversed by treatment with Bifidobacterium infantis.

The response was reversed by a probiotic suggesting a role of microbiota in the modulation of stress response.Stress results in an alteration of gut barrier function.

The immune system responds by a pro-inflammatory reaction generating high levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins IL-1 and IL-6 Dinan et al.

The probiotic tested in such trial should aim at correcting those differences.
