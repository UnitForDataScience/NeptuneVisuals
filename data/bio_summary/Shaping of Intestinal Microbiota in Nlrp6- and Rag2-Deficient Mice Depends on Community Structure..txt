However upon reintroduction of a dys- biotic community into isobiotic WT Nlrp6-- and Rag2-- mice distinct differences in the composition of the metabolically active microbiota became detectable suggesting that Nlrp6 and adaptive immunity specifically contribute to the regulation of mi- crobiota composition in the presence of microbes with proin- flammatory features.RESULTSFamilial Transmission Significantly Influences Microbiota Composition in Conventionally Housed Nlrp6 Inflammasome-Deficient MiceUsing a cross-sectional study of distinct lines of WT and gene- deficient mice we previously identified an altered microbial community in Nlrp6 inflammasome-deficient mice  .

Environmental Factors Contribute to Diverse Microbiota Composition in Nlrp6 Inflammasome-Deficient MiceScheme for cross-sectional characterization of fecal microbiota composition in WT Nlrp6-- Asc-- and Casp111-- mice maintained by inbreeding in conventional housing conditions.NMDS ordination analysis of microbiota composition in mice using Bray-Curtis distances grouped by genotype.Individual effect size of tested covariates.D-F NMDS ordination analysis of microbiota composition in Nlrp6-- D Asc-- E and Casp111-- F mice using Bray-Curtis distances grouped by colony.

Prevotellaceae which we previ- ously identified to be enriched in Nlrp6-- mice   had the highest abundance in Nlrp6-- mice compared to WT Asc-- and Casp111-- mice G but significant differences were observed in colonies of Nlrp6-- mice  H p  0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test.

Increased Abundance of Distinct Bacteria in Distal Colon of eSPFConv-Dys Nlrp6-- and Rag2-- MiceRNA-based microbiome analysis in the proximal colon PC and distal colon DC of two cohorts of eSPF WT Nlrp6-- and Rag2-- mice 4 weeks after receiving independent FT from Conv-Dys Nlrp6-- mice.

Hence in general distinct community structures and particularly exposure to specific pathobionts are likely required to cause imbalances in the microbiota as their development depends on specific interactions between com- mensals pathobionts and the host immune system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMouse Lines Housing Conditions and RederivationThe generation of Nlrp3tm1Flv Nlrp3-- Nlrp6tm1Flv Nlrp6-- B6.129- Nlrp3tm1Flv-Nlrp6tm1Flv Nlrp3--Nlrp6-- Pycardtm1Flv Asc-- Casp1tm2Flv Casp1-- Casp4tm1aKOMPWtsi Casp11-- Casp1tm1Flv Casp111-- ll1btm1Yiw Il1b-- ll1atm1Yiw Il1a-- Ighmtm1Cgn muMT-- Tcrbtm1MomTcrdtm1Mom Tcrb--Tcrd-- and Rag2tm1Fwa Rag2-- has been previously described.Colonies of conventionally housed WT Nlrp6-- Asc-- Casp111-- and Rag2-- mice on a C57BL6N background were bred and maintained within one large animal facility using standard housing conditions i.e.

Along these lines a recent study has challenged the pro- posed role of the Nlrp6 inflammasome in shaping the micro- biome claiming that a generalizable impact of this Nlrp6 was not detectable upon rederivation of these mice into specific pathogen-free SPF conditions .

Therefore we introduced the microbiota of conventionally housed dysbiotic Nlrp6-- mice Conv-Dys  into eSPF WT Rag2-- and Nlrp6-- mice through fecal transplantation FT A.

Since Nlrp6 has been proposed to specifically modulate the mucosal barrier  we next investigated the microbiota composition in the intestinal lumen or the mucus layer of Nlrp6-- and Rag2-- mice.

This demonstrates that upon exposure to pathobiont-containing communities de- ficiencies in adaptive immune cells have a broad impact on mi- crobiota composition while deficiency in Nlrp6 has a rather distinctive but readily detectable influence on the metabolically active communities in the colon.Increased Abundance of Pathobionts in Mice Deficient of Nlrp6 and Adaptive ImmunityWe next explored the taxonomic composition of the bacteria which differs between genotypes in the lumen of the colon.

WT B6N Nlrp6-- N6 and Rag2-- Rag2 mice bred in eSPF conditions were subjected to a fecal transplantation FT from conventionally housed Nlrp6-- mice.
