however upon reintroduction of a dys- biotic community into isobiotic wt nlrp6-- and rag2-- mice distinct differences in the composition of the metabolically active microbiota became detectable suggesting that nlrp6 and adaptive immunity specifically contribute to the regulation of mi- crobiota composition in the presence of microbes with proin- flammatory features.resultsfamilial transmission significantly influences microbiota composition in conventionally housed nlrp6 inflammasome-deficient miceusing a cross-sectional study of distinct lines of wt and gene- deficient mice we previously identified an altered microbial community in nlrp6 inflammasome-deficient mice  .

this analysis identified that gene-deficient mice clustered distinctively compared to wt mice bred and maintained in the same facility c r2  0.265 p  0.001. however an even larger effect was noted to derive from the factor ''colony'' r2  0.349 p  0.001. notably the factor ''cage'' had a lower but significant effect compared to ''genotype'' r2  0.172 p  0.05. finally whenonly comparing mice with the same genotype we confirmed that association with different colonies explained a large fraction of the variability in microbiota composition in nlrp6-- asc-- and casp111-- mice d-1f r2s  0.487 0.555 and 0.408 respectively p  0.001. prevotellaceae which we previ- ously identified to be enriched in nlrp6-- mice   had the highest abundance in nlrp6-- mice compared to wt asc-- and casp111-- mice g but significant differences were observed in colonies of nlrp6-- mice  h p  0.001 kruskal-wallis test.

therefore we introduced the microbiota of conventionally housed dysbiotic nlrp6-- mice conv-dys  into espf wt rag2-- and nlrp6-- mice through fecal transplantation ft a. comparison of fecal microbiota composition before espf and after espfconv-dys ft revealed two main clusters one comprising mice before challenge and another one comprising mice receiving the ft as well as the donor mice b. anal- ysis of otus present in recipients and donor mice demonstrated that 86 of the otus from the donor community were being transferred into all three recipient lines c. within the cluster of ft recipient mice further sub-clustering was observed d and pairwise comparisons between wt and gene- deficient mice revealed no significant genotype-driven differ- ence between wt and nlrp6-- mice using fecal dna after4 weeks but between wt and rag2-- mice e and 3f.

hence in general distinct community structures and particularly exposure to specific pathobionts are likely required to cause imbalances in the microbiota as their development depends on specific interactions between com- mensals pathobionts and the host immune system.experimental proceduresmouse lines housing conditions and rederivationthe generation of nlrp3tm1flv nlrp3-- nlrp6tm1flv nlrp6-- b6.129- nlrp3tm1flv-nlrp6tm1flv nlrp3--nlrp6-- pycardtm1flv asc-- casp1tm2flv casp1-- casp4tm1akompwtsi casp11-- casp1tm1flv casp111-- ll1btm1yiw il1b-- ll1atm1yiw il1a-- ighmtm1cgn mumt-- tcrbtm1momtcrdtm1mom tcrb--tcrd-- and rag2tm1fwa rag2-- has been previously described.colonies of conventionally housed wt nlrp6-- asc-- casp111-- and rag2-- mice on a c57bl6n background were bred and maintained within one large animal facility using standard housing conditions i.e.

along these lines a recent study has challenged the pro- posed role of the nlrp6 inflammasome in shaping the micro- biome claiming that a generalizable impact of this nlrp6 was not detectable upon rederivation of these mice into specific pathogen-free spf conditions .

since nlrp6 has been proposed to specifically modulate the mucosal barrier  we next investigated the microbiota composition in the intestinal lumen or the mucus layer of nlrp6-- and rag2-- mice.

this demonstrates that upon exposure to pathobiont-containing communities de- ficiencies in adaptive immune cells have a broad impact on mi- crobiota composition while deficiency in nlrp6 has a rather distinctive but readily detectable influence on the metabolically active communities in the colon.increased abundance of pathobionts in mice deficient of nlrp6 and adaptive immunitywe next explored the taxonomic composition of the bacteria which differs between genotypes in the lumen of the colon.

wt b6n nlrp6-- n6 and rag2-- rag2 mice bred in espf conditions were subjected to a fecal transplantation ft from conventionally housed nlrp6-- mice.

to identify whether partic- ular otus are associated to nlrp6-- as well as rag2-- we identify the fraction of shared otus from a total of 41 distinct otus enriched in gene-deficient mice and then the ones shared between the different colonic sites of rag2-- and nlrp6-- mice respectively a table s2.

however notably the shared otus are enriched in potential pathobionts from the phylum proteobacteria suggesting that these bacteria potentially benefit from deficiencies in nlrp6 and adaptive immunity.besides its function as inflammasome sensor nlrp6 has been demonstrated to regulate nuclear factor kb nf-kb and mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk signaling as well as to contribute to antiviral effector functions  .

specifically we measured the concentration of active il-18 and the gene expression of nlrp6 casp1 and il18 in the colon of wt and nlrp6-- mice housed under conventional and espf condi- tions as well as 4 weeks after reintroduction of the dysbiotic community.

this suggests that inflammasome-independent effects of nlrp6 may be responsible for the observed effect on the micro- biota or that nlrp6 controls intestinal inflammasome activation only during specific periods after colonization which should be carefully investigated in future studies involving time-resolved global immune monitoring under differing housing conditions.together our observation that the abundances of da otus vary strongly at different anatomical sites reiterates the notion that specific immune mechanisms as well as environmental and ecological parameters shape microbial colonization throughout the gi tract.discussionlaboratory animals are an essential experimental model for investigating the interplay between host and microbiota and our knowledge of the complexity of host-microbiota interaction in laboratory animals is still growing  .
