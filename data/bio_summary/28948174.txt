Associ- ations of RA with HLA-DRB1 alleles have been observed in all racial and ethnic populations The shared epitope SE a 5-amino acid sequence motif in positions 70-74 of the HLA-DRb chain is the most significant genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis Some SE alleles suchas HLA-DRB10401 appear to confer a higher risk than others moreover the presence of two SE alleles and in particular HLA-DRB104010404 confers a high risk to develop the disease and has also an influence on disease severity SE alleles are associated with ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis but only relatively weakly with ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis SE alleles might contribute to the genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis causing an immune dysregulation controllingboth specificity and amount of ACPA production or a premature immunosenescence In genetically disease-susceptible individuals subsequent environmental triggers might induce rheumatoid arthritis development.

The gut microbiota is the major source of microbes that may exert beneficial as well as pathogenic effects on human health Encouraged by studies that show alterations in intes- tinal microbiota composition in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis the interest of studying microorgan- isms as potential candidates in the development of autoim- munity has been renewed -Findings supporting the idea that the onset of autoimmu- nity may be related to gastrointestinal tract are as follows 1 microbial composition in subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis differs to controls with a reduction of certain bacte- ria belonging to the family Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and a marked increase of species belonging to the genus Prevotella 2 In murine models the parenteral injection of cell wall fragments from various intestinal bacte- ria is arthritogenic and in this model arthritis is not developed when bred in germ-free conditions otherwise it is presented when intestinal bacterial species are introduced 3 Diet has been shown to influence inflammatory activity levels 4 Some drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis have antimicrobial effects chloroquine sulfasala- zine minocycline and roxithromycin -5 Altered microbiome was partially restored to normality in patients showing clinical improvement after prescribing disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs So differences incomposition of intestinal microbiota and in the immune system function could determine which patients develop the disease.A great effort is currently being made to study subjects with rheumatoid arthritis in preclinical phase.

These antibodies are often present in the blood long before any sign of joints' inflammationsuggesting that the triggering of autoimmunity might occur at different sites to the joints for example the gastrointestinal tract or airway Epidemiological studies suggest rheuma- toid arthritis as the result of complex interactions between genes environmental and hormonal factors and the immune system There is a genetic susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis by a tendency to familial aggregation a concordance between monozygotic twins and an association with some histo- compatibility antigens Heritability estimates have suggested a 60-70 genetic risk factors responsible for developing rheumatoid arthritis Candidate gene or genome-wide association studies have identified differentrisk loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis etiology.

ACPAs could be isotypes IgG IgA or IgM with an altered glycosylation status that confers enhanced Fc-receptor and citrullinated antigen binding ACPAs themselves can be pathogenic by acti- vating either macrophages or osteoclasts via immune com- plex formation and Fc-receptor engagement or probably by binding membrane citrullinated vimentin thus promoting bone loss Since the original description of antibodies as citrulli- nated antigens in a subpopulation of rheumatoid arthritis patients it has become clear that citrullinated epitopes of a large number of autoantigens as well as antigens derived from microorganisms can be recognized by highly specific antibodies for rheumatoid arthritis Alterations at specific mucosal sites suggest that microbial factors might affect mucosal immune response also playing an impor- tant role in early pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis Alterations in compositional diversity and abundance levels of microbiota that is dysbiosis can trigger several types of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases through the imbalance of T cell subpopulations such as Th1 Th2 Th17 and Treg cells Dysbiosis in one or more mucosal sites leads to immune alterations and breaks in self-tolerance to citrullinated auto- antigens Mucosal body surfaces such as respiratory and gastrointestinal tract carry out complex tasks as they must 1 remain tolerant against innocuous environmental nutritional and microbial antigens to ensure organ function and 2 set efficient immune responses against invadingpathogens Lung and gut tissues contain immunological cells able to initiate an immune response an attractive possi- bility is that the triggering of T cell-mediated immunity to citrullinated autoantigens can occur in the mucosae after presentation of neoantigens by APCs In mucosal site possible roles for citrullinated microbial antigens and molecular mimicry Toll-like receptor TLR signals and other innate immune activators and danger signals might exist Mucosa-associated bacterial flora and smoking or environmental particles silica dust act on immune cells neutrophils dendritic cells and macrophages as pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage them leading to inflammation onset circulating cytokines and chemokine increase along with autoantigen production.

The bacterial and viral components are an attractive source of antigens capable of inducing rheumatoid arthritis and therefore have been the most investigated as potential causal agents However there is no conclusive evidence to date of a causal relationship of a microorganism with rheumatoid arthritis.In recent years characterization and understanding of this gut microbiota has increased and constitutes a wide research field especially in autoimmune diseases.

Some publications suggest that rheumatoid arthritis early treatment leads to better long-term outcomes and perhaps to increased rates of drug-free remission  Prevention concept is an emerging research field in rheumatology area in which modifications of the microbiota could be a new way of modulating the disease.Immunopathogenesis of Rheumatoid ArthritisUnderstanding the complex molecular processes that play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is still a challenge.

Preclinical rheumatoid arthritis comprises the period in which the autoimmunity is detectable until the beginning of the inflammation andor injury of clinically apparent tissue genetic and environmental risk factors interact probably sequentially to initiate and propagate the development of autoimmunity finally resulting in detectable tissue inflammation and lesion If any other risk factor is involved in the onset andor spread of the disease it is still unknown.ACPAs' response might be important to transition from preclinical phase to clinical expression of rheumatoid arthri- tis.

ACPAs' repertoire analysis prior to diagnosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed that this immune response starts in a very restricted manner and expands to several months or even years epitope spreading from one initially recognized epitope towards reactivity to many different epitopes before the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthri- tis Epitope spreading towards more citrulli- nated ones is compatible with the possibility that a single antigen but not always the same is responsible for starting up the immune response Sokolove et al.

The citrullinated antigens are processed and presented by the APCs to the T cells which are activated and in turn activate the B cell leading to the production of autoanti- bodies Autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis are not tissue- and organ-specific but comprise a large collection of posttranslational modified proteins Smoking and other stimuli might initiate citrullination by PAD activation for- mation of lymphoid structures that could enhance antigen presentation and T and B cell production Potential mechanisms by which cigarette smoke CS promotes rheumatoid arthritis include release of intracellular proteins from reactive oxidative substances activated or injured cells augmentation of autoreactive B cell function and alteration of a many cell signaling pathways involved in cellular activation b cigarette smoke-impaired antigen-presenting cells c regulatory T cell functions and d T cell activation by antigens found in cigarette smoke Microbiota and the Immune SystemMicrobial exposures in gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts are key determinants of the overall immune tone at these mucosal barriers and represent a leading target for future intervention strategies Gut is an entryway for various environmental antigens in the form of food or infectious agents.
