Probiotics and intestinal commensals crucial interacting partners of the gut immune system  are increasingly being considered for treatment of various enteric infections including human retrovirus HRV diarrhea  human norovirus gas- troenteritis  antibiotic-associated diarrhea  and also to modulate protective antiviral immunity .The beneficial effects of probiotics in reducing the severity of RV diarrhea and modulating viral immunity were observed in randomized clinical studies  and experimental studies in ani- mal models  .

Thus further studies are required to assess whether any differ- ence exists between G and G- bacteria in binding properties with various enteric viruses and the impact on the course of viral pathogenicity.CONCLUSiONComparison of the beneficial effects of G and G- probiotics and intestinal commensals indicated that the selected G- probiotichad higher beneficial effects in inducing protective immunity against enteric pathogens such as HRV as compared with the selected G probiotics in humans and animal models.

Expression of histo-blood group antigens HBGA was observed in some G- intestinal commensal bacteria  and certain of those HBGA-expressing bacteria were shown to enhance  enteric viral infection.

Specifically LGG was selected as a G probiotic because of its well-documented effects in reducing the severity of RV diarrhea in children .
