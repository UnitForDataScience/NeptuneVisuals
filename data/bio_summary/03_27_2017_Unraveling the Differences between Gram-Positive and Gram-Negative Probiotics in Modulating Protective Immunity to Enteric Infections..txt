Thus the distinct ability of G- bacteria such as EcN in modulating frequencies and functions of DCs may have beneficial impacts on induction of protective immunity against pathogens.In our recently published study  we observed higher NK cytotoxic function and increased frequencies of pDCs in EcN colonized compared with LGG colonized or uncolonized piglets.The enhanced NK cell activity coincided with higher serum IL-12 levels in vivo in EcN colonized piglets  and also DC production of IL-12 in vitro .

Further Lactobacillus strains have significant effects in reducing diarrhea severity in children affected by enteric diseases .The effectiveness of probiotics in preventing or treating a disease is dependent on several factors such as class or strains of probiotics the dosage of probiotics and heterogeneity of study subjects  .
