In this review dietary interventions with SCFAs and HMOS have been discussed as examples of environmental factor-induced complex interplay between intestinal microbiota intestinal bar- rier function and immunity in the development of T1D.PATHOGeNeSiS OF T1DMolecular Pathogenic Mechanisms of T1DType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that involves several components of the immune system negatively interacting withpancreatic islets.

The alterations in gut microbiota composition could lead to aberrancies in the intesti- nal mucosal immune system such as increased gut permeabilitysmall intestinal inflammation and loss of tolerance to food anti- gens all of which are associated with the development of T1D.Leaky Gut in T1DThe intestinal epithelial cells form a permeable luminal lining of the GI tract and are important in the absorption of nutrients and the protection against harmful substances.

Moreover infection of the intestinal epithelium with C. rodentum in 4-week-old NOD mice leading to interrupted intestinal barrier stimulated the development of T1D.

Collectively these results from animal studies suggest that intestinal permeability plays a pathogenic role in the onset and development of T1D and intestinal infec- tion caused loss of barrier function may contribute to a loss of pancreatic islets b-cells and insulitis in animal models .

These findings support that microbial-induced butyrate production and subsequent mucin synthesis with a corresponding enhancement of TJ may contrib- ute to the development of autoimmunity for T1D.SCFAs Modulate innate and Adaptive immunityNext to the effects of SCFAs on maintaining gut integrity several studies have shown that SCFAs play a pivotal role in promot- ing mucosal immune homeostasis and health via their direct immune-modulatory effects on immune cells such as intestinal DCs and intestinal epithelial cells.

Mucins are required for the maintenance of an adequate mucus layer that covers the intestinal epithelium and thereby forms a physical barrier that protects the intestinal epithelium from exposure to antigens.

The specific selection and influence of HMOS in encouraging or inhibiting colonization of other specific micro- bial groups such as Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes in the context of T1D should be investigated in more detail and implemented with great care.HMOS May Maintain intestinal Barrier Function in a Microbiota-independent MannerBesides modulating gut integrity indirectly via specific micro- biota it can be speculated that HMOS may also have direct effect on intestinal barrier function based on the current evidence of prebiotic oligosaccharides.

These findings suggest that specific prebiotic oligosaccharides can support the maintenance of barrier integrity although there is currently no evidence regarding the direct microbiota- independent effects of authentic HMOS on this aspect available.Future research is needed to elucidate and verify the beneficial potential of HMOS regarding maintaining intestinal barrier function which may contribute to the proposed protective effects of HMOS against T1D.HMOS Modulate Systemic and Mucosal immune SystemAlthough changes in gut microbiota composition and intestinal mucosal environment can indirectly influence the immune system it is also likely that HMOS may act directly on systemic immune cells since specific HMOS such as 2'-FL 3'-sialyllactose 6'-sialyllactose and LNnT have been detected within the intes- tine and in systemic circulation  .

Factors influencing pathogenesis including a leaky intestinal mucosal barrier an aberrant gut microbiota composition and altered immune responsiveness offer potential targets for prevention andor treatment of T1D through nutritional or pharmacologic means.
