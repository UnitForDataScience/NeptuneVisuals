Mice with obese phenotypes have significantly less Bacteroidetes and more Firmicutes in their gut compared with lean and wildtype mice.75 Interestingly when germ-free mice are administered stool from conventionally raised mice it led to weight gain and increased insulin resistance despite a reduction in intake.76 Increased carbohydrate uptake and subse- quent lipogenesis due to processing of nutrients by the gut micro- biota likely leads to this effect.76 Similarly weight gain is seen with a high-fat diet after changing the environment from germ- free to conventional raising conditions suggesting that diet may modulate the gut microbiota composition.7677 Germ-free mice who receive FMT from obese donor mice have significantly greater weight gain compared to those who receive FMT from lean donor mice.78 An anecdotal observation revealed significant weight gain after FMT for CDI using donor stool from an over- weight individual is intriguing.43 Larger studies have now shown that one-time FMT for CDI does not effect on body weight or body mass index BMI irrespective of donor BMI.79 In one study FMT from lean unaffected donors to patients withmetabolic syndrome temporarily increased peripheral insulin sen- sitivity.80 These changes positively correlated with an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria.Several questions including donor choice lean donors related donors family donors etc.

In a retrospective study of patients who underwent FMT for recurrent CDI with resolution of diarrhea and CDI and had three or more UTI episodes the year prior had a significant decrease in the frequency of UTIs the year after FMT compared to patients with recurrent UTI and CDI who were managed with standard of care antibiotics for CDI despite resolution of diarrhea and CDI.86 Additionally there was a significant improvement in antibiotic resistance patterns in subsequent UTIs causing pathogens compared in FMT recipients compared to standard of care.86 Prospective and randomized data are needed to study the role of FMT in management of recurrent UTIs.REGULATORY ASPECTS OF MICROBIOTA REPLACEMENTThe FDA has issued but not enforced a policy regarding the use of FMT to treat CDI not responsive to standard therapies.

The patho- physiology of recurrent CDI involves disruption of normal microbiota and FMT restores the diversity of the gut microbiota and prevents further infection Figure 1.26 Interestingly in one small case series of five CDI patients transfer of sterile filtrates from donor stool was sufficient to eliminate symptoms sugges- ting that components other than bacteria such as host secretions or microbial metabolites may be sufficient or an alternative approach.27Efficacy of FMT for CDIThe initial evidence for FMT for CDI was limited to case series and case reports.28 A meta-analysis of case series with no placebo-controlled studies described a cure rate of 89 with one or more infusions of FMT to prevent future recurrent CDI epi- sodes.17 A randomized controlled trial from Europe published in 2013 included patients with multiply recurrent CDI and com- pared the use of vancomycin followed by an infusion of donor feces via nasoduodenal infusion to the standard vancomycin regi- men and standard vancomycin regimen followed by bowel lavage.

However in CDI patients with IBD there was a higher proportion of the original community after FMT and higher subsequent episodes of CDI on long-term follow-up.59 Although the recipient microbiota composition post-FMT is dif- ferent from pretransplant the degree of similarity to the donor microbiota after FMT is different among patients.566061 It has been shown that donor bacteria can persist in recipients up to 2 years post-FMT.62 In a recent study of FMT for CDI in immu- nocompromised stem cell recipients a shotgun metagenomic approach to examine both short- and long-term bacterial engraft- ment demonstrated that although concordance was observed between microbiota composition of the donor and recipient in the short-term concordance was reduced after 1 year suggesting that FMT cannot indefinitely supersede environmental or host factors in shaping future bacterial composition.63MICROBIOTA REPLACEMENT FOR INDICATIONS OTHER THAN CDIFecal microbiota transplantation is a potential emerging thera-peutic option for diseases implicated in altered microbial compo- sitions.

A systematic review of FMT for patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated clinical remission rates of 60.5 higher than ulcerative colitis resolution rates of 22.66 The subgroup analysis for Crohn's disease consisted of four studies and demonstrated moderate heterogeneity and a higher response rate was mainly driven by one study of nine patients with success being associated with microbial engraftment.67 The majority of data for FMT is in patients with ulcerative colitis where random- ized controlled trials have conflicting data but pooled data dem- onstrate a moderate benefit.68 In one randomized controlled trial of 38 adults with active ulcerative colitis FMT induce remission with a significant risk difference of 17 between FMT and pla- cebo.

More research is needed to understand the differences between related and unrelated donors and there may be opportunities for donor-recipient matching or defined microbial consortia for FMT in non-CDI indications as we expand our understanding of the host-microbiota interac- tions and explore ways to stably make meaningful changes in the host microbiota to potentially alter disease course.Recipient considerationsRecipient considerations for FMT in non-CDI indications include decisions on benefit or lack of benefit of administration of gut-specific antibiotics such as rifaximin or oral vancomycin prior to FMT bowel preparation and changes in systemic medica- tions prior to FMT.

After a 10-week period of initial follow-up 81 of patients in the FMT group had resolution with one infusion and 94 with two infusions compared with 31 receiving vancomycin alone and 23 receiving vancomycin and bowel lavage.29 A recent trial done in the United States for patients with recurrent CDI dem- onstrated that donor FMT via colonoscopy was more effective than autologous FMT 90 vs. 62.5.30 Similar findings have been seen in other trials and case series.

At our center we use a Seward stomacher for stool preparation.53 In order to standardize FMT processes ensure stool availability and minimize cost of screening and proc- essing approaches based on frozen stool are being developed.lowing initial antibiotic therapy for CDI.58 Another observa- tional study demonstrated that FMT led to a significant change in microbial diversity in patients with recurrent CDI but the degree of engraftment was not key for successful treatment of CDI by FMT.

Broad-spectrum antibi- otics disrupt the microbiota which leads to introduction and proliferation of MDROs such as vancomycin-resistant enterococ- cus and extended-spectrum b-lactamase producers.83 A recent study demonstrated that FMT for recurrent CDI eradicated vancomycin-resistant enterococci VRE colonization in 73 of VRE-positive patients.84 In another study FMT was safe and effective in patients with blood disorders for eradication of MDROs from the gastrointestinal tract.85 Future research is needed to better define host gastrointestinal microbiota in patients with MDROs and delineate beneficial methods to nor- malize the composition by methods such as defined microbial consortia or FMT to eradicate MDROs.Urinary tract infectionRecurrent urinary tract infections UTIs are common and pose frequent management challenges including antibiotic choice due to worsening resistance patterns with each infection.

Additionally the FDA sug- gested that data related to the use and study of FMT to treat dis- eases or conditions other than CDI are limited and FMT for indications other than CDI should only be performed under an IND.87There has been a commercial stool bank OpenBiome estab- lished that supplies stool for a fee to perform FMT.
