thus the antigen- specific t cell status may provide detailed information about the past acute and future interaction status of the host with a certain pathogen.th cell subset diversity in tolerance pathogen protection and immune pathology diagnostic need for a ''global view''th cell phenotypes and functions display considerable heterogeneity reflecting different types of immune reactions against the different types of antigens or pathogens ranging from tolerogenic to protective non-protective or even pathogenic responses such as hypersensitivity reactions.

due to these limitations of many currently used assays the inter- pretation of available data about human fungus- specific th cells is difficult and hence the role of th cells for antifungal immunity for the different types of host-pathogen interaction is only poorly understood.direct detection of fungus-specific treg and tcon via divergent expression of cd154 and cd137to overcome the current challenges with regard to fungus-specific th cell detection we have recently introduced antigen-specific t cell enrichment arte which allows comprehensive analysis of all relevant th cell subsets specific for fungal antigens  .

thus the integration of all t cell subsets naive memory treg into the analysis of specific t cell responses against an individual pathogen as well as investigation of further parameters such as clonal composition of the t cell repertoire and functional avidityaffinity of the anti- gen-specific t cells provides a more reliable basis to identify antigens which have generated immune responses in a certain individual and what type of immune response has been induced.t cell-based diagnostics for fungus-associated diseasesas outlined above there is evidence that th cells are involved in protective immune responses against fungi in healthy individuals encompassing both invasive infections as well as hypersensitivities.

further exploring whether t cell frequencies and phenotypic changes may also be helpful to diagnose fungal infections in immunocompetent persons such as patients with cf is currently ongoing.fungal allergiesfungus-specific th2 cell development is an example for an obvious qualitative alteration in t cell reactiv- ity which may be used as an early diagnostic marker for allergic sensitization.
