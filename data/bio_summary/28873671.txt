The same was observed by fi with coffee melanoidins.

The production of SCFAs derived from the gut microbiota metabolism was also investigated.

The process by which the BC was cleaned of crumb and the extraction of its soluble and insoluble fractions by enzymatic digestion with pronase are de- scribed in a previous paper by .

The cleaned BC was lyophilizedand added to the AIN-93G diet to reach a final concentration of 10.

The amount of bread crust included in the diet was set on the basis of aprevious study performed in adolescents   i.e.

The difference be- tween whole BC and its fractions was completed with AIN-93G diet.

The mean - SD nutrient content of the diets was moisture  7.9 - 0.3 protein g kg 167.7 - 3.9 fat gkg 77.8 - 1.5 and ashes  2.6 - 0.2.The presence of the Amadori products 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural HMF and CML has been widely used to monitor the extent of MR in cereal-derived products  .

The animals were in- dividually housed in metabolic cages in an environmentally controlled room under standard conditions temperature 20-22 degC with a 12 h light-dark cycle and 55-70 humidity.

The rats had ad libitum access to their diets and demineralized water Milli-Q Ultrapure Water System Millipore Corps.

The feces were weighed lyophilized powdered and then homogenized.
