Finally we did not detect differences in bacterial proliferation rates in the niche in a 20 hr period when larvae of the different genotypes with or without copper cells were present and when the initial bacterial inoc- ulum was kept identical among conditions G. There- fore the initial bacterial inoculum or the quantity of bacteria defecated alive by larvae on a fresh susbtrate is the main param- eter dictating the evolution of the bacterial population in the niche in a 20 hr period.

Therefore DrosophilaLp symbiosis represents a facultative nutritional mutualism paradigm that may apply to the symbioses between bacterial and animal species with nomadic lifestyles and changing dietary environments.While a lot of attention has been dedicated to the taxonomic classification of symbiotic bacteria that modulate the physiology of their animal partner or to the bacterial mechanisms granting physiological benefits to the host little is known regarding the animal factors that impact bacterial fitness and that are potentially implicated in the perpetuation of animal-bacteria symbiosis.

In contrast to the control larvae LpWJL load remained constant in the niche colonized by larvae with acid-less guts D. In addition the decrease in LpWJL loads in acid-less larvae is delayed compared with mex controls at 4 hr post-transfer E. One explanation could be that acid-less larvae need more time to purge the initially higher bacterial burden held in their guts H. However mex and acid-less larvae do not show a rebound in gut bacterial load 24 hr after transfer as observed with yw larvae B.

This demonstrates that the higher number of bacterial cells found alive on the food matrix 4 hr post-transfer of monoassociated acid-less larvae is directly responsible for the higher titer observed at 24 hr post-transfer F. These re- sults indicate that removing the acidic region in the host's midgut preserves more live LpWJL cells during gut transit and as a consequence the excretion of LpWJL cells onto the food matrix is increased and substrate colonization is accelerated.To refine our analysis we usedlivedead bacteria stains to probe bacterial survival throughout the intestine.

Asterisks represent a statistically significant difference with initial burden at the time of transfer t  0 hr A and B or between the food matrix bacterial burden at t  4 hr and t  24 hr post-transfer C. To plot all data points on a log scale a value of ''1'' was attributed to samples with no detectable CFU and these have been marked ''ND'' not detected.D-F Evolution of bacterial loads after transfer of mono-associated larvae with guts depleted of their acidic region.

As a control a solution collected after bathing dead larvae overnight in PBS failed to promote bacterial maintenance Figure S3G.Collectively our observations indicate that the intestinal excreta of larvae are sufficient to sustain bacterial maintenance and that this effect is not explained by the supply of non-assim- ilated dietary nutrients contained in larval feces.
