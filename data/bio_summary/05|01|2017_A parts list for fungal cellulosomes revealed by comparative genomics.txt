First we collected all Neocallimastigomycota proteins with best BLASTp hits to bacteria excluding top hits to other Neocallimastigomycota minimumE-value of 1e-5 then excised each non-NCDD Pfam domain present in the Neocallimastigomycota 'Neo' DDP proteins and used that domain to extract the corresponding sequences from the proteins of 1774 IMG genomes one representative strain from each species and 394 MycoCosm genomes excludingNeo fungi.

However since the first report of cellulosome-like structures in anaerobic fungi more than twenty years ago the identification of dockerin-binding cohesins or scaffoldins that mediate assembly has yet to be accomplished due to a lack of genomic data functional proteomics and characterized strains.Genomic analysis of five unique anaerobic fungi revealed the presence of almost 1600 total dockerin domain proteins DDPs proteins that contain NCDDs across genera Supplementary Table 1 with diverse functionality primarily related to plant carbohydrate binding and biomass degradation and Supplementary Table 2.

robustus MycoCosm ID Anasp1 and the bacterial protein from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus IMG ID .among the most represented proteins in supernatant and cellulosome fractions in three diverse isolates of gut fungi and their amino-acid sequences encode hallmarks of a membrane-anchored scaffoldin molecule including an N-terminal secretion motif a C-terminal membrane anchor and a repeating amino-acid motif in between.These scaffoldins are encoded in all sequenced Neocallimastigomycota representing four of the eight genera of gut fungi identified to date and absent in other fungi.

mRNA was purified from 1 ug of total RNA using magnetic beads containing poly-T oligos fragmented and reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and SSII Invitrogen followed by second strand synthesis.

DNA was sheared to 10 kb fragments using the g-TUBE Covaris or templates were size-selected using the Sage Science BluePippin instrument with a 10 kb minimum cutoff.

Second we aligned the non-NCDD domains and their selected homologues using MAFFT with poorly aligned positions removed using trimAI.

The data files were then interrogated using a target-decoy approach   using MSGFPlus  with a -20 ppm parent mass tolerance no specific digestion enzyme settings and a variable post-translational modification of oxidized methionine.

Following elution of target proteins the buffer was exchanged to PBS pH 7.4 using Zeba desalting columns Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Protein sequences for each reported entry were subjected to BLAST analysis version 2.2.28  using a combined collection of 2784909 fungal proteins reported in the Uniprot knowledgebase   and NCBI   combining all .faa files as of September 2014.

Here we describe a comprehensive set of proteins critical to fungal cellulosome assembly including conserved scaffolding proteins unique to the Neocallimastigomycota.
