Psaltis1  Peter-John Wormald1Published online 7 August 2017 Springer ScienceBusiness Media LLC 2017AbstractPurpose of Review Perturbations in local microbiota have been demonstrated in many chronic inflammatory diseases including chronic rhinosinusitis CRS.

Sinus microbiota varies among chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes and predicts surgical outcome.

Decreased diversity of nasal microbiota and their secreted extracel- lular vesicles in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis based on a metagenomic analysis.

Medical therapy reduces microbiota diversity and evenness in surgically recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis.

Patients exhibited a wide of range of sinus microbiota profiles prior to treatment with highly individual-specific microbiota changes after max- imal medical therapy.

This supported the emerging theory that bacte- ria could be present in health and disease.Since the application of next genomic sequencing NGS to the study of chronic rhinosinusitis the presence of previously considered pathogenic bacteria in all healthy individuals has been conclusively demonstrated.

Although well de- scribed in gastrointestinal research their use in chronic rhinosinusitis remains limited.
