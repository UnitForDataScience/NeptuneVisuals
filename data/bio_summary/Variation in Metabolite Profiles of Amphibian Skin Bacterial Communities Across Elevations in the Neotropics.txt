Axis labels MDS represent the multi-dimensional scalingalthough an understanding of the variation in the function of animal-associated bacterial communities across elevations is scarce in free-living soil microbial communities changes in environmental factors across elevations were associated with changes in community function therefore influencing microbe-mediated nitrogen dynamics .While the structure of bacterial communities on S. flotator was also relatively consistent among sites with the exception of LowCope there was variation across sites in metabolite profiles.

Considering the minimal variation in community structure of these bacterial communities across sites we suggest that fur- ther characterization of the functions of these communities could be a promising area of research to elucidate how diver- sity influences function across environmental gradients.

Unless noted all analyses were conducted in R version 3.2.2 .Alpha and Beta Diversity AnalysesAlpha diversity comparisons of skin bacterial communities between elevations and across sites were conducted for rich- ness OTUsindividual phylogenetic diversity and the Shannon index H' which assessed community evenness.

As Bd has been associated with drastic global amphibian population de- clines  and infects over 500 amphibian species across the globe  interest has grown in understanding the factors that shape these microbial communities and their function.In general relatively little is known about how envi- ronmental factors influence the structure and function of host-associated microbial communities although there is certainly appreciation more broadly for the role of con- text dependency in determining the outcome of symbi- otic interactions -.

In addition the absence of an elevational pattern in the diversity of these amphibian-associated bacterial communities seems to be somewhat consistent with observations of free-living soil bacterial communities where no consistent elevational pat- terns have been observed.

This could partially explain the variable results regarding skinbacterial communities across Bd exposure experiments and across field studies working on distinct species   -.We found that a very small fraction 0.7 of the OTUs found on S. flotator can be considered as members of the core microbiome.

Alpha diversity pairwise comparisons among sites showed a poten- tial west to east trend especially for richness and phylogenetic diversity estimates where the sites west of the Panama Canal had significantly higher diversity estimates than those on the east side Fig.

Some amphibian species har- bor bacterial skin communities that can inhibit the growth of Bd and therefore there is interest in understanding whether environmental context could also alter these host-associated microbial communities in a way that might ultimately impact Bd dynamics.

Species-specific responses of skin bacterial communities to Bd might add complexity to the studies addressing the ecological processes shaping the composition structure and function of these communities.

In recent decades culture- independent molecular techniques have rapidly expand- ed our knowledge of the diversity ubiquity and func- tional ability of these symbiotic communities.
