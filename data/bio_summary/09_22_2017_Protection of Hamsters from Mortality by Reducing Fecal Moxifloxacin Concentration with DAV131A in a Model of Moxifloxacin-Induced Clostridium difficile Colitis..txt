similarly we showed previously that oral dav131a a charcoal-based adsorbent decreased intestinal colonization by -lactam- resistant klebsiella pneumoniae in cefotaxime-treated mice .here we used the syrian hamster model of c. difficile infection which recapitulates many aspects of the human infection  and has been used widely to evaluate new therapies against c. difficile infection  to assess the protective effect of dav131a.

indeed a polymeric toxin-binding compound had been shown to protect only 70 to 90 of hamsters in an animal model of clindamycin-induced c. difficile infection  however 20 to 40 of animals from the toxin-binding treatment group still had diarrhea 15 days after cessation of therapy whereas protected animals in the experiments reported here had no signs of disease data not shown.the schedule of dav131a administration 4 h before concomitant with or 2 h afterthe first moxifloxacin administration did not significantly affect the protective effect as assessed by survival fecal free moxifloxacin concentration and c. difficile count in feces  see fig.

furthermore the symptoms of c. difficile infection are related to the action of toxins produced by pathogenic strains of c. difficile  whose presence and activity could not be assessed from fecal samples in our studies.

indeed the hamster model of c. difficile infection is appropriate for reproducing the deleterious impact of antibiotic treatments on the gut microbiota that allows c. difficile spores to germinate and the disease to develop .

this should be investigated further in human studies.it can thus be inferred from our results that dav131a protected animals against c. difficile colonization and infection by preventing the disruption of the gut bacterial microbiota which is known to occur during fluoroquinolone treatments  and which constitutes the primary risk factor for c. difficile infection in humans .

data below the loq were imputed to the loq.fecal counts of c. difficile were determined extemporaneously at d3 on the h12-to-h24 pool by plating serial dilutions of the samples on bbl c. difficile selective agar bd.

a total of 215 hamsters receiving moxifloxacin subcutaneously day 1 d1 to d5 were orally in- fected at d3 with c. difficile spores.

moxifloxacin concentrations and c. difficile counts were deter- mined at d3 and mortality was determined at d12.

we compared mortality rates moxifloxacin concentrations and c. difficile counts according to dav131a regimen and modeled the links between dav131a regimen moxifloxacin concentration and mortality.

significant dose-dependent relationships between dav131a dose and i mortality ii moxifloxacin concentration and iii c. difficile count were evidenced.

in this model of c. difficile infection dav131a reduced mortality in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing the fecal free moxifloxacin concentra- tion.keywords clostridium difficile infection hamster animal model mortality prevention moxifloxacinlostridium difficile is a sporulating gram-positive bacillus that can lead to mild to severe intestinal infections including pseudomembranous colitis and toxic mega- colon .

with 500000 cases and 29000 deaths in 2011 in the united states  the burden of c. difficile infection on the u.s. health care system has reached 4.8 billion .c.
