Values for the C. difficile count at D3 weremissing for only 9215 hamsters 4.2 but as many as 121215 56.3 values were below the LOQ.Descriptive statistics on fecal free moxifloxacin concentrations C. difficile counts and mortality for each group in each study are reported in .All 100 95 confidence interval CI 90.0 to 100 35 hamsters from the control groups that received moxifloxacin but no DAV131A groups 1A 2A and 3A died they had a median fecal free moxifloxacin concentration of 53.8 ugg range 24.5 to 211.3 ugg at D3 at the time of C. difficile inoculation.

The abilities of fecal free moxifloxacin concentrations and C. difficile counts to predict death were assessed using the areas under the ROC curves and the 95 confidence interval computed using 1000 paired-bootstrap replicates R functions roc and ci.auc.For hamsters that received DAV131A treatment all groups except 1A 2A and 3A we compared fecal free moxifloxacin concentrations according to the administration or not of an additional initial dose of DAV131A at D1H-10 by using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test.The impact of the BID versus TID DAV131A administrations on the fecal free moxifloxacin concen-tration was tested in hamsters receiving a daily dose of DAV131A of 1800 mgkg and also receiving a dose of DAV131A at D1H-10 groups 1H 2B and 2C.

A fecal free moxifloxacin concentration of 53.8 ugg range 24.5 to 211.3 ugg a C. difficile count of 6.0 log10 CFUg range 3.1 to 7.8 log10 CFUg and a 100 mortality rate were observed for animals that did not receive DAV131A treatment while the fecal free moxifloxacin concentration C. difficile count and mortality were decreased to 7.3 ugg range 3.0 to 29.6 ugg 3.8 log10 CFUg range 3.1 to 5.9 log10 CFUg and 0 respectively with doses of 1800 mgkgday.

Indeed a polymeric toxin-binding compound had been shown to protect only 70 to 90 of hamsters in an animal model of clindamycin-induced C. difficile infection  however 20 to 40 of animals from the toxin-binding treatment group still had diarrhea 15 days after cessation of therapy whereas protected animals in the experiments reported here had no signs of disease data not shown.The schedule of DAV131A administration 4 h before concomitant with or 2 h afterthe first moxifloxacin administration did not significantly affect the protective effect as assessed by survival fecal free moxifloxacin concentration and C. difficile count in feces  see Fig.

We compared mortality rates moxifloxacin concentrations and C. difficile counts according to DAV131A regimen and modeled the links between DAV131A regimen moxifloxacin concentration and mortality.

We also developed a mathematical model to analyze the relationships between DAV131A regimens the fecal free moxifloxacin concentration and hamster mortality.This work was partly presented at IDWeek 2016 New Orleans LA 26 to 30 October 2016 .RESULTSComparison of mortality rates fecal free moxifloxacin concentrations and C. difficile counts across DAV131A doses.

Approximately 60 of the moxifloxacin excreted during D3 was retrieved from the fecal pellets collected during the period from 0 h H0 to H12.Comparison of fecal free moxifloxacin concentrations and C. difficile counts according to vital status.

It is not expected to cause any toxicity in hamsters since the minimal lethal intravenous dose reported for mice and rats is 100 mgkg .Animals were infected orally on day 3 D3 4 h after moxifloxacin administration H4 with 104 spores of the nonepidemic C. difficile strain UNT103-1 VA-11 REA J strain TcdA TcdB CdtB- vancomycin MIC 2 ugml moxifloxacin MIC 16 ugml clindamycin MIC  256 ugml and ceftriaxone MIC 128 ugml obtained from Curtis Donskey Ohio VA Medical Centre.

Among the 180 hamsters treated with DAV131A all groups except 1A 2A and 3A the administration of an additional initial dose of DAV131A at D1H-10 was significantly associated with a lower fecal free moxifloxacin concentration medianFIG 2 Box plots of fecal free moxifloxacin concentrations measured at D3 according to DAV131A daily dose administered for the 212 hamsters in the 3 pooled studies.
