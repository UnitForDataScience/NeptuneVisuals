The six most abundant families in each group were S24-7 Rikenella- ceae Bacteroidaceae Ruminococcaceae Prevotellaceae and Odoribacteraceae in the normal group S S24-7 Rikenellaceae Ruminococcaceae Bacteroidaceae Prevotel- laceae and Odoribacteraceae in the low dose group DS24-7 Rikenellaceae Ruminococcaceae Prevotella- ceae Odoribacteraceae and Bacteroidaceae in the medium dose group Z and S24-7 Rikenellaceae Ruminococcaceae Odoribacteraceae Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae in the high dose group G. Compared with S group the G group had different taxonomy at the family level.

The average number of OTUs was 1937 for the saline group 1984 for the low dose group 1912 for the medium dose group and 1880 for the high dose group.

however their ratio SRiRu changed between groups 7.41.51 for the S group 5.91.11 for the D group 8.80.81 for the Z group and 6.11.61 for the G group.

Statis- tical comparisons of the results were performed using an analysis of variance ANOVA in SPSS 13.0 P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.AbbreviationsANOVA Analysis of variance D Low melanin dose group 120 mgkg DHI 5 6-dihydroxyindole DHICA 5 6-dihydroxyinodole-2-carboxylic acidG High melanin dose group 480 mgkg IBD Inflammatory bowel diseases ICR Institute of Cancer Research MSMI Sepiella Maindroni InkOTUs Operational taxonomic units S Normal group Z Medium melanin dose group 240 mgkgAcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Xiong-Fei Ji Yi-Meng Yuan Ke-Er Yan Meng Han Yong-Kuan Ren Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Applied Marine Biotechnology Ningbo University for continuous technical advice and helpful discussion.

reported that sepia ink could prevent kidney dysfunction induced by bile duct ligation and the invasive of pulmonary aspergillosis Cephalopod ink is a mixture of the co-secretions from the ink sac including glycosaminoglycan-like polysaccha- rides a tyrosinase and melanin.

Additionally Bray-Curtis Cluster analysis showed that the low MSMI dose group was more similar to the normal group S.DiscussionThe Recent medical research proposed that cephalopod ink be a multifunctional bioactive marine drug and has the functions of antitumor antioxidant and anti- coagulant activities as well as the capability toFig.

The ink contains compounds that are cap- able of disrupting a predator's chemical senses  There is a long history of using cephalopod ink as medi- cine and food.

Mostly health benefits have been ascribed to cephalopod ink as a traditional medicine both in Western culture ancient Greece and Rome and Eastern culture China Recent medical research proposed that cephalopod ink is a multifunctional bioactive mar- ine drug and has the functions of antitumor antioxidant Correspondence 1Collaborative Innovation Center for Zhejiang Marine High-efficiency and Healthy Aquaculture Ningbo University Ningbo 315211 China2Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology Ministry of EducationSchool of Marine Science Ningbo University Ningbo 315211 Chinaand anti-coagulant activities as well as the capability to protection against testicular damage.

Our results may have important implica- tions for MSMI as functional food component and potential therapeutic for manipulating gut microbiota.MethodsPreparation of melanin from Sepiella Maindroni inkMelanin from Sepiella Maindroni was prepared as pre- viously reported  Briefly ink from fresh ink sacs was drained mixed 20-fold with ultrapure water and centrifuged 4000 g 10 min 4 degC.
