despite many studies that have reported that impaired immune system seen in asd that may be asso- ciated with gut microbiome the precise mechanisms of how and whether gut microbiome alterations in asd can cause immune ab- normalities observed in the disorder are not currently understood.novel therapeutic approaches targeting gut microbiome for asdsince a large number of publications have proved that gut micro- biota played critical roles in the pathogenesis of asd we can naturally think targeting gut microbiome may be an effective therapeutic ap- proach for such disorder.

with the increasing knowledge of microbiome it is be- lieved that asd-associated alterations of gut microbiome and its me- tabolites can directly and indirectly modulate corresponding immune and gi disorders and may play a possible role in the etiology of asd see .microbiome-associated maternal risk factorsthere are strong evidences from many epidemiological clinical and animal studies that showed that maternal infections as primarily in- fluencing the development of asd symptoms .

accumulating information of animal and human research have de- monstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics treatment in the im- provement of comorbid symptoms seen in asd providing an insight that targeting gut microbiome may be useful as a potential treatment for patients suffering such disorder.however the detailed roles of gut microbiome in the pathology of asd are still unclear and thus studies investigating mechanisms such as the contributions of immune neural and endocrine pathways in microbiome-brain communications are significant.

the underlying mechanisms of influences by scfas in the pathogenesis of asd were considered through the altered mitochondrial functions via the citric acid cycle and carnitine metabolism or the epigenetic modulation of asd-associated genes .another microbial metabolite p-cresol and its conjugated derivativep-cresylsulfate elevated in the urinary samples of asd children below 8 years of age were suggested as biomarkers of asd in small children especially females and more severely affected males .

lactisadministration of 4-week multispecies probiotics decreased cognitive reactivity to sad mood which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts.four-week consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulated activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.humans n  18children with asd also sufferinggi disordersstandardized human gut microbiotaadministration of 8-week fecal microbiota transplant significantly improved both gi- and asd-related symptoms in 16 out of 18 asd children.abbreviation gf germ free gi gastrointestinal bdnf brain-derived neurotrophic factor tnf-a tumor necrosis factor alpha ifn-g including interferon gamma gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid mrna messenger rna vta ventral tegmental area asd autism spectrum disorder mia maternal immune activation.demonstrated that oligosaccharides induced the growth of indigenous beneficial gut bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and ex- hibited neurotropic effects in rat models.

for instance a recent study on mice indicated that olfactory bulbectomy induced chronic depression elevated corticotropin-re- leasing hormone expression and serotonin levels associated with al- teration of motor activity and the microbial profile in the colon likely via activation of the hpa .underlying mechanisms by which gut microbiome is involved in asddespite numerous studies focused on the possible pathogenesis of asd the exact causes of this disease have not been clearly stated and the current theory points that asd should be a result of combinations including several genetic and environmental risk factors.

reported larger numbers of non-spore-forming anaerobes and microaerophilic bacteria from children with asd but no such bacteria were found in healthy children.although many studies reported changes of the gut microbiome in asd patients there is still little consensus on specific bacterial species that were similarly changed among independent researches.

this study is the first clinical trial to apply fmt treatment in asd disorder in humans and sheds light on the potential of targeting gut microbiome for asd treatment .

however some probiotics such as bifidobacteria and lactobacillus may re-establish the composition of the gut microbiome and exert benefits to gut microbial communities leading to amelioration or prevention of gut inflamma- tion and other intestinal or systemic diseases .communications among microbiome gut and brainever since the term of gut-brain axis was proposed and the first publication of preclinical studies that revealed the communication among gut microbiome gut and brain there are fast-growing studies focusing on this field and further deepening our understanding of those correlations .

morover a recent multi-case analysis of about 15000 asd patients indicated that almost 12 of asd individuals had comorbidity with bowel disorders .

revealed that increased numbers of sutterella as well as mucosa-associated ruminococcus torques in the stools from asd patients compared with community controls further confirmed and supplemented this conclusion.clostridium a common bacterium in gi is well-documented and the most possible cause for certain cases of asd .

according to the extremely close association of asd symptoms and chronic tetanus infection of gi boltehas proposed the hypothesized role of clostridium in the etiology of asd.

some lit- eratures suggested that clostridium acted as a pivotal factor in the etiology of asd because asd children exhibited ameliorated behavior communication and social skills in the gi manifestations of their dis- eases after oral vancomycin treatment an antibiotic well known mainly against clostridia .

the gut- or environmentally-derived p-cresol is potentially able to worsen asd severity and gut function but the precise me- chanisms are still poorly understood .there was a study using urinary metabolic phenotyping in asd children that indicated abnormal levels of mammalian-microbial common metabolites including dimethylamine hippuric and pheny- lacetylglutamine .
