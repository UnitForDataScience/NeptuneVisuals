these obser- vations largely disprove the hypothesis that stomach food exclu- sion is required for weight loss after rygb.rygb weight loss cannot be explained by ghrelin changes ghrelin is an appetite stimulating gastric hormone that hasbeen suggested to play a role in the weight loss effects of surgery.however circulating ghrelin levels do not consistently decrease or increase after rygb .rygb weight loss cannot be explained by entero-plasticity or new arrangement of the gut being sensed by the enteric or cen- tral nervous systemit is tempting to hypothesize that there could be something unique about the new arrangement of the gut after rygb which is perhaps sensed and interpreted by the nervous system and translated into weight loss.

totality of the evidence presented here strongly suggests that bypass of the stomach rather than the small bowel is required for weight loss after rygb.rygb weight loss cannot be explained by remnant stomach not seeing foodgiven the requirement for bypass of the stomach for weight loss effect of rygb one may argue that weight loss could be due to the fact that after rygb stomach no longer comes into contact with food.

in this article we will examine each of these hypotheses in detail and within the context of varia- tions of the rygb surgery and argue that the primary driver of rygb weight loss is the substantial shift in the gut microbiome induced by the surgery.air hypothesisrygb causes weight loss by disrupting gas homeostasis in the gi tractwe propose that the weight loss effect of rygb is primarily dri- ven by the surgery-induced changes in the gut microbiome.

relatively rare ggf cases where weight loss is still achieved or maintained  may be explained by a remaining capacity of roux limb to create negative pressure via peristalsis and draw the stored air in the remnant stomach towards the distal gut thanks to its proximity to the esophagus.air hypothesis suggests that the small size of the stomach inrygb is critically important for weight loss efficacy--not because of meal size restriction but because after rygb low stomachcapacitance helps with uncontrolled air infusion into the roux limb and leads to subsequent alteration of the colonic microbial ecosystem.clinical weight loss results from an endoluminal gastric bypass sleeve device are also consistent with the air hypothesis .

another way to test the validity of this the- ory could be to chronically deliver oxygen to the distal gut either pharmacologically or by other means and measure the resulting effect on the gut microbiota and metabolic parameters.arguments against previous hypotheses for rygb weight loss efficacyrygb weight loss cannot be explained by bile flow diversion or increase in serum bile acidsit has been proposed that changes in bile flow due to bypass of proximal small bowel may contribute to weight loss effect of rygb .

ggf leads to weight regain or poor weight loss in majority of cases and closure of ggf by surgery restores weight loss .

intriguingly the weight loss efficacy with this device is comparable to rygb  60 excess weight loss at 1 year.

even though most ggf cases lead to weight regain or inadequate weight loss post-rygb surgery there are still docu- mented cases where excellent weight loss is achieved in spite of a ggf even though upper gi series confirm alimentary flow pre- dominantly through the ggf into the remnant stomach and patients report no restriction to food intake .

as explained previously the poor weight loss outcomes in patients with ggf cannot be explained by food flowing through the remnant stomach see argu- ments 2  4. based on these observations we conclude that there is nothing special about the rearrangement of the gut in rygb that intrinsically stimulates weight loss.second it has been suggested that morphological or neuronal entero-plasticity of the gut after surgery could be driving the weight loss efficacy .

furthermore any neuronal entero-plasticity in rygb should alsobe present in ggf cases or djb suggesting that neuronal adaptation to gut rearrangement is not the driver of weight loss for rygb.discussionpossible molecular mechanism of actionwe hypothesize that farnesoid x receptor fxr antagonism in the ileum and colon secondary to the altered microbial function may play a role in bringing about the weight loss effect of rygb.

here we propose that rygb leads to weight loss primarily by inducing a functional shift in the gut micro- biome manifested by a relative expansion of aerobic bacteria numbers in the colon.

rygb leads to profound and sustained weight loss  30 of bodyweight and remission of diabetes in majority of patients.

in fact most rodent models of rygb increase their food intake to match levels of obese sham controls within 1-2 weeks post-surgery while sustaining their drastic weight loss .

genetic knockout of mc4r completely abol- ishes the weight loss effect of the surgery in mice which would not be expected if rygb efficacy simply relied on mechanical restric- tion of food intake or malabsorption .

in humans caloric restriction induces hunger and a profound drop in basal metabolic rate because the body normally defends against weight loss .
