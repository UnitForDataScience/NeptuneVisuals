moreover most oral microbiologic studies were based on pooled samples - rather than characterizing potential differences in microbial composition between teeth and discrete sites on teeth that could influence interpre- tation of results.limited dental microbiome high-throughput dna sequencing studies have already pro- vided initial basic information on biofilm composition but not the full microbial profiles of oral biofilms -.

it has been shown that the human oral microbiota plays an important role in the health status of the host as the oral cavity contains hundreds of different bacterial species .

streptococcus mutans was detected on all sur- faces in all patients while streptococcus sobrinus was detected only in three patients mean relative abundances 7.1 and 0.6 respectively.

for example in each patient biofilm from sound surfaces showed highest abundances of granulicatella paradiacens streptococcus sp.str.c300 and streptococcus sp.oraltaxon064 while veillonella sp.oraltaxone53 was highly abundant on surfaces with awsl.

a recent microbiome study performed on saliva samples from adults with dental caries reported that two bacterial taxa streptococcus salivarius and solobacterium moorei and three bacterial clusters streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sp.

given our unique approach it is difficult to compare our results to previous studies which relied on different technologies and pooled samples.both healthy and diseased sites showed high relative abundances of streptococcus mutans and low abundance of streptococcus sobrinus.

efforts to control it have been invigorated by an increasing knowledge of the oral microbiome composition.
