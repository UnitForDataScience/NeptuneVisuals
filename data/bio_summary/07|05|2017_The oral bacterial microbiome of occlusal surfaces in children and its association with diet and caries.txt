A recent microbiome study performed on saliva samples from adults with dental caries reported that two bacterial taxa Streptococcus salivarius and Solobacterium moorei and three bacterial clusters Streptococcus parasanguinis I and II and sp.

may also play important roles in caries initiation and biofilm community interactions.Our results involving surface diagnosis diet and bacterial diversity supported the ecological plaque hypothesis and the influence of dietary habits on bacterial diversity .

Nevertheless dental caries remains a significant health issue among children worldwide not restricted only to low income areas.An important contributing factor for the high caries prevalence in our studied population is the high consumption of sugars and starch separated from main eating events such as lunch and dinner contributing to acceleration of biofilm formationmaturation and acid production as classically shown by Loesche  and a decrease in bacterial microbiome diversity.

High consumption of ferment- able carbohydrates and sound surfaces were associated with a reduction in bacterial diversity.National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIH grant P30 DK34987.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.PCoA plots displayed differences in bacterial community profiles between sound and dis- eased surfaces.

Researchers are currently able to assess microbiome composition by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing at the genus level with regard to the dominant genera however the capability to accurately classify reads at the species level which is essential when comparing bacterial taxa according to caries experience has been lim- ited.
