Loss could have occurred prior to chemical fixation during the fixation process itself washing steps or during the subsequent staining.Since sample cryo-sections are normally warmed to 4C for post-sectioning fixation cryo- immobilization would have been lost during the warming.

Regard- ing the suggestion that PFA fixation results in dehydration of the mucus layer and its loss or collapse to  1 mm  we note that dehydration also occurs during embedment of Car- noy-fixed material in paraffin and that recent investigation of the colonic mucus layer using Carnoy fixation suggests that the observation of a thin film of mucus on the order of 1 mm coating tissue may not in fact be an artifact of fixation but may represent the natural state of the mucus layer in regions of the colon where a fecal pellet is not present .A variety of epitopes or properties of the mucus layer and the microbiota may be of signifi- cance biologically.

Several authors report that fixation in aqueous fixatives such as formaldehyde results in collapse or loss of the mucus layer and suggest that fixation in the non-aqueous Carnoy or methacarn solution is essential for mucus preservation -.

Qualitatively the general appearance of the mucus was variable and could be eitherSimultaneous visualization of mucus FISH-reactive microbes host tissue and ingested food with Carnoy fixation and with PFA fixation.

Our results  showed that fluorescent signals from FISH probe-labeled bacterial cells after PFA fixation were comparable to those after Carnoy fixation and that the FISH procedure was also compatible with visualization of mucus.Application of the improved protocol to gnotobiotic mouse gutTo illustrate the utility of the optimized embedment protocol we applied it to gnotobiotic mouse gut colonized by two human gut taxa one from the phylum Bacteroidetes and one from the phylum Firmicutes.

If an investigator intends to address a question of three-dimensional spatial organization of a microbial community however our work indicates that methacrylate embedment is preferable to paraffin or cryosectioning.We showed that when intact gut segments are fixed and embedded in methacrylate both Carnoy fixation and PFA fixation are capable of preserving gross morphological features of the sample including microbes ingested food particles and mucus.

This finding is consistent with several reports in which mucus was visualized following PFA fixation and cryosectioning  but contrasts with other reports - that the use of PFA fixation leads to complete loss of the mucus layer or its collapse to a layer only about 1 mm thick.

Thus a widely used protocol is to process gut samples by Carnoy fixation followed by paraffin embedding and sec- tioning.

Other authors however report that the use of organic solvents during the paraffin clearing step results in extraction of portions of the mucus layer and instead recommendfreezing in Optimal Cutting Temperature OCT compound and cryosectioning followed by fixation in formalin for optimal preservation of mucus .

To prevent the loss of intestinal contents as well as sections themselves during fixation and labeling some sections were coated with agarose by touching the surface of the slide on which the section was adhered to molten 0.5 low melting point agarose IB70051 IBI Scientific Peosta IA.
