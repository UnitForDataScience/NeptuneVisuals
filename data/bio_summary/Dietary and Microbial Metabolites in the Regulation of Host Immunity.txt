Of note these lipid metabolites are detected not only in the intestinal lumen but also in the serum suggesting that these microbial lipid metabolites act both in the intestinal lumen and elsewhere in the body.Administration of 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid one of the microbial lipid metabolites has been reported to ameliorate experimental colitis by enhancing tight junctions on epithelial cells.

In this review we describe how dietary and microbial metabolites modulate host immunity.Keywords microbiome metabolite fatty acid vitaminINTRODUCTIONMucosal surfaces especially that of the gastrointestinal tract are constantly exposed to a wide variety of antigens including trillions of bacteria and fungi as well as dietary components and their metabolites.

In agreement with the importance of energy metabolism in immune system mice maintained on diets lacking the vitamin B complex show impaired immunity     .In addition to their direct effects on immune cells and energy metabolism microbial metabolites of some B vitamins act as ligands for immune cells especially mucosal-associated invariant T MAIT cells.

Understanding the integrated mechanisms by which diet microbiota and metabolites influence the function of the immune system would be an interesting topic for future study that could provide new strategies for the control of immune and infectious diseases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAll authors listed have made a substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis review article contains results obtained from our studies that were supported at least in part by grants from the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology Program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development HK by the Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology of Japan Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research S HK 23229004 for Scientific Research B JK 26293111 for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas JK 16H01373 for Young Scientists B NS 17K17686 and for a JSPS Research Fellow NS 17J07480 by the Practical ResearchProject for Allergic Diseases and Immunology Research on Allergic Diseases and Immunology and for the Research on Development of New Drugs Adjuvant Database Project from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development AMED JK and HK and by the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare MHLW JK by the Science and Technology Research Promotion Program for Agriculture Forestry Fisheries and Food Industry JK and by the Astellas Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders JK the Public Health Research Foundation for Public Health Science NS the Terumo Foundation for Life Science and Arts JK and the Suzuken Memorial Foundation JK.REFERENCESAre A.
