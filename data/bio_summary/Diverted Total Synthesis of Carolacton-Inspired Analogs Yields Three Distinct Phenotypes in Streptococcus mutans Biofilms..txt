these findings demonstrate that our analogs can potentially control s. mutans growth at discrete points in biofilm maturation.the composition of the genome and proteome of a growing biofilm is constantly fluctuating.having the ability to arrest the growth at a specific point of the biofilm formation will allow for more in-depth studies on how biofilms grow thus providing snapshots of potential targets present only briefly in the biofilm lifecycle.

herein we report the dts of 16 simplified carolacton-inspired analogs that have resulted in the discovery of three independent biofilm phenotypes 1 inhibition of their formation 2 inhibition of their maturation and 3 acid-mediated cell death during formation akin to carolacton by an analog coined carylacton.our first generation dts library focused on not only conserving the connectivity and stereochemistry of the 12- membered macrolactone but also significantly simplifying the carolacton side chain by introducing an aryl moiety.

as we expected d4 and carolacton were both inactive however we serendipitously discovered that compounds c3 and c4 inhibited biofilm adherence a. we quantified their activity by measuring the concentration at which 50 inhibition of biofilm formation mbic50 occurs and found it to be 63 and 500 mm respectively see for details.

carolacton is a natural product that displays remarkablebioactivity against the pathogen streptococcus mutans whereby it does not affect the viability of planktonic bacteria but instead causes acid-mediated cell death during biofilm formation at low nanomolar concentration .

s. mutans plays a significant role in human health as it is the causative agent in the formation of dental caries the single most common childhood chronic disease.recently wagner-dobler showed that dental composites impregnated with carolacton couldthis exquisite bioactivity of carolacton has drawn the interest of the synthetic community as a number of groups have targeted the natural product.kirschning in particular has been quite prolific as they have disclosed both the first total synthesis and uncovered useful information regarding the structure-activity relationship sar by analog synthesis .
