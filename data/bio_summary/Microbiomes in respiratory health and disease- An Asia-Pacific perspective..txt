The respiratory microbiome is domi- nated by the same major phyla as the GI microbiome including Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria but with different relative abundances and a reduced total bacterial burden.8-15 The lower respiratory micro- biome is frequently compared to that of surrounding sites for microbial entry into the lungs such as the upper respiratory tract oral cavity and upper GI tractCorrespondence Philip M.

However a healthy state can be restored in these mice by inoculation with resi- dent GI microbes such as through faecal transfer.518 While germ-free mice are an extreme case factors such as age diet and antibiotic use have been shown to maintain or impact the risk and outcomes of disease through alterations to microbiome composition.1920 Conversely the onset of disease may cause microbial dysbiosis at either local or distant body sites which may in turn contribute to promoting the pathogenesis of disease.Patients with chronic respiratory disease are two to three times more likely to have GI issues while over half of inflammatory bowel disease IBD patients dis- play pulmonary involvement.21-23 These peripheral manifestations of disease highlight the immunological crosstalk between these two mucosal sites termed the 'gut-lung axis' whereby the immunological health of the gut impacts upon the health of the lung.23 The GI and respiratory microbiomes are thought to play a major role in this axis as both are altered in chronic respiratory diseases including COPD82425 asthma141526 and cystic fibrosis CF.827 This may involve the activa- tion of inflammasomes microRNAs and numerous other factors.28-31 In disease similar selective pressures caused by conditions in the local environment may occur at both sites resulting in similar but not identi- cal changes to microbiome composition.

Despite this the microbiome composition in the community is strongly context dependent and heavily influenced by geographic location.5961Oral microbiome studies in the Asia-Pacific region have uncovered additional ethnogeographic differences among Japanese and Koreans that were correlated with susceptibility to periodontitis.62 Furthermore metage- nomic analysis of Chinese subjects provided a clear demonstration of the influence of plaque microbiota on gingival inflammation.46 Intriguingly oral salivary and gut microbiomes of Chinese patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis--an autoimmune conditionwith respiratory manifestations--were significantly altered compared to controls.444563 Thus changes in the gut microbiome related to local diets geography or other environmental effects in the Asia-Pacific may induce changes in physiology at distal body sites or vice versa including the lung and thus contribute to respiratory disease.2349 As such studies of the gut and oral microbiota performed in our region improve our understanding of the development and progression of respiratory diseases that afflict populations in this region and contribute to global understanding.

Understanding resulting conse- quences for infection immunity and inflammation in the lung using such approaches is an important first step and intervention during early life may therefore have greater impacts on respiratory disease outcomes and prevention as one ages.CONCLUSIONSIt is now clear that changes in respiratory microbiomes accompany respiratory diseases and these changes arecurrently being catalogued.

This includes a recent Korean monozygotic twin study that shows the complex interaction between host and microbiome.52 Other factors such as nutritional status and cigarette smoking--a key causative agent for chronic respiratory disease--have been shown to directly influence the microbiome in India China and Korea.475354 Socioeconomic status and urbanization were also important predictors of microbiome compo- sition in Malaysia Thailand and Russia.485155 In an analysis of bacterial gut diversity in school-aged chil- dren from five Asia-Pacific countries Nakayama et al.

Further its influ- ence on the immune system likely underpins many facets of airway inflammation and infection that evolve with age and immunosenescence.49115116 The emerging role of the microbiome in shaping our immune system and its loss of function with age may provide a context for understanding the impact of age-associated immunose- nescence and 'inflamm-ageing' on respiratory diseases such as COPD late-onset asthma and pulmonary fibro- sis.49116117 The most extensive investigation of age-related effects on the pulmonary microbiome has been per- formed in CF patients revealing a decline in lung micro- biome diversity with both age and lung function.118 However an authoritative metagenomic analysis of age as a predictor of the human airway microbiome in healthy subjects such as that performed by Yatunenko et al.

To date few if any investigations have simultaneously charac- terized both the GI and pulmonary microbiomes in res- piratory disease and so direct comparisons are difficult.The GI microbiome affects the risk andor outcomes of experimental respiratory infections and chronic res- piratory disease through the modulation of pulmonary immune responses.2032-35 It has also been implicated in GI pathology following pulmonary infection with immune cells migrating from the lungs causing micro- bial dysbiosis and subsequently aberrant immune responses.36 While the influence of the respiratory microbiome on immune responses is less well charac- terized it may act as a reservoir for infections caused by Proteobacteria e.g.

All these factors are of increasing importance in the Asia-Pacific region and have the potential to significantly alter the gut and lung microbiomes.11434765 In addition other diseases that are specific to the Asia-Pacific such as diffuse pan-bronchiolitis are also likely to involve an alteration in microbiomes although this remains to beinvestigated from a metagenomic perspective.69 Given the indication of macrolides as therapeutics in this dis- ease an analysis of the microbiota in macrolide-treated patients would be of interest and may reveal parallels with the remodeling of the microbiota seen in macrolide-treated bronchiectasis.6770 The investigation of these Asia-Pacific respiratory health issues on a larger-scale particularly with the power of metage- nomic studies will provide greater insight into the phe- notype of respiratory disease observed in this region.PAST AND PRESENT PERSPECTIVE ON EVOLUTION OF THE MICROBIOMERespiratory and gut microbiomes in healthThe microbiome has been implicated in several aspects of health including acting as a direct competitor for pathogens instructing the development of the immune system and the production of beneficial metabolites e.g.

It is distinct from the microbiota found within the oral cav- ity upper respiratory tract or nasal cavity the most likely sites of microbial entry to the lungs and is most similar to oral microbiomes.1011Respiratory and gut microbiomes in disease Many studies now show that a change in composition of respiratory and gut microbiomes and dysbiosis is associated with disease.
