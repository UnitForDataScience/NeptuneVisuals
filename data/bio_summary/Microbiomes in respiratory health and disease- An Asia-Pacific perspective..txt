despite this the microbiome composition in the community is strongly context dependent and heavily influenced by geographic location.5961oral microbiome studies in the asia-pacific region have uncovered additional ethnogeographic differences among japanese and koreans that were correlated with susceptibility to periodontitis.62 furthermore metage- nomic analysis of chinese subjects provided a clear demonstration of the influence of plaque microbiota on gingival inflammation.46 intriguingly oral salivary and gut microbiomes of chinese patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis--an autoimmune conditionwith respiratory manifestations--were significantly altered compared to controls.444563 thus changes in the gut microbiome related to local diets geography or other environmental effects in the asia-pacific may induce changes in physiology at distal body sites or vice versa including the lung and thus contribute to respiratory disease.2349 as such studies of the gut and oral microbiota performed in our region improve our understanding of the development and progression of respiratory diseases that afflict populations in this region and contribute to global understanding.

cigarette smok- ing is the strongest risk factor for developing copd as well as crohn's disease.23 indeed it is broadly accepted that copd is associated with intestinal manifestations such as decreased gut integrity and nutritional absorp- tivity.2389 although there are few studies copd patients have been shown to have altered lung micro- biota compared to healthy smokers8 and one study has shown that cigarette smoking itself affects the composi- tion of gut microbiota.90 air pollution also has effects on the respiratory system and exposure is associated with lung cancer copd and asthma exacerbations.91 while the association of air pollution to the microbiota has not been widely studied ingested particulate mat- ter has been shown to alter the faecal microbiota and increase intestinal inflammation in mice9293 and a small study of sputum microbiota from never-smokers residing in two regions within the same chinese county revealed different microbial profiles associated with the two types of coal burned in those locations.65 these strong associative links between smoke- and pollution- induced changes to the gut and lung microbiome and respiratory disease warrant further investigation.

this view advocates for the development of narrow-spectrum antibacterial agents that are less likely to disturb the ecology of the core microbiota or promote the transfer of resistance genes across bacte- rial species.ageing and the microbiomeas we age so do our microbiota promoting change within it.109110 in the gut transition from a variable to stable microbiome occurs in the first 3 years of life.59 during this period our immune system interacts with and is likely influenced by commensal microbes.111 interactions with such commensals are essential for normal immune development and have key roles in the development of a healthy immune system in later life.58 this is reflected in animal studies where disrup- tion of gut microbiota leads to subsequent inflamma- tory airway disease.112113 this translates well to human studies where reduced gut diversity in early lifepredicts subsequent development of asthma in school children.114during ageing the alterations in our microbiomes closely correlate with increases in pro-inflammatory markers particularly in the elderly including tnf-a il-6 il-8 and c-reactive protein.

all these factors are of increasing importance in the asia-pacific region and have the potential to significantly alter the gut and lung microbiomes.11434765 in addition other diseases that are specific to the asia-pacific such as diffuse pan-bronchiolitis are also likely to involve an alteration in microbiomes although this remains to beinvestigated from a metagenomic perspective.69 given the indication of macrolides as therapeutics in this dis- ease an analysis of the microbiota in macrolide-treated patients would be of interest and may reveal parallels with the remodeling of the microbiota seen in macrolide-treated bronchiectasis.6770 the investigation of these asia-pacific respiratory health issues on a larger-scale particularly with the power of metage- nomic studies will provide greater insight into the phe- notype of respiratory disease observed in this region.past and present perspective on evolution of the microbiomerespiratory and gut microbiomes in healththe microbiome has been implicated in several aspects of health including acting as a direct competitor for pathogens instructing the development of the immune system and the production of beneficial metabolites e.g.

it is distinct from the microbiota found within the oral cav- ity upper respiratory tract or nasal cavity the most likely sites of microbial entry to the lungs and is most similar to oral microbiomes.1011respiratory and gut microbiomes in disease many studies now show that a change in composition of respiratory and gut microbiomes and dysbiosis is associated with disease.
