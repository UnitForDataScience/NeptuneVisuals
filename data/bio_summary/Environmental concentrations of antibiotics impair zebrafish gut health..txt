The program for the qPCR reaction was 94 oC for 3 min 40 cycles at 94 oC for 6 s and 60 oC for 30 s. The melting curves for the amplified productswere generated to ensure the specificity of assays at the end of each PCR.

The po- tential health risk of antibiotic residues in water should be evaluated in the future.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionAntibiotics are natural or synthetic drugs with the capacity to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria.

The concentrations of these anti- biotics vary in different places or seasons.

The geometric mean concentration of OTC in Tha Chin River was 220 ngL in the dry season and 500 ngL in the wet season.

The mean concentration of OTC in water from the Hailing Bay Region was found to be 417.76 ngL with a maximum concentration of 15.16 mgL  Table S1.Similar to other antibiotics the risk assessment for these two antibiotics and their effect on aquatic animals is mainly obtained from acute toxicological research studies.

The water temperature and pH were kept at 26 - 2 oC and pH 6.8e7.5respectively.

The weight of the fish in each tank was recorded during the experiment and the quantity of feed was adjusted correspondingly.

The duration of the experiment lasted for six weeks.

The OCR of zebrafish was measured at the end of the experiment using a Strathkelvin Instrument 782 Oxygen Meter Strathkelvin Instruments Limited North Lanarkshire Scot- land UK.

The experiments were repeated three times with indepen- dent samples.
