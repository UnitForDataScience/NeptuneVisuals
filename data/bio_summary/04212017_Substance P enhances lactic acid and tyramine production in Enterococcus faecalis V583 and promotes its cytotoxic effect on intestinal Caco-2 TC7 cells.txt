Black untreated bacteria dark grey E. faecalis V583 exposed to 10-6 M SP light grey E. faecalis V583 exposed to 10-4 M SP P  0.01 versus untreated bacteria.

The putative binding site of SP in E. faecalis is now under investigation in our labora- tory and the preliminary results showed that Ef-Tu wouldScanning electron microscopy SEM108 CFUml bacterial suspension was incubated with 10-4 M of SP in phosphate buffered saline PBS for 2 h. At the end of incubation the bacteria were washed with PBS and fixed on coverslips with 1 glutaraldehyde in0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.3 for 2 h. Afterwashing with Milli-Q water bacteria were dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentration 50 70 95 and 100.

Simi- larly our MIC analysis showed no antibacterial activity of SP against E. faecalis V583 even for a high concentrationof 1000 ugml 7 x 10-4 M. However confocal micros- copy using LIVEDEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Assay revealed some dead cells for SP 10-4 M and the bacteria seem to slightly agglutinate which was then con- firmed by SEM microscopy.SP is a cationic antimicrobial peptide that may kill bacteria by pore formation andor probably also act as a metabolic inhibitor .

Moreover confocal observations showed that bacteria seem to slightly agglutinate when exposed to 10-4 or 10-2 M SP compared to untreated bacteria and bacteria exposed to 10-6 M. SEM analysis con- firmed these observations.

Indeed a recent study showed that commensal strains of E. fae- calis generally protect the gut by producing pheromone peptides that can kill MDR E. faecalis V583 .The opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis has extraordinary capacities to grow under adverse conditions and to colonize and survive in a large range of ecological niches including in macrophages -.

This allows us to hypothesize that SP in the gastrointestinal tract may pro- mote adhesion of E. faecalis andor other gut microbes to the mucosa.As E. faecalis V583 is known to be an opportunistic pathogen we examined some virulence properties ofthe bacteria following SP exposure.

Unexpectedly the translocation assay show that even before the decrease in TER E. faecalis V583 has moved from the apical to basolateral compart- ment and 100 times more bacteria exposed to SP crossed the epithelial barrier than untreated bacteria.

To a certain extent in our study aggregation of E. faecalis V583 may protect the bacteria from SP but conversely in some cases aggregationagglu- tination of bacteria is also known to be inherent of the mechanism of action of some antimicrobial peptides  .
