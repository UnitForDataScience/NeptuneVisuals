moreover confocal observations showed that bacteria seem to slightly agglutinate when exposed to 10-4 or 10-2 m sp compared to untreated bacteria and bacteria exposed to 10-6 m. sem analysis con- firmed these observations.

a. the results show that ter decreased more rapidly at 18 h of infec- tion if the bacteria were exposed to sp -53 - 1 com- pared to infection with untreated bacteria -38 - 0.5. after 24 h of infection caco-2tc7 cells were damaged in both cases there is no longer any statistically signifi- cant difference.

unexpectedly the translocation assay show that even before the decrease in ter e. faecalis v583 has moved from the apical to basolateral compart- ment and 100 times more bacteria exposed to sp crossed the epithelial barrier than untreated bacteria.

simi- larly our mic analysis showed no antibacterial activity of sp against e. faecalis v583 even for a high concentrationof 1000 ugml 7 x 10-4 m. however confocal micros- copy using livedead baclight bacterial viability assay revealed some dead cells for sp 10-4 m and the bacteria seem to slightly agglutinate which was then con- firmed by sem microscopy.sp is a cationic antimicrobial peptide that may kill bacteria by pore formation andor probably also act as a metabolic inhibitor .

to a certain extent in our study aggregation of e. faecalis v583 may protect the bacteria from sp but conversely in some cases aggregationagglu- tination of bacteria is also known to be inherent of the mechanism of action of some antimicrobial peptides  .

in this sys- tem live bacteria stain with syto 9 to produce a green fluorescence whereas dead bacteria stain with propidium iodide pi to produce a red fluorescence.

the putative binding site of sp in e. faecalis is now under investigation in our labora- tory and the preliminary results showed that ef-tu wouldscanning electron microscopy sem108 cfuml bacterial suspension was incubated with 10-4 m of sp in phosphate buffered saline pbs for 2 h. at the end of incubation the bacteria were washed with pbs and fixed on coverslips with 1 glutaraldehyde in0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer ph 7.3 for 2 h. afterwashing with milli-q water bacteria were dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentration 50 70 95 and 100. dry coverslips were mounted on stubs and coated with 5 nm platinum quorum technologies q150t elex- ience france.

a that untreated control e. faeca- lis v583 appeared green indicating viable cells stained by syto 9. when the bacteria were exposed for 2 h with 10-6 m fig.

unexpectedly a treat- ment with 10-2 m sp led to approximately 50 of red bacteria demonstrating dead cells stained with pro- pidium iodide pi fig.

b can appear in cluster of more than 10 cells.hydrophobicityaggregation of bacteria is often associated with hydro- phobicity therefore the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis v583 treated or not with sp was then studied.

as expected when the bacteria were exposed to sp hydrophobicity slightly increased.lactic acid and tyramine quantificationlactic acid metabolism has been linked to virulence ine.

tyramine was also overproduced when the bacteria were treated with sp fig.

indeed after 4 h of infection 80 - 2 of the cells co-incubated with e. faecalis v583 remained viable whereas only 61 - 1 if the bacteria were treated with sp before the infection.
