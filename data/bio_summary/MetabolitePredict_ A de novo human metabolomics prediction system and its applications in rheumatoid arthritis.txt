we believe that metabolitepredict fills an important need by simultaneous identifying and understanding metabolite biomarkers for diseases understanding how modifiable environment factors such as human gut microbiome are involved in disease mechanisms and by translating metabolomic data into relevant biological knowledge and drug treatments.with the vast amounts of knowledge built into metabolitepredict and it can take a list of genes as input we expect that metabolitepredict can be applied to identify metabolite signatures unique for disease subtypes disease progression as well as treatment response given the involved genes are available.acknowledgmentsrx was supported by the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health  human development of the national institutes of health under the nih director's new innovator award number dp2hd084068 case western reserve universitycleveland clinic ctsa grant ul1tr000439 research scholar grant rsg-16-049-01 - mpc from the american cancer society 2015 landon foundation-aacr innovator award for cancer prevention research grant no.

this step was only performed once and the data were stored in metabolitepredict database and 3wang and xupage 5pmetabolitepredict prioritizes metabolites based on the pathway profile similarity overlap jaccard coefficient and cosine similarity between disease and metabolites.construct genetic and pathway profile for input disease--for gmetabolitepredict the genetic profile for a disease is the set of disease-associated genes fig.

we demonstrated that metabolitepredict has the potential to identify which and how human gut microbial metabolites are associated with ra.another advantage of metabolitepredict is that it can simutaneously predict both disease metaboilte biomarkers and metabolite targeting for disease treatment.

metabolitepredict prioritizes metabolites for a given disease based on the genetic profile similarities between disease and metabolites.

the human metabolomes are affected not only by intrinsic factors such as host genetics but also by many external factors including lifestyle pollutants diet medications exercise gut microbiota and age 3. in addition metabolites are highly heterogeneous and include lipids small peptides amino acids organic acids vitamins carbohydrates nucleic acids as well as metabolites derived from drugs environmental contaminants food additives toxins cosmetics and other xenobiotics 4. since human metabolome is affected by not only intrinsic but also many external factors sample collection storage processing and data analysis is crucial for reproducibility and knowledge generalization.here we report a novel disease metabolite prediction system metabolitepredict that performs de novo prediction of disease-associated metabolites and metabolite targeting therapies via simultaneous integrative analysis of vast amounts of human disease genetics chemical genetics human metabolomic data and genetic pathways.

the system is highly flexible and additional datasets can be easily included.disease genetics and genomics data--metabolitepredict incorporates disease genetics from two complementary data resources 1 the catalog of published genome- wide association studies gwas catalog an exhaustive source containing descriptions of disease-trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms snps from published gwas data 23. currently the gwas catalog contains 22470 diseasetrait-gene pairswang and xupage 4representing 8689 genes and 881 common complex diseasestraits including ra and 95 ra-associated genes and 2 the online mendelian inheritance in man database omim the most comprehensive source of disease genetics for mendelian disorders 24. currently omim includes 15462 disease-gene pairs for 5983 diseases and 8831 genes including ra and 20 ra-associated genes.

for instance pmetabolitepredict has an enrichment fold of 45.8 at the cutoff of 1 which is much higher that the 29.3 for pmetabolitepredict at the same cutoff.metabolitepredict is robust across different disease genetics data resourcesthe only required input to metabolitepredict is a disease name or a set of disease-associated genes.

metabolitepredict complements current clinical sample-based metabolomics studies current human metabolomics characterize clinically significant metabolite profiles from patient samples metabolitepredict contextualizes disease metabolite biomarker discovery with vast amounts of existing system-level genetic and molecular data.

therefore we expect that metabolitepredict would be equally effective for other diseases.the de novo prediction system metabolitepredict is different from existing computation- based metabolite prediction systems 56 which identify disease metabolites based on known disease-associated metabolites and cannot perform predictions for diseases without known metabolites.

human metabolomics is the study of metabolome using patient biofluids and tissue samples in order to find molecular profiles associated with diseases or health status.metabolomics has potential for early disease diagnosis monitoring therapy and understanding disease pathogenesis 12.profiling human metabolome is challenging.

the genetic profile for a metabolite is a set of metabolite-associated genes extracted from stitch 3 gmetabolitepredict prioritizes metabolites for an input disease based on the genetic profile similarity between disease and metabolites.

here we report an alternative approach and developed a computation-based prediction system metabolitepredict for disease metabolomics biomarker prediction.

we applied metabolitepredict to identify metabolite biomarkers and metabolite targeting therapies for rheumatoid arthritis ra a last-lasting complex disease with multiple genetic and environmental factors involved.metabolitepredict is a de novo prediction system.

metabolitepredict is also different from existing computation-based metabolite prediction systems including profancy 5 and metpricnet 6 which identify additional disease metabolites based on known disease- associated metabolites therefore cannot perform predictions for diseases without known metabolites.
