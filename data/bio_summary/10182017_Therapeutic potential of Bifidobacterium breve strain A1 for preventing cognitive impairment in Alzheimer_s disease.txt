ICV infusion of Ab in the rodent brain can mimic aspects of AD and can be useful for developing and evaluating potential new drugs for AD therefore this model has frequently been used as an AD mouse model.

Microarray studies using corti- cal extracts from AD patients have shown that inflammatoryimmune response genes are upregulated in AD patients and animal models of AD.

However since the AD model used in this study does not reflect the usual biological processes of AD such as Ab burden further research is required to investigate the effect of B. breve A1 on Ab processing or deposition in other AD models such as traditional APP-overexpression mouseor recentlyreported APP knock-in mouse.

The mechanism of how acetate ameliorate memory dysfunction in AD mice is one of the important issues to be addressed in future study.Until now no clinically successful therapeutic treatment or drug for AD has been reported to date.

Although we could not explore whether B. breve A1 suppresses Ab accumulation in the present study we demonstrated that oral administration of B. breve A1 to AD model mice not only improves cognitive function but also suppresses the expression of inflammation and immune-reactive genes that are induced by Ab suggesting that B. breve A1 has therapeutic potential for preventing cognitive impairment in AD.

In this study we investigated the effects of oral administration of Bifidobacterium breve strain A1 B. breve A1 on behavior and physiological processes in Alzheimer's disease AD model mice.

We found that administration of B. breve A1 to AD mice reversed the impairment of alternation behavior in aY maze test and the reduced latency time in a passive avoidance test indicating that it prevented cognitive dysfunction.

We also demonstrated that non-viable components of the bacterium or its metabolite acetate partially ameliorated the cognitive decline observed in AD mice.

Together these findings suggest that B. breve A1 has therapeutic potential for preventing cognitive impairment in AD.Alzheimer's disease AD is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease that results in gradual cogni- tive impairment and eventually leads to dementia.

However despite AD being one of the most prevalent neurode- generative diseases in aging societies no clinically successful therapeutic strategies for its treatment or prevention have been reported to date.AD is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau and senile plaques that are mainly composed of amyloid-b Ab.
