Our results showed that the ileal concentrations of lactate and butyric acid and cecal concentrations of lactate and valerate increased with the L. acidophilus supplementation and consequently alleviated the damage caused by C. perfringens infection and restored the disrupted gut microbiota.ConclusionWe found that dietary supplementation with probiotic L. acidophilus increases the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and decreases the relative abundance of pathogens in the intestine of broilers challenged by C. perfringens infection.

Here L. acidophilus supplementation of the diet decreased the ileal Shannon index namely decreased the a- Lactate and SCFA concentrations in the cecum.Main effectsP valuediversity of the ileal microbiota this result can be explained as follows L. acidophilus dietary supplementation made L. acidophilus the dominant bacterium in the ileum.Our results on b-diversity revealed that the ileal microbial communities of four treatment groups were not separated clearly this finding impliesthat chickens shared a core set of bacte- rial taxa in the ileum regardless of treatments.

In conclusion C. perfringens infection andor dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus modulated the relative abundance of some bac- teria taxa and the L. acidophilus supplementation helped to restore the microbial commu- nity disrupted by C. perfringens infection.available from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database accession numbers PRJNA397003.Funding This work was supported by the Natural Science foundation of China .

In the present study we used high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to monitor the ileal and cecal microbiota of individual unchallenged or challenged broiler chickens fed a diet without or with L. acidophilus supple- mentation in a battery cage trial.In our previous study impaired growth performance of broilers increased mortality and intestinal lesion scores after a C. perfringens challenge indicated that an experimental NE model was successfully established and the dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus improved the growth performance and intestinal health of broilers manuscript under review.

All the birds were weighed and randomly assigned to four treatments Control group CTL L. acidophilus supplementa- tiongroup LA Challenge group CLG and Challenge group supplemented with L. acidophi- lus LACLG with seven replicates per treatment.

We also measured the concentrations of lactate and short- chain fatty acids SCFAs in the ileum and cecum.MethodsBirds diet and experimental designThe experiment was approved by the China Agricultural University Animal Care and Use Committee.A total of 308 1-day-old male Arbor acres broilers were obtained from a local commercial hatchery and used in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to study the effects of a probi- otic groups without or with L. acidophilus supplementation a pathogen challenge groups without or with C. perfringensinfection and their interactive effects.

L. acidophilus addition to the diet decreased the ileal Shannon index P  0.05 irrespective of the C. perfringens challenge.

Our current results indicate that the C. perfringens challenge and L. acidophilus supplementa- tion modified the proportion of specific OTUs and these changes were associated with ileal lac- tate production.In general a more diverse microbial community shows stronger homeostasis of the intesti- nal microbial community and resistance to pathogens .
