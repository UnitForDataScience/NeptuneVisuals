the substrate being unstable all the assays for detection are indirect and are dependent on the ability of this enzyme to use o2- beauchamp and fridovich 1971. in this paper the abil- ity of l. helveticus 2126 to utilize 4-mu as a carbon source is addressed.results and discussionsthe effect of 4-mu on the growth of l. helveticus 2126the cultured bacterial colonies of l. helveticus 2126 were observed on the surface of the agar plates.

the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of 4-mu as a carbon source for potential probiotic bacteria lactobacillus helveticus 2126. for this purpose a series of plate assays and infrared spectroscopy ftir were used for 4-mu before and after the treatment with l. helveticus 2126. the plate assays indicated an initial inhibition followed by utilization of 4-mu that stimulated bacterial growth.

2007. lactobacillus helveticus is one of the well-known probi- otics documented for various beneficial activities in human.

they can directly or indirectly influence the health of the host and are also known to affect the meta- bolic profile of the faeces by increasing butyrate levels which in turn induce apoptosis specifically in tumour cells to provide protection against colorectal cancer tav- erniti and guglielmetti 2012. it was also reported that l. helveticus display antipathogenic activity against infectious escherichia coli nagy et al.

2011 fermented milk con- taining l. helveticus is shown to lower blood pressure and can be used as a dietary supplement for hypertensive patients jauhiainen et al.

2005. lactobacillus helveticus is shown to possess immunoregulatory properties by sup- pression of immune cell proliferation yamashita et al.

the colonies were subcultured and examined for the effect of 4-mu on l. helveticus 2126. after 24 h of incu- bation it was observed a clear zone of inhibition.

this was reduced to a ph value of 307 msm inoculated with l. helveticus 2126 suggesting the produc- tion of hydrogen peroxide fig.

colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.comthat the enzyme produced by l. helveticus 2126 is capable of reducing glucose hence prevents the reduction of dns.

this can reduce superoxide radicals present in the solution instead of reducing dns and hence the absorbance gets reduced table 1.ftir spectroscopywhen l. helveticus 2126 was treated with 4-mu it was evident that 4-mu underwent some structural changes.

3. this supports our argument that 4-mu is degraded and utilized by l. helveticus 2126.it has been observed that administration of 4-mu tends to increase reactive oxygen species and thus oxygen stress which is capable of activating the production of antioxidants fang et al.

starter culture is prepared by inoculating a loop full of l. helveticus 2126 ncim pune india agar slant culture streaked by lightly touching the loop to the surface of the nutrient agar.
