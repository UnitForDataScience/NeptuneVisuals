In this paper the abil- ity of L. helveticus 2126 to utilize 4-MU as a carbon source is addressed.Results and discussionsThe effect of 4-MU on the growth of L. helveticus 2126The cultured bacterial colonies of L. helveticus 2126 were observed on the surface of the agar plates.

However further stud- ies are required in this direction to prove its prebiotic potential.Table 1 The 3 5-Dinitrosalicylic acid DNS assay of the prepared glucose stock solution with water and the supernatant100T 755025040003500300025002000150010005001cmFigure 2 FTIR spectroscopy result of 4- methylumbelliferone before treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus 2126.975T 9082575675400035003000 25002000 1750 15001250 10007505001cmFigure 3 FTIR spectroscopy result of 4- methylumbelliferone after treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus 2126.Materials and methodsSynthesis of 4-methylumbelliferone 4-MUSynthesis of 4-MU was done by Pechmann condensation reaction Fig.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of 4-MU as a carbon source for potential probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus helveticus 2126.

For this purpose a series of plate assays and infrared spectroscopy FTIR were used for 4-MU before and after the treatment with L. helveticus 2126.

Lactobacillus helveticus is one of the well-known probi- otics documented for various beneficial activities in human.

It was also reported that L. helveticus display antipathogenic activity against infectious Escherichia coli Nagy et al.
