Once more is known about the interactions between various phytochemicals more informed epigenetic dietary regimens will be feasible.The gut microbiome can also influence these interactions due to metabolite production.

For example preliminary studies from our laboratory show that genistein impacts the composition of the microbiome in mice that have been humanized with fecal transplants from breast cancer patients.Very little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of the TET family of proteins so there is mounting interest in determining the effects of epigenetic-modifying dietary phytochemicals and the TET family promoter regions.

characterized the composition and function of gut microbiome members and actually determined that there was an enterotype cluster that not only had elevated levels of biotin synthesis enzymes but also enzymes necessary for vitamin C synthesis a vitamin that acts as a co-factor in the DNA demethylation process 10.Hydroxymethylation of DNA no longer considered solely an intermediate of DNA demethylationBoth the microbiome and combinatorial epigenetic-modifying phytochemicals influence the prevalence of 5- hydroxymethylcytosine 5hmC.

There have been many advances made on the interactions between dietary compounds and the epigenome and here we explore some of the exciting and emerging topics on the epigenetics diet.

There is an aberrant gene expression due to epigenetic changes in all cancer types so an intuitive and holistic approach to cancer therapy would be to use these bioactive dietary compounds as a means of not only neutralizing epigenomic aberrations as cancer treatment but also as cancer prevention.

Aberrant gene expression can be due to changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation among others.Combinatorial epigenetic-modifying phytochemicalsThere are limitations when considering use of dietary components to treat or prevent cancer.

In a more realistic view of dietary phytochemicals an increasing number of current studies focus on their combination.

Humans generally do not simply eat one food item so combinatorial studies are important to enhance our understanding of the interactions between various epigenomic-modifying dietary compounds.

Common dietary sources of vitamin C include oranges red and green peppers kale broccoli and guava.
