We observed that while an abundant root microbiome member reduced plant growth when inoculated alone this negative effect was alleviated if this Flavobacterium was co-inoculated with other root microbiome members.Conclusions The Trifolium root microbiome was dominated by nutrient-providing Rhizobia bacteria and enriched for bacteria from genera that may provide disease protection.

For a functional understanding of individual microbiome members and their impact on plant growth we began to inoculate root microbiome members alone or in combination to Trifolium roots.Results At a whole-root scale Rhizobia bacteria accounted for 70 of the root microbiome.

The abundant and root-specific members of the Trifolium root microbiome consisted mainly of Proteobacteria and nodule-inhabiting rhizobia bacteria accounted for 70 of the root microbiome.Isolated members of the Trifolium root microbiomeWe isolated bacteria from Trifolium roots of two climate chamber experiments and from plants grown at the nat- ural site Table and characterized a total of 200 cultured bacteria Fig.

One suggested approach for the functional examination of the root microbiome relies on isolating root microbes to build microbe collections The availability of bacterial isolates offers the opportunity for genome sequencing to obtain insights into their potential functions but more importantly the activity of these strains can be empirically tested in host-microbiota interaction experiments.Microbe collections have been assembled -des- pite that the recalcitrance to cultivation of many bacteria taxa--with estimates that more than 99 of soil bacteria cannot be cultured --was often seen as a limitation.

This recalcitrance does not necessarily apply to bacteria of the root microbiome as evidenced by an earlier study of Chelius and Triplett who reported a phylogen- etic overlap of 48 between their bacteria isolate collec- tion and a 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA clone library from maize roots.

Finally we found three genera in the Bac- teroidetes 11 isolates Flavobacterium 8 Mucilaginibac-ter 2 and Pedobacter 1.We clustered the bacteria isolate sequences to the rep- resentative sequences of the OTUs of the Trifolium root community profiles at 97 sequence similarity see Additional file Supplementary methods and deter- mined whether a bacteria isolate constituted an abundant and root-enriched member of the Trifolium microbiome.

As a next step such an indicative observation from cultivation independent microbiome analysis could be examined by testing refer- ence stock bacteria belonging to these OTUs for their abil- ity to suppress pathogens.Reference stocks and microcosms to study functions of the root microbiomeWith the isolation of root microbiome members Fig.

using one bacteria isolation medium and at a sampling depth of 200 bacteria strains we captured close to a quarter of the abundant members of the Trifo- lium root microbiome.

Here we describe the root bacteria microbiome of the legume Trifolium pratense combining culture- dependent and independent methods.
