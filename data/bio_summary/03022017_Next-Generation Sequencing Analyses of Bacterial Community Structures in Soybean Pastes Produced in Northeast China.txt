these massive sequencing approaches have provided profound insights into the roles of microorganisms in fermented foods such as korean rice wine kim and others 2011a botry- tized wine bokulich and others 2012 kimchi park and others 2012 cheese alegria and others 2012 narezushi kiyohara and others 2012 and nukadoko sakamoto and others 2011. in ad- dition this approach was applied successfully to analyze the mi- crobial communities in fermented soybean foods including meju kim and others 2009 cheonggukjang nam and others 2012 and kochujang nam and others 2012b.

this change results in soybeans possessing health-promoting antioxidant park and others 2008 anticancer jung and others 2006 and antidiabetic kwon and others 2009 activities golbitz 1995. for centuries asians have consumed various fermented soybean foods douchi and dajiang in china qin and ding 2007 shao and others 2010 doenjang and cheonggukjang in korea nam and others 2012a nam and others 2012 natto and miso in japan takahashi and others 1995 and tempeh in indonesia hachmeister and fung 1993. while the japanese soybean paste miso is manufactured by artificial inoculation of certain microorganisms such as aspergillus oryzae golbitz 1995 most fermented soybean foods are produced by indigenous microorganisms residing in the manufacturing environment.

interestingly the most prominent 2 families bacillaceae and enterococcaceae comprised more than 60 of the population but showed opposite abundance patterns7.4 times more bacillaceae in spkm and 3.9 times more entero- coccaceae in sphc figure 2 and table 3. when the family-level diversity of spkm and sphc was compared to that of tradi- tional soybean paste in pixian county of sichuan province south- west china the family staphylococcaceae in spkm and sphc showed the relatively low abundance 4.52.5 and 3.6  1.3 respectively whereas bacterial population of pixian soybean paste was dominantly composed of the family staphylococcaceae 23 along with bacillaceae 44 and enterobacteriaceae 14 yan-ling and others 2012.labs are generally recognized as safe and serve as natural preser- vatives by producing various antimicrobial compounds including organic acids especially lactic acid hydrogen peroxide diacetyl acetaldehyde and bacteriocins konings and others 2000. various amino acids produced by labs including glutamate aspartate ly- sine and tryptophan contribute to the flavor of the soybean pastes cui and others 2012. previously zhao and others reported that labs were the predominant bacteria contributing to the fermen- tation of chinese soybean pastes zhao and others 2009. nam and others nam and others 2012a also reported that labs were responsible for soybean fermentation rather than bacillus species.

despite some sequencing errors such as homopolymer errors in pyrosequencing or rapidly dete- riorating 3' sequence quality with short read lengths ngs tech- nologies have been applied to major microorganisms as well as rare biospheres of various fermented foods ansorge 2009 sakamoto and others 2011 bokulich and others 2012 kiyohara and others 2012 park and others 2012. the present study investigated the microbial diversity of soybean pastes manufactured in northeast china using a massive sequencing technique and compared the results with the microbial diversity in korean doenjang.

microorganisms in soybean pastes have been inves- tigated primarily by using culture-dependent and -independent methods because of their decisive roles in the quality of soy- bean pastes that affect nutritional golbitz 1995 functional jung and others 2006 kwon and others 2009 and flavoring prop- erties shin and others 1985. culture-dependent methods used to analyze microorganisms in soybean pastes have revealed that bacillus species including bacillus subtilis bacillus licheniformis and bacillus amyloliquefaciens and lactic acid bacteria lab includ- ing lactobacillus spp.

were predominant in korean and chinese soybean pastes shin and others 1985 yoo and others 1999 liu and others 2012. culture- independent molecular methods such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct cloning of 16s rrna have improved our knowledge about the microbial communities found in soy- bean pastes.

additionally its size of approximately 360 bp is small enoughto restore a specimen of partially degraded dna salipante and others 2013. twenty nanograms of a purified dna sample was amplified using topsimpletm drymix solution enzynomics daejeon korea with the primers 8f 5'- agagtttgatc- ctggctcag -3' and 338r 5'- tgctgcctcccgtaggagt -3' each concatenated with 8-base sample-specific barcode table 2 and common linker sequences tc for the forward and ca for the reverse primer at the 5' end hamady and others 2008. the pcr was conducted in a c1000 thermal cycler bio-rad hercules calif. u.s.a. under the following conditions initial denaturation at 94 c for 2 min 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min.

the pooled dna was amplified by emulsion pcr before sequencing by synthesis using a massively parallel pyrose- quencing protocol margulies and others 2005. sequencing was performed by macrogen seoul korea using a 454 pyrosequenc- ing genome sequencer flx titanium life sciences branford conn. u.s.a. according to the manufacturer's instructions.sequence processingpyrosequences were analyzed with mothur software schloss and others 2009. sequences containing more than one ambigu- ous base call one mismatch of each primer sequence or 8 homo- polymeric sequences were filtered to minimize the effects of poor sequence quality.

however the relative abundance of each phylum differed in the 2 pastes spkm had a 7.3-fold greater abundance of actinobac- teria and an 11.9 lower abundance of firmicutes than did sphc figure 2. previously fermented soybean foods such as doenjang miso and tempeh were reported to contain a high abundance of the phylum firmicutes nout and rombouts 1990 onda and others 2003 nam and others 2012a.

cui and others cui and others 2012 found that t. halophilus was a dominant bacterial species with minor proportions of strains in the genera entero- coccus lactobacillus and pediococcus.

are one of the most widely grown crops in the world and are generally considered as a valuable source of protein and cholesterol-free lipids gibbs and others 2004. the nutritional properties of soybeans are fortified during fermentation by a biochemical modification mediated by microorganisms.

the most important factor affecting the qual- ity of a soybean paste is the microorganisms responsible for theauthors mi-hwa lee and fan-zhu li contributed equally to this work.entire fermentation process which includes degradation of largexc 2017 institute of food technologistsxrmolecules and synthesis of functional secondary metabolites and flavoring compounds hong and others 2004 nam and oth- ers 2012a.

using these methods tetragenococcus halophilus was found as a dominant member in chinese soybean pastes along with lactobacillus plantarum and enterococcus faecium cui and oth- ers 2012. the major bacterial species of korean soybean pastes were leuconostoc mesenteroides e. faecium and t. halophilus kim and others 2009. with the development of next-generation se- quencing ngs techniques various fermented foods have been investigated.

total dna was extracted from each soy- bean paste sample as described previously kim and others 2011b.
