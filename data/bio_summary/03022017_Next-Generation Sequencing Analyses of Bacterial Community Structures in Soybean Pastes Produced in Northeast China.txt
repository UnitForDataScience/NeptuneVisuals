These massive sequencing approaches have provided profound insights into the roles of microorganisms in fermented foods such as Korean rice wine Kim and others 2011a botry- tized wine Bokulich and others 2012 kimchi Park and others 2012 cheese Alegria and others 2012 narezushi Kiyohara and others 2012 and nukadoko Sakamoto and others 2011.

For centuries Asians have consumed various fermented soybean foods douchi and dajiang in China Qin and Ding 2007 Shao and others 2010 doenjang and cheonggukjang in Korea Nam and others 2012a Nam and others 2012 natto and miso in Japan Takahashi and others 1995 and tempeh in Indonesia Hachmeister and Fung 1993.

Despite some sequencing errors such as homopolymer errors in pyrosequencing or rapidly dete- riorating 3' sequence quality with short read lengths NGS tech- nologies have been applied to major microorganisms as well as rare biospheres of various fermented foods Ansorge 2009 Sakamoto and others 2011 Bokulich and others 2012 Kiyohara and others 2012 Park and others 2012.

This change results in soybeans possessing health-promoting antioxidant Park and others 2008 anticancer Jung and others 2006 and antidiabetic Kwon and others 2009 activities Golbitz 1995.

Microorganisms in soybean pastes have been inves- tigated primarily by using culture-dependent and -independent methods because of their decisive roles in the quality of soy- bean pastes that affect nutritional Golbitz 1995 functional Jung and others 2006 Kwon and others 2009 and flavoring prop- erties Shin and others 1985.

were predominant in Korean and Chinese soybean pastes Shin and others 1985 Yoo and others 1999 Liu and others 2012.

In ad- dition this approach was applied successfully to analyze the mi- crobial communities in fermented soybean foods including meju Kim and others 2009 cheonggukjang Nam and others 2012 and kochujang Nam and others 2012b.

Previously fermented soybean foods such as doenjang miso and tempeh were reported to contain a high abundance of the phylum Firmicutes Nout and Rombouts 1990 Onda and others 2003 Nam and others 2012a.

When the family-level diversity of SPKM and SPHC was compared to that of tradi- tional soybean paste in Pixian county of Sichuan province South- west China the family Staphylococcaceae in SPKM and SPHC showed the relatively low abundance 4.52.5 and 3.6  1.3 respectively whereas bacterial population of Pixian soybean paste was dominantly composed of the family Staphylococcaceae 23 along with Bacillaceae 44 and Enterobacteriaceae 14 Yan-Ling and others 2012.LABs are generally recognized as safe and serve as natural preser- vatives by producing various antimicrobial compounds including organic acids especially lactic acid hydrogen peroxide diacetyl acetaldehyde and bacteriocins Konings and others 2000.

Previously Zhao and others reported that LABs were the predominant bacteria contributing to the fermen- tation of Chinese soybean pastes Zhao and others 2009.
