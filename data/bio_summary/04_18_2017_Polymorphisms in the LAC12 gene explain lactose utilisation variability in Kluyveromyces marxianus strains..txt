It has frequently been isolated from fer- mented dairy products such as cheese yoghurt and kefir where it is associated with production of pleasant flavours and other traits Morrissey et al.

Despite the close relationship between K. marxianus and K. lactis there are important phenotypic differences that have particular implications when considering the yeast for biotechnological applications Fonseca et al.

For instance K. marxianus encodes an inulinase enzyme that gives the yeast the capacity to hydrolyse complex plant fructans Arrizon et al.

and it also has the ca- pacity to grow at temperatures of 44C and above both traits ab- sent in K. lactis Nonklang et al.

For example ethanol has been produced from different substrates such as glucose Castro and Roberto  lignocellulosic material Goshima et al.

and Jerusalem artichoke Hu et al.

These are however low-value bulk products and the interest in yeast biotechnology is now to engineer strains to produce higher value products like flavoursaromas or low molecular weight bioac- tives Morrissey et al.

The genetics of lactose assimilation have been intensively studied in K. lactis where it is shown that the LAC12-LAC4 gene pair encodes a lactose permease and a b- galactosidase enzyme respectively Godecke et al.

Therefore it is considered a high-affinity lac- tose transporter and low-affinity galactose transporter in K. lac- tis Riley et al.

Kluyveromyces lactis has also at least one other transporter capable of transporting galactose but Lac12p is the only lactose transporter described Baruffini et al.
