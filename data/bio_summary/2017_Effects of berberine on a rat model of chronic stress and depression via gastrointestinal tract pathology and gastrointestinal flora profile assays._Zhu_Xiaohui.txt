The rats were randomly divided into the following six groups n10group Normal group regularly breeding model group subject to 10 stress approaches according to the previous literature on chronic unpredictable stress low berberine group 40 mgkgday high berberine group 200 mgkgday bifidobacterium group 140 mgkgday and fluoxetine group 2 mgkgday.

Traversing time in the low berberine group 53.80-11.3117 sec was not significantly different when compared with the model group 54.10-10.7647 sechowever the high berberine group 84.30-11.5089 sec was significantly increased when compared with the model group 54.10-10.7647 sec P0.01 Table II.

However the mean weight of the model group decreased significantly following modeling 323.39-19.6040 g when compared with the normal group 440.91-13.1597 g. Following modeling the berberine low berberine 385.11-23.8284 g high berberine 395.67-18.2214 g groups increased their mean body weight more than that observed in the model group 323.39-19.6040 g. Both bifidocate- rium 385.75-21.1776 g and fluoxetine 389.43-25.5993 g Table I groups demonstrated an identical pattern of results as the berberine groups.Berberine significantly increases the traversing time vertical movement and grooming times as did bifidobacte- rium and fluoxetine following chronic stress modeling.

However the high berberine group was notably increased when comparing to the model group 7.50-1.4337 sec P0.01 Table II Bifidobacterium 12.80-3.2249 sec and f luoxetine 14.70-2.4060 sec groups demonstrated similarly increased vertical move- ment times compared with the model group.

Low berberine 41.20-5.3083 sec and high berberine 22.60-4.1952 sec were significantly decreased when compared with the model group 76.60-11.1176 sec P0.01 Table III as that of bifidobac- terium 25.60-4.5265 sec and fluoxetine 17.80-3.2592 sec positive control.Sucrose preference decreases in the model group and berberine significantly increases as with bifidobacterium and fluoxetine.

The vertical movement time of rats in the low berberine group 9.30-1.8886 sec demonstrated no significant difference in time when compared with the model group 7.50-1.4337 sec.

In an open field test the traversing times of rats significantly decreased in the model group 54.10-10.7647 sec when compared with the normal group 114.50-6.9801 secP0.01 Table II.

Similarly vertical movement of rats significantly decreased in the model group 7.50-1.4337 sec compared with that of the normal group 22.20-4.0222 secP0.01 Table II.

In addition rat grooming times significantly decreased in the model group 0.70-0.4830 sec when compared with the normal group 3.70-0.8233 sec P0.01 Table II.

In the sucrose preference test rats sucrose prefer- ence significantly decreased in the model group 55.10-10.03 when compared with the normal group 93.14-4.84 P0.01 Table IV.
