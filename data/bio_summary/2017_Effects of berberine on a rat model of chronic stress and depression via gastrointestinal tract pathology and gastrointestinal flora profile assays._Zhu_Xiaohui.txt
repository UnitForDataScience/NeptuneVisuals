the rats were randomly divided into the following six groups n10group normal group regularly breeding model group subject to 10 stress approaches according to the previous literature on chronic unpredictable stress low berberine group 40 mgkgday high berberine group 200 mgkgday bifidobacterium group 140 mgkgday and fluoxetine group 2 mgkgday.

however the mean weight of the model group decreased significantly following modeling 323.39-19.6040 g when compared with the normal group 440.91-13.1597 g. following modeling the berberine low berberine 385.11-23.8284 g high berberine 395.67-18.2214 g groups increased their mean body weight more than that observed in the model group 323.39-19.6040 g. both bifidocate- rium 385.75-21.1776 g and fluoxetine 389.43-25.5993 g table i groups demonstrated an identical pattern of results as the berberine groups.berberine significantly increases the traversing time vertical movement and grooming times as did bifidobacte- rium and fluoxetine following chronic stress modeling.

these symptoms disappear following the removal of the stimulus 5-8. by contrast chronic stress is a response of body to long-duration uncontrollable emotional pressure and presentation of high blood pressure muscle tissue damage growth inhibition immune system suppression and metal health damage 9-12. the disease has been become a common issue clinically as a result of its complexity 13-15.numerous individuals become plagued with a variety of stresses in day-to-day life that risk damaging wellbeing which if not correctly treated frequently leads to diagnoses of depression and chronic stress 13-18. as a common and multifactorial condition depression exhibits the characteris- tics of repeated attack not only affecting the patient but also having an impact on those surrounding the patient 19-21. the gastrointestinal digestive system is the most susceptible system to environmental effectors particularly the gastrointestinal tract and gastrointestinal flora and it is easily disturbed when subjected to surrounding aversive stimuli 22-26.the present study used a rat model of chronic stress and depression 1627 to investigate the gastrointestinal tract histopathology and gastrointestinal flora profile.

traversing time in the low berberine group 53.80-11.3117 sec was not significantly different when compared with the model group 54.10-10.7647 sechowever the high berberine group 84.30-11.5089 sec was significantly increased when compared with the model group 54.10-10.7647 sec p0.01 table ii.

however the high berberine group was notably increased when comparing to the model group 7.50-1.4337 sec p0.01 table ii bifidobacterium 12.80-3.2249 sec and f luoxetine 14.70-2.4060 sec groups demonstrated similarly increased vertical move- ment times compared with the model group.

low berberine 41.20-5.3083 sec and high berberine 22.60-4.1952 sec were significantly decreased when compared with the model group 76.60-11.1176 sec p0.01 table iii as that of bifidobac- terium 25.60-4.5265 sec and fluoxetine 17.80-3.2592 sec positive control.sucrose preference decreases in the model group and berberine significantly increases as with bifidobacterium and fluoxetine.

low berberine 76.72-5.52 high berberine 78.95-1.92 bifidobacterium 76.79-1.90 and fluoxetine 87.16-3.85 groups demonstrated an increased sucrose pref- erence when compared with the model group 55.10-10.03p0.01 table iv.histopathological analysis of rat gastrointestinal contents demonstrates severe damage following modeling which was reversed by berberine bifidobacterium and fluoxetine.

damage to rat gastric mucosa intestinal microvilli inflammatory cell inva- sion and cell structure became gradually restored to normal in the colon following low and high berberine treatment similar to the effects of bifidobacterium and fluoxetine when compared with the model group magnification x40 x100 and x200.figure 5. gastrointestinal flora profile assay of a rat stomach using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-based polymerase chain reaction.

this technique involves designing a pcr primer according to the highly conserved sequence of the eric core subsequent amplification followed by analysis of the eric-pcr profile to identify the major microflora distribution in gastrointestinal flora 41. in the present study the eric-pcr technique was selected and used to identify the variation of gastrointestinal flora in a rat model following ten stress methods andor drug intervention.

in an open field test the traversing times of rats significantly decreased in the model group 54.10-10.7647 sec when compared with the normal group 114.50-6.9801 secp0.01 table ii.

similarly vertical movement of rats significantly decreased in the model group 7.50-1.4337 sec compared with that of the normal group 22.20-4.0222 secp0.01 table ii.

the vertical movement time of rats in the low berberine group 9.30-1.8886 sec demonstrated no significant difference in time when compared with the model group 7.50-1.4337 sec.

in addition rat grooming times significantly decreased in the model group 0.70-0.4830 sec when compared with the normal group 3.70-0.8233 sec p0.01 table ii.

in the sucrose preference test rats sucrose prefer- ence significantly decreased in the model group 55.10-10.03 when compared with the normal group 93.14-4.84 p0.01 table iv.

for example two new bands appeared in the stomach tissue following modeling at 2000 bp and between 750 bp and 500 bp in lanes 4-6 of the model group results.
