since diarrhoea and body weight loss is thought to be closely related to the severity of intestinal mucositis during 5-fu treatment6 bbg9-1 should be effec- tive against 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis and clinical symptoms.the pathogenesis of 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis remains undefined but several factors including ros apoptosis inflamma- tory cytokines and the microbiota are thought to be involved.7-91213 in particular apoptosis in the intestinal crypts has been shown to be involved in the initial event that leads to the occurrence of 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis.92122 we previously showed that apoptosis can be detected in the intestinal crypt within 24 hours of the first injection of 5-fu suggesting that apoptosis is a critical event for the initiation of 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis.910 in additionsecondary inflammatory responses are believed to occur resulting in the disruption of the epithelial barrier which is induced by apoptosis and hypoproliferation.811 indeed several studies have demonstrated that inflammatory responses such as increases in mpo activity and inflammatory cytokine expression are involved in the pathogenesis of 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis.81023 in the present study we ob- served that the daily administration of bbg9-1 significantly attenuated 5-fu-induced increases in mpo activity and tnf-a and il-1b expres- sion on day 6. interestingly bbg9-1 failed to prevent the initial induc- tion of apoptosis at 24 hours after the first injection of 5-fu.

in these phases reactive oxygen species ros apoptosis and inflammatory cyto- kines are thought to be involved.7 our previous study also indicated that apoptosis plays a central role in the initial event that results in the development of 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis via the production of ros and tnf-a.89 further inflammatory cytokines including tnf-a are involved in the secondary inflammation that oc- curs after the disruption of the intestinal barrier which is caused by apoptosis.1011the intestinal microbiota has been shown to play a role in the development and severity of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.12 dysbiosis has been described in intestinal mucositis induced by cancer chemotherapy including 5-fu.13 indeed several probiot- ics have proven useful for the management of chemotherapy- induced intestinal mucositis with diarrhoea by ameliorating dysbiosis.14-16 probiotics are viable bacteria and bacterial com- ponents with well-known beneficial effects on human health.1718 several types of organisms have been identified as probiotics including lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacte- ria and these served to improve symptoms resulting from dys- biosis.1920 bifidobacterium one of the major components of the intestinal microbiota has been clinically used for the treatment of diarrhoea and constipation.in the present study we examined the effect of bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1 bbg9-1 on 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis in mice especially in relation to its effects on apoptosis inflammatory cytokine expression and dysbiosis.2  results  effect of bbg9-1 on 5-fu-induced body weight loss diarrhoea and shortening of the small intestineintestinal mucositis was induced in mice by repeated administra- tion of 5-fu for 6 days.

these results suggest that daily administration of bbg9-1 attenuates 5-fu-induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota structure.figure 3 effect of bbg9-1 on 5-fu-induced increases in intestinal myeloperoxidase mpo activity and tnf-a and il-1b expression.

effect of bbg9-1 on 5-fu-induced alterations in intestinal microbiota structurenext we examined the effect of bbg9-1 on alterations to the intesti- nal microbiota structure with 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis.

the relative abundances of proteobacteria and actinobacteria were also significantly altered by 5-fu treatment but these responses were not affected by bbg9-1 administration.3  discussion 5-fu is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant tumours but is well known to frequently cause intestinal mucositis accompanied by severe diarrhoea.1-3 in the present study we found that daily administration of the probiotic bbg9-1 significantly reduced the severity of 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis.

we recently showed that antibiotics significantly reduced the severity of intestinal mucosi- tis mainly by suppressing secondary inflammatory responses without any effect on the induction of apoptosis or early tnf-a upregulation on the day following the onset of 5-fu treatment.11 thus it can be assumed that the preventive effect of the bbg9-1 occurs through the prevention of microbiota-related secondary inflammatory responses.the intestinal microbiota was recently implicated in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-associated intestinal mucosi- tis.12 indeed basic and clinical studies have demonstrated thatfigure 6 effect of bbg9-1 on 5-fu-induced changes in the relative abundance of intestinal bacteria.

these findings suggest that bbg9-1 protects against 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis by suppressing sec- ondary inflammation through a reduction in dysbiosis.based on these results we conclude that bbg9-1 attenuates 5-fu-induced intestinal mucositis.

bbg9-1 was administered orally once daily for 9 days beginning 3 days before the onset of 5-fu treat- ment.

on day 7 following the onset of 5-fu treatment body weight had decreased by 6.2-0.9 g from the initial value and the diarrhoea score reached 1.8-0.5. daily administration of bbg9-1 attenuated 5-fu-induced body weight loss in a dose-dependent manner and a significant effect was observed at a dose of 109 cfumouse.

moreover daily admin- istration of bbg9-1 tended to reduce the severity of diarrhoea though this was not statistically significant.

this reduction was also prevented byfigure 1 effect of bbg9-1 on 5-fu-induced body weight loss diarrhoea and shortening of the small intestine.
