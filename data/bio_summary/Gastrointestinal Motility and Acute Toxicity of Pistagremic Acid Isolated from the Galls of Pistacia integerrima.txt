results of the present study revealed marked effect of pa isolated from galls of p. integerrima on git motility test with substantial safety.the acute toxicity test is commonly used to assess the preliminary safety profile of the test compounds in terms of gross behavioral changes and mortality 8 10. pa exhibited significant safety in acute toxicity test.when studied in charcoal meal git test pa caused a dose-dependent reduction in the propulsive movement of charcoal meal and demonstrated strong anti git motility effect comparable to that of atropine sulphate a muscarinic receptor blocking agent.

p. integerrima has been used for the treatment of different ailments such as blood purifier anti-inflammatory and as remedy for gastrointestinal disorders such as vomiting and diarrhea ex- pectorant cough asthma and fever.objective the main objective of this research work was to evaluate the effect of pistagremic acid pa isolated from the galls of pistacia integerima in acute toxicity and gastrointestinal git motil- ity tests.methods compound 1 namely pistagremic acid pa at 10 50 100 mgkg i.p were assessed for their in-vivo gastrointestinal motility test using charcoal screening model.results results revealed that pretreatment of pa exhibited substantial safety in acute toxicity test up to the dose of 500 mgkg p.o.
