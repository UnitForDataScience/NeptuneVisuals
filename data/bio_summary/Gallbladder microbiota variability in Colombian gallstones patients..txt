The pathogenesis of gallstones is a multifactorial phenomenon related to age ethnicity diet gender body mass index family history and metabolic diseases among other factors 2.Bacteria have been implicated in the pathogenesis of gallstones producing high levels of beta- glucuronidase biliary mud and phospholipases A2 3 not only in non-pigmented gallstones where oversaturation of cholesterol prevails but also in pigmented gallstones where there are high proportions of unconjugated bilirubin 4.

The intent would be to establish more objective differences or associations which would allow for expansion of our knowledge of the microbiome dynamics in our population and the related conditions.Knowing the core gallbladder microbiota of a population in non-acute inflammatory conditions is an important issue because some of this bacteria can become pathogenic and there could be no other opportunity to isolate them because microbiota may change as in the gut by the inflammatory microenvironment and previous antibiotic use 41.Acute cholecystitis is a complication of patients with gallstones and although it is considered a non-life- threatening condition it may evolve to more serious complaints like empyema gangrene and perforation 42.

PCR-positive patients.DiscussionGallbladder microbiota is a dynamic and complex bacterial community with variability between populations related to geographical ethnic and environmental conditions which additionally could have important clinical implications in the setting of gallstones patients with acute inflammatory complications.An important finding of our study is the detection of Salmonella spp.

all of whom were female and residents of the Medellin metropolitan area.Conclusions The gallbladder microbiota variability found could be related to geographical ethnic and environmental conditions.Key words Gallstones microbiota enterobacterium cholecystitis J Infect Dev Ctries 2017 113255-260. doi10.3855jidc.8258 Received 15 February 2016 - Accepted 18 April 2016Copyright c 2017 Arteta et al.

These surveys have not considered the gallbladder microbiota and its variability as a possible source for fluctuations in the proposed outcomes these fluctuations could be explained by the antibiotic selection and the response for each specific type of microbiota in different populations.

Future studies may ameliorate these limitations by including molecular techniques to increase knowledge of the gallbladder microbiota in patients with pathologies such as acute cholecystitis and biliary tract carcinomas in Colombia.ConclusionsThe gallbladder microbiota variability found in the current population belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family and comprises Gram-negative bacteria some of which are considered fecal coliforms E. coli Klebsiella Enterobacter Raoultella.Gallstones sclerosing cholangitis and gallbladder carcinoma are pathologies with an unraveled unequal distribution around the world.

A core gallbladder microbiota should be defined and this definition must be related to geographical ethnic and environmental conditions to support the idea that the microbiota is really associated with gallbladder pathologies.
