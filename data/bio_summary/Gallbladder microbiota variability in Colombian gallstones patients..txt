the intent would be to establish more objective differences or associations which would allow for expansion of our knowledge of the microbiome dynamics in our population and the related conditions.knowing the core gallbladder microbiota of a population in non-acute inflammatory conditions is an important issue because some of this bacteria can become pathogenic and there could be no other opportunity to isolate them because microbiota may change as in the gut by the inflammatory microenvironment and previous antibiotic use 41.acute cholecystitis is a complication of patients with gallstones and although it is considered a non-life- threatening condition it may evolve to more serious complaints like empyema gangrene and perforation 42. in cases of acute complications gallbladder tissue or bile for culture are not available and management options agree on supportive care and early antibiotic use but delayed cholecystectomy and percutaneous drainage cholecystostomy remain controversial 43- 46.without results from gallbladder tissue or bile cultures antibiotic treatment is empiric relying on the assumption of the probable local microbiota.

in our study however the isolations are different and may be related to the environmentalconditions and the ethnicity of the population factors that produce variations in the microbiome of many anatomical locations 2021.as in our study most of the bacteria isolated in the cited studies belong to the enterobacteriaceae family and are gram-negative bacteria some of which are considered fecal coliforms e. coli klebsiella enterobacter raoultella these bacteria are ubiquitous in soils water fonts vegetables and contaminated meat products 39. this kind of bacteria colonize the gastrointestinal tract very early in life becoming part of the microbiome 40.high numbers of coliforms in water destined for human consumption correlates to poor water treatment a condition present among in the apartado population and in much lower proportions the medellin metropolitan area.

future studies may ameliorate these limitations by including molecular techniques to increase knowledge of the gallbladder microbiota in patients with pathologies such as acute cholecystitis and biliary tract carcinomas in colombia.conclusionsthe gallbladder microbiota variability found in the current population belongs to the enterobacteriaceae family and comprises gram-negative bacteria some of which are considered fecal coliforms e. coli klebsiella enterobacter raoultella.gallstones sclerosing cholangitis and gallbladder carcinoma are pathologies with an unraveled unequal distribution around the world.

infection develop the carrier stage in which the bacteria persists inside the gallbladder 15. patients who develop the carrier stage can shed bacteria in their feces for months years or even the rest of their lives without signs of infection 16. these individuals are of utmost importance from the perspective of public health organizations as they become reservoirs and 25 of them do not realize they are infected 1718.the isolation of salmonella spp.

the aim of this study was to isolate bacteria from colombian patients with gallstones using standard culturing methods and to identify salmonella spp.

in contrast in apartado located 25 meters above sea level with an average temperature of 28oc 30 under-developed public services and sanitation facilities and an afro- latin american population of 69 2831 the most frequent bacteria were enterobacter cloacae and raoultella terrigena suggesting differences in the microbiota between populations.differences found in our two colombian populations contrast with the results found in other similar studies from other geographical origins.

there have been many studies trying to support the use of antibiotics with difficulties for comparisons in relation to timing choice and duration 47 and disappointing results with respect to benefits symptoms severityperioperative course post-operative complications hospital stays 4849. these surveys have not considered the gallbladder microbiota and its variability as a possible source for fluctuations in the proposed outcomes these fluctuations could be explained by the antibiotic selection and the response for each specific type of microbiota in different populations.
