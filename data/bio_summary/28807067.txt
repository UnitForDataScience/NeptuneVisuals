Accessed March 2 2017.Iterative Fecal Microbiota Transplantations for Eradicating Digestive Colonization With Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae Is It Worth Itrecent review of the literature demonstrated that according to US-based studies the percentage of CPE isolates that could be associated with the community ranged from 5.6 to 10.8.3 We have recently demonstrated the less effective effect of fecal microbiota transplantation FMT on CPE compared to vancomycin-resistant Enterococci VRE fecal carriage.4 Those results are consistent with another recent study5 conducted in 6 patients colonized with CPE and showing an eradication of the colonization in only 2 of these 6 patients.

Bacterial identification of CPE colonies was controlled using matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time-of-flight massTo the Editor--Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae CPE have emerged as a major source of bacterial resistance and their dissemination is a serious public health threat.1 Furthermore those bacteria can disseminate outside the hospital setting.

One hypothesis is that a protocol including iterative FMT separated by a several-day latency could increase the effectiveness of theprocedure.Our objective was to evaluate the impact of iterative FMT for the clearance of CPE carriage in our mouse model of digestive colonization.

Stool samples were seeded on agar media ChromID CARBA bioMerieux France after serial dilutions for CPE screening.

A large study including 34 hospitals in Spain demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients identi- fied as colonized or infected with CPE during hospitalization probably acquired this organism in a nursing home during the period preceding their hospital admission.2 In addition aspectroscopy MALDI-TOF MS Vitek MS bioMerieux.

10evaluate the impact of the composition of the transplanted fecal material on the FMT outcome in terms of CPE eradication.

Overall by consider- ing the placebo effect corresponding to the natural clearance of CPE digestive colonization of mice the iterative FMT series demonstrated a moderate impact on the decolonization kinetics P  .22.

Moreover the uncertainty of the repeatability of this murine experiment in humans must be considered.The iterative FMT allowed the eradication of CPE in 50 of colonized mice which can be considered as a moderately convincing result.

However iterative FMT is conceivable for patients hospitalized in long-term-care facilities or for the residents in nursing homes in contexts of uncontrolled cross-transmission during certain outbreaks of CPE carriage and if the FMT are administered orally.
