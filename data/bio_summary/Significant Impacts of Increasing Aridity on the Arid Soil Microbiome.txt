The modified arid and margin communities then had size and degree values comparable to those corresponding to the original hyperarid network  but the average path length betweenness centralization and betweenness values of the modified arid and margin communities were lower than those of the original unmodified hyperarid community .

In addition network analysis revealed a deterioration in the density of significant associations between taxa along the arid to hyperarid gradient a pattern that may compromise the resilience of hyperarid communities because they lack properties associated with communities that are more integrated.

Aridity class labels H hyperarid M margin A arid as defined in the text.Planctomycetes r2  0.76 with the arid communities characterized by 5- to 133-fold greater RAs of these taxa than the hyperarid locations .

The subnetworkTABLE 2 Network statistics associated with distinct Atacama Desert aridity classes and modified arid and margin communities randomly sampled to a community richness level equal to the hyperarid communityaCommunity richness modified to the hyperarid levelaMedian values are reported for each aridity class.

The arid and margin communities therefore retain higher connectivity than the hyperarid community even when their richness is artificially modified to the level of the hyperarid community.In conclusion the data suggest that the decrease in community connectivity is not simply an artifact of reduced community richness.

Graphical representations for the subnetwork arid margin and hyperarid data had RMT thresholds of 0.82 0.92 and 0.84 respectively.Some network statistics are impacted by community richness and our three climate classes arid margin and hyperarid differ in their levels of community richness.

Evaluation of sites from each aridity class  reveals that the median average path length is shortest for arid communities and longest for the hyperarid communities.

In addition the median edge count was higher for both arid and margin aridity classes indicating that even after adjustment of community size these communities retained more correlated co-occurrences between OTUs than the hyperarid communities.

In contrast AvgSoilRH was low across all hyperarid sites Table S1 and thus represented an environmental variable that explained the unique composition of the hyperarid microbial communities that was more consistent and significant than the presence of nitrates or gypsum.

Co-occurrence patterns in soils have been associated with groups of microbes sharing similar ecological niches  thus the hyperarid island topology may indicate a distinct ecological structure for hyperarid soils in which microbial communities separate into isolated assemblages.
