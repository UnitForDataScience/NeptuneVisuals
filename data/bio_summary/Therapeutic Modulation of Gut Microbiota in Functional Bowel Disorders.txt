In this review the therapeutic benefits and future perspectives of the currently available strategies for modifying the gut microbiota in FBDs are described focusing primarily on irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation.J Neurogastroenterol Motil 2017239-19Key WordsDiet Fecal microbiota transplantation Irritable bowel syndrome Microbiota ProbioticsIntroductionFunctional bowel disorders FBDs are functional gastrointes- tinal disorders with symptoms attributable to the middle or lower gastrointestinal tract.1 These include irritable bowel syndrome IBS functional bloating functional constipation FC functionaldiarrhea and unspecified FBD.1 The FBDs are among the most common gastrointestinal complaints and they are associated with reduced quality of life.23 The pathophysiological mechanisms un- derlying these disorders are still incompletely understood but they may be multifactorial including visceral hypersensitivity abnormal gastrointestinal motility altered brain-gut axis psychological dis- turbances and low-grade inflammation.45 Increasing evidence hasc 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and MotilityJ Neurogastroenterol Motil Vol.

A large number of IBS patients consider their symptoms related to food and two-thirds of IBS patients report restricting their diets.19-23 Many different dietary approaches for the management of the IBS symptoms have been tried over the years.24 There are many mechanisms by which food may act on the gut to cause symptoms of IBS.2325 Among these altered microbial composition and functions of food may be important factors in the development of IBS symptoms.

One case control study reported that IBS patients had higher levels of acetic acid and propionic acid than controls and that the levels of acetic acid and propionic acid were associated with IBS symptom severity.36 It is not clear however if this alteration of the SCFAs wasthe simple result of the diet or the causal factor of IBS symptoms therefore further evaluation of the causal links among the FOD- MAPs SCFAs gut microbiota and IBS symptoms is needed.Although many clinical studies have demonstrated the effect of a low-FODMAP diet on symptoms of IBS the impact of low- FODMAP intervention on the gut microbiota and its association with IBS symptoms have not been well evaluated.

Since recently a diet low in FODMAPs has often been used to manage the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients.84 Fermented milk products which are high in lac- tose or oligosaccharides may be a major source of FODMAPs and are likely to aggravate the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in some people with IBS.Antibiotics in Functional Bowel DisordersThere have been various attempts to treat intestinal symptoms by using various antibiotics.85-87 Finally in 2015 rifaximin became the first Food and Drug Administration-approved antibiotic for the treatment of IBS-D. Rifaximin is a rifamycin-based oral non- absorbable antibiotic that has a strong in vitro antimicrobial effect against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.88 Rifaximin has high solubility in the presence of bile acids and poorly systemic absorption.858990 It may result in inhibition of a broad spectrum of bacteria in the small intestine without a systemic adverse effect.91Many previous studies reported that rifaximin treatment in SIBO and IBS patients had significant benefits compared with placebo.8792-94 In the 2 largest phase 3 trials involving people with non-constipated IBS TARGET 1 and 2 treatment with rifaxi- min 550 mg 3 times a day for 2 weeks achieved adequate alleviation of the global IBS symptoms 40.7 vs 31.7 for placebo pooled P  0.001 and bloating 40.2 vs 30.3 for placebo pooled P 0.001 during the first 4 weeks after treatment.87 In addition ameta-analysis of 5 RCTs of rifaximin for IBS including TARGET 1 and 2 reported that rifaximin was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptom alleviation OR 1.57 95 CI 1.22 and bloating alleviation OR 1.55 95 CI 1.23-1.96.94Although it is generally acknowledged that rifaximin leads to short-term clinical improvements in some IBS patients there are several points to be considered before promoting the widespread use of rifaximin.

Randomized controlled trials RCTs reported that a diet low in FODMAPS effectively reduced IBS symptoms and the effects were comparable with those of the traditional IBS dietary advice.2627 FODMAPs exacerbate IBS symptoms through various mechanisms such as by increasing the small-intestinal water volume through an osmotic effect colonic-gas production by bacterial fermentation and altered intestinal motility.28 Carbohydrates fermented by the gut microbiota cause increased production of luminal gases such as hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide.29 Excess hydrogen leads to luminal distension resulting in increased bloating and borborygmi in those with visceral hypersensitivity.30 An unblinded study found that when challenged with a high-fermentable-carbohydrate flatulogenic diet the frequency and volume of flatulence and other gastrointes- tinal symptoms increased compared with the baseline in both flatu- lence patients and the healthy controls.31 Moreover flatulogenic diet revealed instability of the microbial composition and reduction of the microbial diversity in patients complaining of flatulence where- as healthy controls' microbiota were stable.

Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of altered microbiota through the restriction of FODMAPs in the alleviation of IBS symptoms and its long-term effect on the general health of IBS patients.Dietary fat may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS.39 A sub- stantial number of people with IBS report that their symptoms are associated with fatty food and that they frequently avoid fatty foods to alleviate the symptoms.19213940 In people with IBS the lipid-in- duced inhibition of gut-propulsive motility is up-regulated and the colonic hypersensitivity in response to the duodenal lipid infusion is exacerbated.394142 These effects may be associated with various IBS symptoms.

The in- testinal microbiota involved in bile acid metabolism and increased colonic bile acid exposure may induce IBS symptoms by stimulat- ing colonic motility and secretion and modulating the microbial composition.4849 A significant increase in fecal primary bile acid and dysbiosis in the feces involved in bile acid transformation were noted in people with diarrhea-dominant IBS IBS-D.48 A diet high in saturated-milk-derived fatty acids increased the formation of taurine-conjugated bile acids in genetically susceptible Il10-- mice promoting the expansion of a low-abundance sulphite-reducing pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia leading to colitis.50 There have been no well designed studies however that have investigated the effect of the altered gut microbiota on IBS symptoms by restricting dietary-fat intake.Dietary proteins are also related to IBS symptoms.

Recent studies found that a large number of IBS patients suffer from non-celiac gluten sensitivity.51 Gluten causes IBS symptoms in people with IBS and a gluten-free diet reduces IBS symptoms in people with IBS-D.5253 Gluten generates IBS symptoms thorough altered gut permeability tight-junctional biology and enhanced systemic im- mune responses.53 There is no evidence however of the impact of gluten intake on intestinal microbiota and of its association with IBS symptoms.Targeting the diet and microbiota remains an attractive option in treating or preventing FBDs.

The ingestion of a yoghurt combined with capsules containing B. lactis HN019 decreased the whole gut transit time in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the fre- quency of the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in 88 healthy volunteers with gastrointestinal symptoms.75 There are several limi- tations however the 3 RCTs evaluated only the short-term effect of fermented milk products and could not demonstrate the effect on the bowel habits and the Rome III criteria for FC were not applied before the subject selection.Four RCTs evaluating probiotics in 160 patients who had met the Rome criteria for FC were identified.76-79 An RCT on a fermented milk product containing L. casei Shirota did not show any improvement in the bowel habits or alleviation of the subjective symptoms of constipation.77 Two of the 4 RCTs showed an increase in the number of bowel movements after the treatment with pro- biotics but there was no effect on the stool consistency straining and feeling of incomplete evacuation.7678 Riezzo et al79 reported that a probiotic-enriched artichoke containing Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC 2.1 significantly improved the hard-stool bowel movement frequency and feeling-of-incomplete-evacuation scores compared with the control artichoke.
