In this review the therapeutic benefits and future perspectives of the currently available strategies for modifying the gut microbiota in FBDs are described focusing primarily on irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation.J Neurogastroenterol Motil 2017239-19Key WordsDiet Fecal microbiota transplantation Irritable bowel syndrome Microbiota ProbioticsIntroductionFunctional bowel disorders FBDs are functional gastrointes- tinal disorders with symptoms attributable to the middle or lower gastrointestinal tract.1 These include irritable bowel syndrome IBS functional bloating functional constipation FC functionaldiarrhea and unspecified FBD.1 The FBDs are among the most common gastrointestinal complaints and they are associated with reduced quality of life.23 The pathophysiological mechanisms un- derlying these disorders are still incompletely understood but they may be multifactorial including visceral hypersensitivity abnormal gastrointestinal motility altered brain-gut axis psychological dis- turbances and low-grade inflammation.45 Increasing evidence hasc 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and MotilityJ Neurogastroenterol Motil Vol.

A large number of IBS patients consider their symptoms related to food and two-thirds of IBS patients report restricting their diets.19-23 Many different dietary approaches for the management of the IBS symptoms have been tried over the years.24 There are many mechanisms by which food may act on the gut to cause symptoms of IBS.2325 Among these altered microbial composition and functions of food may be important factors in the development of IBS symptoms.

One case control study reported that IBS patients had higher levels of acetic acid and propionic acid than controls and that the levels of acetic acid and propionic acid were associated with IBS symptom severity.36 It is not clear however if this alteration of the SCFAs wasthe simple result of the diet or the causal factor of IBS symptoms therefore further evaluation of the causal links among the FOD- MAPs SCFAs gut microbiota and IBS symptoms is needed.Although many clinical studies have demonstrated the effect of a low-FODMAP diet on symptoms of IBS the impact of low- FODMAP intervention on the gut microbiota and its association with IBS symptoms have not been well evaluated.

Since recently a diet low in FODMAPs has often been used to manage the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients.84 Fermented milk products which are high in lac- tose or oligosaccharides may be a major source of FODMAPs and are likely to aggravate the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in some people with IBS.Antibiotics in Functional Bowel DisordersThere have been various attempts to treat intestinal symptoms by using various antibiotics.85-87 Finally in 2015 rifaximin became the first Food and Drug Administration-approved antibiotic for the treatment of IBS-D. Rifaximin is a rifamycin-based oral non- absorbable antibiotic that has a strong in vitro antimicrobial effect against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.88 Rifaximin has high solubility in the presence of bile acids and poorly systemic absorption.858990 It may result in inhibition of a broad spectrum of bacteria in the small intestine without a systemic adverse effect.91Many previous studies reported that rifaximin treatment in SIBO and IBS patients had significant benefits compared with placebo.8792-94 In the 2 largest phase 3 trials involving people with non-constipated IBS TARGET 1 and 2 treatment with rifaxi- min 550 mg 3 times a day for 2 weeks achieved adequate alleviation of the global IBS symptoms 40.7 vs 31.7 for placebo pooled P  0.001 and bloating 40.2 vs 30.3 for placebo pooled P 0.001 during the first 4 weeks after treatment.87 In addition ameta-analysis of 5 RCTs of rifaximin for IBS including TARGET 1 and 2 reported that rifaximin was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptom alleviation OR 1.57 95 CI 1.22 and bloating alleviation OR 1.55 95 CI 1.23-1.96.94Although it is generally acknowledged that rifaximin leads to short-term clinical improvements in some IBS patients there are several points to be considered before promoting the widespread use of rifaximin.
