a large number of ibs patients consider their symptoms related to food and two-thirds of ibs patients report restricting their diets.19-23 many different dietary approaches for the management of the ibs symptoms have been tried over the years.24 there are many mechanisms by which food may act on the gut to cause symptoms of ibs.2325 among these altered microbial composition and functions of food may be important factors in the development of ibs symptoms.

one case control study reported that ibs patients had higher levels of acetic acid and propionic acid than controls and that the levels of acetic acid and propionic acid were associated with ibs symptom severity.36 it is not clear however if this alteration of the scfas wasthe simple result of the diet or the causal factor of ibs symptoms therefore further evaluation of the causal links among the fod- maps scfas gut microbiota and ibs symptoms is needed.although many clinical studies have demonstrated the effect of a low-fodmap diet on symptoms of ibs the impact of low- fodmap intervention on the gut microbiota and its association with ibs symptoms have not been well evaluated.

randomized controlled trials rcts reported that a diet low in fodmaps effectively reduced ibs symptoms and the effects were comparable with those of the traditional ibs dietary advice.2627 fodmaps exacerbate ibs symptoms through various mechanisms such as by increasing the small-intestinal water volume through an osmotic effect colonic-gas production by bacterial fermentation and altered intestinal motility.28 carbohydrates fermented by the gut microbiota cause increased production of luminal gases such as hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide.29 excess hydrogen leads to luminal distension resulting in increased bloating and borborygmi in those with visceral hypersensitivity.30 an unblinded study found that when challenged with a high-fermentable-carbohydrate flatulogenic diet the frequency and volume of flatulence and other gastrointes- tinal symptoms increased compared with the baseline in both flatu- lence patients and the healthy controls.31 moreover flatulogenic diet revealed instability of the microbial composition and reduction of the microbial diversity in patients complaining of flatulence where- as healthy controls' microbiota were stable.

since recently a diet low in fodmaps has often been used to manage the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in ibs patients.84 fermented milk products which are high in lac- tose or oligosaccharides may be a major source of fodmaps and are likely to aggravate the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in some people with ibs.antibiotics in functional bowel disordersthere have been various attempts to treat intestinal symptoms by using various antibiotics.85-87 finally in 2015 rifaximin became the first food and drug administration-approved antibiotic for the treatment of ibs-d. rifaximin is a rifamycin-based oral non- absorbable antibiotic that has a strong in vitro antimicrobial effect against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.88 rifaximin has high solubility in the presence of bile acids and poorly systemic absorption.858990 it may result in inhibition of a broad spectrum of bacteria in the small intestine without a systemic adverse effect.91many previous studies reported that rifaximin treatment in sibo and ibs patients had significant benefits compared with placebo.8792-94 in the 2 largest phase 3 trials involving people with non-constipated ibs target 1 and 2 treatment with rifaxi- min 550 mg 3 times a day for 2 weeks achieved adequate alleviation of the global ibs symptoms 40.7 vs 31.7 for placebo pooled p  0.001 and bloating 40.2 vs 30.3 for placebo pooled p 0.001 during the first 4 weeks after treatment.87 in addition ameta-analysis of 5 rcts of rifaximin for ibs including target 1 and 2 reported that rifaximin was more efficacious than placebo for global ibs symptom alleviation or 1.57 95 ci 1.22 and bloating alleviation or 1.55 95 ci 1.23-1.96.94although it is generally acknowledged that rifaximin leads to short-term clinical improvements in some ibs patients there are several points to be considered before promoting the widespread use of rifaximin.

the consensus agreement and the grade of the evidence for the effect of the probiotics were lower in ibs-c than in ibs-d.57abdominal pain and discomfortglobal irritable bowel syndrome or abdominal-pain scoresa meta-analysis of 24 rcts presenting the global ibs or abdominal-pain scores reported a significant symptom alleviation through a pooled analysis with 2001 patients.56 no significant effect was observed however in the per-strain or per-product analyses of 2 to 3 rcts respectively l. plantarum dsm 98435859 b. infantis 356246061 vsl 362-64 a combination product of l. paracasei sub- species paracasei f19 l. acidophilus la5 and b. lactis bb1265-67 and the other combination of b. lactis dn-173 010 s. thermophi- lus and l. bulgaricus.6869a systematic review of 18 rcts involving 1806 ibs patients and consensus voting reported a high grade of evidence for the effect of probiotics on abdominal pain and a good consensus agree- ment.57 the abdominal pain was significantly alleviated in 5 of the 6 rcts in which abdominal pain was assessed as a primary outcome variable but in only 3 of the 12 rcts in which abdominal pain was evaluated as a secondary variable.57 unexpectedly the lactobacillus plantarum mf 1298 strain which had been known to increase the expression of the tight-junction protein through an in vitro study was reported to aggravate the symptoms including abdominal pain discomfort urgency and diarrhea after 3-week treatment in 16 ibs patients.70bloating and flatulencea meta-analysis of 17 separate rcts involving 1446 patients showed a significant effect of probiotics on the bloating scores.56 an international guide through a systematic review and consensus vot- ing reported 70 agreement and a moderate grade of evidence for the effect of certain probiotics on bloating in people with ibs.57there were 10 rcts involving 741 patients who reported a significant effect of probiotics on their flatulence scores.

this study indirectly demonstrated the impact of the diet-microbiota interactions on the development of symptoms in ibs patients.methanogenic archaea a major mechanism of hydrogen dis-posal in the human colon may also contribute to the pathology of ibs.32 in previous studies ibs patients had lower numbers of methanogenic bacteria compared with healthy controls suggest- ing that ibs patients lack the functions for hydrogen removal.1133 methane also induces slow intestinal transit and has been associated with constipation-dominant ibs ibs-c.34 a study with 19 ibs-c patients found that methanobrevibacter smithii is the predominant methanogen and that the quantity of m. smithii in the stool cor- related with the amount of methane excreted in the breath.35 the direct evidence for the role of methane in the diet-microbial interac- tion in ibs patients however is limited thus additional studies are warranted.scfas are the main products of fodmap fermentation but the alteration or effect of scfas in ibs remains unknown.

recent studies found that a large number of ibs patients suffer from non-celiac gluten sensitivity.51 gluten causes ibs symptoms in people with ibs and a gluten-free diet reduces ibs symptoms in people with ibs-d.5253 gluten generates ibs symptoms thorough altered gut permeability tight-junctional biology and enhanced systemic im- mune responses.53 there is no evidence however of the impact of gluten intake on intestinal microbiota and of its association with ibs symptoms.targeting the diet and microbiota remains an attractive option in treating or preventing fbds.

the ingestion of a yoghurt combined with capsules containing b. lactis hn019 decreased the whole gut transit time in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the fre- quency of the functional gastrointestinal symptoms in 88 healthy volunteers with gastrointestinal symptoms.75 there are several limi- tations however the 3 rcts evaluated only the short-term effect of fermented milk products and could not demonstrate the effect on the bowel habits and the rome iii criteria for fc were not applied before the subject selection.four rcts evaluating probiotics in 160 patients who had met the rome criteria for fc were identified.76-79 an rct on a fermented milk product containing l. casei shirota did not show any improvement in the bowel habits or alleviation of the subjective symptoms of constipation.77 two of the 4 rcts showed an increase in the number of bowel movements after the treatment with pro- biotics but there was no effect on the stool consistency straining and feeling of incomplete evacuation.7678 riezzo et al79 reported that a probiotic-enriched artichoke containing lactobacillus paracasei impc 2.1 significantly improved the hard-stool bowel movement frequency and feeling-of-incomplete-evacuation scores compared with the control artichoke.

in previous studies normalization of the results of the breath test in ibs patients after antibiotic therapy has been shown to be correlated with a successful response to antibiotic therapy.86929396 the predictive value of a positive lactulose breath test has been dis- appointing however in selecting patients who will respond.97-99 in a recent prospective study that used upper-gut aspiration culture for diagnosing sibo ibs patients with sibo had greater symptom alleviation than patients without sibo 87.5 vs 25 1 month af- ter the administration of antibiotics.100 the technique of upper-gut aspiration however has limited application in clinical practice due to its invasiveness and expensiveness.

an improved understanding of host-microbiota interactions in fbds is impor- tant not only for its pathogenesis but also for enabling therapeutic modulation of the microbiota.13 the potential therapeutic approach- es including dietary manipulation prebiotics probiotics synbiotics antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation are attempts to modify the gut microbiota.6 in this review the therapeutic benefits and future perspectives of the currently available strategies for mod- ifying gut microbiota in fbds are described focusing primarily on ibs and fc.diet and intestinal microbiotaas the knowledge about the human gut microbiome has ad- vanced the composition of the microbiota has been discovered to have a profound impact on human health.1415 the human gut microbiota is influenced by various factors.

the in- testinal microbiota involved in bile acid metabolism and increased colonic bile acid exposure may induce ibs symptoms by stimulat- ing colonic motility and secretion and modulating the microbial composition.4849 a significant increase in fecal primary bile acid and dysbiosis in the feces involved in bile acid transformation were noted in people with diarrhea-dominant ibs ibs-d.48 a diet high in saturated-milk-derived fatty acids increased the formation of taurine-conjugated bile acids in genetically susceptible il10-- mice promoting the expansion of a low-abundance sulphite-reducing pathobiont bilophila wadsworthia leading to colitis.50 there have been no well designed studies however that have investigated the effect of the altered gut microbiota on ibs symptoms by restricting dietary-fat intake.dietary proteins are also related to ibs symptoms.
