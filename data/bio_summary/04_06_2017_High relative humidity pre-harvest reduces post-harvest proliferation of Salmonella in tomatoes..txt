Humidity-related factors emerged as the most important factors e. In all three experiments high relative humidity the week prior to harvest was consistently associated with less Salmonella proliferation with the breakpoint at 77e80 RH and explaining 1.3e1.9 log10 units of proliferation dif- ferential.

Rainfall was of importance in the irrigation experiment whereas a dew point Huai Huai Huai 15 oC was associated with less proliferation in the nitrogenpo-tassium experiment and a dew point 23 oC was associated with less proliferation in the ironcopper experiment.

Knowledge on the factors affecting Salmonella proliferation on fresh produce therefore becomes increasingly important to safeguard public health.

Previous experi- ments showed a limited impact of pre-harvest production practices on Salmonella proliferation on to- matoes but suggested a significant effect of harvest time.

Across all datasets regression trees confirmed the dominant effect of harvest time on Salmonella proliferation with humidity-related factors emerging as the most important underlying climatic factors.

High relative humidity the week prior to harvest was consistently associated with lower Salmonella proliferation.

A controlled lab experiment confirmed that tomatoes containing their native epimicrobiota supported significantly lower Salmonella proliferation when incubated at higher humidity prior to inoculation.

Knowledge on the factors affecting Salmonella proliferation on fresh produce therefore becomes increasingly important to safe- guard public health.

Different factors may contribute to Salmonella proliferation on fresh produce including environmental conditions such as regional differences climate pre- and post-harvest production factors and genotype and physiological states of the crop and the pathogen .
