in addition to maintaining structural integrity of the intestinal wall dietary fiber intake regu- lates inflammation through the production of scfas as a metabolic byproduct of microbial fermentation  .as further described in the conceptual model below the struc-tural integrity and resilience of the intestinal membrane may be a crucial component to one's neurological health following neuro- traumatic events.exploring the bidirectional gbmax involvement following tbitop-down brain-to-guta recent review explored the extent to which the brain influ- ences the gut following tbi with primary focus on gi dysfunction following tbi .

and therefore perpetual neuroinflammation increases the risk of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease .by looking beyond the confines of the cns and incorporating the gut it is clear that systemic and peripheral influences occurring outside the cns can exacerbate the local patho- physiological response to tbi occurring within the brain including ongoing neuroinflammation .tbi can cause structural and functional damage to gi tract this type of intestinal barrier dysfunction typically leads to increased intestinal permeability increased intestinal permeability is associated with a sys- temic immune response  andthe systemic inflammatory response emanating from the damaged gut will exert influence on the vulnerable and pre- viously primed microglia to further exacerbate neuroinflam- mation .backgroundnew perspectives for tbimost commonly tbi is generally defined as a closed head injury as a result of accelerationdeceleration forces and it is traditionally classified into three categories mild moderate and severe basedon the glasgow coma scale gcs which scores the patient's level of consciousness .

rather there is likely a large therapeutic window to curb this ongoing injury process in order to mitigate chronic damage to the brain and reduce the otherwise heightened risk of neurological condi- tions including depression and degenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte.the following section will provide an overview of this biologicalprocess with an emphasis on the neuroinflammatory response since this appears to be at risk of becoming chronically hyperactive following head injuries and is closely related to peripheral influ- ences from the gut .immunological perspectives of tbi sequelaeglial cells outnumber neuronal cells by approximately 10 to 1 in the brain .

in fact exist- ing preclinical data provides direct evidence in support of this in a model where probiotic supplementation after the neurotrauma significantly lowered the intestinal permeability that was other- wise increased by the damage to the intestinal mucosa following tbi .

more sensitive measures of intestinal dysfunction and intestinal permeabil- ity would be helpful.conclusionthere is extensive evidence highlighting the involvement of secondary injury mechanisms that may occur in the brain follow- ing repetitive or singular neurotraumatic events.

''bottom-up potential gut-to-brain signalingconsidering the effects of neurotrauma on the structure and function of the gut it is necessary to examine the potential influ- ence of the gbmax in the opposite direction how does neuro- trauma induced damage to the gut affect the brain given the local immunological aspects of the sequelae following tbi within the cns could gut barrier dysfunction andor microbiota alter- ations spur a peripheral inflammatory cascade that further exacer- bates the dysregulated hyperactivity of the microglia in the cns initially perturbed by the primary insultwhile this has not been directly investigated we can look to studies that induce experimental endotoxemia by peripherally injecting lps which effectively simulates tbi induced intestinal dysfunction.

prophylactically could measures that fortify the intestinal barrier improve brain resilience amongst those with high exposure toneurotrauma similarly could the same approach improve the brain's resilience by reducing inflammation in order to reduce the risk of neurodegeneration amongst populations with signifi- cant history of neurotrauma clearly more work is needed to answer these questions but we believe the conceptual model pro- posed in this review lays a foundation to further investigate tbi through this integrative lens.fundingthere are no external funding sources for this work.conflicts of interestthe authors declare no conflicts of interest.references.. .. .

despite this void the proposed mechanisms emanating from a damaged gut are closely implicated in the inflammatory processes known to promote neuropathology in the brain following tbi which suggests the gut-brain axis may be a therapeutic target to reduce the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases following tbi.

as a point of emphasis this conceptual model has yet to be directly investigated.closing the loop insights from acute cerebral ischemic eventswhile the primary context of the article relates to the patho- physiological mechanisms of tbi insights may be gathered from studies investigating the bidirectional involvement of the gbmax following other acute ischemic brain injuries  .indeed gi dysfunction is a known consequence of acute ischemic brain injuries .

other observed morphological alterations of the gut mucosa occurring within three hours of tbi include shedding of epithelial cells fracture of intestinal villi fusion of adjacent villi focal ulcer dilation of central chyle duct mucosal atrophy edema in the villous interstitium and lamina pro- pria and a reduced expression of intestinal tight junction proteins e.g.

this same study reports that interventions supporting intestinal barrier function can rescue intestinal permeability deficits to prevent bacterial translocation .

c both the functional and structural changes to the intestinal membrane compromise the integrity of the intestinal wall barrier.

we propose that isolated and remote events gbmax dysfunc- tion later in life could be a source of internal stressors that provoke the previously primed microglia to further predispose individuals to disease .there are numerous and varied examples of isolated gbmax disruptions independent of tbi that could cause intestinal barrier dysfunction andor gut dysbiosis such as 1 mental stresss   2 inflammatory bowel disease which is increasingly prevalent  3 antibiotic induced dys- biosis and 4 even the poor western diet of the average american is reported to promote dysbiosis and impair intestinal barrier func- tion .
