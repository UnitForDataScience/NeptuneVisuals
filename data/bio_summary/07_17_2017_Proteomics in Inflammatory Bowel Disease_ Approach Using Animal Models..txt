these findings suggest that children and adult cd patients may exhibit different immunological responses to the disease manifesting in2270dig dis sci 2017 622266-2276different proteins expression and identifying potential biomarkers associated with children cd onset using proteomics.the statistical analysis of a combination of several specific and non-specific biomarkers of inflammation in- cluding global inflammatory markers intestinal inflamma- tion specific markers and chronic intestinal inflammation markers in the above animal model of colitis allowed the investigators to define a unique protein signature that may be used to discriminate between colitis and non-colitis as well as between different stages of colitis.

in proteomics studies a defined genetic mutation or a defined pathogenesis of inflammation would help decipher the exact proteins produced during a specific immune activation or cascade and abrogate the inconsistent results obtained from human studies most likely secondary to activation of different pathways reflecting the multiple pathogenetic mechanisms for ibd development.animal models of ibd could be divided into four broad categories i inducible colitis models ii spontaneous colitis models iii adoptive transfer models and iv genetically engineered models such as knockout ko models and transgenic models.

on the other hand hp and hpx were increased in both colitis models implying that these markers are non-specific for chronic colitis and may be general markers of any form of intestinal inflammation.

by being able to obtain a large number of specimens from multiple sites and con- trol for confounding environmental genetic and meta- bolic factors proteomics studies using animal models of colitis offered an alternative approach to human studies.

our aim is to review the information and lessons acquired so far from the use of proteomics in animal models of colitis.

recent proteomics research has shed light on some aspects of the pathogenesis  and pathophysiology - of ibd and helped in the search for some biomarkers for disease activity as well as for differentiation between ulcerative colitis uc and crohn's disease cd -.

the most widely used models in proteomics research are the il-10-deficient mice the multi-drug-resistant mdr1a mice dextran sulfate sodium dss-induced colitis and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid tnbs-induced colitis.interleukin-10-knockout il-1022 mouse modelil-10 is produced by t cells b cells macrophages thymic cells and keratinocytes.

as the development of colitis is quite predictable this model can be used to study the longitudinal production of serum and intestinal proteins during various stages of colonic inflammation and help look for disease markers in ibd and investigate the effect of diet on inflammation.

moreover because colitis develops only after exposure to commensal bacteria this model is useful in studying the complex interaction between colonic epithelium and intestinal microbiota.

similarly to il-10-deficient model this model has also the potential to study the interaction between microbiota and ibd pathogenesis as colitis occurs after exposure to commensal bacteria.dss modelthe administration of dss dissolved in water to mice or rats causes hematochezia body weight loss shortening of the intestine mucosal ulcers and infiltration of neutrophils.

this model can be used for both acute and chronic colitis.
