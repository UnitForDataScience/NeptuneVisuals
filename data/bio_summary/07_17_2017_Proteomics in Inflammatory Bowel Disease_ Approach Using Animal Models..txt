These findings suggest that children and adult CD patients may exhibit different immunological responses to the disease manifesting in2270Dig Dis Sci 2017 622266-2276different proteins expression and identifying potential biomarkers associated with children CD onset using proteomics.The statistical analysis of a combination of several specific and non-specific biomarkers of inflammation in- cluding global inflammatory markers intestinal inflamma- tion specific markers and chronic intestinal inflammation markers in the above animal model of colitis allowed the investigators to define a unique protein signature that may be used to discriminate between colitis and non-colitis as well as between different stages of colitis.

In proteomics studies a defined genetic mutation or a defined pathogenesis of inflammation would help decipher the exact proteins produced during a specific immune activation or cascade and abrogate the inconsistent results obtained from human studies most likely secondary to activation of different pathways reflecting the multiple pathogenetic mechanisms for IBD development.Animal models of IBD could be divided into four broad categories i inducible colitis models ii spontaneous colitis models iii adoptive transfer models and iv genetically engineered models such as knockout KO models and transgenic models.

On the other hand HP and HPX were increased in both colitis models implying that these markers are non-specific for chronic colitis and may be general markers of any form of intestinal inflammation.

For example multiple cytoskeletal assembly proteins important for bar- rier integrity including gelsolin GSN and vinculin VCL were expressed at lower levels in the inflamed colon of Mdr1a -- mice compared with non-inflamed FVB mice emphasizing the importance of the gut barrier in the pathogenesis of colitis .Cell Metabolism ProteinsMultiple proteins related to cell metabolism were found to be decreased in colitis.

Curcumin a food additive extracted from the medicinal plant Curcuma longa has been previ- ously found to significantly ameliorate diarrhea decrease severity of colitis and decrease MPO activity in TNBS- induced colitis in mice .

By being able to obtain a large number of specimens from multiple sites and con- trol for confounding environmental genetic and meta- bolic factors proteomics studies using animal models of colitis offered an alternative approach to human studies.

Our aim is to review the information and lessons acquired so far from the use of proteomics in animal models of colitis.
