Alternatively a double filtering separation step has been shown useful to deplete human proteins for selective enrichment of microbial proteins which was demonstrated to enhance prote- ome coverage by facilitating the identification of low- abundance proteins .Next efficient protein extraction from the complex microbial samples is critical to allow accurate represen- tation of the intracellular protein content.

Hence other complementary approaches are needed to elucidate the functional capacity of human gut microbiota.Over the past decade metaproteomics which is de- fined as the large-scale profiling of the whole protein complement expressed by a complex microbial ecosys- tem has been applied to analyze human gut micro- biota.

However it was observed that despite greater microbial protein identifications the centrifugation step caused considerable protein loss due to non-specific re- moval of microbial cells which led to bias in the analysis .

Accumulating evidence indicates that imbalances in the microbial community or dysbiosis have potential adverse effects on human health whereby such alterations are implicated in the development of numerous diseases including metabolic disorders inflam- matory diseases and cancers .Given the importance of gut microbiota in human health and disease development it has been the subject of extensive investigations in recent years.

in which the use of different databases in gut microbial metaproteome data analysis has led to complementary identification of unique peptides More recently a data analysis pipeline coupling publicly accessible gene catalog databases with iterative database searching known as MetaPro-IQ was introduced by Zhang et al.

This problem could be partly alleviated by ap- plying different fractionation and enrichment strategies such as capillary and microchip methods to reduce sample complexity and increase protein detection but at the expense of increased cost and analysis time.Beyond protein identification quantitative analysis is important to determine key microbial players that con- tribute to metabolic functions .
