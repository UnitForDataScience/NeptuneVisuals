as their proportion in semen was remarkably high according to the present study as well as some other studies a similar function might be attributed to them in the male genital tract.1619 semen quality in lacto- bacillus-predominant semen samples is higher than in the case of the other community types15 and lactobacilli prevent sperm lipid peroxidation thus preserving sperm motility and viability.20it is interesting to note that our previous culture-based studies have not revealed lactobacilli in semen samples although we used suitable media mrs agar for them.

this confirms the results of our previ- ous study showing a high concordance between semen and vaginal samples within a couple.25 bacteria that were associ- ated with lower sperm quality did not form a clear pattern however many gram-negative anaerobes were involved.in the case of any prostate-specific material there is an inherent possibility of urethral contamination as numerous aerobic microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria belong to the microbiota of the urethra.26 our research team has compared the communities in semen with that of first-catch urine which reveals urethral microbiota.27 the microorganisms' concentration and the number of species were significantly higher in patients' semen than in patients' urine and these specimens shared only one-third of species showing that most of the semen microorganisms in prostatitis patients orig- inate from the upper genital tract.another related question is the possible contamination dur- ing ngs studies.

for the 16s rdna amplicon sequencing data principal coordinate analysis was used to explore and visual- ize similarities between seminal and vaginal microbiota sam- ples based on the obtained yue and clayton measure of dissimilarity.resultsaltogether 67 men were investigated among them were 21 men with chronic prostatitis 10 men with inflammatory and12 men with non-inflammatory prostatitis and 46 controls.

for ngs the samples were stored at 80degc before dna extraction.characterization of sementhe analysis of semen was carried out according to who guidelines.12 semen volume was estimated by weighing the collection tube with the semen sample and subsequently subtracting the predetermined weight of the empty tube assuming 1 g  1 ml.

clinical data of the study participants are presented in table s2.the most abundant phylum in the semen was firmicutescance level.discussionin the present study we obtained semen samples from healthy men and chronic prostatitis patients and sequenced the 16s rrna gene fragments using a ngs platform.

bacterial communities in semen from men of infertile couples metagenomic sequencing reveals relationships of seminal microbiota to semen quality.

the species richness was higher in prostatitis patients than healthy men inverted simpson index 13.5 - 5.8 vs 10.3 - 4.0.conclusions the semen of chronic prostatitis patients contains fewer health- supporting lactobacilli and has higher species diversity than that of healthy men.

the men without pelvic paindiscomfort complaints and leukocytospermia were included into the control group.exclusion criteria for all men were stated according to the suggestions of the nih workshop on chronic prostatitis and included other urogenital tract infections.11 none of the men had received antimicrobial therapy within 3 months.

in conclusion semen of chronic prostatitis patients contains less health-supporting lactobacilli and has higher species diver- sity than that of healthy men.
