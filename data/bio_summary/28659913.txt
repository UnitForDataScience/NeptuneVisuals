furthermore it was found that the administration of l. johnsonii n6.2 for 8 weeks significantly decreased the expression of cd279 oncd8 tem and cd8 tcm p  0.05 and p  0.05 respectively while a trend toward increased the expression of cd279 on cd8 temra cells was also observed p  0.1. these changes in cd8 tem and tcm cells were sustained after the washout period p  0.05 and p  0.05 respectively .

syndrome scores from the daily questionnaire indicated that cephalic syndrome including the symptoms of headache and dizziness was significantly lower p  0.05 for l. johnsonii n6.2 versus placebo for treatment weeks 2 and 4-8. the gastrointestinal distress syndrome was lower p  0.05 for l. johnsonii n6.2 versus placebo during most treatment weeks and neared significance at baseline p  0.05. interestingly the probiotic group showed a significant decrease p  0.05 in the epidermal syndrome at the end of the washout period .

cd4 t cells showed strong trends toward decreased cd185 cxcr5 and cd279 pd-1 expression levels on naive and tem subsets as a result of the l. johnsonii n6.2 supplementa- tion however these changes only reached statistical significance after the washout period for cd279 p  0.05 and p  0.07 for cd185 p  0.01 and p  0.05 .

a significant decrease of cd185 expression on cd8 naive and tem cells was also observed at 8 weeks p  0.06 and p  0.05 respectively and sustained even after the washout period in both cell popula- tions p  0.05 and p  0.05 respectively .differentiated teff subsetscd4cd45ro tcellswereseparatedinto th1 cd183cd196- th2 cd183-cd196- th17 cd183-cd196 and th1th17cd183cd196.

bacterial communities clustered only by individual anosim r  0.921 p  0.01 and the community structure did not differ significantly by treatment anosim r  0.011p  0.05 or over time anosim r  -0.017 p  0.99. in addition community structure was not correlated with the com- bined effects of treatment and time permanova r2  0.002 p  1.00 figure s6 in supplementary material.

although no significant differences at p  0.05 were obtained two families prevotellaceae and ruminococcaceae showed trends with p  0.1 table s6 in supplementary material while families lactobacillaceae erysipelotrichaceae and odoribacteraceae showed values of p  0.17.after the washout period the observed microbial changes induced by l. johnsonii n6.2 supplementation i.e.

interestingly one family christensenellaceae significantly increased in concentration in the l. johnsonii n6.2 treated group after 12 weeks after the washout period p  0.05 while the clostridiaceae and bacteroidaceae families showed trends to increase or decrease respectively p  0.06 and p  0.09 respec- tively.

of the five domains of the weekly gsrs ques- tionnaire indigestion p  0.05 and abdominal pain p  0.05 were significantly lower among l. johnsonii n6.2 treated subjects during treatment weeks 2 to 8 and during washout weeks 1-4compared to placebo .

after 8 weeks last day of treatment a slight increase in the tryptophan concentration was observed whichcorrelated with a decrease in the kt ratio in the l. johnsonii n6.2 versus placebo-treated group b subjects low to high lab counts although statistical significance was not reached p  0.17 and p  0.13 respectively .

interestingly at 12 weeks after 4 weeks of washout the changes in tryptophan and kt ratio reached statistical significance with p  0.01 and p  0.05 respectively .

the relative frequency of monocytes was not affected significantly after 8 weeks of treatment p  0.1 however at 12 weeks mono- cyte frequencies increased significantly among l. johnsonii n6.2 treated subjects p  0.05  table s4 in supplementary material.naive and memory t cell subsetscd4 and cd8 t cells were divided into naive tn cd197cd45rateffectormemorytemcd197-cd45ra- t central memory tcm cd197cd45ra- and t effector memory expressing cd45ra temra cd197-cd45ra figure s3 and table s5 in supplementary material.

however the most notable changes were obtained in the activated cd38hla-dr cd8 t cells after 8 weeks of treatment p  0.05  as well as in the activated temra subset which increased significantly in subjects treated with probiotic compared to placebo p  0.05 .

the probiotic treatment decreased the relative amount of naive cd8t cells p  0.05 while increasing the frequency of cd8 tem p  0.05. the concentrations of both cell types were similarafter the washout period  table s5 in supplementary material.

interestingly the numbers remained stableafter 4 weeks of washout p  0.05 and p  0.09 respectively.

no statisticaldifferences were obtained between the treatment groups or the time points for il-6 tnf-a ifn-g tnfa and soluble cd25 p  0.1. a significant p  0.05 increase in the concentration of iga was observed during the washout period in the l. johnsonii treatment group while no differences observed in the placebo group .figure 6  expression of cd185 and cd279 on t cells subset.
