The lower levels of this species in the small intestine of broilers could be due to the content of hydrolysable tannins in the sorghum hydrolysable tannins from chestnut were shown toTable 7 Major genera of bacteria found in the small intestine of broilers fed experimental diets at 10 and 21 daysC100 corn-based diets S100 sorghum-based diets CS50 diets based on corn and sorghum 11 PC-S corn-based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases PS-C sorghum-based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn-based in subsequent phases.Means within a row lacking a common superscript differ p  0.05.p-Value of contrasts C100 S100 vs. PS-C PC-S 0.265 C100 PC-S vs. S100 PS-C 0.418 C100 PS-C vs. S100 PC-S 0.088 C100 S100 vs. PS-C PC-S 0.882 C100 PC-S vs. S100 PS-C 0.134 C100 PS-C vs. S100 PC-S 0.263 C100 S100 vs. PS-C PC-S 0.027 C100 PC-S vs. S100 PS-C 0.032 C100 PS-C vs. S100 PC-S 0.060.Table 8 Percentage of the genus Alkaliphilus in the small intestine of broilers fed experimen- tal diets at 10 and 21 daysDietContrastC100 corn-based diets S100 sorghum-based diets CS50 diets based on corn and sorghum 11 PC-S corn-based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases PS-C sorghum-based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn-based diet in subsequent phases.Means followed by lower case upper case letters in the line column differ statistically by Tukey's test p  0.05.Contrast 1 C100 S100 vs. PS-C PC-S 2 C100 PC-S vs. S100 PS-C e 3 C100 PS-C vs. S100 PC-S.have antimicrobial activity against C. perfringens Eli- zondo et al.

To accomplish this aim 2100 male chicks were fed the following experimental diets C100 corn-based diet S100 sorghum- based diet CS50 diet based on corn and sorghum 11 PC-S corn-based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases and PS-C sorghum-based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn- based diet in subsequent phases.

1993.The different ways of replacing corn with sorghum are able to alter the intestinal microbiota of broilersIn the small intestine of the chickens 653 genera of bacteria were encountered and the 20 most prevalentTable 6 Values of AME AMEn and CMDM of experimental diets for broilers at different agesAME kcalkg DMAMEn kcalkg DMCMDM DietC100 corn-based diets S100 sorghum-based diets CS50 diets based on corn and sorghum 11 PC-S corn-based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases PS-C sorghum- based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn-based diet in subsequent phases.Means within a row lacking a common superscript differ p  0.05.genera corresponded to 86.3 of the total bacteria Table 7.

Both of the experiments consisted of five treatments with five replicates 10 replicates total with six and three birds per cage for each time of collection respectively.Experimental diets performance and intestinal morphologyThe five experimental diets for both the performance and metabolism trials were as follows C100 corn- based diets S100 sorghum-based diets CS 50 diets based on corn and sorghum 11 PC-S corn- based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases and PS-C sorghum-based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn-based diet in subsequent phases.

In this study the abrupt change between corn and sorghum did not influence the jejunal epithelium because these measurements were taken 3 days after the diet change.There were no diet x age interactions for values of AME AMEn and CMDM of broiler diets Table 6.

In poultry nutrition sorghum is an important substitute for corn.There are studies showing that the total or par- tial replacement of corn with sorghum is a viable option from the first day of life Garcia et al.

This is due to the lower xanthophyll level in the sorghum grain only 10 of the xanthophyll incorn which is responsible for the yellow colour of broiler carcasses Blessin 1962.Diets using corn sorghum or combinations of both did not affect villus height width or number of goblet cells crypt depth villuscrypt ratio or the surface area magnification ratio of the jejunum of broilers at 10 days of age Table 5.

On the other hand the abrupt change from corn to sorghum on the 8th day PC-S resulted in decreased levels of the genus Clostridium class Clostridia in the small intestine as mentioned above the contrast analysis also detected the tendency for decreased Clostridium when sorghum was fed after the pre-starter phase.
