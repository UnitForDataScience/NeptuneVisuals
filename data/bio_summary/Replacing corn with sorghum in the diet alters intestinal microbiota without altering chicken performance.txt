in this study the abrupt change between corn and sorghum did not influence the jejunal epithelium because these measurements were taken 3 days after the diet change.there were no diet x age interactions for values of ame amen and cmdm of broiler diets table 6. the different ways of replacing corn with sorghum did not influence diet metabolizability at either age as demonstrated in a previous study shakouri et al.

a total of 300 male ross ap95 broiler chickens were placed in a randomized complete block design in which two experiments were conducted and each experiment was considered a block block a and block b. both of the experiments consisted of five treatments with five replicates 10 replicates total with six and three birds per cage for each time of collection respectively.experimental diets performance and intestinal morphologythe five experimental diets for both the performance and metabolism trials were as follows c100 corn- based diets s100 sorghum-based diets cs 50 diets based on corn and sorghum 11 pc-s corn- based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases and ps-c sorghum-based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn-based diet in subsequent phases.

2013. in poultry nutrition sorghum is an important substitute for corn.there are studies showing that the total or par- tial replacement of corn with sorghum is a viable option from the first day of life garcia et al.

sas 9.4 was used for all of the analyses sas institute cary nc usa.results and discussiondifferent strategies of replacing corn with sorghum did not affect performance and intestinal epithelium of broilers or the metabolizability of dietsin the first 7 days of age chicks were fed corn-baseddiets r  16 sorghum-based diets r  16 or corn and sorghum-based diets r  8. however these diets did not influence feed intake body weight body weight gain or feed conversion rate ratio table 2. the abrupt change between corn- and sorghum-based diets did not affect the performance of the chicks in the first 3 days after this change table 3. in addition diets did not affect broiler performance up to 40 days of age table 4. at the end of the experiment viabil- ity was not affected by the diets tested p  0.121 with an average value of 96.5. these results show that total or partial replacement of corn with sorghum did not affect broiler performance additionally per- formance was not affected by the abrupt change of these grains after the pre-starter phase.

on the other hand the abrupt change from corn to sorghum on the 8th day pc-s resulted in decreased levels of the genus clostridium class clostridia in the small intestine as mentioned above the contrast analysis also detected the tendency for decreased clostridium when sorghum was fed after the pre-starter phase.

doi 10.1111jpn.12614original article replacing corn with sorghum in the diet alters intestinal microbiota without altering chicken performancen.

when chicks were fed a corn-based diet in the pre- starter phase c100 and pc-s they showed higher levels of bacillus compared to those fed a sorghum- based diet in the same phase s100 and ps-c. the increase in age led to an increase in lactobacillus sta- phylococcus weissella brevibacterium streptococcus and turicibacter levels and a decrease in clostridium entero- coccus blautia aerococcus and ruminococcus.

the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and intestinal health of broilers fed diets containing corn andor sorghum during different periods of rearing.

in conclusion feeding sorghum in place of corn as well as the grain change after the pre-starter phase does not alter broiler performance.

however sorghum alters the intestinal microbiota resulting in a lower percentage of clostridium and a higher percentage of lactobacillus in the small intestine and caeca respectively.keywords nutrition milo gut microbiota microflora 16s genecorrespondence n. s. fagundes department of animal science university of sao paulo av.
