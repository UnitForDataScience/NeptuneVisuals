The expression of Claudin15 Clic4 and TGF-b were significantly higher in the colon tissue of ZA and NC mice compared with the colon tissue of CC mice Figure 3B.Consistently CLCN3 expression in liver and colon were enhanced in the ZA group compared with the CC group Figure 3C.Sequencing data for the whole 16S rRNA gene revealed variations in gut microbial composition following L. casei Zhang or vitamin K2 administration suggesting that each intervention modulated the gut microbial community structure in distinctive ways Figure 4A.

casei Zhang-treated mice also exhibited significantly increased osteocalcin levels compared with the CC group p  0.05 but the effect of vitamin K2 was modest Figure 1E p  0.05.In the evaluation of colon histology the CC mice had severe inflammation and hyperplasia  while ZA and VK intervention resulted in reduced granulocytic infiltrate and hyperplasia suggesting an attenuated response to the AOMDSS treatment compared with the CC mice Figure 2A.

casei Zhang with cancer induction group 6 miceZA 4 x 109 cfud Vitamin K2 with cancer induction group 6 miceVK MK-7 addition was 50 mgkg diet and untreated controls 6 mice NC group.Induction of colitis-associated colon cancerChronic colitis-associated colon cancer was induced using the well-established AzoxymethaneDextran sulfate sodium AOMDSS model 39.

Additionally we examined signaling molecules potentially involved in the anti-carcinogenic effect.RESULTSTo investigate whether L. casei Zhang or vitamin K2 protect mice against intestinal carcinogenesis we subjected mice to a chemically-induced intestinal tumor protocol.

Our data showed gut microbiota and its product vitamin K2 determined the susceptibility to colon cancer via a complex mechanism.

We showed that the L. casei Zhang or vitamin K2 Menaquinone-7 intervention significantly alleviated intestinal tumor burden in mice.

The histological score markedly decreased in treated mice Figure 2B p  0.05 suggesting that administration of L. casei Zhang or vitamin K2 significantly reduced the severity of the AOMDSS model.L.

Besides the enriched species we further identified family Prevotellaceae was enriched in ZA group and Lactobacillus as a significantly enriched genera in the VK group Supplementary Figure 1.We next investigated the effect of L. casei Zhang or Vitamin K2 on the production of SCFAs in caecum contents from the mice.

Thus we hypothesized that L. casei Zhang and vitamin K2 might affect colon cancer by modulating the adiponectin.

Expectedly administration of L. casei Zhang or vitamin K2 decreased susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis as fewer tumors and large-sized tumors were found Figure 1B and 1C p  0.05.
