Although some Veillonella OTUs were more abun- dant in the control biofilms the total abundance of the genus significantly increased when erythritol was present 38 abundance for control biofilms 51 abundance for 5 erythritol biofilms and 56 abun- dance for 10 erythritol biofilms .DiscussionIn this study biofilms grown in the presence of erythritol showed a significantly different bacterial species composition and were less diverse compared to the control biofilms.

Total as well as specific protease activity was lower in biofilms grown in the presence of erythritol compared to the control biofilms b and c. Total pro- tease activity fell from 406 RFUmin SD  183 on average for the control biofilms to 314 RFUmin SD  175 in 5 erythritol biofilms and 179 RFU min SD  132 in 10 erythritol biofilms showing a dose-dependent reduction.

In line with this the Shannon diversity index of the biofilms was significantly lower kh2  39.5 p  0.001 if erythritol was present2.5 - 0.3 for the control biofilms versus 2.2 - 0.2 and 1.8 - 0.2 for 5 and 10 erythritol biofilms respectively .

The bacterial density of biofilms grown in the presence of 10 erythritol was on average 80 lower than that of the control biofilms 0.5 log10 difference.Figure 1.

Specific protease activ- ity was reduced from 10.1 RFUmin SD  3.8 in the control biofilms to 2.3 RFUmin SD  1.5 in the 5 erythritol biofilms.

Nonetheless the specific protease activity in the biofilms grown in the pre- sence of 10 erythritol was low compared to the control samples.Microbial compositionTo evaluate the effect of erythritol on the microbial composition of the biofilms the bacterial DNA was analysed using 16S rDNA sequencing.

In biofilms from some volunteers Prevotella OTU23 was exclusively present in 0 erythritol biofilms while in other volunteers this OTU was not present at all.

Biofilms grown in the presence of 10 erythritol contained more Streptococcus OTU2 compared to the other conditions.Different OTUs of Veillonella were identified as biomarkers for both the control biofilms and the 10 erythritol biofilms.

Control biofilms showed higher abundance of OTU128 and 10 erythritol biofilms contained more of OTU1 and OTU71.

Average relative abundance of 20 of the most abundant genera remaining genera are grouped as 'other' in a 0 erythritol biofilms b 5 erythritol biofilms and c 10 erythritol biofilms.was present .
