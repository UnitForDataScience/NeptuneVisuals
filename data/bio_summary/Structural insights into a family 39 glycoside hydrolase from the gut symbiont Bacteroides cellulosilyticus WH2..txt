Overall we propose that these changes in the conformation of the active site of GH39wh2 are responsible for a new substrate specificity in the GH39 family.Bio-informatics analysesTo support functional adaptation among members of the GH39 family we construct a phylogenetic tree using the entire GH39 family sequences.

An example of this sequential synergic action was evidenced by the characterization of eight GHs encoded by a PUL from Bac- teroides ovatus involved in the complete degradation of xyloglucan .ConclusionIn summary the crystal structure of the single GH39 member from Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2 reveals a similar structuralfold and catalytic residues as reported for other members of the GH39 family but surprisingly lacks activity on typical GH39 sub- strates consistent with an enlarged active site groove.

These structural adaptations seem to favour recognition of large branched substrates and may explain the lack of activity of GH39wh2 toward small xylose-based and other typical substrates from GH39 members emphasizing the molecular diversity within the GH39 family.

In contrast to common exoglycosidase activities previously reported for most members of the GH39 family PslG could represent the first member with an endoglycosidase activity  .In this study we report the 2.5 A resolution crystal structure of the single GH39 member GH39wh2 from the human gut bacteria Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2.

Although a monomer state is not a common feature in GH39 family GH39wh2 appears to be the third member to behave as a monomer in solution along with the GH39 from Caulobacter crescentus CcXynB2 and the recently reported PslG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa  .

Differently GH39 from B. intestinalis and B. ovatus share more than 20 of sequence identity with GH39wh2 and belong to its subgroup in the GH39 family.

The phylogram of family GH39 was generated using in- house modified version of Jalview .

The contribution of these domains and their precise role remain unclear and curiously GH39wh2 is the first reported GH39to own three unknown accessory domains.Significant changes in active-site conformationThe comparison with other GH39 structures revealed that GH39wh2 active site is located within the central ba8 TIM barrel at the basis of a large shallow groove formed by the six surface loops 200-219 247-258 282-294 314-337 366-375 and 402-413 respectively named L1 to L6.

The phylogenetic analysis documents the large diversity among GH39 family and clustered PslG and GH39wh2 within a new subgroup with potential new substrate specificity.Finally the gene coding for GH39wh2 is present in an identified PUL that encodes for 6 other glycoside hydrolases belonging to GH78 GH16 GH3 GH2 and GH92 families c  .

The accessory domain changes the accessibility and molecular topography of the catalytic interface in monomeric GH39 b-xylosidases.
