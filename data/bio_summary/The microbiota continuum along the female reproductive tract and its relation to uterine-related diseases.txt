Furthermore it is not known if anupper reproductive tract microbiota could play a role in uterine- related diseases such as hysteromyoma adenomyosis and endometriosis.Here we systematically sampled the microbiota at six sites within the female reproductive tract from a large cohort of Chinese women of reproductive age.

Here we systematically sample the microbiota within the female reproductive tract in 110 women of reproductive age and examine the nature of colonisation by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and cultivation.

Thus live bacteria do exist in the upper reproductive tract of which we succeeded in isolation of some using conventional culturing methods.Signature species for each site of the reproductive tract.

Altogether these results suggest that the composition of the vagino-uterine microbiota potentially could beafused to detect a number of ailments common to reproductive age women.Functional inferences of the reproductive tract microbiota.

We also showed that microbiota at the upper reproductive tract can be available through laparoscopy with minimal artificial effects and contaminations laying the basis for the usage of this sampling route in subsequent studies.We find that both the upper and the lower reproductive tract are home for facultative anaerobes and aerobes in contrast to the situation in bacterial vaginosis and more recently also reported in endometrial cancer Supplementary Table 5 represented by overgrowth with obligate anaerobes being linked to adverseoutcomes such as pre-term birth and sexually transmitted dis- eases  .

The results reflect a microbiota continuum along the female reproductive tract indicative of a non-sterile environment.

The study provides insight into the nature of the vagino-uterine microbiome and suggests that sur- veying the vaginal or cervical microbiota might be useful for detection of common diseases in the upper reproductive tract.1 BGI-Shenzhen Shenzhen 518083 China.

email n marsupials and placental mammals the female reproductive tract has developed unique structures such as the vagina and the uterus.

During the reproductive cycle mature oocytes from the ovaries enter the peritoneal cavity to be captured by fimbriae of the fallopian tubes.
