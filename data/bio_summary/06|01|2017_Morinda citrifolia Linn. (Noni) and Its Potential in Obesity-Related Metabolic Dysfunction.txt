Hydroxycinnamic acids include o-coumaric acid m-coumaric acid caffeic acid ferulic acid and sinapic acid and are present in the form of simple esters with glucose or quinic acid.

Hydroxybenzoic acids include salicylic acid gentisic acid p-hydroxybenzoic acid gallic acid vanillic acid and 34-dimethoxybenzoic acid.

The most used polyphenols include phenolic acids gentisic acid p-hydroxybenzoic acid and the derivative chlorogenic acid and flavonoids epicatechin catechin rutin quercetin and kaempferol.

The bioactive compounds responsible for the effects of fNJ were gentisic acid which was the phenolic in the highest amount followed by p-hydroxybenzoic acid and chlorogenic acid .Many alternatives of anti-hypertensive therapies have been widely studied.

The main vitamins reported in noni fruit puree are ascorbic acid vitamin C which corresponds to 250 mg ascorbic acid per 100 g fresh matter niacin vitamin B3 and vitamin A .Chemical Composition of the Noni PlantDespite the issues surrounding Morinda citrifolia fruit especially its taste and odor people still use the bottle-pasteurized juice either in pure form or mixed with other juices due to the various phytochemicals in the noni plant totaling approximately 200 compounds.

The most common acid derivative is chlorogenic acid .Flavonoids are abundant compounds in nature and they are divided into six subgroups flavonols flavanones isoflavanoids flavones flavand-3-ol and anthocyanins.

Ursolic acid and related triterpene compounds such as oleanolic acid betulinic acid uvaol and a- and b-amyrin are widespread in many plants .

The use of noni for esophageal reflux and gastric ulcerative disease has also produced good results such as preventing the occurrence of esophagitis due to acid reflux reducing the formation of acute gastric lesions induced by ethanol suppressing the development of gastric lesions and also significantly inhibiting gastric acid secretion and pepsin activity in the pylorus-ligated rat .

One explanation for the effectiveness of NJ is the large amount of phenolic acids present in its composition including gentisic acid p-hydroxybenzoic acid and chlorogenic acid Table .A recent study demonstrated positive effects of Morinda citrifolia leaves MLE as dried plant material that were extracted with 60 ethanol MLE 60 in HFD obese Sprague-Dawley male rats.

The polyphenols rutin flavonoid and o-coumaric acid phenol acid showed the best results in the inhibition of differentiation with lower levels.
