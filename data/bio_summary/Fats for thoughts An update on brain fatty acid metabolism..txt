Ketogenic diets or medium-chain fatty acid supplementations were shown toproduce therapeutic effects in several brain pathologies.Moreover the positive effects exerted on brain functions by short-chain FAs and the consideration that they can be produced by intestinal flora metabolism contributed to the better understanding of the link between gut-health and brain-health.Finally attention was paid also to the regulatory role of essential polyunsaturated FAs and their deriva- tives on brain homeostasis.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A recent study on isolated rat brain mitochondria demonstrated that FAs are utilized as energy source in astrocytes and neurons when furnished in association with other respiratory substrates a situation that resembles the in vivo condition  Similarly a study conducted in Drosophila demon- strated that the adult brain is able to catabolize FAs and release KBs while a study in rats showed that octanoate oxidation contributes to total brain oxidative energy production Beyond energy metabolism brain FAs themselves or their metabolites play many essential roles as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective molecules.

Role of medium-chain short-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids on brain health and brain homeostasis.Medium-chain FAs MCFAs panel A are FAs with 6 to12 carbon atoms and are found as triacylglycerols in food-staff such as coconut oil and goat milk.

SCFAs can also be transported through the BBB into the brain and used for energy production by short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehy- drogenase.Polyunsaturated FAs PUFAs panel C are FAs that present two or more double bonds within the hydrocarbon chain.

The optimal ratio is still debated however dietary supplementations of DHA have been proven efficacious to exert neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo both pre-clinically and clinically  Role of monounsaturated fatty acids MUFAs in the brainMonounsaturated FAs MUFAs are FAs having only one double bond.

Glucose is the preferred energy substrate for the brain whereas the role of FAs is more marginal.

In the following paragraphs we sum- marized most of the metabolic pathways of FAs in the brain starting from those used for energetic demand then mentioning their role in several brain functions and in brain health.Mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism in the brainFA transport across the blood-brain barrier BBB is a complex process involving diffusional and protein-mediated transports predominantly by FA transport protein-1 and -4 FATP-1 1357-2725c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
