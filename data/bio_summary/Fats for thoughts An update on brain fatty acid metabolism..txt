depending on the position of the double bonds clos- est to the methyl side pufas are divided in three classes w-3 w-6 and w-9.linoleic acid a c182 w-6 pufa and a-linolenic acid a c183 w-3 pufa can be the precursors for other pufas such as arachidonic acid aa c204 w-6 pufa eicos- apentaenoic acid epa c205 w-3 pufa and docosahexaenoic acid dha c226 w-3 pufa.

moreover it has recently become evident that intestinal microbiota can be part of this signaling greatly influencing many brain functions the main products of intesti- nal bacterial metabolism are short-chain fas scfas b such as butyric acid propionic acid and acetic acid which are able to produce different effects at the central and peripheral nervous sys- tem b. for example a study conducted in mice by frost andromano et al.

ketogenic diets or medium-chain fatty acid supplementations were shown toproduce therapeutic effects in several brain pathologies.moreover the positive effects exerted on brain functions by short-chain fas and the consideration that they can be produced by intestinal flora metabolism contributed to the better understanding of the link between gut-health and brain-health.finally attention was paid also to the regulatory role of essential polyunsaturated fas and their deriva- tives on brain homeostasis.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionthe human brain has a high energy demand that is almost exclusively satisfied metabolizing glucose and under particular cir- cumstances also fatty acids fas and ketone bodies kbs  however the energetic role of fa oxidation in the brain is still matter of debate.

therefore the positive effects of ketogenic diets on brain health should be taken with caution.moreover the knowledge on the role of gut microbiota on thecirculating levels of scfas such as butyric acid propionic acid and acetic acid can explain part of the gut-cns interactions involved in many pathological states.

a recent study on isolated rat brain mitochondria demonstrated that fas are utilized as energy source in astrocytes and neurons when furnished in association with other respiratory substrates a situation that resembles the in vivo condition  similarly a study conducted in drosophila demon- strated that the adult brain is able to catabolize fas and release kbs while a study in rats showed that octanoate oxidation contributes to total brain oxidative energy production beyond energy metabolism brain fas themselves or their metabolites play many essential roles as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective molecules.

in this regard decanoic acid c100 promoted glycol- ysis and lactate formation whereas octanoic acid c80 increased the rates of astrocyte ketogenesis.

arachinodic acid aa is evenly distributed in all types of neural cells while docosahex- aenoic acid dha is mostly concentrated in neuronal including synaptic membranes.

2. role of medium-chain short-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids on brain health and brain homeostasis.medium-chain fas mcfas panel a are fas with 6 to12 carbon atoms and are found as triacylglycerols in food-staff such as coconut oil and goat milk.

scfas can also be transported through the bbb into the brain and used for energy production by short-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehy- drogenase.polyunsaturated fas pufas panel c are fas that present two or more double bonds within the hydrocarbon chain.

the modern western diet is characterized by an aadha ratio of about 151. the optimal ratio is still debated however dietary supplementations of dha have been proven efficacious to exert neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo both pre-clinically and clinically  role of monounsaturated fatty acids mufas in the brainmonounsaturated fas mufas are fas having only one double bond.
