At the same level investments should be made for appropriate education and formation of clini- cians about the interpretation of the clinical significance of the data obtained.In conclusion NGS technology surely represents a giant step forward in the direction toward personalized medicine against CRC but further analyses are necessary to reach more complete results and higher level in our view of the big picture.AbbreviationsNGS next generation sequencing CRC colorectal cancer mCRC metastatic colorectal cancer FAP familial adenomatous polyposis MAP MUTYH-asso- ciated polyposis HNPCC hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer MMR mismatch repair CIN chromosomal instability MSI microsatellite instability CIMP CpG islands methylator phenotype ROS reactive oxygen species NOS nitrative oxygen species VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor FOLFOX folinic acid fluorouracil oxaliplatin FOLFIRI folinic acid fluorouracil irinotecan ZMW zero mode-waveguideEMT epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 3'UTR 3'untranslated region CTC circulating tumor cells.Authors' contributionsFDV wrote the manuscript VM collected NGS CRC results ADM and CC provided technical information about NGS technologies DC FZ CC and EA revised manuscript AT conceived the topic and revised the manuscript.

Ion Torrent technology Ampliseq cancer panel performed better than GS-454 5 amplicons covering KRASEGFR hot spot which failed in identifying KRAS mutations in four samples.Colorectal cancer CRCCRC main featuresColorectal cancer CRC is referred to tumors affecting colon and rectum and represents the third most common type of tumor worldwide .

As for other cancers patients who have been affected by aprevious CRC are at risk for developing a second tumor .Molecular genetics of CRCColorectal cancer is a very heterogeneous type of cancer and accounts for either sporadic or hereditary form.

Further- more it is known that approximately 15 of CRC mostly sporadic show also MSI arising from the MLH1 pro- moter methylation .Connections between CRC and gut microbiotaRecently the existence of an influence exerted by gut microbiota on CRC development has been highlightedsince gut microbiota seems to be directly involved in the regulation of intestinal immune system and promotion of intestinal inflammation.

Transcriptome profiling of the cancer adjacent non-tumor and distant normal tissues from a colorectal cancer patient by deep sequencing.

In this context deep molecular characterization of tumors is a key element for optimal patient's management and uni- fied guidelines to detect and classify variants interpret and report results should be recommended and adopted .Colorectal cancer CRC is one of the most interest- ing fields of NGS application.

The gen- eral acceptance of this theory by the scientific community led to define colorectal cancer carcinogenesis as a process characterized by multiple sequential mutations.Genetic instability was considered a leader event in CRC as well and distinct pathways correlated to the dis- ease have been identified.

Interestingly they identified for the first time in CRC the p.L1196M mutation on ALK whose protein product induces high resistance to the RTK inhibitor Cri- zotinib in lung cancer.

analyzed by GS Junior the alternative splicing pattern ASP of CD44 a gene associated with cancer and metastasis in differ- ent human CRC cell lines.

Furthermore the CD44 isoforms' expression pat- tern remained constant both in CRC cells and primary and metastatic cancer xenografts.
