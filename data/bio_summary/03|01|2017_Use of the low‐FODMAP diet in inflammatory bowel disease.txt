Indeed in patients with IBD in whom the disease is quiescent referring to no or only low-grade inflammation IBS-like symptoms are present in over 30 irrespective of whether the underlying diagnosis is Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.1 In patients with IBD concurrent IBS confers a significantly worse quality of life23 so interven- tion is warranted.

In a large cohort of Caucasian patients having breath hydrogen tests after lactose 50 g lactose malabsorption was found in over 40 of patients with Crohn's disease n  92 or ulcerative colitis n  56 com- pared with half that proportion in healthy controls n  83 and in those with functional gastrointestinal disorders n  201.13 Fructose malabsorption after a dose of 35 g was significantly more common in patients with Crohn's disease 61 compared with the comparator populations 33-44.

He has published an educationalrecipe book on diet.AbstractIrritable bowel syndrome IBS-like symptoms are not uncommon in patients with quies- cent inflammatory bowel disease IBD.

The low-FODMAP diet on the other hand has efficacy similar to that seen in patients with IBS in three unblinded or observational studies of IBD cohorts who had well-controlled inflammatory disease and in one small randomized cross-over study.

FODMAP intake by patients with IBD is not elevated and in one study fructan intakes were lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in controls.

The effects of FODMAPs on the gut microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease mimic that in IBS with a balance between prebiosis from the addition of FODMAPs and loss of prebiosis from their reduction.

The symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease IBD do share simi- larities with those of irritable bowel syndrome IBS or other functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Many studies have looked more closely at this patient group to determine what proportion of patients has in- flammatory activity and what proportion is in actual remission using endoscopic appearance or fecal calprotectin.4-6 The clinical problem however is defining the cut-off between active disease inducing the symptoms and remission with symptoms that are functional because therapeutic approaches are quite different.
