2013. the study described the changes in growth characteristics of commensal e. coli which are similar to data in the current study.growth characteristics of predominant commensal e. coli isolates from the gut microbiota of fmf-positive participants after probiotic therapythe results of the investigations are presented in table 2. there was a statistically significant increase in the dura- tion of the preparatory phase for the predominant e. coli from group 'c' fmf-positive participants after narine consumption in comparison with those of group 'a' be- fore narine administration 1-79 - 0-055 vs 1-29 - 0-11 p  0-05. no statistically confirmed differences were observed between the placebo 'c' and 'a' groups or the pla- cebo 'c' and 'b' groups where 'b' is 1-2 days after discon- tinuation of probiotics or placebo 1-47 - 0-1 vs 1-44 - 0-09 and 1-57 - 0-074 vs 1-47 - 0-1 table 2.it is known that crp is one of the markers used to detect systemic inflammation.

2011 successfully used this model to investigate the influence the physiological state of e. coli cells had on the expression of the soluble protein a recombinant analogue of glycoprotein g of herpes simplex virus of type 2.thus the administration of the commercial narine for- mulation of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus inmia 9602 er-2 strain 317402 to fmf volunteers caused signif- icant extension of the preparatory growth phase in gut commensal e. coli as compared to the e. coli isolated from fmf patients without administration of narine.

2015.therefore the aim of this study was to investigate whether the consumption of the probiotic narine would have an impact on the growth characteristics of commen- sal e. coli isolates from the gut microbiota of fmf- positive study participants using verhulst's function as a tool for quantification.results and discussioncalculation of critical points in verhulst's equationfor the approximation of empirical growth curves the logistic function of verhulst was used in the following form to calculate the growth of gut commensal e. coli gasparyan et al.

the calculation of critical points on a growth curve allows for the identification of different phases of growth in the microbial population that correspond to different physio- logical states in bacterial cells.growth characteristics of predominant e. coli isolates012345-1-2table 1 shows the calculated mean values and standard errors of growth parameters of predominant e. coli iso- lated from the fmf-positive participants.

our previous studies indicated that the e. coli strain isolated from the gut microbiota of breast cancer patients had a signifi- cantly lower specific growth rate and reached significantly lower total biomass under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions as compared to e. coli strains isolated from the gut of a healthy individual mirzoyan et al.

the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of the narine probiotic on growth characteristics in the predominant commensal escherichia coli isolates from the gut microbiota in fmf-positive study participants.

bacterial growth of 192 prevalent commensal e. coli isolates found in the volunteer participants' guts was evaluated using verhulst's logistic function.

this study showed that the duration of the preparatory growth phase for the e. coli isolates collected from fmf-positive volunteers was significantly shorter whereas the duration of the logarithmic growth phase was significantly longer p  0-03 than that of the isolates collected from healthy participants.
