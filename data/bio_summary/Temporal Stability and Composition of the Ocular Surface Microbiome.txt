from rea- gents may be falsely assigned to a core of the ocular surface microbiota.Understanding whether the ocular surface is characterised by a 'core' microbiota may shed light on whether idiopathic ocular surface disorders including dry eye syndrome Thygeson's disease episcleritis chronic follicular conjunctivitis all of which have an inflammatory element could be related to the dysregulation of the ocular microbiome such as may occur during the short and long-term use of antibiotics.

A statistically significant increase in microbial richness and Shannon diversity index was observed over time which was possibly related to the variability inherent in randomly sam- pling only a limited area of a low biomass surface and the sparse transient and regional ocular surface microbi- ome that is exposed to the external environment and constantly interacting with the lid marginskin microbiota.

OPENReceived 31 March 2017Accepted 10 August 2017 Published xx xx xxxxTemporal Stability and Composition of the Ocular Surface MicrobiomeJerome Ozkan123 Shaun Nielsen23 Cristina Diez-Vives23 Minas Coroneo4 Torsten Thomas23  Mark Willcox1To determine if there is a core ocular surface microbiome and whether there are microbial community changes over time the conjunctiva of 45 healthy subjects were sampled at three time points over three months and processed using culture-dependent and -independent methods.

.An average of 16 OTUs were observed on the ocular surface at each sampling time point and there was an average of 33 OTUs per subject across the three time points.

Considering the antimicrobial environment of the ocular surfaceand the difficulties involved in generating sufficient amplicon product from ocular surface swabs of healthy individuals compared to individuals with ocular infections  it is unlikely the ocular surface supports such a diverse microbiota as at other body sites.

The low biomass of microbial material from the ocular surface samples posed a risk that material from the environment and reagents could contaminate the analysis of the microbial composition of the ocular surface.

However such conclusion of a core microbiota is confounded by the fact that the majority of studies have sampled the ocular surface only at a single time point and those studies which have sampled longitudinally investigated only a small subset of healthy subjects ranging from one fiveto 11subjects.

We modelled the alpha diversity on the ocular surface against age and sex and using time points and individuals as random factors.
