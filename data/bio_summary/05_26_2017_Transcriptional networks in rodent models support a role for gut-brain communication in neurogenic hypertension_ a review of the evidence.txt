The authors reported some ontology terms for transcriptomic studies that were in common to genome-wide association studies for HTN.

2 right we show a Venndiagram for cell processes that were identified in the mouse studies showing that there was a single subnetwork in com- mon among each of the studies.

R1-R5 refers to the rat-related studies and M1-M3 refers to mouse-related studies.

This approach yielded a core group of 178 transcripts that are prevalent in studies of HTN including leptin and neuropeptide Y.

We then conducted a meta-analysis for transcriptome data generated in brain tissue from HTN studies.

Eight expression studies were reanalyzed in which transcriptomics was conducted in hypertensive animal models spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR and high blood pressure BPH2J Schlager mice 140 microarrays.

Analyses of meta-genome data also suggested that transcriptome networks related to natriuresis thermoreg- ulation reproduction lactation and pregnancy and vasoconstriction were associ- ated to HTN supporting physiological observations in independent studies by others.

Risk factors for HTN include genetics age exerciseinactivity salt sensitivity and obesity among others factors 49 55 and a number of studies have reported on the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression maintenance and treatment of the disease.

In parallel with these technologies there have been significant advances in bioinformatics which leverages computational approaches that synthesize omics data sets within and among studies investi- gating a disease or condition.

Global gene expression in whole blood from patients with HTN was obtained from six different independent studies along with data on systolicdiastolic blood pressure.
