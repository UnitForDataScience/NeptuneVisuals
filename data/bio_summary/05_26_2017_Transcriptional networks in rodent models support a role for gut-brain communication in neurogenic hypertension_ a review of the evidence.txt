snea was conducted for all of the individual comparisons and all data are provided in supplemental data 1. the number of genes for each of the rat and mouse data sets that were successfully mapped in pathway studio using the official gene name  alias is presented in supplemental table s2.

the analyses presented in the current study focused on charac- terizing transcriptome subnetworks which were not done in the original studies and as such offers valuable new infor- mation.each original data set was reanalyzed using geo2r in ncbi and data were imported into pathway studio for snea.

our analysis of data sets designed to identify mirna candidates showed little to no convergence on specificmirna targets among studies data not presented.

this approach yielded a core group of 178 transcripts that are prevalent in studies of htn including leptin and neuropeptide y. we then conducted a meta-analysis for transcriptome data generated in brain tissue from htn studies.

once these new data were gen- erated we then identified the common cell processes found across studies with the rationale being to identity a unifying or common theme.table 2. description of studies used in this meta-analysistitle of studyauthorspubmed idplatform geogse no.samplecountorganismreference list no.at1 receptor blockade regulates the local angiotensin ii system in cerebral microvessels from spontaneously hypertensive ratsanalysis of genes causing hypertension and stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats gene expression profiles in the brainthe transcriptome of the medullary area postrema the thirsty rat the hungry rat and the hypertensive rattranscriptome analysis of nicotine- exposed cells from the brainstem of neonate spontaneously hypertensive and wistar kyoto ratsgene expression profiling of cultured cells from brainstem of newborn spontaneously hypertensive and wistar kyoto ratsglobal identification of the genes and pathways differentially expressed in hypothalamus in early and established neurogenic hypertensionidentification of genes related to the early stage of angiotensin ii-induced acute renal injury by microarray and integrated gene network analysisgenes influencing circadian differences in blood pressure in hypertensive micezhou et al.16601219 rgu34a affymetrixrat genome u34 arrayyoshida et al.24452243 agilent-028282whole rat genome microarray 4x44k v3 feature number versionhindmarch et al.

in the caseof lep leptin for example a satiety hormone numerous studies have confirmed its sympathoexcitatory effects in car-dioregulatory brain regions in rodent htn 1 33 34 52. in the hypothalamus lep plays a role in appetite regulation and central control of blood pressure 52 and its signaling is dysregulated in obesity-related htn 1 33 reportedly work- ing in synergy with the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r to enhance the sympathoexcitatory networks in the brain 23. thus our meta-analysis supports a common theme of overex- pression of lep in brains of rodent models of htn in line with its expected sympathoexcitatory role in htn.mitochondrial bioenergetics a dominant theme in neurogenic htnwe re-analyzed a data set compiled by marques and morris 2012 35 to identify cell processes that were preferentially associated with htn-related transcripts identified in genome wide expression studies at different states of htn i.e.

the ctd is a robust publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how chem- icals interact with genesproteins and how they are associated to disease 11. thus omics data sets are integrated with pathway data leveraging kegg and reactome pathways to characterize a chemical effect or disease.

thus we integrated data generated from different tissues to capture all of the transcripts including those that may have previously been overlooked in different subgroup analyses.each data set was reanalyzed for fold change and p valueusing geo2r with default parameters.

transcripts related to this process included cholecystokinin cck oxytocin oxt tachykinin tac1 dopamine receptor d2 and d3 drd2 drd3 nitric oxide synthase 1 nos1 and 2 cholecystokinin a receptor cckar gap junction protein alpha 1 gja1 proto- oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase kit and free fatty acid receptor 3 ffar3 a short chain fatty acid scfa receptor among others.considering that processes related to gut represented a major theme in both the rat and mouse data sets our next step was to compare the transcripts associated with gut processes between the rat and mouse data sets.

undoubtedly as additional data are generated and new data sets produced the synthesis of pathways in specific tissues will become more possible for each model.

analyses of meta-genome data also suggested that transcriptome networks related to natriuresis thermoreg- ulation reproduction lactation and pregnancy and vasoconstriction were associ- ated to htn supporting physiological observations in independent studies by others.

in parallel with these technologies there have been significant advances in bioinformatics which leverages computational approaches that synthesize omics data sets within and among studies investi- gating a disease or condition.

one recent study set out to identify signature genes related to blood pressure and htn 26. global gene expression in whole blood from patients with htn was obtained from six different independent studies along with data on systolicdiastolic blood pressure.
