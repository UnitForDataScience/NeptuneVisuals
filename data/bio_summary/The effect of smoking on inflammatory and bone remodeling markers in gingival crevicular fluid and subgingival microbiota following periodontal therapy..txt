This study compares gingival crevicular fluid levels of inflammatory and bone remodeling markers in heavy smokers and non-smokers following active and supportive periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis.Material and Methods Gingival crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque were collected from the deepest periodontal pocket in 50 patients 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers at baseline T0 following active T1 and 12 mo of supportive periodontal therapy T2.

Apparently there seems to be an immunosuppressant effect of smoking regulating the local inflammatory response and bone remodeling markers captured in gingival crevicular fluid following periodontal therapy.Cigarette smoking may affect periodon- tal tissues through modulating the immune response to periodontal patho- gens.

Thus far no prospective study has compared inflammatory responses in gingival crevicular fluid following active periodontal therapy APT and supportive periodontal therapy SPT in smokers and non-smokers.This prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that smoking downregulates the expression of the inflammatory molecules in gin- gival crevicular fluid during treatment of chronic periodontitis.

Further non-pooled samples and an objective validation of smok- ing status reduced the number of confounding factors in the compar- isons of gingival crevicular fluid markers following periodontal ther- apy in smokers and non-smokers and may to some extent weight up for the relatively low sample size.The results herein confirmed the study hypothesis by a suppressed inflammatory reaction presented as reduced expression of gingival crevic- ular fluid markers in heavy smokers particularly for proinflammatory markers and chemokines.

A few prospective studies have inves- tigated the relationship between smoking and levels of proinflamma- tory markers chemokines and bone markers in gingival crevicular fluid following periodontal therapy.

The effect of smoking on inflammatory and bone remodeling markers in gingival crevicular fluid and subgingival microbiota following periodontal therapy.

Further- more smokers did not respond to periodontal therapy with significant changes in the amounts of any marker in gingival crevicular fluid and a nega- tive association was detected between smoking and expression of markers at plaque-positive sites.
