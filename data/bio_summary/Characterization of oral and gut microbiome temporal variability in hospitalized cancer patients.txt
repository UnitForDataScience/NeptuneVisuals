Many of the previous investigations examining temporal variability of the microbiome using healthy partici- pants have been limited by small numbers of volun- teers short periods of longitudinal sampling or by being focused on only one site of collec- tion On the other hand the limited number of temporal variability studies among ill patients have typically been in cohorts with chronic ailments such as atopic dermatitis or colitis -A study of stool sam- ples from 14 patients under intensive care described rapid shifts in microbiome composition to ultra-low di- versity communities comprised of four or less taxa as a result of aggressive antibiotic treatment and other inten- sive care medication stresses such as opioids Simi- lar dramatic changes in the microbiome were also observed in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant where increased microbial chaos early after transplant is thought to be a potential risk factor for sub- sequent graft versus host disease However quantitative measurements of longitudinal microbial variability among ill patients and an analysis of factors affecting microbiome temporal stability are lacking - Moreover despite many reports associat- ing low microbial diversity with different illnesses most studies associate only one-time microbiome mea- surements with subsequent clinical outcomes which could be potentially problematic in settings of significant temporal variability  .Our group previously reported that a single measure-ment of baseline stool microbial diversity was associatedwith infectious risk for 34 patients during induction chemotherapy IC for acute myelogenous leukemia AML Similar to other studies of ill patients we observed instances of rapid and profound shifts in the microbiota in our AML cohort  Thus herein we sought to quantify the overall intra-patient temporal variability of the oral and stool microbiome of this cohort expanded to 59 patients.

Conversely it has been reported that the variability of one body site was not associated with the variability of other body habitats in healthy cohorts .High intra-patient temporal variability of oral and stool microbiome among AML patients is associated with increased pathogenic-associated genera abundanceNext we sought to determine the temporal variability in microbiome community structure and membership asTable 1 Clinical features of 59 AML patientsCharacteristicNumber DemographicsMedian age in years a55 49-68Male31 52.5Female28 47.5Median days on study28 25-35Median number of oral samples8 6-9Median number of stool samples6 4-8 ChemotherapyHypomethylatorsb14 23.7Non-fludarabine high intensityc19 32.2Fludarabine-containingd19 32.2Othere7 11.8Chemotherapeutic responseComplete remission after IC20 33.8Overall response ratef43 72.8InfectionsgMicrobiologically documented infection15 25.4Clinically documented infection14 23.7No infection30 50.8Antimicrobial administrationReceived treatment antibioticsh53 89.8Carbapenem 72 h39 66.1Piperacillintazobactam 72 h14 23.7Cefepime 72 h26 44.1Received prophylactic antibiotics59 100Median number of antibiotics administered6 4-7 Median number of days exposed to all antibioticsi28 24-35 Median number of days exposed to treatment antibiotics 16 9-24 Median number of days exposed to prophylactic antibiotics 16 8-28a All median values in this table have the interquartile range in parenthesesb These chemotherapies included 1 vasoroxin in combination with decitabine 2 decitabine alone 3 azacytidine in combination with pracinostat4 azacytidine in combination with quidartinib and 5 SGI-110c These chemotherapies included 1 CIA 2 CLIA 3 or CIA  sorafanibd These chemotherapies included 1 FLAG-Ida or 2 FIA regimenseOther chemotherapies included1 omacetaxine in combination with low-dose cytarabine or 2 Clad  LDACf Includes CR morphologic complete remission CRi morphologic completeremission with incomplete bloodcount recovery and CRp morphologic complete remission with incomplete platelet recoveryg Specific information on microbiologically and clinically documentedinfections can be found in the Methodsh Refers to any antibioticantimicrobial-based therapy given for suspected or proven infection that is not included as prophylaxis cephalosporins or fluoroquinilones.

Other results for relative abundance differences in spe- cific genera those 1 abundance between patient stability categories can be found in Additional file Figure S3.Intra-patient temporal instability of microbial diversity is linked to adverse infectious outcomes during and after IC To evaluate the clinical consequences of the observed differences in temporal stability in our cohort we sought to determine if intra-patient temporal variability of the microbiome could be linked with adverse outcomes dur- ing and following IC.

Specifically we analyzed if the measures of temporal variability CVs of the SDI and weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances were corre- lated with infection during IC infection in the 90 days post-IC neutrophil recovery or response of the leukemia to chemotherapy.Although temporal variability of neither oral nor stoolcommunity membership unweighted UniFrac CV and structure weighted UniFrac CV was significantly correlated with infection during IC Additional file Figure S4 patients who had higher levels of oral vari- ability based on a-diversity had significantly higher rates of infection during IC P 0.02 Fig.

Total days on antibiotics was significantly associated with increased temporal variability of both oral microbial diversity P 0.03 and community structure P 0.002.Conclusions These data quantify the longitudinal variability of the oral and gut microbiota in AML patients show that increased variability was correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and offer the possibility of using stabilizing taxa as a method of focused microbiome repletion.

These data indicate temporal vari- ability and microbiome composition dynamics are likely important markers for infectious risk during and after IC.Duration of antibiotic treatment is associated with temporal instability of the oral microbiome during IC in AML patientsDue to the fact that temporal instability of the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome is associated with infectiousABP 0 .021.51.5P 0 .251.01.00.50.50.0C1.5No infectionInfectionP  0.22 0.0D1.5No infectionInfection P  0.04 1.01.00.50.50.0No infection Post IC Infection Post IC0.0No infection Post IC Infection Post ICEStaphylococcusStenotrophomonasNoYesNoYesNoYesInfectionFig.

Thus our data suggest a site-specific effect of antimicrobials on temporal variability in the AML cohort.Prolonged antibiotic exposure is associated with long-term infectious outcomes among AML patients undergoing ICTo this point we had found that total antibiotic exposure was significantly associated with microbiome temporal instability in AML patients undergoing IC and that microbiome instability could be associated with adverse infectious outcomes.

In addition we sought to determine the consequences of microbiome temporal instability on patient outcomes and clinical fac- tors driving intra-patient temporal variability of the microbiome during IC.
