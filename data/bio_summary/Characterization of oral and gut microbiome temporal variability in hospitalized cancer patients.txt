many of the previous investigations examining temporal variability of the microbiome using healthy partici- pants have been limited by small numbers of volun- teers short periods of longitudinal sampling or by being focused on only one site of collec- tion on the other hand the limited number of temporal variability studies among ill patients have typically been in cohorts with chronic ailments such as atopic dermatitis or colitis -a study of stool sam- ples from 14 patients under intensive care described rapid shifts in microbiome composition to ultra-low di- versity communities comprised of four or less taxa as a result of aggressive antibiotic treatment and other inten- sive care medication stresses such as opioids simi- lar dramatic changes in the microbiome were also observed in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant where increased microbial chaos early after transplant is thought to be a potential risk factor for sub- sequent graft versus host disease however quantitative measurements of longitudinal microbial variability among ill patients and an analysis of factors affecting microbiome temporal stability are lacking - moreover despite many reports associat- ing low microbial diversity with different illnesses most studies associate only one-time microbiome mea- surements with subsequent clinical outcomes which could be potentially problematic in settings of significant temporal variability  .our group previously reported that a single measure-ment of baseline stool microbial diversity was associatedwith infectious risk for 34 patients during induction chemotherapy ic for acute myelogenous leukemia aml similar to other studies of ill patients we observed instances of rapid and profound shifts in the microbiota in our aml cohort  thus herein we sought to quantify the overall intra-patient temporal variability of the oral and stool microbiome of this cohort expanded to 59 patients.

increased intra-patient temporal variability of the oral sdi was correlated with increased risk of infection during ic p 0.02 and higher stool sdi cvs were correlated with increased risk of infection 90 days post-ic p 0.04. total days on antibiotics was significantly associated with increased temporal variability of both oral microbial diversity p 0.03 and community structure p 0.002.conclusions these data quantify the longitudinal variability of the oral and gut microbiota in aml patients show that increased variability was correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and offer the possibility of using stabilizing taxa as a method of focused microbiome repletion.

conversely it has been reported that the variability of one body site was not associated with the variability of other body habitats in healthy cohorts .high intra-patient temporal variability of oral and stool microbiome among aml patients is associated with increased pathogenic-associated genera abundancenext we sought to determine the temporal variability in microbiome community structure and membership astable 1 clinical features of 59 aml patientscharacteristicnumber demographicsmedian age in years a55 49-68male31 52.5female28 47.5median days on study28 25-35median number of oral samples8 6-9median number of stool samples6 4-8 chemotherapyhypomethylatorsb14 23.7non-fludarabine high intensityc19 32.2fludarabine-containingd19 32.2othere7 11.8chemotherapeutic responsecomplete remission after ic20 33.8overall response ratef43 72.8infectionsgmicrobiologically documented infection15 25.4clinically documented infection14 23.7no infection30 50.8antimicrobial administrationreceived treatment antibioticsh53 89.8carbapenem 72 h39 66.1piperacillintazobactam 72 h14 23.7cefepime 72 h26 44.1received prophylactic antibiotics59 100median number of antibiotics administered6 4-7 median number of days exposed to all antibioticsi28 24-35 median number of days exposed to treatment antibiotics 16 9-24 median number of days exposed to prophylactic antibiotics 16 8-28a all median values in this table have the interquartile range in parenthesesb these chemotherapies included 1 vasoroxin in combination with decitabine 2 decitabine alone 3 azacytidine in combination with pracinostat4 azacytidine in combination with quidartinib and 5 sgi-110c these chemotherapies included 1 cia 2 clia 3 or cia  sorafanibd these chemotherapies included 1 flag-ida or 2 fia regimenseother chemotherapies included1 omacetaxine in combination with low-dose cytarabine or 2 clad  ldacf includes cr morphologic complete remission cri morphologic completeremission with incomplete bloodcount recovery and crp morphologic complete remission with incomplete platelet recoveryg specific information on microbiologically and clinically documentedinfections can be found in the methodsh refers to any antibioticantimicrobial-based therapy given for suspected or proven infection that is not included as prophylaxis cephalosporins or fluoroquinilones.

also of note the abundance of non- pathogenic organisms in the stool such as akkermansia were associated with increased temporal stability of both the microbiome community structure and diversity both stool weighted unifrac cv and sdi cv p  0.001 r  -0.2. thus our data imply that patients with a rela- tively high relative abundance of commensal organisms like akkermansia maintain a more stable microbiome over the course of their hospitalization whereas higherrelative abundances of pathogenic-associated bacteria like staphylococcus and streptococcus are associated with temporal instability of both the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome.stabilizing and destabilizing taxa can be inferred by categorizing aml patients into stable average or variable microbiomes during icwe next sought to determine if we could infer stabiliz- ing or destabilizing taxa by looking at significant differ- ences in the relative abundance of taxa between patients with stable average or variable microbiomes based on their intra-patient microbial temporal stability.

complete remission cr of aml was assessed using standard definitions .resultsaml patients undergoing ic exhibit temporal instability of the stool and oral microbiome diversityin order to understand the intra-patient temporal vari- ability of the microbiome among hospitalized patients with aml we performed sequencing of the v4 regionof the 16s rrna gene via the miseq platform illumina using the 2 x 250-bp protocol on a total of 901 lon- gitudinal samples collected twice weekly from initiation of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery for 59 aml patients undergoing ic.

moreover aml patients are at high risk for infection during ic and such infections are generally derived from the commensal microflora we hypothesized that higher microbiome intra-patient temporal variability driven by prolonged antibiotic exposure would be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.methodspatient recruitment and specimen collectionstudy subjects included 59 newly diagnosed adult aml patients undergoing ic at md anderson cancer center mdacc in houston tx from september 2013 to october 2014. aml patients initiating inpatient ic at mdacc were approached for study inclusion unless they had systemic infection.

reports in healthy persons have observed associations between diversity and tem- poral stability such as individuals with a more diverse microbiome are likely to have a more stable microbiome over time however we did not find any statis- tically significant correlations between either the baseline or median sdi values of patients and their temporal vari-ability as measured by the cv of the weighted unifrac distances of their samples suggesting microbiome struc- tural variability does not appear to be affected by a- diversity in treated aml patients additional file figure s2.it is well known that patients in the hospital are at risk for colonization and intestinal domination by pathogenic bacteria and that a diverse microbiome provides colonization resistance against many such organisms  .

thus our data suggest a site-specific effect of antimicrobials on temporal variability in the aml cohort.prolonged antibiotic exposure is associated with long-term infectious outcomes among aml patients undergoing icto this point we had found that total antibiotic exposure was significantly associated with microbiome temporal instability in aml patients undergoing ic and that microbiome instability could be associated with adverse infectious outcomes.

herein we sought to determine intra-patient temporal microbiota variability the factors driving such variability and its clinical impact in an extensive longitudinal cohort of hospitalized cancer patients during chemotherapy.methods the stool n  365 and oral n  483 samples of 59 patients with acute myeloid leukemia aml undergoing induction chemotherapy ic were sampled from initiation of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery.

specifically we analyzed if the measures of temporal variability cvs of the sdi and weighted and unweighted unifrac distances were corre- lated with infection during ic infection in the 90 days post-ic neutrophil recovery or response of the leukemia to chemotherapy.although temporal variability of neither oral nor stoolcommunity membership unweighted unifrac cv and structure weighted unifrac cv was significantly correlated with infection during ic additional file figure s4 patients who had higher levels of oral vari- ability based on a-diversity had significantly higher rates of infection during ic p 0.02 fig.

herein we contribute to addressing this knowledge gap by analyzing the inter- patient variability of both the oral and stool micro- biome for 59 aml patients using 800 samples collected over a median of 28 days the factors driving differential variability in this cohort and the association of inter- patient variability with clinical outcomes.when considering how our cohort of leukemia patients compares to healthy individuals we obtained trimmed and processed data from the human microbiome project hmp  to match the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene amplified by this study's primers and processing protocols.

in contrast acute perturbations of an individual's microbiome stability within a temporal context can lead to an unhealthy status considering that one of the principal aims of the microbiome research community is to use the microbiome as either an indicator for morbid- ity or to improve human health an enhanced under- standing of the kinetics and taxonomic characterization of microbiome stability in acutely ill patients is of para- mount importance -although several studies have been done in healthy subjects relatively scant data are available as to the stabil- ity resilience and temporal dynamics of the gastrointes- tinal microbiome in acutely ill patients  -.

groups of patients were analyzed to determine if patients with adverse outcomes had significantly different levels of microbiome temporal variability.

the intra-patient temporal vari- ability of other a-diversity metrics specifically the chao-1 diversity index and simpson's diversity index were also analyzed for the oral mean chao cv 0.39 - 0.18 mean simpson cv 0.33 - 0.24 and stool samples mean chao cv 0.48 - 0.22 mean simpson cv 0.37 - 0.27 of the aml cohort additional file figure s1a b. assessment of the temporal variability of a-diversity also revealed that the sdi cv of oral and stool samples from the same patients were statistically moderately correlated p 0.01 r  0.33 fig.

other results for relative abundance differences in spe- cific genera those 1 abundance between patient stability categories can be found in additional file figure s3.intra-patient temporal instability of microbial diversity is linked to adverse infectious outcomes during and after ic to evaluate the clinical consequences of the observed differences in temporal stability in our cohort we sought to determine if intra-patient temporal variability of the microbiome could be linked with adverse outcomes dur- ing and following ic.
