The efficiency of those requirements may vary for example between individuals or laboratories issues which should certainly be solved as soon as possible.Metabolism of Human Milk OligosaccharidesThe high structural diversity of HMOs complicates acquiring a sophisticated knowledge on what structures are important for infants' health despite the re- cent methodological developments to characterize minute amounts of HMOs and their degradation products in biological samples.Metabolic studies can help to identify if HMOs are absorbed and utilized by the infant's organism.

The remainders are excreted intact or in metabolized form in feces or urine indi- cating that there is no uniform metabolic process for all HMOs 5 24 25.Figure 2 shows a summary of the intake metabolism and examples for po- tential functions of HMOs currently being discussed.Content of Human Milk Oligosaccharides in Term and Preterm MilkTo further improve infant formulas in order to gain more benefit from HMOs a question often raised is how much of an individual component should be sup- plemented.

Meanwhile about 150-200 single HMOs have been characterized.In recent years there has been a tremendous increase in our knowledge re- garding specific effects of HMOs 3-10.

In order to determine which compounds would be most suitable for supple- mentation in which concentrations or combinations and how long they should be given studies are needed regarding the metabolic fate of HMOs as well as their local and systemic effects.A straight forward strategy to investigate the metabolism of HMOs is to de- termine the presence or absence of natural milk oligosaccharides in feces blood urine or tissue.

However since the variation in both HMOs and microbiota composition is vast unequivocal structure-function studies are inevitable for a better understanding of their as- sociation with health and disease.First studies on fecal oligosaccharides and possible metabolites of HMOs in infants have already been reported by Lundblad's group in the 1970s 21.

Re- cent studies using new technologies either included only one or a low number of infants or showed data from premature infants whose intestinal function may be very different from healthy term infants 22 23.Current data have so far led to the conclusion that the major portion of HMOs reaches the lower gastrointestinal tract where HMOs might be used as nutritive factors by various microorganisms or influence their activities.

Sometimes the feces of infants displayed a profile distinguishable from milk where certain HMOspredominated and common especially larger HMOs were clearly diminished and often no HMOs were detected especially after 6-7 months of breast- feeding.Some infants had reduced abundances of larger structures and a remarkably high proportion of difucosylated LNnT isomers at mz 1022 which in con- trast could not be detected in other infants.

Determining the amount of indi- vidual HMOs in urine about 50-160 mg LNT or LNFP II for example can be found a clear indication that HMOs were absorbed 30.

Therefore it can be expected that not only local effects of HMOs within the gastrointestinal tract but also systemic functions may occur.Data presented so far raise the question what it means using human milk as the gold standard when it comes to a standard for the composition of HMOs.

Is the quality of human milk minor when specific HMOs are missing as it is the case in nonsecretors which comprise about 20 of the population Do nonsecretor infants deserve special attention assuming that they may have a higher risk for developing cer- tain diseases Therefore it may not only be necessary to identify HMOs with the highest benefit for most infants but also to determine the healthdisease risk of infants based on their immaturity at birth as well as their own genetic back- ground to improve the benefit of HMO supplementation.Disclosure StatementThere are no conflicts of interest.ReferencesKuhn R Les oligosaccharides du lait.
