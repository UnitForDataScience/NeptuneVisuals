SCFAs were found to be the key mediators of the interaction of gut microbiota with the host serotonergic system.75 Sampson et al reported that microbial metabolites SCFAs promoted neuro-inflammation and motor symptoms in germ-free mice and directly impacted neuro-inflammation and a-synuclein aggregation via postnatal gut-brain signaling from gut microbiota.75 Bile acidsBile acids are synthesized molecules derived from cholesterol in liver and can be profiled by using LC-MS and DESI-IMS techniques.28 TABLE 3 Examples of SMMs associated with gut microbiota and host co-metabolismacid PUFAsArachidonic acid Docosahexaenoic acidBrainBiosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acidsGC-MS GC DESI-IMS MALDI-IMSAD Depression Cognitive anxiety and social behavior Brain dopamine levelsde Theije et al Robertson et al Kishino et al65 et al67 68 SCFAsAcetatePropionate ButyrateBrainfeces colon blood liverFermentation of dietary fibersGC-MSAutism spectrum disorders Neuroprotective effects Central appetite regulation Promotion of colonic serotonin productionSampson et al47 et al69 et al73 Macfabe70 Bile acidsLithocholic acidTauroursodeoxycholic acidUrsodeoxycholic acidKidney liver heart blood fecesSecondary bile acid biosynthesisLC-MS DESI- IMSAD PD HD Prion diseaseSwann et al78 et al19 Castro-Caldas et al Keene et al21 et al28 CatecholaminesDopamine norepinephrineLumen brainTyrosine metabolismGC-MS LC-MS and MALDI-IMSPD AD Brain development motor control and anxiety-like behaviorDiaz Heijtz et al9 et al84 57 Steroid hormonesCortisol AndrogensCellSteroid hormone biosynthesisLC-MSAD-like neuropathology Stress and PDRosario et al86 et al85 17 Amino acid neurotransmittersthe catalysis of bacterial enzymes in intestine76 are modified by deconjugation dehydrogenation dehydroxylation and sulfation reactions to form the secondary bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid or tauroursodeoxycholic acid.77 reported that the absence of special intestinal bacteria in germ-free mice induced a significant effect on the relative composition and abundance of bile acids.

The SMMs derived from microbiota were identified by MS-based metabolomics inour previously pregnancy metabolomics study34 the observed metabolome alterations in neurodegenerative disease had already existed prior to the disease onset the metabolome could be involved in the neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.35 growing number of studies were reported to use metabolomics as a robust method for exploring metabolic markers for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease progression.36 separation technique mass spectrometers sample information and extraction methods were summarized in the Table  Cerebrospinal fluid metabolomeCSF has more physical connection with brain than any other fluid and thus is a potentially reliable source of diagnostic biomarker.37 metabolome was profiled for discovering the biomarkers of neurode- generative diseases to improve therapeutics research and to understand disease pathogenesis.

The disorders of acetylcholine-producing system in brain were associated with Alzheimer's disease with cognitive decline and memory deficit.94 part of the acetylcholine-producing system influencing behavior.8 IMS was applied for the visualization of acetylcholine distribution in CNS.95-97 crosstalk between gut microbiota and the host brain.Additionally recent studies have showed that indigenous spore-forming microbes from gut microbiota could produce multiplenon-neuroactive SMMs such as a-tocopherol tyramine and p- aminobenzoate which indirectly promoted host serotonin biosynthe- sis in gut and influenced gastrointestinal motility and hemostasis 98 CONCLUSIONSAn increasing number of studies have reported the crosstalk between gut microbiota and the host brain on a global basis.

A LC-MS based metabolomics study showed that the alteration of cortisol contributed to the development of PD.17 bacterium called Clostridium scindens from human intestine could affect the structure and levels of cortisol converting cortisol into androgens.85 accumulation of b-amyloid and accelerate the development of AD-like neuropathology in the transgenic mouse model of AD.86 Amino acid neurotransmittersAmino acid neurotransmitters AAN including GABA glycine aspartic acid and glutamic acid play a notable role in signal exchange between neurons.87-89 and brain were determined by using MS techniques.90 found that the bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium from the human intestine were able to produce GABA.91 amino acid receptors and transporters in gastrointestinal tract were activated by the diet AAN and bacteria derived AAN which contributed to release a variety of gut hormones and to affect the ENS and CNS.9293 AcetylcholineAcetylcholine has many functions in both mammalian ENS and CNS as a neuromodulator.

Multiple MS-based analytical techniques provide powerful tools for the identification and quantifi- cation of metabolic interactions between gut microbiota and the host brain.11 metabolism of gut microbiota and the host were summarized Table  Serotonin and tryptophan catabolitesGut microbiota is involved in the regulation of multiple host metabolic pathways giving rise to interactive host-microbiota metabolic axes that physiologically connect the gut and brain.52-55 neurotransmitter contributing to happiness and well-being has aFIGURE 3 A schematic of the metabolic crosstalk between gut microbiota and host brain.

Advances in techniques have stimulated a great interest in the application of metabolomics to explore neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease AD Alzheimer's disease PD Huntington's disease HD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS.1 biological samples such as cerebrospinal fluid CSF plasma serum urine and stool collected from PD or AD patients and animals by using multiple mass spectrometry MS-based platforms.2-4 SMMs has not only contributed for better understanding the mechanisms of the development of diseases but also helped discovering new biomarkers for diseases diagnosis.Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized as the progressive degeneration andor death of neuron cells in the brain leading to incurable and debilitating neurological dysfunction.

Furthermore we reviewed recent findingsfrom MS-based metabolomics studies including SMMs and related metabolic pathways existing between gut microbiota and brain and the roles of SMMs in neurodegenerative disease.
