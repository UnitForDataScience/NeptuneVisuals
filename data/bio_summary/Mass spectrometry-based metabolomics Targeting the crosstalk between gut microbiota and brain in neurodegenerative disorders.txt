a hypothetical schematic of the metabolic crosstalk between gut microbiota and the host brain is shown in figure 3. multiple ms-based analytical techniques provide powerful tools for the identification and quantifi- cation of metabolic interactions between gut microbiota and the host brain.11 metabolism of gut microbiota and the host were summarized table  serotonin and tryptophan catabolitesgut microbiota is involved in the regulation of multiple host metabolic pathways giving rise to interactive host-microbiota metabolic axes that physiologically connect the gut and brain.52-55 neurotransmitter contributing to happiness and well-being has afigure 3 a schematic of the metabolic crosstalk between gut microbiota and host brain.
