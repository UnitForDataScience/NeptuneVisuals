a database of known phage genomes was built by merging the mvcs with a set of reference viral genomes obtained from three sources 1 the ncbi refseq database 1609 sequences 2 the complete marine phage genomes obtained from fosmid libraries 208and 3 prophages identified in bacterial genomes with virsorter 12498. the database was made non-redundant byclustering the genomes with blastn with a 95 identity and a 40 coverage cutoff resulting in a non-redundant data set of 32833 sequences.

the rank abundance curve 3a revealed that although reference genomes ranked first mvcs are among the most abundant members of marine viromes that is the top 500. an analysis of the distribution patterns of mvcs across marine virome samples according to their predicted hosts revealed that the most prevalent detected in 450 of the samples and abundant median relative abundance 40.01 mvcs were those predicted to infect cyanobacteria and proteobacteria and supplementary data 6. this trend was also observed for the reference viral genomes as the most abundant and prevalent onesinfected pelagibacter alphaproteobacteria or prochlorococcusand synechococcus cyanobacteria 3c.functional content of viruses varies according to the host.

reads from the 78 selected viromes plus 43 tara oceans viromeswere aligned to a database containing the mvcs and the reference viral genomes that is bacterial and archaeal viruses from the national center forbiotechnology information ncbi refseq database complete marine phage genomes obtained from fosmid libraries and prophages identified in bacterial genomes with virsorter for a total of 32833 sequences.

the virushost ratio vhr defined as the viral genome abundance divided by the host genome abundance was negatively correlated with the host abundance at the levels of genus and supplementary table 3 reference viruses only or phylum and supplementary table 4 reference viruses and mvcs with host prediction.discussionthe mvcs included novel viral genomes and genome fragments.

the discovery that the decrease in the virus-to-microbe ratio at a high host abundance that is not associated with host resistance to infections has expanded this model the recently proposed piggyback-the- winner theory of virus-host interactions postulates that at a high host abundance viruses favour lysogenic infections and integrate into the host genome when those are thriving instead of killing them through a lytic cycle.

4 and yielded nearly 50 of all of our host predictions 1. furthermore this approach was not dependent on the detection of exchanges of genetic material between viruses and their hosts as required by homology matches and crispr.an analysis of paired viral and microbial tara oceans metagenomes indicated a reduction in the vhr towards higher host abundances 6. assuming an increase in sequence abundance proportional to the cell and viral particles abundance in the environment we predict a decrease in thespecific hostvirus pairs ratio with an increased host abundance.abacholeplasma atopobium bacillus bifidobacterium brachyspira burkholderiacandidatus pelagibacter candidatus puniceispirillum cellulophagaclostridium coprococcus corynebacterium croceibacter desulfovibrio exiguobacterium flavobacterium fusobacterium haloferax haloquadratum lactobacillus leptospira leptotrichia leuconostoc magnetospirillum marinomonas methanobacterium mycoplasma myxococcus neisseria olsenella porphyromonas prevotella prochlorococcus rhodobacter rhodopirellula ruegeria selenomonas shewanella spirochaeta spiroplasma staphylococcus streptococcus sulfolobus synechococcus thermus treponemavibrioxylella0-1actinobacteria bacteroidetes chlamydiae chloroflexi crenarchaeota cyanobacteria deinococcus-thermus euryarchaeota firmicutes fusobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes proteobacteria spirochaetes synergistetes tenericutes-3-4-2-10log10microbial abundance1-101log10microbial abundancefigure 6  associations between the microbial host abundance and the virus-host ratio.

the abundances of each pairwise combination of mvcs and reference viral genomes across samples were correlated with sparcc to infer a co-occurrence network 2. all possible pairwise correlations between the viral genome abundances were assigneda value between 1 and 1. we compared the distribution of the correlation values between the reference viral genomes according to the genus of the host they infect.

such a strategy improvesread mapping and often reveals new complete viral genomes or genome fragments.we sought to expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of marine viruses by discovering new genomes through a high-throughput culture-independent methodology.

recent findings showed that prophages are widespread in prokaryote genomes including those taxa that are dominant across marine habitats for example cyanobacteria proteobacteria firmicutesbacteroidetes and actinobacteria and that fast-growing bacteria are more likely to harbour prophages integrated intotheir genomes.

b microbial abundances are summed at the taxonomic level of phylum and vhr was calculated using the abundances of both reference viral genomes and the mvcs for which a putative host was identified.this pattern corroborates the decrease in vhr with an increase in microbial abundance described by the piggyback-the-winner model and hypothesizes lysogeny as a more successful strategy for viral replication at a high host density.

at high host densities rather than killing their hosts viruses might opt to replicate integrated into their host genomes.

5 abundance correlations we developed a new strategy for host prediction based on abundance correlations between the mvcs and the reference phage genomes across the marine viromes.

in this study we closed that gap by discovering new marine viruses without the use of culture- and isolation-based approaches to directly obtain complete viral genomes from marine viromes.

in conclusion we have described and analysed over 27000 mvcs a unique data set of complete and partial marine viral genomes derived from highly abundant members of global marine viromes.
