The virushost ratio VHR defined as the viral genome abundance divided by the host genome abundance was negatively correlated with the host abundance at the levels of genus and Supplementary Table 3 reference viruses only or phylum and Supplementary Table 4 reference viruses and MVCs with host prediction.DiscussionThe MVCs included novel viral genomes and genome fragments.

The discovery that the decrease in the virus-to-microbe ratio at a high host abundance that is not associated with host resistance to infections has expanded this model the recently proposed Piggyback-the- Winner theory of virus-host interactions postulates that at a high host abundance viruses favour lysogenic infections and integrate into the host genome when those are thriving instead of killing them through a lytic cycle.

A database of known phage genomes was built by merging the MVCs with a set of reference viral genomes obtained from three sources 1 the NCBI RefSeq database 1609 sequences 2 the complete marine phage genomes obtained from fosmid libraries 208and 3 prophages identified in bacterial genomes with VirSorter 12498.

Reads from the 78 selected viromes plus 43 Tara oceans viromeswere aligned to a database containing the MVCs and the reference viral genomes that is bacterial and archaeal viruses from the National Center forBiotechnology Information NCBI RefSeq database complete marine phage genomes obtained from fosmid libraries and prophages identified in bacterial genomes with VirSorter for a total of 32833 sequences.

The remaining contigs were likely fragments of larger genomes or complete linear genomes.

Moreover transcriptional regulators and ABC ATP-binding cassette transporters are included among the genes most often identified in the genomes of the viruses thata0.00250.00200.00150.00100.00050.0000MVCReference0100200300Rank400500bcnobacteria teroidetes1e-021e-041e-06dobacteria nobacteria haea teroidetes amydiae oroflexi anobacteria micutes ospirae nctomyceteseobacteria ericutes nown ucomicrobia1e-021e-041e-06amydiae oroflexi narchaeota anobacterianococcus-Thermus yarchaeotamicutes obacteria ospinae nctomycetes ibacteria eobacteria ochaetes ergistetes ericutes nown ucomicrobia0.000.250.50Prevalence in samples0.750.000.250.50Prevalence in samples0.75Figure 3  The abundance patterns of the MVCs and the reference viral genomes across 121 marine viromes.

The distances between the viral genomes or MVCs were measured asDAB 1 2 ABAA BB where AB is the summed bitscore of all hits of genome A against genome B. AA and BB represent the summed bitscore of all hits of genomes A and B against themselves.

b Microbial abundances are summed at the taxonomic level of phylum and VHR was calculated using the abundances of both reference viral genomes and the MVCs for which a putative host was identified.This pattern corroborates the decrease in VHR with an increase in microbial abundance described by the Piggyback-the-Winner model and hypothesizes lysogeny as a more successful strategy for viral replication at a high host density.

At high host densities rather than killing their hosts viruses might opt to replicate integrated into their host genomes.

The large diamonds represent the reference viral genomes colour coded according to the host phylum and the small grey diamonds represent the MVCs.
