supplementation with 1.0 gln to the swine diet during late gestation ameliorates fetal growth retardation in gilts and reduces preweaning mortality of piglets 3. also 1.0 gln supplementation to the diets of postweaned rabbit decreased fattening mortality and modified intestinal microbiota gln plays an important role in nitrogen balance and protein synthesis in resident bacteria of the small intestine 19. these results provide a strategy for gln supplementation to enhance the productivity and performance of pregnant animals and more importantly regulation of intestinal microbiota function.the microbiota residing in the intestinal tract produces a great variety of compounds from the metabolism of dietary and endogenous substrates that could affect host physiology 9. the anatomy genetics and physiology of pigs are very similar to those of humans.

16s rrna sequences obtained from fecal samples from 9 constipated sows 3 in the constipation group and 6 in the 1.0 gln group werebacteroidetes  and actinobacteria  was comparatively increased in the 1.0 gln group while the abundanceof pernicious bacteria oscillospira   0.001treponema   0.011 was decreased.

the aims of this study were a to identify the microflora species in the gut of sows during late pregnancy b to determine the effect of gln regulation on intestinal microflora and c to evaluate the ability of gln supplementation to ameliorate constipation.materials and methodsanimal experiments.

based on 97 similarity an average of 735 and 706 otus operational taxonomic units for bacterial diversity was obtained in constipation group and 1.0 gln group respectively.a venn diagram of the otus is presented in figure because the main nutrient composition of diet was similar there were about 724 similar otus between the constipation and 1.0 gln groups.

the findings of this study lay a technical foundation to further investigate factors associated with constipation during late pregnancy in sows while providing a reference for human therapies.diet is recognized as one of the most influential factors of constipation 5. functional amino acids including gln are important regulators of key metabolic pathways that are crucial for maintenance growth reproduction immune function and intestinal health 21. as the most abundant and the most accreted amino acid in the second third of gestation gln may reduce variation in birth weights 36and improve placental development and fetal growthunder various physiological and pathophysiological situations in both humans and other mammals  .
