It can be seen that the quantity0.1 Gln had higher abundance of Bacteroidetes  and lower abundance of than constipation group.Based on average abundance analysis at the order level Clostridiales 64.44 for constipation group and 59.10 for 0.1 Gln group Bacteroidales 9.79 for constipation group and 29.29 for 0.1 Gln group and Spirochaetales 11.18 for constipation group and 1.67 for 0.1 Gln group were the three major orders of bacteria in the two groups Figure In addition Enterobacteriales Spirochaetales Pseudomonadales RF39 Methanobacteriales Actinomyc- etales Coriobacteriales Alteromonadales and others were found with low abundance in the two groups Figure Group of 0.1 Gln had higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and lower abundance of Spirochaetes  than constipation group.Based on average abundance analysis at the genus levelPrevotella 1.11 and 6.12 Oscillospira 14.32 and 3.90Treponema 11.18 and 1.67 and Ruminococcus 8.60 and 5.82 were the four major genera of bacteria in constipation group and 0.1 Gln group respectively Figure In addition Escherichia Pseudomonas Prevotella Methanobre- vibacter YRC22 Dorea and other bacteria were found in two0.1 Gln had higher abundance of Dorea 600004000020000YX0485524846048362481793914421982196501425006850008499193871323260236566645662156584 56373 47773303533864764747617475944756037710169085183992639797397403973026527118806664930449203491154907636192134741077515635153551485514773686516219621386713863738562 38557 263481018957053646535565349453475435132300714221C.1C.2C.3G.1G.2G.3G.4G.5 G.6Sample nameKingdom Phylum Class OrderFamily Genus SpeciesFigure 1 a A Venn diagram of OTUs.

16S rRNA sequences obtained from fecal samples from 9 constipated sows 3 in the constipation group and 6 in the 1.0 Gln group wereBacteroidetes  and Actinobacteria  was comparatively increased in the 1.0 Gln group while the abundanceof pernicious bacteria Oscillospira   0.001Treponema   0.011 was decreased.

The aims of this study were a to identify the microflora species in the gut of sows during late pregnancy b to determine the effect of Gln regulation on intestinal microflora and c to evaluate the ability of Gln supplementation to ameliorate constipation.Materials and MethodsAnimal Experiments.

Based on 97 similarity an average of 735 and 706 OTUs operational taxonomic units for bacterial diversity was obtained in constipation group and 1.0 Gln group respectively.A Venn diagram of the OTUs is presented in Figure Because the main nutrient composition of diet was similar there were about 724 similar OTUs between the constipation and 1.0 Gln groups.
