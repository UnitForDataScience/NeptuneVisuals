As all samples were treated with RNAse during the DNA extractions the higher A260A280 ratio of scrape samples probably reflects the limitations of the Nanodrop performance with very low concentration samples median 2.2-5.8 ngml DNA or vulnerability to extraction artifactserrors for the same reason.

Hence although self-sampling brush collected significantly more DNA in absolute terms these samples had similar bacterial content to the scrapes and other samples highlighting that the majority of the DNA collected by the self-sample is of non-bacterial origin.We observed a trend towards a lower bacterial content in the cervix compared to the vagina in line with a previous study  that collected vaginal and cervical samples from 100 women and observed higher bacterial load in the vagina measured by qPCR.

The DNA yield of the self-taken sample was significantly higher than that of scrapes cervical brush samples or right fornix flocked swab samples all p-values  0.05.

We also wanted to test how represen- tative the microbiota derived from a self-sampling device is compared to samples taken by a clinician from spatially specified sites in order to estimate the usefulness of the self-sampling device for large-scale microbiota studies.Materials and methodsSubjects and samplingWe sampled the vaginal microbiota of 10 premenopausal women at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Helsinki University Hospital Colposcopy Clinic in Southern Finland with seven different sampling methods summing up to total of 70 samples.

Our results emphasize the fact that the DNA yield from vaginal samples is merely a qualitative readout which can- not be used as an indication of bacterial load or microbiota diversity in the samples.

The Evalynr self-sampling device performed equally well compared to samples taken by a clinician and hence offers a good-quality microbiota sample without the need for a gynecological examination.

The contribution of technical variation introduced by specimen collection and storage DNA extraction and sequencing should also be known and optimally minimized to enable cross-comparison of the different studies and to unmask the underlying biological variation.Previously a study comparing the performance of different sample collection methods for vaginal soluble proteins  found that endocervical swabs and lavage samples collected higher cytokine and antimicrobial protein concentration compared to vaginal swabs.

The Evalyn1 self-sam- pling device Rovers Netherlands developed for hrHPV-testing was included to address the quality of self-collected microbiota samples.

The samples were processed for analysis within 2-10 days from collection.

The samples except for the self-taken sample were collected by three experienced physicians right after insertion of speculum.
