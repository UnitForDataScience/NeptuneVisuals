The urinary metabolic profile indicated a significant reduction in urinary hippurate with treatment which reverted to baseline after cessation of rifaximin although there was no consistent difference in relative abundance of fecal microbiota with treatment.Conclusion These data do not indicate a beneficial effect of rifaximin in patients with NASH.Key words antibiotic hippurate insulin resistance microbiota NAFLD non-alcoholic steatohepatitisINTRODUCTIONON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER disease NAFLD isthe most common cause of liver dysfunction and an increasing cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality globally.12 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its inflammatory and potentially progressive subtype non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH represent a complex disease trait with genetic and environmental influences on incidence and disease progression.23 Although lifestyle measures to achieve sustained weight loss including dietary changes and regular exercise arec 2017 The Japan Society of Hepatology69the mainstay of current management4 many patients do not respond to such measures and specific therapies are lacking.56The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a key metabolic influence in the body and a potentially modifiable environmental target in disorders of energy metabolism and fat storage.7 Mechanisms include increase of calorific yield of meals by co-digestion production of short chain fatty acids and bacterial endotoxin.7-9Microbial interventions such as transfer of cecal contents from conventionally raised mice to germ-free mice have been shown to alter the host phenotype.7 A study in patients with metabolic syndrome showed improved insulin sensitivity in patients receiving a fecal allogenic enteric infusion from a lean donor compared to an autologous infusion.10 Besides direct microbial transfer other methods for alteration of the gut microbiota include use of prebiotics probiotics and antibiotics.11 Antibiotic therapy in obese mice reduced lipopolysaccharides and improved the metabolic phenotype.12 Rifaximin was found to reduce endotoxemia in patients with decompensated cirrhosis associated with improvements in hepatic synthetic function but not aminotransferase values.13Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed broad-spectrum antibiotic that has been found to have clinical utility in a number of gastrointestinal settings with few side- effects.14-16 With standard oral dosing intraluminal drug levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for most bacterial species by up to 250-fold while systemic absorption is 0.4 of the dose.17We hypothesized that modulation of the gut microbiota using rifaximin in humans with NASH would lead to improvement in hepatic inflammation hepatic lipid content and insulin sensitivity.

For example oral administration of a short course of vancomycin reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity in patients with metabolic syndrome in association with reduced gut microbial diversity.29 In another study of patients with cirrhosis before and after rifaximin there was a reduction in the ratio of secondary to primary bile acids31 suggesting a possible mechanism for any rifaximin-induced insulin resistance.

We investigated downstream effects of gut microbiota modulation on markers of hepatic inflammation steatosis and hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in patients with NASH using rifaximin therapy.Methods Patients with biopsy-proven NASH and elevated aminotransferase values were included in this open-label pilot study all receiving 6 weeks rifaximin 400 mg twice daily followed by a 6-week observation period.

Secondary endpoints were change in hepatic lipid content and insulin sensitivity measured with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.Results Fifteen patients 13 men and 2 women with a median range age of 46 32-63 years were included.

Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study and the study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the institution's human research and ethics committee West London REC 2.

Male and female patients were eligible for inclusion if aged between 18 and 70 years with histologically proven NASH as evidenced by the presence of steatosis hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation scored according to Kleiner et al.18 by a single experienced histopathologist RDG within the previous year with or without mild to moderate fibrosis stage 0-34 and with persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase ALT values on at least two occasions in the 3 months prior to recruitment.

Patients were excluded if there was histological evidence of cirrhosis hepatic decompensation regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 unitsweek 16 g ethanolday for a woman or 21 unitsweek 24 g ethanolday for a man evidence of viral autoimmune or other metabolic liver disease on a chronic liver disease screen a history of malignancy or systemic inflammatory conditions myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular events in the preceding 6 months a history of bariatric surgery blind loop or short bowel use of any treatment known or suspected to change bowel flora within 3 months of enrolment or initiation or major dose change of metformin thiazolinediones biguanides statins fibrates anti-obesity medications or insulin within 3 months of enrolment.Study designThis was an open-label study of rifaximin Normix Alfa Wasserman Bologna Italy 400 mg twice daily for 6 weeks followed by a further 6-week observation period during which patients received standard care.

Based on historical data from 20 patients with paired ALT data in response to lifestyle and standard of care intervention from the NAFLD clinic at our institution a sample size of 16 would provide 80 power and a of 0.05 to detect a change in ALT of 25 IUL with an expected standard deviation of the difference of 33 IUL.

Significance of differences in endpoints before and after intervention was tested by the Wilcoxon signed rank test.RESULTSF THE 77 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD evaluated in the clinic over the recruitment period41 met inclusion criteria and were invited to take part in the study.
