All four tested meta-AAC enzymes conferred resistance to gentamicin and sisomicin even at the highest tested concentration 135 mgmL except for meta-AAC0020 which conferred sisomicin resistance only up to 45 mgmL .

2014 Antimicrobial resistance global report on surveillance WHO Geneva.Pehrsson E. C. Forsberg K. J. Gibson M. K. Ahmadi S. and Dantas G. 2013 Novel resistance functions uncovered using functional metagenomic investigations of resistance reservoirs.

Not only is meta-AAC0020 a novel AAC6' enzyme but also the precise spatial orientation of sisomicin in the meta-AAC0020 active site is different than that in previously characterized clinical AAC6' enzymes.

Another possibility is modification of the 2''-OH group to block its interaction with the meta-AAC0020 residue Glu122.Interestingly a homologue of the meta-AAC0020 enzyme 65 identical in sequence could be identified in Eliz- abethkingia anophelis by a BLAST search of the NCBI database accession WP024568394.1.

Overall this analysis showed that while meta-AAC0020 harbors AAC6' activity and places the acetylation site of sisomicin at a spatially conserved position with AAC6' enzymes it possesses distinct molecular binding determinants to recognize the other parts of the 46'- disubstituted aminoglycoside scaffold.DISCUSSIONThe rise of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in the clinic is associated primarily with the activity of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes of which AACs are of particular relevance.

According to our resistance assays meta-AAC0020 is ineffective against amikacin which possessesa hydroxyl group at the 3' position.

It is known that antibiotic resistance can arise through intrinsic resistance i.e.

Characterization ofenvironmental ARGs would allow for linking clinical resistance with the environmental resistome allow evaluation of the potential of these environmental genes to evolve into clinically important ARGs and provide targets for surveillance of potential new and emerging antibiotic resistance determinants.

However AACs are the main source of clinical resistance of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria to essentially all clinically relevant aminoglycosides.To date there have been more than 70 AACs identified in pathogens demonstrating the spread of this resistance mechanism.Many aac genes are encoded in mobile genetic elements i.e.
