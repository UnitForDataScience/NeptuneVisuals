In this review we underline the relationship among inflammation pain microbiota and the different lipids fo- cusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.Keywords Gut brain inflammation IBS pain AEA PEA butyrate mood neurodegenerative disease.INTRODUCTIONThe human body primarily the gastrointestinal GI tract is widely colonized by several species of bacteriaabout 1014 bacterialcells and 500-1000 species col- lectively termed as the human microbiota.

In this study a significant effect of both butyrate-based compounds was shown on inflammatory visceral pain and on neuropathic pain.GUT-BRAIN AXIS CNS DISEASE AND LIP- IDSGut microbiota imbalance is known to influence the CNS functions and viceversa emotional and physio- logical stress can influence gut microbiota through gut- brain axis.Therefore it is a key factor understanding how gut microbes could exert beneficial and therapeutic effect on neurocognitive behaviors.

Based on this background and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids such as the N-acylethanolamine NAE family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine AEA palmitoylethanolamide PEA and oleoile- thanolamide OEA and short chain fatty acids SCFAs such as butyrate belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes.

A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms.

Indeed systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat on the other hand PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease IBD and butyrate producted by gut microbiota is effective in reducing in- flammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models.

Given the high variability of bacterial commu- nities among individuals lately subjects have been classified into three distinct clusters -enterotypes- based on the prevalence of key bacterial genera in their gut microbiota composition i.e.

In fact the gut microbiota contributes to the development of immune system behavior and cog- nition 6 and remarkably concur to maintain normal homeostasis through three major functions i it helps and protects the host against pathogen colonization by nutrient competition and production of active anti- microbial agents such as hydrogen peroxide acido- phylin acidolin lactallin etc.

Interestingly im- balance of the gut microbiota dysbiosis can contrib- ute among others to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disorders IBD 10 and irritable bowel syn- drome IBS 11 commonly described as gut-brain axis disorders.
