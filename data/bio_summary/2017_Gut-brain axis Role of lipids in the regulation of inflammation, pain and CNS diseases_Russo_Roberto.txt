Obesity is usually associated with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota which in turn induce gut barrier dysfunction and increase gut perme- ability 59.

Before birth the human fetal gut is sterile but few hours after delivery all the external stimuli such asAddress correspondence to this author at the Via D.

1.Furthermore the direct or indirect release of signaling molecules such as serotonin norepinephrine and dynorphins cytokines and antimicrobial peptides into the gut lumen underlines that the CNS has an immedi- ate influence on gut microbiota 22.

Specific CB antagonism de-creases gut permeability acting as 'gate keepers' 63.Furthermore it has been proven that specific deletion of NAPE-PLD in adipose tissue induces an obese phe- notype in normal-diet-fed mice characterized by glu-cose intolerance adipose tissue inflammation altered lipid metabolism and affects gut microbiota composi- tion.

Moreover the deletion of the intestinal epithelial Myeloid differ- entiation primary response gene MYD88 which is involved in the signaling of most Toll-like receptors partially protects against obesity diabetes inflamma- tion and disruption of the gut barrier increasing the anti-inflammatory endocannabinoids 2-AG and AEA 68.In addition to these sheer endocannabionoids other related NAEs such as N-palmitoylethanolamine and N-oleoylethanolamine OEA have also shown to modulate gut microbiota.

In this study a significant effect of both butyrate-based compounds was shown on inflammatory visceral pain and on neuropathic pain.GUT-BRAIN AXIS CNS DISEASE AND LIP- IDSGut microbiota imbalance is known to influence the CNS functions and viceversa emotional and physio- logical stress can influence gut microbiota through gut- brain axis.Therefore it is a key factor understanding how gut microbes could exert beneficial and therapeutic effect on neurocognitive behaviors.

Although their presence in normal gut flora results in the increased permeability of the gut wall in depressed patients which may induce their translocation into the systemic circulation leading to behavioral and psychological changes in both animals and humans 178.In contrast mice infection with Campylobacter je- juni or Citrobacter rodentium increases anxiety-like behaviour accompanied by an increase in the neuronal activation marker c-Fos in the CNS 179 180 whereas Trichuris muris displays the same effect through immunological and metabolic mechanisms 32.According to the previous animal studies 181 clinical trials revealed a profound lower expression of various species of the Lachnospiraceae and Rumino- coccaceae families within the phylum Firmicutes in stool samples from patients with depression.

The interaction between the host and its gut micro- biome is a complex relationship whose manipulation could be essential in preventing or treating not only various gut diseases like IBS IBD but also CNS dis- orders such as mood alteration AD PD and autism.

Finally the modulation of gut microbiota or the supplementation with postbiotic molecules restor- ing normal intestinal integrity could be beneficial to peripheral and central disorders related to dysbiosis representing a good strategy to prevent the develop- ment of diseases.LIST OF ABBREVIATIONSNAAAN-acylethanolamine acid amidase NAEN-acylethanolamineNAPE-PLD N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase DOEAOleoilethanolamidePDParkinson's diseasePEAPalmitoylethanolamidePPARPeroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptorsPUFAPolyunsaturated fatty acids SCFAShort chain acidTregsRegulatory T cellsUCUlcerative ColitisWATWhite adipose tissueCONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors confirm that this article content has no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank Giuseppe Russo for the English revision of the manuscript.REFERENCESSchloissnig S Arumugam M Sunagawa S Mitreva M Tap J Zhu A Waller A Mende DR Kultima JR Martin J Kota K Sunyaev SR Weinstock GM Bork P.
