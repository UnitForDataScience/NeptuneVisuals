It is also worth noting the abundance increase of two lactic acid bacteria in the oral cavity Catellicoccus and Lactococcus which can shape the oral community structure by the modulation of abiotic environmental conditions or by direct inter- actions with host immune system or other community members .Even though the sample size was limited we did not observe any correlation between oral vs. faecal microbiota at the within-individual level.

The diversity of the oral microbiota was significantly higher com- pared to the faecal microbiota whereas interindividual variation was higher in faecal than in oral samples.

This analysis was run on a subset of 216 OTUs that were present both in the oral and faecal microbiota of those individuals for which both these samples were available.The LME-based approach was further used to identify OTUs whose abundances differed between oral and faecal samples.

Only 384 34 OTUs were detected in both the oral and faecal micro- biota whereas 541 48 and 202 18 OTUs were detected exclusively in oral and faecal samples respectively.

Clear differences in the composition of oral vs. faecal microbiota wereDiversity of the faecal and oral microbiota of the great tit.

On the other hand OTUs where the most striking relative abundance increase in oral compared to faecal samples Differences in the composition between the oral and faecal microbiota of the great tit.Differences in composition were analysed using adonis whereas differences in interindividual variation were assessed using betadisper.

Column annotations indicate GIT regions whereas row annotations show Phylum-level assignations and if the OTU was overrepresented in oral or faecal samples oral or faecal.

In addition according to adonis analyses there was no effect of these two variables on the com- position of oral or faecal microbiota p  0.2 R2  0.02 in all cases.Analyses on the subset of individuals with both oral and faecal microbiota sampled did not reveal any correlation of the microbial structure between these two GIT regions at the within- individual level.

As studies on other vertebrate species commonly report both higher  and lower  values of alpha diversity in oral vs. faecal microbiota further research should focus on factors driving this variation.At the OTU level the faecal microbiota was characterized by increased abundances of Urea- plasma Deinococcus Carnobacterium Chryseobacterium Delftia and Elizabethkingia OTUs.Ureaplasma together with another Tenericutes OTU corresponding to the genus Mycoplasma that tended to be increased in the faecal microbiota as well qvalue  0.08 are common inhab- itants of vertebrate gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.

These can theoretically include 1 host-intrinsic mechanisms such as effects of the immune sys- tem and other biotic and abiotic factors operating within the GIT or 2 extrinsic sources of variation including pools of bacteria present in the diet and other environmental sources.Relatively low interindividual variation of oral microbiota suggests either that environmen- tal bacterial pools colonizing the oral cavity exhibit high homogeneity in space and time or that there is low interindividual variation in host-specific mechanisms regulating oral micro- biota.
