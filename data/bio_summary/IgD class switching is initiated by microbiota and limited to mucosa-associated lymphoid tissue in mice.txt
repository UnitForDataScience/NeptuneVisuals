we concluded that age-dependent reduction in igd mfi on peripheral blood b cells corresponds to neutrali- zation of the fluorescent-labeled igd antibody by excess serum igd thus trp53bp1-- mice have a hyper-igd phenotype.active igd csr in trp53bp1-- mice occurs in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.

these data indicate that serum igd from trp53bp1-- mice is reactive to intestinal bacteria and suggest that igd responses against commensal bacteria are prominent in the small intestine.signals derived from gut microbiota regulate igd production.

however serum np-specific igd was elevated in trp53bp1--ighb1-8 mice compared with wtighb1-8 mice.thus concerning the spontaneous production of igd in trp53bp1--mice we hypothesized that components of the microbial flora might serve as a driver in a manner similar to immunization.

neither b-cell igd mfi nor serum igd levels were restored toward wt levels in tlr4lps3lps3 and ticam1lps2lps2irak4otioseotiose hosts recon- stituted with bm from trp53bp1-- donors indicating that extrahematopoietic tlr signaling is dispensable for the devel- opment of hyper-igd production by trp53bp1-- b cells fig.

in vivo the quantity of igd-bound colonic bacteria was comparable in wt ighm-- trp53bp1-- and trp53bp1--ighm-- mice but higher levels of igd-coated small intestinal bacteria were detected in trp53bp1-- mice relative to wt ighm-- or trp53bp1--ighm-- mice fig.

s2 a-c. these findings are consistent with a previous report of normal igm and igd expression on b cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of mice with a different null allele of trp53bp1 5. notably we observed reduced mean fluorescence intensity mfi of igd immunostaining on trp53bp-- peripheral blood b cells only when immunostaining was performed in the presence of serum fig.

2 a and b. thus we sought to un- derstand the special function of 53bp1 in the regulation of igd production.secreted igd is produced either from alternative splicing ofpre-mrna encompassing cm and cd exons or from sm-sd csr a process that requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase aid 9. quantitative rt-pcr analysis of im-cd and im-cm transcripts verified that excessive alternative splicing to produce im-cd transcripts did not occur in trp53bp1-- b cells fig.

2 f and g. sm-sd csr in human respiratory mucosa b cells results in gen-eration of igd-producing plasmablasts that secrete igd reactive to respiratory bacteria 9. we hypothesized that secreted igd pro- duced by b cells of the gut mucosa of trp53bp1-- mice may target antigens derived from intestinal microbial flora.

in a flow cytometry assay we measured the binding of serum igd from trp53bp1-- mice to intestinal bacteria isolated from ighm-- mice which pro- duce no igm or igd and iga at levels similar to those in rag2-- mice.

the staining was specific for igd because igd bacteria were absent after incubation with sera from ighm-- and trp53bp1--ighm-- mice or wt littermates.

although trp53bp1-- mice were not deliberately exposed to exogenous antigens in our specific pathogen-free barrier facility they began to produce detectable levels of secreted igd following a latency period from birth to age 4-6 wk during which we detected no changes in igd production.
