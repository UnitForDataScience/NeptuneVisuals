In vivo the quantity of IgD-bound colonic bacteria was comparable in WT Ighm-- Trp53bp1-- and Trp53bp1--Ighm-- mice but higher levels of IgD-coated small intestinal bacteria were detected in Trp53bp1-- mice relative to WT Ighm-- or Trp53bp1--Ighm-- mice Fig.

We concluded that age-dependent reduction in IgD MFI on peripheral blood B cells corresponds to neutrali- zation of the fluorescent-labeled IgD antibody by excess serum IgD thus Trp53bp1-- mice have a hyper-IgD phenotype.Active IgD CSR in Trp53bp1-- Mice Occurs in Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue.

In a flow cytometry assay we measured the binding of serum IgD from Trp53bp1-- mice to intestinal bacteria isolated from Ighm-- mice which pro- duce no IgM or IgD and IgA at levels similar to those in Rag2-- mice.

However serum NP-specific IgD was elevated in Trp53bp1--IghB1-8 mice compared with WTIghB1-8 mice.Thus concerning the spontaneous production of IgD in Trp53bp1--mice we hypothesized that components of the microbial flora might serve as a driver in a manner similar to immunization.

Immunization of WTIghB1-8 or Trp53bp1--IghB1-8 mice with NP hapten conju- gated to lipopolysaccharide NP-LPS a TI type I antigen elicited similar amounts of NP-specific IgM requiring no CSR and reduced amounts of NP-specific IgG requiring cCSR in the serum of Trp53bp1--IghB1-8 mice compared with levels in WTIghB1-8 mice at 14 d after immunization as expected Fig.

The reduced levels of microbiota-derived antigens likely present in the MLNsSMLNs compared with the NALT itself may result in the occurrence of IgD CSR events at a number below the level of detection in WT mice whereas exaggerated IgD CSR induced by the same number of antigens may result in detectable levels of Sm-sd junctions in Trp53bp1-- mice.

These data indicate that serum IgD from Trp53bp1-- mice is reactive to intestinal bacteria and suggest that IgD responses against commensal bacteria are prominent in the small intestine.Signals Derived from Gut Microbiota Regulate IgD Production.
