After doing so we carry out further analyses on the selected 22 common protein sequences of these 43 blood microbes.Kindly note that the consideration of 22 common proteins in the blood microbiome in the current analysis is not arbitrary.

An aggregated phylogeny with respect to 22 common proteins.until the necessity of a separate genus classification is realized in 1984 .Co-existence analysisTo explore the evolutionary closeness of the 22 common micro- biome proteins with human we look for their existence in human.

We do this for all the 22 common proteins and thus we obtain 22 distinct proteins having 22 distinct normalized similarity scores.

Thus we now have 43 tables each consisting of 22 common proteins and its corresponding sequences.Obviously there might be multiple entries of the common pro- teins in each of the dataframes.

The similarity function computes optimal alignment scores for global Needleman- Wunsch and local Smith-Waterman alignments with constant gap penalties.Now we have 43 dataframes and each of them has 22 common proteins and each dataframe is compared with rest of dataframes considering their common proteins.

The homolog analysis is also done with the ConSurf tool.ResultsWe use programs written in R for the preliminary analyses namely finding common proteins between the 43 microbes con- verting each FASTA file to the dataframe and truncating each pro- tein sequence file for a blood microbe to contain only those 22 common proteins.

Thus we get 22 phylogenies corresponding to the common proteins and a single phylogenetic tree by averaging over all these 22 trees.

Therefore the choice of 22 common proteins is made based on some sensitivity analyses.MethodsFor building relationships within the microbiome we perform a sequence based comparative analysis.

The total number of common proteins obtained is 22.

The FASTA sequence files are truncated suitably to contain the sequences of only those 22 common proteins and its variants.
