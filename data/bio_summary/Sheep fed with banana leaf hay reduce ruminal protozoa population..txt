The sheep received ad libitium isoproteic diet with grass vaquero hay and banana leaf hay in equal proportions and forage at a ratio of 5050 based on the dry matter.The banana leaves were harvested and disintegrated in aForage chemical analysisThe determination of DM mineral matter MM total nitro- gen semi-micro Kjeldahl method neutral detergent fiber NDF and acid detergent fiber ADF of the leftovers and of the food offered was performed according to techniques described by Detmann et al.

.Despite the banana leaf hay had low condensed tannin level this vegetal metabolic had showed clear anti-protozoa effects Hristov et al.

ConfinementIntroductionThe agro-industrial residues may represent alternative for rumi- nant feed because ruminal microbiota degrades components of vegetal wall efficiently Nunes et al.

Substitution of corn and soybean with unripe banana fruits and Gliricidia sepium forage in sheep fed hay-based diets effects on intake digestion and growth Archimede et al.

generates significant quantities of agro-industrial waste that may be fed to rumi- nants Heuze et al.

However it has limiting high levels of fiber and phenolic compounds Nunes et al.

Ribeiro et al.

In addition several varieties of banana have tannins Marie-Magdeleine et al.
