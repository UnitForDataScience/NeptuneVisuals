.researches have recorded the role of protozoa in the veg- etal digestion and equilibrium of the rumen ecosystem and health of ruminants newbold et al.

the forages stimulate rumina- tion and saliva secretion contributing to a maintaining of neu- tral ph and equilibrium of rumen protozoa populations martinele et al.

the average of the total protozoa populations was 7.0 x 105 ml-1 raghuvansi et al.

the authors observed a decrease in the concentration of isotricha entodinium diplodinium eudiplodinium and total number of protozoa 5.61 log10g digesta in animals fed with grape residue.the epidinium and ophryoscolex genera are known for the antagonistic relationship established between their popula- tions gocmen et al.

the rumen protozoa suppression can decrease methane production increasing the efficiency of en- ergy utilization by ruminant and improving the animal pro- duction martin et al.

the sheep received ad libitium isoproteic diet with grass vaquero hay and banana leaf hay in equal proportions and forage at a ratio of 5050 based on the dry matter.the banana leaves were harvested and disintegrated in aforage chemical analysisthe determination of dm mineral matter mm total nitro- gen semi-micro kjeldahl method neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf of the leftovers and of the food offered was performed according to techniques described by detmann et al.

.despite the banana leaf hay had low condensed tannin level this vegetal metabolic had showed clear anti-protozoa effects hristov et al.

the protozoa concentration decreased and the bacterialdehority and odenyo  reported diversity of ciliated protozoa populations in ruminants maintained exclusively un- der grazing in relation to those who were fed with concen- trate.

the physicochemical characteristics of rumen fluid and the profile of the rumen protozoa populations were eval- uated for sheep fed banana leaf hay in replacement of the cynodon dactylon cv.

the present study evaluated the physical and chemical characteristics of rumen fluid and the profile of the protozoa population of sheep fed banana leaf hay.materials and methodsanimals and experimental designthe experiment was carried out between april and june at the experimental farm of the state university of montes claros unimontes in the city of janauba in minas gerais brazil.

reducing effect of banana leaf hay treatments on the total count of protozoa and on the populations of entodinium genus ciliates was verified table .
