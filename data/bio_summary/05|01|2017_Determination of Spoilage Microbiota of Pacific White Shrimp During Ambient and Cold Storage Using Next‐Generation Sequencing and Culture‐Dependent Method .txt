the pcr was performed using 7f 5'-cagagtttgatcctggct- 3' and 1540r 5'-aggaggtgatccagccgca-3' univer-sal primers with pcr conditions as follows denaturation at 94 degc for 5 min then 35 amplification cycles with denaturation atfigure 1-photographs of l. vannamei stored at 25 degc a and 4 degc b.94 degc for 30 s primer annealing at 55 degc for 35 s and extension at 72 degc for 1 min finally an extension at 72 degc for 8 min followed by cooling at 4 degc.after sequencing the closest known relatives were searched on genbank in blast.

a good correlation was observed between tvb-n contents and bacterial counts during storage at 4 degc r2  0.97 for to- tal mesophilic counts r2  0.98 for total psychrotrophic counts data not shown indicating that tvb-n was produced mainly by bacterial decomposition of shrimp flesh bahmani and others 2011. a tvb-n value of 30 mg n 100 g has been proposed as an upper acceptability limit for spoilage initiation for fresh shrimp boonsumrej and others 2007. based on the scale the shrimp stored at 4 degc reached the end of their shelf life about 6 d while the shrimp stored at 25 degc were completely spoiled after 1 d of storage.changes of microbiotathe microbial community structure at genus level occurring with a relative abundance above 1 for at least 1 sample is given in figure 5. in this study relative abundance at phylum level was pro- teobacteria 87.5 to 91.2 of all sequences reads bacteroidetesfigure 4-total volatile basic nitrogen tvb-n values of l. vannamei during storage at 25 and 4 degc.

after 6 d of storage the shrimp samples stored at 4 degc showed a readily detectable level of deterioration with obvious melanosis putrid off-odors and soft body and shell which became unacceptable according to the panelists.microbiological growththe results of the changes in the population of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria of pacific white shrimp are shown in figure 3a and b respectively the initial mesophilic and psy- chrotrophic counts were 3.91 and 3.37 log cfug respectivelyfigure 2-changes in sensory quality of l. vannamei stored at 25 and 4 degc.which were slightly lower than the previous study qian and others 2013 2015. the bacterial counts of freshly caught fishery product usually correlate with the farming environment and capture sea- son chaijan 2011 okpala 2014a okpala and others 2014. the bacterial counts of samples stored at 25 degc increased drastically which reached 7.94 - 0.43 and 5.97 - 0.26 log cfug after 24 h respectively.

hm584279 a1 3 cexiguobacteriumaccording to the representative colonies isolated from pcaexiguobacterium acetylicumkf963623 a1 2 c1 1 ctable 1 proteus belong to enterobacteriaceae was the mostdominant genus found in shrimp stored at 25 degc for 1 d but none was found in the fresh shrimp and those stored at 4degc for 6 d. other genera found in fresh and spoiled shrimp samples stored at 4 degc were aeromonas acinetobacter and shewanella.

the high temperature 25 degc is considered to reflect the situation of ambient temperature storage of shrimp and the low temperature 4 degc is used to represent cold storage.sensory analysisthe sensory assessment of shrimp samples stored at 25 and 4 degc was performed by thirty panelists who were graduate students of college of food science and technology shanghai ocean university shanghai p.r.

both the results of ngs and culture-dependent analysis showed the shewanella and acine- tobacter were of high abundance in shrimp stored at 4 degc for 6 d. shewanella species is a known strong spoiler because they can pro- duce h2s trimethylamine tma from trimethylamine n-oxide tmao and amines such putrescine and cadaverine serio and others 2011. they can also favor an anaerobic metabolism in the presence of high co2 which allows them to survive in map con- ditions noseda and others 2012 qian and others 2014. two ad- ditional isolates identified as shewanella putrefaciens and shewanella baltica were described as the most important spoiler during cold storage because of their cold-tolerant ability lo'pez-caballero and moral 2001 mace' and others 2013 even though their optimum growth temperature is about 28 degc to 30 degc.

in gen- eral the sensory properties decreased during storage especially for shrimp stored at 25 degc whose sensory scores decreased from9.85 - 0.06 to 1.02 - 0.80 within 24 h. for shrimp stored at 25 degc the surface color turned pink rather than black and the texture became mushy with extremely strong sulfide smell.

for shrimp stored at 4 degc the decrease in sensory score was much smoother than those stored at 25 degc.

the high proportion of psychrotrophic bacteria in fresh shrimp should be responsible for the spoilage of shrimp during cold storage.changes of tvb-n valuestvb-n may be considered to be a quality index for unpro- cessed fishery products whose increase is related to the activity of spoilage bacteria and endogenous enzymes bahmani and oth- ers 2011. as shown in figure 4 the tvb-n content increased rapidly in samples stored at 25 degc approximately 159.0 mgn 100 g after 1 d of storage while it increased gradually in samples stored at 4 degc approximately 31.4 mgn 100 g after 6 d of stor- age.

both mesophilic and psychrotrophic bac- terial counts were determined by incubation at 30 degc for 48 h bahmani and others 2011 and at 4 degc for 10 d respectively nirmal and benjakul 2011.determination of total volatile basic nitrogen tvb-n contenttvb-n value was determined using the steam-distillation pro- cedure on an automatic kjeldahl apparatus kjeltec analyzer unit foss tecator ab hoganas sweden foss 2002. tvb-n value was expressed as mg n100 g shrimp flesh.identification of microbiota using 16s rrna gene based ngsa 10-fold diluted shrimp samples was centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 degc.

the trays with shrimp samples were separated randomly into 2 groups 1 group was stored at 25 degc and the other at 4 degc.

between-sample beta di- versity was determined by unweighted unifrac analysis lozupone and knight 2005 lozupone and others 2011 computed by the jackknifed beta diversity script.identification of spoilage bacteria by culture-dependent methoda total of 106 isolates originated from fresh shrimp samples and samples stored for 1 d at 25 degc or 6 d at 4 degc were selected from pca media.

given the proposed microbiological limit of 7 log cfug for raw crustaceans icmsf 1986 the acceptable limit of shrimp samples would be reached around days 6 when stored at 4 degc and day 1 at 25 degc.

it can be seen from figure 3c that the psychrotrophic counts accounted for 28.8 of mesophilic counts in fresh shrimp higher than fresh pork sausage 10 benson and others 2014. the proportion of psychrotrophic bacteria to mesophilic bacteria decreased to 1.1 after 1 d of storage at 25 degc while it increased in samples stored at 4 degc.
