The PCR was performed using 7f 5'-CAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCT- 3' and 1540r 5'-AGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3' univer-sal primers with PCR conditions as follows denaturation at 94 degC for 5 min then 35 amplification cycles with denaturation atFigure 1-Photographs of L. vannamei stored at 25 degC A and 4 degC B.94 degC for 30 s primer annealing at 55 degC for 35 s and extension at 72 degC for 1 min finally an extension at 72 degC for 8 min followed by cooling at 4 degC.After sequencing the closest known relatives were searched on Genbank in BLAST.

HM584279 a1 3 cExiguobacteriumAccording to the representative colonies isolated from PCAExiguobacterium acetylicumKF963623 a1 2 c1 1 cTable 1 Proteus belong to Enterobacteriaceae was the mostdominant genus found in shrimp stored at 25 degC for 1 d but none was found in the fresh shrimp and those stored at 4degC for 6 d. Other genera found in fresh and spoiled shrimp samples stored at 4 degC were Aeromonas Acinetobacter and Shewanella.

The high temperature 25 degC is considered to reflect the situation of ambient temperature storage of shrimp and the low temperature 4 degC is used to represent cold storage.Sensory analysisThe sensory assessment of shrimp samples stored at 25 and 4 degC was performed by thirty panelists who were graduate students of College of Food Science and Technology Shanghai Ocean University Shanghai P.R.

In gen- eral the sensory properties decreased during storage especially for shrimp stored at 25 degC whose sensory scores decreased from9.85 - 0.06 to 1.02 - 0.80 within 24 h. For shrimp stored at 25 degC the surface color turned pink rather than black and the texture became mushy with extremely strong sulfide smell.

For shrimp stored at 4 degC the decrease in sensory score was much smoother than those stored at 25 degC.

As shown in Figure 4 the TVB-N content increased rapidly in samples stored at 25 degC approximately 159.0 mgN 100 g after 1 d of storage while it increased gradually in samples stored at 4 degC approximately 31.4 mgN 100 g after 6 d of stor- age.

Based on the scale the shrimp stored at 4 degC reached the end of their shelf life about 6 d while the shrimp stored at 25 degC were completely spoiled after 1 d of storage.Changes of microbiotaThe microbial community structure at genus level occurring with a relative abundance above 1 for at least 1 sample is given in Figure 5.

The trays with shrimp samples were separated randomly into 2 groups 1 group was stored at 25 degC and the other at 4 degC.

Between-sample beta di- versity was determined by unweighted Unifrac analysis Lozupone and Knight 2005 Lozupone and others 2011 computed by the jackknifed beta diversity script.Identification of spoilage bacteria by culture-dependent methodA total of 106 isolates originated from fresh shrimp samples and samples stored for 1 d at 25 degC or 6 d at 4 degC were selected from PCA media.
