the alcohol use disorders identification test audit questionnaire was used to assess harmful alcohol use in aud and control subjects.

a score of 8 and above in men or 5 and above in women identifies both heavy drinkers and those with auds with a sensitivity of 50 -90 and a specificity of 80 35 38. subjects with auds were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria for study entry 1 an audit score greater than or equal to 8 for men or greater than or equal to 5 for women 2 alcohol use within 7 days of enrollment and3 age greater than or equal to 21 yr. aud subjects were not approached for enrollment until sobriety was confirmed by breatha- lyzer.

alcohol consumption has been shown to alter the gastrointestinal and oral microbial commu- nities 24 40 however the impact of alcohol use on the lung microbial communities is not known.

these results support a mechanistic pathway potentially explaining the increased incidence of pneumonia and lung diseases in patients with auds.microbiome respiratory alcohol biogeography lungintroductionrecent studies of the lung microbial communities reveal that a unique lower airway microbiota exists in both healthy indi- viduals and subjects with pulmonary diseases 2 3 16 22 2526 31 41 highlighting the potential influence of microbiota on lung disease pathogenesis.

subjects with auds were recruited between may 2012 and january 2014 at the denver comprehensive addictions rehabilitation and evaluation services center an inpatient alcohol detoxification facility affiliated with denver health and hospital system in denver colorado.

periodontal disease has been linked to several systemic illnesses such as cardiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis suggesting that the microbial communities associated with periodontal disease may influence broader aspects of health 20 29. overall these data support previous work suggesting that alcohol use is associated with a disrupted community structure in the oropharynx.our results provide important insights into the lung micro- bial communities in aud subjects and control populations.

the role of these changes and the nature of the immune response to them will be important areas of future research to illuminate mechanisms of pneumonia pathogenesis and prevention in subjects with auds.acknowledgmentsthe authors thank clients and staff at denver comprehensive addictions rehabilitation and evaluation services as well as personnel from the univer- sity of colorado hospital inpatient clinical and translational research center.grantsthis work was supported by national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism grants r24-aa-019661 p60-aa-009803 and t32-aa-07577l116aud alters the respiratory microbiotanational heart lung and blood institute grant p01-hl076100 nih national center for advancing translational sciences grant ul1tr001082 natio- nal center for research resources grant ctsi-uli-rr025780 and national institute of general medical which funds the louisiana clinical and trans- lational science center grant u54 gm-104940.

recently it was found that gut-associated bacteria were en- riched in the lung microbiome of both an experimental sepsis model as well as in humans with ards suggesting that gut-lung translocation and dysbiosis of the lung microbial communities may contribute to the development of ards 14.the objective of the present study was to compare the microbiota biogeography of the upper and lower respiratory tract in otherwise healthy subjects with auds and matched control subjects.

control subjects were group matched to aud subjects on the basis of age sex and smoking status.
