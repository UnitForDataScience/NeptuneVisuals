A number of years ago I was invited by a famous toxinologist680 Editorialfriend from the Pasteur Institute in Paris for a plateau de fruits de mer in Montparnasse a plateau containing both cooked and uncooked seafood.Image under CreativeCommons 2.0 Licence source The evening was truly memorable not only because of the excellent company the delicious food and very toler- able Sancerre but also because in the evening return TGV almost at my destination I experienced the most explosive... Ms. Repor-Tastory audible noises emanating from the in-ear headphone in her left ear and making frantic facial warning signs... but not of most microbes in the environment and fortu- nately not most pathogens causing infections.

Noitall-Most Oh sorry I am getting carried away Where was I Oh yes but this is perhaps not the worst aspect because you as an individual sitting glum on the toilet may be unfortunate but do not represent a wider problem to the world.

Previously antibiotic resistance was a natural feature of a few bugsSo the connection with your shrimp-mayo wrap is as fol- lows shrimp harvested from pristine waters containing little or no antibiotics may contain a few pathogens and or trace amounts of algal toxins but are not generally hazardous.

However shrimp from some aquaculture oper- ations that use antibiotics as growth promoters may con- tain pathogens some of which may be drug resistant and hence difficult to treat.Ms.

Repor-Tastory looking concerned her right hand migrating involuntarily to her mouth her left hand descending to her abdomen Yes well having had a shrimp-mayo wrap for lunch I imagine this can be an unpleasant surprise.Dr.

Even more important the finding that antibiotics also have prophylactic benefits in animal hus- bandry led to their massive global use in food animal rearing including aquaculture.11 This practice has now contaminated the planet with a class of highly active compounds that inexorably convert our wonderful antibi- otic sensitive friends which carry out so many diverse tasks important to humankind to drug resistance and from which our microbial enemies - the pathogens - acquire their resistance.

Repor-Tastory Wow that vision is really exciting And it means that I will be able to enjoy my shrimp-mayo wraps with impunityDr.

Repor-Tastory So how can we know whether the shrimp comes from pristine or contaminated environ- ments Is the fishmonger-supermarket-restaurant able to tell usDr.

As I mentioned earlier the provenance of some items of food traded globally is problematic and this is particularly true of the products of aquaculture as exem- plified by shrimp.

Repor-Tastory Well that is wonderful So how many different microbes make up this shrimp signatureDr.
