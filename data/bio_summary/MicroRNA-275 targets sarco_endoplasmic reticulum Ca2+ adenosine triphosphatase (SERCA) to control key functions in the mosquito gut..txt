No changes in luciferase activity were observed in cells transfected with the mutated miR-275 binding site psiCHECK-2-DSERCA or the negative control vector psiCHECK-2 in response to the miR-275 mimic .To further confirm SERCA as a miR-275 target in vivo we measured SERCA transcript lev- els in the guts of miR-275-depleted female mosquitoes and observed significant decreases in SERCA mRNA when compared with wt mosquitoes .

Treat- ment of wt mosquitoes with either dsSERCA or the SERCA inhibitor TG created the same phenotype as miR-275 silencing confirming that this miRNA targets SERCA and in turn SERCA is required for the actin cytoskeleton integrity.

To validate the observed pheno- types in SERCA knocked-down mosquitoes we chose thapsigargin TG a highly specific inhibitor of SERCA .

B SERCA RNAi dsSERCA and Notch receptor RNAi dsNR treated mosquitoes exhibited reduced LT protein levels.attention on late trypsin LT which is an essential late-phase digestive protease in guts of female mosquitoes .

RNA interference RNAi-mediated knockdown of SERCA dsSERCA mimicked this adverse LT phenotype in guts of wt mosquitoes when compared with double- stranded RNA of Luciferase dsLuc-treated female mosquitoes .

SERCA and NR dsRNA-treated mosquitoes represent highly similar phenotypes to CP-Gal4UAS-miR-275-TuD female mosquitoes.

Predicted targets between each of the five programs were assessed and only one gene--SERCA--was detected by all five programs .To validate the miR-275 target we assessed the SERCA 3'-UTR response to miR-275 in vitro.

Three reporter constructs psiCHECK-2-SERCA SERCA psiCHECK-2-DSERCA Mutated SERCA and psiCHECK-2 Empty were co-transfected with miR-275 mimic control miRNA control mimic or Drosophila Schneider S2 cell culture medium Non mimic.

Because depletion of miR-275 results in a decrease of SERCA transcript level it appears that miR-275 controls either SERCA transcription or stability of its mRNA.

Thus we have discovered that miR-275 directly targets SERCA and the maintenance of its level is critical for multiple gut functions in mosquitoes.IntroductionFemale hematophagous mosquitoes require vertebrate blood to support rapid egg develop- ment.
