Because of the important link between oral microbiota and oral health we hypothe- size that ecological balance of oral microbiota plays important role in maintaining gingival MSCs function.

To test the effect of oral microbiota on oral MSCs we used a common clinical antibiotic treatment approach to alter oral microbiome ecology in mice and examined whether gingival MSCs function are affected.

This study discloses the impact of microbiota on oral mucosa homeostasis and gingival MSCs proliferation and revealed that microbiome imbalance impairs gingival MSCs proliferation and palatal wound healing through downregulation of Sp1 and TERT via LPS induced miR-21 expression Fig.

We further used gingival MSCs from WT and miR-2122 mice as well as gingival MSCs transfected with miR-21 mimicor inhibitor to examine whether miR-21 controls TERT expres- sion.

We next used gingival MSCs from WT and miR-2122 mice as well as gingival MSCs transfected with miR-21 mimic or inhibitor to test whether miR-21 regulates Sp1 expression.

To further strengthen the conclu- sion that overexpression of miR-21 affects gingival MSCs prolif- eration we used miR-21 mimic and inhibitor to transfect into gingival MSCs derived from mice treated without or without antibiotics respectively.

EdU assay revealed that overexpression of miR-21 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in gingival MSCs from control mice whereas miR-21 inhibition enhanced cell proliferation in gingival MSCs from antibiotics-treated mice Fig.

Some miRNAs including miR- 146 miR-155 and miR-21 are considered as an effector through which commensal bacteria impact the regulation of intestinal homeostasis 21 38. miR-21 has been reported to be induced in response to LPS stimulation in many cell types including macrophages peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts 21 39 40. miR-21 is sug- gested to be an indicator of inflammation 21.

CONCLUSIONWe have shown that treatment of mice oral cavity with anti- biotics leads to changes in the oral microbiome accompaniedby impairment of oral MSCs function in male mice.
