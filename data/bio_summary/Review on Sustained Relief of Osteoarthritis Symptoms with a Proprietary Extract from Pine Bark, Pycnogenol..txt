The oligomers con- sist of catechin and epicatechin units forming chains from dimers up to 12 monomeric units.5In the first step of metabolization the monomers catechin or epicatechin are split from the oligomers and subsequently bacterial activity transforms the monomers into derivatives of d-valerolactone the metabolites M1 and M2.9 As Pycnogenol consists between 65 and 75 of oligomeric procyanidins the formation of the M1 may proceed over several hours because of the stepwise separation of the monomeric units from the pool of oligomers by the activity of the intestinal bacteria.5 This secondary metabolization produces a pro- longed flow of anti-inflammatory substances in addition to the anti-inflammatory phenolic constituents of Pycnogenol.As all of these constituents of Pycnogenol and its me- tabolites exhibit anti-inflammatory actions the progressing appearance of the diverse active substances provides a long- lasting pain relief so that patients feel less pain also during the night.10Hence Pycnogenol's long-lasting action is not based on sustained release from a formulation but by the successive appearance of its diverse anti-inflammatory constituents and metabolites in blood stream.Anti-inflammatory activityThe constituents of Pycnogenol act in concert as all of its phenolic compounds are scavengers of free radicals and exhibit a range of anti-inflammatory actions as documented for ferulic acid caffeic acid catechin and taxifolin.38-14The metabolites formed by ring fission of catechin units by microbiota possess also remarkable anti-inflammatory activity.

unpublished.The reduced anti-inflammatory activity in OA with Pyc- nogenol is reflected in a decrease of C-reactive protein levels in OA patients by 70 with plasma-free radicals simultaneously scavenged by 30.22The cooperation of the diverse anti-inflammatory effects of Pycnogenol in plasma and synovial fluid results in reduction of pain and increased mobility in clinical studies cited below.CLINICAL EFFICACY TRIALSThree identically designed clinical trials investigating the role of Pycnogenol in OA treatment have been published to date.102324ADD-ON PINE BARK EXTRACT FOR OA TREATMENT3Table 1.

The first small-scale study n  35 showed a clear reduc- tion of scores for pain functionality and total WOMAC score dependent on duration of treatment.23 After 3 months signifi- cant P  .001 differences to placebo were observed symptoms were reduced by 43 35 52 and 49 for pain stiffnessphysical function and total WOMAC score respectively.In the second study involving 100 patients the pain score improved significantly P  .004 with time compared to baseline.24 In this study a considerable placebo effect was observed for pain daily activity scores and overall WO- MAC scores and although improvement relative to baseline was highly significant P  .001-P  .03 the difference to placebo did not reach significance level in any case.

Its constituent ferulic acid and the metabolite M1 are enriched in synovial fluid and contribute to local anti-inflammatory action.Pycnogenol as an anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective add-on supplement provided long-lasting positive effects such as enhanced physical mobility and pain relief for patients with mild OA.

A more detailed analysis of the WOMAC scores of the third study revealed a significant reduction P  .05 of nocturnal pain and pain during troublesome stair climbing particularly relevant for the quality of life of OA patients.10 Also for joint stiffness during the day only minor changes were observed with placebo while Pycnogenolimproved stiffness remarkably P  .05.An example for an enhanced physical function refers to the onerous rising from sitting with Pycnogenol the score dropped clearly from initial 3.1 to 0.8 with placebo the score remained nearly unchanged 3.0 to 3.1.The improvement of OA was impressively objectivated by performance of patients on a treadmill.

The procyanidin metabolite M1 showed in vitro a 100 higher activity than hydrocortisone.15 These initial in vitro effects could be proven in ex vivo experiments.Plasma collected from volunteers subsequent to con- sumption of Pycnogenol inhibited the activity of cycloox-ygenases 1 and 2 as well as the activation of the inflammation ''master switch'' nuclear factor kappa B NFjB.15Human pharmacokinetic investigations indicated that the metabolite M1 is enriched in blood cells by active transport mechanisms so that anti-inflammatory activity of blood is most probably 30 times higher than measured in plasma.16 Furthermore the active metabolite M1 ferulic acid and caffeic acid are present in the synovial fluid thus acting directly on the source of inflammation in case of synovitis.17PRECLINICAL INVESTIGATIONProtection of articular cartilageThe progression of OA is connected with a blockage of synthesis of proteoglycan components and type 2 collagen by inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor alpha.18-20 Furthermore cartilage degrading proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases MMPs are liberated as MMP-1 MMP-2 and MMP-13.21 The metabolite M1 formed from the procyanidins of Pycnogenol inhibited the activity of MMP-1 MMP-2 and MMP-9 in vitro and blocked the release of MMP-9 from activated monocytes.15 These chondroprotective effects were confirmed in ex vivo experiments.

Analysis of synovial fluid from OA patients revealed the presence of ferulic acid caffeic acid taxifolin catechin and the metabolite M1 in serum blood cells and synovial fluid.17 The anti-inflammatory substances ferulic acid caffeic acid and the active metabolite M1 were enriched in the syno- vial fluid relative to serum.

Main components with 60-75 oligomeric are procyanidins besides taxifolin catechin and phenol acids.5 The extract distributed worldwide by Hor- phag Research UK Ltd corresponds to the standard of the US Pharmacopeia USP 39.6Sustained releaseIdeally the persistent inflammation causing permanent pain should not be treated by using pain killers occasionally but by a preparation providing a constant anti-inflammatory action.

Because of its favorable safety profile and sustained anti-inflammatory action Pycnogenol represents an option as an add-on supplement for OA patients.KEYWORDS maritime pine extract USP matrix metalloproteases procyanidins osteoarthritis taxifolin WOMAC scoresINTRODUCTIONsteoarthritis OA is predominantly a disease of the elderly affecting primarily the knees and hips.

Sparing the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs supplementation with the pine bark extract reduced gastric complications and hospital admissions of OA patients.
