the oligomers con- sist of catechin and epicatechin units forming chains from dimers up to 12 monomeric units.5in the first step of metabolization the monomers catechin or epicatechin are split from the oligomers and subsequently bacterial activity transforms the monomers into derivatives of d-valerolactone the metabolites m1 and m2.9 as pycnogenol consists between 65 and 75 of oligomeric procyanidins the formation of the m1 may proceed over several hours because of the stepwise separation of the monomeric units from the pool of oligomers by the activity of the intestinal bacteria.5 this secondary metabolization produces a pro- longed flow of anti-inflammatory substances in addition to the anti-inflammatory phenolic constituents of pycnogenol.as all of these constituents of pycnogenol and its me- tabolites exhibit anti-inflammatory actions the progressing appearance of the diverse active substances provides a long- lasting pain relief so that patients feel less pain also during the night.10hence pycnogenol's long-lasting action is not based on sustained release from a formulation but by the successive appearance of its diverse anti-inflammatory constituents and metabolites in blood stream.anti-inflammatory activitythe constituents of pycnogenol act in concert as all of its phenolic compounds are scavengers of free radicals and exhibit a range of anti-inflammatory actions as documented for ferulic acid caffeic acid catechin and taxifolin.38-14the metabolites formed by ring fission of catechin units by microbiota possess also remarkable anti-inflammatory activity.

its constituent ferulic acid and the metabolite m1 are enriched in synovial fluid and contribute to local anti-inflammatory action.pycnogenol as an anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective add-on supplement provided long-lasting positive effects such as enhanced physical mobility and pain relief for patients with mild oa.

a more detailed analysis of the womac scores of the third study revealed a significant reduction p  .05 of nocturnal pain and pain during troublesome stair climbing particularly relevant for the quality of life of oa patients.10 also for joint stiffness during the day only minor changes were observed with placebo while pycnogenolimproved stiffness remarkably p  .05.an example for an enhanced physical function refers to the onerous rising from sitting with pycnogenol the score dropped clearly from initial 3.1 to 0.8 with placebo the score remained nearly unchanged 3.0 to 3.1.the improvement of oa was impressively objectivated by performance of patients on a treadmill.

results are summarized in table 1. the first small-scale study n  35 showed a clear reduc- tion of scores for pain functionality and total womac score dependent on duration of treatment.23 after 3 months signifi- cant p  .001 differences to placebo were observed symptoms were reduced by 43 35 52 and 49 for pain stiffnessphysical function and total womac score respectively.in the second study involving 100 patients the pain score improved significantly p  .004 with time compared to baseline.24 in this study a considerable placebo effect was observed for pain daily activity scores and overall wo- mac scores and although improvement relative to baseline was highly significant p  .001-p  .03 the difference to placebo did not reach significance level in any case.

because of its favorable safety profile and sustained anti-inflammatory action pycnogenol represents an option as an add-on supplement for oa patients.keywords maritime pine extract usp matrix metalloproteases procyanidins osteoarthritis taxifolin womac scoresintroductionsteoarthritis oa is predominantly a disease of the elderly affecting primarily the knees and hips.

sparing the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs supplementation with the pine bark extract reduced gastric complications and hospital admissions of oa patients.

analysis of synovial fluid from oa patients revealed the presence of ferulic acid caffeic acid taxifolin catechin and the metabolite m1 in serum blood cells and synovial fluid.17 the anti-inflammatory substances ferulic acid caffeic acid and the active metabolite m1 were enriched in the syno- vial fluid relative to serum.

patients in the pycnogenol group could increase their walking distance after 3 months from 68 to 198 m whereas placebo expanded walking distance from 65 m just to 88 m.10these positive effects related to relief from daily pain stiffness and physical function had of course a great influ-life was definitely improved in the pycnogenol group.it has to be emphasized that patients were allowed to use their nsaids as concomitant medication when needed.use of nsaids was significantly reduced in all three studies in the pycnogenol group in contrast to a slight in- crease of intake of nsaids in the placebo group.

active metabolites produced by gut microbiota in the intestinal tract from oligomeric procyanidins appear in blood 6 h following ingestion and remain for at least 14 h providing a long-lasting flow of anti-inflammatory substances for relief of oa symptoms.

by far the most widespread symptomatic treatment of oa is the oral or local application of steroidal or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids to fight the chronic local inflammation and pain.the long-term use of oral nsaids may lead to serious unwanted effects as there is a fivefold increased risk formanuscript received 30 january 2017. revision accepted 20 july 2017.address correspondence to prof. dr. peter jorg rohdewald institute of pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry westfalische wilhelms-universitat twenteweg 15 munster 48161 germany e-mail  peter jorg rohdewald 2018 published by mary ann liebert inc. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.peptic ulcers and upper gastrointestinal injuries such as bleeding up to perforation in the intestinal tract.2 further- more nsaids are associated with renal adverse effects high doses may cause kidney failure.2 especially a triple therapy with nsaids and ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with diuretics is at risk for acute kidney injury.3 hence there is a need to substitute or to reduce the use for nsaids by supplementation with a safe standard- ized plant extract.4 furthermore the use of nsaids over a prolonged period of time may increase blood pressure.4pycnogenolrcompositionpycnogenol a standardized extract from the bark of the french maritime pine pinus pinaster aiton consists of a concentrate of polyphenols.

the procyanidin metabolite m1 showed in vitro a 100 higher activity than hydrocortisone.15 these initial in vitro effects could be proven in ex vivo experiments.plasma collected from volunteers subsequent to con- sumption of pycnogenol inhibited the activity of cycloox-ygenases 1 and 2 as well as the activation of the inflammation ''master switch'' nuclear factor kappa b nfjb.15human pharmacokinetic investigations indicated that the metabolite m1 is enriched in blood cells by active transport mechanisms so that anti-inflammatory activity of blood is most probably 30 times higher than measured in plasma.16 furthermore the active metabolite m1 ferulic acid and caffeic acid are present in the synovial fluid thus acting directly on the source of inflammation in case of synovitis.17preclinical investigationprotection of articular cartilagethe progression of oa is connected with a blockage of synthesis of proteoglycan components and type 2 collagen by inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor alpha.18-20 furthermore cartilage degrading proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases mmps are liberated as mmp-1 mmp-2 and mmp-13.21 the metabolite m1 formed from the procyanidins of pycnogenol inhibited the activity of mmp-1 mmp-2 and mmp-9 in vitro and blocked the release of mmp-9 from activated monocytes.15 these chondroprotective effects were confirmed in ex vivo experiments.

these constituents of pycnogenol could be detected in serum blood cells and synovial fluid of oa patients.
