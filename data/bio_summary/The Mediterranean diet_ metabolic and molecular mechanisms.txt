fruits and very small amounts of local cheese were rather regularly consumed together with a moderate intake of red wine during meals .the problem is that since 1950s the composition of the mediterranean diet has changed dramatically and the quality and quantity of food people eat nowadays for example in italy greece and spain has little to do with the traditional mediterranean diet .

after a median follow-up of 4.8 years a total of 288 primary-out- come events occurred of which 83 in the group randomized to a mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts 96 in the group rand- omized to a mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 109 in the control group .

although consuming a mediterranean diet does not require one per se to count calories and intentionally lower energy intake data from randomized clinical trials indicate that substituting refined and processed high glycemic index foods typical of the western diet pattern with minimally pro- cessed plant foods representative of the mediterranean diet results in significant weight loss.

the exact mechanism by which an increased adherence to the traditional mediterranean diet exerts its favorable effects is not known.

however accumulating evidence indicates that the five most important adaptations induced by the mediterranean dietary pattern are a lipid-lowering effect b protection against oxidative stress inflammation and platelet aggregation c modification of hormones and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of cancer d inhibition of nutrient sensing pathways by specific amino acid restriction and e gut microbiota-mediated production of metabolites influencing metabolic health.

historically in many but not all of the 22 countries bordering the mediterranean sea a great abundance and diversity of nonstarchy vegetables minimally processed whole-grain cereals legumes nuts and seeds were staple foods for both men and women .

probably other lifestyle factors such as a dramatic increase in sedentary lifestyle excessive calorie intake psychological stress and pollution might have contributed to the increased inci- dence of these and other chronic diseases in all these mediterranean countries .

in a large epide- miological study involving 22043 men and women higher adherence to a traditional mediterranean diet was associated with a significant lower total cardiac and cancer mortality independently of the indi- vidual dietary components .

in another study of 2339 european men and women aged 70 to 90 years adherence to a mediterranean diet was associated with a 23 lower rate of all-causes mortality .

in these studies the adherence to the mediterranean diet was calcu- lated based on a dietary score which integrated relatively high intakes of whole-grain cereals beans vegetables fruits nuts fish and mono- unsaturated fat oils relatively low intakes of meat including poultry and dairy products and moderate consumption of alcohol.
