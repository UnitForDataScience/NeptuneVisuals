did not report the stool consistency of the infants in the study although they speculated that the infants with colic infants might have had minor water content in their faeces compared with controls based on the lower total faecal-bacteria counts in their samples.

This showed that the faeces of infants with colic contained a lower number of total bacteria than the infants without colic together with a relative abundance of Escherichia coli group bacteria and higher levels of ammonia.

However there were no differ- ences in the number of Bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus- Enterococcus group between the groups.These new data on formula-fed colic infants are in linewith the earlier studies on breast-fed infants except for the findings regarding Bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.

Bifidobacteria have been reported to dominate the gut microbiota of breast-fed infants while the microbiota in the guts of formula-fed infants have been reported to be more diverse.

In our opinion this further research would be worth doing despite the fact that breastfeeding has not been shown to provide a protective effect on the develop- ment of infantile colic and the incidence of infant colic is similar among formula-fed and breast-fed infants 7.EditorialEditorialOne of the most promising new advances in the management of infant colic is using probiotics to modulate the gut microbiota especially Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 which has been proven to be effective in breast-fed infants with colic 8.

's latest work 6 the type of feeding may influence the gut microbiota composition of infants with colic and thus contributing to the ineffectiveness of the probiotic in formula-fed infants.

These two factors were possible confounding factors in the current study as all the infants with colic were on simethicone 100 or cimetropium 92 while only 5 of the control infants without colic were on simethicone 6.

This results in an imbalance in mirobiota dysbiosis which in turn may ultimately bring about alterations in neuronal function namely pain sensations 5.Infants with colic have decreased faecal-bacterial diver- sity and stability compared with the infants without colic and they also have higher faecal counts of gram-negative bacteria especially coliform bacteria 4.

The numbers of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria have also been reported to be reduced in colic in comparison with the healthy infants 4.

It is important to note that all the studies have focusedon the gut microbiota composition of breast-fed infants with colic and there are no data on formula-fed infants.In this issue of Acta Paediatrica a cross-sectional study by Savino et al.
