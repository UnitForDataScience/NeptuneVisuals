This study found that NaB significantly corrected the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by HFD restored intestinal mucosa damage improved tight junction structure finally reduced gut endotoxin into liver and attenuated HFD induced steatohepatitis.ApplicationsThe results suggested that gut metabolite NaB had the ability to reverse HFD-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota and finally attenuated HFD-induced steatohepatitis which indicated the potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of NAFLD.TerminologyShort chain fatty acids also referred to as volatile fatty acids are mainly produced by the fermentation of gut microbiota and have fewer than 6 carbon atoms including formic acid acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid isobutyric acid valeric acid and isovaleric acid.Peer-reviewThe study of Zhou et al is an interesting study describing sodium butyrate attenuation of high-fat diet-induced steatohepatitis in mice.

Liver inflammation and fat accumulation were ameliorated the levels of TG and cholesterol in liver were decreased after NaB intervention NAS score was significantly decreased metabolic indices such as FBG and HOMA-IR and liver function indicators ALT and AST were improved compared with HF group.CONCLUSIONNaB may restore the dysbiosis of gut microbiota to attenuate steatohepatitis which is suggested to be a potential gut microbiota modulator and therapeutic substance for NAFLD.Key words Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Sodium butyrate Gut microbiota Gastrointestinal barrier Endotoxinc The Authors 2017.

However many apparently contradictory results demonstrate the complexity of the interactions among the gut microbiota butyrate concentration and host energy metabolism14 the further interactions among NAFLD gut microbiota and its metabolites still need more investigations to clarify15.We hypothesized that sodium butyrate NaB supplementation alone would attenuate high-fat diet HFD-induced steatohepatitis in mice via modulation of gut microbiota.

These bacteria can produce butyric acid in what seems like a virtuous circle.Innovations and breakthroughsTo elucidate the effects of HFD and NaB on the composition of the microbiota and further clarify the effect of gut metabolite sodium butyrate NaB on NAFLD Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA from gut microbiota was conducted and analysed and further metabolism indices liver and small intestine histologies were evaluated.

Our results showed that NaB treatment protected mice against HFD-induced liver fat accumulation and inflammation improved gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by HFD and attenuated gut microbiota-derived endotoxin-induced liver injury.

In addition we found that both PPAR-a Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-a andPPAR-g expression either in the HF or the HF  NaB group were significantly reduced compared with the control Figure 5B.NaB ameliorated inflammation and fat accumulation inthe liver of HFD-fed miceAfter 16 wk the end point the HF group had higher NAS 5.67 - 0.225 vs 0.20 - 0.145 and 4.42 -0.358 steatosis 3.00 vs 0 and 2.17 - 0.112inflammation 0.75 - 0.217 vs 0.06 - 0.066 and0.50 - 0.150 and ballooning scores than the control and HF  NaB groups 1.92 - 0.083 vs 0.13 - 0.091 and 1.75 - 0.131 Table 1.

However the HF  NaB group displayed a significantly improved whole body and liver profile than the HF group Figure 1A.The HF group displayed significantly higher liver and epididymal fat indices elevated fasting blood glucose a higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance HOMA-IR and a lower insulin sensitivity index ISI than the control group Figure 1.

It decreased the intestinal permea- bility to reduce the escape of pathogen-associated molecular patterns into the blood thus we comfirmed that no matter serum or liver endotoxin derived from gut microbiota was significantly decreasedcompared with HF group Toll-like receptor 4 TLR4 a receptor of lipopolysaccharide LPS or endotoxin and its downstream protein Myd88 were significantly decreased in the liver after NaB treatment.

Gut microbiota from each group were detected at baseline and at 16 wk liver histology were evaluated and gastrointestinal barrier indicator such as zonula occluden-1 ZO-1 were detected by immunohistochemistry and realtime-PCR further serum or liver endotoxin were determined by ELISA and inflammation- or metabolism-associated genes were quantified by real-time PCR.RESULTSNaB corrected the HFD-induced gut microbiota imbalance in mice while it considerably elevated the abundances of the beneficial bacteria Christensenellaceae  Blautia and Lactobacillus .

Although there was no significant difference between the control and the HF group ZO-1 expression was significantly increased in the HF  NaB group compared with either the control or the HF group Figure 2D.Gut microbiota variations in response to diet or NaB interventionTo elucidate the effects of diet and NaB on the com- position of the microbiota we conducted Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA at baseline and at 16 wk after treatment.
