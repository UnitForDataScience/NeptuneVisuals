Several bariatric procedures including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB duodenal-jejunal bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy have shown to decrease hedonic responses to highly palatable foods and to affect dopamine release in the striatum 20-23.By assessing changes in food intake and hedonic eating after bariatric surgery and their relationship with the gut microbiome we aimed to test the following hypotheses 1 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy LSG results in distinct changes in gut microbial com- position which are able to discriminate between pre- and postsurgi- cal status 2 alterations in gut microbial composition are related to weight loss and 3 these gut microbial changes are associated with changes in ingestive behaviors that are conducive to weight loss.METHODSStudy SampleEight obese right-handed female adult study participants age  39.5 8.7 years body mass index BMI  44.1 5.6 kgm2 were recruited before undergoing LSG at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles from June 2014 to June 2015.

Alterations in gut microbiome were significantly associated with weight loss and with reduced hedonic eating after surgery however a larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.Key words appetite bariatric surgery food addiction gut microbiome hedonic eating sleeve gastrectomy.INTRODUCTIONariatric surgery is currently the most effective intervention for the treatment of obesity 1.

We explored the following hypotheses 1 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy LSG results in changes in gut microbial composition 2 alterations in gut microbiota are related to weight loss 3 alterations in gut microbiome are associated with changes in appetite and hedonic eating.Methods Eight obese women underwent LSG.

Noticeably all members of this signature expe- rienced a rise in their abundance after surgery.Postoperative changes in the relative abundance of members ofthe microbial signature correlated with changes in clinical vari- ables.

It remains to be determined whether this microbial signature is sustained over time and whether it is the result of adaptive changes to the new anatomy or a re- sponse to postoperative changes in diet.

 ORIGINAL ARTICLESurgically Induced Changes in Gut Microbiome and Hedonic Eating as Related to Weight Loss Preliminary Findings in Obese Women Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryClaudia P. Sanmiguel MD Jonathan Jacobs MD PhD Arpana Gupta PhD Tiffany Ju BA Jean Stains RN Kristen Coveleskie PhD Venu Lagishetty PhD Anna Balioukova RN Yijun Chen MD Erik Dutson MD Emeran A. Mayer MD PhD and Jennifer S. Labus PhDABSTRACTObjective Weight loss surgery results in significant changes in the anatomy function and intraluminal environment of the gastrointestinal tract affecting the gut microbiome.

Although bariatric surgery results in sustained weight loss decreased appetite and hedonic eating it is unknown whether the surgery-induced alterations in gut microbiota play a role in the observed changes in hedonic eating.

LSG pro- duced changes in the gut microbiota abundance at the phylum level with a highly significant increase in Fusobacteria log2FC  4.0 q  4.1E-07 and a significant reduction in the Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio p  .008 due to decreased Firmicutes log2FC  -.71 q  .0055 after surgery Fig.

Reduced desire to eat sweets after surgery was inversely correlated with changes in the abundance of Bulleidia p  -.841 p  .036 and TG5 p  -.812 p  .049.Microbial Interactions With Weight Loss and Eating BehaviorsWe explored whether intestinal bacterial profiles were associated with BMI body composition body fat mass hunger levels andTABLE 2.

It is possible that the Postbariatric Microbiome and Hedonic Eating observed prominence of Bacteroides after surgery reflects changes in diet and a decreased availability of intraluminal nutrients.
