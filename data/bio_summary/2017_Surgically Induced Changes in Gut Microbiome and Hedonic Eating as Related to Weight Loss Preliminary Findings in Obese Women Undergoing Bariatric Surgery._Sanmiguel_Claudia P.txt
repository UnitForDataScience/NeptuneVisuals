QIIME allows analysis of high-throughput community sequencing data.

Several bariatric procedures including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB duodenal-jejunal bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy have shown to decrease hedonic responses to highly palatable foods and to affect dopamine release in the striatum 20-23.By assessing changes in food intake and hedonic eating after bariatric surgery and their relationship with the gut microbiome we aimed to test the following hypotheses 1 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy LSG results in distinct changes in gut microbial com- position which are able to discriminate between pre- and postsurgi- cal status 2 alterations in gut microbial composition are related to weight loss and 3 these gut microbial changes are associated with changes in ingestive behaviors that are conducive to weight loss.METHODSStudy SampleEight obese right-handed female adult study participants age  39.5 8.7 years body mass index BMI  44.1 5.6 kgm2 were recruited before undergoing LSG at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles from June 2014 to June 2015.

Alterations in gut microbiome were significantly associated with weight loss and with reduced hedonic eating after surgery however a larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.Key words appetite bariatric surgery food addiction gut microbiome hedonic eating sleeve gastrectomy.INTRODUCTIONariatric surgery is currently the most effective intervention for the treatment of obesity 1.
