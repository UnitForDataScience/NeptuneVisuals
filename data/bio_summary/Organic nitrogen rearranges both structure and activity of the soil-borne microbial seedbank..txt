Thus monitoring changes in both the soil microbial community structure and activity of the soil microbial community after appli- cation of organic fertilizers is essential for understanding not only the soil nutrient availability especially nitro- gen but also for understanding how the organic amendment affects community stability.

However to date no studies have investigated such microbial shifts caused by organic amendments.We hypothesize that organic amendments induce qualitative changes to the microbial soil community and that this shift in community is stronger with respect to the active community component than for the entire microbial seedbank.

Accordingly in order to understand the influences of organic amendments on the soil micro- bial community researches need to take into account how changes in the active microbial community further influence the overall composition of the microbial community itself in terms of resilience and resistance.

However the amount of organic amendment applied to the soil microbial community showed resilience and changes in the microbial community over time remained a minor effect.Moreover as shown by the MFA results changes in the fungal community both classified and unclassified explained part of the total data variability.

As a consequence some soil microbial populations might face resource competition during decomposition that can change the community structure according to changing available resources.Recent studies have contributed to our understanding of organic decomposition by describing soil organic matter formation and chemical composition of stable C and N formsand have highlighted the roles of both labile and recalcitrant plant compounds.

Finally we discuss how changes in microbial community activity can interfere with community stability of the soil microbial seedbank.ResultsOrganic amendment effect on microbial community structure and activity.

Therefore our choice of sampling periods was intended to avoid compromising the analysis of organic amendment quality in the soil microbial community.However to determine when the effect of exogenous community ceases and the effect of nutrient addition begins remains an open question for future investigations that can make use of more intensive monitoring.Not all microorganisms in soil are active many exist in a dormant state and prolong resumption of activ- ity until appropriate environmental conditions are present.

Our results suggest that organic amendments shape the soil microbial community structure through a feedback mechanism by which microbial activity responds to changing organic inputs and rearranges composition of the microbial seedbank.
