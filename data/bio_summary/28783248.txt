animal samples were treated similarly as previously reported hagi et al.

the 16f515 primer 50 tatggtaattgtgtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 30 was used across all samples while 51 barcoded 16r803 primers were each used on the 36 intestine samples and 15 environment samples identi- cal linker primer sequence 50 agtcagtcagccggac tachvgggtwtctaat 30 plus 12 nucleotides of dis- tinctive barcodes at 50 end.

our study points to a nonempirical selection process by which host-specific probiotics can be developed.introductionthe decline in wild fish and shellfish stocks combined with a growing demand for seafood has encouraged the sustained and rapid growth of aquaculture worldwide naylor et al.

to control the repeating and the emerging pathogens antibiotics are commonly overused which can lead to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and pose high risks topublic health and the environment xu et al.

traditional development of probiotics usually starts from the acquisition of bacterial strains followed by in vitro screening pilot-scale in vivo experiments and pathogenic- ity tests towards target organisms and other involved trophic levels verschuere et al.

however the traditional cultivation-depen- dent approach often posed dubious sensitivity and detected only a limited fraction of microbial communities kim et al.
