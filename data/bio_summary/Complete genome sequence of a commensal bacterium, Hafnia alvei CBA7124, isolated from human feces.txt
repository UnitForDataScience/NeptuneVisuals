In addition we used the orthoANI values with the genome sequence of H. alvei.Results and discussionGenome characteristicsThe analysis of the whole genome sequence of H. alvei CBA7124 revealed a single circular chromosome with 4585298 bp after quality control of 150292 raw reads with an average read length of 5885 bp Table .

These results indi-cated that the genome of strain CBA7124 was separatefrom but highly homologous to that of other H. alveigenomes.Antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance genesIn the genome of strain CBA7124 12 kinds of subsystems were found to be associated with the subcategory resist- ance to antibiotics and toxic compounds on the SEED database.

A 20-tmkb sequencing libraryQuality assuranceBefore the genome sequencing the identity of the H. alvei CBA7124 strain was verified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and cell morphology analysis Additional file  Figure S1.

In addition the overproduction of the toxin of yoeB is known to inhibit the growth of E. coli  .Future directionsWe described a genome sequence of H. alvei a known opportunistic pathogen isolated from a Korean fecal sample.

This genome was found to have strain-specific singletons through comparative genomic analysis with the other H. alvei strains.

However further in vivo studies are needed to characterize the pathogenicity of H. alvei.Additional fileAbbreviationsCDS protein coding gene COG clusters of orthologous groups POG pan- genome orthologous group orthoANI orthologous average nucleotide iden- tity RAST rapid annotation using subsystem technology TA toxin-antitoxin.Authors' contributionsYDN and SWR designed and coordinated all the experiments.
