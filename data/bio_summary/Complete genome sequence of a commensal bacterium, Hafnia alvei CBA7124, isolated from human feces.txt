in addition we used the orthoani values with the genome sequence of h. alvei.results and discussiongenome characteristicsthe analysis of the whole genome sequence of h. alvei cba7124 revealed a single circular chromosome with 4585298 bp after quality control of 150292 raw reads with an average read length of 5885 bp table .

these results indi-cated that the genome of strain cba7124 was separatefrom but highly homologous to that of other h. alveigenomes.antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance genesin the genome of strain cba7124 12 kinds of subsystems were found to be associated with the subcategory resist- ance to antibiotics and toxic compounds on the seed database.

the genome coverage was found to be 168.69-fold and the gc content was 48.8. the genome contained 25 rrna genes 9 5s rrna genes 8 16s rrna genes and 8 23s rrna genes and 88 trna genes.

the genome was assembled according to the protocol in the hierarchical genome assembly process version 2 with pacbio smrt analysis version 2.3 and polishing was performed with quiver.

the complete genome sequence of h. alvei cba7124 would improve our understanding of different strains of oppor-correspondence young-do nam and seong woon roh contributed equally to this work1 microbiology and functionality research group world institute of kimchi gwangju 61755 republic of koreafull list of author information is available at the end of the articletunistic infectious pathogens.c the authors 2017. this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license  which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.

in addition the identity of the strain cba7124 was confirmed through analysis of the 16s rrna gene obtained after genome sequencing.

the genome con- tained 4043 protein-coding genes cdss and 3838 genes were allotted to 18 cog functional categories.

in addition the antimicrobial resistance gene blaacc-3 was also found to be associated with the beta-lactam resistance ampc- type gene from the resfinder server.toxin-antitoxin systemsseveral toxin-antitoxin ta systems were annotated in the genome of hafnia alvei for stabilization based on the seed database.
