in this article the author used olfactory impairment and rbd as examples to illustrate the promises and challenges of epidemiologic research on prodromal symptoms to understand pd etiology.keywords epidemiology parkinson's disease olfaction disorders rem sleep behavior disorder risk factors smokingintroductionthe past two decades have seen evolutionary advances in understanding the genetics of complex diseases including parkinson's disease pd.

we expect these large cohort studies together with clinical and epidemio- logic efforts on phenotypical conversion will bring answers to fundamental questions about pd etiology and beyond.acknowledgmentsthe author is supported by a start-up fund from the michigan state university ge100455.conflict of interestthe author has no conflict of interest to report.referenceschang d nalls ma hallgr'imsdo'ttir ib hunkapiller j van der brug m cai f international parkinson's disease genomics consortium 23 and me research team kerch- ner ga ayalon g bingol b sheng m hinds d behrens tw singleton ab bhangale tr graham rr 2017 a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identi- fies 17 new parkinson's disease risk loci.
