We expect these large cohort studies together with clinical and epidemio- logic efforts on phenotypical conversion will bring answers to fundamental questions about PD etiology and beyond.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author is supported by a start-up fund from the Michigan State University GE100455.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe author has no conflict of interest to report.REFERENCESChang D Nalls MA Hallgr'imsdo'ttir IB Hunkapiller J van der Brug M Cai F International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium 23 and Me Research Team Kerch- ner GA Ayalon G Bingol B Sheng M Hinds D Behrens TW Singleton AB Bhangale TR Graham RR 2017 A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identi- fies 17 new Parkinson's disease risk loci.

Despite recent successes in understanding the genetics of Parkinson's disease PD the causes of late-onset sporadic PD remain elusive.
