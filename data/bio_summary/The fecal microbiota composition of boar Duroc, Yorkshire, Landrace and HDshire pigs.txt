Principal coordinate analysis of fecal bacteria revealed that the Landrace and Yorkshire breeds had high similarity and were clearly separated from the Duroc and Hampshire breeds.Conclusion Overall this study is the first time to compare the fecal microbiomes of four breeds of boar pig by high-throughput sequencing and to use Spearman's rank correlation to analyze competition and cooperation among the core bacteria.Keywords Boar Breed Fecal Microbiota High-throughput Sequencing Short-chain Fatty AcidsINTRODUCTIONThe pig gastrointestinal tract harbors thousands of species of bacteria whose composition and relative proportions vary depending on the animal breed animal age and nutritional and environ- mental factors 1.

However given the diverse relationships between boar pig pro- perties and gut microbiome function further study is needed to reveal the contribution of gut microbiome and its metabolic pro- ducts to an animal's economic characteristics.To assess the influence of pig breed on shaping the gut micro- biota and to determine whether these breeds share core bacteria or have breed-specific bacteria we chose twenty-three boar pigs Duroc  6 Hampshire  4 Landrace  7 Yorkshire  6 repre- senting four breeds and diverse genetic backgrounds.

For example Duroc had 16 specific OTUs Landrace had 41 Yorkshire had 27 and Hampshire hadThe associations of these specific OTUs with pig genetics and gut ecology warrant further research.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have suggested that pig breed affects the com- position of Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and sulfate-reducing bacteria which are higher in Chinese native pig breeds than in foreign breeds 2.

The contribution of these co-occurring genera and co-excluding genera as revealed in this study may have some fundamentally important function and must be researched deeply.SCFAs pH and cellulose activity of the fecal microbiota of the four pig breedsWe also measured the SCFAs pH and cellulose activity of the fecal microbiota of the four breeds of pig Figures 4 5.

Submitted Sept 30 2016 Revised Dec 16 2016Accepted Feb 16 2017Objective To investigate the effect of host genetics on gut microbial diversity we performed a structural survey of the fecal microbiota of four purebred boar pig lines Duroc Landrace Hampshire and Yorkshire.Methods The V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced.

The Landrace breed was developed in Denmark by crossing the native pig with the Large White and has white skin.

Some gut bacteria of pigs suchas Clostridium Bacillus Ruminococcus and Bacteroides produce cellulases to help their host digest diet fibers.Different abundant bacteria and principal coordinate analysis of the four pig breedsThe abundance distribution of the dominant 35 genera among the four breeds was displayed in a species abundance heatmapFigure 6.

The representative sequences were dis- tributed into phyla and genera according to the SILVA bacteria database SILVA version 108 Silva Bremen Germany following the Bayesian approach and using a cutoff of 97.

The values of the Shannon and ACE indexes suggest that most of the fecal bacteria were captured Table 1.At the phylum level Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated the majority of the fecal microbiota regardless of breed.
