principal coordinate analysis of fecal bacteria revealed that the landrace and yorkshire breeds had high similarity and were clearly separated from the duroc and hampshire breeds.conclusion overall this study is the first time to compare the fecal microbiomes of four breeds of boar pig by high-throughput sequencing and to use spearman's rank correlation to analyze competition and cooperation among the core bacteria.keywords boar breed fecal microbiota high-throughput sequencing short-chain fatty acidsintroductionthe pig gastrointestinal tract harbors thousands of species of bacteria whose composition and relative proportions vary depending on the animal breed animal age and nutritional and environ- mental factors 1. gut bacteria influence nutrient absorption and the health of the host 23 such as vitamin synthesis and short-chain fatty acid scfa production 4. in particular genetic back- ground is strongly associated with the host's gut microbial taxa and characteristics 24.hampshire landrace duroc and yorkshire are the most frequently used pigs in commercial production and have favorable growth performance.

therefore these breeds of pigs may exhibit breed-specific microbial diversity 27. the1456copyright c 2017 by asian-australasian journal of animal sciencesthis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license which permits unrestricted non-commercial use distribution and repro- duction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.illumina sequencing platform yields longer deoxyribonucleic acid dna reads at lower cost compared to other platforms and pro- vides more abundant information on bacterial communities 3. however given the diverse relationships between boar pig pro- perties and gut microbiome function further study is needed to reveal the contribution of gut microbiome and its metabolic pro- ducts to an animal's economic characteristics.to assess the influence of pig breed on shaping the gut micro- biota and to determine whether these breeds share core bacteria or have breed-specific bacteria we chose twenty-three boar pigs duroc  6 hampshire  4 landrace  7 yorkshire  6 repre- senting four breeds and diverse genetic backgrounds.

for example duroc had 16 specific otus landrace had 41 yorkshire had 27 and hampshire hadthe associations of these specific otus with pig genetics and gut ecology warrant further research.discussionprevious studies have suggested that pig breed affects the com- position of firmicutes bacteroidetes and sulfate-reducing bacteria which are higher in chinese native pig breeds than in foreign breeds 2. both genetic and cage effects are significantly associated with microbiota composition 15. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were abundant phyla in the fecal bacterial community at pre- weaning 16 post-weaning and four years of age 12 but changed as pigs aged.

some gut bacteria of pigs suchas clostridium bacillus ruminococcus and bacteroides produce cellulases to help their host digest diet fibers.different abundant bacteria and principal coordinate analysis of the four pig breedsthe abundance distribution of the dominant 35 genera among the four breeds was displayed in a species abundance heatmapfigure 6. species abundance heatmap showing normalized values of 35 differentially abundant genera of four boar pig breeds.

the different colors represent the range of r from -1 to 1. orange indicates a perfect positive correlation whereas green indicates a perfect negative correlation.in yorkshire 2.57 but less abundant in landrace 2.21 p 0.05. bacteroides was less abundant in landrace whereas rumi- nococcus was more abundant in hampshire but these differences were not significant.spearman's rank correlation test was used to analyze the co- occurrence patterns among the nine core bacteria figure 3. some bacteria were positively correlated with each other.

these results may reflect multiple mechanisms such as secretory products and competition for nutrients 14. the contribution of these co-occurring genera and co-excluding genera as revealed in this study may have some fundamentally important function and must be researched deeply.scfas ph and cellulose activity of the fecal microbiota of the four pig breedswe also measured the scfas ph and cellulose activity of the fecal microbiota of the four breeds of pig figures 4 5. the bu-figure 4. distribution of short-chain fatty acids scfas of the four boar pig breeds.

landrace has bigger size and faster growing rate but low ability of resistance to disease 5. overall male pigs utilize feed more effi- ciently and have profitable production characteristics but few studies have compared the fecal bacteria compositions of these four boar breeds 6. in this study the four purebred boar pig lines were housed in a controlled environment and fed the same diet.

with the help of sequence statistics we identified ten predominant genera that co-occurred in all pig breeds and several breed-specific bac- teria that may be potentially functional microorganism to pig breeds.materials and methodssample collection and dna extractionfresh fecal samples were collected from four purebred boar pigs approximately 300 days of age.

a previous study showed that prevotella decreased from 30 of all bacteria to 4.0 as pigs aged these bacteria degrade mucin and xylan which might be helpful in feed digestion 1112. the abundance of the genus lactobacillus 11.1 was markedly greater in duroc pigs than in the other three breeds p0.05 in contrast to a previous study that observed that the abundance of lactobacillus was highest in land- race pigs 7. the abundance of the clostridium genus differed among the four breeds and was highest in yorkshire 14.2 and lowest in hampshire 6.67 p0.05.

for example prevotella and lactobacillus were significantly correlated with each other rho  0.458 and with other bacteria such as coprococcus rho  0.442 0.261 bacteroides rho  0.445 0.312 and streptococcus rho  0.218 0.28. clostridium was positively correlated with turicibacter rho  0.679 but negatively correlated with the other six bacteria.

in contrast to previous findings for human gut bacteria 13 co-occurrence between prevotella and ruminococcus was observed in the four pig breeds rho  0.287and we observed co-exclusion of prevotella and clostridium rho -0.723 turicibacter rho  -0.705 and oscillospira rho -0.421. as shown in figure 5 streptococcus prevotella and lactobacillus co-occurred and cooperated to suppress three other cooperative genera clostridium turicibacter and oscillospira.

however another study re- ported that prevotella had a greater abundance in lean ossabaw minipigs whereas clostridium was more abundant in obese ossabaw minipigs 17. similar clustering of bacteria in pigs of the same age was observed in different breeds of pigs 12. oscillo- spira an enigmatic bacterial genus that has never been cultured and is positively correlated with leanness and health has been detected frequently in the human gut 20. from the spearman's rank correlation a perfect positive correlation indicates that these bacteria cooperated with each other whereas perfect negative correlation represents suppression.

spearman's rank correlation provides valuable and complementary information.host genetics have an important influence on microbial di- versity 19 and breed-specific bacteria 7. bacillus subtilis by-2 which produces cellulose has been isolated from the intestine of tibetan pigs whose diet consists of forage grass 21 suggesting that the function of gut bacteria depends on the genome of the host breed.

the genus lacto- bacillus can produce lactic and other acids such as scfas and therefore exhibits great importance for host health 2. however these bacterial genera require extensive research for both genomic and functional characterization.conclusionoverall we first compared the fecal microbiota of the four breeds of boar pig by high-throughput sequencing and identified nine core bacteria that may contribute to host digestion and health.
