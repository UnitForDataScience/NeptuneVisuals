Ph.D.he irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a chronic and sometimes disabling functional bowel disorder.12 Traditionally this functional diag- nostic label has been applied when no obvious structural or biochemical abnormalities are found but emerging evidence suggests that distinct patho- physiological disturbances may account for the symptoms and that IBS is unlikely to be one disease or merely a psychiatric somatosensory disorder.2 The Rome IV criteria1 derived from a consensus process by a multinational group of experts in functional gastrointestinal disorders constitute the current standard for diagnos- ing IBS.

Opiates should be avoided since their use increases the risk of the narcotic bowel syndrome a variant of opioid- induced bowel dysfunction in which recurrent abdominal pain develops with increasing doses of opioid drugs.75 A combination of gut-directed and central drug treatment plus psychological therapy appears to be helpful in minimizing key symptoms.76 Patients with symptoms that are difficult to manage may request fecal microbial transfer.

Pilot study of small bowel mucosal gene expression in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.

It has been esti- mated that patients would give up 10 to 15 years of life expectancy for an instant cure of the disease.3 The prevalence of IBS in the United States is between 7 and 16 and the condition is most common in women and young people.4 Direct costs associated with IBS in the United States have been estimated conservatively at more than 1 billion.5 Thus diagnosing IBS accurately minimizing invasive inves- tigations and recommending effective treatment have an important role in efforts to reduce the societal and economic effects of the disease.On the basis of the Rome IV criteria IBS is classified into four subtypes IBS with diarrhea IBS with constipation IBS with mixed symptoms of constipation and diarrhea or unsubtyped IBS according to patients' reports of the proportion of time they have hard or lumpy stools versus loose or watery stools.1 The rationale for these subtypes is to improve the homogeneity of patients recruited for clinical trials guide effective diagnosis and therapy and increase knowledge of potential pathophysiological mechanisms.National guidelines for IBS management state that in a patient who has symptoms meeting the Rome IV criteria with no alarm features Table 1 the physician should make a positive diagnosis of IBS without resorting to a battery of tests.6 However a survey suggests that community or primary care providers are more likely to request confirmatory tests and less likely to adopt a positive diagnostic strategy than are experts in the field.7 Nevertheless the yield of investigations performed to rule out organic disease in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IBS is low.Irritable Bowel SyndromeOrdering a panel of blood tests routinely is unsupported by the evidence although clinicians often request a complete blood count and C-reac- tive protein measurement to help rule out inflam- matory bowel disease.

In patients with these sub- types of IBS measurement of the fecal calpro- tectin level is useful because it can discriminate between IBS and inflammatory bowel disease with good accuracy i.e.

In a cross-sectional study involving 466 patients with the diarrheal or mixed subtype of IBS who underwent colonos- copy no cases of colorectal cancer were detect- ed and inflammatory bowel disease was observed in less than 2 of the patients.14 A meta-analysis showed that more than 1 in 4 persons with the diarrheal subtype of IBS has evidence of bile acid diarrhea on 23-seleno-25-homotaurocholic The information is from Mearin et al.1 GI denotes gastrointestinal.acid 75SeHCAT testing15 which involves admin- istration of 75Se-homocholyltaurine a bile acid radiolabeled with the gamma-emitting isotope selenium-75 with whole-body retention measured by means of gamma-camera scanning at 7 days.

Disordered bowel habits also need to be present.

A recent study examined the accuracy of two se- rum biomarkers antibodies to a bacterial toxin produced by Campylobacter jejuni and vinculin18 which distinguished IBS from inflammatory bowel disease with good specificity 92 for C. jejuni and 84 for vinculin but low sensitivity 44 for C. jejuni and 33 for vinculin.

A prospec- tive study involving 110 patients with IBS showed that the severity of IBS was associated with a distinct fecal microbiota signature characterized by reduced microbial diversity and a reduced prevalence of Methanobacteriales and prevotella.29 The mucosa-associated microbiome is not the same as the stool microbiome and cross-contam- ination during endoscopic biopsy may be a factor that accounts for the heterogeneous findings among individual studies.30 Gas production by bacteria may induce intestinal reflex responses through bowel distention that leads to inade- quate relaxation of the diaphragm pushing out the abdomen and causing visible abdominal dis-been documented33 although none are pathog- nomonic.
