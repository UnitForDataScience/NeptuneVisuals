d. The optimum temperature of GH1254 35 degC is substantially lower than cellulases from other termites including the endoglucanase from Nasutitermes takasagoensis 65 degC  the endoglucanase from Coptotermes formosanus 70 degC  and the b-glucosidase from Neotermes koshunensis 45 degC .Interestingly a cellulase from R. flavipes  which is homologous to GH1254 40 identical at the amino acid level also had a low optimum temperature 30 degC.

Relative activity is calculated as the percentage of the highest specific activity in each series which were 0.53 0.48 0.52 andUmg respectivelyTable 3 Substrate specificitiesSubstrateMUCpNPCpNPG3pNPLCMCAvicelr Sigmacellr celluloseof the C. curvignathus GH1254 Specific activity Umg0.510.042N.Da0.006N.Db N.DbN.DbN.D not detected within the concentration range of the standard chemical compounds used in the calibration curvesa The range of pNP concentrations used in the calibration curve was 0.03-0.21 lmolb The range of glucose concentrations used in the DNS calibration curve was 0.25-8.0 lmoltowards MUC 1.19 Umg was however higher than that of T. reesei CBHI 0.008 Umg towards pNP-lactoside .

The ability to degrade CMC is regar- ded as an indicator of endoglucanase activity  while activity towards Avicelr and Sigmacellr cellulose is used to detect cellobiohydrolase activity .

A similar feature was also reported in the cold-active salmon goose-type lysozyme where the recombinant enzyme showed no detectable activity at 60 degC however 30 activity was retained after heating the enzyme 3 h at 90 degC .

GH1254 showed highest activity at 35 degC and maintained 70 of its activity at 25 degC.

Full activity was retained after 30 min pre- incubation at 25 30 and 35 degC about 70 at 40 degC and 60 at 50 degC Fig.

The fermenter was operated in batch mode at 28 degC until the glycerol was depleted as indicated by a spike in dissolved oxygen concentration after 36 h. To further increase cell densities fed-batch conditions using a glycerol feed 50 vv glycerol 7.2 mL PTM1 per litre glycerol with a minimum feed rate of 0.125 mL min and a maximum feed rate of 0.25 mLmin for 11 h. A starvation period of 1 h was then imposed followed by methanol induction with the same feed rate 100 methanol  7.2 mL PTM1 per litre methanol at 25 degC for 40 h. The antifoaming agent J673A Struktol Schill  - Seilacher Struktol GmbH Hamburg Germany was used at 5 vv to control foaming.
