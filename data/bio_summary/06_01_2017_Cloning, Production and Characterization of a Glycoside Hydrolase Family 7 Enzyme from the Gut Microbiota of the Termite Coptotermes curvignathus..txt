a similar feature was also reported in the cold-active salmon goose-type lysozyme where the recombinant enzyme showed no detectable activity at 60 degc however 30 activity was retained after heating the enzyme 3 h at 90 degc .

those from macrotermes mul- leri displayed highest activity at ph 4.4 while a c. for- mosanus endoglucanase showed maximum activity at ph 5.8-6.0  .

gh1254 showed highest activity at 35 degc and maintained 70 of its activity at 25 degc.

gh1254 catalyzed optimally at 35 degc and maintained 70 of its activity at 25 degc.

fractions that contained high concentrations of proteins were pooled diluted twofold with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer ph 4 and concentrated using vivaspin centrifugal concentrators cut-off--10 kda--ge healthcare bio-sciences corp..enzyme assaysthe catalytic activity initial rates of gh1254 was mea- sured using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbellif- eryl-b-d-cellobioside muc sigma-aldrich corp. st. louis mo in a 400-ll reaction mixture containing 30 mm citrate buffer ph 4.0 0.5 mm muc and 3 lg of purified gh1254 incubated for 15-180 min at 15 min intervals.

subsequently enzyme assays were incubated at 35 degc for 20 min within the linear enzyme activity phase and the reactions terminated by adding 100 ll of 1.0 m na2co3.

to detect nitrophenol the hydrolysis product optical densities were read at 405 nm.enzyme activity of gh1254 was assayed against the insoluble microcrystalline substrate avicelr ph-101 sigma-aldrich and sigmacellr cellulose as well as the soluble substrate carboxymethyl cellulose cmc both at a final concentration of 1 wv using 3 lg of purified gh1254.

the effects of sds 0.1 and 1.0 wv on enzyme activity under standard condi- tions were also tested.results and discussioncellulases-encoding genes in the gut transcriptometranscriptomics data revealed 3254 carbohydrate-active enzyme cazy-related transcripts from the gut of c. curvignathus which consisted 69 transcripts encoding gh family 7 enzymes.
