The change in microbiota structure often starts in the early life in children with or at risk of chronic diseases such as cystic fibrosis The microbiome is established within the first 1 to 3 years of life and remains relatively stable throughout the life span The neonatal period is a critical window for immune programming that affects the global health status for a life- time and the development of the gut microbiota may help predicting specific disease risk and disease progression or elimination of disease altogether In this review we analyze the main factors and phases of early microbial imprinting gut-lung axis in the progression of chronic lung diseases in children and the manipulationof early-life gut microbiota for modifying history of lung diseases in children.Factors Influencing Gut Microbiota Composition in Early InfancyEnvironmental factors together with genetics and immune system activity influence microbial colonization pattern in newborns Table The concept that the fetus is sterile has been reconsidered after detection of microbial traces in fetal and maternal compartments It is now believed that there is a prenatal colonization with vertically transferred microbial material.The type of delivery influences the pattern of coloniza- tion in infant gut.

The relative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira Veillonella Faecalibacterium and Rothia seems significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma with consequent reducedTable 2 Gut microbiota alterations induced by antibiotic use.AntibioticsGut microbiota alterationsStudyReferencesCiprofloxacinDecrease of the taxonomic richness diversity and evenness of the communityHealthy adult humansAmoxicillin CefoperazoneAmpicillin Vancomycin Metronidazole NeomycinLong-lasting alterations in the gut microbial community including a decrease in overall diversityDecrease of microbial diversity and colonization with antibiotic-resistant microbesYoung miceYoung miceCeftriaxoneGut microbiota dysbiosisAdult micelevels of fecal acetate and dysregulation of enterohepatic metabolites Manipulation of Early-Life Gut Microbiota in Lung Diseases in ChildrenOral administration of probiotics and prebiotics or a combi- nation of both the so-called synbiotic approach could indirectly influence the composition of airway microbiota through the release of bacterial products or metabolites that reach the lung and promote the outgrowth of beneficial bac- teria or directly via microaspiration of the probiotic strain from the intestinal tract to the airways These mecha- nisms may restore a health-promoting microbiota and have a beneficial effect on the course of the disease.

Chronic gut inflam- mation is seen in CF even in the absence of overt gastrointes- tinal symptoms and is thought to be a driver of systemic inflammation a hallmark of the disease The association between gut microbial colonization in early life and respira- tory outcomes in patients with CF has been investigated and breastfeeding was associated with delayed exacerbations gut diversity and prolonged periods of well-being and spe- cific bacterial communities in the gut prior to respiratory complications Bacteria in the respiratory tract in CF originate from intestinal microbiota and are thought to con- tribute to the dynamic interactions between the host and microbial communities in CF Studies have demonstrated also a relationship between poor nutrition and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants who require prolonged supple- mental oxygen therapy No data are available regarding gut dysbiosis in this setting.Children developing asthma have a reduced gut micro- bial diversity in the first year of life as compared to healthy children In particular delivery mode has been associ- ated with wheezing and asthma until school age mediated by specific gut bacterial groups The presence of benefi- cial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium longum and a reduc- tion in Bacteroides fragilis in the gut have been associated with a lower incidence of asthma.

However data on early intestine microbial manipulation are missing because asthma develops progressively until school age and the long-term follow-up of probiotic and prebiotic study is limited.Manipulation of gut microbiota in CF by changing die- tary content of indigestible carbohydrate and short-chain fatty acids namely butyrate may improve undernutrition and play an anti-inflammatory effect on animals Resto- ration of gut microbiota by probiotics improves nutritional status energy intake and respiratory function in cystic fibro- sis Three RCT concluded that probiotic administration in particular LGG and Lactobacillus reuteri has been related with a reduction of episodes of pulmonary exacerbations in children with CF -The first evidence of the potential benefits of probiotic administration in CF came from a pro- spective randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial per- formed in two groups of patients with CF chronically colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The basic concept is to exploit this approach in critical window to achieve the best results in the control of future health.IntroductionClinical research in the last decades focused on host-microbe crosstalk especially at intestinal level raising the hypothesis that the gut microbiota is one of the key factors that deter- mine host health.

The immune and metabolic functions are influenced by the colonization of intestine by friendly bacte- ria and a growing number of diseases derive from the gut microbiota composition.

The latter dominate the microbiota of breastfed infants whereas formula-fed infants had higher proportions of Bacteroides and members of the Clostridium coccoides and Lactobacillus groups In addition breast- feeding modulates innate immune response Antibiotics have a major impact on gut microbiome com- position particularly in young infants.

The role of microbiota in lung homeostasis and immunity is supported by the poor outcomes of germ-free mice that were exposed to acute infections and their susceptibility to allergic air- way disease Dysbiosis in the gut has recently been linked to alterations in immune responses and to disease development in the lungs.
