Macpherson and colleagues re- ported that IgA restricts penetration of gut symbiotic bacteria to the mesenteric lymph nodes thereby limiting systemic dissemination of symbiotic bacteria and preserving host-microbe symbiosis.117118 Consistently a recent study demonstrated that intestinal bacteria with high IgA coating confer enhanced susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in GF mice suggesting that IgA specifically coats more inflammatory and hence colitogenic intestinal bacteria under homeostatic conditions to confine these harmful bacteria in the intestinal lumen.119 Togetherthese studies highlight an integral role for IgA in compartmentalizing intestinal bacteria especially those with heightened virulence in the intestinal lumen to maintain host-microbe symbiosis.

In mice most intestinal IgA is directed against gut symbi- otic bacteria and coating by SIgA in intestinal lumen prevents invading bacteria from crossing the gut epithelium.116 Studies of mice deficient in pIgR showed impaired export of SIgA and SIgM into the intestinal lumen elevated serum IgG and more importantly increased mucosal penetration of symbiotic bacteria and enhanced systemic antibodies against these translocated bacteria.

Furthermore intestinal inflammation was not observed in germ-free TCR-deficient mice col- onized with a defined commensal community.201 These observations strongly suggest that intestinal inflammation might be initiated by spe- cific microbes normally present in the gut flora that have yet to be identified.In addition HLA-B27-transgenic rats interleukin IL-10- and IL- 2-deficient mice raised under conventional conditions spontaneously developed chronic colitis but the germ-free condition prevented the development of intestinal pathology.202-204Additional evidence arguing for a pathogenic role of the gut mi- crobiota in IBD derived from an UC-like colitis model that sponta- neously occurred in TRUC mice and that was cured by broad-spectrum antibiotics.205 The role of microbiota in driving intestinal inflammation has also been confirmed in a model of chronic CD-like ileitis sponta- neously developed in SPF but not germ-free mice carrying a dele- tion in the tumor necrosis factor AU-rich elements.206 Taken together these observations suggest that the luminal microbes provide the stimulus for host immune responses that ultimately lead to mucosal damage in genetically susceptible hosts.The intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells are constantly in contact with foreign material including dietary and microbial factors.

Intestinal eosinophilsEosinophils constitute a major population of leukocytes in the gastro- intestinal tract under homeostatic conditions independently of the gut microbiota.7576 Although eosinophils are most known as proinflamma- tory cells that contribute to the pathogenesis of various allergic dis- eases more recent studies reveal remarkable functional diversity of eosinophils in different tissues.77 For example unlike eosinophils from the lung or blood small intestinal eosinophils display extended lifes- pans.7576 Sugawara et al.76 recently reported that small intestinal eo- sinophils constitutively secrete high levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1Ra a natural inhibitor of IL-1b which is promoted by production of GM-CSF by intestinal epithelial cells in a gut microbiota-independent manner.

Our studies also revealed that constitutive expression of pro-IL-1-b requires the gut microbiota in a Myd88-dependent manner.8283 In ad- dition in response to intestinal injury our more recent study showed that gut symbiotic Enterobacteriaceae and in particular Proteus mira- bilis induce robust NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1b production in newly recruited Ly6Chi monocytes which promotes inflammation in the intestine.84 Taken together our studies and others' suggest a complex role for the gut microbiota in controlling recruitment of cir- culating monocytes to replenish resident intestinal macrophages and functional changes of intestinal macrophages in response to injury or infection.4  REGULATION OF T- CELL RESPONSE BY THE GUT MICROBIOTAA myriad of intestinal immune defects are observed in GF animals including impaired development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues GALTs gut-associated Th17 cells and Tregs lower numbers of IgA- producing B cells and intraepithelial CD8 T cells Figure 2.

Human RORgt ILCs were shown to express functional TLR2 which can be stimulated to induce IL-2 that enhances IL-22 production in an autocrine manner.102 The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR which can be activated by ligands generated from tryptophan metabolism by gut symbiotic bacteria is expressed on RORgt ILCs and critical for ILC development IL-22 production maturation of GALTs and enteric immunity against Citrobacter rodentium.99-101 In addition IL-1b and IL-23 produced by intestinal phagocytes can promote IL-22 produc- tion RORgt ILCs.103 We have previously shown that gut symbiotic bacteria promote the expression of IL-1b in intestinal macrophages under steady-state conditions that likely contribute to the emergence of RORgt ILCs.83Furthermore the role of RORgt ILCs in regulating the gut micro- biota has been unraveled in recent studies.

However redundant measures are in place to ensure compartmen- talization of symbiotic bacteria in the intestine including sIgA patrol- ling intestinal phagocytes mucous layer the epithelium and lastly the MLNs as a firewall where escaped intestinal bacteria would be killed by phagocytes.

For years there was the dogma of systemic ig- norance rather than tolerance toward intestinal symbiotic bacteria due to complete compartmentalization of intestinal symbiotic bacteria in the intestine.

Of note MUC2-deficient mice showed enhanced bacterial adhesion to the surface epithelium increased intestinal per- meability and increased susceptibility to develop spontaneous or DSS- induced colitis and colorectal cancer.55174175A recent paper underlined the contribution of mucin-derived sialic acid in promoting the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae during intestinal inflammation induced in mice by DSS treatment.176 Sialic acid one of the major carbohydrates in mucin can be taken up by bacteria which are unable to de novo synthesize these sugars such as E. coli and then incorporated into bacterial capsule and lipooligosaccharides.177In addition S. typhimurium and C. difficile used a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal sugars such as fucose and sialic acid during their expansion within the gut.45 Overall these observations suggest that sialic acid catabolism may confer a growth advantage to Enterobacteriaceae in the inflamed gut.Enterobacteriaceae can also overcome other bacteria by producing antimicrobial molecules promoting their blooms in the gut.

This dogma was supported by a study showing un- detectable serum IgG from naive mice against Enterobacter cloacea a Gram-positive gut symbiotic bacterium.125 However higher titers of serum IgG against fecal symbiotic bacteria were frequently reported in patients with either Crohn's disease or Colitis which was thought to reflect either prior infections or systemic translocation of gut bacteria in these patients due to leaky epithelial barrier.126 In addition we recently reported that gut symbiotic bacteria promote the adjuvant activity of cholera toxin an enterotoxin secreted by Vibrio cholera that has been used as a potent mucosal adjuvant through Nod2-mediated recognition of its microbial agonist by dendritic cells.127Evidence from a few recent studies has emerged that the systemic immune system in humans and mice is not ignorant toward gut sym- biotic bacteria under homeostatic conditions.
