intestinal eosinophilseosinophils constitute a major population of leukocytes in the gastro- intestinal tract under homeostatic conditions independently of the gut microbiota.7576 although eosinophils are most known as proinflamma- tory cells that contribute to the pathogenesis of various allergic dis- eases more recent studies reveal remarkable functional diversity of eosinophils in different tissues.77 for example unlike eosinophils from the lung or blood small intestinal eosinophils display extended lifes- pans.7576 sugawara et al.76 recently reported that small intestinal eo- sinophils constitutively secrete high levels of il-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra a natural inhibitor of il-1b which is promoted by production of gm-csf by intestinal epithelial cells in a gut microbiota-independent manner.

macpherson and colleagues re- ported that iga restricts penetration of gut symbiotic bacteria to the mesenteric lymph nodes thereby limiting systemic dissemination of symbiotic bacteria and preserving host-microbe symbiosis.117118 consistently a recent study demonstrated that intestinal bacteria with high iga coating confer enhanced susceptibility to dss-induced colitis in gf mice suggesting that iga specifically coats more inflammatory and hence colitogenic intestinal bacteria under homeostatic conditions to confine these harmful bacteria in the intestinal lumen.119 togetherthese studies highlight an integral role for iga in compartmentalizing intestinal bacteria especially those with heightened virulence in the intestinal lumen to maintain host-microbe symbiosis.

furthermore intestinal inflammation was not observed in germ-free tcr-deficient mice col- onized with a defined commensal community.201 these observations strongly suggest that intestinal inflammation might be initiated by spe- cific microbes normally present in the gut flora that have yet to be identified.in addition hla-b27-transgenic rats interleukin il-10- and il- 2-deficient mice raised under conventional conditions spontaneously developed chronic colitis but the germ-free condition prevented the development of intestinal pathology.202-204additional evidence arguing for a pathogenic role of the gut mi- crobiota in ibd derived from an uc-like colitis model that sponta- neously occurred in truc mice and that was cured by broad-spectrum antibiotics.205 the role of microbiota in driving intestinal inflammation has also been confirmed in a model of chronic cd-like ileitis sponta- neously developed in spf but not germ-free mice carrying a dele- tion in the tumor necrosis factor au-rich elements.206 taken together these observations suggest that the luminal microbes provide the stimulus for host immune responses that ultimately lead to mucosal damage in genetically susceptible hosts.the intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells are constantly in contact with foreign material including dietary and microbial factors.

intestinal macrophagesthere are resident macrophages in every tissue of the body where they contribute to the maintenance of tissue by acting as the first line of defense against pathogens and by initiating wound repair.78 a recent study demonstrated that yolk sac and fetal liver-derived macrophages are present in the neonatal intestine which however are diluted by ly6chi monocyte-derived macrophages that infiltrate into the intestine around the time of weaning in a process that is dependent on ccr2 expression of the monocytes and neonatal gut microbiota.79 consistently although gf mice exhibit a normal intes- tinal macrophage compartment at birth recruitment of ly6chi mono- cytes into the intestine is markedly diminished at 3 weeks of age.79 intestinal macrophages are hyporesponsive to bacterial toll-like re- ceptor ligands such as lipopolysaccharides which is critical to prevent inappropriate activation of inflammatory responses in the intes- tine.8081 consistently we have previously demonstrated that a lack of a functional nlrp3 inflammasome in intestinal resident macrophages which would minimize inappropriate production of il-1b and induction of inflammation under steady-state conditions.82 on the other hand intestinal macrophages constitutively express nlrc4 and pro-il-1-b which allows precipitous release of il- b and initiation of inflammatory response upon infection with enteric pathogens such as salmonella.

our studies also revealed that constitutive expression of pro-il-1-b requires the gut microbiota in a myd88-dependent manner.8283 in ad- dition in response to intestinal injury our more recent study showed that gut symbiotic enterobacteriaceae and in particular proteus mira- bilis induce robust nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated il-1b production in newly recruited ly6chi monocytes which promotes inflammation in the intestine.84 taken together our studies and others' suggest a complex role for the gut microbiota in controlling recruitment of cir- culating monocytes to replenish resident intestinal macrophages and functional changes of intestinal macrophages in response to injury or infection.4  regulation of t- cell response by the gut microbiotaa myriad of intestinal immune defects are observed in gf animals including impaired development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues galts gut-associated th17 cells and tregs lower numbers of iga- producing b cells and intraepithelial cd8 t cells figure 2.  th17 cellsgf mice have reduced numbers of th1 and th17 cells.

in mice most intestinal iga is directed against gut symbi- otic bacteria and coating by siga in intestinal lumen prevents invading bacteria from crossing the gut epithelium.116 studies of mice deficient in pigr showed impaired export of siga and sigm into the intestinal lumen elevated serum igg and more importantly increased mucosal penetration of symbiotic bacteria and enhanced systemic antibodies against these translocated bacteria.

coli and the pathogen c. rodentium both members of the family of enterobacteriaceae due to disrupted intestinal homeostasis that results in an increased inflammatory tone of the intestinal mucosa in mice.147148 similarly evidence showed that a previous antibiotic use maybe related to the development of diarrhea-predominant irritablebowel syndrome149150 a clinical condition in humans characterized by increased abundance of enterobacteriaceae pasteurellaceae and pseudedomonadaceae families all members of the phylum of proteobacteria.151-154furthermore several reports confirmed a consistent increase in the relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae in the stools of infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis a fatal disease that is a major cause of mortality in preterm infants.155intestinal inflammation induced by the administration of en- teric pathogens or by parasite infection has been associated with disruption of the intestinal ecosystem that leads to an uncontrolled enterobacteriaceae expansion within the microbial community inhab- iting the distal gut.156-158 notably it has been shown that pathogens belonging to the family of enterobacteriaceae namely c. rodentium ands.

in addi- tion supplementation of spf microbiota with e. coli isolated from a patient with celiac disease increased the severity of gluten-induced pathology.161 finally e. coli and shigella isolated from patients with celiac disease have been shown to increase intestinal permeability in this intestinal disorder likely due to reduced expression of tight junction proteins.162 overall accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation-inflicted blooms of enterobacteriaceae are associated with various intestinal diseases and could further exacerbate the in- testinal inflammation.

alike sfb that typ- ically adhere tightly to intestinal epithelium without invading the epi- thelial cells other mucus inhabitants such as akkermansia species and mucispirillum genus have been reported to accumulate in the intestine of mice experiencing dss-induced recurring colitis.213 thus it is con- ceivable that mucus-dwelling commensals due to their proximity to the intestinal epithelium can trigger abnormal host immune responses leading to chronic inflammation and ultimately to mucosal damage in ibd figure 3.the crucial role of intestinal microbes in the pathogenesis of ibd has been further strengthened by the identification of several ibd- susceptibility genes many involved in mediating host responses to gut microbes.

dampening gut inflammation utilizing resistant competitors probiotics or maneuvering nutritional changes such as prebiotics and metals might be potential approaches to re- stricting blooms of enterobacterieaceae or disease-causing bacteria in the future.acknowledgementsthis work was supported by nih grants t32hl007517 and 5p30dk034933 to m. y. z. t32dk094775 to j. m. p and dk091191 and dk095782 to g. n..conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.references marcobal a barboza m froehlich jw et al.
