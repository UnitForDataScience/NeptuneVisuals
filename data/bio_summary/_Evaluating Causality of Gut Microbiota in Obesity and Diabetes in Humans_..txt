we will discuss in the next paragraphs available evidence that implicate a role for the gut microbiota in development of metabolic dis- eases such as obesity and diabetes in humans.136meijnikman et algut microbiota and human metabolic diseaseendocrine reviews april 2018 392133-153 reviewgut microbiome composition and t2dm development in humans why it is challenging to determine causality in humansinterest in the role of the gut microbiota in development of metabolic disturbances such as obesity and tdm in humans has risen substantially over the past decade.

the ability to genetically modify mice provides valuable mechanistic insight in how the gut microbiota affects host metabolism and augments metabolic disease development.studies in gf mice which lack microbiota pro- vided first important evidence that the gut microbiota potentially plays a causal role in development of obesity and -related diseases.

it can therefore be speculated that despite increased scfa production the gut microbiota of obese subjects has reduced capacity to handle scfa.140meijnikman et algut microbiota and human metabolic diseaseendocrine reviews april 2018 392133-153 reviewin contrast to obese subjects without diabetes fecal microbiota from obese patients with tdm has been shown to be relatively depleted in scfa-producing bacterial species  .

furthermore we will discuss means to modify gut microbiome composition in humans to help establish causality and discuss systems biology approaches that might hold the key to unravel the role of gut microbiota in obesity and diabetes.factors shaping the gut microbiotathe human gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem consisting of an estimated bacteria .

the proximal gi tract is enriched in bacteria belonging to the phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria and the genus lactobacilli whereas the distal gi tract mainly comprises bacteria belonging to the phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes and the akkermansia muciniphila species .134meijnikman et algut microbiota and human metabolic diseaseendocrine reviews april 2018 392133-153 reviewalthough a definition of what a healthy gut micro- biome comprises still has to be defined it is clear that in healthy individuals the composition of the intestinal microbiota is highly diverse .

children born through caesarean section on the other hand have a gut microbiota composition that resembles the skin microbiota composition of the mother's .

in addition to interindividual changes in microbiota composition functional analysis of the gut microbiota of children and adults indicated age-related differences in the abundance of genes in- volved in amino acid metabolism lipopolysaccharide lps biosynthesis rna degradation and steroid hormone biosynthesis .

thus when assessing microbiota composition in tdm subjects it is of critical importance to correct for metformin use.proton pump inhibitors are frequently used oralantiacid medication that have also been implicated to modulate gut microbiota composition .

often times it cannot be con- cluded if gut microbiota composition was affected prior to disease development causal or whether the microbiota composition is a reflection consequence of the disease itself.

a follow-up study in which fecal microbiota was transplanted from conventionally raised obese mice to gf mice further accelerated establishment of a causal role for the gut microbiota in development of obesity .

in support of this hypothesis microbiota of murine rygb donors augmented weight gain in gf recipients compared with gf mice that had received microbiota from sham-operated donors .

although mechanistic evidence for a causal role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of these diseases in humans is scarce currently available data suggest that an altered microbiota composition affects gut barrier function and induces low-grade inflammatory events either locally in the intestine or systemically.

in humans with tdm oligofructose proved to be a useful prebiotic supplementation for months increased weight loss and improved glucose control compared with patients receiving placebo .despite focus of food industry on development of novel prebiotics and probiotics to modulate microbiota composition andor functional output to subse- quently improve host metabolism thus far only minimal beneficial effects of gut microbiota modulation on metabolism have been obtained.

in line based on baseline microbiota composition of the recipient the metabolic response to fmt could be predicted.variation in experimental protocols preparation of fecal samples and diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota  are additional explanations for variable efficacy of fmt.

furthermore these studies do not provide mechanistic insight into the interplay be- tween the gut microbiota and host metabolism.prospective and intervention studies in large human cohorts combined with dedicated mechanistic studies in model systems are required to under- stand if and how gut microbiota affects meta- bolic disease development.
