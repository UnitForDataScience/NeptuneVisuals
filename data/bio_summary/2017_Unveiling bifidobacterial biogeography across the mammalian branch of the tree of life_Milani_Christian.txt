In fact isolates obtained from mother and the respective child and corresponding milk sample displayed an average nucleotide iden- tity value 499.99 as well as 100 ITS identity Supplementary Text.Altogether the data obtained by dissection of the genome of these two isolates Supplementary Table S8 and growth experiments on human milk oligo- saccharide HMO and HMO-derived sugars Supplementary Figure S7 indicated that these vertically transmitted strains have evolved to use carbon sources typically present in milk thus point- ing at mammary glands as an effective reservoir and milk as an optimal vector for vertical transmission of seemingly specifically adapted bifidobacterial mem- bers of the gut microbiota from mother to offspring.ConclusionsBifidobacteria represent a prototype for the investi- gation of the ecological and functional roles exertedby the mammalian gut microbiota especially during the crucial developmental phase immediately fol- lowing birth when gut colonization takes place.Nevertheless current ecological knowledge on bifidobacteria is essentially restricted to the human gut and in particular the period during which the infant's nutrition is exclusively milk In the current study we explored the bifidobacterial ecology in 67 mamma- lian species representing an exhaustive array of species within this class of animals by means of bifidobacterial ITS profiling.

In fact evaluation of the average relative abundance of these 89 putative novel bifidobacterial taxa calculated including only data of the mammalian species where they are detected revealed that only newtaxa74 and newtaxa20 were shown to elicit an average relative abundance 48 17.9 and 12.4 respec-tively 2.These findings indicate that these suspected and as yet undescribed novel members of the genus Bifidobacterium are widespread among mammals though their presence has until now remained undetected probably owing to their low abundance 2.To validate the in silico identification of novel taxa we isolated and genomically characterized two of these novel bifidobacterial species by means of a previously described cultivation-based approach  Supplementary Table S5 Supplementary Text.Co-variance of bifidobacterial species among mammals Availability of profiling data for all known and putative novel bifidobacterial species allowed the evaluation of their co-occurrence or co-exclusion across the mammalian tree of life by means of Pearson correlation index Supplementary Table S6.

We have recently developed an internal transcribed spacer ITS-based metagenomic tool for bifidobacterial community profiling   allowing i accurate taxon identification down to phylotype level ii tracking vertical trans- mission events and iii discovery of putative novel bifidobacterial species .Here we describe the composition of the bifido- bacterial DNA present in fecal samples of a widespectrum of mammalian species and provide clues as to how these gut commensals establish themselves in the newborn gut through a vertical transmission route involving maternal milk as both a vehicle and a biological reservoir of early colonizing bacteria.Materials and methodsSample collectionHuman fecal samples were collected at the Parma University Hospital Parma Italy while stool of other mammals was retrieved at several Italian zoological parks.

The vertical heat map on the right-hand side shows data regarding the relative abundance of OTUs not classified as new bifidobacterial species but displaying similarity with other members of the Bifidobacteriaceae family while in the lower part of the image two horizontal heat maps present the average abundance with respect to the total bifidobacterial population of the profiled putative bifidobacterial species and their prevalence in the 291 mammalian samples.bifidobacterial species Supplementary Table S2.

The node size is proportional to the number of co-variances while the node color indicates the eight clusters observed.Cercopithecidae and Hominidae as well as mamma- lian families encompassing domesticated species harbor the highest number of novel bifidobacterial species 2.Moreover while six novel taxa newtaxa4 10 13 26 34 and 50 were shown to be prevalent at an average of 63.9 of the mammalian species ranging from 53.7 to 82.1 none of these exhibit a relative abundance 44.7 with respect to the overall bifidobacterial population.

The apparent widespread distribution of DNA corresponding to bifidobacterial species in different mammalian hosts may be a common characteristic of other members of the gut micro- biota as has been suggested by previous genus-level overviews performed by 16S rRNA-based profiling of feces collected from animals kept in captivity  .Furthermore feces collected from members of the mammalian families Cercopithecidae Hominidae Bovidae Suidae Equidae and Canidae were shown to carry DNA of a relatively high number of bifidobacterial species harboring on average at least 29 of the 45 currently known members of the genus Bifidobacterium 1.

This data suggests extensive mother-child transmis- sion of gut bifidobacterial phylotypes among mam- malian representatives and underlines the key role exerted by vertical transmission in defining the biodiversity and composition of the bifidobacterial population and perhaps other microbiota compo- nents colonizing the newborn gut.Furthermore the most represented bifidobacterial taxa in the shared OTUs pool of each mother- offspring pair were observed to represent on average the 81.7 and 92.3 of the total bifido- bacterial population in the respective mother and offspring samples Fi4.10090807060504030201001009080706050403020100 of the most vertically transmitted species in each mother-infant pair that is constituted by shared OTUs of the most vertically transmitted species in each mother-infant pair that is constituted by the three most abundant shared OTUs in the motherFigure 4 Impact of vertical transmission events on the offspring microbiota.

On the right-hand side of the image a heat map shows data regarding the relative abundance of putative novel bifidobacterial species with respect to the total bifidobacterial population while in the lower part two heat maps present the average abundance of the profiled bifidobacterial species with regards to the total bifidobacterial population and their prevalence in the 291 mammalian samples.

In contrast 15 bifidobacterial species despite showing a very limited distribution with a prevalence in mammalian species o10 were nonetheless found to be present in an average of 3 mammalian orders and 4 mammalian families 1.
