Although meat undoubtedly possesses all these benefits we need to cautiously consider information provided in recent studies which show that high consumption of red meat is associated with atherosclerosis cancer diabetes and the pro- gression of kidney failure .The quest for red meat in CKD patients The other side of the coinBecause high protein intake can accelerate the progression of CKD  the current recommendation for daily dietary protein intake is 0.6 to 0.8 gkg for nondialysis CKD patients conserva- tive treatment and 1.2 gkg for those on dialysis .

Taken together increased intake of red meat could be an important CVD risk factor for patients with CKD.Researchers have shown that red meat intake may increase the risk for CVD as well as metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes diverticulitis and cancer leading to a negative perception of the role of high intake of red meat for health .

Because high intake of red meat increases ferritin plasma levels which have been linked to oxidative stress markers  this increase may indirectly link red meat with increased oxidative stress.Gut dysbiosis links red meat to kidney disease progressionA prominent feature of the uremic phenotype is gut micro- biome dysbiosis which is characterized by the growth of bac- terial species that increase the production of uremic toxins .

Furthermore we present data from a pilot study in which we tested the hypothesis that a low-protein diet LPD prescribed for nondialysis CKD patients would reduce the amount of uremic toxins produced by gut microbiota.What is red meatFirst it is important to define red meat.

It should be emphasized that increased red meat production may significantly negatively affect green- house gas emission and global warming .The quest for red meat in CKD patients One side of the coinRed meat is characterized by high nutritional value because of its high nutrient content and bioavailability.

Taken together intake of red meat is associated with increased risk for CKD in a dose- dependent manner moreover intake of poultry fish eggs orTable 2Nutritional compositioncontent of red meats per 100 gFe iron Na sodium P phosphorus K potassium Mg magnesium Se selenium Zn zinc.

Awaiting the outcome of further studies we suggest that the red meat intake should be limited in patients with CKD and that the major part of the daily protein requirements should be obtained from sources other than red meat such as legumes nuts dairy products poultry and fish.Referencese ..fi .fi.. ..fi..aia fi ....fi .. .

The authors observed that red meat intake was associated with increased CKD risk whereas other protein sources such as nuts legumes and low-fat dairy products were associated with a lower risk for CKD .

felids such as cats and tigers are at high risk for CKD .CVD is the leading cause of death in patients with CKD thus it is important that high consumption of red and processed meat also relates to a significantly increased risk for heart disease .

However a prescription of 1.2 g proteinkg daily patients on dialysis is able to increase the phosphate levels.Proinflammatory and prooxidative effects of red meatOxidative stress and chronic inflammation are common fea- tures in CKD and are considered major mediators of disease progression and CV mortality in CKD .
