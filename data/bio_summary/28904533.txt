also demonstrated increased ileal crypt proliferation in ex-germfree mice inresponse to colonization with microbiota from healthy infants relative to colonization with microbiota from infants with low weight gain In studies in which GF rodents were exposed to commensal microbes increased colonic epithelial proliferation and deepened large bowel crypts were observed Although this effect was reported in other small intestinal regions as well it was evident that the magni- tude of the effect of microbes on epithelial morphology is region-specific Duodenal and jejunal intestinal epi- thelia from CR mice display slightly increased proliferation relative to ileum despite the fact that duodenal and jejunal luminal bacterial loads are substantially less than what is found in the ileal lumen The potential primacy of microbial composition over total bacterial number on the control of intestinal epithelial proliferation was demon- strated by the observation that exposure to specific bacterial species such as the breast milk-derived probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 induces intestinal epithelial proliferation while other strains like L. reuteri PTA 6475 do not Viruses may also contribute to overall intestinal epithelial morphology and physiology.

The position of the IESC within the crypt is a major determining factor of its self-renewal capacity driven in part by Wnt and Delta- Notch signaling Transcription factors such as Klf5 Gata4 Gata6 Ascl2 and Yy1 have been shown to control intestinal stem cell fate and their deficiency causes disrup- tion of intestinal architecture More recently micro- RNAs too have emerged as key regulators of the niche and responders to environmental stimuli in IESCs For example miR-375 in murine IESCs is highly sensitive to the presence of microbes and loss-of-function studies in ex vivo mouse enteroid cultures suggest that it may be a prominent regulator of intestinal epithelial proliferation For further detailed review of IESCs we refer the reader to recent review article Paneth Cells.

Comprehen- sive characterization of the functional diversity of mesenchy- mal cells and their roles in the niche remains an active and important area of research.Macrophages are crucial sentinels in the healthy intesti- nal lamina propria that are required for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis in the face of microbiota and food antigens Epithelial tuft cells and goblet cells mediate immune response to microbes and microbial-derived pep- tides by secreting chemokines to which these intestinal macrophages readily respond -In both rodents and humans intestinal macrophages are more numerous in the small intestine than in the large bowel.

The intes- tinal stem cell niche has been described as being maintained under completely sterile conditions in the absence of injury -However microbes residing within intestinal mucosa and indeed within healthy intestinal crypts are welldocumented which raises the possibility of direct regulation of intestinal stem cell physiology by gut microbiota.

There is growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in modulating intestinal proliferation and differentiation as well as other aspects of intestinal physiology.

The mechanisms by which luminal microbes could affect such changes in intestinal architecture may involve TLR activation extracellular vesicles EVs metabolic byproducts andor other heretofore unspecified direct and indirect on intestinal epithelial stem cells.IEC populations also see reviews Recent single-cell transcriptomic work has shown that there is heterogeneity even among Lgr5 actively cycling IESCs This molecu- lar heterogeneity was also seen in earlier studies comparing populations of CD24lo and side-population IESCs as well as in a very recent RNA-seq-based comparison of IESC populations isolated by diverse methods The chromatin state and many transcription factors and signaling cascades regulate IESC stemness.

EECs are also abundant in the rectum where they are found at the highest frequency in the GI tract other than the proximal small bowel-It has been suggested that crypt EECs or possiblysecretory progenitor cells in general may comprise a reserve pool of IESCs that actively proliferate in response to intestinal injury Their contributions to the maintenance of IESC function remain poorly characterized however it is known that certain EEC-secreted peptides such as Glp-2 can serve as paracrine signaling molecules to promote intestinal epithelial proliferation EECs have also been shown to respond to microbe-derived peptides and therefore may act as a conduit signaling mechanism for the IESC niche For example recently it was shown that colonic exposure to proteins from Escherichia coli stimulate Pyy and Glp-1 release from EECs in rats Much more work remains to be done in order to define more rigorously the functional importance of crypt EECs to the IESC niche.Stromal Cells.

Constituents of the intestinal microbiota and their products are potentially highly potent regulators of IESC activity due to their proxim- ity to the intestinal epithelia as well as their profound effects on host nutrition metabolism and mucosal barrier integrity.Region-Specific Roles for Gut Microbiota in the Control of Intestinal Epithelial Renewal.

More recently researchers have moved to the use of ex vivo three-dimensional 3D primary enteroid and intestinal organoid models to evaluate epithelial-microbe interactions - Intestinal tissue is isolatedTable 1Coculture typeDescriptionProsConsReferenceMonolayer3D-scaffoldAn intestinal cell line or ex vivo enteroids is grown in monolayers on standard cell culture plate or transwell.
