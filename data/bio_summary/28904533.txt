in what follows we will provide an overview of the major cell types in the iesc niche and then a more detailed description of the known contributions of resident microbiota.the cell types of the intestinal epithelial stem cell nicheintestinal epithelial stem cells.

those cell types that are known or suspected to comprise the intestinal stem cell niche include the adjoining paneth cells of the small bowel or the deep crypt secretory cells of the colon as well as myofibroblasts dendritic cells macrophages muscle cells and enteric glia and neurons found in the subepithelial lamina propria and submucosal compartments of both small and large intestine.host cells the microbiota influence niche functions and thereby modulate iesc behavior differently across the length of the intestine as such it is important to consider regional differences in microbial composition that may con- tribute to different functions when studying the iesc niche.

for example we recently dem- onstrated that genes in pathways associated with mitotic cell cycle are transcriptionally upregulated in jejunal cell popula- tions enriched for stem cells of conventionalized animals relative to gf animals yu et al.

the intes- tinal stem cell niche has been described as being maintained under completely sterile conditions in the absence of injury -however microbes residing within intestinal mucosa and indeed within healthy intestinal crypts are welldocumented which raises the possibility of direct regulation of intestinal stem cell physiology by gut microbiota.

tuft cells have recently been shown to respond in part to parasites and helminthes by secreting il-25 il-25 induces innate lymphoid cells to secrete the iesc stimulat- ing factor il-13 resulting in increased goblet and tuft cell differentiation il-33 expression in intestinal stro- mal cells provides another possible mechanism by which microbes may regulate iescs as some microbes including helminths and other parasites induce il-33 release from lymphocytes for example it was recently shown that tnf-a- and il-1b-stimulated il-33 release from pericryptal fibroblasts in response to salmonella typhimurium infectionpromotes secretory cell differentiation of iescs sources of il-33 are not limited to these fibroblasts epi- thelial cells may also express il-33 thereby further regulating iesc differentiation.finally microbiota-derived neurostimulatory peptides including glutamate serotonin and gaba as well as macro- nutrients like glucose and fatty acids can act as neurotrans- mitters to stimulate the enteric nervous system which in turn can regulate iesc function see reviews mazzoli and pessione and neunlist and schemann .tools to study microbiota interactions in the iesc nichea number of questions remain with regard to how the micro- biota may influence the iesc niche.

moreover there exist no known cell lines for certain intestinal cell types such as paneth cells ex vivo models to study intestinal host-microbe interaction.

more recently researchers have moved to the use of ex vivo three-dimensional 3d primary enteroid and intestinal organoid models to evaluate epithelial-microbe interactions - intestinal tissue is isolatedtable 1coculture typedescriptionprosconsreferencemonolayer3d-scaffoldan intestinal cell line or ex vivo enteroids is grown in monolayers on standard cell culture plate or transwell.

enteroids and organoids will grow into large 3d masses containing all mature cell types of the isolated tissue which more accurately mimics in vivo physiology compared to in vitro models enteroids refers to cultures consisting solely of intestinal epithelial tissue whereas organoids are derived to contain multiple tissue types such as epithelia enteric nerves myofi- broblasts and smooth muscle cells enteroid cultures can be passaged indefinitely making them a viable alternative to immortalized cell lines.

nevertheless we recently demonstrated that iescs grown in enteroid culture can be genetically manipulated using gymnosis to knockdown gene and microrna expression recently monolayer versions of ex vivo enteroid culture systems have emerged which expand the number of assays that can be performed including patch clamps and live imaging studies less widely used are ex vivo mucosal explants and slice models which like organoids contain a full complement of intestinal cell types and like coculture systems can be manipulated by adding microbes to the culture media see review however even with high oxygenation small bowel explants have not been cultured successfully beyond 48 hours and are not easily multiplexed like some enteroid systems which severely limits their usefulness despite the advantages of using these culture systems results of experiments intended to evaluate the effects on iescs could be confounded by the presence of mature differentiated intestinal cell types.

as an alternative to lcm methods we derived gf sox9-egfp reporter mice which allow for the isolation of iescs and progenitor cells using fluorescent- activated cell sorting facs allowing for more precise assaying of cell-type-specific effects of microbiota depletion of bacteria in cr animals using broad spectrum antibiotics is another approach for investigating the effect of microbiota on the stem cell niche.
