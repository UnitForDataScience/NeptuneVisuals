Recent researchhas emerged that suggests potential therapeutic approaches to modulateand stabilize the gut microbiota and to restore its healthy composition from dysbiotic states in various conditions such as mood disorders.1There is a bidirectional signaling that exists between the metabolically complex intestinal microbiota the gut and the brain.23 This system of communication integrates immunological neural and hormonal signals between the brain-gut-microbiota axis.4It is becoming apparent that the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tractand the brain plays a critical role in maintaining brainhealth and the stress response.

In addition the presence of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus bacteria types helps instruct the immune system to distinguish between proinflammatory andanti-inflammatory intestinal bacteria thereby creating appropriate immune response by identifying antigenic organisms.14The expanded definition of psychobiotics includes prebiotics which are nondigestible fibers that are metabolized by the intestinal tract and promote the proliferation serve of beneficial gut bacteria.

Prebiotics oligofructose have been shown to enhance homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract by reducing intestinal permeability preventingand treating gastrointestinal disorders involving the loss of barrier function.Psychophysiological effectsThe psychophysiological effects of psychobiotics include systemic effects on the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal HPA axis psychological effects on emotional and cognitive processes the glucocorticoid stress response and inflammation that is characterized by atypical cytokine concentrations.15 Proinflammatory cytokine is known to have a strong association with conditions such as depression.1617Preclinical evaluation1Various research strategies have been used to elucidate the role of psychobiotics on stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression including the use of germ-free animal models.5 Research models using GF mice have demonstrated that the absence of commensal microbiota which results in an underdeveloped immune system can affect behavioral functions and central nervous system neurotransmission.18In animal studies focusing on maternal separation a well-established model of an early-life stressor it is apparent that neonatal stress results in profound and long-lasting changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and also results in behavioral alterations associated with changes of the HPAaxis.1920 Maternal separation is associated with an increase in corticosterone content in the hypothalamus and also an increased release of corticosterone in response to stress later in adult life.21 Given this it has been found that concurrent treatment with Lactobacillus spp during the early stress phase will normalize basal corticosterone levels reducing stress and associated anxiety.20The use of psychobiotics in animal studies has consistently shown an impact on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors which are now being validated through clinical research.Clinical evaluationIt is well established that there is a direct link between stress mood disorders and gastrointestinal dysfunction.22 Although the organism is normally capable of adapting to various kinds of stressors a chronic overload of protracted stress can adversely affect both the mind and the body.

The commensal microbiota functions to maintain homeostasis of the central nervous system by signaling to the brain through various mechanisms that include immune mediators such as cytokines the vagus nerve microbial metabolites and neurometabolites such as short-chain fatty acids vitamins and neurotransmitters which ultimately influence neurotransmission mood and behavior.Although it is well recognized that intestinal pathogens have the ability to influence mental function there is emerging evidence that specific intestinal microbiota provides beneficial effects on mental health.

Fur- thermore preclinical studies indicate that the microbiome is fundamental to normal neurodevelopment mood and behavior.56 This realization of- fers potential for targeting disequilib- rium that may exist in the microbiota- gut-brain axis and developing spe- cific psychobiotics for the treatmentof mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.7MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXISIt is increasingly recognized that the microbiota- gut-brain axis has an intrinsic role in stress-related mental disorders.6 The human gut is colonizedby 10 trillion to 100 trillion microbes which encapsulate more than 3.3 million nonhuman genes approximately 150 times more genetic material than the genome itself.8 The total mass of microbes within the intestine is almost the same mass of the human brain.

In addition there are significant increases in plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines.The gut microbiota has a significant effect on both the HPA axis and on the immune system pointing to a link between the microbiota and the stress response.Studies have demonstrated that germ-free mice that were raised in a sterile environment had an exaggerated HPA axis response to acute stressors.
