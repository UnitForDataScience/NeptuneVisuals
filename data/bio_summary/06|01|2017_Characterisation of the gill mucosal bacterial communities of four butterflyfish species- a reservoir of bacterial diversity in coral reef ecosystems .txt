Chemotaxis of Vibrio anguillarum to fish mucus role of the origin of the fish mucus the fish species and the serogroup of the pathogen.

Although this study is focused on a specific coral reef fish family the Chaetodontidae these results cast light on the bacterial communities of fish gills bringing new insights on the possible relationship between fish microbiota fish ecology and the surrounding natural environment.SUPPLEMENTARY DATASupplementary data are available at online.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors would like to acknowledge Christine Sidobre for her assistance in DNA extraction and Sonja Fagervold for her sug- gestions for the manuscript.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the labex Corail project MECANO to Pierre Sasal.

We characterised the gill mucus bacterial communities of four butterflyfish species and although the bacterial diversity of gill mucus varied significantly between species Shannon diversities were high H  3.7-5.7 in all species.

The bacterial families and genera with abundances higher than 5 in at least one of the samples were also identi- fied and significant differences between fish species were as- sessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Kruskal post hoc test non-normal data.RESULTSDiversity of bacterial communitiesA total of 1940 OTUs were obtained from the gill mucus of four butterflyfish species C. lunulatus C. ornatissimus C. reticulatus and C. vagabundus.

Overall our re- sults show that gill mucus microbiota is somewhat host-specific but more studies should assess temporal and spatial variability of gill mucus microbiome to confirm the associations presented here.The bacterial communities associated to the gill mucus of the four butterflyfish species were dominated by Proteobacteriawhich is in accordance with previous studies on the gill skin and gut of several fish species Sullam et al.

A potential new species of Neorickettsia has been identified as species specific from skin mi- crobiota of striped mullet Mugil cephalus but their role and im- portance in fish microbiota and coral reefs remains unknown Larsen et al.

.Verrucomicrobia species which were abundant in C. lunula- tus and C. ornatissimus 1-15 mainly an Akkermansia unidenti- fied species have been found in low abundances in different fish tissues gills gut and skin 1 and coral tissues 1-3 Koop- erman et al.

The lowest bacterial diversity was ob- served in C. reticulatus which is a strict corallivore fish that feeds mostly on Acropora corals Harmelin-Vivien  Berumen and Pratchett .Although all fish species were collected at the same sampling site they presented significant microbiome differ- ences.

.Actinobacteria and Firmicutes which seem to constitute the fish core microbiota along with Proteobacteria were abundant in gill mucus of all fish species especially in C. reticulatus andC.

Although the role of Fu- sobacteria and butyrate are poorly understood in fish external surfaces such as gills the previous studies might indicate that they could display protective roles in fish gills.In conclusion we found a high bacterial diversity in gill mu- cus of butterflyfishes many species of which are also found in the coral holobiont either as pathogens or coral-associated bacteria.
