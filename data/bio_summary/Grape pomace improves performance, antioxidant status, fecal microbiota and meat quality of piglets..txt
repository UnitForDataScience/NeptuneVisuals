At 50 days in GP group H2O2 decomposition activity was increased significantly P  0.05 in quadriceps muscle in kidneys and in pancreas by 64.34 29.94 and 84.74 respectively whereas it was decreased significantly P  0.05 in brain and in lungs by 20.16 and 43.03 respectively compared with control group 1b.Microbiological analysis in fecal samplesThe results from the microbiological analysis in fecal samples showed that the population of Enterobacteriaceae was reduced significantly P  0.05 in GP group both at 35 and 50 days post birth compared with the control group by up to1.8 log CFUg 35 days indicating a potential inhibitory effect of GP upon growth of Enterobacteriaceae species in the gut 2a.

Further- more GP inclusion resulted in significantly higher values of ADFI days 35 to 50 and significantly lower values of FCR days 20 to 35 compared with control group 3.Assessment of oxidative stress markers in blood and tissues The results from the assessment of oxidative stress bio- markers in blood showed that CAT activity was decreased significantly by 30.17 P  0.05 in erythrocytes of GP group at 50 days compared with control group 4.

Protein carbonyl levels were also decreased significantly P  0.05 in GP group at 50 days post birth in liver by 37.19 in quadriceps muscle by 25.31 in brain by 31.53 in spleen by 47.87 in lungs by 25.58 in stomach by 35.36 and in pancreas by 55.38 compared with control group 1b.Table 3 Body weight average daily gain ADG average daily feed intake ADFI and feed conversion ratio FCR in growing pigletsGroups1ControlGPBW kgDay 20 BW kg4.80 - 0.324.75 - 0.21Days 20 to 35Days 35 to 50ADG kgday0.179 - 0.010.224 - 0.01ADFI kg feed intakeday0.263 - 0.020.321 - 0.03 FCR kg feed intakekg BW gain1.469 - 0.011.433 - 0.02OverallADG kgday0.186 - 0.010.230 - 0.01ADFI kg feed intakeday0.218 - 0.010.251 - 0.05 FCR kg feed intakekg BW gain1.175 - 0.031.091 - 0.01GP  grape pomace.All data were expressed as the mean - SEM.Significantly different from values of control group P  0.05.1Control standard diet GP diet supplemented with GP.

Significantly different from values of control group at the same sampling time P  0.05.Like CARB TBARS levels were decreased significantly in most of the tested tissues in GP group compared with control group.

At 50 days post birth TBARS levels were also decreased P  0.05 in GP group in liver by 30.16 in heart by 29.52 in quadriceps muscle by 50.35 in spleen by 33.34 in lungs by 23.55 and in pancreas by 34.02 compared with control group 1b.Total antioxidant capacity levels were increased sig- nificantly P  0.05 in GP group at 35 days post birth in pancreas by 27.05 and in stomach by 22.12.

However at50 days post birth GSH levels in GP group were decreased P  0.05 in spleen and stomach by 47.18 and 41.83 respectively compared with control group 1b.Finally at 35 days post birth in GP group H2O2 decom- position activity was increased significantly P  0.05 in kidneys by 28.29 whereas it was decreased significantly P  0.05 in lungs and stomach by 42.24 and 19.70 respectively compared with control 1a.

Interestingly the contents of n-3 FAs and PUFA were increased significantly P  0.05 whereas n-6n-3 ratio was decreased significantly P  0.05 in GP group compared with control group.DiscussionGrowth performanceIn our study growth performance was increased in GP group compared with control group.

In addition the experimental diet increased significantly ADG by 23.65  P  0.05 and enhanced the growth of facultative probiotic bacteria by up to 1.2 log colony forming units CFUg  P  0.05 and lactic acid bacteria by up to2.0 log CFUg  P  0.05 in GP group compared with the control group.

In particular before weaning period ADG was increased in GP group by 22.79 P  0.05 compared with control group.

After weaning period ADG was also increased in GP group by 25.13 P  0.05 compared with control group.
