in the overall period adg was increased by 23.65 p  0.05 compared with control group 3. further- more gp inclusion resulted in significantly higher values of adfi days 35 to 50 and significantly lower values of fcr days 20 to 35 compared with control group 3.assessment of oxidative stress markers in blood and tissues the results from the assessment of oxidative stress bio- markers in blood showed that cat activity was decreased significantly by 30.17 p  0.05 in erythrocytes of gp group at 50 days compared with control group 4. total antioxidant capacity levels were decreased significantly at 35 days by 11.12 p  0.05 in plasma of gp group 4. however gsh levels in erythrocytes as well as carb and tbars levels in plasma did not exhibit any sig- nificant differences p  0.05 in group fed with the experi- mental diet enriched in gp compared with the control group 4. the feed supplemented with gp enhanced the antioxidant mechanisms and improved the redox status in piglets in almost all the tested tissues.

at 50 days post birth tbars levels were also decreased p  0.05 in gp group in liver by 30.16 in heart by 29.52 in quadriceps muscle by 50.35 in spleen by 33.34 in lungs by 23.55 and in pancreas by 34.02 compared with control group 1b.total antioxidant capacity levels were increased sig- nificantly p  0.05 in gp group at 35 days post birth in pancreas by 27.05 and in stomach by 22.12. however at 35 days post birth tac levels were decreased significantly p  0.05 in brain by 30.63 in gp group compared withcontrol group 1a.

at 50 days post birth in gp group gsh levels were increased significantly p  0.05 in liver by 87.28 in heart by 40.74 in brain by 33.33 in kidneys by 80.51 in lungs by 59.09 and in pancreas by 116.86. however at50 days post birth gsh levels in gp group were decreased p  0.05 in spleen and stomach by 47.18 and 41.83 respectively compared with control group 1b.finally at 35 days post birth in gp group h2o2 decom- position activity was increased significantly p  0.05 in kidneys by 28.29 whereas it was decreased significantly p  0.05 in lungs and stomach by 42.24 and 19.70 respectively compared with control 1a.

at 50 days in gp group h2o2 decomposition activity was increased significantly p  0.05 in quadriceps muscle in kidneys and in pancreas by 64.34 29.94 and 84.74 respectively whereas it was decreased significantly p  0.05 in brain and in lungs by 20.16 and 43.03 respectively compared with control group 1b.microbiological analysis in fecal samplesthe results from the microbiological analysis in fecal samples showed that the population of enterobacteriaceae was reduced significantly p  0.05 in gp group both at 35 and 50 days post birth compared with the control group by up to1.8 log cfug 35 days indicating a potential inhibitory effect of gp upon growth of enterobacteriaceae species in the gut 2a.

were increased significantly p  0.05 at 50 days by up to 1.2 log cfug in the gp group compared with the control group 2f.assessment of fatty acids in piglets' meatthe effect of gp inclusion on the fa composition in piglets' meat is summarized in 5. dietary gp supplementation increased significantly p  0.05 the content of lauric acid c12  0 pentadecanoic acid c15  0 palmitelaidic acid c16  1 trans-9 g-linolenic acid c18  3n-6 a-linolenic acid ala c18  3n-3 epa c20  5n-3 behenic acid c22  0and dha c22  6n-3 whereas the content of capric acid c10  0 and arachidic acid c20  0 was decreased significantly p  0.05 in gp group than in control group.

protein carbonyl levels were also decreased significantly p  0.05 in gp group at 50 days post birth in liver by 37.19 in quadriceps muscle by 25.31 in brain by 31.53 in spleen by 47.87 in lungs by 25.58 in stomach by 35.36 and in pancreas by 55.38 compared with control group 1b.table 3 body weight average daily gain adg average daily feed intake adfi and feed conversion ratio fcr in growing pigletsgroups1controlgpbw kgday 20 bw kg4.80 - 0.324.75 - 0.21days 20 to 35days 35 to 50adg kgday0.179 - 0.010.224 - 0.01adfi kg feed intakeday0.263 - 0.020.321 - 0.03 fcr kg feed intakekg bw gain1.469 - 0.011.433 - 0.02overalladg kgday0.186 - 0.010.230 - 0.01adfi kg feed intakeday0.218 - 0.010.251 - 0.05 fcr kg feed intakekg bw gain1.175 - 0.031.091 - 0.01gp  grape pomace.all data were expressed as the mean - sem.significantly different from values of control group p  0.05.1control standard diet gp diet supplemented with gp.

significantly different from values of control group at the same sampling time p  0.05.like carb tbars levels were decreased significantly in most of the tested tissues in gp group compared with control group.

interestingly the contents of n-3 fas and pufa were increased significantly p  0.05 whereas n-6n-3 ratio was decreased significantly p  0.05 in gp group compared with control group.discussiongrowth performancein our study growth performance was increased in gp group compared with control group.

in addition the experimental diet increased significantly adg by 23.65  p  0.05 and enhanced the growth of facultative probiotic bacteria by up to 1.2 log colony forming units cfug  p  0.05 and lactic acid bacteria by up to2.0 log cfug  p  0.05 in gp group compared with the control group.

in particular before weaning period adg was increased in gp group by 22.79 p  0.05 compared with control group.

after weaning period adg was also increased in gp group by 25.13 p  0.05 compared with control group.

in particular carb levels were decreased significantly p  0.05 in gp group compared with control group at 35 days in brain by 30.63 in spleen by 48.62 and in liver by 27.39 1a.

thus at 35 days tbars levels were decreased sig- nificantly p  0.05 in gp group in heart by 41.86 in quadriceps muscle by 45.56 in brain by 30.51 in spleen by 26.6 in kidneys by 33.42 in lungs by 23.36 and in stomach by 27.71 compared with control group 1a.

at 50 days tac levels were increased significantly p  0.05 in quadriceps muscle by 40.77 in kidneys by 54.45 in lungs by 19.81 in sto- mach by 20.17 and in pancreas by 55.11 whereas in brain they were decreased significantly p  0.05 by 18.15 in gp group compared with control group 1b.

reduced glutathione levels were increased in almost all tested tissues in gp group compared with control group.
