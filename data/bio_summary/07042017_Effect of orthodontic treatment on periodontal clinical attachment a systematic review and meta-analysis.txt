Studies that measured clinical attachment loss within the treatment 12 months after appliance insertion found a non-significant attachment gain of 0.24 mm 95 per cent CI  0.68 mm gain to 0.21 mm loss compared to studies that meas- ured clinical attachment loss after treatment completion within the 4 months after appliance removal that found a statistically signifi- cant attachment loss of 0.26 mm 95 per cent CI  0.12 mm to0.40 mm loss.

However the extent to which treatment with fixed appliances might have a lasting adverse effect on the periodontal attachment of the teeth has not yet been investigated in an evidence-based manner.Objectives Aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of comprehensive treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances on clinical attachment levels of adolescent and adult periodontally healthy patients.Search methods Seven databases were searched from inception to February 2017.Selection criteria Prospective non-randomized longitudinal clinical studies.Data collection and analysis After duplicate study selection data extraction and risk of bias assessment according to the Cochrane guidelines Paule-Mandel random-effects meta-analyses of the clinical attachment loss and its 95 per cent confidence intervals CIs were calculated.Results A total of 9 trials were identified that included 335 treated patients at least 34 per cent male  66 per cent female with an average age of 22.6 years.The average pooled clinical attachment loss was 0.11 mm 9 studies 335 patients 95 per cent CI  0.12 mm gain to 0.34 mm loss P  0.338 with high heterogeneity.

Finally there is a risk that measured clinical attachment loss has been overestimated since all studies reported on attachment loss during treatment after appli- ance removal or within the following 3-4 months after applianceremoval where the periodontal connective tissue is probably still lightly inflamed which might lead to deeper penetration by the peri- odontal probe and increased measured attachment loss .ConclusionsAccording to existing evidence from prospective longitudinal studies comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances might have little to no clinically relevant detrimental effect on the clinical attachment levels of patients with malocclusion.

Results of the meta-analysis regarding long-term clinical attachment loss after orthodontic treatment.Tx treatment CI confidence interval Ctr control group.Positive values indicate clinical attachment loss negative values indicate clinical attachment gain.One study is not included as maxillary canines next to intruded maxillary incisors were used as control group such teeth however might be indirectly moved through pull of the alveolar crestal fibers.Figure 3.

The outcome metric used was the clinical attachment loss during orthodontic treatment calculated as attachment level before treatment minus attachment level after treatment so that positive values indicate attachment loss.

Missing or unclear information was requested by the trials' authors.Risk of bias in individual trialsThe risk of bias of included randomized and non-randomized trials was assessed on primary outcome level using Cochrane's risk of bias2.0 tool  and the ROBINS-I Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions tool  respectively.Data synthesisAs clinical attachment loss is bound to vary according to baseline attachment levels oral hygiene treatment- and appliance-related characteristics   and the patient's individual response to orthodontic inflammation  a random-effects model was deemed appropriate based on statistical and clinical reasoning to calculate the distribution of mean clinical attachment loss across studies.

However after taking into account this variation ortho- dontic treatment is still associated with about the same amount of clinical attachment loss 2 studies average of 0.14 mm 95 per cent CI 0.17 mm gain to 0.45 mm loss P  0.373 with the same clinical and statistical significance as the results from uncontrolled studies.Intrusion of anterior teeth on the other side seemed to be associ-ated with a slight attachment gain of treated upper incisors aver- age of 0.63 mm gain 95 per cent CI 0.54 mm to 0.71 mm gain P  0.001 .

The secondary outcomes included were i the clinical attachment loss in untreated patients to assess normal variation of attachment levels and ii the difference in clinical attachment loss between treated and untreated patients.

However it might be difficult to have randomized trials on this sub- ject while as stated above the heterogeneity did affect the direction of clinical decisions.Additional analysesMeta-regression analysis showed a significant modifying effect of patient age on clinical attachment loss P  0.018 with older patients experiencing less attachment loss Appendix 9.

This is in agreement with previous reports on moderate clinical attachment gains attained through low magnitude intrusive forces  but caution is warranted in the interpretation of this finding since only one study with limited sample and moder- ate risk of bias contributed to it.Meta-regression analyses indicated that clinical attach- ment loss was inversely associated with the mean age of treated patients Appendix 9 with older patients experiencing less clin- ical attachment loss.
