additionally timing of the out- come measurement was found to be significantly associated with the results p  0.021. studies that measured clinical attachment loss within the treatment 12 months after appliance insertion found a non-significant attachment gain of 0.24 mm 95 per cent ci  0.68 mm gain to 0.21 mm loss compared to studies that meas- ured clinical attachment loss after treatment completion within the 4 months after appliance removal that found a statistically signifi- cant attachment loss of 0.26 mm 95 per cent ci  0.12 mm to0.40 mm loss.

all nine studies included periodontally healthy patients while two studies also provided a group of patients with previous periodontitis that had been treated successfully and showed no signs of inflammation these patient groups were extracted separately.seven of the nine included studies 78 per cent performed com- prehensive orthodontic treatment average treatment duration of20.1 months table 2 while one study did not report treatment type but was probably comprehensive and another performed only intrusion of upper incisors with a tip-back arch average duration of 8 months the latter being analysed separate from the other trials due to differences in the orthodontic appliances used.the risk of bias of included studies is summarized in and given in detail in appendix 6. according to the robins-i tool which was used on the primary outcome of clinical attachment loss in orthodontically treated patients all of the studies except from one had moderate risk of bias mainly due to absence of blinding which was not wholly practical to use.

assessment of the results of untreated patient groups indicated that small amounts of clinical attachment loss are also seen without treatment 2 stud- ies average of 0.07 mm 95 per cent ci -0.02 to 0.15 mm loss p  0.117. however after taking into account this variation ortho- dontic treatment is still associated with about the same amount of clinical attachment loss 2 studies average of 0.14 mm 95 per cent ci 0.17 mm gain to 0.45 mm loss p  0.373 with the same clinical and statistical significance as the results from uncontrolled studies.intrusion of anterior teeth on the other side seemed to be associ-ated with a slight attachment gain of treated upper incisors aver- age of 0.63 mm gain 95 per cent ci 0.54 mm to 0.71 mm gain p  0.001 .

therefore aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate existing longitudinal studies measuring clinical attachment levels before and after treatment to answer the question 'does orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances lead to clinical attachment loss'materials and methodsprotocol and registrationthe protocol for this review was made a priori registered in prospero crd42017057042 and all post hoc changes were appropriately noted appendix 1. this systematic review was con- ducted and reported according to cochrane handbook  and prisma statement  respectively.eligibility criteriaaccording to the participants-intervention-comparison-outcome- study design schema picos we included parallel randomized and prospective or retrospective non-randomized clinical trials on periodontal healthy human patients receiving comprehensive fixed appliance treatment appendix 2. excluded were animal studies non-clinical studies and studies with active periodontal disease combined periodontic-orthodontic treatment or technique-sensitive periodontally compromising treatments like orthognathic surgery periodontally accelerated orthodontics etc.

however in any case the measured clin- ical attachment loss either during or after orthodontic treatment 0.24 mm gain or 0.26 mm loss respectively remained in the region of clinically negligible effect.the sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were relatively robust in both variation of outcome measurement unit tooth- or patient-reported attachment loss and pooling of multiple patient groups from a single study in the two studies that included either periodontally treated or periodontally healthy patients appendix 10 appendix 11. further sensitivity analyses were planned in the protocol but could not be performed due to limited data appendix 1.discussionthe present systematic review summarizes evidence from existing longitudinal clinical studies on the effect of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances on clinical attachment levels of patients with malocclusion.

finally there is a risk that measured clinical attachment loss has been overestimated since all studies reported on attachment loss during treatment after appli- ance removal or within the following 3-4 months after applianceremoval where the periodontal connective tissue is probably still lightly inflamed which might lead to deeper penetration by the peri- odontal probe and increased measured attachment loss .conclusionsaccording to existing evidence from prospective longitudinal studies comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances might have little to no clinically relevant detrimental effect on the clinical attachment levels of patients with malocclusion.

however the extent to which treatment with fixed appliances might have a lasting adverse effect on the periodontal attachment of the teeth has not yet been investigated in an evidence-based manner.objectives aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of comprehensive treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances on clinical attachment levels of adolescent and adult periodontally healthy patients.search methods seven databases were searched from inception to february 2017.selection criteria prospective non-randomized longitudinal clinical studies.data collection and analysis after duplicate study selection data extraction and risk of bias assessment according to the cochrane guidelines paule-mandel random-effects meta-analyses of the clinical attachment loss and its 95 per cent confidence intervals cis were calculated.results a total of 9 trials were identified that included 335 treated patients at least 34 per cent male  66 per cent female with an average age of 22.6 years.the average pooled clinical attachment loss was 0.11 mm 9 studies 335 patients 95 per cent ci  0.12 mm gain to 0.34 mm loss p  0.338 with high heterogeneity.

the outcome metric used was the clinical attachment loss during orthodontic treatment calculated as attachment level before treatment minus attachment level after treatment so that positive values indicate attachment loss.

based on the nine prospective non-randomized clin- ical studies with 335 treated patients that were included orthodontic treatment might be associated with little to no clinically identifi- able attachment loss pooled average attachment loss of 0.11 mm p  0.05 .

the increased clinical attachment loss in adolescent patients com- pared to adult ones is attributed to poorer plaque control during treatment with subsequent increased pocket probing depths and gingival inflammation .as far as site-specific differences of attachment loss within each patient are concerned no robust conclusions could be draw as the majority of included studies reported results on a patient basis thereby prohibiting meta-analysis.

missing or unclear information was requested by the trials' authors.risk of bias in individual trialsthe risk of bias of included randomized and non-randomized trials was assessed on primary outcome level using cochrane's risk of bias2.0 tool  and the robins-i risk of bias in non-randomized studies - of interventions tool  respectively.data synthesisas clinical attachment loss is bound to vary according to baseline attachment levels oral hygiene treatment- and appliance-related characteristics   and the patient's individual response to orthodontic inflammation  a random-effects model was deemed appropriate based on statistical and clinical reasoning to calculate the distribution of mean clinical attachment loss across studies.

one study had serious risk of bias due to missing data as only 78 per cent of original patients were available and there were strong indications that excluded patients maintained worse oral hygiene than the included ones.data synthesisthe results of the meta-analyses on the primary and the secondary anal- yses can be seen in  an overview of which is given in .comprehensive orthodontic treatment was associated with a mean clinical attachment loss of 0.11 mm 95 per cent ci 0.12 mm gain to 0.34 mm loss p  0.338 which was neither statistically norclinically significant  appendix 7. additionally very high relative heterogeneity i2  99.6 per cent was found which resulted in wide 95 per cent predictions for a future study.

this showed also to be consistent with only a slightly smaller clinical attachment gain when seeing at the differ- ence of treated to untreated patients average gain of 0.49 mm 95 per cent ci 0.36 mm to 0.62 mm gain p  0.001.finally the grade assessment indicated that low to very low quality of evidence existed in both instances due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies and the high heterogeneity appendix 8. however it might be difficult to have randomized trials on this sub- ject while as stated above the heterogeneity did affect the direction of clinical decisions.additional analysesmeta-regression analysis showed a significant modifying effect of patient age on clinical attachment loss p  0.018 with older patients experiencing less attachment loss appendix 9. subgroup analyses indicated that there was no significant difference in thetable 1. characteristics of the patients in the included studies.mf malefemale pnrs prospective non-randomized study eg experimental group ex extraction uni university cg control group not treated nr not reported.two papers classified as a single study although not reported as such due to considerable similarities only subgroup of adolescent patients included as the adult subgroup included patients treated with orthognathic surgery.study reported random patient allocation to oral hygiene measures but no further details given and no separate data for each group provided regarded as a prospective non-randomized study.180european journal of orthodontics 2018 vol.
