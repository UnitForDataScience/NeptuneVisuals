The production rate of acetate in continuous-flow mode was 0.4 gLday Zhang et al.

The main phylum of the HfMBR biofilm was Firmicutes for it has a good tolerance of extreme environment Zhang et al.

The use of hollow-fiber mem- brane could make the in situ usage of the mixed gas Zhang et al.

All of these results indicate that acetate production from mixed culture syngas fermentation in HfMBR has a huge potential for industrial application.Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the finan- cial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China 51478447 National Hi-Technology Development 863 Program of China 2011AA060901 the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethical approval This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.ReferencesAlves JI Stams AJM Plugge CM Alves MM Sousa DZ 2013 Enrichment of anaerobic syngas-converting bacteria from thermo- philic bioreactor sludge.

High acetate production rate .ThermoanaerobacteriumIntroductionSynthetic gas syngas a gaseous mixture normally contain- ing carbon monoxide CO hydrogen H2 and carbon diox- ide CO2 is mainly obtained by the conversion of carbona- ceous minerals such as coal oil natural gas coke oven gas and refinery gas Latif et al.

Pyrolysis or gasification of biomass or sludge also produces a large amount of syngas Chao et al.

Kan et al.

Waste sludge or agricultural wastes that contain lignocellulose can be degraded into syngas by pyrolysis or gasification Ongen et al.

Syngas is a chemical feedstock for ammonia methanol production via well-established process Briens et al.

Gasification of biomass is a promising route to produce syn- gas while leaving a less volume of biomass and minimal foot- print compared with anaerobic digestion Choi et al.
