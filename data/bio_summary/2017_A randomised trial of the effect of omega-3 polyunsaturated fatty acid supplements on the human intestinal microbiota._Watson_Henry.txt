However mouse studies have demonstrated that supplementa- tion with Bifidobacterium breve was associated with increased tissue EPA and DHA content suggesting an influence of intes- tinal microbiota on tissue fatty acid levels.It remains unclear whether RBC omega-3 PUFA levels after oral omega-3 PUFA supplementation predict omega-3 PUFA exposure in the gut lumen.

In the longest comparative study of capsules providing1.68 g EPADHA per day 6 months the RBC omega-3 index was higher after consumption of omega-3 PUFA triglycerides compared with ethyl esters.Our study suggests that at high doses 4 g over several weeks possible small differences in intes- tinal bioavailability related to PUFA delivery are not relevant to omega-3 PUFA tissue incorporation and subsequent changes in the intestinal microbiota.

We describe for the first time that diarrhoea associated with omega-3 PUFA intake is not associated with a significant change in intestinal microbiota or predicted by a particular baseline intestinal microbiome profile.The strengths of this study include the cross-over design that allowed a direct comparison between two omega-3 PUFA formulations thus minimising the effect of interindividual variability in omega-3 PUFA incorporation and intestinal microbiome profileas well as the middle-aged demographic of the study cohort relevant to CRC prevention.

results Both omega-3 PUFA formulations induced similar changes in RBC fatty acid content exceptthat drinks were associated with a larger and more prolonged decrease in omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid than the capsule intervention p0.02.

For the subsequent analyses all capsule Int1 and drink Int2 intervention data were combined regardless of the order of the interventions on the basis of complete tissue RBC omega-3 PUFA washout Gut microbiota Figure 2 Red blood cell PUFA levels during the study.

However neither capsule nor drink intake was associated with statistically significant changes in the FB ratio see online 6.However presentation of data at individual family and genus level revealed consistent differences associated with both capsule omega-3 PUFA and drink omega-3 PUFA interven- tions that returned towards baseline on cessation .

Consis- tent with an interaction between omega-3 PUFAs and fibre Crim et al have reported that fish oil and dietary pectin have synergistic antineoplastic activity in rats.We did not observe any relationship between intestinal microbiome changes and RBC omega-3 PUFA levels a measure of systemic omega-3 PUFA exposure.

In a study of patients n6 with a permanent ileostomy and minimal terminal ileum removed less than 1 of the total oral omega-3 PUFA dose was recovered in ileal effluent suggesting efficient proximal small intestinal absorption.However the daily dose of EPA and DHA was less than 300 mg for 4 days only.It remains unclear what the small intestinal and colonic bioavailability of omega-3 PUFAs is at oral dosing 2000 mg daily.A randomised trial of control versus sardine diet 100 g sardines for 5 days per week for 6 months providing approxi- mately 3 g daily of EPA and DHA combined in type II diabetes patients reported a significant decrease in FB ratio in the sardine diet arm compared with controls.We did not observe a significant change in the FB ratio in our study which may be explained by differences in omega-3 PUFA delivery and duration of the intervention.RBC fatty acid changes were similar during either the drink or capsule intervention with a significant increase in RBC EPA and DHA and a parallel decrease in AA content consistent with dosing at 4 g per day for 8 weeks.It is not clear why the drink intervention was associated with a larger decrease in relative AA content which led to a significantly higher EPADHAAA ratio.

The excellent acceptability and tolerability aligned with good omega-3 PUFA absorption characteristics mirrors previous experience with an earlier version of the Smartfish drink.The aetiology of the dose-dependent diarrhoea caused by omega-3 PUFA intake in up to 5-10 of individuals remains unclear.

We also did not obtain data on the background diet and dietary omega-3 PUFA intake.In summary we report that a high dose 4 g daily of mixed omega-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA given for 8 weeks is associated with small changes in the intestinal microbiota that are consistent across two different omega-3 PUFA interventions.The increase in density of bacteria known to be butyrate producers concurs with the existing preclinical literature and is compatible with the known anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties of omega-3 PUFAs.contributors HW and FCC performed the randomised study and collected samples.
