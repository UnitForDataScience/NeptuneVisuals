int1.1 and int1.2 denote visitssamples before and after the capsule intervention regardless of the intervention order a then b and b then a. int2.1 and int2.2 are corresponding time-points for the drinks intervention regardless of intervention order.

having excluded a significant treatment order effect on both rbc omega-3 pufa incorpora- tion and the intestinal microbiome profile data for the capsule intervention termed int1 and the drink intervention termed int2 were combined regardless of the intervention order either a or b.resultstwenty-two participants were randomised between july 2015 and april 2016 .

all the aes during the capsule intervention and the aes in 910 individuals during the drink intervention had resolution of the ae during washout suggesting that these were definite adverse reactions.changes in rbc omega-3 pufa contentfatty acid analysis was performed on those samples from partic- ipants who completed one or both intervention periods and washout n20.

in a study of patients n6 with a permanent ileostomy and minimal terminal ileum removed less than 1 of the total oral omega-3 pufa dose was recovered in ileal effluent suggesting efficient proximal small intestinal absorption.however the daily dose of epa and dha was less than 300 mg for 4 days only.it remains unclear what the small intestinal and colonic bioavailability of omega-3 pufas is at oral dosing 2000 mg daily.a randomised trial of control versus sardine diet 100 g sardines for 5 days per week for 6 months providing approxi- mately 3 g daily of epa and dha combined in type ii diabetes patients reported a significant decrease in fb ratio in the sardine diet arm compared with controls.we did not observe a significant change in the fb ratio in our study which may be explained by differences in omega-3 pufa delivery and duration of the intervention.rbc fatty acid changes were similar during either the drink or capsule intervention with a significant increase in rbc epa and dha and a parallel decrease in aa content consistent with dosing at 4 g per day for 8 weeks.it is not clear why the drink intervention was associated with a larger decrease in relative aa content which led to a significantly higher epadhaaa ratio.

all aes were defined as minor any symptom experienced during intervention but did not require cessation of intervention or dose reduction except for three aes in each group that were classified as moderate any symptom experienced that required subsequent dose reduction or cessation of intervention and led to cessation of the inter- vention.

a paired t-test comparing the treatment effect in otu reads between the capsule and drink intervention for the 17 individ- uals who had complete paired before and after intervention data revealed that the drink intervention was associated with increased abundance compared with capsules for roseburia only p0.05.

two individuals withdrew from gut microbiotaas there was no significant difference in rbc pufa levels related to the order of intervention data for individual pufas were pooled independently of the intervention order for the further comparison of drinks and capsules .

our data are also consistent with the concept that short-term dietary interventions do not overcome the dominant interindividual variation in the intestinal microbiome.the increased abundance of butyrate-producing so-called 'beneficial' bacterial genera such as bifidobacterium lachno- spira roseburia and lactobacillus during one or both types of omega-3 pufa intervention is consistent with the mouse litera- ture.whether the relatively small changes in intes- tinal microbiome that we observed at the end of the 8-week intervention period have functional consequences including an increase in luminal scfa levels is a question that will require a metabolomic approach including lipidomic profiling.

results both omega-3 pufa formulations induced similar changes in rbc fatty acid content exceptthat drinks were associated with a larger and more prolonged decrease in omega-6 pufa arachidonic acid than the capsule intervention p0.02.

for the subsequent analyses all capsule int1 and drink int2 intervention data were combined regardless of the order of the interventions on the basis of complete tissue rbc omega-3 pufa washout gut microbiota figure 2 red blood cell pufa levels during the study.

however mouse studies have demonstrated that supplementa- tion with bifidobacterium breve was associated with increased tissue epa and dha content suggesting an influence of intes- tinal microbiota on tissue fatty acid levels.it remains unclear whether rbc omega-3 pufa levels after oral omega-3 pufa supplementation predict omega-3 pufa exposure in the gut lumen.

in the longest comparative study of capsules providing1.68 g epadha per day 6 months the rbc omega-3 index was higher after consumption of omega-3 pufa triglycerides compared with ethyl esters.our study suggests that at high doses 4 g over several weeks possible small differences in intes- tinal bioavailability related to pufa delivery are not relevant to omega-3 pufa tissue incorporation and subsequent changes in the intestinal microbiota.

we describe for the first time that diarrhoea associated with omega-3 pufa intake is not associated with a significant change in intestinal microbiota or predicted by a particular baseline intestinal microbiome profile.the strengths of this study include the cross-over design that allowed a direct comparison between two omega-3 pufa formulations thus minimising the effect of interindividual variability in omega-3 pufa incorporation and intestinal microbiome profileas well as the middle-aged demographic of the study cohort relevant to crc prevention.

after a 12-week 'washout' period participants took the second intervention for 8 weeks intervention b .
