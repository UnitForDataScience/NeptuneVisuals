A subgroup rapidly progress to complicated disease behaviours with stricturing and possible bowel obstruction or internal penetrating fistulas or both often resulting in intra-abdominal sepsis.3 Previous reports about the natural history of Crohn's disease have shown rates of complicated disease ranging from 48 to 52 5 years after diagnosis.4 Factors associated with complicated disease behaviours include age at diagnosis ileal disease location serological responses to various microbial antigens and possibly cumulative genetic risk.4Despite substantial progress in understanding of the immune pathogenesis of Crohn's disease little is known about the precise mechanisms responsible for disease complications.5 Wound healing triggered by inflammation might lead to tissue repair or fibrosis depending on the balance between production and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins.4 In Crohn's disease stricturing occurs when regeneration and repair fail to restore normal tissue architecture and bowel wall thickening leads to luminal narrowing.6 Internal penetration develops as a result of active transmural inflammation of the bowel wall with or without distal luminal narrowing.

The substantial heterogeneity in disease course suggests a strong host biological component with conditioning affected by environmental and intestinal microbial factors.The impact of available therapies specifically anti-tumour necrosis factor a TNFa agents on the natural history of Crohn's disease remains unclear.7 Discovery of factors contributing to disease complications and prediction of the risk of such complications in children presenting with non-stricturing and non-penetrating Crohn's disease is crucial to guide therapeutic decisions.

In 2008 the Risk Stratification and Identification of Immunogenetic and Microbial Markers of Rapid Disease Progression in Children with Crohn's Disease RISK study was initiated to characterise prospectively the natural history of newly diagnosed Crohn's disease in children presenting with an uncomplicated disease state.

In fact eight additional patients who had a B2 complication were classified as high risk on the basis of the extracellular matrix gene signature appendix who otherwise would have been classified as low risk in the model on the basis only of clinical factors including ileal location and serology.DiscussionBecause no validated models for prediction of risk of stricturing or penetrating complications are available in Crohn's disease we did a prospective inception cohort study in children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease.

Additionally we showed that early anti- TNFa therapy reduced penetrating but not stricturing complications.Patients with Crohn's disease typically show inflammatory disease behaviour at diagnosis with some patients' disease then progressing to stricturing or internal penetrating complications.15 Despite increased use of anti-TNFa therapy over the past decade a population-level decline in rates of obstructive complications and surgeries has not been recorded.717 Although a Danish cohort study showed a reduction in Crohn's disease surgeries between 1979 and 2011 an association with specific drugs was not established.18 Disease complications particularly penetrating complications substantially increase health-Kugathasan et al.Page 9care costs.

The strongest effect was noted for CBir1 seropositivity to bacterial flagellin which is induced at an early age and could be involved in pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.20 Flagellin is a dominant antigen driving mucosal T-cell responses in Crohn's disease and both flagellin-specific T cells and antiflagellin antibodies exacerbate inflammation in murine colitis.21 We therefore tested for an association between ileal microbiota and complications.

Collectively these results advance understanding of the pathogenesis of disease complications and inform more personalised approaches for children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by a research initiative grant from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America New York NY USA.
