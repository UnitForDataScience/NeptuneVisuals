Our results could then be evaluated against biofilm communities recorded within other shale play studies as well as those utilizing non- microbial indicators within the Fayetteville shale  In addition to assaying for potential effects of fracking on stream biofilm communities other potential anthropogeniceffects that drive biofilm communities such as agriculture silviculture urbanization etc.

Microbial communities are also extraordinarily diverse composed of numerous rare OTUs and display a rapid response to changes in temperature pH and stream metabolism  This also provoke taxonomic turnover in stream biofilm communities as an ecosystem-scale response  Given this stream biofilm communities can be employed to only to gauge ecosystem health but also its potential im- pacts on humankind .

Although our multivariate analyses did not provide statistical probabilities within a hypothesis- testing framework they more easily depicted the disparity within- and among-Groups as promoted by watershed land use and water chemistry.The variability in biofilm communities among study sites Having established the environmental context for our sampling sites by Group we could then contrast their biofilm communities Fig.

Unfortunately the breadth and depth of biofilm communities are also confounding factors that can limit diagnostic and taxonomic projections par- ticularly with regard to bioremediation.Region specific issues also predominate For example biofilm communities are quite sensitive to changes in landuse This is important in that both the Fayetteville and Barnett shale catchments display pre-existing anthropo- genic disturbances that can easily confound more focused analyses regarding the impacts of UNG-activity.

Biofilm communities at PICZ-sites were significantly less variable than those at MICZ-sites.Conclusions Study streams differed by Group according to morphology land use and water chemistry but not in biofilm community structure.

Those at PICZ-sites covaried according to anthropogenic impact and were qualitatively similar to communities found at sites disturbed by fracking.

organisms whose presence absence or abun- dance can reflect a specific environmental condition particularly in the context of adaptive stream management.Biofilm communities in streams sensu lato are com- posed of sessile organisms on substrata and thus have an intimate contact with and long-term exposure to flowing waters.

For example the Cyanobacterial component of biofilm can contribute 80 of the primary production in a system whereas other biofilm components such as hetero- trophic bacteria employ complex metabolic pathwaysthat can quickly remediate harmful substances The composition of biofilm is radically transformed by alterations in stream conditions  with deterioration directly impacting the aquatic food base such that ram- ifications are quickly translated into higher trophic levels Although biofilm communities play a major role in the dynamics of stream ecosystems they have been traditionally difficult to monitor due largely to a time-consuming process of optical identification coupled with an inability to initiate andor sustain la- boratory cultures for identification Molecular advances have now largely ameliorated these issues by facilitating identification and quantification of bacterial constituents in the biofilm community.

Furthermore the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies has improved accuracy and reduced costs  making community characterization an attractive procedure with which to gauge ecosystem health.A molecular genetic approach was utilized in the current study to assay biofilm communities of selected streams within a 932-km2 region of Fayetteville shale located in the Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas Fig.
