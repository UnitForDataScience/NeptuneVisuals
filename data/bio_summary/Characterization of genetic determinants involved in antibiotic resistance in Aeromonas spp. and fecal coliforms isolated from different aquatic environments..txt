southern blot analysis revealed that integrons were located on a plasmid in 12 strains belonging to a. media 5 strains a. hydrophila 3 strains aeromonas sobria 2 strains and aeromonas caviae 2 strains.

however we could not detect common mobile structures in these two bacterial populations and we were able to transfer antibiotic resistance through conjugation only with four aeromonas strains.these finding therefore question the notion that coliform contamination may act as a vector for gene transfer to the naturally aquatic aeromonas spp.

original articlecharacterization of genetic determinants involved in antibiotic resistance in aeromonas spp.

we recovered 231 aeromonas and 250 fecal coliforms from water samplings with different degrees of pollution hospital sewage activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant river water before and after treatment and water from an alpine lake.

sixteen aeromonas spp.

and 22 fecal coliforms carried inti coding for the site-specific integrase of class 1 integrons while 22 aeromonas spp.

integrons and transposons were mainly located on mobilizable plasmids.our results did not detect common mobile structures in the two populations and therefore relativize the role played by aeromonas spp.

aeromonas are gram-negative oxidase-positive bacilli and are ubiquitous in aquatic environments where they are exposed to the actions of micropollutants such as residual antibiotic compounds that may possibly be present .

in water aeromonas spp.

they therefore represent two major populations of cultivable bacteria differently submitted to the selective pressure of antibiotics that may interact with each other in water environmentsinterchanging and spreading antibiotic resistance .in order to gain insight into the role of these two pop- ulations in the spread of antibiotic resistance in natural aquatic environments we studied the presence and distribution of transposons integrons and resistance plasmids in aeromonas spp.

filters were placed on two commercial media biolife m-aeromonas selective agar base supplemented with ampicillin added as a selective agent since aeromonads are generally resistant to it for isolation of aeromonas spp.
