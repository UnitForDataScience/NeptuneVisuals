against VRE colonization.Lastly successful eradication of MDRO using fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with hematologic disease has been reported with a high abundance of members of the Bacteroidales order characterizing the post- FMT microbiota of patients in whom MDRO was successfully eradicated.In this study the microbiome of patients not colonized with an MDRO also showed greater abundance of the Bacteroidales order suggesting that this order may reflect a healthier microbiome that is more resistant to MDRO colonization.Metagenomic prediction revealed a higher abundance of genes among MDRO patients related to several pathways implicated in multidrug resistance the 2-component system the ATP-binding cassette system and the phosphotransferase system.-These results are consistent with our phenotypic identification of MDROs using classical culture-dependent microbiological methods and they highlight the potential to identify metabolic pathways and their byproducts as potential biomarkers of MDRO colonization which may be widely applicable considering the functional stability of the human microbiome.A recent study by Zhernakova et alshowed that the protein chromogranin A retrieved from the stool had a strong negative correlation with microbial diversity in the gut suggesting that this fecal biomarker could be used to ascertain gut health.

Furthermore 11 patients were colonized with at least 1 MDRO at hospital admission among whom 5 patients were cocolonized with 1 MDRO and 7 patients 63.6 had a history of MDRO colonization in the previous year.

MDIs could be used to develop rapid MDRO detection methods and to prompt placement of patients on isolation precautions in an effort to limit MDRO spread.We previously reported MDIs in the fecal microbiomes of patients who acquired MDROs during their hospitalization and showed that a greater abundance of Lactobacillus spp.

The MDROs isolated atbaseline were Escherichia coli n  4 Klebsiella pneumoniae n  3 Proteus mirabilis n  1 Citrobacter freundii n  1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa n  1 VRE n  3 and MRSA n  3.Compared to MDRO- patients MDRO patients had a significantly higher Charlson comorbidity index 7 IQR 6-9 vs 4 IQR 3-7 P  .05.

Using this optimal cutoff the Shannon index correctly classified 86.4 of the 44 patients according to their MDRO status.The composition of the bacterial communities of MDRO and MDRO- patients also differed significantly.

First the within-group distances were significantly lower in MDRO- compared to MDRO patients Bonferroni corrected nonparametric P  .01 indicating that samples among MDRO- patients were more homogeneous than the samples of MDRO individuals 2A.

Compared with MDRO- patients the intestinal microbiota of MDRO patients had substantially lower microbial diversity even after adjusting forfigure 3.

Similarly the intestinal microbiota of patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection CDI in particular those with severe disease is also characterized by reduced microbial diversity compared to controls.Although data suggest that reduced microbial diversity itself does not constitute a causalmechanism for developing disease it may be considered a biomarker of a disrupted microbiota.Substantial differences in the composition of bacterial communities between the MDRO- and MDRO patients were also identified.

To characterize the microbial disruption indices of hospitalized patients to predict colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms MDROs.design.

The study population consisted of adult patients hospitalized in general medicalsurgical wards.methods.
