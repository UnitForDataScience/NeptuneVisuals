the mdros isolated atbaseline were escherichia coli n  4 klebsiella pneumoniae n  3 proteus mirabilis n  1 citrobacter freundii n  1 pseudomonas aeruginosa n  1 vre n  3 and mrsa n  3.compared to mdro- patients mdro patients had a significantly higher charlson comorbidity index 7 iqr 6-9 vs 4 iqr 3-7 p  .05. the mdro patients were more frequently exposed to healthcare-associated facilities 90.9 vs 57.6 p  .07 and they had greater antimicrobial exposure during the 3 months prior admission 90 vs 48.4 p  .02. age gender diabetes mellitus obesity gastrointestinal disease and current use of proton pump inhibitors were similar between mdro and mdro- patients p  .5 and fecal microbiome assessmenta total of 44 baseline rectal specimens were successfully sequenced yielding 3638570 high-quality 16s rrna gene sequences after quality filtering with a median number of sequences per sample of 84752 iqr 68472-96133. alpha diversity metrics were estimated at a sequencing depth of 7300 reads per sample.

against vre colonization.lastly successful eradication of mdro using fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with hematologic disease has been reported with a high abundance of members of the bacteroidales order characterizing the post- fmt microbiota of patients in whom mdro was successfully eradicated.in this study the microbiome of patients not colonized with an mdro also showed greater abundance of the bacteroidales order suggesting that this order may reflect a healthier microbiome that is more resistant to mdro colonization.metagenomic prediction revealed a higher abundance of genes among mdro patients related to several pathways implicated in multidrug resistance the 2-component system the atp-binding cassette system and the phosphotransferase system.-these results are consistent with our phenotypic identification of mdros using classical culture-dependent microbiological methods and they highlight the potential to identify metabolic pathways and their byproducts as potential biomarkers of mdro colonization which may be widely applicable considering the functional stability of the human microbiome.a recent study by zhernakova et alshowed that the protein chromogranin a retrieved from the stool had a strong negative correlation with microbial diversity in the gut suggesting that this fecal biomarker could be used to ascertain gut health.

furthermore 11 patients were colonized with at least 1 mdro at hospital admission among whom 5 patients were cocolonized with 1 mdro and 7 patients 63.6 had a history of mdro colonization in the previous year.

mdis could be used to develop rapid mdro detection methods and to prompt placement of patients on isolation precautions in an effort to limit mdro spread.we previously reported mdis in the fecal microbiomes of patients who acquired mdros during their hospitalization and showed that a greater abundance of lactobacillus spp.

using this optimal cutoff the shannon index correctly classified 86.4 of the 44 patients according to their mdro status.the composition of the bacterial communities of mdro and mdro- patients also differed significantly.

first the within-group distances were significantly lower in mdro- compared to mdro patients bonferroni corrected nonparametric p  .01 indicating that samples among mdro- patients were more homogeneous than the samples of mdro individuals 2a.

compared with mdro- patients the intestinal microbiota of mdro patients had substantially lower microbial diversity even after adjusting forfigure 3. linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse showing differential abundance of taxa between mdro and mdro-.table 3. differentially abundant genes associated with multidrug-resistance mechanisms that significantly differed between mdro- and mdro according to the metagenomic prediction of 16s rrna sequence datanote.

similarly the intestinal microbiota of patients with recurrent clostridium difficile infection cdi in particular those with severe disease is also characterized by reduced microbial diversity compared to controls.although data suggest that reduced microbial diversity itself does not constitute a causalmechanism for developing disease it may be considered a biomarker of a disrupted microbiota.substantial differences in the composition of bacterial communities between the mdro- and mdro patients were also identified.

the study population consisted of adult patients hospitalized in general medicalsurgical wards.methods.

rectal swabs were obtained from patients within 48 hours of hospital admission and screened for mdro colonization using conventional culture techniques.

microbial diversity and composition as well as the functional potential of the microbial communities present in fecal samples were compared between patients with and without mdro colonization.results.

a total of 44 patients were included in the study of whom 11 25 were colonized with at least 1 mdro.

reduced microbial diversity and high abundance of metabolic pathways associated with multidrug-resistance mechanisms characterized the fecal microbiome of patients colonized with mdro at hospital admission.conclusions.

our data suggest that microbial disruption indices may be key to predicting mdro colonization and could provide novel infection control approaches.infect control hosp epidemiol 2017 38 1312 - 1318 infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms mdros are associated with significant mortality and carry an impor- tant economic burden.microbiome dysbiosis defined as an imbalance between beneficial and potentially deleterious microorganismsis associated with increased risk of mdro colonization and infection.the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has begun to work on developing microbiome disruption indices mdis characteristics of microbiome dysbiosis that can identify patients at increased risk of mdro colonization infection and transmission.
