For example an altered microbiota composition was noted in studies of 62 swabs from the tonsillar pillars  200 subgingival samples  30 mar- ginal and subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples  and oral wash samples comparing 13-41 current smokers with 77-194 never smokers in 4 groups and 64 saliva samples  by sequencing 16S rRNA gene and in a study of 292 stimulated oral samples by Hu- man Oral Microbe Identification Microarray HOMIM .

Moreover Additional file Figure S1 indicates that alpha diversity in the buccal mucosa is lower in smokers as described above.Regardless of the smoking status microbiota among the oral sites differed greatly Fig.

Larger studies are needed to further examine oral and nasal microbiota effects produced by behaviors such as cigarette smoking.MethodsStudy subjectsFollowing the approval by the institutional review boards of the National Cancer Institute and University of Rochester 23 current smokers median duration 15 years median intensity 15 cigarettes per day and20 nonsmokers 100 cigarettes in a lifetime were re- cruited at Eastman Institute of Oral Health University of Rochester.

The effect of a supragingival plaque-control regimen on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-Smokers evaluation by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

and comparing them between never smokers and current smokers.

Smokers had slightly higher periodontal screening and recording PSR scores than nonsmokers.By the Wilcoxon rank-sum test smokers did not differ significantly from nonsmokers at any site on any measure of alpha diversity beta diversity or taxa-relative abun- dance with one exception--PDwhole tree diversity was lower in the smokers' buccal mucosa p  0.05 Fig.

The current study examined this question by characterizing the microbiota in eight oral sites and a nasal swab Fig.

We found no difference in any microbial measurement by age gender race alcohol consumption and PSR score data not shown.DiscussionOur study reported an effect of cigarette smoke on the oral microbiota in the buccal mucosa.

Previous studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the effect of smoking on the oral microbiota.

Some studies - re- ported no association between oral microbiota and smok- ing.
