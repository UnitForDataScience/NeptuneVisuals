For example an OTU with no close relatives at species or genus level can be classified at the family level facilitating the interpretation of the results.We incorporate in the datasets recently discovered endolithic limestone-boring algal lineages to facilitate the identification of these algae in other studies.The script provided here facilitates the development of custom reference databases for non- standard metabarcoding markers.DataThe datasets of this article provide reference sequences of the elongation factor Tu tufA and the Universal Plastid Amplicon UPA loci and their corresponding taxonomic information.

The tufA reference dataset contains bacterial and chloroplast tufA sequences including green algae red algae heterokonts cryptophytes and haptophytes.

Since there are no reference sequences for Ostreobium Clade 1 and Clade 2 it is possible that OTUs belonging to Ostreobium Clades 1 and 2 will be classified as Clades 3 and 4 or will be only classified at higher taxonomic levels.The reference datasets were equalized so as not to contain identical sequences or a disproportional number of closely related species which yields downstream benefits for taxonomic assignment see .

To equalize the datasets and exclude closely related or identical reference sequences we built a UPGMA tree of the sequences with a JC69 model.
