a recent study has also directly compared the subgingival microbiota of smokers diabetics and diabetic-smokers with chronic periodontitis but used an open-ended molecular technique of pyrosequencing to map the entire microbial spectrum.25 the results demonstrated that the specific environmental processes generated by dm smoking and by the combination of both affect the microbiome in different ways.table 3 mean - sd median counts log10 of periodontal pathogens for all sites healthy plus diseased sitesthere were no differences among groups by mixed-model anova followed by post hoc analyses with the bonferroni correction p  .05. dm diabetes mellitus s smoking sd standard deviation sdm smoking plus dm.table 4 mean - sd median counts log10 of periodontal pathogens for healthy sites pd and cal 3 mm with no bopdifferent letters ab indicate that groups are different by the mixed-model anova followed by post hoc analyses with the bonferroni correction p  .05. dm diabetes mellitus s smoking sd standard deviation sdm smoking plus dm.table 5 mean - sd median counts log10 of periodontal pathogens for diseased sites pd and cal 5 mm with bopinteraction between groups and the covariate genderdifferent letters indicate differences among groups according to mixed-model anova followed by post hoc analyses with the bonferroni correction p  .05.dm diabetes mellitus s smoking sd standard deviation sdm smoking plus dm.smokers with periodontitis showed a robust core microbiome dom- inated by anaerobes.

p. micra is a fastidious gram-positive an- aerobic cocci33 which has been recognized as a putative periodontal pathogen because it is found in high frequency and high levels in peri- odontitis lesions and is able to predict the worsening of periodontal parameters.34 the findings of the current study are in agreement with those of previous studies that also observed a relationship between the presence of p. micra and smoking habit in patients with periodonti- tis employing cultures35 checkerboard dna-dna hybridization10 and real-time pcr.23 remarkably haffajee and socransky10 reported an increased extent of p. micra colonization predominantly at sites with probing depth 4 mm in smokers compared to non-smokers.

therefore plausible explanations for the exacerbated periodontitis in these risk groups might be attributed to micro- organisms other than the 7 target species or to the whole of the subgingival bacterial biodiversity and the microbial co-occurrence patterns as recently suggested.25 furthermore the negative im- pact of dm and smoking on the immunoinflammatory responses against pathogens might be also critical in worsening of disease progression and severity.5-7a strong point of this study is that 4 sites matched for clinical pa- rameters were analyzed individually per group providing a view of the microbiological aspects of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in these patients.

therefore it appears that dm and smoking jointly and individually do not considerably affect the levels and prevalence of key periodontal pathogens in patients with chronic periodontitis.in the current study sites matched for clinical parameters ie probing depth clinical attachment level and bleeding in patients with chronic periodontitis presenting a cigarette smoking habit type 2 dm and both conditions exhibited no significant differences in their prevalence and levels of any of the bacterial species studied.

there were no differences among groups for the mean numbers of almost all bacterial species studied p  .05 except for the mean levels of p. micra that were statistically significantly higher in the healthy sites of both cigarette smoking groups than in those of the control group p  .05. table 5 presents the mean number of periodontal pathogens for the diseased sites.

these findings may indicate that cigarette compounds can affect the colo- nization of periodontal sites by p. micra particularly at shallow sites.

two sites from each of the following categories were sampled probing depth and clinical attachment level 3 mm with no bop and no mb healthy sites and probing depth and clinical attachment level 5 mm with bop diseased sites.

therefore the aim of this study was to compare the combined and individual effects of dm and smoking on the levels and prevalence of key subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with chronic periodontitis.material and methods one hundred patients with generalized chronic periodontitis were allocated into one of the following groups dm n  25 non-smokers with type 2 dm s n  25 non-diabetic smokers sdm n  25 smokers with type 2 dm and control n  25 non-diabetic non-smokers.

both dm and tobacco smoking are recognized as major risk factors for destructive periodontal dis- eases as diabetics and smokers evidently experience higher incidence severity and progression of periodontitis than non-smokers and non- diabetic patients.1-4although the harmful clinical impacts of dm and smoking on peri- odontal diseases is well established the actual mechanisms by which these modifying factors lead to the exacerbation of periodontal de- struction are not fully understood.

it seems that the immune responses against pathogens might be affected by sex hormones and by the dif- ferential expression of x-chromosome-encoded genes.3940 whether and to what extent these sex-related factors also affect the subgin- gival microbiota needs to be further investigated.as neither cigarette smoking nor dm nor the association of both conditions profoundly affected the subgingival levels of the 7 target periodontal pathogens the more severe periodontal de- struction observed in diabetics and smokers does not seem to becaused by alterations in the levelsprevalence of these species specifically.
