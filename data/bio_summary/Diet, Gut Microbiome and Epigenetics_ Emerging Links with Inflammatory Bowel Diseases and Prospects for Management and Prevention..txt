other nutritional interventions or specific diets including the specific carbohydrate diet scd the low fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyol fodmap diet and most recently the mediterranean diet have shown strong anti-inflammatory properties and show promise for improving disease symptoms.

in this inception cohort study high intake of caffeine was associated with an increased risk of surgery severe disease course and higher treatment step in cd patients in uc patients daily fast food intake was associated with an increased risk of surgery and high intake of caffeine was associated with a higher risk of extra-intestinal manifestations and lower treatment step.in an attempt to fill this gap in recent years more effort has gone into evaluating specific diets for the management of ibd such as the specific carbohydrate diet scd and the low fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyol fodmap diet.

collectively the pathogenic mechanisms for ibd could be largely imposed by gene-environment interactions switching on a cascade of induced effects on the microbiota the immune system and the mucosal barrier figure .here we review the recent developments in understanding the role of the gut microbiome epigenetics and dietary factors in ibd that outline directions for disease management and prevention.figure 1. proposed patho-physilogical mechanisms for inflammatory bowel disease ibd.

new trends in inflammatory bowel disease epidemiology and disease course in eastern europe.

among the environmental factors associated with ibd diet plays an important role in modulating the gut microbiome influencing epigenetic changes and therefore could be applied as a therapeutic tool to improve the disease course.

more work is required to evaluate the role of individual food compounds and complex nutritional interventions with the potential to decrease inflammation as a means of prevention and management of ibd.keywords diet gut microbiota epigenetics inflammatory bowel diseasesintroductionthe inflammatory bowel diseases ibd--crohn's disease cd and ulcerative colitis uc--are two diseases characterised by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.

probiotics and other commercial interventions such as tea or berry extracts would be unlikely to counteract an unhealthy diet and used alone may analogous to other medicinal products such as antioxidant supplements fail to improve primary or secondary disease prevention .

nevertheless accumulating linesof research reveal certain microbes that communicate with their hosts by sending out metabolites influencing gene transcription in the colon and potentially driving disease development.diet immunity and ibdwestern diet is characterised by overconsumption of refined sugars salt and saturated fat and low consumption of dietary fibre as well as overall low food variability.

these include the food and resulting microbial metabolites farmm study by the crohn's and colitis foundation of america ccfa  the study on the genetic environmental and microbial interactions that cause ibd gem project by the crohn's and colitis canada  the prognostic effect of environmental factors in crohn's and colitis predicct study  and the diet microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease course microibdiet study.
