Among the environmental factors associated with IBD diet plays an important role in modulating the gut microbiome influencing epigenetic changes and therefore could be applied as a therapeutic tool to improve the disease course.

Nevertheless the current dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management are scarce and have weak evidence.

Hence exclusive enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease is the only nutritional intervention currently recommended as a first-line therapy.

Other nutritional interventions or specific diets including the Specific Carbohydrate Diet SCD the low fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyol FODMAP diet and most recently the Mediterranean diet have shown strong anti-inflammatory properties and show promise for improving disease symptoms.

More work is required to evaluate the role of individual food compounds and complex nutritional interventions with the potential to decrease inflammation as a means of prevention and management of IBD.Keywords diet gut microbiota epigenetics inflammatory bowel diseasesIntroductionThe inflammatory bowel diseases IBD--Crohn's disease CD and ulcerative colitis UC--are two diseases characterised by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.

However genetic risk loci identified to date only explain a small part of the genetic variance in disease risk and more factors need to be taken into account for understanding the multifactorial pathology of IBD .

Collectively the pathogenic mechanisms for IBD could be largely imposed by gene-environment interactions switching on a cascade of induced effects on the microbiota the immune system and the mucosal barrier Figure .Here we review the recent developments in understanding the role of the gut microbiome epigenetics and dietary factors in IBD that outline directions for disease management and prevention.Figure 1.
