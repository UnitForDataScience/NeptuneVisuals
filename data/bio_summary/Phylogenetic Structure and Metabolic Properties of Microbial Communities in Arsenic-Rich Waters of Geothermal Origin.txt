This work aims to explore the phylogenetic composition and functional properties of aquatic microbial communities in As-rich freshwater environments of geothermal origin and to elucidate the key microbial functional groups that directly or indirectly may influence As-transformations across a natural range of geogenic arsenic contamination.

Nitrate-linked microbial transformation were also shown to play an important ecological role in As-contaminated aquaticenvironments  .Our study aimed to evaluate the structural and phylogenetic patterns in the microbiome of As-rich waters of geothermal origin as those typically found in the Cimino-Vico volcanic area Central Italy and to elucidate the key microbial functional groups that directly or indirectly may influence As- transformations across a natural range of geogenic arsenic contamination.MATERIALS AND METHODSSampling SiteWater samples were collected from the Cimino-Vico volcanic area Central Italy Supplementary Figure S1 a complex hydrogeological system characterized by several perched aquifers and a continuous basal aquifer flowing through volcanites  .
