this work aims to explore the phylogenetic composition and functional properties of aquatic microbial communities in as-rich freshwater environments of geothermal origin and to elucidate the key microbial functional groups that directly or indirectly may influence as-transformations across a natural range of geogenic arsenic contamination.

nitrate-linked microbial transformation were also shown to play an important ecological role in as-contaminated aquaticenvironments  .our study aimed to evaluate the structural and phylogenetic patterns in the microbiome of as-rich waters of geothermal origin as those typically found in the cimino-vico volcanic area central italy and to elucidate the key microbial functional groups that directly or indirectly may influence as- transformations across a natural range of geogenic arsenic contamination.materials and methodssampling sitewater samples were collected from the cimino-vico volcanic area central italy supplementary figure s1 a complex hydrogeological system characterized by several perched aquifers and a continuous basal aquifer flowing through volcanites  .

major phyla and classes of proteobacteria was normalized by logx1.a multi-group similarity percentage test simper performed on ngs data using the euclidean similarity measure was run to identify the microbial phylogenetic groups that were primarily responsible for observed differences between thermal waters and groundwaters.non-parametric manova npmanova was used to test if microbial taxa obtained from 16s rrna bar-coded pyrosequencing differed statistically among thermal waters and groundwaters.resultswater chemistrymajor physical and chemical parameters t ph ec do hco3- so4-2 differed significantly based on water origin .
