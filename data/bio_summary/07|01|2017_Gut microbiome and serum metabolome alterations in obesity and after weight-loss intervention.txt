we identified obesity-associated microbial species and their effects on host amino acid profiles and using a mouse model we uncovered evidence of causal effects of b. thetaiotaomicron on adiposity and circulating amino acid levels.resultsobesity-associated genes and taxonomic alterations identified by metagenome-wide association studieswe performed shotgun sequencing of 257 fecal samples 151 samples from 72 obese individuals and 79 lean controls in the first cohort 49 samples from 23 obese individuals and 26 controls in the second cohort and 63 samples from 23 obese individuals including 6 in the case group subjected to sg supplementary fig.

cia was performed on mlg abundance profiles and metabolite abundance profiles of control and obese samples to assessthe relationship between mlgs and metabolites that differed in abundance between control and obese individuals.

comparison between shotgun sequencing data of stool samples from lean controls n  79 and obese individuals n  72. a rarefaction curves based on gene count in lean controls and obese individuals.

briefly for a given number of samples we performed a randomized sampling 79 and 72 times in the control samples and obese samples respectively and estimated the total number of genes that could be identified from these samples.

of the 2981416 identified genes 350524 genes differed in abundance between controls and obese subjects two-tailed wilcoxon rank-sum test p  0.01 fdr  0.05. these genes were subsequently clustered into mlgs according to their abundance variation across all samples.

we found that the abundance of genes related to 'lps biosynthesis' and 'peptidoglycan biosynthesis' was higher in the microbiome of obese individuals than in that of lean controls which may be related to the observed higher serum concentration of lbp tnfa and il6 in obese individuals supplementary table 1. furthermore amino- acid-metabolism-related pathways involving 'phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis' and modules of 'glutamineglutamateaspearman's correlation-0.500.5        ob-8293 ob-8295 ob-8241dorea longicatena 9343ruminococcus obeum 7058 eubacterium hallii 7132 coprococcus comes 6940                                               dorea longicatena 7570    ob-7834                                           ob-8283                                         bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 11069                                                   faecalibacterium prausnitzii 13388                                                                  bacteroides intestinalis 2808bacteroides intestinalis 211                             bacteroides intestinalis 243                                 bacteroides intestinalis 173                                                     con-1216     veillonella sp.

we further found that the abundance of 14 case-enriched mlgs was decreased at 1m and the abundance of 20 case-enriched mlgs was substantially decreased by 3m whereas the abundance of 8 and 37 control-enriched mlgs was substantially increased at 1m and 3m respectively supplementary fig.

briefly the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient was used to calculate the rela- tionship between genes according to their abundance and then the chameleon algorithm was applied to cluster the genes into mlgs.taxonomic assignment and abundance profiling of the mlgs supplementary table 3 were performed according to the taxonomy and the relative abundance of the constituent genes using the method previously described.

intestinalis and b. thetaiotaomicrion ranked in the top ten mlgs that significantly differed in abundance between lean and obese sub- jects adjusted p  0.05 wilcoxon rank-sum test supplementary table 3. we also observed a higher abundance of firmicutes and a trend toward a decreased bacteroidetesfirmicutes ratio p  0.062 wilcoxon rank-sum test in obese individuals supplementary fig.

cca was performed on the mlg abundance profiles of samples from obese and lean individuals to assess the effect of each amino acid listed.

differential abundance of phyla genera species mlgs and kos were tested by two-tailed wilcoxon rank-sum test in controls and obese individ- uals and two-tailed wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test in the case of treat- ment samples.

unclassified mlgs could not be annotated to any taxonomic level as a result of the low gene annotation rate 11 on average see supplementary table 3. the numbers in parentheses next to each species name represent unique mlg identifiers.584 kos differed in abundance between lean and obese subjects p  0.01 supplementary table 10. furthermore kegg pathways belonging to the 'phosphotransferase system' involved in import- ing carbohydrate were highly enriched in the microbiome of obese individuals as compared with lean controls and the phosphotrans- ferase system modules were positively correlated with species from the firmicutes phylum.
