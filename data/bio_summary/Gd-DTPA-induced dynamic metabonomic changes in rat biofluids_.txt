the decline of cre- atine indicated that gd-dtpa might disrupt the homeostasis of crea- tine-phosphocreatine system.conclusionsin conclusion gd-dtpa administration effects were reflected in a number of metabolic pathways including lipid metabolism glucose me- tabolism tca cycle amino acid metabolism and gut microbiota func- tions.

urine and serum samples were collected on days 1 2 and 7 after dosing.results metabolic responses of rats to gd-dtpa administration were systematic involving changes in lipid me- tabolism glucose metabolism tca cycle amino acid metabolism and gut microbiota functions.

urinary and serum metabonomic recovery could be observed in both the 2 and 5 mmolkg body weight group but the met- abolic effects of high-dosed 5 mmolkg body weight gd-dtpa lasted longer.

it is worth noting that hyperlipid- emia was observed after gd-dtpa injection and nicotinate might play a role in the subsequent self-recovery of lipid metabolism.

the disturbance of tyrosine glutamate and gut microbiota metabolism might associate with the progression of nsf.conclusion these findings offered essential information about the metabolic changes induced by gd-dtpa and could be potentially important for investigating the pathogenesis of nsf at the early stage.

moreover the recov- ery of rats administrated with gd-dtpa may have implications in the treatment of early stage nsf.c 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.introductionmagnetic resonance imaging mri contrast agents are widely used to add significant morphological and functional information to unenhanced magnetic resonance images .

the main objectives of this work were 1 to un- derstand the gd-dtpa-induced dynamic metabonomic changes and 2 to investigate the potential metabolic disturbances associated with the pathogenesis of nsf at the early stage.materials and methodschemicalsmagnevist gd-dtpa 0.5 moll was purchased from bayer schering pharma ag berlin germany.

fifty-six animals were randomly divided into three groups the con- trol group n  8 the low-dose group lg n  24 and the high-dose group hg n  24. forty eight rats were received a single tail vein in- jection of gd-dtpa 2 mmolkg body weight for the lg group 5 mmol- kg body weight for the hg group.

dose levels in this study were set according to the acute oral half lethal doses ld50 for rats of gd-dtpa and the literature .

eight rats from each gd-dtpa treated group were sacrificed on days 1 2 and 7 after dosing.

phosphate in the buffer could precipitate gadolinium from gd-dtpa .

spss 18.0 spss inc. was employed for statistical evaluation.resultsserum clinical chemistrythe effects of gd-dtpa on serum clinical biochemistry parameters are presented in .
