The decline of cre- atine indicated that Gd-DTPA might disrupt the homeostasis of crea- tine-phosphocreatine system.ConclusionsIn conclusion Gd-DTPA administration effects were reflected in a number of metabolic pathways including lipid metabolism glucose me- tabolism TCA cycle amino acid metabolism and gut microbiota func- tions.

The corre- sponding loading plots were generated with an in-house modified Matlab script  and were color-coded with the absolute value of coefficients r. In this study a correlation coefficient of  r N 0.667 for the degree of freedom  7 was used as the cutoff value for the statistical significance on the basis of the discrimination significance at the level of p b 0.05 which was determined according to the test for the significance of the Pearson's product-momentcorrelation The quality of each model was described by the parameters R2 for the interpretability of the model and Q2 for the predictability of the model.

The disturbance of tyrosine glutamate and gut microbiota metabolism might associate with the progression of NSF.Conclusion These findings offered essential information about the metabolic changes induced by Gd-DTPA and could be potentially important for investigating the pathogenesis of NSF at the early stage.

The main objectives of this work were 1 to un- derstand the Gd-DTPA-induced dynamic metabonomic changes and 2 to investigate the potential metabolic disturbances associated with the pathogenesis of NSF at the early stage.Materials and methodsChemicalsMagnevist Gd-DTPA 0.5 molL was purchased from Bayer Schering Pharma AG Berlin Germany.

The ALB level significantly decreased in rats exposed to the high dose of Gd-DTPA.1H NMR spectroscopy of urine and serumRepresentative 1H NMR spectra of urine and serum obtained from control and Gd-DTPA treated rats were shown in  respec- tively.

The alterations  induced by Gd-DTPA were consistent with the results of multivariate statistical analysis.

The concentrations ofglucose were reduced in serum after Gd-DTPA administration.

The level of tyrosine was also significant increased after the administration of GdCl3 which means that the release of gadolinium ion from Gd-DTPA might lead tothe elevation of serum tyrosine.

The metabonomic strategy offers a promising approach to investigate the potential adverse effects of Gd-DTPA and to detect the pathogenesis of NSF at the early stage.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the financial support of National Natural Science Foundation of China 21305134 and Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province 20160101074JC for this work.Appendix A.
