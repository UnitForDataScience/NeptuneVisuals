In contrast both responses were inhibited by transfer of MLN DCs from DNFB-fed B6 but not TLR422 mice  showing that DCs from MLNs of hapten-fed mice can transfer tolerance to DNFB and that their tolerogenic function critically relies on TLR4 expression.TLR4 conditions migration of CD1031 DCs in MLNs in response to hapten gavageIntestinal DCs sampling intestinal antigens constantly migrate at steady state from the lamina propria through LNs to MLNs.These data show that DNFB gavage induces mobilization of migratory CD1031 DCs expressing RALDH to MLNs and that TLR4 is required for such dynamic.TLR4 is required for hapten presentation to T cells by migratory DCsTo examine whether DCs mobilized by hapten gavage had also captured DNFB we used an ex vivo hapten presentation assay with hapten-specific CD81 T cells as responders.Interestingly un- fractionated CD11c1 DCs from DNFB-fed B6 but not TLR422 mice induced hapten-specific CD81 T-cell proliferation  A left whereas DCs of both origin induced comparable T-cell proliferation when pulsed in vitro with the hapten  A right.

This indicates that induction of oral tolerance to DNFB relies particularly on TLR4 expression on hematopoietic cells.Oral tolerance can be transferred by MLN DCs and this requires TLR4Oral tolerance to protein antigens critically requires myeloid- type migratory intestinal DCs which transport antigens from the gut lamina propria to MLNsand express TLR4.To investigateA400300200100A250200150100500B6TLR4--B30020010000B5004003002001000C100806040200B6 B6 TLR4-- TLR4--32  10250200150100500 B6 B6 ns TLR4-- TLR4--FIG 3.

Indeed TLR4 conditioned the in vivo mobilization to mesenteric lymph nodes of intestinal migratory CD1031 DCs carrying oral DNFB especially the CD1031CD11b1 DC subset expressing the vitamin A- converting enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase and specialized in forkhead box p3-positive regulatory T-cell conversion.Conclusions Our data demonstrate that TLR4 conditions induction of oral tolerance to DNFB through licensing tolerogenic gut DCs.

These might include CXC3CR11 macrophages which capture intestinal antigensand transfer them to neighboring CD1031 DCs for oral tolerance induction.The respective role of TLR4 expressed by DCs versus other hematopoietic cells in oral tolerance remains to be determined.We provide evidence that MLN DCs from hapten-fed TLR4-deficient mice display a reduced proportion of RALDH- expressing cells and an impaired capacity to efficiently convert naive CD41 T cells into Foxp31 Treg cells in the presence of latent TGF-b.

These data indicate that migratory CD1031CD11b1 DCs mobilized to MLNs in a TLR4-dependent way by means of DNFB gavage also transport and present the hapten to T cells.TLR4 deficiency impairs conversion of Foxp31 Treg cells by MLN DCsThanks to the presence of RALDH-expressing CD1031 DCs MLNs are an essential site for neoconversion of Foxp31 Treg cellswhich control local and systemic DTH responses to die- tary antigens.To determine whether TLR4 conditions the ability of MLN DCs to induce Treg cells during oral tolerance weAB B6TLR4--vehicleB6DNFBvehicleDNFBvehicleDNFBTLR4--27.7MHC IICD103CD11bCD103CD11b-CD103-3040201000CvehicleB6DNFB2520151050DCD103CD11bCD103CD11b-86420TLR4--2081561045200RALDHFIG 4.

Remarkably DCs from hapten-fed TLR422 mice were poorly efficient at inducing Foxp31 Treg cell differentiation in the presence of latent TGF-b  C. These data indicate that TLR4 expression critically conditions the capacity of MLN DCs to induce Foxp31 Treg cell conversion in the presence of latent TGF-b during oral toler- ance to DNFB.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that induction of oral tolerance to DNFB and efficient prevention of ACD in mice involves a major microbiota-dependent component and critically relies on TLR4 expression.

We previously documented that oral probiotic treatment alleviates the CHS response to DNFB by acting on both effector and Treg cells suggesting that commensal bacteria in the gut can regulate immune responses at a remote skin site.In the present study we show that the presence of a normal flora or TLR4 is crucial for induction of oral tolerance and suppression of CHS responses and that TLR4 licenses tolerogenic intestinal DCs and their ability to induce Foxp31 Treg conversion in thepresence of latent TGF-b.METHODSMiceSix- to 10-week-old specific pathogen-free SPF and GF C3HHeN mice were bred in pathogen-free Texler-type isolators La Calh ene Velizy France and fed ad libitum under sterile conditions at the animal facility of theIFN-g ELISpotThe frequency of hapten-specific IFN-g-producing T cells was determined on day 5 after skin DNFB sensitization by using the ELISpot assay as previously described.Briefly serial numbers of either total or purified CD81 T cells were restimulated in vitro with 0.4 mmolL DNBS in nitrocellulose 96-well plates coated with the anti-IFN-g mAb R46A2 from PharMingen San Diego Calif.

Finally a hapten like DNFB can bind to microbiota components such as LPS the signaling of which through TLR4 on myeloid cells could account for the TLR4 dependency of oral tolerance.Taken together our data demonstrate that oral tolerance to haptens relies critically on TLR4 expression on hematopoietic cells which conditions mobilization of migratory CD1031 DCs and hapten presentation to T cells for efficient control of CD81 T cell-mediated DTH responses and ACD.

Toll-like receptor TLR-mediated sensing of the microbiota contributes to gut homeostasis yet whether it contributes to induction of oral tolerance has not been documented.Objective We examined whether oral tolerance to the contact sensitizer 24-dinitro-fluorobenzene DNFB depends on microbiotaTLRs and evaluated the role of TLR4 on the tolerogenic function of intestinal dendritic cells DCs.Methods Oral tolerance was induced by DNFB gavage in germ- free and mice deficient in several TLRs.

In addition the ALDEFLUOR assay revealed that DNFB gavage augmented the frequency and number of RALDH1 migratory22B6 TLR4--B6 TLR4--B6 TLR4--B6 TLR4--DCs in MLNs of B6 mice but not TLR4mice  C andFIG 2.
