Notably Beijing and Nagasaki samples were clustered farther from each other and Seoul samples were clustered in between indicating that the bacterial communities of Beijing and Nagasaki were more different than those of Beijing and Seoul or Seoul and Nagasaki.

PM2.5 concentrations were measured in China South Korea and Japan and measurement systems were installed on the rooftops of the School of Public Health buildings at Peking University in Beijing Seoul National University in Seoul and Nagasaki University in Nagasaki.

Red circles green rectangles and blue triangles represent the numbers of species in the Beijing Seoul and Nagasaki sites respectively.b Diversity of the Beijing red circles and Seoul green rectangles sites divided by that of the Nagasaki site.Figure 4. a Heat map of the identified phylotypes at the genus level where identified phylotypes are in black and unidentified phylotypes are in white.

B-S S-N and B-N represent comparisons between Beijing and Seoul Seoul and Nagasaki and Beijing and Nagasaki respectively.

The Bray-Curtis similarity between Seoul and Nagasaki was 0.73 and that between Beijing and Nagasaki was 0.66.

This result is interesting because the three locations are in different country they are very far from each other 952 km from Beijing to Seoul 596 km from Seoul to Nagasaki and 1442 km from Beijing to Nagasaki and the environ- ments near them are different but yet the seasonal variation is greater.

PCA showed that the bacteria community in Seoul was in between those of Beijing and Nagasaki and Bray-Curtis similarity analysis demonstrated that airborne bacteria in Seoul were more similar to those in Beijing than those in Nagasaki except during summer.

Beijing China had more diverse airborne bacteria followed by Seoul South Korea and Nagasaki Japan and seasonal variations were observed.

Beijing and Seoul had more diverse airborne bacteria during the winter whereas Nagasaki showed greater diversity during the summer.
