According to metagenomic analysis results Zhu et al 6 found that 37Mbp contig sequences from gut microbes of the giant panda recovered putative genes coding cellulosedigesting related enzymes in Clostridium group I showing that the giant pandas had evolved a number of traits to overcome the anatomical and physiological challenge of digesting a diet high in fibrous matter.Thus the objective of present study was to reveal the dynamic changes of the gut microbial community during yaks' growth and to understand the benefits of gut microbiota on nutrient meta bolism of hosts by PCRDGGE and metagenomic sequencing in order to assist the searching for potential probiotics which could be beneficial to yaks' growth through supplementary feeding with these probiotics agents.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample collectionGut content samples from 0.5 1.5 and 2.5 years old of male yaks were collected immediately after slaughtering snapfrozen in liquid N2 and shipped to the laboratory.

Comparative metagenomics of gut microbiota in 0.5 1.5 and 2.5yearold yaks revealed that the abundance of the class Clostridia Bacteroidia and Lentisphaeria as well as the phylum Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Lentisphaerae Tenericutes and Cyanobacteria varied more greatly during yaks' growth especially in young animals 0.5 and 1.5 years old.

While there is the potential to resolve these problems by feeding supplementary silage forage with microbial agents to regulate the gastrointestinal microbiota of yaks which may promote the normal growth of yaks.

Based on the research guidelines these yaks were managed as one group in a large lot owned by Sichuan Grassland Science Academy.DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction amplification DNA was extracted from 15 gut contents samples 5 yaks in each age group using the Stool DNA Kit OMEGA Norcross GA USA according to the protocol for isolation of DNA for pathogen detection.

Principal component analysis PCA was performed on meancentered data to visualize the general structure of species level composition of gut microbiome using the Canoco for Windows 4.5 Software.Metagenomics analysisDNA was extracted from gut content of 15 yaks 5 yaks in each age group using the Stool DNA Kit OMEGA USA according to the standardized protocol.

Corrected pvalues were calculated using the Bonferroni correction.RESULTSComparison of detectable bacteria in the gut from different age of yaks using PCR-DGGE analysisTo identify detectable species of microbes present in the gut from different age of yaks we applied PCRDGGE profiles analysis.

This is similar to the previous study in human gut microbiota 9.Using gene functional classification in a metagenomic analysis of gut contents samples from yaks we detected sequences homo logous to genes coding 14betacellobiosidase EC 3.2.1.91 46 genes bglucosidase EC 3.2.1.21 45090 genes 14bxylosidase EC 3.2.1.37 608 genes and endo14bxylanase EC 3.2.1.8 6656 genes which participate in the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose indicating that quite a few gut microbes including the genus Clostridium Lachnospira and Ruminococcus play im portant role in digesting cellulose in yaks.

These changes might be influenced by the stress of weaning and shift in food composition besides the age factor as 0.5 years old of yaks were still not weaned while yaks above one year old were fed on grass.

In view of the increasing proportions of Clostridia and Lentisphaeria as well as the cor responding phylum Firmicutes and Lentisphaerae in older yaks' gut while maintaining the same variation of amino acids meta bolic pathways indicates that these gut microbiota may participate in the metabolism of amino acids thus furthers affects protein utilization and anabolism in yaks.Because of the semiopen farming system and the lack of sufficient feed stuff in rangelands in winter and spring some standardized rangelands have begun to feed supplementary silage forage to yaks in order to reduce animals' high mortality in winter and spring.
