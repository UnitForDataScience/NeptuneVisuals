according to metagenomic analysis results zhu et al 6 found that 37mbp contig sequences from gut microbes of the giant panda recovered putative genes coding cellulosedigesting related enzymes in clostridium group i showing that the giant pandas had evolved a number of traits to overcome the anatomical and physiological challenge of digesting a diet high in fibrous matter.thus the objective of present study was to reveal the dynamic changes of the gut microbial community during yaks' growth and to understand the benefits of gut microbiota on nutrient meta bolism of hosts by pcrdgge and metagenomic sequencing in order to assist the searching for potential probiotics which could be beneficial to yaks' growth through supplementary feeding with these probiotics agents.materials and methodssample collectiongut content samples from 0.5 1.5 and 2.5 years old of male yaks were collected immediately after slaughtering snapfrozen in liquid n2 and shipped to the laboratory.

comparative metagenomics of gut microbiota in 0.5 1.5 and 2.5yearold yaks revealed that the abundance of the class clostridia bacteroidia and lentisphaeria as well as the phylum firmicutes bacteroidetes lentisphaerae tenericutes and cyanobacteria varied more greatly during yaks' growth especially in young animals 0.5 and 1.5 years old.

while there is the potential to resolve these problems by feeding supplementary silage forage with microbial agents to regulate the gastrointestinal microbiota of yaks which may promote the normal growth of yaks.

based on the research guidelines these yaks were managed as one group in a large lot owned by sichuan grassland science academy.dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction amplification dna was extracted from 15 gut contents samples 5 yaks in each age group using the stool dna kit omega norcross ga usa according to the protocol for isolation of dna for pathogen detection.

the similarity matrices were pro duced using the dice similarity coefficient which allowed for the construction of dendrograms using the unweighted pairwise grouping method with mathematical averages upgma method 14. principal component analysis pca was performed on meancentered data to visualize the general structure of species level composition of gut microbiome using the canoco for windows 4.5 software.metagenomics analysisdna was extracted from gut content of 15 yaks 5 yaks in each age group using the stool dna kit omega usa according to the standardized protocol.

twoway comparisons of taxo nomic distributions between metagenomic samples were tested within stamp using the fisher's exact test associated with the newcombewilson method for calculating confidence intervals nominal coverage of 95. corrected pvalues were calculated using the bonferroni correction.resultscomparison of detectable bacteria in the gut from different age of yaks using pcr-dgge analysisto identify detectable species of microbes present in the gut from different age of yaks we applied pcrdgge profiles analysis.

classifications of the kos assigning to functional categories are shown in figure 4 suggesting that the gut microbiome of yaks has enriched activity for metabolism of carbohydrates 9.8 proteins 12.3 amino acids 14.4 nucleotides 6.8 glycans 2.1 lipids 1.7 xenobiotics 1.4 cofactors and vitamins 3.6. moreover pairwise comparative significant difference of gut microbial kegg functional analysis of our data from the yaks of 0.5 1.5 and 2.5 years old by fisher's exact test figure 5 demonstrated the most prominent differences involved dietrelated processes such as energy metabolism carbohydrate metabolism amino acid me tabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins as well as xenobioticassociated functions such as membrane transport and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism.

this is similar to the previous study in human gut microbiota 9.using gene functional classification in a metagenomic analysis of gut contents samples from yaks we detected sequences homo logous to genes coding 14betacellobiosidase ec 3.2.1.91 46 genes bglucosidase ec 3.2.1.21 45090 genes 14bxylosidase ec 3.2.1.37 608 genes and endo14bxylanase ec 3.2.1.8 6656 genes which participate in the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose indicating that quite a few gut microbes including the genus clostridium lachnospira and ruminococcus play im portant role in digesting cellulose in yaks.

amino acids metabolic pathways were disclosed to be dominant in all yak gut samples by gene functional classification figure 4 which increased linearly with yaks' age figure 5. examples include amino acidsfigure 4. relative abundance of sequences assigned to different metabolic profiles predicted from kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database in yak gut content.figure 5. significant difference of gut microbial function composition in yaks analyzed by fisher's exact test.

these changes might be influenced by the stress of weaning and shift in food composition besides the age factor as 0.5 years old of yaks were still not weaned while yaks above one year old were fed on grass.

in view of the increasing proportions of clostridia and lentisphaeria as well as the cor responding phylum firmicutes and lentisphaerae in older yaks' gut while maintaining the same variation of amino acids meta bolic pathways indicates that these gut microbiota may participate in the metabolism of amino acids thus furthers affects protein utilization and anabolism in yaks.because of the semiopen farming system and the lack of sufficient feed stuff in rangelands in winter and spring some standardized rangelands have begun to feed supplementary silage forage to yaks in order to reduce animals' high mortality in winter and spring.

over 50 of nonrrna gene sequences represented the metabolic pathways of amino acids 14.4 proteins 12.3 sugars 11.9 nucleotides 6.8 lipids 1.7 xenobiotics 1.4 coenzymes and vitamins 3.6. gene functional classification showed that most of enzymecoding genes were related to cellulose digestion and amino acids metabolic pathways.conclusion yaks' age had a substantial effect on gut microbial composition.

gut microbes including bacteroides clostridium and lentisphaeria make a contribution to the energy metabolism and synthesis of amino acid which are essential to the normal growth of yaks.keywords polymerase chain reactiondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcrdgge metagenomic sequencing metabolic pathways gut microbiota yakintroductionyak bos grunniens is the only bovine species adapted to the special highaltitude ecological environment of the qinghaitibet plateau and semidomestic yaks provide the basic resources such as meat milk transportation dung for fuel and hides for tented accommodation that are necessary for tibetans and other nomadic pastoralists living there 1. herbivorous mammals rely on resident gut microorganisms to gain energy from their main food sources and this has entailed major changes in digestive anatomy and physiology that allow efficient microbial fermentation to take place alongside the recovery of dietary energy by hosts.
