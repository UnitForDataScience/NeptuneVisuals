The possibility to modify the intestinal microbiota by pre- or probiotics may have a huge impact on anti-cancer therapy in the future and therefore warrants further research.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to extend our gratitude to Univ.-Prof. Dr. Christian Urban for his support and the Steirische Kinderkrebshilfe for funding this project.Furthermore we would like to thank Silvia Schauer and Anna Kuesz the two medical technicians who helped to realize this project.CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.REFERENCES Park HJ Moon EK Yoon JY et al.

How- ever an investigation of cell cultures performed by Goldberg et al.25TA B L E 3 Analysis of the microbiome of the ileal contentshas shown that LC induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cell death in NB cell lines while making cultures of normal human neurons resis- tant to such cell death.Similar to the effect of LC on healthy cells the tertiary bile acid UDC has been shown to exert antiapoptotic effects by reducing reac- tive oxygen species and protecting the mitochondrial membranes.26-28 Additionally anti-inflammatory effects via the inhibition of nuclear fac- tor kappa B mediated TNF- secretion have been demonstrated for UDC.2729 Moreover UDC substitution in a rat model of hepatoma had no effect on tumor growth but reduced lipolysis and weight loss and improved the survival rate.30 Although more research will be required reduced LC and UDC levels as seen in our TG may be associated with increased inflammation cachexia and tumor progression.In addition to tissue wasting and increased energy metabolism reduced appetite seems to be an important factor of the negative energy balance associated with TAC.31 Neuropeptide Y NPY plays an important role in appetite regulation.

Mice received four sub- peritoneal depots of 500000 tumor cells per depot tumor group TG n  8 or four depots of 0.1 ml culture medium each sham group SG n  8.

To the best of our knowl- edge this is the first study reporting disturbances of the ileal micro- biome inflammation and intestinal hormones in a murine NB model.Similar to tumor models of adult cancer we found alterations in the intestinal microbiome in tumor animals.11 Although the differences were not statistically significant the ileal contents in this investiga- tion showed a clear trend toward decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes Beferribacteres and Tenericutes in tumor-bearing animals.Regarding the microbiota on the species level however our findings differ from reports examining other tumors.

The abdomen was closed with continuous sutures and the mice were allowed to recover on the heat plate.Mice were weighed on a weekly basis and tumor growth was observed.

The detailed results of the microbiome analysis are shown in Table 3 and Supplementary Material S2.DISCUSSION In the present study an altered composition of the intestinal micro- biota coupled with a pro-inflammatory state cachexia as well as changes in serum lipids and the bile acid profile in a murine model of human NB was demonstrated.NB represents the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood.1 For this investigation we were able to generate a model ofFIGURE 2 Chemokinecytokine profiling of serum samples.

Ghrelin is produced by the mucosa of the gastric fundus and stimulates NPY and agouti-related protein AGRP in the hypothalamus leading to increased appetite.3233 A potential important role of ghrelin in TAC has been demonstrated in a recent report showing that treatment with ghrelin improved food intake and ameliorated weight loss in cachec- tic mice.34 The exact mechanisms causing a decrease in ghrelin levels in our tumor animals still remain unclear.

Controversially an investigation of gastrointestinal hormones in rats with NB showed different results with increases in GLP-1 and ghrelin as well as decreases in PYY in tumor animals.8 The underlying reason for this contradictory finding remains unclear at present.The present investigation describes profound alterations of both the gastrointestinal microbiome and the metabolism in an experi- mental model of NB.
