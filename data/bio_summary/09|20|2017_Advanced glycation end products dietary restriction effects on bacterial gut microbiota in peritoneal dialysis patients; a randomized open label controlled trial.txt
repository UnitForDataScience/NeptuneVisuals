Operational taxonomic units were annotated and analyzed at species levels and shows no difference in microbiota projection onto the principal components at baseline A followed by changes after dietary intervention B.

APDCAPD Automated peritoneal dialysisContinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.Baseline gut microbiota profile in ESRD patients on PDTo better understand the compositions of bacterial gut microbiota in ESRD patients on PD we first performed a descriptive analysis to evaluate the relative abundance at phyla genus and species levels.

This is of certain importance as when each species relative abundance was tested and compared between the two groups a limited set of bacteria have shown a significant rela- tive abundance differences after changing AGE dietary habits.

The top ten species in relative abundance 74 are shown in Fig 3A full species are shown in .Shannon-Wiener diversity index indicating no differences among groups before and after intervention bars and columns represent diversity index mean - standard deviation.

The human gut harbors numerous bacterial species and this study is not powered to accurately identify the small changes in all species relative abundance changes.

Dietary AGE restriction may thus result in gut microbiota changes that could play a mechanistic role in the previously observed cardio-protection properties.This study represents a step towards addressing this and further experimental and population- based studies are warranted.Limitations and conclusionEven though this study identified multiple bacterial species with altered relative abundance after dietary intervention these findings should be read with caution.

Moreover results of serum AGE measurements before and after intervention suggest dietary compliance.In summary our findings again confirm that even short-term restriction of dAGE intake can significantly decrease circulating AGE levels in renal failure patients on maintenance peri- toneal dialysis and further suggest that this dietary intervention may have an effect in the gut microbiota.

Restriction of dietary glycotoxins reduces excessive advanced glycation end products in renal failure patients.
