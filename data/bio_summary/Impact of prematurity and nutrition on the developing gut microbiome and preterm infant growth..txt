If the notches of two boxes within the same gray panel do not overlap on the y axis there is strong evidence that the true medians differ Functional pathways that are differentially enriched among the three phases include those that contribute to the degradation of phthalates on NICU medical devices bisphenol degradation protection against oxidative stress carotenoid biosynthesis microbiota driven increases in lipopolysaccharide LPS concentrations lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis short-chain fatty acidsfatty acid biosynthesis isoquinoloine alkaloid biosynthesis glycolysis and gluconeogenesis glycan biosynthesis and metabolism membrane transport and translationTable 2 Associations of weight Z-score with microbiome phase nutrition and clinical covariatesSignificant covariatesp valueBeta value Ratio of proteins to total calories gcal  phase 2 0.007110.95Calorieskilogram past week 0.0001 - 0.626Proportion of calories enteral 0.0001 - 0.5566Corticosteroids past week  phase 10.0035 0.3669Diuretics past week  phase 10.0002 0.3393Diuretics past week  phase 2 0.0001 0.3306Motility agents past week  phase 20.0003 - 0.3144Diuretics past week 0.0001 - 0.2266Antibiotics past week 0.0001 - 0.2176Motility agents past week0.0087 0.1522Gestational age at birth0.0165 0.059Multiple regression associations of weight Z-score as the outcome variable with microbiome phase nutrition and other clinical covariates as well as the interactions between phases and clinical covariates interaction terms denoted with an asterisk.

Transition from one phase to the next consecutive phase is more likely than the transition from a higher phase to a lower phase e.g.

Significant associations with weight Z-score include gestational age at birth the phase of the microbiota the ratio of major macronutrients the proportion of calories administered enterally the receipt of motility agents antibiotics diuretics corticosteroids and several interaction terms between medicationnutrition and the phase of the microbiota Table The significance with respect to weight Z-score of interaction terms between relative lipid and protein intake and the phase of the microbiota indicate that the observed association between these macronutrients and growth depends on the composition of the gut microbiota and differs between microbiota phases.The longitudinal patterns of rectal microbiota phase transitions for 95 preterm and 25 full-term subjects are shown in Fig.

Testing the median dissimilarity revealed that it is significantly higher when the phase changed between consecutive samples than when it remained the same p  0.0001 suggesting discrete periods of community restructuring corresponding to phase transition.We quantified the pattern of progression of the gutmicrobiota with respect to the order of phase transition events using the sequence of phases observed in the consecutive samples from each individual infant to com- pute the transition probabilities between the phases.

For each phase the probability that the subsequent sample from the same individual will be in the same phase is higher than the probability of transitioning to a different phase Fig.

Overall our results demonstrate that the phase-based model of gut microbiota development in the preterm infant provides a more robust explanation of the data than the period-based model.Potential associations of nutrition and medications with phaseAfter identifying the microbiota phase as a significant factor in infant growth we sought to identify potential associations of nutrition and medications with phase by including them as explanatory variables and microbiota phases P1 and P2 as the outcome with P3 as the baseline phase in a multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression model.

Finally additional metrics of host gut physiology and immune and metabolic development can be incorporated into future studies as they may provide insights into the factors driving phase progression as well as the potential impact of phase transition on the newborn's growth and development.ConclusionTo our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an association between gut microbiota phase nutritional in- take and growth of preterm infants.

In our study we introduce two models to identify associations between the microbiota nutritional intake medication and preterm infant growth a categorical model based on three quantitatively defined phases P1 P2 and P3 that corresponds to three states of the microbiota and a PMA-based model with the three composition-based phases replaced by two constant time periods identified as early  34 weeks PMA n  362 datapoints and late  34 weeks PMA n  343 data points.Our analyses identified more significant associations with phase which led us to use the phase-based framework to explore potential functional relationships between the pre- term microbiota nutrition and growth.We first defined the phases and phase transition points in longitudinal gut microbiota samples from two cohorts of preterm and full-term infants from the multicenterdevelopment in a cohort of 95 preterm and 2 full-term in- fants from PROP and 23 full-term infants from RPRC at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.

Finally we demonstrate that transition out of phase 1 P1 occurs simultaneously with transition from meconium to normal postnatal stool a milestone that can be unambiguously identified at the bedside.Overall our results illustrate an ecological framework for the preterm infant gut microbiome and represent a significant first step in tailoring nutrient intake accord- ing to microbiota phase.
