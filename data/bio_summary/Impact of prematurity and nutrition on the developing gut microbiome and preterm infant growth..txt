transition from one phase to the next consecutive phase is more likely than the transition from a higher phase to a lower phase e.g.

significant associations with weight z-score include gestational age at birth the phase of the microbiota the ratio of major macronutrients the proportion of calories administered enterally the receipt of motility agents antibiotics diuretics corticosteroids and several interaction terms between medicationnutrition and the phase of the microbiota table the significance with respect to weight z-score of interaction terms between relative lipid and protein intake and the phase of the microbiota indicate that the observed association between these macronutrients and growth depends on the composition of the gut microbiota and differs between microbiota phases.the longitudinal patterns of rectal microbiota phase transitions for 95 preterm and 25 full-term subjects are shown in fig.

testing the median dissimilarity revealed that it is significantly higher when the phase changed between consecutive samples than when it remained the same p  0.0001 suggesting discrete periods of community restructuring corresponding to phase transition.we quantified the pattern of progression of the gutmicrobiota with respect to the order of phase transition events using the sequence of phases observed in the consecutive samples from each individual infant to com- pute the transition probabilities between the phases.

for each phase the probability that the subsequent sample from the same individual will be in the same phase is higher than the probability of transitioning to a different phase fig.

overall our results demonstrate that the phase-based model of gut microbiota development in the preterm infant provides a more robust explanation of the data than the period-based model.potential associations of nutrition and medications with phaseafter identifying the microbiota phase as a significant factor in infant growth we sought to identify potential associations of nutrition and medications with phase by including them as explanatory variables and microbiota phases p1 and p2 as the outcome with p3 as the baseline phase in a multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression model.

finally additional metrics of host gut physiology and immune and metabolic development can be incorporated into future studies as they may provide insights into the factors driving phase progression as well as the potential impact of phase transition on the newborn's growth and development.conclusionto our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an association between gut microbiota phase nutritional in- take and growth of preterm infants.

for model a late is consid- ered as the baseline phase coded as 0 and early is coded as 1. for model b phase 3 is considered as the baseline phase coded as 0 phases 1 and 2 are coded as 1 in two separate binary variables.

in our study we introduce two models to identify associations between the microbiota nutritional intake medication and preterm infant growth a categorical model based on three quantitatively defined phases p1 p2 and p3 that corresponds to three states of the microbiota and a pma-based model with the three composition-based phases replaced by two constant time periods identified as early  34 weeks pma n  362 datapoints and late  34 weeks pma n  343 data points.our analyses identified more significant associations with phase which led us to use the phase-based framework to explore potential functional relationships between the pre- term microbiota nutrition and growth.we first defined the phases and phase transition points in longitudinal gut microbiota samples from two cohorts of preterm and full-term infants from the multicenterdevelopment in a cohort of 95 preterm and 2 full-term in- fants from prop and 23 full-term infants from rprc at the university of rochester school of medicine.

finally we demonstrate that transition out of phase 1 p1 occurs simultaneously with transition from meconium to normal postnatal stool a milestone that can be unambiguously identified at the bedside.overall our results illustrate an ecological framework for the preterm infant gut microbiome and represent a significant first step in tailoring nutrient intake accord- ing to microbiota phase.

a complete list of differentially abundant putative functions can be found in additional file table s5.effect of microbiota phase on infant growth nutrient intake and medicationthese observations prompted us to explore the potential relationship between microbiota phase parenteral and enteral nutrient intake medication and infant growth.

antibiotics are positively associated with a p2 gut microbiota significant in the later pma period p  0.0015 and nearly significant in the earlier period p  0.0778. the vari- ables used in these analyses as well as their p values and beta estimates are provided in table a-b and additional file table s8a-b.association between the meconium microbiota and transition out of phase 1in addition to nutrition and other external factors that may influence the phase of the gut microbiome wetable 3 significant results of mixed effects logistic regression for nutrition and medicationaresults of mixed-effects logistic regression analysis between nutritionmedication and microbiome phases during the early period  34 weeks pma.

this model explained approximately half of the variation in the day of life of stool transition from meconium to normal infant stool r-square  0.51. phase transition was found to be highly significant in this model p  0.0001 while gestational age at birth and the intercept did not exhibit significant associations p values  0.35 and 0.23 respect- ively indicating that the time of stool transition was not associated with prematurity or pma once microbiota phase transition was controlled for.

relative to p1 and p3 p2 is associated with lower weight and growth at a given time.significant associations with phase succession were identified with exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics gut motility agents corticosteroids for treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd histamine-2 recep- tor h2-blockers and proton pump inhibitors ppi that reduce gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux  previous studies evaluating use of antibi- otics h2-blockers and ppi in preterm infants identified a relationship between their use and development of necrotizing enterocolitis nec  treatment with h2-blockers has been shown to favor the proliferation of proteobacteria over firmicutes in fecal microbiota which is also associated with development of nec  eleven preterm infants with nec were included in our study but were not analyzed as an independent group and therefore we cannot directly associate phase with changes in microbiota and nec.
