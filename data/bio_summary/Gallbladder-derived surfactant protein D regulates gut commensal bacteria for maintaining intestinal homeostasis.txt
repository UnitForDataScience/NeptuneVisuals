When we examined relative Sftpd gene expression in various organs by quantitative RT-PCR qRT- PCR a notably high expression level of Sftpd mRNA was ob- served in the gallbladder compared with other digestive organs including the stomach intestines appendix liver and pancreas Fig.

Further SP-D protein expression was detected by im- munohistochemical staining in the gallbladder epithelium but not in lamina propria Fig.

As shown in Fig.

Consistent with this bile duct ligation performed to inhibit bile flow into the intestine resulted in a marked reduction in SP-D protein levels in the fecal suspension Fig.

To address this question we first per- formed a comparative microbiome analysis on feces from wild-type WT and Sftpd-- mice.Interestingly significant differences in the bacterial population and diversity were observed between WT and Sftpd-- mice Fig.

1E and Fig.

Since the sequence analysis of 16S ri- bosomal RNA rRNA revealed that most of the altered bacteria species have been poorly characterized these data are presented using operational taxonomic units OTUs Fig.

1F and Fig.

On the other hand commensal fungi which have also been implicated to be bound by SP-D 9 10 were not detected in our specific-pathogen-free SPF mice an obser- vation similarly reported in the SPF mice 11 Fig.

As shown in Fig.
