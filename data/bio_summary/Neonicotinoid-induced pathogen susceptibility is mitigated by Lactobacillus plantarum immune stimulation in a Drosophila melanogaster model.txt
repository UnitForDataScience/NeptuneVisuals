this suggested that imi could be affect- ing the innate immune function of d. melanogaster and thus their ability to regulate microbiota populations.it was found that antibiotic-treated wt flies exposed to lethal concentrations of imidacloprid 100 um had significantly increased overall survival log-rank mantel-cox chi-square  25.54 p  0.0001 and less early time point deaths gehan-breslow-wilcoxon test chi-square  27.09 p  0.0001 in comparison to wt vehicle flies exposed to imidacloprid but not treated with antibiotics supp.

rel-- mutants exposed to 100 um imidacloprid followed a similar trend with antibiotic treated flies having significantly increased overall survival log-rank mantel-cox chi-square  11.75 p  0.0006 and reduced early time point deaths gehan-breslow-wilcoxon test chi-square  10.21 p  0.0014 compared to flies not treated with antibiotics.
