Similarly to taxonomic diversity Mongolian's gut and European's gut show higher diversity than Han Chinese's in functional level Fig.

In addition under the subheading Functional characterization.At the functional level it can be observed the functional structures of intestinal microbiota among Mongolian the Hans and Europeans were significantly different Fig.
