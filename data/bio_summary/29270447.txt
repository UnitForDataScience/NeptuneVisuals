The data represents the combination pooling of the DNA extracted from C. marginella gut from four distant regions of Puerto Rico.structure of the snail Caracolus marginella gut metagenome.

DNA was sent to MR DNA  where the genomic library was generated using Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit Illumina and Qubitr dsDNA HS Assay Kit Life Technologies.

DNA was end-repaired and ligated into a pCCFOS1 fosmid vector then the cloned DNA was transduced into Escherichia coli EPI300.

The data represents the combination of the DNA extracted from C. marginella gut from the four regions of Puerto Rico.Fig.

DNA extraction using Metagenomic DNA Isolation Kit for water Epicentre USA were performed to the membranes following the manufacturer's specifications.
