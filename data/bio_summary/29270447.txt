the data represents the combination pooling of the dna extracted from c. marginella gut from four distant regions of puerto rico.structure of the snail caracolus marginella gut metagenome.

provide and overview of the functional structure of the snail caracolus marginella gut metagenome using subsystem annotation.experimental design materials and methodssample collectionthirty caracolus marginella snails were collected by hand during the years 2013 to 2015. in order to have a representation from different gut microbiomes from c. marginella adapted to different environments of puerto rico five different locations from four regions in the island were established and used as collection sites.

dna was sent to mr dna  where the genomic library was generated using nextera dna sample preparation kit illumina and qubitr dsdna hs assay kit life technologies.

dna was end-repaired and ligated into a pccfos1 fosmid vector then the cloned dna was transduced into escherichia coli epi300.

the taxonomic analysis reveals that bacteria domain was the most abundant 82.15 followed by viruses 16.49 eukaryotes 0.83 archaea 0.31 other sequences 0.13 and unidentified sequences 0.09. the metagenome was constituted of a total of 50 microbial phyla from which the most abundant was proteobacteria 51.47 followed by unclassified derived from virus 16.28 actinobacteria 8.52 bac- teroidetes 3.83 and plactomycetes 3.54. the data represents the combination of the dna extracted from c. marginella gut from the four regions of puerto rico.fig.

dna extraction using metagenomic dna isolation kit for water epicentre usa were performed to the membranes following the manufacturer's specifications.

thirty specimens of c. marginella were collected from the four regions of puerto rico.

high molecular weight 40 kb meta- genomic libraries were generated using a direct dna isolation method.

published by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by license metagenomic examination of a snail gut in puerto rico and will serve as a baseline to start understanding of c. marginella gut microbiome.

in this order metagenomic library was con- structed from c. marginella and shotgun sequencing were performed.
