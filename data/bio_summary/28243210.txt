Therefore clinicians should adopt preemptive approaches striving to avoid or delay the onset of obesity and the metabolic syndrome instead of correcting them post hoc .More studies are needed to assess the efficacy of preventive metabolic interventions including the utilization of availableantiobesity drugs in psychiatric disorders and PTD-induced obesity.

The treatment of obesity and metabolic dysregulations in chronic psychiatric patients is currently underutilized and often initiated late making correction more difficult to achieve.

In this review we take a look beyond psychopharmacological interventions and discuss dietary and physical therapy approaches.Keywords monoamines acetylcholine short-chain fatty acids impulsivity microbiomeiNTRODUCTiONAlthough the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome has been increasing worldwide over the past decades it is significantly higher in mentally ill patients regardless of exposure to psychotropic drugs PTDs -.

As obesity and metabolic dysfunction in psychiatric patients trigger higher morbidity and mortality rates than in the general population there is a heightened urgency for their prevention and early correction.

Preventive use of these agents in psychiatric patients could preempt the development of metabolic dysfunction and obesity.

This recently revealed receptor-receptor interaction may lead to the development of novel compounds for metabolic syndrome and impulsivity  -.Clinicians should be encouraged to prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors in a preventive manner in psychiatric patients sus- ceptible to PTD-induced obesity and dysmetabolism especially in the presence of schizophrenia or dementia-related cognitive impairments.

Interestingly taVNS has documented efficacy in depression which may repre- sent an additional benefit for psychiatric patients .HiSTAMiNeThe relationship between histamine and metabolism was first described in the 1950s yet the development of histaminergic treatments for metabolic disorders and obesity is still in its infancy .
