We decided not to apply any sequence assembly strategy to the reads although this has been found as beneficial for functional annotation efficiency and would have led to a slight increase in peptide identifications data not shown as it would have dramatically reduced the dynamic range of MG counts unless using really com- plex and computationally demanding co-assembly strat- egies Concerning functional annotation we adopted the same strategy recently applied on human and mouse GM datasets upon critical evaluations We acknow- ledge that the global functional annotation yield of MG reads presented here is rather low although the presence of a considerable amount of unknown and poorly anno- tated functions is a known issue in metaproteomics.

Bacterial chaperonin overexpression is hypothe- sized to be required when bacterial communities evolve under a strong genetic drift According to the eco- logical model proposed by Schloissnig and colleagues this is the case of the human gut microbiome where a large selection of bacterial population members is sub- jected to community shifts during the different stage of the individual host life and therefore their extinction might be rescued in the presence of abundant chaperonins 4.Carbohydrate metabolism was proved in earlier works as the most represented COG category in the human gut metaproteome highlighting its functional relevance in the host-microbiota interplay  .

Globally speaking MG data exhibited a larger depth of information compared to MP both in taxonomic and functional terms as expected and previously reported Potential and active functions in the gut microbiotaA preliminary unsupervised multivariate analysis revealed a much clearer separation between MG and MP patterns based on functional data when compared to taxonomic data Additional file Figure S1.

Our data suggest that caution should be used before drawing conclusions on the actual GM functional activity based on metagenomic data and support MP as a valuable approach to investigate the functional role of the GM in health and disease.MethodsSamplesStool samples were collected from 15 healthy Sardinian volunteers 8 females and 7 males from the SardiNIA cohort population.

Although a few pioneering studies have presented the analysis of paired metagenomes and metaproteomes in disease-related human cohorts  a systematic comparative investiga- tion of taxonomic and functional features potentially and actually expressed by the GM of a healthy population has not been described so far.Here we selected a cohort of healthy subjects from a clinically monitored Sardinian population and collected from each subject a stool sample which underwent DNA and protein extraction followed by shotgun MG and MP analyses.

at phylum level r  0.68 - 0.07 at genus level while a considerably lower correlation could be found for functional features r  0.21 - 0.06.We then carried out a comparative investigation of MG and MP features in order to identify GM functions consistently expressed within the healthy human cohort under study taking into account the gene potential of the same GMs.

As a confirmation a higher inter-individual variability concerning the taxonomic composition could be mea- sured in MG compared to MP Wilcoxon signed-rank test with continuity correction two-tailed P  4.7 x 10-8 while the analysis of functional data revealed a higher variability in MP than in MG P  2.2 x 10-16.To further assess which specific GM taxa and func- tions were more conserved and variable within the human cohort under study we also calculated the abun- dance coefficient of variation CV for each taxon and function measured by MG andor MP across the 15 subjects.

Since the very beginning of GM research there was evidence for similarity among indi- viduals in MG functional profiles and metabolic pathway gene modules despite variation in community structure while in a pioneering study VerBerkmoes and coworkers described a more uneven distribution of func- tional categories in the human stool metaproteome com- pared to a non-matched metagenome Similar conclusions were drawn by Franzosa et al.
