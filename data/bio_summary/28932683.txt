Basak et al.reported the soil metagenome from three different locations of the Indian Sunderbans where they have identified the abundance of bac- teroides and acidobacteria whereas in our study we observed the highest abundance of proteobacteria followed by Acidobacteria.

as a measure for es- timating the optimum microbial content for proper sustenance of the fern taxon .

The comparative analyses from the data reveals similar microbial community structure as re- ported in previous metagenomic assemblies from the Sunderbans with the exception in the abundance of Heliobacterium species.

This is the first report of the rhi- zospheric microbiome belonging to a fern species.SpecificationsOrganismcell line tissueRhizospheric metagenome of Acrostichum aureumRhizosphere as a region where various important life processes occur.

In contrast with non-rooted mass soil the soil compartment specifically around plant roots which defines the Rhizosphere is significantly po- pulated by microorganisms .

This work attempts to analyse the rhizospheric abundance of microorganisms around Acrostichum aureum Linn.

This is one of the first studies which reports a fern rhizospheric assemblage of microorganisms.Experimental design materials and methodsRhizospheric soil collection and metagenomic sequencingThe 16s rRNA gene consists of nine hypervariable regions inter- spersed between conserved regions which has been widely used to study and characterize the bacterial community of an environmental sample.

Samples were collected using standard protocols and 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region amplicon sequencing was performed to identify the microbial communities prevalent in the rhi- zosphere.
