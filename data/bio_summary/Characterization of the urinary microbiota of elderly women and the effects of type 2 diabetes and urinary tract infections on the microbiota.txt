totally there were significant differences in the relative abundance of 13 genera between the elderly and non-elderly cohorts table 3. the relative abundance of lactobacillus was significantly lower in the elderly cohort and it was lower in the 81-85 age group compared with the 61-65 group although it was higher in the 71-75 group compared with the 66-70 group figure 3. lactobacillus could not be detected in the samples from three participants in the elderly cohort who were agedover 76. the relative abundance of lactobacillus was not significantly associated with the ph of the elderly women urine r  0.073 p  0.470. interestingly peptococcus was not found in the 61-65 year group although it was present in 20 210 of the samples from the 66-70 group and 33.33 1030 of the samples from the 70 plus group.

due to inter-individual variation the urinary microbiota from the elderly and non-elderly individuals could not be divided into two clusters according to their composition figure 1b and supplementary figure 1. of the 47641 otus from the two cohorts 8876 were shared between the two cohorts figure 1c.the levels of otus and chao1 were slightly decreased in the elderly compared to non-elderly while the values of the shannon and simpson index were slightly higher in the elderly though no significant differences were detected table 2.in addition the bacterial richness and diversity decreased with age in the elderly cohort although no significant differences were detected between the age groups p  0.05 figure 2a and 2b.the richness indices were significantly higher for those in the elderly non-diabetes mellitus endm group compared with those in the elderly diabetes mellitus edm group while the diversity indices were slightly higher for those in the endm group compared with those in the the edm group table 2. both the indices of richness and diversity for the participants inthe elderly with asymtomatic bacteriuria eab group were significantly lower than those for the participants in the elderly non-asymtomatic bacteriuria enab group except for the simpson index table 2.difference in urinary microbiota between the elderly and non-elderly subjectsat the bacterial phylum level the samples from the elderly individuals were dominated by proteobacteria 56.05 firmicutes 19.12 bacteroidetes 14.54actinobacteria 5.99 and thermi 1.05. the samples from the non-elderly individuals were largely characterized by proteobacteria 57.67 firmicutes 20.39 bacteroidetes 9.49 actinobacteria 8.62and acidobacteria 0.95.when the bacterial genus level analyzed we found that the samples from the elderly and non-elderly cohorts contained 373 and 385 genera respectively.

however very few elderly women participated in the study and a larger sample size is needed to make firm conclusions about the urinary microbiota of elderly women 25.the influence of ageing on the microbiota of humans is being increasingly recognized in the medical field 40-43. it is reported that compared with younger adults elderly adults tend to have a reduced diversity of gut microbiota a large inter-individual variability of gut microbiota lower levels of firmicutes bifidobacteria clostridium cluster xiv and faecalibacterium prausnitzii and higher levels of enterobacteriaceae and bacteroidetes 44 45.bacteria living in a host benefit by obtaining nutrition from the host 22. as mentioned previously aging and menopause can lead to the changes to the composition of urine which means that the available nutrition for bacteria in the bladder changes with age.

t2dm is more prevalent in the elderly than in younger individuals 11 for example the prevalence in young adults in china is less than 10 while it is 22.5 in elderly individuals 11. diabetes can lead to changes in the composition of the patient's urine including an increased level of urine glucose ugluand an increased ph 13 which provides a favorable microenvironment for the reproduction of harmful bacteria 14.generally clinicians administer antibiotics for utis according to the results of standard urine cultures sucs 15. however the results of 16s rrna sequencing and the results of expanded quantitative urine cultures have recently shown that suc techniques may not detect the presence of anaerobic fastidious intracellular and slow- growing bacteria 16-21 or bacteria that are embedded within biofilms 22-24. furthermore recent evidence has shown that healthy people have resident microbiota 25-29. therefore when antibiotics are administered for utis on the basis of suc results further microbial dysbiosis in the bladder can occur.previous studies have demonstrated the differences in the urinary microbiota of individuals with urological diseases 25 27-39 such as urgency urinary incontinence uui 28 29 34 37 38 asymptomatic bacteriuria ab in those with neuropathic bladder nb 28 and uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence 32. karsten et al.

elderly t2dm patients were divided into two subgroups fbg  10 mmoll group well controlled group and fbg  10 mmoll group poor controlled group 71 and urine glucose negative and positive group.

urinary tract infections utis is one of the most commonly reported infections in elder adults 2. several urinary defense mechanisms exist to combat uropathogens such as low ph extremes of osmolality and high concentrations of organic acids can become impaired with age 3. thuselderly women are more utisthan younger women 3. in addition menopause may be a risk factor for utis 4. the level of free glycogen in post-menopausal women is lower than that in pre-menopausal women 5 and levels of free glycogen are associated with a vaginal microbiota that is dominated by lactobacillus 6 and a low vaginal ph 7 which are both protective against uropathogens 6 8.the number of elderly individuals with diabetes is growing substantially 9 and over 90 of patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm 10. t2dm is not due to insufficient use of insulin but due to insufficient insulin secretion and insufficient insulin action.

the relative abundance of lactobacillus iners was much greater in the edm group compared with the endm group 0.05- 0.01 vs. 0.00 - 0.00 p  0.036. however it was not associated with fbg levels r  -0.198 p  0.354 and there was no significant difference between the uglu positive and uglu negative samples 0.00 - 0.00 vs. 0.06 - 0.02 p  0.273.elderly urinary microbiota associated with abthose in the eab group had significantly lower levels of firmicutes and significantly higher levels of fusobacteria than those in the enab group data not shown.

previous studies demonstrated that intestinal microbiota composition differed markedly according to dietary intake 46 and diet could induce differences in microbitoa composition and microbial metabolites including volatile fatty acids secondary bile acids and products of protein degradation 47. thus urinary microbiota might be indirectly influenced by intestinal microbiota alterations caused by dietary pattern that is the composition of urine is influenced by nutrient metabolism 48.a previous study has demonstrated that theabundance of proteobacteria was significantly higherin patients with utis than in controls 39 while the levels of proteobacteria tended to be lower in the elderly compared with the non-elderly in our study.

subsequently we isolated the dna using a magnetic beads-based dna extraction method with minor modifications 66 which included adding lysis buffer.the major limitation of this study was the participants' urine samples were not all collected at an identical room temperature during the same season so the temperature-related differences in the rates of bacterial reproduction 67 during the process of urine collection may have influenced the urinary microbiota.to our knowledge this is the first study to characterize the urinary microbiota of elderly women.

coli is the most common urinary tract pathogen and it is responsible for 76.6 of utis in elderly women 54. however the abundance of e. coli was the same in the elderly and non-elderly cohorts and it was not affected by uti events.edm appeared to lower the bacterial richness and diversity which was similar to the findings of previous studies 55. it is unclear why the edm group had a lower relative abundance of nitrospirae compared with the endm group given that a previous study only found nitrospirae in patients with interstitial cystitis 30. these results suggest that alterations in urinary microbiota are related to certain health conditions.

moreover the relative abundance of eggerthella was greater in the edm group than in the endm group and a study of chinese patients reported that intestinal eggerthella was linked with t2dm 58. the abundance of fusobacterium was lower in the edm group although it has previously been shown to increase in patients with uui 37. a lower abundance of klebsiella was also associated with edm which is in line with the findings from a previous study that showed that klebsiella is a uropathogen found in patients with diabetes 59. notably l. iners which is strongly associated with bacterial vaginosis 60 predominated in the edm group.

p  0.05 was considered statistically significant.uti events r  0.43 p  0.765 but it increased with water intake r  0.412 p  0.003.bmi correlated to elderly urinary microbiotain the elderly cohort the relative abundance of firmicutes increased with bmi from those with normal weight 18.5  bmi  23 to those who were overweight 23  bmi  25 to those who were obese bmi  25 58 0.15 - 0.15 vs. 0.18 - 0.19 vs. 0.42 - 0.16 p  0.002.discussionthe urinary microbiota of elderly women showed similar inter-individual variation to that of the non-elderly individuals suggesting that other factors affect microbiota besides age.

the urinary microbiota of women is affected by ageing type 2 diabetes mellitus and asymtomatic bacteriuria.introductionthe number of people in the world aged 60 or over is projected to grow by 56 1. the sex ratio in 2015 among those aged 60 or over was 86 men per 100 women 1. elder individuals are more susceptible to infectionsbecause their immune system are weaker.

the diversity and composition of the microbiota of elderly women is different from those of non-elderly women and the differences are linked to the participant's characteristics.
