The relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly lower in the elderly cohort and it was lower in the 81-85 age group compared with the 61-65 group although it was higher in the 71-75 group compared with the 66-70 group Figure 3.

Elderly T2DM patients were divided into two subgroups FBG  10 mmolL group well controlled group and FBG  10 mmolL group poor controlled group 71 and urine glucose negative and positive group.

However very few elderly women participated in the study and a larger sample size is needed to make firm conclusions about the urinary microbiota of elderly women 25.The influence of ageing on the microbiota of humans is being increasingly recognized in the medical field 40-43.

The level of free glycogen in post-menopausal women is lower than that in pre-menopausal women 5 and levels of free glycogen are associated with a vaginal microbiota that is dominated by Lactobacillus 6 and a low vaginal pH 7 which are both protective against uropathogens 6 8.The number of elderly individuals with diabetes is growing substantially 9 and over 90 of patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM 10.

The diversity and composition of the microbiota of elderly women is different from those of non-elderly women and the differences are linked to the participant's characteristics.

Of the 47641 OTUs from the two cohorts 8876 were shared between the two cohorts Figure 1C.The levels of OTUs and Chao1 were slightly decreased in the elderly compared to non-elderly while the values of the Shannon and Simpson index were slightly higher in the elderly though no significant differences were detected Table 2.In addition the bacterial richness and diversity decreased with age in the elderly cohort although no significant differences were detected between the age groups P  0.05 Figure 2A and 2B.The richness indices were significantly higher for those in the elderly non-diabetes mellitus ENDM group compared with those in the elderly diabetes mellitus EDM group while the diversity indices were slightly higher for those in the ENDM group compared with those in the the EDM group Table 2.

P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.UTI events r  0.43 P  0.765 but it increased with water intake r  0.412 P  0.003.BMI correlated to elderly urinary microbiotaIn the elderly cohort the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased with BMI from those with normal weight 18.5  BMI  23 to those who were overweight 23  BMI  25 to those who were obese BMI  25 58 0.15 - 0.15 vs. 0.18 - 0.19 vs. 0.42 - 0.16 P  0.002.DISCUSSIONThe urinary microbiota of elderly women showed similar inter-individual variation to that of the non-elderly individuals suggesting that other factors affect microbiota besides age.

The urinary microbiota of women is affected by ageing type 2 diabetes mellitus and asymtomatic bacteriuria.INTRODUCTIONThe number of people in the world aged 60 or over is projected to grow by 56 1.

Both the indices of richness and diversity for the participants inthe elderly with asymtomatic bacteriuria EAB group were significantly lower than those for the participants in the elderly non-asymtomatic bacteriuria ENAB group except for the Simpson index Table 2.Difference in urinary microbiota between the elderly and non-elderly subjectsAt the bacterial phylum level the samples from the elderly individuals were dominated by Proteobacteria 56.05 Firmicutes 19.12 Bacteroidetes 14.54Actinobacteria 5.99 and Thermi 1.05.
