The isolates were obtained from clinical cases of disease in Ireland between 2013 and 2015 and were submitted to the National Salmonella Shigella and Listeria human health Reference Laboratory service at Galway University Hospital.Whole-genomic DNA was extracted using the GenElute bacterial genomic DNA kit Sigma Aldrich per the manufacturer's instructions.

Library preparation and 250-bp paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform Mi- crobes NG University of Birmingham UK.

Raw reads were mapped to a reference genome using BWA-mem and de novo assembly was performed using SPAdes genome assembler.

Contigs were reordered using Mauve aligner v2.4.0.

Prediction of putative open reading frames ORFs was performed using PRODIGAL prediction software  and supported by BLASTx  alignments.

rRNA and tRNA genes were detected using RNAMMER  and tRNA-scanSE  re- spectively.
