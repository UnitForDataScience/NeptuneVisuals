It is a biphasic variant of gene therapy in which a bacterium armed with an enzyme that can convert an inert prodrug into a cy- totoxic compound induces tumour cell death following tumour-specific prodrug activation.

Finally we discuss clinical and regulatory barriers facing BDEPT and propose prom- ising approaches through which these hurdles may best be tackled.c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This promoter can be either a constituent of the carrier's genome or part of the tumour cell's default machinery.The union of bacteria and GDEPT yields bacterial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy BDEPT also referred to as bacterial prodrug therapy which constitutes a two-step procedure for treating cancer using bacte- ria as in situ sources of prodrug-converting enzymes .

If prodrug metabolism is to occur within the tumour cell the bacterium will require intracellular ac- cess to supply its enzyme but the requirement is waived if the drug can enter the cancer cell following activation.

Furthermore an API which relies on direct engagement with intracellular tumour elements to function must be present within a tumour cell for its mechanism of action to take hold.

L. monocytogenes-mediated bactofection has delivered PNP into several tumour cell lines allowing efficient cytotoxicity  while attenuated Salmonella has been employed to deliver TK to experimental B16 melanoma cells in vivo in which following GCV administration significant suppression of tumour growth was observed .Anticancer therapies which rely on intracellular agents to deliver genes to tumours generally fall drastically short of depositing their pay- load in the entirety of the malignancy .

The identification of auxotrophic VNP20009 mutants and more efficient CD variants referenced above are clear attempts to im- prove tumour colonisation and tumour growth inhibition while reduc- ing the bacterial burden on the patients to whom the therapy is administered.Recently a transformed strain of B. longum APS001F containing a point mutation in its CD gene was described as having 10-fold greater enzymatic activity in vitro than its wildtype counterpart .

The two-step procedure of BDEPT is illustrated wherein bacteria expressing a prodrug-converting enzyme are administered to an oncology patient step 1 followed by systemic administration of a corresponding prodrug when the tumour is adequately colonised step 2.

The availability of a high-calibre facility for monitoring the progress of a medical intervention is correlated with an accelerated bench-to-bedside timeframe  so it is worthwhile reflecting on how BDEPT can be satisfactorily monitored to mobilise its translation into the clinic.For the BDEPT designer real-time monitoring of the impact of the bacterial carrier and prodrug administration on tumour regression is an invaluable way of evaluating responsiveness to a medical interven- tion.

The in situ bacterial-mediated conversion of 5-fluorocytosine a prodrug to 5-fluorouracil an API is illustrated in step 2.logistically leads to the tumour-specific activation of an administered prodrug.
