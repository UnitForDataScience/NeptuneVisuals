the two-step procedure of bdept is illustrated wherein bacteria expressing a prodrug-converting enzyme are administered to an oncology patient step 1 followed by systemic administration of a corresponding prodrug when the tumour is adequately colonised step 2. the in situ bacterial-mediated conversion of 5-fluorocytosine a prodrug to 5-fluorouracil an api is illustrated in step 2.logistically leads to the tumour-specific activation of an administered prodrug.

it is a biphasic variant of gene therapy in which a bacterium armed with an enzyme that can convert an inert prodrug into a cy- totoxic compound induces tumour cell death following tumour-specific prodrug activation.

this promoter can be either a constituent of the carrier's genome or part of the tumour cell's default machinery.the union of bacteria and gdept yields bacterial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy bdept also referred to as bacterial prodrug therapy which constitutes a two-step procedure for treating cancer using bacte- ria as in situ sources of prodrug-converting enzymes .

if prodrug metabolism is to occur within the tumour cell the bacterium will require intracellular ac- cess to supply its enzyme but the requirement is waived if the drug can enter the cancer cell following activation.

additional cell lysis occurred due to heightened expression of the lysin itself.in bdept bactofection can be applied if the api has difficulty cross- ing cell membranes if the enzyme cannot be expressed inside bacterial cells optimally or in a 'host cell conditional' strategy involving expres- sion of genes from a mammalian promoter.

contrastingly a prodrug which is activated by an exogenous enzyme gives the clinician signifi- cant control regarding the calibration of the patient's treatment allowing them to time the site-specific initiation of therapy if the en- zyme is guided to the tumour appropriately.the bacterial biofactory bacteria as enzyme delivery vehiclesbacteria have many characteristics which favour them as tumour- targeting agents over other transduction and transfection methodologies.

it is vital at this point for the designer to understand both the toxicity and membrane permeability of their compound because this will clarify whether re-cal- ibration of the enzyme will be truly beneficial to bdept efficacy.design principle v choosing a bacterial carrierat this stage having defined the pharmacological and toxicological traits of both drug and prodrug and having gained an appreciation of the biochemistry of their chosen enzyme the designer should be able to deliberate on an appropriate bacterial carrier.

however a bacterium expressing a cytoplasmic prodrug-modifying enzyme can activate a prodrug only if both are simultaneously present in the bacterial cell.

b-g has been directed to the outer membrane of e. coli bl21 by fusing it with an autotransporter protein demonstrating activation of the p-hy- droxy aniline mustard b-d-glucuronide and inducing toxicity in exper- imental human colon cancer cells .augmenting an enzyme's exposure to the prodrug by relocating itcloser to the cell surface could possibly impact the stability of the en- zyme itself.

while it is a feasible tactic for enriching the activation of a hy- drophilic prodrug re-orientation of an enzyme such that it is closer to the surface of the bacterial cell can also be applied to circumvent toxicologi- cal threats to bacteria.

this problem can be negotiated by tethering the enzyme to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria or the outer membrane of gram-negative bac- teria using leader peptides and transmembrane sequence systems  or by re-routing it to the periplasm - a protein-rich boundary found in the bacterial cell wall .

our laboratory has successfully employed the prodrug fludarabine in conjunction with the endogenous activity of e. coli nissle 1917 to induce cancer cell death in multiple cell lines .

the enzyme has been experimentally expressed in escherichia coli dh5a cells with results indicating inferior activation of irinotecan a topoisomerase in- hibitor by the bacterial carrier compared with an adenoviral carrier ex- pressing the same enzyme .
