Although skin flora varies based on skin site diet age and gender the most commonly detected normal skin flora include Propionibacterium acnes S epidermidis and Cornyebacterium.Skin flora are also found within multiple layers of the skin suggesting that commensal bacteria may play a greater role in immune modulation than previously thought.Maintenance of the skin microbiome has been linked to S epidermidis which interacts with the innate immune system through activation of TLR-2.

In addition these commensal bacteria S epidermidis and P acnes in partic- ular produce proteins that inhibit the growth of S aureus.Thus the maintenance of the skin microbiome requires the growth of normal skin flora which modulates im- mune activity without initiating a state of chronic inflammation and prevents growth of pathogenic bacteria.Alterations in the skin barrier function and pH as well as suppression of innate im- munity by the inflammatory milieu in the skin renders the skin prone to colonization by S aureus.

Eo eosinophil NMF natural moisturizing factor.Skin Barrier DefectsThe outermost layer of the epidermis the stratum corneum SC a cornified squamous epithelium that prevents water loss and guards against entry of foreign substances is defective in AD.A bricks and mortar structure the SC is composed of dead SC cells held by a mortar of cornified cell envelope comprised of a proteinlipid polymer just beneath the cytoplasmic surface of the cells.Defects in the layer are associated with AD skin in AD patients has significantly thinner SC than healthy controls and transepidermal water loss studies demonstrate increased water loss in affected sites--a hallmark of AD--with increasing transepidermal water loss correlating with increasing AD severity.This skin barrier defect has been linked to mutations in filaggrin gene FLG.Meta- analyses of studies evaluating the association between FLG mutations and AD found an odds ratio OR of 4.78.This association is likely due to the important role of filag- grin in interacting with the keratin cytoskeleton to excrete lipid lamellae to form the cornified envelope comprising the mortar structure of the SC.Impaired excretion of the envelope results in compromise of the skin barrier.

In AD lesions plasmacytoid DCs which produce interferon IFN-a crucial in fighting viral infections are absent whereas myeloid DCs--Langerhans cells LCs and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells IDECs--predominate.In atopic skin LCs are in the upper layers of the epidermis and penetrate tight junctions to cap- ture outside antigens.Both LC and IDEC overexpress FceR1 the high-affinity recep- tor for IgE.Allergen challenge during atopy patch test results in infiltration of LCs and up-regulation of FceR1.Binding of IgE on LCs results in the production of IL-16 which attracts CD41 T cells and also aids in TH2 polarization.The TH2 response is characterized by production of IL-4 IL-5 IL-10 and IL-13 which contribute to the inflammation and severity of AD.IL-4 IL-13 and more recently TSLP have been shown to affect keratinocytes by reducing the production of AMP.TH2 cytokine- suppression of the AMP human b-defensin 2 hBD-2 has been observed in multiple studies.Suppression of inflammation may represent a host mechanism in limiting harmful inflammation and protecting the host from collateral damage.This concept in AD is supported by a more recent study which showed a significant increased num- ber of myeloid-derived suppressor cells MDSCs in AD skin compared with healthy skin.Activation of Toll-like receptor 2 TLR-2 by S aureus leads to production of IL-6 which induces MDSCs culminating in the suppression of inflammation created by excessive cutaneous immunity.TSLP also enhances the TH2 response from DCs via regulation of the production of TH2-cell-attracting thymus and activation- regulated chemokine TARCCCL17.Mast cells may also release IL-31 to promotethe TH2 inflammatory response.IL-25 activates TH2 memory cells with TSLP- activated DCs.A small number of TH17 cells have been found in AD skin.

In AD patients Uste- kinumab a monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-12IL-23 signaling and regulates IL-17 was not found effective suggesting that IL-17 may be a bystander of the inflammatory state rather than a key instigator of AD inflammation.In addition the number of TH17 cells is relatively low in AD lesions compared with other inflammatory skin dis- eases including Sjo gren syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis vlu- garis.These cells are crucial in mucosal immunity and a low number of them in AD compared with that in psoriasis is consistent with increased skin infections in AD.Although the initial recruitment of T cells to atopic lesions may result in a TH2 response the later phase of inflammation yields an increase in IFN-g IL-12 and GM-CSF which characterize the TH1 and TH0 response.Persistent chronic inflam- mation results in recruitment of T cells into the skin via chemokines that sustain a com- bined TH2 TH1 TH0 and TH22 inflammatory response.IL-22 produced by TH22 and CD81 T cells is an important cytokine in the pathogenesis of adult AD.This cytokine causes epidermal hyperplasia.

Its expression has been found to be similar or higher in AD lesions compared with that in psoriatic lesions.Regulatory T cells CD251 FOXP31 are found increased in the circulation of AD pa- tients but are not found in the skin lesions.Further studies are needed to deter- mine the role of these cells in AD.Skin MicrobiomeThe normal skin microbiome is modulated by skin pH moisture and keratinocytes.

In AD patients with increased S aureus colonization S epidermidis colonization was also found increased.Because S epidermidis is a commensal skin flora and may prevent S aureus colonization it is unclear if this increase is simply a response to increased S aureus colonization or if the strain of S epidermidis in AD is different from healthy individuals.BACTERIAL INFECTIONStaphylococcus aureusThe colonization of AD skin with S aureus contributes to its being the most common skin infection in AD.

In individuals with AD the infection can be more severe and widespread with up to hundreds of papules and is known as eczema molluscatum.MCV tends to infect inflamed skin but can spread to nonlesional skin via autoinoculation.Most lesions resolve spontaneously and there are no systemic symptoms although many lesions resolve quicker with treatment.MCV produces soluble IL-18 binding protein that inhibits IL-18 which stimulates production of IFN-g.This may to inhibit the immune response and pre- vent natural killer cell and T-cell activation both of which are notably absent at the base of MCV papules.The down-regulation of normal antiviral responses in AD may lead to more widespread MCV infection in these individuals.MANAGEMENTPrevention of the infectious complications of AD should focus on controlling AD flares and establishment of a routine of maintenance skin care .

The interaction be- tween the immune system environment and skin barrier defects initiates an inflam- matory cycle that alters the skin's innate immunity and microbiome  leading to infectious complications.Disclosure Dr P.Y.

Filaggrin also helps maintain cell-to-cell integrity those with FLG defects have decreased tight junctions and cor- neodesmosin density--proteins needed to main connections between cells.The filaggrin breakdown products pyrrolidone carboxylic acid and urocanic acid are also natural moisturizing factors that maintain skin moisture and acidify skin-surface pH which prevent activation of serine proteases and kallikrein.Defects in FLG thus result in dry skin and activation of these downstream enzymes that inhibit lamellar excretion via activation of protease-activated receptor type 2 degrade tight junctions and corneodesmosomes and down-regulate ceramide synthesis.The rise in pH also promotes proliferation and adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus.Moreover acti- vation of kallikrein produces the pro-helper T-cell TH TH2 response without allergen priming thereby interacting with the immune system to promote an inflammatory response.Despite the association of FLG mutations with AD many individuals with AD do not carry FLG mutations and 40 of individuals with FLG null mutations do not have AD.
