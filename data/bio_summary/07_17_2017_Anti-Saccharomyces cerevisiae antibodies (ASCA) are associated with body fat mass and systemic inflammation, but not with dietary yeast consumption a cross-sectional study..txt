the scientific lit- erature does however not support a relationship between bread consumption and obesity although consumption of white bread as opposed to whole grain bread might be associated with excess abdominal fat and impaired weight loss to our knowledge an association be- tween asca and yeast-containing food in relation to obesity remains to be explored.saccharomyces cerevisiae also has the ability to grow at body temperature and to respond to the gut environ- ment suggesting that it may play a role in gut microbial ecology a growing body of evidence suggests that deviations in the gut microbiota and increased intestinal permeability are associated with obesity and the meta- bolic inflammation that may accompany excess adiposity a recent recognition is that specific anti-microbial antibodies may as well be raised in obesity and associ- ated co-morbidities such as diabetes and glucose in- tolerance increased gut permeability with the potential translocation of saccharomyces cerevisiae or related luminal antigens could thus be another cause of elevated asca concentrations in obesity.the aims of the present paper were to study asca in subjects with morbid obesity in a larger study than the previously published study by salamati et al.

and to study associations between asca and dietary intake obesity-related co-morbidities and biomarkers of inflam- mation and gut permeability.methodsthe present study used data from a cross-sectional study at innlandet hospital trust gjovik norway.

a study which reported associations between nutrients and the presence of fungal populations in fecal samples did how- ever not find any relationship between saccharomyces and the nutrient composition of the diet either recent or long term diet in the present study there were no associations between asca igg and either energy yielding nutrients or total energy intake.in addition to the association between asca igg and body fat mass our study showed an association between asca igg positivity and serum crp.

the finding of a borderline association between asca igg and intestinal permeability also needs further elucidation.abbreviationsasca anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies crp c-reactive protein ffq food frequency questionnaire hscl-10 hopkins symptom checklist 10acknowledgementswe are grateful for the assistance of anja byfuglien study nurse at innlandet hospital trust gjovik in patient inclusion study co-ordination and biobank organization.fundingthe study has received funding from innlandet hospital trust brumunddal norway.availability of data and materialscase report forms on paper were used for collection of the clinical data and are all safely stored.

a study of patients with crohn's disease also showed a non-significant trend between ele- vated asca igg and intestinal permeability but similar to our study could not demonstrate a clear cut association .

these aspects were not explored in the present study but could be directions for future research.strenghts and limitationsstrength of the study is that it was based on a well characterized population with the assessment of a wide range of demographic clinical and biochemical data thereby reducing the risk of unknown confounders.

in a study from 2015 salamati et al.

investigated associations between anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies asca igg and iga and obesity in this study asca levels were higher in morbidly obese than in normal weight subjects and there was a correlation between asca and bmi the cause of the elevated asca levels is however not clear.saccharomyces cerevisiae is among the most com- monly detected fungi in human fecal samples and it pre- sumably originates from food in human diet bread is one of the main dietary sources of this yeast baker's yeast along with beer brewer's yeast.

the patients had not started the weight redu- cing intervention at the time of study inclusion.

the study used a large range of questionnaire data collected at the time of inclusion with a case report form and a food frequency questionnaire ffq.

in particular no associations were found between asca igg and yeast-containing food energy- yielding nutrients or total energy intake table table 1 demographical and clinical data for the study population aall patients n  140 bage years43.1 8.7gender malefemale31 22109 78ethnic nordic background138 99height cm169 149-197weight kg120 90-192bmi kgm241.6 35-55body fat percentage of body weight46.8 31-51 body fat mass kg54.1 39-81smoking neverformercurrent55 3960 4325 18 previous or present co-morbidityigg-positive compared to the igg-negative subjects.
