When we compared early versus late second trime- ster group samples there was no difference in microbiota evenness J' 14 0.83 - 0.012 vs. 0.80 - 0.021 p 14 0.20 rich-ness S 14 5 - 0.33 vs. 5.63 - 0.36 p 14 0.17 or diversity H' 14 1.32 - 0.05 vs. 1.35 - 0.05 p 14 0.38 at the phylum level.

At the phylum level there was no difference in overall richness at baseline compared with follow-up d 14 2.07 - 0.09 vs. 1.94 - 0.07 p 14 0.27 while evenness J 14 0.66 - 0.04 vs. 0.79 - 0.02 p 14 0.01 anddiversity H 14 1.12 - 0.05 vs. 1.34 - 0.03 p 14 0.002 increased from baseline to follow-up.

When we compared microbiota characteristics by maternal race we found that compared with non-White womenTable 1 Total women enrolled and study samples available for analysisTable 2 Phylum-level bacterial abundance by maternal race from phase 1 n 14 16aAdjusted for multiple correction testing.White women had greater richness N 14 7.1 - 0.25 vs. 2.34 - 0.46 p 14 0.007 and diversity H' 14 0.85 - 0.03vs.

There was also moderate correlation between infant birth weight and Proteobacteria abundance correlation coefficientr 14 0.4 p 14 0.04 and a strong negative correlation with the bacteria intheother category r 14 - 0.6 p 14 0.001 Fig.

In phase 2 we excluded women from the analysis for whom we did not obtain a follow-up sample because they delivered preterm prior to sample collection n 14 7 had a second trimester miscarriage n 14 1 or transferred to an- other facility n 14 2.

0.33 - 0.06 p 14 0.01 but not evenness J' 14 0.57 - 0.02 vs. 0.28 - 0.02 p 14 0.09 at the phylum level.

White women had significantly higher abundance of Firmicutes 23 - 0.15 vs. 16 - 0.75 p 14 0.007 and Bacteroidetes 24 - 0.14 vs. 19 - 0.68 p 14 0.02 and lower abundance of Synergistetes 5.6 -0.42 vs. 6.7 - 1.10 p 14 0.02 compared with non-White women Table 2.In phase 2 18 women self-identified as White 58 8 as African-American 26 and 5 as Hispanic 16.

While not statistically significant obese women had a markedly decreased abundance of Fuso- bacteria baseline 4.6 - 0.42 vs. 0.03 - 0.002 p 14 0.32 fol-low-up 7.1 - 0.8 vs. 0.72 - 0.06 p 14 0.38.Infant Birth WeightWe assessed results for all samples n 14 28 from singleton pregnancies to evaluate the relationship between mother's microbiome and infant birth weight.

There was no difference in the overall abundance of Bacteroidetes 21 - 0.19 vs. 22 - 0.25 p 14 0.9 or Firmicutes 20 - 0.21 vs. 21 - 0.32 p 14 0.45.
