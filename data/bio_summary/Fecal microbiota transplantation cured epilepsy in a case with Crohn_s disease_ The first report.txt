This interesting finding might open a new window into disease mechanism focusing on the microbiotagut brain axis and inspire a novel treatment for epilepsy through remodeling of the gut microbiota.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe wish to express our appreciation to Tabak Fatema Department of Digestive Endoscopy the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University for kindly editing the manuscript and giving professional suggestions.Case characteristicsA Chinese girl with long-term epilepsy was referred to our hospital because of unsuccessful treatment for Crohn's disease CD.Clinical diagnosisClinical symptoms showed chronic diarrhea growth retardation mild malnutrition and menstrual cycle disorder.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis included intestinal tuberculosis and viral infection.Laboratory diagnosisLaboratory evaluation revealed low hemoglobin and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.Imaging diagnosisMagnetic resonance imaging confirmed the severe strictures in sigmoid colon and anus with perianal fistula and negative finding in brain.Pathological diagnosisThe patient was diagnosed definitely with no pathological examination althoughthis was important.TreatmentThe patient underwent three fecal microbiota transplantations and twoendoscopic balloon procedures during the 12 mo after her first visit.Related reportsThere is no report on fecal microbiota transplantation for epilepsy.Term explanationFecal microbiota transplantation involves infusing healthy donor microbiota into the intestines of a patient to restore the intestinal microbiota.Experiences and lessonsThis case highlights the disease mechanism focusing on the microbiota- gut-brain axis and possibly inspiring a novel treatment for epilepsy through remodeling of the gut microbiota.Peer-reviewThe paper is well written.

Despite the development of surgical procedures epilepsy surgery is still done in a small subset of drugresistant epilepsy cases.

However the present patient in this report was diagnosed as epilepsy at the age of 13 and only had mild malnutrition.Although it has been mentioned that FMT might be helpful for certain neurological diseases6 and CD7 as far as we know this article is the first report of successful epilepsy treatment using FMT.

Here to the best of our knowledge we report the first case that used FMT to achieve remission of intestinal and neurological symptoms in a girl with CD and a 17-year history of epilepsy.

Furthermore this finding highlights the role of microbiota-gut-brain axis and inspires a novel treatment for epilepsy through remodeling gut microbiota.Key words Fecal microbiota transplantation Epilepsy Crohn's disease Gut microbiota Brain-gut axisc The Authors 2017.

Fecal microbiota transplantation cured epilepsy in a case with Crohn' s disease The first report.

Based on our initial expectation on the role of FMT in epilepsy we decided to stop sodium valproate after the first FMT and getting her informedConsiderable evidence has shown the effects of microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders1.

In this study we report the first case that used FMT as a treatment of tongterm epilepsy in a patient with Crohn's disease CD.

Since then the patient never had recurrence of epilepsy during the entire 20 mo of followup and has remained in seizurefree without antiepileptic drugs up to the date of this submission.
