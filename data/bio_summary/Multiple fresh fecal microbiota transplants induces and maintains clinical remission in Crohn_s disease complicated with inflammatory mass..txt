Twenty-one of the 25 patients received the image review 9.5 221 patients achieved radiological healing 71.4 1521 patients achieved radiological improvement 9.5 221 patients achieved no radiological change and 9.5 221 patients got radiological worsening.

120 patients 82.8 were excluded from analysis including 114 patients not meeting the inclusion criteria on MRI or CT scan one for the uncertain clinical response to anti-TNF therapy three months before FMT and five patients with less than 12 months fol- low-up.

Exclusion criteria included 1 patients accompanied with serious diseases including other intestinal diseases e. g. C. difficile infection cancers organ failure heart diseases 2 patients with refractory obstruction symptoms after conservative treatment3 patients who received biological therapies such as infliximab had uncertain clinical response three months before FMT.Donor selection.

These results indicated that gut microbiota may be a therapeutic target for treatment of CD-associated inflammatory masses.In this study the initial FMT induced clinical remission in 52.0 patients and clinical improvement in 68 patients at three months.

With the continued FMT every 3 months 47.8 to 52.0 patients had clinical remission and 56.0 to 68.0 patients had clinical improvement respectively during the follow up 3-15 months.

The remission included patients with sustained clinical remission and patients with relapseflare but induced to remission by FMT.

68.0 1725 and 52.0 1325 of patients achieved clinical response and clinical remission at 3 monthspost the initial FMT respectively.

Nine patients rapidly achieved clinical remission within one week and 13 had clinical remission within one month.

In the present study 60 610 of steroid dependent patients achieved steroid-free clinical improvement including 20 210 who achieved steroid-free clinical remission.

Suskind et al.reported that 77.8 of patients with CD achieved clinical remission two weeks after FMT and our previous reportsshowed clinical remission rate of 76.7 at 1 month.
