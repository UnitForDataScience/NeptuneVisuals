the primary endpoint was clinical responseimprovement and remission and sustained clinical remission at 12 months.

68.0 1725 and 52.0 1325 of patients achieved clinical response and clinical remission at 3 monthspost the initial fmt respectively.

the response included clinical remission and clinical improvement.

a the hbi score at baseline and one month after the initial fmt n  25. nine patients rapidly achieved clinical remission within one week and 13 had clinical remission within one month.

these results indicated that gut microbiota may be a therapeutic target for treatment of cd-associated inflammatory masses.in this study the initial fmt induced clinical remission in 52.0 patients and clinical improvement in 68 patients at three months.

with the continued fmt every 3 months 47.8 to 52.0 patients had clinical remission and 56.0 to 68.0 patients had clinical improvement respectively during the follow up 3-15 months.

in the present study 60 610 of steroid dependent patients achieved steroid-free clinical improvement including 20 210 who achieved steroid-free clinical remission.

suskind et al.reported that 77.8 of patients with cd achieved clinical remission two weeks after fmt and our previous reportsshowed clinical remission rate of 76.7 at 1 month.

these factors might partially contribute to the decreased rate of clinical remission and clinical improvement at 18 months.

the primary endpoint was clinical response improvement and remission and sustained clinical remission at 12 months.
