Because the three different lineages of P. australis are widespread and grow sympatrically across North America this species provides a unique opportunity to study the similaritiesand differences in the rhizosphere bacterial communities both among plant lineages with known phylogenies and across a wide range of geographical distances.Here we investigated whether there were distinct rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with different P. australis lineages in both a field survey and common garden experiment.

Numerous studies have documented the importance of local environmental features in structuring soil microbial communities  - thus the divergence in bacterial communities between sympatriclineages growing in the same system suggests that lineage over- whelms local environmental conditions in determining rhizo- sphere bacterial community structure--results we were able to confirm with a common garden experiment.Differences between Native and Introduced P. australis have been observed in associated oomycete and archaeal commu- nities.

2 PERMANOVA F275  8.13 p  0.001 indicating that lineage may be a sufficiently strong determinant of bacterial community structure that it overwhelms local environmental conditions even among the active commu- nity which would be more likely to respond to local environ- mental variation.The rhizosphere bacterial communities within the Gulf and Native lineages demonstrated stronger within-lineage similarity than the Introduced lineage Fig.

At three locations Block Island RI Great Bay NH and Falmouth MA we collected rhizosphere soil samples from co- occurring Native and Introduced P. australis populations allowing us to more closely examine the relative strength of both lineage and geographic proximity in structuring rhizosphere bacterial communities.

These consistent differences between Native and Intro- duced lineages across multiple microbial domains support the view that lineage exerts a dominant control on soil rhizosphere communities one that may promote invasion success through plant-soil feedbacks spillover and soil legacies.

Since soil microbes are typically controlled bylocal edaphic characteristics- homogeneity of rhizospherebacteria within P. australis lineages across the sampling range along with heterogeneity among lineages in our field experiment would be consistent with our hypothesis that lineage-specific forcing is structuring rhizosphere bacterial communities.

The greater change in bacterial turnover with distance in the Introduced lineage compared to the other lineages suggests that Introduced populations have a greater reliance on novel associations in soils from the introduced range that are derived from the pool of local microflora a pool thatwould be expected to decrease in similarity with distance from the source population.Our results support that the P. australis lineage played a critical role in structuring bacterial communities across large spatial scales.

Colored bars indicate the taxon was present in 100 of the samples for that lineage whereas gray bars indicate that it was only present in some samplesexperiment indicate that the rhizosphere bacterial community is structured by plant lineage with the Introduced lineage demon- strating evidence of decreased enemy attack compared to the Gulf and Native lineages.ResultsOverview of experiments.

Rather while P. australis lineage shaped the bacterial community its activity and belowground soil proper- ties the influence of lineage on aboveground and belowground biomass was solely via direct effects.

The higher belowground biomass of the Introduced P. australis lineage compared to the Native lineage and to other native wetland plants it displaces suggests that invasion-induced changes in microbial community could be widespread though further work is needed to determine how far into the bulk soil these changes propagate.
