the abundance of anaerobes was similar across mild dfis abundance  29.5 -31 moderate dfis abundance 20.5 -22.3 and severe dfis abundance  27.3 -21 indicat- ing there exist no differences between patients presenting with more severe infections and a greater abundance of anaerobes p  0.6.neuropathic and neuroischaemic diabetic foot ulcers harbor similar microbiomestwenty-three patients were classified as having neuropathic dfus normal tbi ranges  0.9-b1.2 and mnds  6 and sixteen patients were classified as having neuroischaemic dfus tbi b 0.7 to 0.3 and mnds  6. non-parametric approaches identified no difference in the mean average abundances between neuropathic and neuroischaemic dfus s6.3.7.

the type of ant-infective therapy provided to patients in this study pro- vided adequate anaerobe cover 25 of 39 wounds received antimicro- bials with anaerobe cover 64 and this may explain the lack of significance between high relative abundance of anaerobes in dfusand no increased tendency to fail therapy.thirteen patients 33.3 received narrow spectrum antimicrobials with nine 23.1 of these patients having dfus n 6 weeks duration.

in the group of five patients with dfus b 6 weeks four patients 80 with moderate idsa infections experi- enced treatment failure.

twenty-five patients received broad-spectrum anti- microbials with eleven patients 44 experiencing treatment failure.

we ascertained that both neuropathic and neuroischemic patients with mild to moderate pad dfus harbor similar microbiomes and the re- quirement to segregate these differing wound aetiologies may not be required for microbiota analysis when using a tbi cut off value of 0.5 as an arbitrary marker.nineteen patients during the study period experienced antimicrobi- al treatment failure but no differences existed in the microbiome of pa- tients who failed therapy and those who experienced treatment success.

patients  18 years presenting with a new diabetic foot infection dfi who had not received topical or oral antimicrobials in the two weeks prior to presentation were eligible for enrolment.

thirty-nine patients with infected dfus were recruited over twelve-months.

nineteen patients 49 during the study period experienced antimicrobial treatment failure but no overall differences existed in the microbiome of pa- tients who failed therapy and those who experienced treatment success p  0.2. our results confirm that short dfus have a simpler microbiome consisting of pyogenic cocci but chronic dfus have a highly polymicrobial microbiome.

molecular findings are correlated against clinical factors and treatment outcomes.materials and methodspatients samples and ethicsindividuals presenting to a tertiary referral hospital liverpool hos- pital high risk foot service and liverpool hospital emergency depart- ment with a newly infected diabetic foot ulcer occurring below the malleolus  were recruited consecutively over a twelve-month study period between january 2015 and december 2015. a 3 mm width x 10 mm depth tissue punch biopsy was ob- tained from the edge of each dfu after debriding and cleansing the wound with nacl 0.9. patients who had received any systemic or top- ical antimicrobial therapy two weeks prior to enrolment were excluded.

microorganisms com- mensal to the skin were predominant in half of patients 50.6 followed by environmental 29.1 gut 14 and oral 6.3 microorganisms.community structure of dfis are heterogeneousthe community structures of dfis were depicted using rarefaction and shannon weaver index plots which explore the richness and di- versity of individual infected dfus .

most dfus had complex polymicrobial communities with great heterogeneity between patients.
