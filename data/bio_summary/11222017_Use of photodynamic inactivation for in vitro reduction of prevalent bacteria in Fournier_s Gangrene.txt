Also it was evident that only light without the presence of PS was not able to promote microorganisms death.The association of red laser and methylene blue showed complete inactivation of S. aureus and C. perfrigens when light was applied for 5 mi- nutes in the presence of the PS even when these bacteria were cultured along with E. coli after 24 hours of incubation.

In the present study viable bacteria were separated in four groups Group L-F- no irradiation with red laser and absence of me- thylene blue photosensitizer Group L-F no irradiation with red laser and presenceSubmitted for publication May 18 2017of methylene blue Group LF- irradiation with red laser and absence of methylene blue and LF irradiation with red laser associated to methylene blue.

These essays were divided in 4 experimental groups Group L-F- no irradia- tion with red laser and absence of methylene bluephotosensitizer Group L-F no irradiation with red laser and presence of methylene blue Group LF- irradiation with red laser and absence of methylene blue and LF irradiation with red laser associated to methylene blue.

E. coli species also showed sensitivity to treatment however with exponential reduction.DIsCussIOnThis study showed that photodynamic inactivation associated to PS methylene blue was efficient to inactivate Staphylococcus au- reus Clostridium perfringens and E. coli obser- ved in FG severe necrotizing fasciitis involving several bacterial species that need new treat- ments to lower the high rates of morbidity and mortality 1-3.The use of these bacteria is in accordance of the fact that in FG there is multiple simulta- neous presence of aerobic and anaerobic micro- organisms we used a sample of each category a Gram positive aerobic a Gram negative aerobic and an anaerobic bacteria.

Recent studies show that Photodynamic Inactivation PDI may be a viable alternative since the action mode of photosensitizer PS over microbial cells is ma- rkedly different from the typical action of most antibiotic drugs 6.PDI is based on topic or systemic admi- nistration of a non-toxic PS followed by low dose irradiation of visible light with adequate wave length 7.

Therefore in view of the potential of this technique to treat bacterial infections among other microorganisms the objective of this work was to inactivate prevalent bacteria in FG using PDI.Among the most used photosensitizers PS in PDI some stand out natural occurring porphyrins particular Protoporphyrin IX chloro- phylls and biocompatible PS that don't generate toxicity at dark 9.

According to literature data some fac- tors may have influenced the non-complete eli- mination of bacteria such as structural difference of the wall of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria the relative permeability of Gram posi- tive membranes may be a facilitator of entrance of PS and the more complex external membrane of Gram negative bacteria may work as a barrier to PS entrance.

As observed in the group treated only with me-Figure 1 - Mean CFumL of s. aureus submitted to the following treatments saline as control L-P- laser and saline LP- photosensitizer L-P and laser and photosensitizer LP Tukey test p0.05.Figure 2 - Mean CFumL of C. perfrigens submitted to the following treatments saline as control L-P- laser and saline LP- photosensitizer L-P and laser and photosensitizer LP Tukey test p  0.05.thylene blue there was no bacterial inactivation in all studied times demonstrating that micro- organisms were not also sensitive to PS alone.

In the groups treated only with PS L-F and in the groups treated only with laser it was not ob- served exponential regression of microorganis- ms. As shown in Table-1 CFU media log of S. aureus and C. perfrigens bacteria were sensitive to PDI.

Our results show that the group tre- ated with only methylene blue L-P showed microbial growth similar to that observed in theTable 1 - CFu log reduction of S. aureus and C. perfrigens and exponential reduction of E. coli.minutescontrol group without radiation and PS L-F-.
