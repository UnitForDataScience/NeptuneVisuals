californiae is a monocentric fungus that forms only a single sporangium on each unit of vegetative growth thallus while A. robustus is polycentric capable of forming multiple sporangia from a single center of growth Trinci et al.

N. californiae displayed no growth while A. robustus displayed inconsistent growth on xylose in batch culture perhaps due to subtle environmen- tal cues e.g.

We isolated RNA sequenced with greater than 50X coverage Tables S4 and S5 and analyzed transcript abundance using RSEM Li  Dewey to obtain expression counts for all transcripts during growth on glucose maltose cellobiose cellulose corn stover reed canary grass and switchgrass.Differential expression analysis identified a total of 350 unique CAZymes in N. californiae 53 of all CAZymes and 202 66 in A. robustus that were significantly regulated greater than twofold change p  0.01 in response to growth on differing substrates compared to glucose.

Alternatively growth on cellobiose and cellulose as well as biomass triggered increased expression of cellulases hemicellulases and accessory enzymes in A. robustus Figure 3d suggesting a single trigger to regulate all biomass degrading enzymes in this fungal species a pattern very different than observed in N. californiae.It is important to note that both organisms demonstrated a significant basal expression level of biomass degrading enzymes on glucose approximately 21500 and 10500 TPM 2.15 and 1.05 of total transcriptome expression in N. californiae and A. robustus respectively.

Soluble substrates were added to a final concentration of 5 gL and particulate substrates to a final concentration of 10 gL.To monitor fungal proliferation the pressure of fermentation gases was measured during growth Theodorou Davies Nielsen Lawrence  Trinci Cultures that accumulated pressure significantly more than the blank control inoculated 10 ml Medium C culture lacking a carbon source were considered positive for growth.

Effective net specific growth rates greater than4.0 x 10-2 hr-1 on glucose fructose cellobiose maltose crystalline cellulose and lignocellulose Table S1 suggest that the extra energy required to express and secrete the enzymes required to break down complex biomass did not hinder growth.

While excess xylose and arabinose were expected to be present based on the results of growth experiments Table S1 glucose was likely present in large quantities because it is the most abundant sugar in biomass and it is present in greater abundance than needed to support fungal growth.

Conversely N. californiae requires growth on complex biomass to produce all necessary enzymes making enzyme purification more difficult.TABLE 1 Summary of up- and down-regulated CAZyme transcripts in anaerobic fungi under different growth conditions compared to basal expression on glucoseFurther insight into the regulatory mechanisms of gut fungi can be used to optimize enzyme production and achieve maximum lignocellulolytic activity and sugar handoff to model microorganisms.

While most of these observations are corroborated by growth experiments Table S1 the presence of xylose catabolism conflicts with growth experiments that revealed these gut fungi do not thrive on the pentose sugar Table S1.
