age healthy vs. diseased type of disease smokers vs. non-smokers background diet dose of epa  dha used relative contribution of epa and dha since they may have different anti-inflammatory potencies chemical formulation e.g.

furthermore plasma dha was inversely associated with il-6 and tnf-a concentrations and was also positively associated with the concentrations of il-10 and tgf-b .

serum non-esterified epa and dha were both inversely asso- ciated with concentrations of svcam-1 and sicam-1 in patients at risk of coronary heart disease  epa was also inversely associated with se-selectin concentration.

in old people high circulating il-6 levels are negatively associated with handgrip strength and explosive leg power  can predict the onset of disability  and are positively associated with higher risk of mortality .

the concentration of either epa or dha in granulocyte membranes was inversely associated with crp concentration in one study madsen et al.

actually ageing is accompanied by the accumulation of senescent cells in many if not all organs and tissues .senescent cells are characterised by a peculiar secretory phenotype termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype or sasp that entails the production of a number of inflammatory mediators including il-6 il-1b il-8 and other chemokines such as cxcl1 cxcl2 ccl3 ccl8 ccl13 ccl20 but also matrix metalloproteinases serine pro- teases and regulators of plasminogen activators pai-1 pai-2 growth factors soluble or shed receptors and non-protein factors such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species among others  .

the incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha into human inflammatory cells is partly at the expense of arachidonic acid resulting in less substrate available for synthesis of the classic in- flammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandin e2.

in ad- dition higher baseline il-6 and a steeper increase of il-6 levels with age were significantly and independently associated with a faster increase in multi-morbidity over time .studies have also suggested a role for lgi in frailty.

the same meta-analysis also considered 4 longitudinal studies and in this case il-6 and crp were not associated with frailty casting some doubts on the role of inflammation in frailty onset.

thus observational studies in a range of subgroups of the adult population in- cluding the elderly consistently suggest that both epa and dha are anti- inflammatory.studies of long chain omega-3 pufas in various adult groups are summarised in .

other factors which may affect and mod- ulate circulating levels of inflammatory mediators including obesity infections physical activity age-related decline in sex hormones and altered host-gut microbiota interaction may also be involved in theage-associated increase in lgi  .

these may involve a re- duction in lgi due to altered gut microbiota or they may involve other aspects of microbiota-host crosstalk.

in this regard healthy diets including the mediterranean diet are associated with lower concentrations of the inflammatory mediators that are hallmarks of lgi like crp and tnf-a   and conversely a western-style diet is associated with higher concentrations of these mediators  .

the very frequent association of dysbiosis with an altered inflammatory tone suggests an alteration in the crosstalk between commensal bacteria on the one side and intestinal epithelium including immune cells of the gut associated lymphoid tissue on the other side.
