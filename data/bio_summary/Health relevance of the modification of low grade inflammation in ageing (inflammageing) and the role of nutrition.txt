The incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA into human inflammatory cells is partly at the expense of arachidonic acid resulting in less substrate available for synthesis of the classic in- flammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandin E2.

age healthy vs. diseased type of disease smokers vs. non-smokers background diet dose of EPA  DHA used relative contribution of EPA and DHA since they may have different anti-inflammatory potencies chemical formulation e.g.

The connective tissue close to the epithelial cells lamina propria contains a large number of immune cells both of the innate immune system e.g.

Actually ageing is accompanied by the accumulation of senescent cells in many if not all organs and tissues .Senescent cells are characterised by a peculiar secretory phenotype termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype or SASP that entails the production of a number of inflammatory mediators including IL-6 IL-1b IL-8 and other chemokines such as CXCL1 CXCL2 CCL3 CCL8 CCL13 CCL20 but also matrix metalloproteinases serine pro- teases and regulators of plasminogen activators PAI-1 PAI-2 growth factors soluble or shed receptors and non-protein factors such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species among others  .

The concentration of either EPA or DHA in granulocyte membranes was inversely associated with CRP concentration in one study Madsen et al.

Serum non-esterified EPA and DHA were both inversely asso- ciated with concentrations of sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 in patients at risk of coronary heart disease  EPA was also inversely associated with sE-selectin concentration.

The same meta-analysis also considered 4 longitudinal studies and in this case IL-6 and CRP were not associated with frailty casting some doubts on the role of inflammation in frailty onset.

Thus observational studies in a range of subgroups of the adult population in- cluding the elderly consistently suggest that both EPA and DHA are anti- inflammatory.Studies of long chain omega-3 PUFAs in various adult groups are summarised in .

The ageing of the immune system termed immunosenescence has been suggested to be a consequence of continuous attrition caused by chronic antigenic overload and an inability of immune cell output for example from the thymus to keep up with the demand for naive cells  .
