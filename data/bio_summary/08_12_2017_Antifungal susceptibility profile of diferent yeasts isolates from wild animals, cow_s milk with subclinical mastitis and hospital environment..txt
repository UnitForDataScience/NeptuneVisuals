Yeasts were obtained from the mycology collection of Mycology Laboratory in the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology located in the Biology Institute from the Federal University of Pelotas.The yeasts isolates were identify and grouped in eight fungal genera each one with their respective species Candida albicans 11 C. guilliermondii 14 C. famata 10 C. parapsilosis 10 C. ciferri 4 C. catenulata 2C.

2002.The antifungal resistance in yeasts like any other microorganism can be classified as intrinsic resistance natural resistance and acquired resistance.

The increase of the antifungal resistance may be due to the use of selective therapies with inadequate doses or to the drug's frequent use in the fungal infection prophylaxis both in human and animals which may affect the selective clinical resistance Colombo and Guimaraes 2007Galle and Gianinni 2009.The Vitek 2 Compact system is an automatized commercial method for antifungal susceptibility analyses which determinates the spectrophotometric yeast growth allowing the identification of different species comparing the biochemical profile with a wide data base Al-Sweih et al.

2014 confirming its reliability in the identification.The four antifungal drugs studied showed different susceptibilities against the yeasts species wherein fluconazole presented a higher resistance against the three isolated origins followed by the amphotericin B and the voriconazole meanwhile the flucytosine presented efficiency against all yeasts present in this study none of the yeasts showed resistance to the flucytosine.

The isolated yeasts from the wild animal's microbiota showed a high resistance to the fluconazole 789 7.87 followed by the amphotericin B 389 3.37 and both were 100 susceptible to the flucytosine and the voriconazole Which demonstrates that human isolated yeasts had a major resistance than the yeasts isolated from wild animals to the antifungals used.

However the repetitive and prolonged fluconazole use inimmunologically compromised patients can developed resistance against this fungi.Many resistance mechanisms are well known such as the intrinsic fluconazole resistance expressed by isolates of C. krusei and C. glabrata Borowicz et al.

The fact that the Fluconazole had a higher resistance can be associated with the reason of being a drug commonly used mainly in human.The human's isolated yeasts presented a higher resistance to the tested drugs than the yeasts isolated from wild animals.

For the flucytosine the most susceptible species were C. guilliermondii C. albicans C. parapsilosis and C. famata.

presented susceptibility variations rates against the amphotericin B dividing the species inside this genus in two groups One group having the susceptible species such as C. guiiliermondii C. parapsilosis and C. albicans and the other group having the resistant species such asC.
