while infants in our study are likely to have been exposed to a small amount of probiotic in- directly either in utero or via breastmilk they were not administered the probiotic directly furthermore we found that prevalence of infant colic did not differ between the probiotic and placebo groups and hence there was little difference in the effect size when adjusted for in- fant colic.

interestingly probiotic supplementation in adults has not been found to substantially alter their gut microbiota as sampled by fecal samples   although this does not exclude their potential effect higher up in the small intestine or on the adherent mucosal gut microbiome.clinical trials of probiotic treatment have yielded mixed results andsystematic reviews of human trials concluded that the evidence for ben- eficial effects of probiotics on mood may not be as strong as some recent narrative studies purport .

to date probiotic effects on postnatal depression have not been studied in a clinical trial.our aim was to evaluate whether probiotic supplementation with lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 hn001 had a beneficial effect on post- natal symptoms of depression and anxiety in a group of healthy women.

of particular note there was little difference in the use of medications for psychological problems prior to the index pregnancy.the median adherence to allocated treatment did not differ probi- otic 923 iqr  839-972 placebo 911 iqr  818-969 p  030.depression and anxiety scores tended to increase with increasing in- terval between delivery and when the questionnaire was completed depression score increased by 085 per year p  0065 anxiety score increased by 066 per year p  0060. infant colic was associat- ed with higher depression multivariable p b 00001 and anxiety mul- tivariable p b 00001 scores but was not significantly associated with probiotic supplementation group p  0456. shows the mean and standard deviation of depression and anxiety scores in the probiotic treatment and placebo groups.

after controlling for infant colic and time since birth that questionnaires were completed probiotic supplementation remained significantly associated with reduced depression p  0037 and anxiety p  0014 scores.shows the number of women in the probiotic treatment and placebo groups who reported clinically significant depression or anxiety scores that is above the cut-off points.

the number of women reporting depression scores above the cut-off point did not differ signif- icantly between the probiotic treatment and placebo groups or  0.64 0.38 1.07 p  0086. however women in the probiotic treatment group were significantly less likely to have anxiety scores above the cut-off point than the placebo group or  0.44 0.27 0.73 p  0001 this association remained statistically significant afterfig.

national health and nutrition examination survey was an obser- vational study and found that probiotic foods or supplements were as- sociated with a reduced risk of depression but this was attenuated and non-significant when adjusted for factors that were associated with depression and probiotic exposure .

furthermore we have shown that this probiotic is safe and well tolerated in pregnancy and infants .this study provides evidence that probiotic supplementation withl.

not all probiotic strains have the same effect on health and it is possible that the results found using hn001 are not generalisable to other probiotic strains or at lower doses than those used in this study.

in 2005 it was first suggested that probiotics might be an adjuvant therapy for major depression  and others have also sug- gested that probiotic enhancement of gut microbiota may improve mood outcomes .

further- more probiotic treatment has also been shown to have a positive effect on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviour in animal studies    with mediating mechanisms in- cluding gaba receptor expression in specific locations of the central nervous system  the hpa axis   and the vagus nerve which transmits information from the gut luminal environment to the cns .

a recent study that was published after these reviews reported that obese women treated with a weight-reduction programme and probiotic had reduced symptoms of depression compared with the comparison group but this effect was not seen in men .
