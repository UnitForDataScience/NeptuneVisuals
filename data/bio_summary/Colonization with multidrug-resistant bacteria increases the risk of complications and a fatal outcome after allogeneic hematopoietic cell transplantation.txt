A higher incidence of MDRB infections was observed in patients with acute P  0.014 or chronic P  0.002 GVHD and in patients aged  40 years P  0.002.

pneumoniae P  0.001 ESBL-producing E. coli P  0.01 and CRPA P  0.003 and subsequent bacteremia caused by one of these pathogens.

MDRB infections were more common in patients with active acute P  0.014 or chronic GVHD P  0.002 as well as in patients age  40 years P  0.002.Fig.

Prior coloni- zation was significantly correlated with MDRB infections P  0.001 especially bacteremia P  0.038.

Colonization had a negative impact on overall survival OS after HCT 64 vs. 47 at 24 months P  0.034 and infection-associated mortality P  0.001.

Use of metronidazole was correlated with an increased incidence of acute GVHD P  0.001 and lower OS P  0.002.

Forty-nine patients 41 died during follow-up from the following relapse 13 infections 10 GVHD-related complications 14 or both GVHD and infections 3.Analysis of the MDRB-colonized group showed a signifi- cantly higher mortality rate P  0.034 and infection- associated mortality rate P  0.001 compared with the noncolonized group.
