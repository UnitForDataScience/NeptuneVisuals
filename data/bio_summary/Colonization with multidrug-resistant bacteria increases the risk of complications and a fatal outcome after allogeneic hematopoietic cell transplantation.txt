there was no significant correlation between the day of engraftment and the incidence of infections with alert pathogens p  0.25. mdrb infections were more common in patients with active acute p  0.014 or chronic gvhd p  0.002 as well as in patients age  40 years p  0.002.fig.

the incidence of acute gvhd showed a tendency to be higher in the colonized group than in the noncolonized group 27 vs. 18 however the difference was not significant p  0.26. we observed a higher incidence of acute gvhd among patients colonized with more than one species of mdrb p  0.046.metronidazole and acute graft-versus-host diseaseof the study group 17 patients 14 received metronidazole as treatment for c. difficile enterocolitis in ten patients and for other indications cholecystitis helicobacter pylori eradica- tion typhlitis in seven patients.

three of the 13 patients received vancomycin as the first-line treatment and experienced complete resolution of the symptoms.a sub-analysis of the proportion of our study group treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria re- vealed a temporal relationship between the introduction of metronidazole for c. difficile infection and the development or aggravation of acute gvhd p  0.001. a similar corre- lation was noted in the patient population treated with metro- nidazole for reasons other than c. difficile infection p  0.05.mortalitythe median follow-up time was 17 months range 0.4- 47 months.
