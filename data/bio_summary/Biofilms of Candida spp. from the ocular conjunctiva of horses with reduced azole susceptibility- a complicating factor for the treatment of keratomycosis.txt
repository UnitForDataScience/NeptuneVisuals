Some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the reduced susceptibility of Candida biofilms to azole drugs including the reduced metabolism of biofilm cells decreased drug penetration through the biofilm matrix and increased expression of specific genes by bio- film cells especially those that encode efflux pumps.3839Regarding the inhibitory activity of amphotericin B five of the eight tested biofilm-producing strains presented a reduction in biofilm metabolic activity after exposure to this drug corroborating the findings of Brucker et al.40and Brilhante et al.37 who reported that amphotericin B has a consistent activity against biofilms of Candida spp.

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the State University of Ceara UECE protocol number 12776861-0.Biofilm formationThe 15 studied strains were analyzed for their ability to form biofilm through the method described by Chatzi- moschou et al.13 with some modifications.

biofilmsThe biofilms were analyzed by scanning electron micro- scopy SEM according to Wang et al.15 with modifica- tions.

krusei and 8 lgmL against C. parapsilosis and C. guil- liermondii indicated resistance.17 For the other Candida species caspofungin MIC values 2 lgmL indicated that the strain is not susceptible to this drug.16Antifungal susceptibility of mature Candida biofilmsThe method described by Ramage et al.18 with modifi- cations was used to assess the inhibitory effect of the antifungal drugs on the biofilms formed by the tested strains.

After the addition of 100 lL of each drug the plates were further incubated at 35 degC for 48 h.The viability of the mature biofilms was assessed by the XTT assay according to Sidrim et al.19 XTT is an oxi- doreduction indicator that is reduced by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of metabolically active cells to the water- soluble formazan product.

Some studies have shown that C. tropicalis has a remarkable biofilm- forming ability834 and Cordeiro et al.34 for instance have shown that C. tropicalis isolated from animals has a note- worthy in vitro biofilm production.

Additionally two strains of C. glabrata were able to produce biofilm and were classified as weak and moderate producers corrobo- rating the findings of Silva et al.8 who reported a weaker biofilm-forming ability for this species.Several studies have reported that biofilms formed by Candida spp.

Similarly Brilhante et al.37 demonstrated that C. tropicalis biofilms are not affected by very high concentrations of azole drugs.
