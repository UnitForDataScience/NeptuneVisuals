16S rRNA gene sequencing identified a total of 161 individual taxa producing4.72 x 106 total reads from 16 x 2 samples.Identification of Common and Rare TaxaTo identify differences between common and rare taxa in PMA-treated and untreated conditions distribution abundance relationship plots were produced Figure 1.Significant positive distribution abundance relationships were observed between taxa abundance and persistence of taxa across samples in both treatment conditions untreated r2  0.58 n  120 P  0.001 PMA-treated r2  0.72 n  97 P  0.001.Using this relationship taxa in the upper quartile of occupancy 75 samples in each treatment condition were classified as common the remaining taxa were classified as rare.Distribution of taxa appeared more even in the PMA-treated condition fewer ubiquitous taxa dominate the communities in the PMA-treated condition 2 taxa compared to the untreated condition 6 taxa.In untreated sample conditions 6 taxa were identified as common all of which were observed in every sample.

SIMPER provides an insight in to the variance expressed as a percentage between abundance of taxa from the untreated group and the PMA- treated group.Table 2 illustrates which taxa contributed greatest to dissimilarity of common and rare community structures between untreated and PMA-treated conditions.Greater average dissimilarity is observed in rare 83.21 than common 42.87 taxa.

This suggests that the presence of non-viable DNA originating from highly abundant species such as Bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae could potentially mask that of less abundant species such as Enterococcus Clostridium Peptoniphilus and Actinomyces sp.As volcano plots Figure 5 only represent fold change in abundance for taxa present in both sample conditions rank abundance plots Figure 6 were generated to illustrate abundance of taxa identifiable in only one treatment condition.Fewer taxa were observed PMA-treated than untreated sample conditions.

2 AAverage dissimilarity between conditions  83.21Non-PMA-treatedPMA-treated BCut-off value set at taxa contributing 1 to dissimilarity between treatment conditions.Denotes taxa only attributed common status in PMA-treated condition.Cut-off set at taxa contributing 1 to dissimilarity between treatment conditions.taxa abundances were reduced to 0.009 following PMA- treatment.

This is most probably due to the suppression of DNA sequence reads from rare taxa by dominant taxa as illustrated by the reduced bacterial diversity and presence of rare taxa observed in PMA-treated samples.These findings are of particular relevance in the gut microbiota of the preterm infants analysed in this study due to administration of probiotic supplements.
