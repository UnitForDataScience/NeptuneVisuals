Qin et al.6 found that ammonia production and gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA biosynthesis were enriched in patients with liver cir- rhosis by their comparative metagenomic analysis with gene functional classification suggesting a potential role of gut microbiome in the development of HE.6On the other hand Wei et al.30 surprisingly found increased bacterial metabolic activities of carbohydrate branched-chain amino acids pantothenate and CoA with the progression of diseases from Child-Pugh class A to class C by their metaproteome analysis.

tight junctions TJs and gap junctions allow selective passage of substances.27 Structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosa that enhance intestinal permeability are found in patients with liver cirrhosis.27 This intestinal barrier dysfunction is a dominant pathogenetic factor for several complications of liver cirrhosis.31 Alcohol drinking portal hypertension changes in gut microbiome inflamma- tion oxidative stress and endotoxemia can all affect the barrier function of the intestine.Several researchers32-35 have reported that patients with liver cirrhosis exhibit increased intestinal permeability the state of so-called leaky gut.

for SBP and E. coli Enterococcus Staphylococ- cus aureus and Lactococcus for urinary tract infections.17 Most bacteria causing SBP are Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family Enterobacter Klebsiella and Proteus which are predominant in the gut microbiota of cirrhotic patients.5711Hyperdynamic circulationHyperdynamic circulation characterized by low systemic vascular resistance high cardiac output and a reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictors are features of liver cirrhosis.3 A low systemic vascular resistance and a high cardiac output were more prominent in cirrhotics with endotoxemia than in those without endotoxemia.41 Oral administration of rifaximin was shown to improve the hyperdynamic circulation and endotoxemia.70 Further the probiotic VSL3 was found to improve the hyperdynamic circulation in patients with liver cirrhosis.72 Although the role of endotoxin in the process of hyperdynamic circulation is still debatable endotoxemia possibly related to gut dysbiosis and leaky gut may stimulate NO synthase inducing increased vascular NO production which is the primary force to evoke vasodilatation and its clin- ical manifestations in cirrhosis.73Portal hypertension and variceal bleedingEndotoxemia is also postulated to increase portal pressure74 and to induce variceal bleeding.7576 It is plausible that endo- toxin may elevate portal pressure by inducing systemic and splanchnic vasodilation and by triggering hepatic inflamma- tory responses.374 It may increase portal vascular resistance through the cytokine-induced release of endothelin NO and cyclooxygenase products in the liver.77-79 In turn portal hypertension can promote BT and endotoxemia in patients with liver cirrhosis.74 Portal endotoxin level was decreased by the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt sug- gesting that microbial translocation may be alleviated by the portal venous decompression.80 The effect of portal hyper- tension or portal venous decompression on gut microbiome has not been clarified yet.Patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemor- rhage have increased risk of bacterial infections particularly SBP during the first 7 days.81 Plasma endotoxin levels and intestinal permeability were reported to be increased after variceal hemorrhage.3682 The latter was identified as an inde- pendent predictor for proven or possible infections by multi- variate analysis.36 Prophylactic use of antibiotics can prevent infection and rebleeding and increase the short-term survival rate in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal hemor- rhage following endoscopic treatment.7583Renal disturbanceHepatorenal syndrome HRS is a severe complication of patients characterized by a combination of systemic circula- tory disturbance and renal dysfunction.

They remain undi- gested until they reach the large bowel where they are metabolized by colonic bacteria and generate acetic and lactic acids.38 The resulting lower pH is considered to inhibit urease-producing bacteria and to promote the growth of non- urease-producing Lactobacilli.38101 Chen et al.102 described that lactitol increased beneficial Bifidobacteria and Lactoba- cilli and decreased plasma endotoxin levels in patients with chronic viral hepatic diseases.In contrast to these culture-based studies Bajaj et al.17 reported an increase in dysbiosis with lower CDR and higher abundance of Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacteriaceae Bacteroidaceae despite lactulose administration in patients with HE which suggested that the effect of lactulose may not be attributable to improvement of dysbiosis.

1A.On the other hand Bajaj et al.11 reported that fecal micro-biota in patients from the United States with alcohol-related and hepatitis C virus HCV-related liver cirrhosis had a lower proportion of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae and a higher proportion of Alcaligeneceae Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacteriaceae Fig.

The CDR was found to be negatively cor- related to the model of end-stage liver disease MELD score as well as the blood endotoxin level.17 A low CDR was also found to be associated with death and organ failure within 30 days.17Intestinal mucosal dysbiosisBajaj et al.18 examined the rectosigmoidal mucosal micro- biome in addition to the fecal microbiome as the former may reflect the intestinal barrier condition more precisely.

Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of fecal microbe in patients with liver cirrhosiswhich may ultimately enhance the astrocyte swelling in HE.58 Clinically endotoxemia is associated with severity of minimal HE MHE and an increased incidence of overt HE.57 SIBO is closely related to MHE59 and the orocecal transit time OCTT is prolonged in cirrhotics with HE.60 Translo- cated bacterial DNA is considered to worsen neurocognitive scores in patients with MHE.61Several studies have revealed altered gut microbiota in cirrhotic patients with HE.62 Liu et al.63 found an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli E. coli and Staph- ylococcus spp.

J Clin Transl Hepatol 201753249-260. doi 10.14218JCTH.2017.00008.IntroductionLiver cirrhosis is a consequence of long-lasting chronic liver diseases and is characterized by liver fibrosis and portal hypertension.

They provoke inflammatory changes in the liver and various extrahepatic sites facilitat- ing the progression of liver cirrhosis and the development of cirrhotic complications.Various microbiome-based therapeutics such as probiotics prebiotics synbiotics and antibiotics have been applied for the management of HE and other complications.

Secondary BAs have membrane destabilizing actions both on the microbiome and on the gut epithelium.2324 It is not evident at present if this reduction in secondary BAs is either a cause of overgrowth of pathogenic bacte- ria2526 or a result of an adaptation to prevent gut epithelial disruption in liver cirrhosis.22 BT-induced inflammation sup- presses the synthesis of total BAs by inhibiting CYP7A1 in the liver Fig.
