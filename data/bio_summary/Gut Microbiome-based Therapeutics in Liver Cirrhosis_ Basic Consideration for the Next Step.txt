for sbp and e. coli enterococcus staphylococ- cus aureus and lactococcus for urinary tract infections.17 most bacteria causing sbp are gram-negative bacilli such as e. coli and other members of the enterobacteriaceae family enterobacter klebsiella and proteus which are predominant in the gut microbiota of cirrhotic patients.5711hyperdynamic circulationhyperdynamic circulation characterized by low systemic vascular resistance high cardiac output and a reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictors are features of liver cirrhosis.3 a low systemic vascular resistance and a high cardiac output were more prominent in cirrhotics with endotoxemia than in those without endotoxemia.41 oral administration of rifaximin was shown to improve the hyperdynamic circulation and endotoxemia.70 further the probiotic vsl3 was found to improve the hyperdynamic circulation in patients with liver cirrhosis.72 although the role of endotoxin in the process of hyperdynamic circulation is still debatable endotoxemia possibly related to gut dysbiosis and leaky gut may stimulate no synthase inducing increased vascular no production which is the primary force to evoke vasodilatation and its clin- ical manifestations in cirrhosis.73portal hypertension and variceal bleedingendotoxemia is also postulated to increase portal pressure74 and to induce variceal bleeding.7576 it is plausible that endo- toxin may elevate portal pressure by inducing systemic and splanchnic vasodilation and by triggering hepatic inflamma- tory responses.374 it may increase portal vascular resistance through the cytokine-induced release of endothelin no and cyclooxygenase products in the liver.77-79 in turn portal hypertension can promote bt and endotoxemia in patients with liver cirrhosis.74 portal endotoxin level was decreased by the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt sug- gesting that microbial translocation may be alleviated by the portal venous decompression.80 the effect of portal hyper- tension or portal venous decompression on gut microbiome has not been clarified yet.patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemor- rhage have increased risk of bacterial infections particularly sbp during the first 7 days.81 plasma endotoxin levels and intestinal permeability were reported to be increased after variceal hemorrhage.3682 the latter was identified as an inde- pendent predictor for proven or possible infections by multi- variate analysis.36 prophylactic use of antibiotics can prevent infection and rebleeding and increase the short-term survival rate in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal hemor- rhage following endoscopic treatment.7583renal disturbancehepatorenal syndrome hrs is a severe complication of patients characterized by a combination of systemic circula- tory disturbance and renal dysfunction.

tumor necrosis factor tnf il-2 il-4 il-6 and il-8 are increased especially in patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis or in those with massive ascites.48 up-regulation of tlr2 and tlr4 and their pro-inflammatory mediators activates hepatic stellate cells and enhances fibrosis leading to the progression of liver cirrhosis and finally the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.49 on the contrary tlr4 expression is down- regulated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of cirrhotics.50-52a cytosolic multiprotein complex inflammasome is assembled upon recognition of pamps and accelerates inflam- matory reactions by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1b and il-18 through the activation of caspase-1.53 in macrophages from ascitic fluid one of the inflammasome components aim2 the hin-200 domain-containing protein absent in melanoma 2 pre-activated by bacterial dna frag- ments produces high levels of il-1b and il-18 which predis- pose to sbp in liver cirrhosis.53gut impact on various cirrhotic complicationshethe mechanism of he remains unclarified although hyper- ammonemia and systemic inflammation related to gut dysbiosis have been proposed as contributors.54 accumulat- ing evidence indicates that systemic inflammation neuroin- flammation and endotoxemia play cardinal roles in the pathogenesis of he.55-57 endotoxin is known to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier and to act on the brain microglia through endothelial cell receptors with the succeeding production of nitric oxide no and prostanoid57table 1. metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of fecal microbe in patients with liver cirrhosiswhich may ultimately enhance the astrocyte swelling in he.58 clinically endotoxemia is associated with severity of minimal he mhe and an increased incidence of overt he.57 sibo is closely related to mhe59 and the orocecal transit time octt is prolonged in cirrhotics with he.60 translo- cated bacterial dna is considered to worsen neurocognitive scores in patients with mhe.61several studies have revealed altered gut microbiota in cirrhotic patients with he.62 liu et al.63 found an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic escherichia coli e. coli and staph- ylococcus spp.

tight junctions tjs and gap junctions allow selective passage of substances.27 structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosa that enhance intestinal permeability are found in patients with liver cirrhosis.27 this intestinal barrier dysfunction is a dominant pathogenetic factor for several complications of liver cirrhosis.31 alcohol drinking portal hypertension changes in gut microbiome inflamma- tion oxidative stress and endotoxemia can all affect the barrier function of the intestine.several researchers32-35 have reported that patients with liver cirrhosis exhibit increased intestinal permeability the state of so-called leaky gut.

their results are contradictory to the concept that gut bacterial changes cause metabolic disturbances in liver cirrhosis and arouse a question of whether we can really improve the met- abolic state of cirrhotic patients by correcting gut dysbiosis.microbial products and host reactionleaky gut and bacterial translocationthe intestinal barrier consists of intestinal epithelial cells and their mucinous components.27 intercellular junctions i.e.
