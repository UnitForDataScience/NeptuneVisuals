Qin et al.6 found that ammonia production and gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA biosynthesis were enriched in patients with liver cir- rhosis by their comparative metagenomic analysis with gene functional classification suggesting a potential role of gut microbiome in the development of HE.6On the other hand Wei et al.30 surprisingly found increased bacterial metabolic activities of carbohydrate branched-chain amino acids pantothenate and CoA with the progression of diseases from Child-Pugh class A to class C by their metaproteome analysis.

tight junctions TJs and gap junctions allow selective passage of substances.27 Structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosa that enhance intestinal permeability are found in patients with liver cirrhosis.27 This intestinal barrier dysfunction is a dominant pathogenetic factor for several complications of liver cirrhosis.31 Alcohol drinking portal hypertension changes in gut microbiome inflamma- tion oxidative stress and endotoxemia can all affect the barrier function of the intestine.Several researchers32-35 have reported that patients with liver cirrhosis exhibit increased intestinal permeability the state of so-called leaky gut.

for SBP and E. coli Enterococcus Staphylococ- cus aureus and Lactococcus for urinary tract infections.17 Most bacteria causing SBP are Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family Enterobacter Klebsiella and Proteus which are predominant in the gut microbiota of cirrhotic patients.5711Hyperdynamic circulationHyperdynamic circulation characterized by low systemic vascular resistance high cardiac output and a reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictors are features of liver cirrhosis.3 A low systemic vascular resistance and a high cardiac output were more prominent in cirrhotics with endotoxemia than in those without endotoxemia.41 Oral administration of rifaximin was shown to improve the hyperdynamic circulation and endotoxemia.70 Further the probiotic VSL3 was found to improve the hyperdynamic circulation in patients with liver cirrhosis.72 Although the role of endotoxin in the process of hyperdynamic circulation is still debatable endotoxemia possibly related to gut dysbiosis and leaky gut may stimulate NO synthase inducing increased vascular NO production which is the primary force to evoke vasodilatation and its clin- ical manifestations in cirrhosis.73Portal hypertension and variceal bleedingEndotoxemia is also postulated to increase portal pressure74 and to induce variceal bleeding.7576 It is plausible that endo- toxin may elevate portal pressure by inducing systemic and splanchnic vasodilation and by triggering hepatic inflamma- tory responses.374 It may increase portal vascular resistance through the cytokine-induced release of endothelin NO and cyclooxygenase products in the liver.77-79 In turn portal hypertension can promote BT and endotoxemia in patients with liver cirrhosis.74 Portal endotoxin level was decreased by the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt sug- gesting that microbial translocation may be alleviated by the portal venous decompression.80 The effect of portal hyper- tension or portal venous decompression on gut microbiome has not been clarified yet.Patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemor- rhage have increased risk of bacterial infections particularly SBP during the first 7 days.81 Plasma endotoxin levels and intestinal permeability were reported to be increased after variceal hemorrhage.3682 The latter was identified as an inde- pendent predictor for proven or possible infections by multi- variate analysis.36 Prophylactic use of antibiotics can prevent infection and rebleeding and increase the short-term survival rate in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal hemor- rhage following endoscopic treatment.7583Renal disturbanceHepatorenal syndrome HRS is a severe complication of patients characterized by a combination of systemic circula- tory disturbance and renal dysfunction.
