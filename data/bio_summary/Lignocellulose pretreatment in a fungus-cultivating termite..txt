Lignin aro- matic regions are shown for the original poplar wood A fresh fungus comb B middle-aged fungus comb C and mature fungus comb D. Correlations from the major aromatic ring unit types are well dispersed and color coded by their indicated structures.

Moreover the comparative studies of fresh and middle-aged fungus comb showed that continuous cleavage of lignin sidechains is occurring throughout this process but with no furtherdepletion in the mature fungus comb implying the bacterial lineages in the fresh comb derived from the feces of young workers may have similar lignin-degrading abilities to those in the gut and thus sub- sequently contribute to the complete lignin depolymerization 39 40.Confirmation of Lignin Depolymerization and Degradation by Pyrolysis- GC-MS and Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide-Pyrolysis-GC-MS. To establish whether a significant decrease in aromatic units had occurred during the fungus-cultivating termite pretreatment the original poplar wood and fungus comb samples were subjected to pyrolysis Py-GC-MS the pyrograms of which with their num- bered peaks identifying lignin-derived phenols are shown in Fig.

As dominant decomposers an O. formosanus colony forms in sub- tropical China with massive fungus combs underground A which are made of various plant materials foraged by worker termites B. Age-related labor division in food processing of fungus-cultivating termites C. Old workers forage outside and transport plant materials back to nest and form a food store i young workers ingest the food store ii imbue them with the fungal nodules that are rich in asexual Termitomyces spores iii and use their feces to build fresh fungus combs iv old workers gain their nutrition by consuming the mature fungus comb v. D The development of Termitomyces fungi in fungal comb the poplar fungal comb has a cycle time of 45 d. The Termi- tomyces spores and plant materials rapidly pass through the gut of young worker 3.5 h and form as fresh comb with the fast spores germination i after 15 d of growth the middle-aged comb with dense fungal mycelia and fungal nodules ii and after 30 d more growth the comb materials complete maturation and containing little recognizable mycelia iii.Lignin degradation mechanisms in fungus-cultivating termite systems have remained contentious since it was revealed that the ectosymbiotic fungi Termitomyces spp.

The b-ether units A decreased by 28 going from the wood to the fresh fungus comb followed by an additional 57 from fresh to the middle-aged comb but no further depletion in the mature fungus comb.

To investigate lignocellulose degradation we first physi- cally and chemically characterized the fungus comb and the original poplar wood samples by both scanning electron microscopy and chemical compositional analyses.

Because other plant material inputs were prevented these results suggest that young worker termites are also engaged in degrading lignocellulose.To determine the transit time of wood particles through the guts of young workers to passage through the fungus comb in Odon- totermes formosanus we conducted food-stain marker feeding experiments details provided in SI Appendix SI Materials and Methods and Fig.
