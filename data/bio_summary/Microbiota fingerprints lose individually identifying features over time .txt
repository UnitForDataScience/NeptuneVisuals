in keeping with the 58-77 accuracy rates previously reported for this method the accuracy rate was highly sensitive to the number of individuals or groups of individuals to which a householdtable 1 summary of collected samplessample propertyvalues number of samplestypeair 144 skin 380 surface 288seasonwinter 2014 203 spring 2014 203 summer 2014 203 autumn 2014 203residenceadmiralty a 68 fortress hill 68 ma on shan 108 quarry bay 88 sai wan 88 sha tin wai 88 tai koo 108 tuen mun b 108 wu kai sha 88sitebed headboard surface 36 bedroom air 36 blanket surface 36 forehead skin 76 fridge door seal surface 36 kitchen air 36 kitchen ventilator surface 36 left forearmskin 76 left palm skin 76 living room air 36 remote control surface 36 right forearm skin 76 right palm skin 76 shower curtain surface 36 toilet air 36 toilet flush button surface 36tv screen surface 36individual skin onlyadmiralty a z 20 fortress hill z 20 ma on shan w 20 ma on shan x 20 ma on shan y 20quarry bay y 20 quarry bay z 20 sai wan y 20 sai wan z 20 sha tin wai x 20 sha tin wai y 20 tai koo x 20 tai koo y 20 tai koo z 20 tuen mun b w 20 tuen mun b x 20 tuen mun b y 20 wu kai sha w 20 wu kai sha y 20could be matched.

otus that persisted for more than one season comprised a slightly but significantly mann-whitney p 0.05 higher proportion by relative abundance of skin samples mean 83 per sample than surface 81 while otus present in all four seasons comprised a mean abundance of 60 of skin samples but 57 of sur- face samples mann-whitney p  0.05. this may explain the skewed distributions of both microbiota matching accuracy and weighted unifrac distances over different sampling delays as the higher abundance of stable otus on skin could cause shared microbiota to persist for longer on skin than on surfaces.

while sources including outdoor air and pets can contribute to residential surface micro- biota occupant skin contributes a large proportion or majority of surface microbiota occupants' skin microbiota rapidly colonise a newly occupied resi- dence and a person leaving a residence can cause a decline in microbiota similarity within days suggesting that household surface assemblages closely track changes inc the authors.

b. on average 60 se 11 10-2  of each surface sample's microbiota was estimated to originate from occupant skin within-sea- son comparisons compared to 17 se 88 x 10-3 from air 76 x 10-3  se 63 x 10-4  from negative control samples and 23 se 75 10-  from unknown sources kruskal-wallis p  0.05. finally we examined whether an occupant's skin microbiota resembled surface micro- biota from their residence more than surface microbiota from other residences fig.

while the family moraxellaceae was the most com- monly represented in the hitting sets as it was among all skin microbiota overall the taxonomic distribution of hitting set otus did not closely resemble that of the total skin microbiota with non-skin-associated families such as the sphingomonadaceae rhodobac- teraceae and weeksellaceae among the most common hitting set members additional file  table s1.we used cox proportional hazard models to relate otu abundance indicator value and hitting set mem- bership to the probability of an otu being lost from either skin or surfaces or of being deposited from skin to surface in a microbiota trace.

this suggests that both skin and surface microbiota contained popula- tions of stable otus that persisted for many seasons comprising 30 of the otus present at any time as well as transient otus that persisted for one season or shorter.

as interest in the forensic potential of microbiota match- ing continues to grow it is important that this practical limitation be investigated.this study attempted microbial matching of individuals to their places of residence based on comparison of skin microbiota to household surface microbiota traces to determine whether accurate microbial matching could be achieved even with large time delays between skin and surface sampling.

given that the failure of hitting sets to successfully re- identify individuals over time is largely driven by false negatives additional file figure s2 this implies that the degradation of skin hitting set performance overtime is driven mainly by loss of identifying otus rather than by hitting set otus becoming more prevalent and thereby less useful for identification surface otus by contrast were 0.84x as likely to be lost if they belonged to an individual's hitting set although more likely to be lost if they had a high indicator value.one explanation for the preferential loss of identifying otus from skin is simply that they tend to be less abun- dant and are therefore less stable over time.

little attention has been given to the time for which identifiable microbiota traces persist on surfaces and given that an individual's correspondence school of energy and environment city university of hong kongb5423-ac1 tat chee avenue kowloon hong kong special administrative region of chinaskin microbiota can change significantly within weeks or months  it is unclear whether an individual's current skin microbiota would be similar enough to an older microbiota trace for a reliable identification to be made.

reported that while hitting sets are relatively stable across time in gut and oral microbiota allowing up to 80 accurate re- identification of individuals over time skin microbiota otu hitting sets are relatively unstable and do not permit accurate identification on repeat sampling we found a similar result in this dataset additional file figure s2 consistent with the hypothesis that the decreasing accuracy of microbiota matching over time is related to the loss of highly identifying otus.

however by virtue of their specificity these otus may be particularly susceptible to loss from skin microbiota failure to be deposited on a surface as a microbiota trace or loss from a deposited trace.

because these transient otus are less likely to be adapted to the skin environment and would not have their populations replenished by repeat exposure they would be more exposed to eventual loss regardless of their abundance.abundant otus were also more likely to be deposited from skin to a household surface with otus in the 99th percentile of abundance having 3.9x the baseline probability.

this study also examined oper- ational taxonomic unit otu stability on skin and sur- faces and applied survival analysis to determine whether the value of otus in identifying individuals was related to their temporal stability and chance of deposition from skin to surface.results and discussionwe collected microbiota samples from household sur- faces household air and residents' skin in nine hong kong residences throughout 2014 table  and deter- mined the microbiota compositions through 16s rrna gene analysis.

hitting sets as applied to microbiota matching are algorithmically determined minimal sets of otus that uniquely identify individualswithin a cohort thereby making membership of an otu in a hitting set a useful marker of that otu's value in microbiota matching.
