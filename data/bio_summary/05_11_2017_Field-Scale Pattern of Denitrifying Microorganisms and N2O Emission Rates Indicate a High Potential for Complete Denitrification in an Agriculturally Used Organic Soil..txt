This might be due to i the niche partitioning of microbes contain- ing copper encoded by nirK or cytochrome cd1 encoded by nirS nitrite reductases ii the fact that one third of all denitrifying microbes use truncated denitrification pathwaysTable 1Primer and thermal profiles used for real-time PCR quantification of the genes nirS nirK and nosZ.

Most samples taken from the soil under investiga- tion had a water content of between 45 and 60 ww data not shown and a TOC content of above 12 and were thus characterised by favourable denitrification conditions.Besides the observation of low N2O emissions the spatial and correlation analyses differed considerably between theWhile NH4 correlated positively with the abundance of denitrifying microbes NO3- correlated negatively even though NO - is the direct denitrification substrate and regarded as a major driver of the denitrification processes.

This observation was fur- ther underlined by the fact that the correlation of nirK and the slowly degradable carbon and nitrogen pools TOC or Nt de- creased from an R2 of 0.49 and 0.39 p  0.001 in March respectively to R2 of 0.03 in October.In conclusion our data indicate that the high denitrification potential of this drained organic soil prevents the distinct niche separation of microbes harbouring either nirK- and nirS-type nitrite reductase genes and favours microbes that possess nosZ genes thus leading to the emission of N2 rather than N2O.

Numerous studies have observed that the spatial distribution of denitrifying microbes in soils varies considerably and that the denitrifier community's spatial patterns of size and activity correlate strongly with environmental factors  .

In March the abundance of denitrifiers was highly correlated R2  0.8 p  0.001 and indicated a spatial coexistence of microbes harbouring nirK and nirS Fig.

By targeting the nirK nirS and nosZ genes the current study compares spatio-temporal distribution of denitrifying microbes in an agricultural soil with high organic matter content at the beginning March and end October of the vegetation period.
