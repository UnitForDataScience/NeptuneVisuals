the observed swelling behavior of the cmc-cht particles is very suitable for the delivery of probiotics in the intestinal tract since particles undergo little swelling at ph 2-4 particles stable at ph values typical for the stomach while they undergo considerable swelling at ph conditions typically found in the intestinal tract ph 8. the delivery of probiotics under conditions mimicking those of the gastrointestinal tract will be a matter of further studies.probiotic encapsulation and viabilitythe probiotic lgg was encapsulated in the different particle for- mulations as described in the material and methods section.

the particles were stable at ph 2.4 which is the gastric ph and swell considerably at higher phs in particular at ph 7.4 a close ph of the intestine.

on the other hand the physical systems are ph sensitive presenting a remarkable swelling at ph 7.4 while little swelling is observed at ph 2.4. furthermore model probiotic bacteria lactobacil- lus rhamnosus gg was for the first time successfully encapsulated in the cmc-cht based particles with acceptable viability count.

at ph 2.4 cht is pro- tonated pka 6.5  while at ph 5 cmc is also ionized pka 3.65 and thus a lower swelling should be expected at this ph when both the oppositely charged polymers are ionized.

natural and synthetic hydrogels are used in products in a number of biological and environmental areas what makes the delivery through hydrogel-based systems more excit- ing is that they can exhibit a wide variety of smart responses according to the changes in the surrounding physiological con- ditions  therefore it is possible to have for instance ph- or thermal-sensitive systems with delivery triggered by precise changes in those parameters  sherbiny so far among the many hydrogel-based systems 0144-8617c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.developed high focus has been given to sugar-based biopolymers for biocompatibility and availability reasons  it is thus not surprising that a lot of work has been devoted to chitin and cellulose based systems the two most abundant natural poly- mers on earth  chitosan cht is composed of a1 4 2-amino 2-deoxy -d-glucan units randomly organized and it is obtained from the deacetylation of chitin.

on the other hand the absorption bands between 1000 cm-1 and 1100 cm-1 were attributed to c o and c n stretching and c c n bending vibra- tions.

the macro 1 and macro 2 stand for the cht  cmc physical macroparticles and cht  cmc chemical macroparti- cles respectively while the micro 1 and micro 2 stand for the cht  cmc physical microparticles and cht  cmc chemical microparticles respectively.

such difference in porosity may affect the release of probiotic bacteria from the particles.the particles are formed by the association between the oppositely charged cht and cmc and as mixtures of titrating poly- electrolytes these systems are highly sensitive to ph changes.
