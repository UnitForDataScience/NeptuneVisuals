The Macro 1 and Macro 2 stand for the Cht  CMC physical macroparticles and Cht  CMC chemical macroparti- cles respectively while the Micro 1 and Micro 2 stand for the Cht  CMC physical microparticles and Cht  CMC chemical microparticles respectively.

The observed swelling behavior of the CMC-Cht particles is very suitable for the delivery of probiotics in the intestinal tract since particles undergo little swelling at pH 2-4 particles stable at pH values typical for the stomach while they undergo considerable swelling at pH conditions typically found in the intestinal tract pH 8.

The same type of mor- phologies is found for the related crosslinked particle systems data not shown.The encapsulation efficiency was estimated after mechanically disintegrating the particles in a phosphate buffer pH  7.4 by stir-ring them at 37 C. After that the number of entrapped cells byserial dilution was measured by drop the plate method and counts were expressed as number CFU and calculated as EE  Log 10NLog 10N0 x 100 where EE stands for entrapmentencapsulation effi-ciency N is the number of viable entrapped bacteria released from the particles and N0 is the number of freenaked bacteria taken as control  The physical macro- and micro particles pre- sented an EE of ca.

On the other hand systems crosslinked with genipin show an average zeta potential around 8 mV due to the reac- tion of genipin with the charged amino groups and particles are more susceptible to aggregation as shown in D. The incorpo- ration of LGG negatively charged cells further makes the particles more negatively charged thus giving a higher colloidal stability and a reduced tendency to aggregation.In terms of mechanism the crosslinking involves a nucleophilicattack fast reaction of the amino group of Cht on the C-3 olefinic carbon of genipin which results in the opening of the dihydropyran ring and the formation of a tertiary amine.

Moreover the crosslinked systems show higher values of the weight loss in this range of temperatures probably due to a partial weakening of the Cht structure caused by the crosslinking with genipin  This effect has been observed in related systems such as in Cht crosslinked with tannic acid  and in gluteraldehyde crosslinked films  Nevertheless overall the TGA curves indicate that the obtained chemical and physical gel particles are thermally sta- ble in the temperature range suitable for probiotic bacteria.In representative SEM images of the macro- and micro par- ticles are shown.

The morphologies are particularly different upon cross-linking with genipin compare for instance and B while the physical gel particles resulting from the CMC-Cht electro- static association alone are significantly porous the chemical gel particles present a much denser structure with no visible porosity.

Thus in an extra experiment particles have been exposed to this pH and showed an average size of 2.3 mm similar size to the native particles with negligi- ble swelling.

probiotic bacteria surrounded by alternated layers of Cht and CMC  There- fore the main objective of this work is to design new bio-based CMC-Cht particles capable to efficiently encapsulate the a model probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG LGG.

The Cht solution was kept under continuous agitation to facilitate the solvent- polymer diffusion and interaction during the hardening of the gel particles.

Finally the PBS supernatant was discarded and ten bacterial pellets were mixed with 20 mL of 1 wt of CMC aque- ous solution forming the micro and macrobeads by adding them to 1 ww Cht solution.Evaluation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ViabilityTo estimate the viable counts the encapsulated bacteria was released from the particles by re-suspending in a PBS buffer solution at 37 C for 30 min under stirring pH 7.4 followed by homogenization.
