Vaginal Lactobacillus strains L. crispatus ATCC 33820T L. vaginalis NCFB 2810 L. gasseri ATCC 33323T L. jensenii RC28 and L. jensenii ATCC 25258 and Lactobacillus johnsonii ATCC 20553 were cultured anaerobically on MRS agar Becton Dickinson  Company Sparks MD in jars at 37degC.

qPCR was performed on swab genomic DNA gDNA for 16S or16S-23S rRNA genes of A. vaginae G. vaginalis L. crispatus L. gasseri L. iners L. jensenii L. vaginalis and total Lactobacillus and the mucin-desulfating sulfatase mdsC gene from P. bivia as previously described  .

Monocul- tures of commensal Lactobacillus crispatus Lactobacillus vaginalis Lactobacillus gas- seri Lactobacillus johnsonii Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus iners in addition to BV-associated organisms and Candida albicans were tested for their ability to uti- lize a representative group of prebiotics consisting of lactitol lactulose raffinose and oligofructose.

Raffinose elevated the maximal growths of L. crispatus P  0.0001 L. gasseri P  0.05 and L. vaginalis P  0.01 causing medium acidification only in L. vaginalis culture P  0.05 .

We showed that supplementation of bacterial monocul- tures with lactulose stimulated L. crispatus L. gasseri L. vaginalis and L. jensenii RC-28 while antagonizing C. albicans and A. vaginae indicating its ability to selectively propagate a range of commensals but not vaginal pathogens.

Lactulose increased the maximal growth of Lactobacillus crispatus P  0.0001 Lactobacillus gasseri P  0.05 Lactobacillus vaginalis P  0.01 and Lactobacillus jensenii RC-28 P  0.0001 com- pared to that in media without prebiotic .

Although lactitol only stimulated L. crispatus growth P  0.0001 acidic products were produced by both lactitol-inoculated L. crispatus P  0.001 and L. jensenii RC-28 P  0.05 .

However other researchers have observed that raffinose can be used by Trichomonas vaginalis  the vaginal parasite responsible fortrichomoniasis which further underscores the unsuitability of this compound as an effective vaginal health agent.Oligofructose was utilized by L. gasseri and L. jensenii 25258 in our study and by Lactobacillus acidophilus in a previous investigation .

Quantitative determination by real-time PCR of four vaginal Lactobacillus species Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between L. gasseri and L. iners.

Lactulose treatment also correspond- ingly lowered the pH compared to that in media without prebiotic for L. crispatus P  0.001 and L. jensenii RC-28 P  0.001 .
