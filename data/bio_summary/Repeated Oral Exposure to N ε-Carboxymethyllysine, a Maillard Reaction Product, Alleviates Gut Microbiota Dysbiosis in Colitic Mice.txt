Overall we show here that consumption of CML a surrogate for advanced glycation end-products has little impact on healthy gut microbiota but alleviates gut microbiota dysbiosis in DSS-treated mice only.

Using multivariate analyses atdifferent taxonomic levels only slight not statistically significant by ANOSIM differences in gut microbiota were found between control and CML mice gut microbiota at genus level Fig.

Relative abundance of mice gut microbiota composition at phylum level Bacteroidetes a Firmicutes b Actinobacteria c and Proteobacteria d Only taxa representing more than 0.001  of gut microbiota are considered.

Here we did not observe any impact of CML consumption on mice general health but it should be noted that the dose of CML used was 30 times lower than in the previous study being more representative of regular daily exposure and that the animals were fed a standard diet.We also report that repeated consumption of moderate amounts of CML has limited impact on the taxonomic composition of gut microbiota of normal healthy mice.

While Ne-carboxymethyllysine exposure failed to prevent the inflammatory response it allowed maintenance of healthy gut microbiota profiles in mice treated with DSS but not TNBS.Conclusions Repeated oral exposure to CML limits dys- biosis in experimental colitis.

In mice submitted to either DSS or TNBS repeated CML ingestion was unable to limit the inflammatory reaction 0.70 - 0.07 versus 0.77 - 0.07 Umg of proteins in DSS group and0.54 - 0.06 versus 0.64 - 0.07 Umg of proteins in TNBS group Table .Gut Microbiota AnalysesA total of 2102977 sequences from 123 samples 17097 - 10992 per sample were obtained.Impact of CML on Gut Microbiota of Healthy MiceAt phylum level CML consumption did not affect gut microbiota Fig.

1 Ne-Carboxymethyllysine CML consumption results in mod- est and inconsistent changes in healthy mice gut microbiota.

In contrast CML con- sumption significantly modulated gut microbiota towards the controlCML state with increased Firmicutes from 34 to 58  and decreased Bacteroidetes from 41 to 32  and Proteobacteria from 12 to 3 .On multivariate analysis at different taxonomic levels no difference was observed between control and CML mice exposed to TNBS colitis Fig.

2 DSS and TNBS experimental colitis resulted in dramatic and distinct alterations in healthy mice gut microbiota a. Microbiota data are shown on a nonmetric multidimensional scaling Bray-Curtis similarity index ANOSIM P  0.05 and as pie charts.
