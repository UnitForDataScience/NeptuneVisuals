laryngitis is chronic if symptoms persist for 3 weeks or greater.1 symptoms of chronic laryngitis include dysphonia globus sensation odynophagia and excessive throat clearing.23 etiologies for chronic laryngitis include laryngopharyngeal reflux lpr irritants cigarette smoke or inhaled medications rhinitis allergic or other mechanical irritation from voice misuseoveruse and infectious including bacterial laryngitis and laryngeal candidiasis.34 historically routine use of antibiotics to treat chronic laryngitis has not been recommended15 and chronic infectious laryngitis secondary to bacterial infection remains a poorly understood disease process.causative organisms have not been fully identified and optimal treatment regimens are unknown.

in a recent study biopsies were obtained from 44 benign vocal fold lesions.6 examination of the bacterial community by 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated 5 predominate genera including streptococcus fusobacterium prevotella neisseria and gemella.6 in another study examining the microbiome of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma the same genera were identified.78 staphylococcus was not identified in either of these studies.there are limited data available on chronic bacterial laryngitis with only a few reports of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa laryngitis in the literature.9-11 the largest case series included 3 cases of mrsa laryngitis and 3 cases of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus mssa laryngitis.11 these patients were dysphonic vocal roughness fatigue and decreased vocal endurance and had thickened vocal folds edema crusting and debris on exam.11 all 6 patients were diagnosed via in-office cultures and were treated with multiple courses 2-4 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.11 additionally there are a few case reports describing patients with prolonged dysphonia culture proven mrsa laryngitis and treatment with extended courses of trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole.910in our clinical population we observed a cohort of patients with symptoms of chronic laryngitis and evidence of significant laryngeal inflammation on laryngoscopy for whom initial treatments were unsuccessful.

one culture demonstrated only normal respiratory flora despite the larynx having the characteristic appearance of chronic bacterial laryngitis.thomas et al.page 11figure 3.representative laryngoscopy images of chronic laryngitis pre- and posttreatment.

a recent study demonstrated that otolaryngologists rarely treat chronic laryngitis with antibiotics as the first-line therapy preferring to start with a proton pump inhibitor ppi treating lpr as the presumed etiology.2as demonstrated by studies of the human microbiome the larynx is chronically colonized by bacteria.67 therefore chronic laryngitis from a bacterial infection could stem from bacterial species not part of the normal laryngeal microbiome or from an overgrowth of commensal bacteria.

the objectives of this retrospective chart review were to identify patients with chronic infectious laryngitis determine the associated organisms and comorbid conditions and review treatment regimens to develop greater understanding of this disease entity.thomas et al.page 3materials and methodswe performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients who underwent laryngeal biopsy for chronic laryngitis with a suspected infectious etiology january 2013-may 2016. this study was carried out under institutional review board approval.

the majority of patients had cultures positive for mssa 1215. chronic laryngitis secondary to bacterial infection may be underrecognized and should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with prolonged dysphonia especially if laryngeal crusting and exudate are present as these findings appear most indicative of bacterial infection.in cases of suspected bacterial infection a culture should be obtained.

cases of chronic dysphonia are heterogeneous so clinical judgement should always be used to determine the appropriate workup need to rule out malignancy or other underlying conditions and treatment.conclusionspatients presenting with persistent dysphonia and characteristic laryngoscopy findings of laryngeal inflammation could be biopsied for culture to assess for infectious laryngitis.

culture results demonstrated a predominance of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus as the causative organism for chronic laryngitis 1215. serratia marcescens was isolated from 2 cultures while pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were each isolated from 1 out of 15 cultures.

patient records including clinical notes operative reports culture results pathology results and recorded endoscopic exams were reviewed.initially laryngeal swabs were taken for culture however these were universally nondiagnostic.

one culture initially grew predominantly serratia marcescens with a few mssa but after successful treatment with a subsequent recurrence repeat culture demonstrated only mssa.

however the optimal treatment regimen has yet to be defined and will require larger prospective studies.keywordslaryngitis bacteria staphylococcus aureus inflammation chronic laryngitis infectious laryngitisreprints and permissions sagepub.comjournalspermissions.navcorresponding author matthew s. clary department of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery university of colorado school of medicine 12631 e 17th avenue b-205 aurora co 80045 usa.

chronic laryngitis was defined as persistent voice changes present for 3 weeks or greater.

eleven of the 15 patients were referred to infectious disease for evaluation.thomas et al.page 5discussionthis study describes a population of patients with chronic dysphonia plus laryngeal inflammation consisting of edema diffuse erythema crusting and exudate that can be attributed to pathogenic bacteria including mssa mrsa pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

it is possible that some cases of chronic laryngitis are due to fungal or afb infection and therefore biopsies should be sent for aerobic anaerobic fungal and afb cultures.
