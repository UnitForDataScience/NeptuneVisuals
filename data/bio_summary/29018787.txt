We applied the SAM method to capture change in OTU abundance from 3 to 12 months of age within each of the seven strata i vaginal birth breastfed by 3 months no antibiotic exposure during birth or by 3 months of age less disturbedii vaginal birth breastfed with antibiotic exposure iii vaginal birth not breastfed with antibiotic exposure iv vaginal birth not breastfed no antibiotic exposure v elective cesarean with antibiotic prophylaxis breastfed vi elective cesarean with antibiotic prophylaxis not breastfed and vii emergency cesar- ean breastfed.

The resultant number of OTUs per perinatal group was approximately 1000 as follows i vaginal breastfed and no antibiotic use 1124 OTUs ii vaginal breastfed and anti- biotic use 1111 OTUs iii vaginal not breastfed and antibio- tic use 995 OTUs iv vaginal not breastfed and no antibiotic use 1094 OTUs v elective CS breastfed and antibiotic use 1069 OTUs vi elective CS not breastfed and antibiotic use 918 OTUs and vii emergency CS breastfed and antibi- otic use 1067 OTUs.Data were visually represented as plots of SAM scores to show statistically significant changes in OTU relative abundance from 3 months to 1 year.

a For all infants n  166 pairs B infants delivered vaginally breastfed and not exposed to antibiotics n  71 pairs c infants delivered vaginally breastfed and exposed to antibiotics n  34 pairs D infants delivered vaginally not breastfed and exposed to antibiotics n  8 pairs e infants delivered vaginally not breastfed and not exposed to antibiotics n  17 pairs F infants delivered by elective cesarean section breastfed and exposed to antibiotics n  13 pairs g infants delivered by elective cesarean section not breastfed and exposed to antibiotics n  3 pairs and h infants delivered by emergency cesarean section breastfed and exposed to antibiotics n  16 pairs.The proportion of unchanged OTU abundance rose further to 68 in vaginally delivered and formula-fed infants who had not been exposed to antibiotics.

Also in these 2 groups of infants a greater propor- tion of Bacteroidetes OTUs were unchanged and much fewer Bacteroidetes species increased their abundance.Family level changes according to the saM scoreAccording to the maximum SAM score for OTU increase or decrease perinatal exposure groups were ranked from highest to lowest scores as follows  breastfed after vaginal birth withwithout antibiotic treatment breastfed after cesarean delivery and not breastfed after vaginal birth with without antibiotics.
