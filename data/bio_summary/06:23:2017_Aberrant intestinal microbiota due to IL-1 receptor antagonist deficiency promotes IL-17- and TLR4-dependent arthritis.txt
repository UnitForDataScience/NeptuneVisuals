a-c production of il-1b il-23 and il-6 by si-lp mononuclear cells of il1rn-- and il1rn-- tlr4-- mice cultured in the presence of autoclaved il1rn-- complete fecal microbial antigens for 24 h. d-f cytokine production by si-lp lymphocytes of separately housed il1rn-- and il1rn-- tlr4-- mice ex vivo stimulated with pma and ionomycin for 5 h. g-i cytokine production by si-lp lymphocytes of il1rn-- and il1rn-- tlr4-- mice co-housed for 10 days.

stimulation of lpmononuclear cells of these co-housed mice with fecal microbial antigens confirmed that cells from il1rn-- tlr4-- mice produce lower amounts of il-1b il-23 and il-6 regardless of stimulation with il1rn-- or il1rn-- tlr4-- microbiota additional file figure s9.these data suggest that tlr4 activation contributes to intestinal lp production of ifng and most notably il-17 and these effects precede the onset of arthritis.importantly production of il-17 but not ifng in lymph nodes draining the inflamed joints was dimin- ished in il1rn-- tlr4-- mice compared with il1rn-- mice additional file figure s10.

furthermore co-housing with wt mice did not affect the development of arthritis in il1rn-- mice not shown.potentiated th17 response and spontaneous arthritis in il1rn-- mice highly depend on the presence of commensal microbiotato determine whether the increase in intestinal th17 cells and spontaneous arthritis in il1rn-- mice depends on commensal microbiota we established gf il1rn-- mice.

importantly loss of intestinal microbial diversity and richness also coincides with human autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis  among the microbiota increased in il1rn-- mice streptococcus species are known inducers of chronic tlr-mediated arthritis in animal models when injected intra-articularly furthermore a commensal helicobacter h. hepaticus has been shown to induce il-23 and mediatet cell-dependent gut inflammation in immunocom- promised mice the decreased barnesiella in il1rn-- mice is consistent with a previous study associatingthe abundance of barnesiella with resistance to arthritis in hla-drb10402 mice a specific species of prevotella p. copri is overrepresented in patients with new-onset ra and was recently shown to increase colonic th17 cells and promote arthritis in skg mice after co-exposure to the fungal component zymosan on the other hand p. histicola has been reported to suppress collagen-induced arthritis in transgenic mice expressing ra-susceptibility gene hla-dq8 therefore the immunomodulatory effects of the gut microbiota including prevotella are species- and some- times even strain-dependent.

it should also be noted that fecal bacterial community structures do not fully mirror the site-specific luminal or mucosa- associated microbiota profiles and were used in this study as a proxy of the gut microbiota of the il1rn-- mice.our previous studies showed that il1rn-- tlr2-- mice develop a more severe arthritis compared with il1rn-- mice given that additional tlr2 defi- ciency did not affect the microbiota of il1rn-- mice to a major extent fig.

the pathogenic relevance of il-17 in the de- velopment of arthritis in il1rn-- mice has been demon- strated before since both il-17 gene deficiency and treatment with neutralizing anti-il-17 antibodies inhibit arthritis a previous study showed that gd t cells rather than th17 cells represent most il-17-producing t cells in the inflamed joints of il1rn-- mice while gd17 and th17 cells may have complementary pathogenic roles in the development of il1rn-- arth- ritis our data suggest that il-17-producing cells located in lamina propria and induced by il1rn-- intestinal microbiota are tcrb-expressing cd4 th17 cells fig.

flow cytometry ana- lysis of lamina propria cells of wt and il1rn-- mice verified a significant clear increase of il-17-producing tcrb cd4 cells in il1rn-- mice while tcrb- cellsin lp produced similar amounts of il-17 in wt and il1rn-- mice additional file figure s4.

in total 11 out of44 taxa significantly altered in il1rn-- mice were normalized toward the wt levels in il1rn-- tlr4-- mice additional file  table s2.we next examined the role of tlr4 in the mucosal t cell response in il1rn-- mice.

to verify microbiota of conventional il1rn-- mice can trig- ger arthritis gf il1rn-- mice received either 200 ml of sterile water or 200 ml fecal suspensions of conventional il1rn-- mice and were monitored for the development of arthritis for 8 weeks.

th17 cells require trans- forming growth factor-b and il-6 plus il-1b in mouse for initial differentiation and il-23 for their functional maturation and pathogenic function to deter- mine the role of tlr4 in response to il1rn-- intestinalmicrobial antigens we cultured si-lp mononuclear cells from il1rn-- and il1rn-- tlr4-- mice ex vivo with autoclaved il1rn-- intestinal microbiota.

strikingly mi- crobial composition of il1rn-- and il1rn-- tlr2-- mice were indistinguishable while il1rn-- tlr4-- mice formed another distinct cluster fig.

d. this strongly suggests that the skewed intestinal t cell balance in il1rn-- mice is largely microbiota dependent.in agreement with il-17-dependence of il1rn-- arth- ritis and in line with our previous observations gf il1rn-- mice showed a clear sustained protec- tion from arthritis with on average 3 weeks delay in dis- ease onset fig.

in addition transfer of conventional il1rn-- microbiota to gf il1rn-- mice re-induced arthritis and resulted in a severe disease comparable to that in conventional il1rn-- mice additional file figure s5.

these observationsimply a significant role for tlr4 in intestinal production of the cytokines involved in lp th17 differentiation in il1rn-- mice.when cultured ex vivo with pma and ionomycin si-lp cells from il1rn-- tlr4-- mice produced signifi- cantly less il-17 compared with cells from il1rn-- tlr4 mice before the onset of arthritis p  0.0028 fig.
