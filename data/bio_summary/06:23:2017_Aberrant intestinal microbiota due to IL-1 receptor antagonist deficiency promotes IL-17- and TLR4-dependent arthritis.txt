a-c Production of IL-1b IL-23 and IL-6 by SI-LP mononuclear cells of IL1rn-- and IL1rn-- Tlr4-- mice cultured in the presence of autoclaved IL1rn-- complete fecal microbial antigens for 24 h. d-f Cytokine production by SI-LP lymphocytes of separately housed IL1rn-- and IL1rn-- Tlr4-- mice ex vivo stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 5 h. g-i Cytokine production by SI-LP lymphocytes of IL1rn-- and IL1rn-- Tlr4-- mice co-housed for 10 days.

Stimulation of LPmononuclear cells of these co-housed mice with fecal microbial antigens confirmed that cells from IL1rn-- Tlr4-- mice produce lower amounts of IL-1b IL-23 and IL-6 regardless of stimulation with IL1rn-- or IL1rn-- Tlr4-- microbiota Additional file Figure S9.These data suggest that TLR4 activation contributes to intestinal LP production of IFNg and most notably IL-17 and these effects precede the onset of arthritis.Importantly production of IL-17 but not IFNg in lymph nodes draining the inflamed joints was dimin- ished in IL1rn-- Tlr4-- mice compared with IL1rn-- mice Additional file Figure S10.

Furthermore co-housing with WT mice did not affect the development of arthritis in IL1rn-- mice not shown.Potentiated Th17 response and spontaneous arthritis in IL1rn-- mice highly depend on the presence of commensal microbiotaTo determine whether the increase in intestinal Th17 cells and spontaneous arthritis in IL1rn-- mice depends on commensal microbiota we established GF IL1rn-- mice.

Importantly loss of intestinal microbial diversity and richness also coincides with human autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis  Among the microbiota increased in IL1rn-- mice Streptococcus species are known inducers of chronic TLR-mediated arthritis in animal models when injected intra-articularly Furthermore a commensal Helicobacter H. hepaticus has been shown to induce IL-23 and mediateT cell-dependent gut inflammation in immunocom- promised mice The decreased Barnesiella in IL1rn-- mice is consistent with a previous study associatingthe abundance of Barnesiella with resistance to arthritis in HLA-DRB10402 mice A specific species of Prevotella P. copri is overrepresented in patients with new-onset RA and was recently shown to increase colonic Th17 cells and promote arthritis in SKG mice after co-exposure to the fungal component zymosan On the other hand P. histicola has been reported to suppress collagen-induced arthritis in transgenic mice expressing RA-susceptibility gene HLA-DQ8 Therefore the immunomodulatory effects of the gut microbiota including Prevotella are species- and some- times even strain-dependent.

The pathogenic relevance of IL-17 in the de- velopment of arthritis in IL1rn-- mice has been demon- strated before since both IL-17 gene deficiency and treatment with neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibodies inhibit arthritis A previous study showed that gd T cells rather than Th17 cells represent most IL-17-producing T cells in the inflamed joints of IL1rn-- mice While gd17 and Th17 cells may have complementary pathogenic roles in the development of IL1rn-- arth- ritis our data suggest that IL-17-producing cells located in lamina propria and induced by IL1rn-- intestinal microbiota are TCRb-expressing CD4 Th17 cells Fig.

Flow cytometry ana- lysis of lamina propria cells of WT and IL1rn-- mice verified a significant clear increase of IL-17-producing TCRb CD4 cells in IL1rn-- mice while TCRb- cellsin LP produced similar amounts of IL-17 in WT and IL1rn-- mice Additional file Figure S4.

In total 11 out of44 taxa significantly altered in IL1rn-- mice were normalized toward the WT levels in IL1rn-- Tlr4-- mice Additional file  Table S2.We next examined the role of TLR4 in the mucosal T cell response in IL1rn-- mice.

It should also be noted that fecal bacterial community structures do not fully mirror the site-specific luminal or mucosa- associated microbiota profiles and were used in this study as a proxy of the gut microbiota of the Il1rn-- mice.Our previous studies showed that IL1rn-- Tlr2-- mice develop a more severe arthritis compared with IL1rn-- mice Given that additional TLR2 defi- ciency did not affect the microbiota of IL1rn-- mice to a major extent Fig.

To verify microbiota of conventional IL1rn-- mice can trig- ger arthritis GF IL1rn-- mice received either 200 ml of sterile water or 200 ml fecal suspensions of conventional IL1rn-- mice and were monitored for the development of arthritis for 8 weeks.
