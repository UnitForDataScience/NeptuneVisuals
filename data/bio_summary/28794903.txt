Interestingly enough the teabags of ice plant powder in particular those of 4 g L-1 proved to be appropriate and rather practical B.The use of the plant-based-sea water culture media for in situ recovery of the halotolerant microbiome of tested halophytesCompared to the chemically-synthetic CCM culture medium supplemented with 3 NaCl the plant-based-sea water culture media supported well-developed CFUs of halotolerant bacteriaFig.

The medium was used as such CCM or amended with NaCl 30 g L-1 513 mM identified as CCM30.Plant-based-sea water culture media Plant juice culture mediaThe mature juicy shoots leaves and stems of H. strobilaceumcrystallinum M. forsskaolii or S. pruinosa were sliced and blended for 5 min in a Waring blender with the least possible amounts of sea water except for M. crystallinum where no water was added because of its very juice nature.

As to culture media the plant-based-sea water culture medium enriched with either juice or plant powder-teabags of ice plant were as good as the chemically-synthetic CCM culture media and in most cases recov- ered the highest culturable bacterial population.Microbiological examination of surface sterilized roots Bi.e.

Specific root length SRL was assessed as well SRL  Root length cmRoot weight g.Statistical analysisAnalysis of Variance ANOVA and Fisher's Least Significance Difference LSD were carried out using STATISTICA v10 Statsoft OK USA.ResultsIn vitro growth of pure isolates of halotolerant rhizobacteria on the plant-based-sea water culture mediaPreliminary experiments examined the possible preparation of culture media exclusively based on the crude juices andor pow- ders of tested plants H. strobilaceum S. pruinosa M. forsskaolii and M. crystallinum.

In general the growth index of bacterial isolates measured on the plant-based-sea water culture media was good enough and very much comparable to the standard culture medium CCM with or without salt amendment.

Again the tested plant- based-sea water culture media recovered culturable endophytes with densities very much comparable if not exceeding to those developed on the salt-amended chemically-synthetic culture med- ium CCM.The bacterial load of the aerial parts i.e.

This is a strong indication on the capacity together with practicability of the introduced plant-based-sea water culture media to significantly increase cul- turability and recoverability of the in situ microbiome of tested halophytes.Characterization and identification of representative halotolerant bacterial isolates secured from various spheres of tested halophytesOne hundred forty-six isolates representing phyllosphere 43 isolates ecto-rhizosphere 47 isolates and endo-rhizosphere 56 isolates of the tested halophilic xerophytes were single-colony isolated from CFUs developed on various tested culture media.

The crude plant juices as such or diluted with sea water juice diluted 110 120 and 140 with sea water vv were tested as liquid culture media.

This included CCM amended with NaCl CCM30 and plant-based-sea water culture media of various concentrations of plant juices juice diluted 110 120 and 140 with sea water v v and plant powder 2 g L-1 and 4 g L-1.
