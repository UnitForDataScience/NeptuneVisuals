however the composi- tion of the microbial communities present in these soils and the framework that shapes their community development have yet to be explored.we hypothesize that within the soil microbial community there will be a variety of responses to elevation due to the com- plexity of environmental change with climate along this ele- vation gradient and the ecological diversity of microbial taxa.

these results show that microbial responses to climate gradients are heterogeneous due to complexity of underlying environmental changes and the diverse ecologies of microbial taxa.keywords biogeochemistry climate change elevation diversity productivity hawai'i ph soil climosequenceintroductionenvironmental gradients have been instrumental in develop- ing hypotheses about the ecological and evolutionary factors controlling biodiversity pianka  chown and gaston .

the inconsistent responses to elevation in the microbial literature and across tax- onomic groups in our study suggests that other environmental factors likely play important roles in controlling the diversity of soil microbial communities.

here weshow that there are strong changes in diversity and composi- tion of microbes in three domains of microbial life along a trop- ical environmental gradient and that climate change likely will impact microbial communities primarily through its effects on soil properties and biogeochemistry.

experiments to tease apart the relative importance of equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms chesson  levine and hillerislambers  in maintaining microbial alpha-diversity would be a promising area for future research.the microbial role in nutrient cyclingthe changes in microbial community composition that we ob- serve occur in tandem with large changes in the availability of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon among other elements.

for example at the broadest taxonomic scale we expected that bacteria would respond most strongly to soil ph fungi to soil carbon concentrations and archaea to ph and nitrogen availability.methodssitesfield sites were located along a transect on the leeward slope of kohala volcano on the island of hawai'i 20.15 n -155.8 wwhere topsoils developed in parent material of the ca.

while fungi bacteria and archaea responded strongly to these coupled changes in climate and soil processes across the gradi-ent analyzed there were also important differences in the direc- tion of change between taxonomic groups and the importance of specific soil variables.

and the increase in fun- gal richness at higher soil carbon concentration may be linked with a greater diversity of soil carbon niche axes.
