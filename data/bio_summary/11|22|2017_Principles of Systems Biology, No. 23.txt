Finally using programmable prions more complex synthetic devices or memories could be engineered.428 Cell Systems 5 November 22 2017 a 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.Cell SystemsCell Systems CallToward Living Fabrication of Structured MaterialsYangxiaolu Cao and Lingchong You Duke UniversityPrinciplesNature is a master in fabricating structured materials consisting of living and non-living components from the bottom up but such processes are not readily programmable.

In spite of this established methods to design new proteins for biotech- nological applications have focused on the creation of sequences that stably adopt a single structure ignoring the potential for dynamics to facilitate function and create complex functionalities.We developed a computational method for the rational design of protein dynamics called meta-multistate design which we used to create proteins that undergo sponta- neous exchange between two target struc- tures.

the framework is a fundamental step toward a quantitative and predictive understanding of gene-cir- cuit behavior.What's NextThe framework will benefit from considering circuit dynamics in complex physiological states and different host organisms.

In addition this circuit platform has the poten- tial to be adapted to study tumor immu- nology and to treat other type of diseases that require highly specific and localized immunomodulation.Cell Systems 5 November 22 2017 429Cell SystemsCell Systems CallWatching the Dynamics of Evolution over 60000 GenerationsBenjamin H.

These modules may be used for building more complex signal-processing systems and the two-layer design strategy enables assembly of 3D structured materials that have well-defined physical and chemical properties.A fundamental bottleneck is the still-limited capability of programming more-sophis- ticated spatial patterns in a predictable manner using gene circuits.What's NextOur work opens up several future possibil- ities in fundamental engineering design and potential applications.

Quantitative modeling is a natural choice for addressing the challenge but its current ''standard'' scheme which treats circuits as isolated entities is oversimplified often resulting in difficulties quantitatively describing circuit behaviors.We recently constructed a gene-circuit modeling framework that explicitly inte- grates circuit dynamics with host physiology Liao et al.

The circuits' cancer-targeting specificity was examined with cytotoxicity assays in vitro and therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in vivo using a disseminated ovarian cancer mouse model.This Trojan horse-like approach has the potential to overcome key limitations in current immunotherapies such as non-specific target- ing of normal cells tumor- mediated immunosuppres- sion and toxicities due to the systemic delivery of immunomodulatorsWhat's NextSteps toward further clinical translation include designing optimized promoters for tumor targeting in human patients identi- fying clinically relevant output combinations in additional tumor models including hu- manized and syngeneic mouse models and optimizing circuit delivery in vivo.

Further theoretical work will be required to integrate these eco-evolutionary dynamics into a popula- tion genetic framework.
