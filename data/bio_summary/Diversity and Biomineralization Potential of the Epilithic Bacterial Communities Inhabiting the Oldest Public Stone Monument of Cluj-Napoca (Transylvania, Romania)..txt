We considered thatFIGURE 5  Scanning electron microscopy photomicrographs of A calcium carbonate precipitate CaCO3 induced by Stenotrophomonas chelatiphaga on M-3 agar medium B detail of calcified S. chelatiphaga cells bc forming tubular vaterite structures growing from the calcium carbonate matrix CaCO3 C detail of Bacillus licheniformis cells bc attached to a calcium carbonate matrix CaCO3 D transversal section of a calcium carbonate crust showing B. pumilus cells and a porous calcium carbonate matrix CaCO3 which presents cavities left by the embedment of bacterial cells during carbonatogenesis E B. pumilus cells and vaterite crystals CaCO3 F Exopolysaccharide EPS film formed by Streptomyces albidoflavus grown on M-3 agar medium.the affinity of vaterite nanoparticles to bacterial cell walls may be induced by electrostatic and stereochemical interactions at the inorganic-organic interface and by media supersaturation in the manner described by .Although bacteria have the capacity to induce the formation of different calcium carbonate polymorphs vaterite aragonite and calcite the reasons underlying their selection are not well understood and believed to be linked to metabolic activity cell wall characteristics extracellular polymeric substances and growth media composition  .

The SEM imaging also indicated that the carbonate crystals were formed by the interaction of bacteria with their growth media and that they acted as nucleation sites for CaCO3 precipitation leading to their entrapment and formation of calcium carbonate alveoles  .
