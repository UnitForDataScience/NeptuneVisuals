Taken together our study demonstrated that gut microbiota was actively involved in the pathological process of 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis suggesting potential attenuation of 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis by manipulating gut microbiota homeostasis.Keywords gut microbiota 5-fluorouracil intestinal mucositis inflammatory chemokinescytokines fecal transplantationINTRODUCTIONGastrointestinal microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of human health Figlewicz 2008 Zhao 2013 Patel et al.

2009 to induce mucositis the 5-Fu group mice were intraperitoneally administered with 5-Fu 50 mgkg once daily for 3 days.

Both 5-Fu group and 5-Fufeces group mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-Fu 50 mgkgday for 3 days.

By contrast the colon length of 5-Fu treated mice was significantly shortened Figures 1EF P  0.001 and the cecum of 5-Fu treated mice seemed to be smaller Figure 1E.

Moreover 5-Fu treatment injured mucosal epithelium and disrupted crypt-villus structures which was accompanied with enhance cellular infiltration HE staining and neutrophil MPO staining infiltration Figures 1GH.5-Fu Altered Inflammatory Cytokine and Chemokine ProfilesAlthough previous studies exposed the alteration of several inflammatory factors in 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis Justino et al.

In terms of mRNA expression of the cytokineschemokines 5-Fu treatment induced the mRNAFIGURE 1  5-Fu induced mucositis and colon shortening in mice.

However 5-Fu increased theFIGURE 4  5-Fu activated NF-kB and MAPK signaling pathways in colonic tissues.

In another experiment to assess the effect of fecal microbiota on 5-Fu induced colonic mucositis the vancomycin-pretreated mice were transplanted with feces from Control and 5-Fu group mice respectively.

These results implicated that disturbed gut microbiota contributed to the induction of intestinal mucositis in 5-Fu treated mice.DISCUSSIONAlthough previous studies have indicated that gut microbiota plays an important role in 5-Fu induced gastrointestinal mucositis Stringer et al.

In agreement with the report in our study enhanced phosphorylation of NF- kB and MAPK pathway molecules were also found in colonic tissue of 5-Fu treated mice indicating their active participation in regulating expression of tight junction proteins and colonic proinflammatory cytokineschemokines in the pathogenesis of 5-Fu induced colonic mucositis.Disturbed gut microbiota in either diversity or abundance has been found to play an important role in the pathological development of inflammatory bowel diseases Juste et al.
