In order to analyse the microbial populations the unsterilized native soil were used a total of four soil four maize root and one natural farming soil samples such as CK-unsterilized natural farming field soil T1S- uninoculated soil T2S-Soil inoculated with T. har- zianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 T3S-Soli inoculated with FG T4S-Soil inoculated with T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 and FG T1R Maize root samples collected from uninoculated soil pot T2R maize root col- lected from soil inoculated with T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 T3R- Maize root samples collected from inoculated with FG pot T4R- Maize root samples collected from inoculated with T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 and FG were subjected to the pyrosequencing experiments.

Based on the previous in vitro antagonis- tic assay a total of 10 Trichoderma strains Trichoderma asperellum CCTCC-SBW0102 T3 T. aureoviride CCTCC-SBW0005 T9 T. harzianum CCTCC-SBW0101 T11 T. asperellum CCTCC-SBW0109 T12 T. atro- viride CCTCC-SBW0016 T21 T. asperellum CCTCC-SBW0052 T43 T. asperellum CCTCC-SBW0091 T44T.

For T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 colonization analysis T1- Natural farming soil not inoculated with any microbes and amended with 10 vermiculite T2-Natural farming soil inoc- ulated with T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 T72 and amended with 10 vermiculite T3- Natural farming soil inoculated with FG and amended with 10 Vermiculate T4- Natural farming soil inoculated T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 T72 and FG and amended with 10 Vermiculate.

In order to determine the fun- gal colonization in the maize root the ITS copies of T. harzianum CCTCC-RW0024 and FG were deter- mined using RT-qPCR by designing specific primers for T. harzianum CCTCC-RW0024 ITS spacer TH-F 5'-GCATTTCGCTGCGTTCTTCA-3' ITS spacer TH-R 5'-TAATCTGAGCCTTCTCGGCG-3' FG IT S sp acer FG-F 5 ' -GAGGGT TGAAATGAC GCTC G-3 '  and IT S sp acer FG-R 5'-ACGGATCTCTTGGTTCTGGC-3' colonization was determined in all the four treatments.For the RT-qPCR assay three plant roots were randomly collected from each treatment.

Thus T4 showed that T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 significantly reduced the infection of FG as evident by 86.66 diseases reduction and increased plant growth.Quantitative analysis of T. harzianum strain CCTCC-RW0024 in maize roots.
