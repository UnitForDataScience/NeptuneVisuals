this indicated that the strain cctcc-rw0024 could significantly reduce the colonization of fg and its infections in maize seedlings.exogenous application of t. harzianum on the maize rhizosphere microbiomes.

in addition this work indicated that inoculation of t. harzianum strain cctcc-rw0024 in infected maize field could control stalk rot through different mechanisms or composite mechanisms including mycoparasitism isr the increment of the maize rhizosphere microbiome and soil fertil- ity.
