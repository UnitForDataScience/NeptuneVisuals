within antibiotics a stronger association with bsi was observed with broad-spectrum antibiotics ahr 2.44 95 ci 2.00-2.96 compared with narrow-spectrumantibiotics ahr 1.70 95 ci 1.36-2.13.sensitivity analysesthe relationship between ppis and bsi remained unchanged when we performed a restriction analysis of 22776 patients who survived until icu discharge or the development of bsi ahr 1.04 95 ci 0.86-1.27. results of a fine-gray analysis were similar ahr 1.11 95 ci 0.93-1.34. there was also no difference whentable 1. baseline demographics and characteristics at time of icu admission stratified by exposure to ppis characteristicsall n 14 24774no ppis n 14 10134ppis n 14 14640p valuerace0-2 points14609 596485 648124 55.013 points10165 413649 366516 45comorbiditieschronic pulmonary disorders9189 373296 335893 40.01diabetes mellitus6156 252373 233783 26.01renal failure9475 383265 326210 42.01malignancy3996 161515 152481 17.01aresidence before hospitalization in long-term care facility.we focused on the sickest patients by excluding 9738 patients with less than 2 serious medical comorbidities at the time of icu admission ahr 0.96 95 ci 0.79-1.18. among patients who received at least a single dose of a ppi 88 received ppis for more than 50 of icu days.

when patients who received ppis for 50 of icu days were excluded there was no association be- tween ppis and bsi ahr 1.13 95 ci 0.94-1.35.when ppis were examined as a time-varying exposure there was no association with bsi ahr 1.16 95 ci 0.97-1.39. there was no interaction between ppis and either broad-spectrum antibiotics p .92 or narrow- spectrum antibiotics p .39. there was also no sig- nificant association between ppis and bsi when we analyzed only 203 bsis that were derived from pre- dominantly enteric bacteria ahr 1.35 95 ci 0.94-1.95. finally there was no association between ppis and vap adjusted odds ratio 1.16 95 ci 0.97-1.39  or ppis and all-cause mortality ahr 1.01 95 ci 0.92-1.10.discussionuse of ppis for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the icu was not associated with increased risk for bsi and this null finding was robust through multiple sensitivity analyses.if the relationship between ppis and bsi was mediated by ppi-induced changes in intestinal permeability one might expect that ppis would increase risk for bsi from enteric but not from non-enteric bacteria.

the cumulative incidence of bsi was 3.7 in patients with ppi exposure compared with 2.2 in patients without ppi exposure log-rank test p  .01. after adjusting for potential confounders ppi exposure was not associated with increased risk of bsi while in the icu adjusted hazard ratio 1.08 95 confidence interval 0.91-1.29. comorbid- ities antibiotic use and mechanical ventilation were all independently associated with increased risk for bsis.conclusionsin a retrospective study of patients in the icu administration of ppis to prevent bleeding was not associated with increased risk of bsi.

animal and human studies have shown higher intestinal permeability with slower rates of mucosal healing in the critically ill leading to increased risk for bacterial translocation and infec- tion.because most of the data connecting ppis and extraintestinal infections are derived from cirrhotictable 2. characteristics during treatment in icu stratified by exposure to ppispeg percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.patients the differences between this study and prior studies may indicate that icu patients have relatively preserved intestinal permeability compared with cirrhotic patients and that bsi in icu patients usually arises through alternate pathways.

this repository was then queried for relevant outcome and exposure-related data.study populationadult patients  18 years were eligible for the study if they were admitted to any 1 of 14 distinct icus within a hospital network composed of 3 large hospitals be- tween 2008 and 2014. patients were excluded if they had an icu length of stay less than 2 days if they were diagnosed with bsi before day 3 of their icu stay to distinguish prevalent from incident bsi or if they had gi bleeding during the index hospitalization identified by appropriate international classification of diseases ninth revision icd-9 codes.

these findings indicate that concern for bsi should not affect decisions regarding use of ppis in the icu.keywords acid suppression intestinal permeability critical care bacteremia.here are 600000 bacterial bloodstream infections bsis annually in the united states more than 75000 of which result in death.bsis are particularly lethal when acquired in the intensive care unit icueffectivealthough incidence and mortality from bsis in the icu remain high.with a case mortality rate greater than 40 a 15-20 absolute increase above baseline icu mortality.estab- lished risk factors for bsi in the icu include increased age multiple comorbidities and immunosuppression.

along with previous studies these data suggest that ppis do not meaningfully alter clinical outcomes with respect to some of the most important icu infections bsis vap or clostridium difficile infection.in the icu setting any effects of ppis may simply be too subtle or too short- lived to exert a downstream effect on risk for bsi or other infections.receipt of both narrow- and broad-spectrum antibi- otics in the icu was associated with increased risk for bsi with a stronger association observed for broad- than narrow-spectrum antibiotics.

multivariable cox proportional hazards modeling was used to test the association between ppis and bsi after controlling for patient comorbidities and other clinical factors.resultswe analyzed data from 24774 patients in the icu including 756 patients 3.1 who devel- oped bsis while in the icu.

the final multivariable analysis was performed by using a cox proportional hazards model with patients followed from the time of icu admission until death icu discharge or for 28 total days ie from day 2 until day 30 after icu admission.

when tested in the final model exposure to h2ras in the icu was also not significantly associated with bsi ahr 1.01 95 ci 0.74-1.38. increased comorbidities use of mechanical ventilation and receipt of narrow- and broad-spectrum antibiotics were independently associated with bsi in the icu.

the mortality rate during the index icu admission was 19 among patients who developed bsis compared with 7.7 among patients who did not develop bsis p  .01. the incidence rate of bsis was similar throughout the 7 years of the study p for trend 14 .26.characteristics at baseline and during treatment in the intensive care unitpatients who received prophylaxis with ppis were older more likely to be male and more likely to have received a solid organ transplant and had increased baseline comorbidities compared with patients who did not receive ppis .

during treatment in the icu patients who received ppis were more likely to receive antibiotics and other interventions compared with patients who did not receive ppis .multivariable modelthe cumulative proportion of bsis was 3.7 in pa- tients exposed to ppis versus 2.2 in patients who were not exposed to ppis log-rank test p  .01 .

most notably ppis have been associated with increased risk for bsis and for other infections in cirrhotic patients.like cirrhotic patients critically ill patients have crucial risk factors for bsi that may be affected by ppis including increased intestinal perme- abilityand loss of normal diversity in the gi micro- biome.data investigating the relationship between ppis and risk for bsi are limited.

these patients are at risk for bloodstream infections bsis so we investigated the relationship between ppi use and bsis among patients in the icu.methodswe performed a retrospective cohort study of adults 18 years admitted to 1 of 14 icus within a hospital network of 3 large hospitals from 2008 through 2014. the primary exposure was ppi use for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the icu.
