Characteristics During Treatment in ICU Stratified by Exposure to PPIsPEG percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.patients the differences between this study and prior studies may indicate that ICU patients have relatively preserved intestinal permeability compared with cirrhotic patients and that BSI in ICU patients usually arises through alternate pathways.

These findings indicate that concern for BSI should not affect decisions regarding use of PPIs in the ICU.Keywords Acid Suppression Intestinal Permeability Critical Care Bacteremia.here are 600000 bacterial bloodstream infections BSIs annually in the United States more than 75000 of which result in death.BSIs are particularly lethal when acquired in the intensive care unit ICUeffectivealthough incidence and mortality from BSIs in the ICU remain high.with a case mortality rate greater than 40 a 15-20 absolute increase above baseline ICU mortality.Estab- lished risk factors for BSI in the ICU include increased age multiple comorbidities and immunosuppression.

Along with previous studies these data suggest that PPIs do not meaningfully alter clinical outcomes with respect to some of the most important ICU infections BSIs VAP or Clostridium difficile infection.In the ICU setting any effects of PPIs may simply be too subtle or too short- lived to exert a downstream effect on risk for BSI or other infections.Receipt of both narrow- and broad-spectrum antibi- otics in the ICU was associated with increased risk for BSI with a stronger association observed for broad- than narrow-spectrum antibiotics.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to test the association between PPIs and BSI after controlling for patient comorbidities and other clinical factors.RESULTSWe analyzed data from 24774 patients in the ICU including 756 patients 3.1 who devel- oped BSIs while in the ICU.

Within antibiotics a stronger association with BSI was observed with broad-spectrum antibiotics aHR 2.44 95 CI 2.00-2.96 compared with narrow-spectrumantibiotics aHR 1.70 95 CI 1.36-2.13.Sensitivity AnalysesThe relationship between PPIs and BSI remained unchanged when we performed a restriction analysis of 22776 patients who survived until ICU discharge or the development of BSI aHR 1.04 95 CI 0.86-1.27.

The final multivariable analysis was performed by using a Cox proportional hazards model with patients followed from the time of ICU admission until death ICU discharge or for 28 total days ie from day 2 until day 30 after ICU admission.

Patients were excluded if they had an ICU length of stay less than 2 days if they were diagnosed with BSI before day 3 of their ICU stay to distinguish prevalent from incident BSI or if they had GI bleeding during the index hospitalization identified by appropriate International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision ICD-9 codes.

During treatment in the ICU patients who received PPIs were more likely to receive antibiotics and other interventions compared with patients who did not receive PPIs .Multivariable ModelThe cumulative proportion of BSIs was 3.7 in pa- tients exposed to PPIs versus 2.2 in patients who were not exposed to PPIs log-rank test P  .01 .
