Inflammation involves interaction between various immune cells inflammatory cells chemokines cytokines and pro- inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase COX and lipoxygenase LOX pathways which may lead to signalling towards tumour cell proliferation growth and invasion whereas nitric oxide NO has been associated with metastasis apoptosis and angiogenesis.

During EMT process structures involved in epithelial cell-cell interaction such as tight junc- tions adherens junctions desmosomes and gap junctions are lost and the cells undergo actin cytoskeleton reorganisation and changes in the mesenchymal phenotype expression profile of proteins allowing for cell-cell contact such as E-cadherin with an expression of fibroblast markers invasiveness and metasta- sis of tumour cells including fibronectin -smooth muscle actin -SMA and matrix metalloproteinases orchestrating by a vari- ety of transcription factors such as Snail ZEB and the helix- loop-helix HLH family Xu et al.

Israels and Israels  documented that the overexpression of COX-2 in intestinal epithelial cells causes phenotypic changes that may enhance the tumourigenic or metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells with altered activities of caspase-9 caspase-3 and PARP leading in turn to the degradation of DNA into nucleosomal fragments with different mechanis- tic pathways like p53 Fas tumour necrosis factor a and death receptor NO plays immense role in inducing apop- tosis through different complex mechanisms.
