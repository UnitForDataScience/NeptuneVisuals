inflammation involves interaction between various immune cells inflammatory cells chemokines cytokines and pro- inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase cox and lipoxygenase lox pathways which may lead to signalling towards tumour cell proliferation growth and invasion whereas nitric oxide no has been associated with metastasis apoptosis and angiogenesis.
