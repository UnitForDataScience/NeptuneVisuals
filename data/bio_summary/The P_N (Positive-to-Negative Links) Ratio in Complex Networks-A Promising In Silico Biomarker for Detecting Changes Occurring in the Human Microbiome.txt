From the SCN the PN ratio is computed with PNRatio.r program.Formally as illustrated in the following flowchart our computational procedures for implementing the PN ratio methodology consist of the following four steps see theTable 1The datasets utilized to develop and test the PN ratio analysis programMicrobiome SiteAssociated DiseaseTreatmentsReferenceGutHIVHIV Negative 20 vs. Non-ART 20 ART 20McHardy et al.

Therefore identifying new network properties that can capture the difference between positive and negative corre- lations is likely to remedy the insufficiency of standard correla- tion network analysis in analyzing the microbiome network and to offer a potentially powerful tool for detecting the changes occurred in the diseased microbiome.We postulate that the simple counts of the positive and negative links in the microbiome species correlation network is likely to offer us such an apparatus for remedying some of the above described issues of standard correlation network anal- ysis.

It is the magnitude of the PN ratio change rather than the direction of change in a specific disease-microbiome regime that makes the PN ratio useful for detect- ing the disease-induced change in the specific microbiome.DiscussionIn the previous section we first illustrated the limitation of the standard correlation network analysis in detecting the disease- associated changes in the human microbiome.

In either case the PN ratio should be a 'thermom- eter' to measure the deviation from the norm due to or caused by disease or an in silico biomarker in the termi- nology of computational biology.ConclusionsIn this article we discovered a simple new network prop- erty the PN ratio i.e.

As mentioned previously step iii is optional and only needed if network visualization is required and the step can be completed with a standard correlation net-work analysis tool such as Cytoscape  or i-Graph .A flowchart showing the four steps for computing the PN ratio.Results and DiscussionSpecies Correlation Networks SCN and their PropertiesAs stated previously we postulated that PN ratio the ratio of positive to negative links edges in the bacterial SCN is likely to be an effective indicator for differenti- ating between the healthy and diseased samples.

The margin of difference in PN ratio exceeds 120 PN of HIV negative divided by the PN of Non-ART and then minus 1.Lung In the case of cystic fibrosis CF-lung case the P N ratio for exacerbation and treated healthy microbiome is 192.00 vs. 160.67 respectively.

No sampling operation was needed for the other four datasets since the sample sizes between the healthy and disease treatments in each case are rather close to each otherfollowing flowchart i calculating the OTU correlation co- efficients with either Spearman's or Pearson's definitionsii removing false correlations with FDR false discovery rate control iii constructing the OTU species correlation networks SCN with standard network analysis software packages such as Cytoscape  or iGraph  but this step is only needed if one wishes to see the visualization of the network and is therefore optional and iv computing the PN ratio with our R-program PNRatio.r supplied in the online Supplementary materials.

We propose a simple new network property the PN ratio defined as the ratio of positive links to the number of negative links in the microbial SCN.

There are no negative links in the healthy oral microbiome.Vaginal In the BV-vaginal case study the PN ratio for the healthy vs. BV is 332.33 and 13.68 respectively and the ratio is approximately 24 times higher in the healthy microbiome network.

We tested our hypothesis with five datasets representing five major human microbiome sites and discovered that the PN ratio exhibits contrasting differences between healthy and diseased microbiomes and may be harnessed as an in silico biomarker for detecting disease- associated changes in the human microbiome and may play an important role in personalized diagnosis of the human microbiome-associated diseases.Keywords PN ratio .
