The following questions were addressed i Are the abundantrare taxa part of the core microbiome in oil-contaminated soils ii Do abundantrare taxa indicate specific conditions and is it possible to use them as an indi- cator of oil pollution iii What are the major factors that influence the assembly of the rare and abundant subcommunities and are the controlling factors similar for both subcommunities iv What are the co-occurrence patterns of the rare and abundant taxa v Do the rare taxa occupy more important positions than the abundant taxa in the network MATERIALS AND METHODS  Sampling locations and data collectionThe microbial high-throughput sequencing data sets and soil physic- ochemical parameters used in this study were recently published Jiao et al.

Based on this finding rare taxa seldom co-occurred with abundant taxa while intermediate taxa frequently co-occurred with abundant taxa.

The val- ues of these topological features were significantly higher p  .05 for abundant taxa than for rare taxa and they were also higher for core taxa than for other taxa.

According to our results rare taxa rarely co-occurred with abundant taxa in soil samples becausei conditions favouring rare and abundant taxa were different in oil- contaminated soils and therefore distinct environmental factors influenced the rare and abundant subcommunities and ii rare taxa occurred in fewer samples Fig.

In the Arctic Ocean abundant taxa show a log-normal species-abundance distribution while rare taxa exhibit a log-series distribution Galand et al.

2011.In some studies the abundance of rare taxa was influenced by the same environmental factors that drove abundant taxa such as the season and the water depth for bacterioplankton in the olig- otrophic ocean Vergin Done Carlson  Giovannoni 2013 or nutri- ent stress for bacterial populations in coastal sands Gobet et al.

Additionally 79.7 of inter- mediate OTUs belonged to the core microbiome.To explore the distributions of rare and abundant taxa across soil samples we calculated the per cent changes for rare or abundant taxa in one sample to determine whether these taxa were abundant intermediate rare or not detected in other samples Fig.

The slopes of the DDRs for abundant taxa were steeper than those for rare taxa indicating b-diversity variation is greater among abundant taxa with the increased geographic distance.The influences of edaphic and geographic factors on the struc- tures of the rare and abundant subcommunities were explored by performing CCA ordination Figure 2ab.

Interestingly no rare taxa were found in the core subnetwork while almost all abundant taxa and all edges from the abundant taxa were present in the core subnetwork Fig.
