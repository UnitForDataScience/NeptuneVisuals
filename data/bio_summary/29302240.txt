on follow-up biopsy within 30 mo of the initial biopsy 107 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer 35 of whom had gleason score 7. using a test cutoff derived from an expected 18 chance of find- ing cancer on repeat biopsy they found that their test had a negative predictive value of 91 and 96 for the detection of any cancer and gleason 7 cancer respectively.these studies represent exciting inroads to developing and refining the next generation of prostate can- cer biomarkers.

the single- parameter structure-based isopsa assay demonstrates improved diagnostic accuracy for detection of any pros- tate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer compared to a concentration-based assay of total prostate-specific antigen a preliminary report published online april 7 2017. eur urol.

at the 2017 aua conference there were multiple studies of prostate cancer diagnostic biomarkers including many novel markers.urine-based teststhere are several urine-based bio- markers currently in use includ- ing prostate cancer antigen 3 pca3 messenger rna mrna5 tmprss2-erg gene fusion and the panel selectmdx mdxhealth irvine ca which measures mrna of the genes hoxc7 dlx1 and klk3.6 additionally thereareseveral multimarker panels that have been introduced in recent years includ- ing exodx prostate intelliscore exosome diagnostics cambridge ma includes exosomal rna for erg pca3 and spdef and the michigan prostate score mips includes pca3 and tmprss2-erg mrna and serum psa.6at the 2017 aua meeting lebastchi and colleagues7 reported their clinical experience with the mips.

they found that mips scores were higher among those who underwent biopsy ver- sus those who did not and among those who had cancer on biopsy compared with those who had a negative biopsy result.in a case-control study prophet and colleagues8 assessed urinary concentrations of three differ- ent proteins previously identified to have different expression pat- terns across prostate cancer stages timp1 serpinb1 and semenoge- lin2.

they assessed those concen- trations across four groups n540 for each men without prostate cancer and men with gleason 6 gleason 8 or metastatic prostate cancer.

they found that timp1 levels were significantly higher in the control and gleason 6 samples compared with the gleason 8 and metastatic groups serpinb1 levels were significantly higher inmen with gleason 6 disease versus gleason 8 disease and semenoge- lin2 levels were significantly higher in those with metastatic disease versus control subjects.serum-based testskallikrein-based tests contemporaryserumbiomark- ers are largely dominated by the kallikreins including percent free psa fpsa3 the prostate health index phi a compound marker consisting of total psa free psa and -2propsa9 and the 4kscore opko health miami fl includes total psa free psa intact psa and hexokinase 2.610tosoian and associates1112 exam- ined the use of phi density phi adjusted by prostate volume to predict significant  national comprehensive cancer network low risk cancer on biopsy in 118 men undergoing biopsy for elevated psa.

when those two proteins and fpsa were combined they reached an auc of 0.85.taking an immunologic-based approach to cancer diagno- sis freedland and coworkers19 measured levels of 21 different autoantibodies against prostate cancer-derived peptides in order to predict the presence of cancer at ini- tial biopsy.

in 268 men they found that the autoantibody panel when combined with psa and age had an auc of 0.73 and 0.74 for the diag- nosis of any prostate cancer and gleason score 7 cancer respec- tively.

testing an array of thousands of micrornas they determined that a panel of six micrornas hsa-mir-155-5p hsa-mir-619-5p hsa-mir-6777-5p hsa-mir-6085 hsa-mir-6511b-5p and hsa-mir- 6886-5p was able to predict pros- tate cancer with an auc of 0.91.miyoshi and associates21 mea- sured serum dehydroepiandros- terone dhea levels in 203 men with psa 10 ngml undergoing initial biopsy 85 patients had pros- tate cancer on biopsy.

a panel of kal- likrein markers can reduce unnecessary biopsy for prostate cancer data from the european randomized study of prostate cancer screening in goteborg sweden.
