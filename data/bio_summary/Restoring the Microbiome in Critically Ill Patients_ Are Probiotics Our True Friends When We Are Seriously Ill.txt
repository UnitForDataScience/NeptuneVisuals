These limitations weakened the strength of the conclu- sions of the benefit of probiotic therapy in critical illness in our recent meta-analysis.15Moving forward a research agenda focused on dysbiosis therapy to restore a healthy microbiome using specific probi- otic or synbiotic therapy in critical care should be focused on the followingFirst experimental studies in animal models must con- firm depleted strains before preclinical safety and ef- ficacy studies can be conducted.Second continued research is needed for better under- standing and characterization of critical care dysbiosis via modern microbiome profiling techniques.Third in the near future ICU physicians should be able to incorporate advances in microbiome sequencing technology into clinical practice for targeting of dysbio- sis therapy.Manzanares et al533Finally future targeted probiotic therapy focused on personalizing care in critically ill patients will likely be the optimal method to improve patients' outcomes.For example the recent ICU Microbiome Project4 demon- strated a significant and rapid loss of key health-promoting bacteria ie Firmicutes and an overgrowth of well-recognized pathogens such as Enterobacter and Staphylococcus.

Thus the results of this meta-analysis do not provide sufficient evidence on the efficacy of probiotic therapy in the prevention of VAP in the ICU.11 Recently Zeng et al12 in a well-performed study includ- ing 235 critically ill adult patients who were expected to be in mechanical ventilation for 48 hours safely administered 2 strains of living bacteria Bacteroides subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis.

In our analysis probiotic therapy was not associated with a significant impact on other relevant outcomes in critically ill patients such as mortality hospital and ICU length of stay.18We performed subgroup analyses showing that probiotics appear to be more effective in reducing nosocomial infections in high risk of death patients as well as in those who received probiotics alone and with use of Lactobacillus plantarum532Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 414Figure 2.

In 2010 after aggregating 5 probiotic trials Siempos et al6 found that probiotic therapy may be able to significantly reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia VAP as the main infectious complication in the ICU.

Moreover 3 years later Barraud et al7 found similar results on ICU-acquired pneumonia although 1 year earlier Petrof et al10 had only shown a tendency to reduce the incidence of VAP in critically ill patients.

Therefore the ASPEN-SCCM guidelines have not clearly recommended the routine use of probiotics across the general population of critically ill patients.14 Similarly in 2015 the Canadian Clinical Guidelines Practice Committee15 suggested that probiotics should be considered in critically ill patients.

This has led to the largest and most robust meta- analysis of the benefit of probiotic therapy published recently in JAMA.20 In this analysis when investigators combined 63 stud- ies of 11800 patients the results showed that probiotics reduced AAD risk by 42 RR 0.58 95 CI 0.50-0.68.20 Cdifficile-associated diarrhea CDAD is a rapidly growing sub- set of AAD that significantly affects ICU patients and leads to many ICU admissions.20 A key meta-analysis of 23 studies and4200 patients recently examined the role of probiotics in the prevention of CDAD.21 This Cochrane analysis demonstrated that probiotics reduced CDAD incidence 64 and ameliorated the side effects associated with CDAD abdominal cramping nausea fever soft stool flatulence etc.

To conclude so far there is a robust body of evidence suggesting that probiotics are effec- tive in the prevention of AAD in hospitalized patients although these data should not necessarily be transferred to ICU patients.Perspectives and Future DirectionsLimitations of ICU trials of probiotic therapy to date include a significant variety of strains evaluated a wide range of daily doses various lengths of administration clinical heterogeneity and potential publication bias for the overall infection out- come.
