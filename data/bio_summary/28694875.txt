interestingly food-derived plant mirna could also function in recipient cells in a sequence-independent man- ner evidence showed plant mirna could dampen inflam- mation by binding to toll-like receptor 3 tlr3 of dendritic cells the studies of animal mirna uptake also meet various challenges.

moreover the detection of absorbed dietary mirna is also preformed and successfully detected by many groups independently.therefore the gaps in experimental functional studies of exogenous dietary mirna are to understand the mechanism of absorption and to appreciate the robust biological activity caused by such low level of secreted mirna including endogenous secreted mirna and absorbed dietary mirna.

these studies may shed light in future research of dietary mirnas as new markers or components of nutrition.for plant mirnas serving as a biomarker of dietary intake although it has been shown that plasma from an individual who reported following a vegetarian diet had a relatively high proportion of plant sequences it is quite difficult to determine the exact plant foods consumed due to the conservation of mirna sequences among different plant species.

in 2012 we reported a previously uncharacterized phenomenon ingested plant mirnas can pass through gastrointestinal tract enter the peripheral blood stream accumulate in tissues and exert gene regulation in mammals our follow-up study further showed a kinetic absorption curve of dietary plant mirnas when volunteers are fed watermelon juice and mixed fruits six out of 16 selected mirnas showed a dynamic physiological pattern in their plasma with an absorption rate of 0.04 to 1.31 the levels of dietary plant mirnas peaked within 3-6 h after intake in serum and tissues independent studies have provided the evidence both forand against the dietary mirna uptake by mammals.

because the possible se- lective absorption of dietary mirna randomly picking one or two plant mirna to measure the dietary mirna uptake in animal is highly risky.

attempted to validate our original research but found little dietary uptake of mir168a or downregulation of ldlrap1 by mir168a after rice feeding  for the contradictory detection of plant mirna uptake from the diet we have emphasized several critical issues to be carefully considered such as theselection of proper mirnas accurate normalization suit- able rna isolation method and minimized sequencing bias for more details see our replies 2. on the other hand some evidence suggest dietary mirna is a real physiological phenomenon.

while plant mirnas in animals can be accur- ately measured because of the sequence difference between plant and animal mirnas and the specific 2'-o- methylation in the 3' ends of plant mirnas animal mir- nas derived from food are more difficult to measure because of the high sequence conservation that obscures differences between dietary and endogenous mirnas.baier et al.

because of this and other apparent problems that i and others have identified in public commentary see and i would recommend that interpretation of this study be withheld until the authors and editors have responded to the post-publication critiques1.why the persistent interest on putative health effects of exogenous mirnachen-yu zhang answersthere are three possible explanations 1 people nor- mally is in fear of new thing they have been unaware or have not understood especially if the new finding is extraordinary or contradictory to the conventional concept for example european people were afraid of tomato 300 years ago when tomato was firstly imported from america 2 the positive effect of diet- ary mirna has not been appreciated and advertised for example plant mir2911 in honeysuckle soup can directly shut down influenza viruses including h1n1 n5n1 and h7n1 in vivo 3 people will appreciate the finding of dietary mirna absorption and cross- kingdom regulation when they realize that we can make a new type of medical food to treat various diseases.ken witwer respondsi agree completely with dr. zhang's point number 1. interest in the putative health effects of xenomirs may indeed be rooted in part in fear of the unknown or new discoveries.

a plant mirna might reveal that a plant was ingested or even if it was a dicot or a monocot.

as a third example pups from two mirna knockout models mir-375 and mir-200c141 showed no evidence of mirna uptake from milk of wild-type ani- mals despite high levels of mirnas in milk .

two studies reported little or low measurable uptake of plant mirnas by pcr in human and primates after a plant food- feeding study dickenson et al.

the plant mirna levels decreased to background levels after the honeysuckle diet was replaced with a normal chow diet proving that the detected mirnas are absorbed from food.

- suggested that mir2911 exhibited unusual stability was not associated with exosomes or the argonaute complex during circulation and had the stability which may be conferred by modifica- tions from the host.meanwhile some experimental results have provided dir-ect evidence for the active function of dietary plant mirna in animal consumers in multiple areas including metabol- ism viral infection immune responses and cancer.

reported that plant mir159 was predominantly detected in western human sera with the abundance of this mirna in the serum being inversely correlated with breast cancer incidence and progression in patients they further showed that oral administration of a mir159 mimicked signifi- cantly suppressed the growth of xenograft breast tumors in mice by targeting tcf7 mlotshwa et al.

thus mirna abundance is not the sole determinant of dietary mirna uptake and certain mirnas enriched in food may remain undetectable.
