DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit Qiagen Valencia CA.The paired-end sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer with the Illumina MiSeq reagent kit 600 version 3 according to the Illumina 16S meta- genomic library preparation protocol  and the 16S rRNA primer set targeting the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene .

Oyster samples were collected during low tide at Hood Canal 47.66585 -122.90285 and Oakland Bay 47.228614 -123.063575 growing areas in the Puget Sound estuarine system from July to October 2014.

A total of 13 Hood Canal samples and 11 Oakland Bay samples were collected over this period of time.

The numbers of raw paired-end reads ranged from 79174 to 2497062 in these oyster samples.
