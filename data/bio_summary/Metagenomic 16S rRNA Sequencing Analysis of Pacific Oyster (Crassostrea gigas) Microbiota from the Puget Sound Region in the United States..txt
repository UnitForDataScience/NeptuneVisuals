taxonomy was assigned to each sequence using the classifier program in ribosomal database project rdp 11.1 .

taxonomic abundance analysis was also performed using the metagenomics rast mg-rast server  and the best-hit classification was used via the rdp database with the maximum e value cutoff at 1e-10 minimum identity cutoff at 60 and minimum alignment length cutoff at 15. tenericutes 9.79 to 56.58 chlamydiae 0.71 to 47.18 proteobacteria 2.21 to 23.29 and firmicutes 1.10 to 72.70 were identified as the most abundant phyla in the oyster microbiota from both hood canal and oakland bay sites.
