other research has confirmed that individuals with healthier dietary pat- terns have higher microbial gene richness.therefore individuals with higher microbial gene richness may harbor gut microbiota with a larger repertoire of bacte- rial genes that are metabolically capable of coping with extreme changes in macronutrient intake leading to a greater potential to influence host outcomes.a number of studies have been unable to demon- strate dietary intake differences between individuals that have and individuals that have not experienced changes in host outcomes after a given dietary interven- tion.in these studies participants were not ac- tively recruited based on distinctions in dietary intakes and dietary assessment methods that assessed only cur- rent rather than habitual dietary intakes were used.

cluster 1 was as- sociated with the least healthy dietary pattern cluster 3 had the healthiest dietary pattern and cluster 2 had a dietary pattern between clusters 1 and 3. individuals with the healthiest dietary pattern cluster had lowerlevels of the inflammatory marker scd14 higher levels of anti-inflammatory adipose tissue macrophage cd163 and the highest microbial gene richness com- pared with clusters 1 and 2.in the same participant cohort cotillard and colleaguesdemonstrated that a calorie-restriction diet led to more pronounced improvements in inflammatory markers in participants with the healthiest dietary pattern.

these results suggest that habit- ual dietary fiber intakes influence butyrate production and bifidogenic response.some studies have shown that individuals with gut microbiota that are more resil- ient to dietary change have a higher diversity of vegeta- ble intake and higher vegetable fruit and fish intakes.other studies have found no differences in habitual dietary intake or dietary fiber intakes between individuals with responsive gut microbiota and individuals with permissive gut microbiota indicat- ing that inconsistencies in study results exist.

until recently no studies had been con- ducted with the primary aim of determining whether habitual dietary intakes influence the responsiveness of the gut microbiota to dietary interventions.to help fill this knowledge gap a study was con-ducted that recruited participants with distinctive habit- ual dietary fiber intakes to determine whether low vs high habitual dietary fiber influenced the response ofthe gut microbiota to an inulin-type fructan prebiotic n 14 34 healey et al.

therefore because habitual dietary intakes have a major impact on the composition of the gut microbiota it is plausible that dietary interventions could be used to modulate the gut microbiota to reduce disease risk.human dietary intervention studiesdietary interventions that aim to elicit changes in the gut microbiota provide an exciting prospect for disease prevention and management.

the prebiotic also appeared to reduce fatmass and led to a reduction in post-oral glucose toler- ance test glycemia compared with the placebo.interindividual variability in gut microbiota and host responsiveness to dietary interventionseven though various dietary intervention studies have elicited changes in both host outcomes and the gut microbiota mounting evidence suggests that individu- als are heterogeneous when it comes to gut microbiota and host responsiveness to a given dietary intervention.

it is highly likely that gut micro- biota resilience will differ depending on the dietary in- tervention being studied and host characteristics such as age sex and habitual dietary intakes of the study cohort.influence of habitual dietary intakes.

additional research is required to further clarify the influence of habitual dietary fiber intake on gut microbiota respon- siveness to certain dietary interventions.host response to dietary interventionsdietary interventions have been shown to elicit differen- tial gut microbiota responses among individuals.

this will help determine the true efficacy of a given dietary intervention and provide better consistency of results among studies.future developments of predictive mathematical models that integrate various gut microbiota habitual dietary intake and host physiological and behavioralparameters as introduced by zeevi and colleagues have promise in ensuring dietary interventions are tai- lored to the individual to improve their success.

this may in turn have implications on the con- sistency of results among studies and the perceived success or true efficacy of a dietary intervention in eliciting beneficial changes to the gut microbiota and human health.introductionnoncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease type ii diabetes mellitus t2dm chronic respiratory dis- eases and cancer contribute to more than half of all deaths worldwide.major modifiable noncommunicable disease risk factors include smoking unhealthy dietary intakes ie high saturated fat trans fat salt and sugar intakes and low whole-grain fruit and vegetable intakes physical inactiv- ity and excessive alcohol consumption.it has been postu- lated that the commensal microbes that reside within the gastrointestinal gi tract are implicated in human disease.

however a large propor- tion of dietary intervention studies that aim to modu- late the gut microbiota do not currently take baseline gut microbiota composition and habitual dietary intake into consideration.

this review also explores the role diet plays in modulating the gut microbiota and highlights whether heterogeneous gut microbiota and host response to a given dietary inter- vention could be influenced by differing baseline gut microbiota composition and habitual dietary intake.gut microbiota and human diseasethe human gi tract harbors a complex ecosystem of bac- teria commonly referred to as gut microbiota.
