75121059-1080Figure 1 Hypothetical response in relative abundance of a number of gut microbiota genera represented by vertical bars to differ- ences in habitual dietary fiber intake A C and the addition of a prebiotic in the presence of the differing habitual dietary fiber intakes B D. This figure depicts that the abundance of certain bacterial genera will markedly differ between individuals with low vs high habitual dietary fiber intakes the cross-hatched bars indicate a significant p  0.05 difference in bacterial relative abundance between low and high habitual dietary fiber consumers A C. The figure also illustrates that certain bacterial genera may respond in a distinctive manner to a prebiotic as a result of differing baseline gut microbiota profiles and habitual dietary fiber intakes B D. Hypothetically individuals with low habitual dietary fiber intakes B may have a higher proportion of gut microbiota genera which significantly change in relative abun- dance in response to a prebiotic the striped bars indicate a significant p  0.05 increase in relative abundance from baseline and the dotted bars indicate a significant p  0.05 decrease from baseline when compared with individuals with high habitual dietary fiber intakes D.

Other research has confirmed that individuals with healthier dietary pat- terns have higher microbial gene richness.Therefore individuals with higher microbial gene richness may harbor gut microbiota with a larger repertoire of bacte- rial genes that are metabolically capable of coping with extreme changes in macronutrient intake leading to a greater potential to influence host outcomes.A number of studies have been unable to demon- strate dietary intake differences between individuals that have and individuals that have not experienced changes in host outcomes after a given dietary interven- tion.In these studies participants were not ac- tively recruited based on distinctions in dietary intakes and dietary assessment methods that assessed only cur- rent rather than habitual dietary intakes were used.

These results suggest that habit- ual dietary fiber intakes influence butyrate production and bifidogenic response.Some studies have shown that individuals with gut microbiota that are more resil- ient to dietary change have a higher diversity of vegeta- ble intake and higher vegetable fruit and fish intakes.Other studies have found no differences in habitual dietary intake or dietary fiber intakes between individuals with responsive gut microbiota and individuals with permissive gut microbiota indicat- ing that inconsistencies in study results exist.

Until recently no studies had been con- ducted with the primary aim of determining whether habitual dietary intakes influence the responsiveness of the gut microbiota to dietary interventions.To help fill this knowledge gap a study was con-ducted that recruited participants with distinctive habit- ual dietary fiber intakes to determine whether low vs high habitual dietary fiber influenced the response ofthe gut microbiota to an inulin-type fructan prebiotic n 14 34 Healey et al.

Therefore because habitual dietary intakes have a major impact on the composition of the gut microbiota it is plausible that dietary interventions could be used to modulate the gut microbiota to reduce disease risk.Human dietary intervention studiesDietary interventions that aim to elicit changes in the gut microbiota provide an exciting prospect for disease prevention and management.

It is highly likely that gut micro- biota resilience will differ depending on the dietary in- tervention being studied and host characteristics such as age sex and habitual dietary intakes of the study cohort.Influence of habitual dietary intakes.

Additional research is required to further clarify the influence of habitual dietary fiber intake on gut microbiota respon- siveness to certain dietary interventions.Host response to dietary interventionsDietary interventions have been shown to elicit differen- tial gut microbiota responses among individuals.

Cluster 1 was as- sociated with the least healthy dietary pattern cluster 3 had the healthiest dietary pattern and cluster 2 had a dietary pattern between clusters 1 and 3.

This will help determine the true efficacy of a given dietary intervention and provide better consistency of results among studies.Future developments of predictive mathematical models that integrate various gut microbiota habitual dietary intake and host physiological and behavioralparameters as introduced by Zeevi and colleagues have promise in ensuring dietary interventions are tai- lored to the individual to improve their success.
