Inoculation on a Leeming medium modified with antibiotics and a Sabouraud medium AES-Chemunex with chloramphenicol 8 to 10 days at 30 to35 degC was performed to isolate Malassezia yeasts M. furfur M. globosa M. restricta M. obtusa M. pachydermatis M. sloofiae and M. sympodialis.

Overall perception of their scalp was rated on a scale from 0  very good to 3  poor.Safety assessments included the reporting of adverse events throughout the study.Analysis of the scalp microbiotaAnalysis of the scalp microbiota included in addition to Malassezia strains sampled on the scalp of the subjects a quantitative assessment of the total anaerobic and aerobic bacteria represented by Gram positive cocci.

M. obtusa M. sympodialis M. sloffiae and M. furfur were present in very small amounts and no differences were found along the treatment when the two groups were compared.

2015.A healthy stratum corneum SC not only forms a barrier to prevent water loss and to maintain hydration of the scalp it also protects against the skin from external injuries.ISSN 1876-2883 print ISSN 1876-2891 online DOI 10.3920BM2016.0144671Severe or chronic scalp barrier damage can impair proper hydration and leads to atypical epidermal proliferation keratinocyte differentiation and SC maturation which may underlie some dandruff symptoms Turner et al.

More recently research work demonstrated that dandruff is associated with imbalance in the proportion of the major bacterial and fungal populations colonising the scalp Clavaud et al.

Further evidence of a weakened scalp skin barrier in subjects with dandruff includes subclinical inflammation and higher susceptibility to topical irritants Dieamant Gde et al.

2011.Undeniably it seems as if ST11 confers a certain number of benefits at the skin level in contributing in the reinforcement of the skin barrier function and in the modulation of the skin immune system leading to the preservation of the skin homeostasis especially in dry and sensitive skin and the rebalancing of the microbiota of the scalp Benyacoub et al.

restricta and M. globosa yeasts leads to disequilibrium between the proportion of the major bacterial and fungal populations Clavaud et al.
