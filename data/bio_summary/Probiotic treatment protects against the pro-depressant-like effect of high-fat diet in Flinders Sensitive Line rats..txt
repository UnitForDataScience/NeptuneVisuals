probiotic treatment lowered the blood cd48 ratio in fsl rats f142  7.03 p  0.01 but no effect of hfd was apparent f142  0.00 p  1.0. interestingly hfd lowered the pro- portion of tregs f142  5.07 p  0.03 in the blood but did not affect the th17 percentage f142  0.00 p  1.0. contrary to these observations in fsl rats hfd increased the blood cd48 ratio in sd rats t21  2.52 p  0.02 but did not affect the percentage of tregs t14  0.14 p  0.9 or th17 cells t14  1.15 p  0.27.braincerebral cd48 ratios are presented in b and foxp3 and th17 levels are presented in b. in the brains the cd48 ratio was lower in frl rats than in fsl rats t21  3.66 p  0.002. no dif- ference was found in the proportion of tregs as opposed to the blood findings t21  0.72 p  0.48 but fsl rats had a higher pro- portion of th17 cells than frl rats t21  3.45 p  0.002. in fsl rats a significant diet x treatment interaction was present for the cerebral cd48 ratio f142  8.03 p  0.007. hence fsl-hfd had a higher ratio than all other fsl groups p  0.001. no changes in tregs or th17 cells were observed among fsl animals.

c no association between blood and brain cd48 ratio could be detected f152  0.28 p  0.6. the regression coefficient slope did not differ significantly between groups f348  0.92 p  0.4. p pro groups significantly lower than veh groups in fsl rats 2-way anova f142  7.03 p  0.01.  p  0.05  p  0.01  p  0.001. abbreviations are listed in the legend to .brain but not blood cd48 ratio closely mirrored depressive-like behaviourbloodblood cd48 ratios are presented in a and foxp3 and th17 levels are presented in a. fsl rats had a higher blood cd48 ratio than frl control rats t21  5.70 p  0.001 and a lower pro- portion of tregs t21  7.72 p  0.001 and th17 cells t21  2.24 p  0.04 as well.

in sd rats hfd only increased the plasma leptin level t14  2.18 p  0.05 but tended to lower ghre- lin levels t14  1.87 p  0.08.wbc differential count was distinctly affected by hfd in fsl and sd ratsthe fsl rat strain had a lower number of total wbc in the blood than frl rats including neutrophils t21  3.47 p  0.01 mono- cytes t21  4.34 p  0.001 and lymphocytes t21  2.09 p  0.05. hfd was associated with a decrease in eosinophils f142  19.1 p  0.001 and monocytes f142  8.53 p  0.01 in fsl rats but an increase in neutrophils in sd rats t14  2.41 p  0.03. probiotics did not affect the wbc differential count.

no difference in blood glucose levels was seen between frl and fsl strains t21  1.81 p  0.09 nor was any difference seen among fsl rats hfd effect f142  1.64 p  0.2pro effect f142  0.22 p  0.6.also hfd feeding of sd rats did not alter blood glucose levels t14  1.16 p  0.3.as regards the metabolic hormones fsl rats had higher plasma levels of ghrelin t21  3.12 p  0.005 leptin t21  2.30 p  0.03 and pyy z  3.18 p  0.002 than frl rats.

as expected hfd did not affect depressive-like behaviour in the sd rat study t14  0.14 p  0.9 b nor did it affect either swimming t14  0.44 p  0.7 or struggling t14  0.19 p  0.9.hfd but not probiotics affected locomotor activityin the open field test frl rats were less active than fsl rats t21  5.64 p  0.001. in fsl rats hfd increased activity f242  8.29 p  0.01 but no interaction with probiotics was seen f142  0.01 p  0.9. all groups spent the same amount of time in the arena centre.

the majority of cytokines were found at higher levels in fsl rats than in frl rats  p  0.05  p  0.01 p  0.001.no effects of hfd or probiotic treatment were seen.

in sd rats however hfd did not affect the brain cd48 ratio t14  1.03 p  0.3 neither were levels of tregs t14  0.02 p  0.99 or th17 t14  0.57 p  0.6 cells altered as a consequence of hfd.in the comparison of blood and cerebral cd48 ratios a linear regression model showed no association between these measuresfig.

on the contrary hfd decreased activity in sd rats t14  2.19 p  0  0.05 but did not change time spent in the arena centre t14  1.20 p  0.2. data are presented in supplementary table s7.hfd increased leptin and pyy plasma levels in fsl ratsmetabolic measures are presented in .

in fsl rats hfd increased leptin f142  7.00 p  0.01 and pyy z  2.30 p  0.02 plasma levels whereas probiotic treatment did not affect any of the measured hormones.

similar to the changes in the cd48 ratio a significant diet x treatment interaction was seen for the number of recovered cd4 cells in fsl rats f142  4.11 p  0.05 whereas no differ- ences were seen for recovered cd8 cells supplementary fig.

we have previ- ously shown that a high-fat diet hfd exacerbated depressive-like behaviour uniquely in flinders sensitive line fsl rats that inherently present with an increased level of depressive-like behaviour com- pared with flinders resistant line frl rats.we therefore investigated whether multispecies probiotics possessed anti-depressant-like effect in fsl rats or protected against the pro-depressant-like effect of hfd.
