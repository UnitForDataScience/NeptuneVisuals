No difference in blood glucose levels was seen between FRL and FSL strains t21  1.81 p  0.09 nor was any difference seen among FSL rats HFD effect F142  1.64 p  0.2PRO effect F142  0.22 p  0.6.Also HFD feeding of SD rats did not alter blood glucose levels t14  1.16 p  0.3.As regards the metabolic hormones FSL rats had higher plasma levels of ghrelin t21  3.12 p  0.005 leptin t21  2.30 p  0.03 and PYY z  3.18 p  0.002 than FRL rats.

The regression coefficient slope did not differ significantly between groups F348  0.92 p  0.4. p PRO groups significantly lower than VEH groups in FSL rats 2-way ANOVA F142  7.03 p  0.01.  p  0.05  p  0.01  p  0.001.

In SD rats HFD only increased the plasma leptin level t14  2.18 p  0.05 but tended to lower ghre- lin levels t14  1.87 p  0.08.WBC differential count was distinctly affected by HFD in FSL and SD ratsThe FSL rat strain had a lower number of total WBC in the blood than FRL rats including neutrophils t21  3.47 p  0.01 mono- cytes t21  4.34 p  0.001 and lymphocytes t21  2.09 p  0.05.

Statistically significant difference between FRL and FSL CON  VEH p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 respectively.D Statistically significant increase by HFD in FSL rats independent of probiotics p  0.05.

As expected HFD did not affect depressive-like behaviour in the SD rat study t14  0.14 p  0.9 b nor did it affect either swimming t14  0.44 p  0.7 or struggling t14  0.19 p  0.9.HFD but not probiotics affected locomotor activityIn the open field test FRL rats were less active than FSL rats t21  5.64 p  0.001.

All data are presented in .Probiotics protected against the pro-depressant-like effect of HFD in FSL ratsFRL animals showed less depressive-like behaviour than FSL rats t21  7.37 p  0.001 and more struggling behaviour t21  4.24 p  0.001 but the rat strains spent the same amount of time swimming t21  1.16 p  0.3.

HFD was associated with a decrease in eosinophils F142  19.1 p  0.001 and monocytes F142  8.53 p  0.01 in FSL rats but an increase in neutrophils in SD rats t14  2.41 p  0.03.

FSL rats had a higher blood CD48 ratio than FRL control rats t21  5.70 p  0.001 and a lower pro- portion of Tregs t21  7.72 p  0.001 and Th17 cells t21  2.24 p  0.04 as well.
