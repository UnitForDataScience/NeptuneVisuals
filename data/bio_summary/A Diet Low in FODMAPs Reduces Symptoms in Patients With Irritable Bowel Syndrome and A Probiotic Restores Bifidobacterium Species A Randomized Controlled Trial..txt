pa- tients were randomized in a 11 ratio to both diet sham vs low fodmap diet and supplement placebo vs probiotic resulting in allocation to 1 of 4 treatment groups sham dietplacebo sham dietprobiotic low fodmap diet placebo low fodmap diet probiotic.

allocation to diet and supplement was masked throughout data collection laboratory analysis data input and data analysis.proceduresthe low fodmap diet involves restricting dietary intake of fructans galacto-oligosaccharides lactose fructose in excess of glucose and polyols and is described elsewhere.blinding dietary advice trials is notoriously challenging and therefore the sham diet was designed bespoke for this trial to fulfil the following criteria 1 to be an exclusion diet that restricts a similar number of staple and non-staple foods and requires similar difficulty of dietary change to the low fodmap diet 2 to require similar intensity and duration of dietary counselling as the low fodmap diet and 3 not to impact on intakes of nutrients fiber and fodmaps.

therefore 104 patients were randomized to the sham n 53 or low fodmap diet n 51 and placebo n 51 or probiotic n 53 as follows shamplacebo n 27 shamprobiotic n 26 low fodmap dietplacebo n 24 and low fodmap dietprobiotic n 27 .

furthermore this rct evaluated whether the low fodmap diet-induced decline in bifidobacteriacan be modified by probiotic supplementation.despite the low fodmap diet resulting in significantly lower composite and individual symptom scores according to a range of validated instruments the proportion report- ing the co-primary endpoint of 'adequate symptom relief' during the low fodmap diet compared with sham diet was only of borderline statistical significance.

patients were randomly assigned blinded to groups given counselling to follow a sham diet or diet low in fodmaps for 4 weeks along with a placebo or multistrain probiotic formulation resulting in 4 groups 27 receiving sham diet placebo 26 receiving sham dietprobiotic 24 receiving low fodmap diet placebo and 27 receiving low fodmap diet probiotic.

nine patients were withdrawn from the trial 6 commenced antibiotics 2 sham 4 low fodmap diet 1 violated the protocol by following an alternative diet sham 1 was lost to follow-up sham 1 withdrew for personal reasons sham 5 were non- compliant with placebo 2 sham 3 low fodmap diet and 3 were non-compliant with probiotic 2 sham 1 low fod- map diet.

low fodmap dietary advice was shown to restrict fodmap intake while not altering energy and macronutrient intake compared with sham diet advice indicating that the observed effects are likely the result of fodmap restriction rather than changes in nutrient intake.

a placebo-controlled dietary advice trial of the low fodmap diet has yet to be performed in part because of the difficulty of designing a blinded pla- cebo diet that modifies dietary intake without altering in- takes of nutrients or fermentable carbohydrates.the low fodmap diet has been shown to induce alter- ations in some genera of the gi microbiota including bifi- dobacteriaand faecalibacterium prausnitzii.reductions in bifidobacteria are particularly relevant to ibs symptom- atology given their inverse association with abdominal pain.

however the effect has never been compared with placebo.it also remains to be demonstrated whether any potential clinical benefit of the low fodmap diet in ibs is offset by impacts on specific microbiota eg bifidobacteria or on community structure known to be a key factor influencing gut health and systemic physiology.therefore approaches that prevent the microbiota- modifying effect of the low fodmap diet are required.

firstly we aimed to investigate the effect of the low fodmap diet compared with a placebo sham diet and secondly to investigate whether the low fodmap diet-induced alterations in the microbiota could be prevented through concomitant probiotic therapy compared with placebo.methodsstudy design and participantswe performed a 2 2 factorial design multicenter ran- domized placebo-controlled trial from clinics at 2 hospitals in london uk.
