the mef microbiota mean relative abundance sd consisted of alloiococcus otitidis 37.5 40.0 haemophilus 14.4 29.1 moraxella 10.0 26.4 staphylococcus 8.2 21.9 and streptococcus 3.8 13.1. the mean relative abundance sd microbiota of the eac demonstrated a sparsity of classic otopathogens including haemophilus 0.3 0.8 moraxella 0.3 0.7 and streptococcus 0.2 0.6 but had a high abundance of alloiococcus 58.0 44.1 staphylococcus 20.8 34.0 and pseudomonas 3.2 17.1. in contrast based on previously collected data the microbiota of the adenoid pad showed a high abundance of the classic otopathogens with a sparsity of eac genera for alloiococcus 0.1 vs 28.9 respectively p  .001 haemophilus 25.2 vs 18.2 respectively p  .002 staphylococcus 0.2 vs 10.8 respectively p  .02 streptococcus 12.7 vs 4.2 respectively p  .001 and pseudomonas 0 vs 2.1 respectively p  .001. the microbiota of the mef collected during 2 consecutive years were similar alloiococcus 22.7 vs 37.5 haemophilus 22.5 vs 14.0 staphylococcus 10.9 vs 10.7 moraxella 5.0 vs 9.7 corynebacteria 6.2 vs 3.1 streptococcus 4.8 vs 3.7 and pseudomonas 1.1 vs 3.0 p  .05.conclusions and relevance the eac and the nasopharynx could serve as reservoirs for microbiota of the middle ear.

however bacteria more reminiscent of external auditory canal eac commensals are often demonstrated within middle ear aspirates.objective to compare the microbiota of the eac the middle ear with ome and the adenoid pad to further clarify the true source of middle ear bacteria.design setting and participants middle ear fluid mef aspirates and eac lavages were collected from 18 children with ome undergoing ventilation tube insertion from june 1 2014 to august 31 2015 at women and children's hospital adelaide australia.

previously collected microbiota data from the adenoid pad were collated for analysis.main outcome measures mean relative abundance of top bacterial genera for the mef eac and adenoid pad samples.results eighteen pediatric patients with chronic ome 6 female 12 male mean sd age 4836 months were recruited prospectively with 34 paired mef and eac samples.

these bacteria are commensals within the oropharynx and nasopharynx and these patho- gens are commonly believed to ascend from the aerodiges-tive tract into the middle ear via the eustachian tube.1in recent times with the increasing interest in and access to culture-independent techniques ie polymerase chain re- action pcr fluorescence in situ hybridization and most re- cently 16s ribosomal rna 16srrna gene sequencing al- loiococcus otitidis has emerged as a bacterial species that has been reported in high abundance in specimens from the middle ear.2-4 however a otitidis although commonly believed to be a commensal of the external auditory canal eac is often not found in the nasopharynx.chan et al5 recently characterized the microbiome of the middle ear and found that a otitidis was the most abundant bacteria found within middle ear effusions of children cumulative relative abundance 23. furthermore eac commensals such as pseudomonas staphylococcus and corynebacterium species were also demonstrated in high abundance from middle ear fluid mef samples.

alternatively as discussed above more patients had undergone previous myringotomy in the present cohort leading to a greater opportunity for the eac bacteria including alloiococcus to translocate into the middle ear.

despite this variation in relative abundance we believe that bacterial genera identi- fied from the middle ears of our cohort reflect a core micro- biome of the middle ear which remains relatively stable over time and between different populations a characteris- tic that has been reported at other body sites.1314our findings support those of apreviousculture-independent phylogenetic study by frank et al.8 despite differences in sam- pling techniques geographical location and seasonal and climatic factors frank et al8 also demonstrated a major abun- dance of alloiococcus 57 moderate abundance of coryne- bacterium 24 and staphylococcus 10 but only minimal abundance of pseudomonas 1.we found that the microbiome of the middle ear in ome appears to reflect the microbiomes of the adenoid pad and the eac figure 1 and table.

conversely alloiococcus staphylocccus and pseudomonas genera were found in high relative abundance in the eac but were absent in the adenoids.

however as mentioned above we ob- served a statistically significant increase in the mean relative abundance of alloiococcus in our present patient cohort com- pared with the previous cohort.5 this finding may reflect the greater number of patients with previous ventilation tube in- sertion 1 of 17 6 in the first study vs 3 of 18 17 in the pres- ent study thus allowing for a greater chance for eac bacte- ria to translocate in the middle ear.

alloiococccus otitidis is an aerobic gram-positive cocci first documented in mef by faden and dryja22 in 1989. it is typically considered a com- mensal of the eac and is not commonly identified with stan- dard techniques.423-25 however the potential for pathogenic- ity has been documented a otitidis has been found to invade intracellularly22 and to modulate immune responses in vitro2627 and has been implicated in cases of endocarditis28 and endopthalmitis.29 in addition a otitidis is the most preva- lent bacterial species found in patients with nonpurulent ome 20-40253031 and has been reported to persist within middle ear aspirates despite antibiotic treatment.4 however the effect and role of alloiococcus in the pathogenesis or de- velopment of ome remains elusive.

we believe that further in- vestigation to elucidate the role of alloiococcus in ome is war- ranted.however given the similarity between the microbiome of the eac and middle ear the possibility of contamination must be considered.
