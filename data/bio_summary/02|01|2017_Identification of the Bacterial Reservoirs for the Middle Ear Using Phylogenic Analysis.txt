The microbiota of the MEF collected during 2 consecutive years were similar Alloiococcus 22.7 vs 37.5 Haemophilus 22.5 vs 14.0 Staphylococcus 10.9 vs 10.7 Moraxella 5.0 vs 9.7 Corynebacteria 6.2 vs 3.1 Streptococcus 4.8 vs 3.7 and Pseudomonas 1.1 vs 3.0 P  .05.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The EAC and the nasopharynx could serve as reservoirs for microbiota of the middle ear.

The microbiome of the middle ears was similar when comparing the 2014 and 2015 cohorts Alloiococcus 22.7 vs 37.5 Haemophilus 22.5 vs 14.0Staphylococcus 10.9 vs 10.7 Moraxella 5.0 vs 9.7 Co- rynebacteria 6.2 vs 3.1 Streptococcus 4.8 vs 3.7 and Pseudomonas 1.1 vs 3.0 1-way ANOVA P  .001 Figure 4 however on further analysis we found a greater relative abun- dance of Alloiococcus in the second year Sidak multiple comparisons test P  .046.With the combined data set for MEF analysis again re- vealed inverse correlation between Alloiococcus and Staphy-lococcus r  0.356 P  .003.

In contrast based on previously collected data the microbiota of the adenoid pad showed a high abundance of the classic otopathogens with a sparsity of EAC genera for Alloiococcus 0.1 vs 28.9 respectively P  .001 Haemophilus 25.2 vs 18.2 respectively P  .002 Staphylococcus 0.2 vs 10.8 respectively P  .02 Streptococcus 12.7 vs 4.2 respectively P  .001 and Pseudomonas 0 vs 2.1 respectively P  .001.

When we compared the microbiome of the adenoid pad with that of the EAC Mann- Whitney test we found significant differences in relative abundance for Alloiococcus 0.1 vs 28.9 respectively P  .001 Haemophilus 25.2 vs 18.2 respectively P  .002Staphylococcus 0.2 vs 10.8 respectively P  .02 Strep- tococcus 12.7 vs 4.2 respectively P  .001 and Pseudo- monas 0 vs 2.1 respectively P  .001.DiscussionThis study is a follow-up to the previously published study by Chan et al5 which was to our knowledge the first to de- scribe the microbiome of the middle ear in children with OME in a nonindigenous Australian population using 16SrRNA gene sequencing.

The 2 data sets had comparable distribution of age mean SD 40 21 vs 48 36 months P  .39 and sex male14 61 vs 12 67 P  .84.

The mean relative abundance SD microbiota of the EAC demonstrated a sparsity of classic otopathogens including Haemophilus 0.3 0.8 Moraxella 0.3 0.7 and Streptococcus 0.2 0.6 but had a high abundance of Alloiococcus 58.0 44.1 Staphylococcus 20.8 34.0 and Pseudomonas 3.2 17.1.

Despite this variation in relative abundance we believe that bacterial genera identi- fied from the middle ears of our cohort reflect a core micro- biome of the middle ear which remains relatively stable over time and between different populations a characteris- tic that has been reported at other body sites.1314Our findings support those of apreviousculture-independent phylogenetic study by Frank et al.8 Despite differences in sam- pling techniques geographical location and seasonal and climatic factors Frank et al8 also demonstrated a major abun- dance of Alloiococcus 57 moderate abundance of Coryne- bacterium 24 and Staphylococcus 10 but only minimal abundance of Pseudomonas 1.We found that the microbiome of the middle ear in OME appears to reflect the microbiomes of the adenoid pad and the EAC Figure 1 and Table.

Analysis of b diversity also showed a difference between MEF and EAC microbiota based on the b diversity mean of distances within samples vs mean of distances between samples 0.654 vs 0.667 Mann- Whitney test P  .004 PERMANOVA P  .001.

However as mentioned above we ob- served a statistically significant increase in the mean relative abundance of Alloiococcus in our present patient cohort com- pared with the previous cohort.5 This finding may reflect the greater number of patients with previous ventilation tube in- sertion 1 of 17 6 in the first study vs 3 of 18 17 in the pres- ent study thus allowing for a greater chance for EAC bacte- ria to translocate in the middle ear.

The MEF microbiota mean relative abundance SD consisted of Alloiococcus otitidis 37.5 40.0 Haemophilus 14.4 29.1 Moraxella 10.0 26.4 Staphylococcus 8.2 21.9 and Streptococcus 3.8 13.1.
