we also obtained the aggregate demographic data of all bgp participants which enabled us to compare the characteristics of the entire set of bgp participants with those who participated in our survey.resultsthe two most common motivations for participation in the bgp were prosocial to participate in clinically useful research 78 n116 and to help clinicians in the search of cures for medical conditions 79 n118.

overall engaging participants more directly in funding designing and evaluat- ing projects as well as in collecting samples and data could help ensure the continuation and expansion of data collection in the life sciences.supplementary materialsupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at acknowledgmentswe thank tim spector and victoria vazquez at the bgp for their help with the survey.

the inter- individual diversity of microbiota composition is vast and the microbiome is a dynamic research object that changes in response to environmental physiological and pathological events.1-3 microbiomic studies require large cohorts repeated sampling from the same individuals rich phenotypic data and dynamic behavioral or clinical annotation.45the american gut project and its british offshoot the british gut project bgp have used a citizen-science approach to establishing a database on human microbiomics.6 citizen sci- ence is a broad label under which a wide range of practices are subsumed ranging from volunteers contributing money or col- lecting data to volunteers running an entire project without the involvement of professional scientists.

it is also important to remember that participants in the survey repre- sent a subset of only the participants in the bgp who chose to be recontacted.

apparently participants themselves are--at least in our study--far less concerned about the risks of such projects than some out- side commentators.18 overall because direct benefits clinical relevance did not play any decisive role in motivating par- ticipation the type of project we studied appears to have a very positive risk-to-benefit ratio in the eyes of participants.

only 7 respondents described specific risks including data leakage failure of anonymization and bioterrorism that they did not deem significant enough to deter them from participating in the bgp.we found that age and education level seemed to be impor- tant factors in recruitment with poorer recruitment among the young and less educated 710 n  99 respondents to our survey hold at least a college--or comparable--degree whereas the overall figure for the united kingdom is closer to 310. given that bioresources reliant on self-recruitment of partici- pants are already biased toward the resource-rich19 this bias may be exacerbated especially in light of the accompanying crowdfunding campaigns and the financial costs that partici- pants shoulder in these studies.four drivers of the well-known decline in research participa- tion have been identified in the literature an increase in the numbers of studies conducted public mistrust of science the burden of the studies for participants and a general decrease in volunteerism.20 citizen-science approaches can help address the last three factors.

factors that support or impede partici- pant recruitment in studies of this type have not yet been studied.methods we report the results of a survey aimed at establishing the motivations of participants in the british gut project a research proj- ect that relies on volunteers to provide samples and to help fund the project.results the two most frequently reported motivations for partici- pation were altruism and solidarity.

more than half of our 151 respondents said they would participate in further citizen-science projects 38 said they would not participate in a similar project if it was for-profit or in a project that did not release data sets in repositories accessible to scientists 30.conclusions the desire to take part in research was reported as a key motivation for participation in the british gut project bgp.

such prosocial motivations can be mobilized for the establishment of large data sets for research.genet med advance online publication 26 january 2017the establishment of databases for research in human micro- biomics poses important recruitment challenges.

although there are other more robust practices and understandings of citizen involvement in science7 the bgp is similar to citizen-science projects in the natural sciences whereby lay people contribute to the collection and annotation of data e.g.

environmental data and species observations.the gut projects use fundrazr a dedicated crowdfund- ing platform.

the project emphasizes that test takers should not take their per- sonal results as clinical advice.data are de-identified and released through the european bioinformatics institute a member of the international nucleotide sequence database consortium.8 test takers can access their own raw data using a unique identifier code.the bgp combines features of direct-to-consumer dtc genomic testing i.e.

between december 2015 and january 2016 151 participants completed an online questionnaire that was circulated via e-mail and hosted by the survey service surveymonkey.
