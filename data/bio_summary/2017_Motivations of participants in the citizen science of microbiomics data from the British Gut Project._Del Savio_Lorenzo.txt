We also obtained the aggregate demographic data of all BGP participants which enabled us to compare the characteristics of the entire set of BGP participants with those who participated in our survey.RESULTSThe two most common motivations for participation in the BGP were prosocial to participate in clinically useful research 78 n116 and to help clinicians in the search of cures for medical conditions 79 n118.

Overall engaging participants more directly in funding designing and evaluat- ing projects as well as in collecting samples and data could help ensure the continuation and expansion of data collection in the life sciences.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Tim Spector and Victoria Vazquez at the BGP for their help with the survey.

It is also important to remember that participants in the survey repre- sent a subset of only the participants in the BGP who chose to be recontacted.

Apparently participants themselves are--at least in our study--far less concerned about the risks of such projects than some out- side commentators.18 Overall because direct benefits clinical relevance did not play any decisive role in motivating par- ticipation the type of project we studied appears to have a very positive risk-to-benefit ratio in the eyes of participants.

The inter- individual diversity of microbiota composition is vast and the microbiome is a dynamic research object that changes in response to environmental physiological and pathological events.1-3 Microbiomic studies require large cohorts repeated sampling from the same individuals rich phenotypic data and dynamic behavioral or clinical annotation.45The American Gut Project and its British offshoot the British Gut Project BGP have used a citizen-science approach to establishing a database on human microbiomics.6 Citizen sci- ence is a broad label under which a wide range of practices are subsumed ranging from volunteers contributing money or col- lecting data to volunteers running an entire project without the involvement of professional scientists.

Factors that support or impede partici- pant recruitment in studies of this type have not yet been studied.Methods We report the results of a survey aimed at establishing the motivations of participants in the British Gut Project a research proj- ect that relies on volunteers to provide samples and to help fund the project.Results The two most frequently reported motivations for partici- pation were altruism and solidarity.

Between December 2015 and January 2016 151 participants completed an online questionnaire that was circulated via e-mail and hosted by the survey service SurveyMonkey.

Almost 6 in 10 57 n81 said they believed that their knowl- edge of microbiomics was sufficient to interpret results correctly.DISCUSSIONThe findings from our research need to be extrapolated with caution to the broader set of participants in the BGP.
