Among the dietary supplements tested in aquafeeds so far organic acids are increasingly gaining interest because of their strong antimicrobial and prophylactic properties against various pathogenic bacteria e. Organic acids are generally composed of short-chain fatty acids C1-C7 volatile fatty acids and weak carboxylic acids with one or more carboxyl groups in their structure.

Also the groups received 0.3e0.9 g kg-1 AP exhibited significantly higher expression of catalase gene than control c. However expression of crustin gene was not significantly affected by dietary treatments d.Organic acids have been widely used as dietary supplements for promoting growth performance in pigs and poultry feed e. Beneficial effects of organic acids supplementation on growth performance have also been reported in several aquatic animals including red hybrid tilapia Oreochromis sp.

reported enhanced growth of white shrimp following dietary administration of 2 organic acids blend consisted of for- mic lactic malic and citric acids.

To date numerous studies have been conducted on individual application of organic acids and essential oils as dietary additives for aquatic animals however to the best of our knowledge there is no available report on the use of organic acids and essential oils mixture in shrimp feed.

Activities  and increased survival rate of shrimp has been shown by organic acids application e. Results of the current study showed that adding 0.3 g kg-1 organic acids and essential oils blend to the control diet signifi- cantly enhances disease resistance of Pacific white shrimp toV.

This could be attributed to the pH reducing property of organic acids which is favorable for the growth of gut beneficial bacteria while suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria which grow at a relatively higher pH .

Currently there is an increasing tendency of using organic acids in commercial aquafeeds both for controlling dis- ease and enhancing growth performance.

The variations in the effects of organic acids on growth per- formance could be associated with their type and dose different dietary compositions and species-specific and age differences .

It has been pointed out that organic acids inhibit the growth of many pathogenic or nonpathogenic intestinal bac- teria and decrease the intestinal colonization and infectious pro- cesses which finally results in reduction of inflammatory reactions at the intestinal mucosa .
