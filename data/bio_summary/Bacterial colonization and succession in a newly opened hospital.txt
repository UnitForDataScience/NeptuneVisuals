this may be due to regularlax et al.page 3cleaning of the hospital floors or more likely the diversity of other individuals walking throughout the hospital who were not sampled in this study.to investigate the degree to which the microbiota of individual patient rooms varied over the year we calculated the variability of the core microbiome figure 3a.

to develop a community level understating of how microorganisms colonize and move through the hospital environment we mapped microbial dynamics between hospital surfaces air and water to patients and staff over the course of one year as a new hospital became operational.

staff hand microbial communities were significantly more similar to the microbiota of built hospital surfaces than were patient hands likely as a result of greater staff mobility within the hospital.

we have demonstrated that the building parameters shape the microbial sharing between occupants but that these drivers are linked to seasonal humidity trends driven by local climate.lax et al.page 4methodssample collectionsamples were collected by trained technicians at the center for care and discovery at the medical center of the university of chicago in compliance with irb12-1508.
