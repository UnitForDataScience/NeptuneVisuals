this goal is achieved with da precursors such as l-dopa drugs reducing catabolism of endogenous da thereby increasing the availability of da in the synaptic cleft and da receptor agonists.

its pathologic hallmark consists in the degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic da-ergic neurons projecting to the striatum and resulting deficit in striatal da neurotransmission.

current therapy aims at restoring da neurotransmission.

at the level of cns it has been consistently associated with intellectual disability 4. some reports also suggested a potential involvement in parkinsonism 5.authors showed that cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 cnf1 a bacterial protein toxin produced by some strains of e. coli that permanently activates rho rac and cdc42 in eukaryotic cells exerts neurotrophic effects incultured da neurons.

might be effective in the advanced stages of the disease when the loss of da cells is severe and pd is poorly controlled by the available therapies 6.authors concluded that cnf1 is endowed with neurotrophic effects on substantia nigra da-ergic neurons and shows preclinical efficacy in a model of pd.
