By contrast in spring peepers and toads there were no differences in mean Bd inhibition between dominant spring peepers 56 inhibition n 5 7 toads 47 inhibition n 5 6 and rare OTUs spring peepers 51 inhibition n 5 4 toads 47 inhibition n 5 19 P  0.8 for both Fig.

This pattern was also observed in newts dominant OTUs 71 inhibition n 5 7 rare OTUs 39 inhibition n 5 12 t 5 22.18 P 5 0.04.

In bullfrogs dominant OTUs had higher mean Bd inhibition 65 inhibition n 5 7 than rare OTUs 30 inhibition n 5 15 Fig.
