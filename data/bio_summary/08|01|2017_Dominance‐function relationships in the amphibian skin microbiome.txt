2015 we were able to identify some genera in the pre- sent study with typically high mean bd inhibition  91 inhibition serratia hafnia edwardsiella and aeromonas some with typically low bd inhibition  17 inhibition acidovorax limnohabitans and rhodococcus and some that facilitated bd growth e.g.

con- sidering these alternatives pointed to different potential conclusions about the importance of dominant and rare bacteria in these host-symbiont systems.experimental proceduresamphibian samplingsixty-four individuals of four amphibian species were sampled for both cultured and culture-independent skin bacteria near blacksburg virginia united states in summer of either 2010 bullfrogs and newts or 2012 spring peepers and toads bull- frogs rana catesbeiana n 5 19 newts notophthalmus viridescens n 5 18 spring peepers pseudacris crucifern 5 12 and toads anaxyrus americanus n 5 15. this set of bacterial isolates and sequences was used in a previous study examining the culturability of amphibian skin bacteria walke et al.

for example mean bd inhibition by iso- lates in the genera serratia hafnia edwardsiella and aeromonas were 94 93 93 and 91 respectively and when isolates were categorized as inhibitory or not all 23 isolates in these genera were  75 inhibitory table 1. similarly there were only six isolates in the genus stenotrophomonas and their mean bd inhibition was 73 with all but one isolate inhibiting bd by at least 77. erwinia was another genus that contained a large number of highly inhibitory isolates 10 of 11 total isolates with  86 inhibition.

addi- tionally otus were categorized as inhibitory 2 60 mean bd inhibition or noninhibitory  60 mean bd inhibition which is consistent with cutoffs used in previous studies on bd inhibition by amphibian skin bacterial isolates bell et al.

otus are colour-coded based on their mean bd inhibition from high inhibition 5green to no inhibition or even facilitation 5red.dataset s1.

however in spring peepers core otus had lower mean bd inhibition 45 inhibition n 5 40 than peripheral otus fig.
