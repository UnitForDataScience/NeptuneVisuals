By contrast in spring peepers and toads there were no differences in mean Bd inhibition between dominant spring peepers 56 inhibition n 5 7 toads 47 inhibition n 5 6 and rare OTUs spring peepers 51 inhibition n 5 4 toads 47 inhibition n 5 19 P  0.8 for both Fig.

2015 we were able to identify some genera in the pre- sent study with typically high mean Bd inhibition  91 inhibition Serratia Hafnia Edwardsiella and Aeromonas some with typically low Bd inhibition  17 inhibition Acidovorax Limnohabitans and Rhodococcus and some that facilitated Bd growth e.g.

In bullfrogs dominant OTUs had higher mean Bd inhibition 65 inhibition n 5 7 than rare OTUs 30 inhibition n 5 15 Fig.

Addi- tionally OTUs were categorized as inhibitory 2 60 mean Bd inhibition or noninhibitory  60 mean Bd inhibition which is consistent with cutoffs used in previous studies on Bd inhibition by amphibian skin bacterial isolates Bell et al.

OTUs are colour-coded based on their mean Bd inhibition from high inhibition 5green to no inhibition or even facilitation 5red.DATASET S1.

However in spring peepers core OTUs had lower mean Bd inhibition 45 inhibition n 5 40 than peripheral OTUs Fig.
