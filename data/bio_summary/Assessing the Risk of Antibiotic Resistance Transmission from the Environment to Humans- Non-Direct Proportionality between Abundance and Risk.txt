The worldwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs agree on the identification of a few genera or species that fall within the description of widely disseminated antibiotic resistance vectors - for example MRSA vancomycin-resistant enterococci VRE extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ESBL carbapenemaseproducing Enterobacteriaceae as well as multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile .Most Vectors Are Not PathogensThe discussion about the risk assessment of transmission of vectors from the environment to humans cannot simply rely on the model used for pathogens.

A major conclusion is that the risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans must be managed under the precautionary principle because it may be too late to act if we wait until we have concrete risk values.Risk Associated with the Environmental Antibiotic ResistomeThe risks associated with the environmental antibiotic resistome have been discussed under three different perspectives at the microbial community level the genome level and the transmission of resistance.

Hence it may increase the risks of transmission of ARB to humans.Vector Bacteria A Vehicle for ARG from the Environment to HumansThe risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans must be assessed based on bacteria rather than on their resistance genes - in particular bacteria thatKey FigureRelationship between the Natural and the Contaminant Environment Antibiotic ResistomeNaturalReservoir MDRPathogenVectorCarrierContaminantFigure 1.

This paper aims to discuss critical aspects that govern the transmission of ARB and ARG from the environment to humans and proposes the identification of some key risk determinant factors.A Transmission Chain of Reservoirs Carriers and VectorsAlthough the pathways and modes of transmission of antibiotic resistance to humans are still poorly understood there are multiple instances of evidence of the wide and rapid spread of both ARB clones and ARG variants.

Therefore the risks of transmission of ARB from the environment to humans are probably higher in the contaminant than in the natural resistome.The contaminant antibiotic resistome comprises two major types of player i carriers that are ARB with a role in the spread of ARG in the environment but which cannot colonize or infect the human body and ii vectors that are ARB that can colonize and sometimes invade the human body .

However only some bacteria constituting the contaminant resistome may have the capacity to colonize humans and these herein named vectors are those that are pivotal for assessing the risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans.

In the face of these arguments it is possible to conclude that at least for some vectors the dose that can endanger human health immediately or in the long term can be extremely low.ARB and ARG Quantification A Major Limitation for Accurate Risk AssessmentsImagining that the infective dose for all clinically relevant vectors was known the next question would be how based on such a value one could infer the risks associated with a given source of ARB.

While risks cannot be quantified accurately it is necessary to observe the precautionary principle and not disregard the potential risks associated with some environmental sources and practices.Acknowledgments This opinion paper is framed by the objectives of the research projects supported by National Funds from FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia through projects UIDMulti500162013-CBQF and WaterJPI00012013 STARE - Stopping Antibiotic Resistance Evolution European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 675530 ANSWER - ANtibioticS and mobile resistance elements in WastEwater Reuse applications risks and innovative solutions and COST-European Cooperation in Science and Technology to the COST Action ES1403 New and emerging challenges and opportunities in wastewater reuse NEREUS.Disclaimer The content of this article is the authors' responsibility and neither the financing entities nor any person acting on their behalf is responsible for the use which might be made of the information contained in it.13TDDIFSupplemental DIFI1DT4nformation Supplemental information associated with this article can be found in the online version at 15TDDIF16TDDIF .References

In resident colonization vectors pink are able to multiply in the host and their number may gradually increase due to the continuous entry andor proliferation in the host - resistance is transmitted mainly by vertical transmission cell division and horizontal gene transfer to host commensal microbiota yellow may also occur.the information available there are multiple lineages that include bacteria that can be found in environmental sources and in the human microbiome suggesting that vectors may belong to a wide diversity of bacterial groups .

In transient colonization vectors red have a short contact time with the host although it may be enough to transfer antibiotic-resistance genes ARG to the host microbiota yellow - resistance is transmitted mainly by horizontal gene transfer and may increase over time due to proliferation or successive gene transfer.
