this paper aims to discuss critical aspects that govern the transmission of arb and arg from the environment to humans and proposes the identification of some key risk determinant factors.a transmission chain of reservoirs carriers and vectorsalthough the pathways and modes of transmission of antibiotic resistance to humans are still poorly understood there are multiple instances of evidence of the wide and rapid spread of both arb clones and arg variants.

therefore the risks of transmission of arb from the environment to humans are probably higher in the contaminant than in the natural resistome.the contaminant antibiotic resistome comprises two major types of player i carriers that are arb with a role in the spread of arg in the environment but which cannot colonize or infect the human body and ii vectors that are arb that can colonize and sometimes invade the human body .

the second mode of transmission of arb to humans is through an acute colonization from external sources with the immediate invasion oftable 1. critical factors that determine the level of risk associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic-resistance genes arg in the environmentabased on the who framework used for food safety purposes the host.

the subsections below discuss some of the parameters that would need to be determined to establish coherent risk assessment frameworks.characterization of the environmental compartmentthe detection and quantification of contaminant arb and arg in a specific environmental compartment is a proxy of its potential as a relevant source of antibiotic resistance transmission.

a bacterial strain with a low infective dose harboring a gene conferring resistance to a last-resource antibiotic and with a high potential to multiply in the human body will be among the arb classified at the top level of risk.

a major conclusion is that the risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans must be managed under the precautionary principle because it may be too late to act if we wait until we have concrete risk values.risk associated with the environmental antibiotic resistomethe risks associated with the environmental antibiotic resistome have been discussed under three different perspectives at the microbial community level the genome level and the transmission of resistance.

hence it may increase the risks of transmission of arb to humans.vector bacteria a vehicle for arg from the environment to humansthe risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans must be assessed based on bacteria rather than on their resistance genes - in particular bacteria thatkey figurerelationship between the natural and the contaminant environment antibiotic resistomenaturalreservoir mdrpathogenvectorcarriercontaminantfigure 1. human activities lead to the continuous discharge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes to the environment which accumulate and spread over different environmental compartments.

the worldwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs agree on the identification of a few genera or species that fall within the description of widely disseminated antibiotic resistance vectors - for example mrsa vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl carbapenemaseproducing enterobacteriaceae as well as multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile .most vectors are not pathogensthe discussion about the risk assessment of transmission of vectors from the environment to humans cannot simply rely on the model used for pathogens.

a third perspective of risk refers to the transmission of arb or antibiotic-resistance genes arg from the environment to humans .

this mode of transmission is frequent in health care units and may involve a wide diversity of nosocomial agents  some of which may have reached the hospital environment through other patients that suffered infections with arb that had their origin in silent colonizations.since colonization by vector bacteria may be silent for most humans this may lead to an underestimation of the extent of transmission of arb from the environment to humans.

risk assessment applied to public health issues is often challenging and when it involves microorganisms andtheir genes the accuracy of risk estimation can be seriously impaired.

presents an overview of factors that are critical to assess the level of risk associated with a given environmental compartment as a potential source of transmission of arb to humans.

moreover it must be emphasized that often people with the highest risk of an infection due to arb have their primary and immune barriers compromised.

in the face of these arguments it is possible to conclude that at least for some vectors the dose that can endanger human health immediately or in the long term can be extremely low.arb and arg quantification a major limitation for accurate risk assessmentsimagining that the infective dose for all clinically relevant vectors was known the next question would be how based on such a value one could infer the risks associated with a given source of arb.
