Hence it may increase the risks of transmission of ARB to humans.Vector Bacteria A Vehicle for ARG from the Environment to HumansThe risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans must be assessed based on bacteria rather than on their resistance genes - in particular bacteria thatKey FigureRelationship between the Natural and the Contaminant Environment Antibiotic ResistomeNaturalReservoir MDRPathogenVectorCarrierContaminantFigure 1.

This mode of transmission is frequent in health care units and may involve a wide diversity of nosocomial agents  some of which may have reached the hospital environment through other patients that suffered infections with ARB that had their origin in silent colonizations.Since colonization by vector bacteria may be silent for most humans this may lead to an underestimation of the extent of transmission of ARB from the environment to humans.

This paper aims to discuss critical aspects that govern the transmission of ARB and ARG from the environment to humans and proposes the identification of some key risk determinant factors.A Transmission Chain of Reservoirs Carriers and VectorsAlthough the pathways and modes of transmission of antibiotic resistance to humans are still poorly understood there are multiple instances of evidence of the wide and rapid spread of both ARB clones and ARG variants.

Therefore the risks of transmission of ARB from the environment to humans are probably higher in the contaminant than in the natural resistome.The contaminant antibiotic resistome comprises two major types of player i carriers that are ARB with a role in the spread of ARG in the environment but which cannot colonize or infect the human body and ii vectors that are ARB that can colonize and sometimes invade the human body .

The current knowledge suggests that a complex combination of variables referring to different environmental compartments ubiquitous bacteria and human- bacteria interaction may rule the risks of transmission to humans .

While colonizing bacteria can be present on skin or mucosa they do not have the capacity to penetrate into tissues but infectious bacteria are able to proliferate and invade the host causing an immune reaction typical of infectious diseases.Two major modes of transmission of antibiotic resistance to humans can be hypothesized.

The high loads of contaminant antibiotic-resistant bacteria continuously discharged to the environment and the fact that the contaminant resistome comprises bacteria and genes that coevolved with animals and humans hence with higher chances of colonizing humans and animals are major reasons to give 7TDDIFthe contaminant resistome particular attention.

To colonize humans vector bacteria must have the chance to get in contact with the human body which means that these bacteria must share the same environment with humans either occasionally or on a regular basis.

As a complement the degree of exposure of humans to the specific environmental compartment needs to be used as a measure of the probability that vector bacteria will colonize humans exposure x infective dose.Characterization of Vector BacteriaVector bacteria are the other crucial component for assessing risk.

However only some bacteria constituting the contaminant resistome may have the capacity to colonize humans and these herein named vectors are those that are pivotal for assessing the risks of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans.
