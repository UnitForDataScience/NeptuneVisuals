Those that have the potential of enhancing plant hormones are termed biological enhancers and those mineralizing or- ganic contaminants detrimental to plant health are called rhizoremediators Malusa and Vassilev .Scientific articles usually refer to biofertilizers as microbial isolates Table  having the potential to promote plant growth and development Bardi and Malusa  Alori et al.

In particular great resistance was demonstrated to Pectobacterium carotovorum disease by plants producing bacterial kind of acyl homoserine lactonaseTable 1Contributions of biofertilizers to plant productivityMycorrhizal fungiContributions towards plant productivityReferencesGlomusetunicatumEnhanced vegetative growth chlorophyll and nutrient level in maizemore than non mycorrhizal maize plantAlien arbuscular mycorrhizal fungiEnhanced root and shoot biomass of Juniperus oxycedrus than nonmycorrhizal fungi even in the presence of environmental stressVignaradiataThe fungus had positive impact on the nitrogen potassium phosphorus and protein content of the green grainNecrotrophic mycorrhizal speciesIncrease the nutrient status and secure plant against herbivoresuch as aphids attackAM fungiReduce the concentration of cadmium in pant grown under cadmium-contaminated site thereby enhancing its productivityGomus intraradicesMycoremediate zinc from Medicago truncatula environment with theresultant effect of improved growth and developmentGlomus mosseaeImproved wheat yield even under more efficient in enhancing crop yield under stressSadhana  Alguacil et al.

Modification of plant defense system caused by mycorrhizal invasion leads to local and systemic plant immune response to diseases Hao et al.

Thus whether the microbial isolate enhances plants' growth by adding nutrients to the rhizosphere that is fixing atmospheric nitrogen into the form that can be used by plants or by increasing the bioavailable portion of soil nutrient to plant in as much as the plant nutrient provision has been improved upon Alori et al.

These include knowing the persistence and infection potential of inoculated AMF amidst already existing indigenous AMF community getting more insight on the adaptableness of alien AMF to a foreign environment and the significance of genetic variabil- ity among AM fungal species and its impact on plant growth and finally determining whether there is a direct or indirect impact on crop productivity by inoculated AMF.Concluding remarksIt is important to improve on the activities of microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that contribute posi- tively on plant nutrition via absorption of scarce nutrients plant resistance to diseases and that help plants to tolerate different abiotic stressors to sustain and increase worldwide food production in yet to come climate situations while pre- serving environmental health.

The overexpression of potassi- um transporter protein in plant has been stated in the roots of Lotus japonicas colonized with AM fungi Berruti et al.

Rhizosphere microorganisms can have direct or indirect impacts on plant biodiversity in an ecosystem.Many organisms are involved in these processes resulting in myriads of interactions among plants symbionts and antagonists within below and above ground environment Babalola  Behie et al.

These technologies also monitor inoc- ulated AMF in the plant throughout the cultivation phase Pellegrino et al.

Rodriguez and Sanders .Novel aspects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungiBefore now much attention has been on the nutrient absorp- tion potentials of mycorrhizal fungi for plant growth and de- velopment most especially the assimilation of phosphorus Vosatka et al.

One example of ecological or ecosystem services provided by mycorrhizal fungi is the control of soil erosion by enhancing soil structure and return of plant pho- tosynthetic products into MF biomass is also an important Bcarbon sink globally Vosatka et al.
