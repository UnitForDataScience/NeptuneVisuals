In the present study we demonstrated for the first time that administration of LcS-fermented milk could reduce gut bacterial translocation to the blood in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Previous studies clearly showed that persons with higher levels of gut bacterial DNA in the blood were at risk of developing diabetes in the future and in animal models a high-fat diet caused gut bacterial DNA to be phago- cytosed by macrophages and to subsequently accumulate in the adipose tissue.

However the number of probiotic cells was half of that used in our study 4 x 1010 cells and the study period of 12 weeks was shorter than that in our study 16 weeks.

Second as our study did not use a double-blind design patients were aware they were taking probiotics and may have been familiar with their effects on the gut microbiota which might have biased the results of the study.

Thus interesting roles of the gut microbiota in glucose metabolism are closely linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes and manipulation of the human gut microbiota might provide important clues regarding a new therapeutic target for diabetes.The leaky gut has also been attracting a great deal of attention in the context of metabolic diseases.

The remaining 68 patients were analysed.the results of these previous studies bacterial translocation due to leaky gut could play a still unidentified role in the pathophysiology of diabetes through insulin resistance andor other unknown mechanisms.Previously we reported for the first time the presence of gut dysbiosis and a higher rate of detection of live gut bacteria in the blood of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetes suggesting that bacterial translocation occurs in type 2 diabetes.

One patient in the control group declined to participate in the study and one patient in the probiotic group was excluded from the analysis due to the onset of acute enteritis during the study period.

Furthermore the present study confirmed the presence of bacteremia in type 2 diabetes as did our previous study.

Therefore our method in this study can evaluate bacterial translocation.One previous study showed that individuals with metabolic syndrome had higher concentration of fecalZonulin and calprotectin and increased BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio in fecal samples and that probiotic LcS did not affect this.

The selected patients were excluded from the study if any of the following conditions was diagnosed at registration 1 serious kidney disease serum cre- atinine level  2.0 mgdL and  or haemodialysis 2 serious liver disease excluding fatty liver 3 inflammatory bowel disease 4 20  body mass index 35 5 past history of digestive surgery and 6 not suitable for the study patients with irregular visits to the hospital and poor adherence to therapy.

Here we performed an interventional randomised control study to investigate whether probiotics could reduce bacterial translocation and cause changes in the gut microbiota.
