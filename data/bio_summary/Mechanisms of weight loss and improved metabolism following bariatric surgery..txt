moreover we highlight the importance of the gastrointestinal tract including alterations in bile acid physiology secretion of intestinally derived hormones and the microbiome as a potent mediator of improved metabolism in postbariatric patients.keywords bariatric surgery obesity roux-en-y gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy adjustable gastric bandintroductionthe global prevalence of overweight body mass index bmi 25-30 kgm2 or obesity 30 kgm2 in adults is estimated to be 2.1 billion people and has been rising in both developed and developing countries.1 this is a particularly important pub- lic health concern in the united states the centers for disease control estimated that the prevalence of obesity among adults was 37.7 in 2014.2 the health and economic impact of obesity can- not be overstated with increased mortality3 and comorbidities including coronary artery disease3-5 hypertension6 hyperlipidemia7 type 2 diabetes mellitus t2d sleep apnea8 osteoarthritis910 and many forms of cancer.11 the associated costs of medical care for obesity-related illnesses in the united states are estimated at 147-185 billion per year.1213bariatric surgery also known as metabolic surgery is increasingly recognized as one of the most effective interventions for obesity and associated conditions helping patients to achieve significantand sustainable weight loss as well as improved overall health.

moreover vsg modestly improved the anorectic action of leptin with magnitude similar to calorie- restricted controls such neuropeptide expression changes paralleled reductions in body weight.75 in mice signaling via mc4r is critical for surgical weight loss.76 however humans with a heterozy- gous mutation in the mc4r gene do lose weight after surgery suggesting that mc4r-related sig- naling may not be essential for bariatric surgery- induced weight loss in humans.76peripheral nervous systemthe peripheral nervous system has also been directly implicated in altering food intake.

in turn these regions of the brain integrate hormonal nutrient and neural input and orches- trate appropriate responses.87after rygb plasma levels of pyy increase mod- estly 20 in the fasting state88 and by 3.5-fold in the postprandial state.89 similarly postprandial levels of pyy increase 1 year following vsg.90 by contrast pyy levels increase minimally following lagb.89 animal studies support a prominent role for pyy in mediating bariatric weight loss as post- surgical weight loss is lower in pyy gene knockout as compared with wild-type mice91 and infusion of anti-pyy antibodies increases food intake in post- bypass rats.92 thus enhanced pyy secretion may contribute to weight loss after rygb.glp-1glp-1 is another l cell-derived hormone that is increased in both the fasting and postprandial states as early as 2 days after rygb93 such increases in glp-1 are sustained up to 10 years post-rygb.94 postprandial levels of glp-1 also increase after vsg as much as 1.7-fold and as early as 6 weeks postop- eratively however fasting levels do not change.95 by contrast glp-1 levels are not altered after lagb.8996glp-1 has received major attention as a poten- tial hormonal mediator of the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery as it increases glucose- dependent insulin secretion and glp-1 analogues are highly effective therapeutics for human t2d and obesity.

demonstrated that fxr gene knockout mice regained weight lost after vsg and did not have comparable improvements in fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance as compared with their wild- type controls.148 whole-body fxr gene knockout mice are also resistant to dietary obesity the poten- tial role for alterations in fgf-15 levels mouse ortholog of human fgf-19 remains unknown.148 similarly whether fxr signaling andor fgf-19 contributes to improvements in body weight and glycemia after bariatric surgery in humans is uncer- tain at present.interestingly rerouting bile in the intestine to the distal small bowel by transposing the common bile duct to the ileum results in impressive improve- ments in metabolism in mice.149 these includeimproved body weight glucose metabolism and hepatic steatosis reduced free fatty acids and triglyc- erides and increases in plasma bile acids similar to those seen after rygb.

other pro- cedures such as biliopancreatic diversion and duo- denal switch are not typically performed in the united states.comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery versus medical therapy for obesitymultiple clinical trials have demonstrated supe- rior efficacy and sustainability of weight loss andfigure 1. normal and postbariatric surgery anatomy of the intestinal tract.

bile acid supplementation in rodents can reduce weight gain134 and plasma lev- els of bile acids in the postprandial state are inversely related with body fat mass.135 while the effects of bile acids can be observed in multiple organs bile acids exert particularly interesting effects in the gut lumen where they can modulate enteroendocrine cell production of critical incretin hormones such as glp-1.136 bile acids also directly influence themicrobiome through antimicrobial properties of conjugated bile species137 and may signal indirectly through activation of ileal nuclear receptor fxr and its downstream products including ang1 inos il-18 and fgf-19.138forms of bariatric surgery that alter the ali- mentary route lead to increases in plasma levels of both primary and secondary bile acids.139-143 for example both rygb and biliopancreatic diver- sion increase fasting and postprandial bile acids by twofold to threefold with parallel alterations in composition.139140143 similar but more modest increases in both fasting and postprandial bile acids are observed after vsg.144 by contrast lagb is not associated with alterations in bile.143mechanisms responsible for increases in cir- culating bile acids and altered composition after bariatric surgery remain uncertain but could include increased hepatic synthesis or altered enterohepatic recirculation of bile.

understanding these mecha- nisms is a hot topic in research as this information could lead to more individualized choice of surgical procedure refined surgical techniques or develop- ment of nonsurgical interventions to induce sus- tainable weight loss.macronutrient and micronutrient absorption and gut enteroplasticitymacronutrientshistorically the induction of caloric malabsorption by surgical alteration of gastrointestinal anatomy was viewed as the likely mechanism by which surgery could promote weight loss28 and result in associated macro- and micronutrient deficien- cies.

this was associated with increases in intestinal but not hepatic fxr-fgf-15 signaling.149 together this supports the hypothe- sis that changes in delivery of bile acids to the distal small bowl and bile acid signaling contribute mecha- nistically to weight loss after some forms of bariatric surgery.conclusionsbariatric surgery is increasingly recognized as one of the most effective interventions to help patients achieve significant and sustainable weight loss as well as improved overall health.
