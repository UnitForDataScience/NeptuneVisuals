Moreover we highlight the importance of the gastrointestinal tract including alterations in bile acid physiology secretion of intestinally derived hormones and the microbiome as a potent mediator of improved metabolism in postbariatric patients.Keywords bariatric surgery obesity Roux-en-Y gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy adjustable gastric bandIntroductionThe global prevalence of overweight body mass index BMI 25-30 kgm2 or obesity 30 kgm2 in adults is estimated to be 2.1 billion people and has been rising in both developed and developing countries.1 This is a particularly important pub- lic health concern in the United States the Centers for Disease Control estimated that the prevalence of obesity among adults was 37.7 in 2014.2 The health and economic impact of obesity can- not be overstated with increased mortality3 and comorbidities including coronary artery disease3-5 hypertension6 hyperlipidemia7 type 2 diabetes mellitus T2D sleep apnea8 osteoarthritis910 and many forms of cancer.11 The associated costs of medical care for obesity-related illnesses in the United States are estimated at 147-185 billion per year.1213Bariatric surgery also known as metabolic surgery is increasingly recognized as one of the most effective interventions for obesity and associated conditions helping patients to achieve significantand sustainable weight loss as well as improved overall health.

Microbiota may influ- ence host energy and nutrient metabolism via transcriptional regulation promoting increased fat storage in adipose tissue126 and by processing indi- gestible luminal polysaccharides into short chain fatty acids which can then be absorbed by the host.120121127128Not surprisingly bariatric surgery induces pro- found changes in the microbiome likely a result of dietary environmental systemic and anatom- ical changes that accompany bariatric surgery.

Bile acid supplementation in rodents can reduce weight gain134 and plasma lev- els of bile acids in the postprandial state are inversely related with body fat mass.135 While the effects of bile acids can be observed in multiple organs bile acids exert particularly interesting effects in the gut lumen where they can modulate enteroendocrine cell production of critical incretin hormones such as GLP-1.136 Bile acids also directly influence themicrobiome through antimicrobial properties of conjugated bile species137 and may signal indirectly through activation of ileal nuclear receptor FXR and its downstream products including ANG1 iNOS IL-18 and FGF-19.138Forms of bariatric surgery that alter the ali- mentary route lead to increases in plasma levels of both primary and secondary bile acids.139-143 For example both RYGB and biliopancreatic diver- sion increase fasting and postprandial bile acids by twofold to threefold with parallel alterations in composition.139140143 Similar but more modest increases in both fasting and postprandial bile acids are observed after VSG.144 By contrast LAGB is not associated with alterations in bile.143Mechanisms responsible for increases in cir- culating bile acids and altered composition after bariatric surgery remain uncertain but could include increased hepatic synthesis or altered enterohepatic recirculation of bile.

Bariatric surgery is increasingly recognized as one of the most effective interventions to help patients achieve significant and sustained weight loss as well as improved metabolic and overall health.

Unfortunately the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which bariatric surgery achieves weight loss have not been fully elucidated yet are critical to understanding the central role of the intestinal tract in whole-body metabolism and to developing novel strategies for the treatment of obesity.

Other pro- cedures such as biliopancreatic diversion and duo- denal switch are not typically performed in the United States.Comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery versus medical therapy for obesityMultiple clinical trials have demonstrated supe- rior efficacy and sustainability of weight loss andFigure 1.
