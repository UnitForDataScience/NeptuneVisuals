surprisingly reverse fecal microbiome transplantation from r to s rats exacerbated the transplanted s rats' hypertensive responses an effect that was associated with significantly elevated plasma levels of the fatty acids acetate and hepta- noate leading to the hypothesis that the different microbial composition altered plasma scfa levels that in turn may affect bp regulation .the microbiome composition was further examined in an additional rodent model of hyper- tension the spontaneously hypertensive rats shrs which features elevated bp levels and increased response to high salt diet as compared to normotensive wistar kyoto wky control rats 22 fecal microbiota analysis revealed pro- found differences in the bacterial composition between the shr and wky rats with the former featuring reduced taxa richness and compositional alterations as compared to wky rats.

although gene variants are present in dahl-s vs. r rats they do not relate to phenotype in other salt-sensitive rat models and are not more common in the dahl than in the sprague- dawley strain the microbiota of s rats was found to be distinct from that of r rats with bacteriaof the phylum bacteroidetes and the family veillo- nellaceae found to be more abundant in the former as compared to the latter strain 21 however microbiome depletion in s rats by antibiotic admin- istration did not significantly affect their hyperten- sive responses to the high salt diet suggesting that the gut microbiome does not directly mediate the hypertensive phenotype in this model.

in a search for a causative relation between the microbial composition and hypertension in this model fecal microbiome was transferred from osa induced-hypertensive or from control rats into untreated rats followed by induc- tion of osa in recipient rats under normal diet conditions.

in addition fecal microbiome transplantation from s to r rats did not transfer the hypertensive phenotype into the r rats.

analysis of microbiome composition in rats featuring osa- induced hypertension revealed a reduced relative abundance of three main taxa in comparison with sham rats fed high-fat diet clostridiaceae dehalo- bacterium and holdemania.

in the shr model induction of low-grade inflammation was suggested to play a role in the augmented vascular contractility displayed in these rats future studies utilizing immune perturbed animal models such as tlr-deficient mice might shed light on potential involvement of the microbiome-immune axis in bp regulation.human studies assessing the microbiome roles in hypertensionthe potential role of the microbiome in regulating human bp and causing hypertension has been scarcely studied to date.

supportive evidence for microbiome-derivedscfa regulation of bp through olfr78 and gpr41 came from the finding that oral antibiotic admin- istration was associated with significantly increased sbp dbp and arterial bp in olfr78-deficient mice but not in wild-type mice more research is needed to find additional metabolites that mediate bp regulation by the microbiome.microbiome modulation for the treatment of hypertensionelevated bp is usually treated with a combination of life style modifications including weight loss reduced sodium intake increased physical activity limited alcohol consumption and nutritional interventions such as the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet coupled with a large arsenal of antihypertensive interventions often given in combinations and collectively utilized in both prevention and treatment of hypertension targeting the microbiome as a means of hypertension treatment and using microbiome features as a means of personalizing hypertension drug selection are the subject of ongoing research as described below.as early as the 1990s sour milk fermented by lactobacillus helveticus and saccharomyces cerevisiae was suggested to reduce angiotensin i-converting enzyme ace activity in rat aortas reducing bp by about 20 mmhg without affecting the rats' weight ace converts the hormone angiotensin i to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii which leads to the constriction of blood vessels and to bp elevation.

recent studies suggest that the microbiome partici- pates in bp regulation and the pathogenesis of hy- pertension 202122 mainly through secretion of a variety of microbial-derived bioactive metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids scfas in this review we portray the interplay between the gut microbiome and hypertension.

for example the gut microbiome has been recently suggested to affect susceptibility to multiple disorders such as obesity type i diabetes mellitus 73 color- ectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease these studies indicate that charac- terization of microbiome patterns can potentially serve as a noninvasive biomarker for disease pheno- type in addition to host genetics.

these results emphasize the necessity to investigate not only the host's but also the microbiome expression profile in elucidating complex phenomena dictating drug availability efficacy and side-effects.likewise several medications commonly administered to patients suffering from features of the metabolic syndrome including the antidia- betic drug metformin and the lipid-lowering drug simvastatin were suggested to be modu- lated by the gut microbiome.

hinting that gut dysbiosis is associated with hypertension in humans gut microbiome composition analysis of 10 patients with normal sbp 119 2 mmhg and seven patients with elevated sbp 144 9 mm hg revealed a decreased bacterial richness and alte- red bacterial compositions as demonstrated by weighted unifrac analysis in hypertensive individ- uals compared with normotensive controls 22 specific differences between bacterial composition of hypertensive and control patients were not specified in this study.

the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor chemotherapeu- tic agent irinotecan for example used to treat patients with colon lung and brain cancers is known to cause severe diarrhea following gut commensals modification in vivo the prodrug irinotecan is metabolized into its active compound sn-38g which is processed in the gut into sn-38 by bacterial b-glucuronidase the latter responsible for large amount of intestinal side-effects the glycoside digoxin which is commonly used to treat heart failure and arrhythmias has lately shown to be metabolized by gut microbiota to its inactive form dihydrodigoxin.

while r rats do not develop an elevated bp after being fed with high salt diet 8 nacl s rats respond to high salt diet by a significant increase in bp.

at the phylum level the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio was five- fold higher in the shr rats as compared to wky rats.
