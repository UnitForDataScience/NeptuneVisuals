Ben-Dovb and Eran ElinavaINTRODUCTIONThe microbiome is a diverse microbial ecosystem that has coevolved with the host which plays a part in the modulation of multiple physiological processes .

Recent studies suggest that the microbiome partici- pates in BP regulation and the pathogenesis of hy- pertension 202122 mainly through secretion of a variety of microbial-derived bioactive metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids SCFAs In this review we portray the interplay between the gut microbiome and hypertension.

Although gene variants are present in Dahl-S vs. R rats they do not relate to phenotype in other salt-sensitive rat models and are not more common in the Dahl than in the Sprague- Dawley strain The microbiota of S rats was found to be distinct from that of R rats with bacteriaof the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Veillo- nellaceae found to be more abundant in the former as compared to the latter strain 21 However microbiome depletion in S rats by antibiotic admin- istration did not significantly affect their hyperten- sive responses to the high salt diet suggesting that the gut microbiome does not directly mediate the hypertensive phenotype in this model.

Surprisingly reverse fecal microbiome transplantation from R to S rats exacerbated the transplanted S rats' hypertensive responses an effect that was associated with significantly elevated plasma levels of the fatty acids acetate and hepta- noate leading to the hypothesis that the different microbial composition altered plasma SCFA levels that in turn may affect BP regulation .The microbiome composition was further examined in an additional rodent model of hyper- tension the spontaneously hypertensive rats SHRs which features elevated BP levels and increased response to high salt diet as compared to normotensive Wistar Kyoto WKY control rats 22 Fecal microbiota analysis revealed pro- found differences in the bacterial composition between the SHR and WKY rats with the former featuring reduced taxa richness and compositional alterations as compared to WKY rats.

Supportive evidence for microbiome-derivedSCFA regulation of BP through Olfr78 and Gpr41 came from the finding that oral antibiotic admin- istration was associated with significantly increased SBP DBP and arterial BP in Olfr78-deficient mice but not in wild-type mice More research is needed to find additional metabolites that mediate BP regulation by the microbiome.MICROBIOME MODULATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSIONElevated BP is usually treated with a combination of life style modifications including weight loss reduced sodium intake increased physical activity limited alcohol consumption and nutritional interventions such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet coupled with a large arsenal of antihypertensive interventions often given in combinations and collectively utilized in both prevention and treatment of hypertension Targeting the microbiome as a means of hypertension treatment and using microbiome features as a means of personalizing hypertension drug selection are the subject of ongoing research as described below.As early as the 1990s sour milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was suggested to reduce angiotensin I-converting enzyme ACE activity in rat aortas reducing BP by about 20 mmHg without affecting the rats' weight ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II which leads to the constriction of blood vessels and to BP elevation.

For example the gut microbiome has been recently suggested to affect susceptibility to multiple disorders such as obesity type I diabetes mellitus 73 color- ectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease These studies indicate that charac- terization of microbiome patterns can potentially serve as a noninvasive biomarker for disease pheno- type in addition to host genetics.

These results emphasize the necessity to investigate not only the host's but also the microbiome expression profile in elucidating complex phenomena dictating drug availability efficacy and side-effects.Likewise several medications commonly administered to patients suffering from features of the metabolic syndrome including the antidia- betic drug metformin and the lipid-lowering drug simvastatin were suggested to be modu- lated by the gut microbiome.

Although individual response to antihypertensive intervention is noto- riously unpredictable there are no published stud- ies to date to the best of our knowledge assessing or predicting the effects of the microbiome on the availability or activity of antihypertensive drugs.CONCLUSIONAmong the increasing number of diseases found to be associated with microbiome changes hyperten- sion was directly and indirectly linked with dysbio- sis.

Furthermore microbiome composition and function may be manipulated by probiotics prebiotics and fecal microbiome transplantation potentially modifying its effects on BP control.

Seminal studies pointed toward possible microbiome effects on metabolic homeo- stasis including obesity glucose intolerance type 2 diabetes mellitus aging and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease .Hypertension is a common human condition historically defined by a sustained elevation of systolic blood pressure SBP above 140 mmHg or diastolic BP DBP above 90 mmHg.
