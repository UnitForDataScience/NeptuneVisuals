however we observed a moderate overlap in terms of inferred interactors enriched functions and preferentially targeted network modules additional file table s16-s18 and a modest concordance in term of net- work module perturbators additional file  table s19.the results of these analyses suggest that on the one hand actively invading fusobacteria species share common mechanisms to interact with host cell and on the other hand are consistent with the fact that f. nucleatum is an unusual heterogeneous species both at the genotypic and phenotypic level  finally the commonalities between the fusosecretome and the e. coli k-12 secreted proteins are not surprising since previous work showed that e. coli k-12 carries cryptic genes coding for virulence factors  whose expression is activated by mutations in the histone-like protein hutable 3 network module significantly enriched in inferred human interactorsfor each module the following information is reported identifier number of constituent proteins number of inferred human interactors in the module number of inferred interactions between proteins in the module and fusosecretome proteins number of interacting fusosecretome proteins representative annotations biological process and cellular component selected as the most frequent and significantly enriched annotations for the given module for the complete list of functional annotations see additional file  table s9table 4 list of the main candidate virulence proteins in the fusosecretomeuniprotkb ac protein namegene symbol domainsinteractingdomainsinteracting slimsq8rim1fusobacterium outer membrane protein familyfn1554autotransportera -ligfha1 ligfha2 ligpp1b ligsh2srcbligsh2stat5 ligsh33b ligsumosbm1b modn-glc1b trgendocytic2bq8rgk2hemolysinfn0291filhaemagg2a -ligfha1 ligfha2 ligrbpabgroove1bligsh2grb2 ligsh2srcb ligsh2stat5 ligsumosbm1b modck11 modck21b modgsk31 modn-glc1b modpikk1 trgendocytic2bq8rgt9peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase msraq8rhb9hypothetical exported24-amino acid repeat proteinmsrapmsr selrpmsr selrclvpcskpc1et21 ligfha1 ligsh2grb2ligsh2srcb ligsh2stat5modcteramidation modpikk1 trgendocytic2bfn2118morn2-ligsh2grb2 ligsh2srcbq8r609pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductasefn1421porn por ekr fer47tppenzymectppenzymecligcyclin1b ligsh2grb2 ligsh2stat5 ligsh33b ligsumosbm1b ligwwpin14 modck11 modck21b modgsk31modpikk1 modprodkin1 trgendocytic2bq8rh03chaperone protein dnajdnajdnajdnajcxxcxgxg ctdiidnaj dnajcxxcxgxgclvndrndr1 clvpcskski11 ligcyclin1b ligfha2 ligsh2stat5 ligsh33b ligsumosbm1b ligtraf21b ligwwpin14 modck21b modplk modprodkin1 trgendocytic2bq8r643pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductasefn1170porn por ekr fer47tppenzymectppenzymecligbrctbrca11 ligsh2grb2ligsh2stat5 ligsh33b ligsumosbm1b ligwwpin14 modck11 modck21bmodgsk31 modprodkin1 trgendocytic2bq8rdq9fusobacterium outermembrane protein familyfn1449--clvpcskski11 ligfha1 ligfha2ligpdzclass2 ligsh2srcb ligsh2stat5 ligsumosbm1b modgsk31modn-glc1b modplkq8r608serine proteasefn1426peptidases8a autotrnsrpta autotransporterapeptidases8clvpcskski11 ligfha2 ligpdzclass2 ligsh2stat5 ligsumosbm1b modck11 modck21b modgsk31 modpka2 trgendocytic2bq8rfv3hypothetical cytosolic proteinfn0579mg1 a2mn a2mn2 a2ma2mn a2mn2 a2mligcyclin1b ligfha2 ligsh2stat5 ligsumosbm1b modck21b modpikk1 modpka2q8r5p1dnase i homologous protein dhp2q8r5y8biotin carboxyl carrier protein of glutaconyl- coa decarboxylasefn0891exoendophosexoendophosligsh2grb2 trgendocytic2bfn0200biotinlipoylbiotinlipoylligsumosbm1b ligwwpin14modprodkin1 modsumobq8r6d6serine proteasefn1950peptidases8a autotransporterapeptidases8ligfha2 ligsh2stat5 ligsumosbm1b modck11 modck21b modgsk31 modpka2q8re26single-stranded dna- binding proteinssbssbassbligbrctbrca11 ligfha1 ligfha2ligpdzclass2 ligsumosbm1b modpka2 trgendocytic2bq8rej1dipeptide-binding proteinfn1111sbpbac5-clvpcskski11 ligbrctbrca11ligcyclin1b ligsh2grb2 ligsumosbm1b ligwwpin14 modck21b modprodkin1q8rg20hemin receptorfn0499pluga-clvpcskpc1et21 ligcyclin1b ligfha1ligmapk1 ligpdzclass2 ligsh2stat5 ligsh33b ligsumosbm1b modgsk31 modn-glc1btable 4 list of the main candidate virulence proteins in the fusosecretome continuedfor every protein the detected pfam domains are reported along with the list of domains and slims for which at least one interaction has been inferredapfam entry detected in at least one protein sequence stored in the database of known bacterial virulence factorsbmotif for which it was experimentally identified at least one instance in a viral or bacterial proteinwhich convert this established commensal strain to an invasive species in intestinal cells discussionover the years it has been shown that f. nucleatum can adhere and invade human cells triggering a pro- inflammatory response.

doing so we obtained 3744 interactions 1544 domain- and 2201 slim-mediated interactions respectively between 144 fusosecretome which we designated as candidate virulence proteins and 934 human proteins additional file table s4 and additional file table s5 designated as human inferred interactors.table 1 enrichment of pfam domains in the fusosecretome compared to non-secreted proteinsaa clan is defined as a collection of related pfam entries sharing sequence or structural similaritybpfam entry detected in at least one protein sequence stored in the database of known bacterial virulence factorscpfam entry detected in at least one human protein sequencednumber of occurrences in the fusosecretome enumber of occurrences in non-secreted proteins fpfam domain matches with a corrected p value 0.1in order to assess the reliability of the inferences we evaluated the biological relevance of the putative human interactors by performing enrichment analyses of differ- ent orthogonal datasets using as a reference background all the proteins encoded by the human genome.first human proteins experimentally identified as binders or targets of bacterial and viral proteins are over-represented among the 934 inferred human interac- tors of the fusosecretome proteins 415 proteins 1.3-fold p value  1.61 x 10-11. notably the over-representation holds when bacterial and viral binders are considered separately 176 bacterial interactors 1.1-fold p value  3.5 x 10-3 and 338 viral interactors 1.5-fold p value 2.2 x 10-16. this re- sult is consistent with current knowledge on convergent tar- geting of host proteins by distinct pathogens  7 .

indeed the human interactors of the fusosecretome are enriched in i proteins identified in the human colon secretomes of colorectal cancer crc tissue samples 3.5-fold p value 2.2 x 10-16 ii proteins encoded by genes whose expression correlates with f. nucleatum abun- dance in crc patients twofold p value  4 x 10-4 and iii genes associated with inflammatory bowel diseases ibds twofold p value  8 x 10-4. we obtained very similar enrichments by using a reduced statistical background corresponding to the interaction inference space see the  section and additional file supplementary results.altogether the results of these analyses highlight the relevance of the inferred human interactors as putative binders of fusosecretome proteins and their potential implication in gut diseases therefore validating the undertaken inference approach.functional role of the human proteins targeted by f. nucleatumglobally the inferred fusosecretome human interactors are involved in several processes related to pathogen infectionsuch as immune response and inflammation response to stress endocytosis as shown by the 137 significantly enriched biological processes gene ontology go terms among their annotations table  additional file table s6a.

moreover to date only a handful of pathogenic factors has been ex- perimentally identified and protein interaction data between these factors and human proteins which could inform on the molecular details underlying host- cell subversion mechanisms are sparse altogether this underlines that a comprehensive view of the molecular details of the f. nucleatum--human cross-talk is currently missing.how could f. nucleatum hijack human cells patho- gens employ a variety of molecular strategies to reach an advantageous niche for survival.

we defined the perturbation z score for each f. nucleatum protein f interacting with at least one protein in module m as followsthe manuscript aleksandar kostic broad institute usa for kindly providing the list of human genes whose expression correlates with f. nucleatum abundance in colorectal cancer patients and henrik nielsen dtu bioinformatics denmark for assistance in running secretomep predictions.

moreover among the multi- functional inferred human interactors we found anenrichment of extreme multifunctional proteins 52 inter- actors twofold enrichment p value  1.0 x 10-5 which are defined as proteins involved in unrelated cellular func- tions and may represent candidate moonlighting proteins 64. this suggests that the fusosecretome might perturb multiple cellular pathways simultaneously by targeting preferentially a whole range of multifunctional proteins.functional subnetworks of the human interactome perturbed by f. nucleatum and identification of the main candidate virulence proteinsbased on their enrichment in inferred human interactors 31 network modules 4 of the 855 detected modules are preferentially targeted by 138 distinct proteins of the fusosecretome table .

second according to the human proteins atlas see the  section the vast majority of the inferred human interactors has been detected either in small intestine 652 70 or colorectal 671 proteins 72 tissues as well as in the saliva 673 72 confirming their presence in human body sites hosting f. nucleatum.

by detecting the presence of host mimicry elements we have inferred the protein interactions between the pu- tative secretome of f. nucleatum and human proteins and ultimately provided a list of candidate virulence proteins and their human interactors that can be ex- perimentally exploited to test new hypotheses on thef.

analogously for the slim- mediated interaction inference for a given known elm motif m interacting with the domain c in the human protein c if the motif m occurs in the f. nucleatum pro- tein a then a is inferred to interact with c.human proteins targeted by bacteria and viruseswe gathered a list of 3428 human proteins that were ex- perimentally identified as interaction partners of three bacterial pathogen proteins bacillus anthracis francisella tularensis and yersinia pestis in a large-scale yeast two- hybrid screen .

given the redundancy among swissprot and trembl entries protein sequences were clustered using the cd- hit algorithm swissprottrembl pairs at 95 identity were considered as the same protein interactions of trembl protein were assigned to the swissprot protein.

- to our knowledge domain-motif templates have been only exploited so far to infer or to resolve human-virus protein interaction networks  indeed slim mimicry is widespread among viruses  but increasing evidence shows that it can be an effective subversion strategy in bacteria as well third we performed a network-based analysis on the human interactome to identify the main candidate f. nucleatum virulence proteins and the sub- networks they likely perturb.our approach relies on two prediction steps i the definition of the fusosecretome based either on the presence of a signal peptide or several protein features such as disorder content and ii the detection of host mimicry elements involved in the interaction with the host.

both datasets were downloaded in august 2013. the domain-based interaction inference works as follow given a pair of known interacting domains a and b if domain a is detected in the f. nucleatum protein a and domain b in the human protein b then an interaction between a and b is inferred.

nevertheless the current know- ledge on the molecular players underlying the f. nucleatum--human cross-talk is still limited.for this reason we carried out a computational study to identify f. nucleatum putative secreted factors fuso- secretome that can interact with human proteins.the originality of our study is manifold compared to previous work.

although we cannot exclude a misprediction ribosomal proteins can be secreted in some bacteria and be involved in host interaction furthermore increasing evidence shows that ribosomal proteins are moonlighting proteins with extra-ribosomal functions such as the e. coliribosomal l2 protein that moonlights by affecting the activity of replication proteins among the 337 in- ferred interactions between the 20 fusosecretome ribo- somal and 183 human proteins only a third of latter belong to ribosomal protein families.

interestingly only 3 of the 41 human interactors inferred for f. nucleatuml2 are ribosomal proteins and we identified the l2 protein as candidate virulence protein preferentially targeting module 451. as this module is mainly involved in cell cycle and dna repair this result is consistent with the ability of l2 in e. coli to interfere with dna processing factors  and further reinforces the confi- dence in the secretome prediction.
