Since the Salmonella belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae the significant decreases in relative abundance of Enterobacteria- ceae by Calrose treatment determined by microbiome analysis are in accordance with the results showing a significant reduction in Salmonella populations by Calrose treatment deter- mined by bacterial culture method.Metabolite profiles reveal small molecules and metabolic pathways with potential anti-Salmonella activityMetabolite analysis was performed with only the Calrose supplemented incubations since Cal- rose showed the most significant antimicrobial activity among the three cultivars of rice tested.

Experiments were performed in triplicate.Microbiome analysisMicrobiome analysis was conducted in triplicate on two controls feed  cecal and cecal only controls and the Calrose treatment feed  cecal  Calrose in the adapted mixed culture condition described above at various time points 0 6 12 24 and 48 h using cecal contents from two different ages of broilers 28 and 42 days.

Calrose bran rapidly decreased S. Typhimurium levels when compared with the feed  cecal control at 24 h. The population of S. Typhimurium initially 6.73 log CFUml in the Calrose bran-containing cultures were significantly reduced to 2.55 log CFUml after 24 h P  0.05.

A-C Weighted and D-F unweighted UniFrac PCoA plots of individual sample in each group.and Calrose treatment only the Calrose treatment group was slightly clustered but detectable patterns of obvious clustering were not observed R value from weighted and unweighted plot0.437 and 0.322 respectively .Comparison of bacterial communities.

In the Calrose treatment group when the incubation time increased the abun- dance of Clostridia significantly increased from 44.09 at initial time to 78.70 at 48 h incuba- tion while that of Gammaproteobacteria decreased from 39.77 at the initial time to 0.58 at 48 h incubation.At the order taxonomic level overall microbial distributions via sequencing exhibited the most operational taxonomic units OTUs belonging to Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales with 35.80 and 42.68 for the cecal only control group 75.93 and 16.71 for the feed  cecal control and 42.14 and 12.31 for the Calrose treatment group .

f and o in parentheses indicate family and order respectively.Clostridiales was significantly higher for the Calrose treatment than controls while the abun- dance of Enterobacteriales was significantly lower in the Calrose treatment 0.97.At the family taxonomic level overall microbial distributions detected by sequencing revealed that most of the identified OTUs belonged to Clostridiaceae Enterobacteriaceae Lach- nospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae with 23.25 26.84 14.07 and 9.55 group average value for the cecal only control group and 9.03 37.83 10.50 and 9.45 for feed  cecal control respectively .

Osmoprotectants are compatible solutes that accumulate within cells during periods of osmotic stress caused by high osmolarity highMetabolites that decreased 20 fold over the course of the 24 h anaerobic culture comparing the fold change 24 h0 h for feed cecal control negative control and Calrose cultures.Metabolites that increased  20 fold over the course of the 24 h Calrose anaerobic cultures and the corresponding increases for the feed  cecal control negative control cultures.

A potentially interesting metabolite of unknown structure designated 552 was considerably reduced in Calrose cultures compared to control cultures at 24 h .In conclusion the cultures containing Calrose bran had significantly less Salmonella recov- ered compared to control cultures without rice bran.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the  which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original author and source are credited.In this study rice brans from different cultivars Calrose Jasmine and Red Wells were assessed for their ability to inhibit Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium using an in vitro mixed anaerobic culture system containing cecal microbiota obtained from broilers of different ages.

Among the three rice brans only Calrose exhibited a rapid inhibition of S. Typhimurium which decreased to undetectable levels after 24 h under the adapted incubation.
