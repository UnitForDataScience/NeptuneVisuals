Sulfate reduction rates decreased significantly to 3.7 - 0.2 umol day-1 at 2 mM sulfate and 7.0 - 1.3 umol day-1 at 5 mM sulfate compared to the electron acceptor limitation at 15.3 - 1.1 umol day-1 with 2 mM sulfate and 43.3 - 0.8 umolday-1 with 5 mM sulfate.

For electron donor limitation experiments tricultures containing S. wolfeiDvH 195 were constructed in defined medium see Table S2 in the supplemental material with 7.0 mM butyric acid 0.7 mM TCE and 2 mM or 5 mM sulfate and N2CO2 8020 volvol headspace .

In order to study the competition for H2 by dechlorination and sulfate reduction under electron donor limitation we maintained a triculture of the S. wolfei DvH and 195 strains S. wolfeiDvH195 on 5 mM butyrate 0.7 mM TCE and 2 mM sulfate  with different initial cell ratios of DvH to strain 195 see Table S2 in the supplemental material.

reported that 10 mM sulfate addition to soil had no significant effect on TCE dechlorination by indigenous microorganisms whereas higher sulfate concentrations 15 and 20 mM yielded slower dechlorination.

The culture has been maintained in the laboratory for more than 15 years in a continuously stirred semibatch fed reactor and its community structure and dechlorination performance have been previ- ously described   .In order to study the competition between reductive dechlorination and sulfate reduction under electron acceptor limitation electron donor in excess strain 195 and DvH were grown in defined medium with an H2CO2 headspace  with 0.7 mM TCE and 2 or 5 mM sulfate see Table S2 in the supplemental material.

In this study 12 mM lactate was amended to the coculture initially as an electron donor whereas 5 mM sulfate and 0.55 mM TCE were added as electron acceptors .

Based on stoichiometry 11.1 mM lactate would be required to reduce both electron acceptors 10 mM lactate for sulfate reduction to sulfide and 1.1 mM lactate for TCE reduction to ethene creating electron acceptor limitation.

Based on stoichiometry see equations in Table S1 in the supple- mental material 5.4 mM butyrate would be required to fully reduce each of the electron acceptors 2 mM sulfate to hydrogen sulfide and 0.7 mM TCE to ethene.

First 5 mM butyrate 2 mM sulfate and 0.7 mM TCE were amended and the triculture was routinely subcultured into fresh medium 10 volvol every 14 days after TCE was fully reduced to ethene data not shown.

Two sulfate concentrations 2 and 5 mM were amended to ANAS with 20 mM lactate and0.2 mM TCE for electron acceptor limitation.
