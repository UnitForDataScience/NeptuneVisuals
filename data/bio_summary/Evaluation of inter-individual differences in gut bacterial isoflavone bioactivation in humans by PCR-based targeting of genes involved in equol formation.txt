Formation of equol black bars and dihydrodaidzein grey bars from daidzein within a 24 h and b 48 h. Formation of equol black bars and daidzein white bars from dihydrodaidzein within c 24 h and d 48 h. The sequence of donor appearance on the x axis is according to the amount of equol formed from daidzein by the corresponding faecal sample.

Amplicons were only sporadically observed in the nonequol producers.Conclusion The majority of human subjects who produced equol were also detected with the developed PCR-based approach.Significance and Impact of the Study The obtained results shed light on the distribution and the diversity of known equol-forming bacterial species in the study group and indicate the presence of as yet unknown equol-forming bacteria.IntroductionIntestinal bacteria play a crucial role in the metabolism of dietary isoflavones which are suggested to protect against certain cancer types cardiovascular disease osteoporosis and menopausal symptoms Ko 2014 Messina 2016.

The definition of the equol producer phenotype is currently based on urinary or serum equol concentrations.

2006.ResultsScreening of human faecal samples for equol formationFaecal samples of eight of the 17 subjects FS 3 FS 6 FS 8 FS 10 FS 11 FS 12 FS 15 FS 17 formed equol from daidzein with dihydrodaidzein as an intermediate Fig.

The challenge of this approach is to develop appropriate degenerate PCR primers which essentially target all genes encoding a specific key enzyme in different bacterial species.Although information about enzymes involved in the formation of equol by gut bacteria and their encoding genes is still limited in a first approach we detected genes related to this conversion in the complex human microbiome using PCR amplification with newly designed and validated primers.

No PCR products were detected with genomic DNA of closely related non equol-forming members of the Coriobacteriaceae such as Slackia exigua Slackia faecicanis Slackia heliotrinireducens Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243 and E. lenta rK3.Application of primers targeting DHDR and THDR genes in the microbiome of human faecal samples with varying equol-forming abilityGenomic DNA was isolated from FS of the 17 human donors which had been tested for equol formation as described above.

Analysis of clone libraries revealed the amplification of sequences exclusively related to Adlercreutzia equolifaciens in four of the subjects tested positive for equol formation whereas in three of the equol producers only sequences related to Slackia isoflavoniconvertens were observed.

While three FS FS 3 FS 6 FS 8 showed nearly complete conversion of daidzein to equol a very low equol concentration was detected only after 48 h of incu- bation in the faecal slurry from FS 11.

The amounts of equol formed within 24 and 48 h of incubation varied largely between the individual samples.
