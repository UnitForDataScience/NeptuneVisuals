Therefore the TB group showed lower counts than the other groups when considering the number of bacteria per fecal weight p  0.021 and p  0.055 compared to the RF and CC groups respectively.Regarding particular bacterial groups both the CC and TB groups presented lower counts of E. coli than the RF group with the counts being even lower in the CC group than in the TB one.

Furthermore the unexpected higher fecal pH when theobromine was ingested alone deserves further studies focusing on microbial metabo- lites which could explain the observed fecal pH changes.The current results evidence that theobromine both inthe TB and CC diets contributes to the lower proportion of bacteria coated with IgA found after the cocoa diet in line with previous results 5 7 15.

All samples were hybridized at the specific probe hybridization temperature as described 15 and kept in the dark at 4degC overnight until FCM analysis.In order to determine the total bacteria number the sam- ples were mixed with propidium iodide PI 1 mgmL Sigma- Aldrich Madrid Spain prior to FCM analysis 5.Determination of the proportion of bacteria coated with IgAQuantification of IgA-coated bacteria was carried out as pre- viously described 15.Flow cytometry analysisFor FISH and IgA-coated bacteria quantification FCM anal- ysis was performed using a FacsAria SORP sorter BD San Jose' CA USA as previously described 5.

Barcelona Spain containing 0.25 theobromine and the theobromine TB group ingested a standard diet including 0.25 of theo- bromine Sigma-Aldrich Madrid Spain i.e.

The metagenomics analysis even though it was carried out in a small number of samples allows to have an idea of particular genera andor species from gut microbiota modified by CC and TB diets and thus by using both techniques in a complementary manner we obtained a wider approach to the gut microbiota changes.According our FISH-FCM results theobromine seems to exert an inhibitory effect on gut microbiota mainly on bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum Clostridium histolyticum-C. perfringens group and Streptococcus spp.

Moreover theobromine modifies gut microbiota although other cocoa compounds could also act on intestinal bacteria attenuating or enhancing the theobromine effects.KeywordsFISH  Metagenomics  Methylxanthines  Microbiota  Short-chain fatty acidsAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived March 9 2017Revised June 1 2017Accepted June 1 2017IntroductionAlthough cocoa powder was initially used for medical pur- poses by Mesoamerican civilizations 1 it is only recently that cocoa has come to be considered a valuable product with healthy properties 2.

In addition theobromine modifies gut microbiota although other cocoa compounds -such as cocoa polyphenols or fiber- also act on the intestinal bacteria at- tenuating or enhancing the theobromine effects that overall leads to the global effect of cocoa on microbiota which differs from that of each particular cocoa component.The authors would like to thank the Flow Cytometry and Genomic Services of the 'Centres Cient'ifics i Tecnologics' of the University of Barcelona CCiT-UB and the Genetic Diagnos- tic Bioarray facilities Bioarray Alicante Spain for their tech- nical assistance.

CC and TB diets induced lower counts of E. coli whereas TB diet led to lower counts of Bifidobacterium spp.
