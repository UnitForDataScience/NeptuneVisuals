A.C.V.O.Abstract The aim of this study was to establish normal ophthalmic parameters for select diagnostic tests in American white pelicans Pelecanuserythrorhynchos.

The value mean 6 SD for PRRT and IOP was14.9 6 7.84 mm15 sec and 9.0 6 1.41 mm Hg oculus uterque respectively.

The normal pelican eye was found to have relative conjunctival hyperemia absent filoplumes iris color ranging from light blue to brown and a subcircular vertically elongated pupil.

The most common ophthalmic abnormality in this species was cataracts.Key words Eye intraocular pressure microbiota ocular pupil.INTRODUCTIONAvian species represent a considerable portion of animal collections in zoologic parks worldwide.

The pelican with the eye with phthisis bulbi was excluded from this testing method.

The DNA extraction and analysis were performed based on previous studies.1011 Bacterial 16S rDNA ampli- cons were constructed via amplification of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16s rDNA gene with universal primers U515F806R flanked by Illu- mina standard adapter sequences.634 Oligonucle- otide sequences are available at proBase.20 A single forward primer and reverse primers with a unique 12-base index were used in all reactions.PCR reactions 50 ll contained 100 ng ofgenomic DNA forward and reverse primers 0.2 lM each dNTPs 200 lM each and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase 1 U. PCR amplification was performed as follows 988C300 th 988C015 th 508C030 th 728C030 3 25 cyclesth728C700.

The Fisher exact test of independence was used to determine whether there was a relationship between eye color and sex of the birds.

The PRTT values from the OD and OS were averaged for each bird and a t-test was used to determine whether there was variation in this value based on sex of the birds.
