If common underlying risk factors can lead to gut and cen- tral nervous system pathology then it is logical to consider relationships between GI symptoms and core or associated behavioral symptoms in ASD.Based upon clinical experience we hypothesized that severe constipation would be associated with more promi- nent rigid-compulsive symptoms in ASD.

As shown in Table  participants with GI symptoms including functional constipation and non-retentive fecal incontinence did not differ significantly on demographic characteristics ADOS scores or FSIQ.Within the medication-free subgroup scores on our pri- mary outcome measure the RBS-R Compulsive Behav- ior subscale were higher for participants with functionalTable 3 Medication-free sample characteristics and relationship with GI symptomsTotal nNo QPGS GIdiagnosis n  32Functional constipation n  12Non-retentive fecal incontinencen  1Other Rome-III diagnosesn  2p valueSex460.641Table 4 Behavioral relationships with functional constipation in participants who were not taking medications likely to affect repetitive behav- ior or FCVariableSummary statisticsAdjusting for age and verbal status -others n  11constipation compared to those with no QPGS-R III diag- nosis after adjusting for both verbal status and age although this difference was not statistically significant p  0.093.

First data were only available from a single point in time preventing us from understanding whether changes in func- tional constipation symptoms predict changes in rigid- compulsive symptoms or vice versa.

In the absence of more detailed data on GI symptoms we operationalized severe constipation as co-occurring reports of constipation with soiling or9 Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program The Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Departments of Radiology Neurology and Psychological Sciences University of Missouri Columbia MO USA10 Department of Psychiatry and Sackler Institutefor Developmental Psychobiology Columbia University New York NY USA11 New York State Psychiatric Institute New York NY USA12 New York Presbyterian Hospital Center for Autismand the Developing Brain 1051 Riverside Drive Mail Unit 78 New York NY USAdiarrhea suggestive of overflow encopresis which itself was not directly ascertained within the AS-ATN data set Peters et al.

we did not observe a significant association between functional constipation and verbal status possibly because our population only included ten participants who were minimally verbal.The broad pattern of behavioral association with func- tional constipation is somewhat consistent with factor analytic and principal components analyses of repetitive behavior in ASD which report between one and five symp- tom domains with the most consistency around a cluster of symptoms variously termed higher-order complex rigid-compulsive or resistance to change Anagnos- tou et al.

was used to assess rigid-com- pulsive symptoms and other repetitive behavior symptoms.

This sug- gests that GI symptoms could help to identify a subgroup of children who may share a common pattern of ASD symptoms.

Similarly associations between GI symptoms and measures of autonomic function were much more mod- est than the behavioral symptoms observed here Fergu- son et al.

Children with constipation alone without other co-occurring GI symptoms also showed significant asso- ciation with clinician diagnosis of OCD.
