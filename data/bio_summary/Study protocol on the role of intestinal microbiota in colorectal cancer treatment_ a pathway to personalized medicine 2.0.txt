this study aims to bridge this translational gap in order to explore the impor- tance of the human intestinal microbiota in crc treatment by initiating an explorative prospective multicenter cohort study in the maastricht university medical centre and zuyderland medical centre.if the human microbiota can predict response to systemic treatment with a non-invasive method chemotoxicity can be reduced in non-responders andor systemic therapy regimes can be changed.
