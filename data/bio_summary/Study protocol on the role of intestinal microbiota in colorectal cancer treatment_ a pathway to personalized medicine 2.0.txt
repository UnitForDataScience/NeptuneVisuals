In the future new ther- apeutic pathways could be created by providing fecal micro- biota transplantation to replenish maintain or create an opti- mal microbiota composition .MethodsStudy objectivesPrimary objectiveThe primary object is to investigate whether the microbiota composition can act as a predictor for response andor chemotoxicity to three cycles of systemic treatment with cap- ecitabine with or without bevacizumab or TAS-102 in pa- tients with metastatic andor irresectable CRC.Secondary objectiveThe secondary objective of this study is to investigate the microbiota composition changes during systemic treatment with capecitabine with or without bevacizumab or TAS-Int J Colorectal Dis 2017 321077-10841079102 and its relation to response andor chemotoxicity in pa- tients with metastatic andor irresectable CRC.Study designAn explorative multicenter cohort study will be performed in the Maastricht University Medical Centre MUMC and Zuyderland Medical Centre.PopulationAll patients with metastatic andor irresectable CRC who will receive three cycles systemic treatment are eligible to partici- pate in this study.

This study aims to bridge this translational gap in order to explore the impor- tance of the human intestinal microbiota in CRC treatment by initiating an explorative prospective multicenter cohort study in the Maastricht University Medical Centre and Zuyderland Medical Centre.If the human microbiota can predict response to systemic treatment with a non-invasive method chemotoxicity can be reduced in non-responders andor systemic therapy regimes can be changed.
