In the future new ther- apeutic pathways could be created by providing fecal micro- biota transplantation to replenish maintain or create an opti- mal microbiota composition .MethodsStudy objectivesPrimary objectiveThe primary object is to investigate whether the microbiota composition can act as a predictor for response andor chemotoxicity to three cycles of systemic treatment with cap- ecitabine with or without bevacizumab or TAS-102 in pa- tients with metastatic andor irresectable CRC.Secondary objectiveThe secondary objective of this study is to investigate the microbiota composition changes during systemic treatment with capecitabine with or without bevacizumab or TAS-Int J Colorectal Dis 2017 321077-10841079102 and its relation to response andor chemotoxicity in pa- tients with metastatic andor irresectable CRC.Study designAn explorative multicenter cohort study will be performed in the Maastricht University Medical Centre MUMC and Zuyderland Medical Centre.PopulationAll patients with metastatic andor irresectable CRC who will receive three cycles systemic treatment are eligible to partici- pate in this study.

This study aims to bridge this translational gap in order to explore the impor- tance of the human intestinal microbiota in CRC treatment by initiating an explorative prospective multicenter cohort study in the Maastricht University Medical Centre and Zuyderland Medical Centre.If the human microbiota can predict response to systemic treatment with a non-invasive method chemotoxicity can be reduced in non-responders andor systemic therapy regimes can be changed.

Capecitabine and TAS-102 are both fluoropyrimidines used for systemic treat- ment in colorectal cancer patients.Methods An explorative prospective multicenter cohort study in the Maastricht University Medical Centre and Zuyderland Medical Centre will be performed in 66 patients.

A recent study showed that the human in- testinal microbiota signature is able to predict in vivo treat- ment response to antibiotics in patients with Clostridium difficile infections .

Another in vivo study used microbiota composition of the female urogenital tract to predict failure of implementation of an embryo in in vitro fertilization IVF .

The pilot study results of the Erasmus Medical Center showed that IVF fails with 96 certainty in the presence of an unfa- vorable microbiota profile .Colorectal cancer CRC is the third most common cancer in the world.

One in vitro study re- cently indicated a better response of CRC cell lines to 5-FU in the presence of Lactobacillus plantarum supernatant .

Another in vitro study indicated that 5-fluorocytosine 5-FC structurally related to 5-FU samples incubated with viable Escherichia coli showed a higher increase in active 5-FU con- centration compared to samples incubated with non-viable E. coli.

The patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the MUMC or Zuyderland Medical Centre can be selected for participation.Inclusion criteriaPatients diagnosed with metastatic andor irresectable CRC who will be treated with oral capecitabine with or without intravenous bevacizumab or oral TAS-102Aged 18 years or olderWritten informed consentExclusion criteriaMicrosatellite instability MSIHas not received any prior systemic therapy for the treat- ment of CRC during the previous 4 weeks prior to start the current line of capecitabine or TAS-102Patients treated with additional systemic treatments dur- ing planned treatment periodRadiotherapy within 2 weeksTherapeutic antibiotic use within past 3 monthsRenal function calculated creatinine clearance Cockroft- Guilt  30 mlminPregnant or nursingPhysically or mentally incapable or incompetentPatient accrualA medical oncologist will propose the study during a regular hospital visit to each eligible patient.
