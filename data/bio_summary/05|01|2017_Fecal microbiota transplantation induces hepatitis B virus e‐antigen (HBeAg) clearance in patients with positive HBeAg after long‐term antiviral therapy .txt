In the FMT arm 2 participants patients C and E achieved HBeAg clearance after one FMT whereas patient D achieved HBeAg clearance after two FMT treatments.

The results demonstrated that FMT can induce HBeAg clearance in a significant proportion of the cases who have persistent positive HBeAg even after long-term antiviral treatment.

The gut microbiota appears to play a criti- cal role in age-related immune clearance of HBV.2 Several studies have indicated that CHB patients with liver cirrhosis have different microbiota com- pared to healthy people.34 The leakage hypoth- esis has linked gut microbiota to the onset and progression of liver diseases.5 Thus we reported on a case-controlled open-label pilot trial of fecal microbiotatransplantationFMTforCHBpatients.Methods and ResultsIn the present study 18 eligible patients who remained persistently positive for HBeAg following3 years of ongoing ETV- or TDF-based antiviral therapy were enrolled Table 1.

After obtaining written informed con- sents FMT treatment was performed by gastroscope for the participants in the FMT arm every 4 weeks until HBeAg clearance was achieved.

Principal components analysis showed that the gut microbiota profile of the donors was distinct from that of the participants in the FMT arm at baseline  .At the end of follow-up a significant decline in HBeAg titer rather than hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg titer was observed in the FMT arm compared to that at the baseline Fig.

Moreover HBeAg titer declined gradually after each round of FMT .

In contrast to that none of the control patients achieved HBeAg clearance 0 of 13 at the conclusion of the study P 5 0.0001 Mantel-Cox's test Fig.
