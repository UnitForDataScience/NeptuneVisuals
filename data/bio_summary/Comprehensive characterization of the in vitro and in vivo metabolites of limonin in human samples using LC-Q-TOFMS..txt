neutral loss of the ester group in lactonic ring d produces mz 425.1942. the loses of the epoxy group and the lactone ring a result in the fragment ion of mz 367.1895 and mz 339.1946 respectively.

the fragmentation ofmz 161.0604 is similar to those observed for parent drug and other metabolites which suggests the existence of furan ring on ring d. the mz 409 and 349 fragmentation ions suggest the loss of ester group from two lactones in ring a and ring d. the structure of m5 is corre- sponding with the natural constituent deoxylimonin .metabolite m6m6 eluted at 11.32 min and the positive ion was observed at mz 505.2048 which is 34 da higher than limonin.

the fragmentation ion of mz 259 indicates the carbonyl group deleted from ring b.metabolite m7m7 eluted at 12.02 min and the positive ion was observed at mz 485.2160 which is 14 da higher than limonin.

the fragmentation ion at mz 95.0514 was also observed in the metabolite and the fragmentation ion at mz 453 which suggests the loss of methoxy group in ring a.fig.

all metabolites at mz 161 and mz 95 indicate the characteristic fragmentation in this type compound as described in previous literature .

the ion at mz 455.2067 indicates the deletion of the hydroxyl group in ring bwhich is 18 da lower than the molecular ion.

the peak retention time of m2 is at 10.89 min and the positive ion was detected at mz 487.1951 which is 16 da higher than the ion of limonin suggesting an additional oxygen group.

in our experi- ments most of the metabolites of limonin in humans were identified as same as those in plants suggesting that they have the similar metabolic pathways.conclusionsin conclusion the metabolites of limonin in human urine feces and intestinal bacteria was analyzed and compared using lc-q-tofms.

the positive ion of limonin was detected at mz 471.1988 and other data was summarized in .
