For CD19-CAR T-cell therapy in which CD19-CAR T cells were infused to mice after CTX-preconditioning the survival rate in mice on normal drinking water was not statistically different from that in mice on antibiotics Figure 5C H2O CTXCD19CAR versus Abx CTXCD19CAR.We collected peripheral blood from a cohort of mice at different time points to examine the impact of antibiotics administration on the presence of the donor T cells as well as the occurrence of B-cell aplasia.

Under normal water condition CTX treatment transiently delayed tumor growth in Rag2KO mice Figure 1C H2O CTX vs. H2O no Tx however the process of tumor regression which was observed in CTX-treated wild-type mice Figure 1A did not occur in Rag2KO mice following CTX treatment.

In other words antibiotics administration which caused faster tumor regrowth in CTX-treated wild-type mice did not cause differences in tumor regrowth kinetics in immunodeficient mice afterFigure 1 Antibiotics administration diminishes the efficacy of CTX in mice with B-cell lymphoma by attenuating CTX-elicited antitumor T cell responses.

Notably relapses occurred earlier in antibiotics-treated mice than in antibiotics-naive mice.

Furthermore antibiotics administration neither affected tumor growth rate in untreated mice nor altered the tumor growth kinetics in CTX-treated mice.

Figure 5A shows that it took only 10 PCR cycles to enter the log phase of amplification of bacteria DNA in fecal samples collected from water-drinking mice while more than 40 PCR cycles were needed to amplify bacteria DNA in fecal samples collected from mice under antibiotics.

Furthermore mice exposed to antibiotics exhibited enlarged cecum Figure 5B which is commonly seen in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice.Figure 2 Antibiotics administration results in diminished T cell activation in CTX-treated mice.

Figure 5D shows that donor T cell frequencies were mostly comparable in antibiotics-treated mice compared to antibiotics-naive mice at the time points examined.

Notably B cells started to re-emerge in antibiotics-naive mice at later times 2 out of 5 on day 20 4 out 5 on day 35 whereas B-cell aplasia persisted in antibiotics-treated mice.

Figure 5E shows that among the CD45.1 donor cells found in spleens CAR-expressing cells were nearly absent in antibiotics-naive mice but easily detectable in antibiotics-treated mice.
