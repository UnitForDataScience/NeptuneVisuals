in viola's group close grooming partners had more similar core gut microbiota and trended toward significance for non-core microbiota partial mantel tests controlling for kinship core microbiome r 0.071 p 0.009 non-core micro- biome r 0.051 p 0.0549 partial mantel tests controlling for diet core microbiome r 0.064 p 0.047 non-core microbiome r 0.0597 p 0.06. we did not find that grooming partners had more similar microbiomes in mica's group par- tial mantel tests controlling for kinship core micro- biome r 0.085 p 0.11 non-core microbiome r 0.083 p 0.12 partial mantel tests controlling for diet core microbiome r 0.0725 p 0.18 non-core microbiome r 0.1298 p 0.065. however when we re-defined the non-core micro- biome as taxa present in 50 of samples grooming relationship strength significantly predicted gut mi- crobial similarity for mica's group supplementary results partial mantel tests controlling for kinship r 14 0.143 p 14 0.024 partial mantel tests controllingfor diet r 0.154 p 0.034. further the similar core microbiome effect sizes in both groups suggests that the lack of a significant relationship in mica's group may be due to lower statistical power smaller sample size than in viola's group.

we set the kruskal-wallis alpha level to 0.01 and the threshold on the logarithmic lda scale to 3.0.to test whether close grooming partners had more similar core and non-core microbiomes than indi- viduals who rarely groomed each other we ran par- tial mantel tests on matrices of within-group beta diversity and grooming bond strength controlling for kinship or diet for each social group using the vegan package in r supplementary tables s4-s7 .testing h3 immigrant males who join a social group acquire their new group's gut microbiomewe averaged the weighted unifrac values between a sample from an immigrant male and samples from all other adult residents of the group who had been members of the social group for 21 year.

indeed group members are proposed to serve as res- ervoirs for core microbes and it may be advanta- geous for a host to access a social reservoir of core microbes to recover after an illness or to adapt to local circumstances  .finally other aspects of group living besides so- cial transmission may influence the abundance of core and non-core gut microbial taxa--at least at the social group level.

prior re- search on this population indicated that each social group harbored distinct gut microbiomes and that close grooming partners have more similar gut microbiomes than those who rarely groom each other .here we expanded both the sample size and scope of our analyses to test three main hypotheses for both the core and non-core microbiome 1 that sociality is linked to elevated gut microbial alpha diversity 2 that increased social interactionpromotes increased gut microbial similarity beta di- versity between individuals and 3 that the length of an immigrant male's membership in his current social group predicts his microbiome similarity to long-term group residents.

we found that viola's group had a larger group-specific core microbiome than mica's group  with 270 group-specific core otus in viola's group while mica's group only had 218 group-specific core otus .contrary to our predictions we found no evi- dence that individuals with more diverse grooming relationships had higher gut microbial alpha diver- sity.

however this mechanism cannot explain within so- cial group effects such as those linked to grooming relationships because members of the same social group experience very similar environmental expo- sures and controlling for habitat use does not remove the effects of grooming on gut microbial similarity .regardless of the underlying explanation for whysocial effects extend to both the core and non-core microbiome social structuring in the core micro- biome could have functional consequences for hosts.

indeed there was no relationship between an individual's grooming partner diversity and micro- biome diversity for any measure of alpha diversity in either the core microbiome or the non-core micro- biome p  0.28 for all linear mixed models.social effects on gut microbial beta diversity include the core microbiomeas in previous work in this population   we found that members of the same social group harbored more similar gut microbiomes than members of different social groups.

social group membership explained 13.9 of the variance in gut microbial composition for the non-core microbiome permanova of weighted unifrac distances non-core microbiome permuted r2 0.139 per- muted p 0.001  and 4.7 for the core microbiome permanova of weighted unifrac distances core microbiome permuted r2 0.0477 permuted p 0.007  even though core microbiome taxa by definition occurred in subjects from both groups.

however we found that for both the core and non- core microbiome individuals living in the larger so- cial group viola's exhibited higher gut microbial otu richness than individuals in the smaller social group and .

taken together our results suggest that if greater core microbial diversity is both biologically signifi- cant and beneficial higher gut microbial alpha diver- sity may constitute a benefit of living in a large social group with a large home rangedispersal and the local microbiomein baboons and many other animals the conse- quences of dispersal can range from higher risk of predation and difficulty finding food in unfamiliar habitats to new reproductive opportunities and im- proved social status  .

finally the genera prevotellahost social behavior and gut microbial alpha diversitya growing number of studies propose that social partners serve as reservoirs of gut microbial diversity and individuals with more social partners should ex- hibit higher gut microbial diversity than socially iso- lated animals    .

here we used 178 samples from 78 wild yellow baboons papio cynocephalus living in two social groups to test how host social context including group living social interactions within groups and transfer between social groups e.g.

the 219 core otus used in many of our analyses include 183 otus that are part of the core microbiome in both social groups 1 otu that is part of mica's core but not viola's and 35 otus that are part of viola's core but not mica's.
