A researcher interested in fine-tuning the evolutionary assumptions in phylofactorization can define an objective function that increases explicitly with the length of the edge being considered to reflect an assumption that the probability of a trait arising increases with the amount of time elapsed.Each edge identified in phylofactorization corresponds to two bins of taxa on each side of the edge and consequently phylofactorization brings in two complementary perspectives for analyzing the data factor-based analysis and bin-based analysis.

Finally future research can investigate the unique kinds of errors in phylofactorization in addition to the multiple-hypothesis testing ofedges phylofactorization may propagate errors in the greedy algorithm and even when taxa are correctly factored into the appropriate functional bins the presence of multiple factors in the same region of the tree can lead to uncertainty about the exact edge along which a putative trait arose see for more discussion on the uncertainty of which edge to annotate.Incorporating that phylogenetic structure into the analysis of microbiome datasets has been a major challenge  and now phylofactorization provides a general framework for rigorous exploration of phylogenetically-structured compositional datasets.

Instead of principle components analysis or principle coordinates analysis phylofactorization can be used as for exploratory data analysis and dimensionality reduction tool in which the ''components'' are identifiable clades in the tree of life a far more intuitive and informative component for biological variation than multi-species loadings.Phylofactorization can allow researchers to annotate online databases of the microbial tree of life permitting predictions about the physiology of unclassified and uncharacterizedlife forms based on previous phylogenetic inferences in sequence-count data.

While many tools exist for the nominally similar task of ''using the phylogeny to analyze microbiome data'' the utility of phylofactorization lies in its ability to construct variables corresponding to edges in the phylogeny along which putative functional ecological traits may have arisen constructed so as to avoid nested dependence and overlapping comparisons that frequent the analysis of hierarchically structured and constructed in a manner appropriate for compositional data.Future workThe generality of phylofactorization opens the door to future work employing phylofactorization with other objective functions.

While traditional ordination-visualization tools may capture larger fractions of variation ofthe data phylogenetic factorization yields a few variables--ratios of clades--which capture large blocks of variation in the data and can be traced to single edges in the phylogeny corresponding to meaningful splits between taxa edges where traits likely arose whichgovern the differential abundances across sample sites and environmental gradients or responses to treatments  -.Using the KS-test stopping criterion phylofactorization was terminated at 142 factors each corresponding to a branch in the phylogenetic tree separating two groups of OTUs based on their differential abundances in the tongue and feces.

The amount of variance explained was measured as the difference in the null deviance and the model deviance summed across all three factors or the top 3 ILR coordinates.KS-based stopping function for phylofactorWhile a researcher can iterate through phylofactorization until a full basis of D - 1 ILR coordinates is constructed the researcher may be interested in stopping the iteration before the full basis is constructed and focus their analysis and interpretations on a conservative subset of the true number of phylogenetic factors.

The log-ratio used in phylofactor is an averaged ratio of abundances of taxa on two sides of an edge see for more detail thus phylofactorization searches the tree for the edge which has the most predictable difference between taxa on each side of the edge or put differently the edge which best differentiates taxa on each side.

Subsequent factors will split the bins from previous steps and after n iterations one has n factors that can be mapped to the phylogeny n1 bins for binning taxa based on their phylogenetic factors n estimates of ILR balancing elements and an orthonormal ILR basis that can be used to project the data onto a lower dimensional space.

16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess bacterial and archaeal diversity and 18S markers for Eukaryotic diversity is now one of the most commonly used approaches for describing microbial communities quantifying the relative abundances of individual microbial taxa and characterizing how microbial communities change across space time or in response to known biotic or abiotic gradients.Analyzing these data is challenging due to the peculiar noise structure of sequence- count data  the inherently compositional nature of the data  deciding the taxonomic scale of investigation     and the high-dimensionalityof species-rich microbial communities .

Throughout our results we emphasize that the phylogenetic inferences made by phylofactorization could be invisible to taxonomic-based analyses and we conceptually compare the dimensionality-reductions of phylofactorizationto the less-interpretable output from standard ordination-visualization tools.Power analysis and conservative stopping of phylofactorization Phylofactorization remedies the structured residuals from the rooted ILR regression on data with fold-changes in abundances within clades.
