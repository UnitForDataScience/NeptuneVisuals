Due to the nature of its rapid response and short half-life C-reactive protein CRP acts as a useful marker of inflammation especially in the management of CD.But the CRP level is dependent on the site and number of active CD lesions and is therefore not specific.67Recently magnetic resonance imaging MRI has become the primary imaging tool for evaluation of disease activity in patients with CD because of the advantages of lack of ionizing radiation exposure and the ability to assess for both intestinal and extra- intestinal disease activity.8-10 Compared with conventionalimaging newly emerging functional techniques such as dynamic contrast enhanced MRI DCE-MRI provide advantages in extraction of lesion mechanisms and offer more physiological information.DCE-MRI is currently used to evaluate treatment responses for malignant tumors including glioblastoma multiple myelo- ma breast cancer pancreatic cancer and prostatic carcinoma.Meanwhile studies have employed this technique to assess neovascularization in inflammatory diseases.1617 We have assessed the role of DCE-MRI in diagnosis and assessment for CDsuch findings are similar to other researches.19-21 In this paper we present a preliminary study of CD by DCE-MRI and hypothesize that the parameters of DCE-MRI can be used to evaluate the therapeutic response.Material and methodsThis research was conducted from June 1 2014 to January 31 2016.

Assessment of therapeutic response in Crohn's disease using quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced MRI DCE-MRI parametersA preliminary studyJianguo Zhu MD PhDa Faming Zhang MDb Jinfa Zhou MDa Haige Li MDaAbstractThe aim of the study was to investigate dynamic contrast enhanced MRI DCE-MRI as a potential marker to assess the therapeutic responses of fecal microbiota transplantation FMT in patients with Crohn's disease CD and to determine the parameter or combination of parameters most strongly associated with changes in clinical indicators after treatment.In 22 CD patients DCE-MRI was performed with a 3.0T scanner.

Can dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI DCE-MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI DW-MRI evaluate inflam- mation disease a preliminary study of Crohn's disease.

Compared to DKtrans and DBV individually the combination of both parameters performed best in assessment of therapeutic response with an area under the ROCs AUC of 0.948.Ktrans and BV parameters derived from DCE-MRI have the potential to assess for therapeutic response after FMT treatment for CD.

Among all 22 subjects 6 patients were considered to have poor treatment outcomes due to increased CRP and HBI values compared to pretreatment 2.Reproducibility of MRI parameter measurementsThere were 88 MRI sets in total including 44 sets for Ktrans each 22 sets in pre- and post-treatment and 44 sets for BV each 22 sets in pre- and post-treatment.
