due to the nature of its rapid response and short half-life c-reactive protein crp acts as a useful marker of inflammation especially in the management of cd.but the crp level is dependent on the site and number of active cd lesions and is therefore not specific.67recently magnetic resonance imaging mri has become the primary imaging tool for evaluation of disease activity in patients with cd because of the advantages of lack of ionizing radiation exposure and the ability to assess for both intestinal and extra- intestinal disease activity.8-10 compared with conventionalimaging newly emerging functional techniques such as dynamic contrast enhanced mri dce-mri provide advantages in extraction of lesion mechanisms and offer more physiological information.dce-mri is currently used to evaluate treatment responses for malignant tumors including glioblastoma multiple myelo- ma breast cancer pancreatic cancer and prostatic carcinoma.meanwhile studies have employed this technique to assess neovascularization in inflammatory diseases.1617 we have assessed the role of dce-mri in diagnosis and assessment for cdsuch findings are similar to other researches.19-21 in this paper we present a preliminary study of cd by dce-mri and hypothesize that the parameters of dce-mri can be used to evaluate the therapeutic response.material and methodsthis research was conducted from june 1 2014 to january 31 2016. all patients agreed to participate in a clinical trial of fmt for cd nct01793831 at the second affiliated hospital of nanjing medical university.

in the current study choosing crp and hbi as reference was based on following reasons 1 surgery is not the preferred treatment for cd so it is difficult to obtain pathological samples 2 mvd reports only a morphologic index of vasculature and cannot differentiate between functional vessels whereas dce-mri parameters reflect those vessels with active perfusion 3 crp and clinical scores have been set as gold-standard in previous dce-mri researches1618 4 crp and hbi are important monitoring tools in the clinical management of cd.2930figure 6. the assessment efficacy of different mri parameters for therapeutic response to treatment.
