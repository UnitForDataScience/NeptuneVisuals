in contrast the phenolic natural productreceived october 12 2017published december 13 2017c 2017 american chemical society118doi honokiol has received attention due to the reportedly potent inhibitory activity against s. mutans b.although isolated and first reported in 1982 from the bark or seeds of a magnolia tree honokiol has been used as a therapeutic in chinese japanese and korean traditional herbal remedies for centuries.

these findingssuggest that compounds c2 and b5 may be inhibiting the growth of s. mutans by different mechanisms.research has focused mainly on the antitumor antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities of honokiol resulting in the identification of various cellular targets.-in contrast the mechanism of action of honokiol or the derivatives reported in these oral pathogens has been elusive.

b the natural product honokiol has been previously reported to inhibit s. mutans growth.

these results demonstrate that although s. mutans growth is inhibited by honokiol the overall efficacy of the compound will be less under physiological conditions.
