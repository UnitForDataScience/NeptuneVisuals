batches with the same total am class usage might relate to use in different units thus the rearing period and the occurrence of amr for these finisher batches may not be identical due to rapid change in the occurrence of amr  .in this study three different approaches for calcu- lating use of am at finisher batch level were devel- oped.

amr results for finishers can therefore be obtained at time of slaughter without consideration for rearing site s. the objectives of the study were to i develop three different approaches for calculating am use at finisher batch level taking into account the rearing period and rearing site and ii compare the associ- ation with measured amr in composite faeces sam- ples from 10 batches of finishers.methods data sourcesdata on the farms and number of pigs were obtained from the national chr where all farms with produc- tion animals are recorded  .

the effect b the p-value p and the r2 value are shown in the top left corner of each model.only 10 finisher batches no attempt was made to con- duct an analytical adjustment of a potential confound- ing effect from herd or farm management.it is notable that the results of the regression models for four out of six combinations of lifetime exposure vs amr obtained by wcs  gave significant results as did three out of six combinations of herd exposure vs amr obtained by wcs .

the fact that overall the r2 models of lifetime exposure explain more of the variation in amr com- pared with herd exposure indicates that lifetime exposure has the strongest effect on amr in finisher batches.

no effect of finisher unit exposure on amr could be demonstrated however use of am in this unit is limited in terms of both am classes and amounts .in this study a significant quantitative association could be demonstrated for lifetime exposure of tetra- cycline on amr across methods of obtaining resist- ance  and  which is in alignment with2836v.

overall this study showed that the entire rearing period should be taken into account when studying the association between amr and am use and revealed that the method developed for calcu- lating lifetime exposure is an efficient measurement of the effect of am use on amr found in finisher batches.by using metagenomics we measured the relative abundance of specific genes in the faeces.

the quantitativeeffect of exposure for the am classes aminoglycoside lincosamide macrolide broad-spectrum penicillin sulfonamide and tetracycline measured as finisher unit exposure lifetime exposure and herd exposure on similar amr gene abundance was cal- culated using simple linear regression and as a meas- ure of model fit the coefficient of determination r2 was applied.

the regression analyses revealed a significant effect of herd exposure for the am classes aminoglycoside lincosamide and tetracycline on the amr genes for aminoglycoside lincosamide and tetracycline respectively .the regression models were re-analysed excluding the most extreme data point of each set to assess the robustness of the significant results.
