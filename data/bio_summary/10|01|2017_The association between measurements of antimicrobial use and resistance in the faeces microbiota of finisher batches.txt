The fact that overall the R2 models of Lifetime Exposure explain more of the variation in AMR com- pared with Herd Exposure indicates that Lifetime Exposure has the strongest effect on AMR in finisher batches.

The quantitativeeffect of exposure for the AM classes aminoglycoside lincosamide macrolide broad-spectrum penicillin sulfonamide and tetracycline measured as Finisher Unit Exposure Lifetime Exposure and Herd Exposure on similar AMR gene abundance was cal- culated using simple linear regression and as a meas- ure of model fit the coefficient of determination R2 was applied.

The coefficient of determination R2 analyses of the models with significant results revealed that the variation of AMR that could be explained by the Lifetime Exposure measurements varied from 042 tetracyc- line to 072 sulfonamide for the variables  and  and from 047 aminoglycoside to 067 linco- samide for the Herd Exposure measurements .DISCUSSION Independent variablesThe exposure measurements were derived from differ- ent data sources thereby integrating any errors of the sources in the daily ADDkg.The length of the rearing period influences the expos- ure measurements however this study did not deter- mine whether the rearing periods should be longer or overlapped in order to assess the effect on the occur- rence of AMR genes.

The effect b the P-value P and the R2 value are shown in the top left corner of each model.only 10 finisher batches no attempt was made to con- duct an analytical adjustment of a potential confound- ing effect from herd or farm management.It is notable that the results of the regression models for four out of six combinations of Lifetime Exposure vs AMR obtained by WCS  gave significant results as did three out of six combinations of Herd Exposure vs AMR obtained by WCS .

Numbers 1-5 denote the initially high users and 6-10 depict the initially low users.use on the average proportion of tetracycline-resistant aerobic bacteria .No significant effect was observed for Finisher Unit Exposure or Herd Exposure result not shown.Association between AM use and metagenomic measured resistanceNo significant effect was observed of Finisher Unit Exposure for any of the AM classes on their respective AMR gene classes result not shown.

The AM use was calculated relative to the rearing period of the batches as i 'Finisher Unit Exposure' at unit level ii 'Lifetime Exposure' at batch level andiii 'Herd Exposure' at herd level.

No effect of Finisher Unit Exposure on AMR could be demonstrated however use of AM in this unit is limited in terms of both AM classes and amounts .In this study a significant quantitative association could be demonstrated for Lifetime Exposure of tetra- cycline on AMR across methods of obtaining resist- ance  and  which is in alignment with2836V.

The validity of these assessments willimprove the robustness and precision of the decisions about interventions targeted against reducing the occurrence of AMR in pigs.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The supplementary material for this article can be found at 5.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank all the farmers for participating in this study.FUNDING This work was supported by the Danish Ministry of Food Agriculture and Fisheries.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.REFERENCES WHO.
