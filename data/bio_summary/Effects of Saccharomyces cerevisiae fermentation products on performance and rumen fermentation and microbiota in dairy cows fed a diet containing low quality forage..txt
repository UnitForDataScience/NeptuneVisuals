Feeding ruminal fermentation modifiers has been shown as a cost-effective and safe way to maximize feed utilization of low-quality forage and thereby improve milk production .Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product SCFP Original XP Diamond V Cedar Rapids IA USA is one of the most widely used rumen fermentation modifiers.

Effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on ruminal fermentation and nutrient utilization in dairy cows.

Effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on in vitro fermentation and microbial communities of low-quality forages and mixed diets.

The SCFP Original XP a fully fermented yeast culture con- taining residual yeast cells fermentation metabolites and growth media was from Diamond V Cedar Rapids Iowa USA.

The increased total VFA concentrations with SCFP supplementation indicated stimulated rumen microbial fermentation ac- tivities and help support the milk production and per- sistency as was observed in the present study.

Such effects have also been reported in earlier studies  The reduction of lactate-producing bacteria S. bovis in the present study could contribute to the stability of rumen fermentation.
