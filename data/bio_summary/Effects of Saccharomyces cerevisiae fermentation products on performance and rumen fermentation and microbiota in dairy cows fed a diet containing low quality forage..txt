feeding ruminal fermentation modifiers has been shown as a cost-effective and safe way to maximize feed utilization of low-quality forage and thereby improve milk production .saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product scfp original xp diamond v cedar rapids ia usa is one of the most widely used rumen fermentation modifiers.

these effects may be the results of scfp favorably altered ruminal microbial fermentation by stimulating the growth and activity of fiber-digesting bac- teria increasing fiber digestion increasing microbial protein mcp synthesis stimulating growth of lactate- utilizing bacteria and decreasing accumulation of lactate -.

thus the objective of the current study was to investigatethe effects of several levels of scfp on dry matter intake dmi milk production rumen fermentation and micro- bial communities in dairy cows fed a diet containing low quality forage.methodsanimalsthe animal care committee of zhejiang university ap- proved the use of animals for this experiment hangzhou china.

milk yield had an increasing trend linear p  0.08 with the increasing amount of scfp supplementation table energy- corrected milk ecm was not affected by scfp supple- mentation p  0.05. feed efficiency ecmdmi waswere supplemented to scfp for an extended period of time.rumen fermentation parametersrumen ph and ammonia-n concentration were similar p  0.05 among the treatments table greater feeding rate of scfp increased linear p  0.01 concentrations of total vfa acetate propionate and butyrate with no difference p  0.05 in molar proportion of individual acids and acetate to propionate ratio table not affected p  0.05 whereas n conversion milk pro- tein yielddietary cp intake increased linearly p  0.05 with the increasing amount of scfp.

the increased total vfa concentrations with scfp supplementation indicated stimulated rumen microbial fermentation ac- tivities and help support the milk production and per- sistency as was observed in the present study.

in vivo and in vitro studies have documented positive effects of scfp on rumen fermentation increases in rumen propionate have also been observed in previ- ous studies when scfp was fed higher propionic acid concentrations observed with scfp in the current study would lead to an increased glucogenic potential of the diet and milk production.it is reported that variable response in vfa pro- duction and pattern with yeast culture supplementa- tion is a consequence of yeast culture's effect on the growth of different species of rumen microbes  rumen microbial populations detected in the currentstudy were altered in response to scfp supplemen- tation.

such effects have also been reported in earlier studies  the reduction of lactate-producing bacteria s. bovis in the present study could contribute to the stability of rumen fermentation.

the effects of scfp were dose-dependent and greater effects being observed with higher levels.abbreviationsadf acid detergent fiber bw body weight cp crude protein dim days in milk dm dry matter mcp microbial crude protein me metabolizable energy n nitrogen ndf neutral detergent fiber pd purine derivatives scfp saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product tmr total mixed ration vfa volatile fatty acidsacknowledgmentsthe authors gratefully thank all of the staff of the hangjiang dairy farm hangzhou china for their assistance in milking and care of the animals.
