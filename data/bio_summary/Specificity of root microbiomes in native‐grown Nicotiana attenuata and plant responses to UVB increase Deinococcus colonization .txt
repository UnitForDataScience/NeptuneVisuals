5C D.UVB irradiance increases Deinococcus citri-D61 root colonization of WT host plants but decreases colonization of plants impaired in the perception of and response to UVBTo evaluate the influence of UVB perception and down- stream response on Deinococcus root colonization we used WT plants and plants from the newly generated NaUVR8-silenced line irCHAL plants impaired in flavo- noid biosynthesis Kessler et al.

We har- vested nine plants from the Gate G Wash W LytleL locations and three plants from Burn B and Pah- coon Spring P. Except for some plants of the Wash population all plants were in the elongating stage of growth which marks the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth for this annual plant.

Based on these results we infer that N. attenuata does not harbour a seedborne micro- biome and plants recruit microbial communities from the surrounding soil during germination and plant development.Native root microbiomes are dominated by Actinobacteria Deinococcus-Thermus and TM7 bacteria phyla and Ascomycota fungal phyla irrespective of locationsTo investigate the recruitment of the N. attenuata root bacterial communities across native populations of plants we sampled native-grown N. attenuata roots and bulk soil from five different locations at the Great Basin Desert Utah USA Fig.

Fungal community diversity was higher among the samples and location had a more pronounced effect on the community com- position even though Ascomycota clearly dominated all root and soil samples.Core root bacterial and fungal communities of native- grown N. attenuata rootsTo robustly analyse the influence of location on the root microbiome of native-grown N. attenuata we further investigated at a lower taxonomic level which taxa are present in all root samples and whether taxa are unique to locations.

With UVB supplementation root colonization of Deinococcus increased in wild type but decreased in irUVR8 and irCHAL plants compared to nontreated plants.

6 UVB supplementation significantly increases the root colonization with Deinococcus citri-D61 and total phenolics in WT plants while colonization decreases and total phenolics remain unchanged in plants impaired in UVB perception and response.

Although UVB- induced changes in the microbiome of above-ground tissues of plants have been shown the effect of UVB on the root microbiome is unexplored and it remains unknown whether and how recruitment of root bacteria is related to the perception of UVB by UVR8 and its downstream responses that include the elicitation of CHS.Coyote tobacco Nicotiana attenuata germinates from long-lived seed banks in the typically nitrogen-rich soils of the postfire environment Lynds  Baldwin 1998 Preston  Baldwin 1999 Baldwin 2001.

To further investigate whether UV-Bperception and response influenced root colonization by native Deinococcus isolates we conducted a microcosm experiment using a synthetic bacterial community con- sisting of four native strains isolated from the field to test the hypothesis that the plant's response to UVB radiation its perception UVR8 and response CHAL influence the root colonization.Materials and methodsSample collectionNicotiana attenuata plants were collected in 2013 from five different locations in the Great Basin Desert Utah USA Burn N 37.3332 W 113.9388 a.s.l.1337 m Pah-coon Spring N 37.2381 W 113.8284 a.s.l.

From these results we infer that the plants enrich a core bacterial and fungal community but the site-specific root colonization by fungi is higher than it is for bacteria and as a consequence sampling location had a larger influence on the root fungal com- munities than on the bacterial communities.Deinococcus-Thermus taxa are enriched inN.

In this work we expanded our analysis to the seedborne microbiome to evaluate whether a core group of microbes is transmitted to the offspring and serves as primary source for root colonization and characterized the root microbiota of N. attenuata plants from different natural populations grown at different locations in their native habitat.
