The interest in determining and predicting key factors in the establishment and maintenance of the gut microbiome is the major goal of several works         .Diet is a major modulator of the composition of the gut microbiome and the nature of these substrates probably dictates which species predominate.

For example acetate has been shown to prevent pathogen colonization   and lactate in the adult gut microbiome is used by butyrate-producing bacteria   a health-promoting SCFA  .Finally this model could be useful to study interactions using a more complex set of species of gut microbiome species.

After curation and defining specific environments and constraints microbial interactions can be obtained for a few species  .Recently a kinetic model constructed from experimental data of gut microbes in a bioreactor was presented aimed to model the dynamic behavior of the gut microbiome  .

The gut microbiome coexists with the host and deploys important functions that impact host metabolism and gut physiology  .

Understanding the forces that guide microbiome development and composition is important to determine its role in health and in the intervention of the gut microbiome as a therapeutic tool.

Moreover the model could be useful in designing microbial consortia with desired properties such as higher acid production.Keywords metabolic interaction gut microbiome diet prebiotics mathematical modeling fructooligosaccharides FOSINTRODUCTIONThe human colonic microbiome is a complex microbial community that has a significant impact on host health.

One important factor shaping the early microbiome is the type of feeding   Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale   .Modeling-based approaches have been recently developed to study and predict the composition and interactions in the gut microbiome  .

Human breast milk containsmicrobial interactions among gut microbes large amounts of oligosaccharides HMO which are selectively utilized by beneficial gut microbes.

Moreover the gut epithelium is covered with a mucin layer containing oligosaccharides that could be used as carbon source by infant gut bacteria   .
