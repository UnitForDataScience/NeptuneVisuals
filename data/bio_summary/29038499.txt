Passive treatment had reducing AZ TF and PR and increasing DB effects whereas active treatment showed reducing effects in all samples.

A total of 6 OTUs were increased by active treatment and 14 OTUs by passive treatment.

While passive treatment showed a reduced efficacy active treatment was shown to substantially decrease the total number of bacteria in all samples with reduction rates up to 99.6.

While active evaporation was highly efficient in all experiments passive treatment showed reducing effects in two of four tested groups only.

This treatment ensures a high efficiency in the reduction of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in industrial-scale hatcheries.

The efficiency of the treatment was evaluated using growth dependent as well as independent methods.

The efficacy of two treatment strategies was evaluated using cultivation dependent methods analyzing colony forming units CFUs counts Fig.

Higher treatment efficiency is shown by lower CFU counts indicating a lower microbial load.
