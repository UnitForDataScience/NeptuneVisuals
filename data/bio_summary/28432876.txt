we hypothesize that chronic pistachio consump- tion could modulate urinary metabolites toward a healthier profile.therefore the aim of this study is to assess the effects of a pistachio-rich diet on different urine metabolites mainly those related with gut microbiota.material and methodsstudy characteristicsthe epirdem effect of pistachio intake on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus study is a randomized controlled crossover trial with two 4-month dietary intervention arms separated by 2-week washout period that was conducted in prediabetic subjects.

during the pistachio diet pd intervention participants were supplemented with 2 oz of pistachio 57 gday half roasted and half roasted and salted.adherence to the intervention period was assessed by counting the empty sachets of pistachio administered and measuring plasma lutein-zeaxanthin and g-tocopherol levels with a high-performance liquid chromatograph hplc coupled to a 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer qqqms agilent technologies palo alto u.s.a. as previously described .1h-nmr-based targeted metabolomic profilingtwenty-four-hour urine collection and storagetwenty-four hour pooled urine samples were collected both at baseline and at the end of each dietary intervention period.

after the run-in period subjects were randomized to one of the two diet sequences starting with a control diet cd followed by the pistachio-supplemented diet pd or starting with the pd followed by the cd.

the highest absolute values for the loadings data not shown were projected into the first and second component and concur with metabolites significantly modulated in the univariate analysis.discussionin the present study we demonstrated that chronic consumption of pistachio in the context of a healthy diet modifies the 24-h urine profile of gut-microbiota-related metabolites in prediabetic subjects.

among the limitations our study was conducted in prediabetic subjects thus limiting the extrapolation of our findings to other individuals.chronic consumption of pistachios in the context of a healthy diet has a different urine metabolic fingerprinting compared with a nut-free diet.

moreover in the absence of fecal samples an alternative for determining the nutritional modulation of the gut microbiota is by evaluating the different metabolites generated or catabolized by them in fluids such as urine because gut microbiota composition and different urine or plasma metabolite signatures are highly correlated .we have previously demonstrated that pistachio consumptionmodulates insulin resistance ir status and cvd markers at systemic cellular and molecular levels .however there are no previous studies evaluating changes in urinary metabolome after chronic pistachio consumption that could help to further understand molecular consequences of their health benefit properties.

twenty-four-hour urine data were finally available in 39 participants 5 participantsdropped out of the study for personal reasons 7 did not collect urine samples in at least one visit and 3 exhibited highly reduced levels of plasma biomarkers of pistachio consumption during pd supple- mentary fig.

significant changes in urine metabolites according to the different intervention periods were found in uni- and multivariate analysis.

they consumed a pistachio-supplemented diet pd 50 carbohydrates 33 fat including 57 gd of pistachios daily and a control diet cd 55 carbohydrates 30 fat for 4 months each separated by a 2-week wash-out.

regarding dietary modulation in the predimed trial a low-fat diet was associated to an increased 24-h urine hippurate and tmao levels compared with a mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts .

the subjects were instructed not to collect the first urine void in the morning on the first day but after this first void the urine collection continued until and including the morning urine void the following day.

nuclear magnetic resonance nrm was performed to determine changes in 24-h urine metabolites.

however to date no study has evaluated the effect of nut consumption on changes in gut-derived metabolites.
