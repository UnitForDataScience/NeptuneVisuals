More intense and detailed identification of microbiota strains specifically associated with DEC infections and disease is needed to pinpoint their role in DEC pathogenicity.Aim To identify resident indicative bacterial taxa in DEC-positive diarrhea stool samples of Chilean children.Methods We analyzed 63 diarrheal stool samples from children 1-5 years of age by FilmArrayr GI in order to identify a potential pathogen and to group diarrhea episodes into those caused by DEC as sole pathogen DEC group 32 samples and those caused by an enteric virus as sole pathogen viral group 31 samples.

The main goal of this study was to identify a distinctive gut microbiota in diarrheal samples positive for DEC pathotypes compared to diarrheal samples positive for enteric virus and stool samples from healthy children.PATIENTS AND METHODSStool SamplesDiarrheal stool samples were collected between January and December 2016 from children 1-5 years of age consulting at the outpatient clinic of Clinica Las Condes SantiagoNataro et al.

Indicative species have a high IndVal 0.28 and a low p-value 0.05.RESULTSTaxa Assignments Using OTUs and OPUsWe analyzed a total of 93 stool samples 32 diarrheal samples positive for at least one of the five DEC pathotypes DEC group 31 diarrheal samples positive only for enteric viruses viral group and 30 stool samples from healthy children healthy group.

Further studies including more samples from each of the various DEC pathotypes would allow to determine the microbiota associated to each DEC pathotypes and define if these infections should be analyzed individually or as a group.Among healthy children the gut microbiota has proven to be highly diverse during the early months of life.
