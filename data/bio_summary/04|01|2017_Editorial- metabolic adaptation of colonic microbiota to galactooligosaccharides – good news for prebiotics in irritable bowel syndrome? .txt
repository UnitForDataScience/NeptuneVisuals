There was no change in gastrointestinal symptoms and although there were no differences in specific bacterial taxa throughout the study volume of gas evacuated at the end of supplementation inversely correlated with abundances of certain intestinal bacteria including Lach- nospiraceae which is known to be fermentative.The apparent functional adaptation of the colonic microbiota to the administered prebiotic is interesting given the improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms after 4 weeks of supplementation of the same product in IBS mentioned above.3 However gas production and early symptom responses to the prebiotic were not measured in the study by Silk et al.

Clinical trial the effects of a trans- galactooligosaccharide prebiotic on faecal microbiota and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome.

designed a 3- week uncontrolled pilot study to assess the effect of galacto-oligosaccharide supplementation on symptoms intestinal gas production and the microbiota in 20 healthy subjects.8 The number and volume of anal gas evacua- tions significantly increased over the first 2 days of sup- plementation compared with baseline.

A key strength of this study was inclusion of clinical phys- iological and microbiota endpoints with the latter sur- prisingly often lacking in trials of pre- and probiotic supplementation but likely critical for an understanding of their mechanisms of action.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTDeclaration of personal and funding interests None.LINKED CONTENTThis article is linked to Mego et al and Manichanh and Accarino papers.
