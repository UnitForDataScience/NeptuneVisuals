Effect of the control diet 16 CP low CP diet 14 CP and low CP diet supplemented with 0.3 L-threonine on the abundance of intestinal opportunistic pathogen bacteria in laying hens.

Therefore a low CP  Thr diet was formulated by supplementing 0.3 L-Thr 98.5 purity Specom Biochemical Co. LTD Zhang Jiagang China to the low CP diet at the ex- pense of inert filler.

There were significant increases P  0.05 in intestinal sIgA levels in laying hens fed the low CP  Thr diet compared with the low CP diet however no significant differences were detected between the control and the low CP groups P  0.05 at wk 12.Table 3.
