Those abundances below 1 were classified as others including Deferribacteres Fusobacteria Verrucomicrobia Synergistetes TM7 and Lentisphaerae.DISCUSSIONIn the current study the low CP and the low CP  Thr diets were essentially isonitrogenous as only small amounts of Thr were added to the low CP diet and the analyzed CP content of the 2 diets was similar.

There were significant increases P  0.05 in intestinal sIgA levels in laying hens fed the low CP  Thr diet compared with the low CP diet however no significant differences were detected between the control and the low CP groups P  0.05 at wk 12.Table 3.

Thus we believe that any differences observed were due to the presence of Thr and not due to differences in the dietary CP levels between the low CP and low CP  Thr groups.

The impaired egg production and egg mass of hens fed the low CP diet were restored by dietary Thr supplementation indicating that Thr might be a limiting AA in the low CP diet of laying hens during the peak production period.

In conclusion dietary Thr supplemen- tation to a low CP diet could affect intestinal health and hence productivity via regulating intestinal mucin and sIgA expression and microbial population of laying hens.Key words threonine low crude protein mucin protein intestinal microbiota laying hens2017 Poultry Science 963654-3663 INTRODUCTIONThe excretion of N from dietary protein is mainly re- sponsible for the environmental N pollution caused by intensive livestock production Morse .

Therefore a low CP  Thr diet was formulated by supplementing 0.3 L-Thr 98.5 purity Specom Biochemical Co. LTD Zhang Jiagang China to the low CP diet at the ex- pense of inert filler.

Intestinal MUC2 mRNA level was higher P 0.05 in hens fed the low CP  Thr diet compared with the low CP diet and did not differ from that in the control group.

In total sequences from the intestinal microbiota could be classified into 58 genera with 55 genera in controls 53 genera in low CP samples and 58 genera in low CP Thr samples see Supplementary Table S1.

Of the total number of genera identified in the intestinal micro- biota 10 abundant genera  1 of the total DNA se- quences were detected in controls while 8 and 11 abun- dant genera were detected in low CP and low CP  Thr samples respectively Table .

Supplementing Thr to the low CP diet significantly increased P  0.05 the abundance of Bacteroides Clostridium Faecalibacterium Bifidobac- terium Parabacteroides and Eubacterium compared with those of low CP diet.
