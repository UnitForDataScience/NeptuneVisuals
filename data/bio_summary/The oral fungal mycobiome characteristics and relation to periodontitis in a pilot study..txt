genus candida previously associated with periodontal disease in culture-based studies had higher median relative abundance in participants with periodontal disease 33.2 compared to participants with oral health 2.2 though the difference was not significant p  0.52. additionally within the periodontal disease group median relative abundance of candida increased with increasing number of permanent teeth lost 1-2 teeth lost 3.2 3-4 teeth lost 16.6 5 teeth lost 73.9 p  0.11 though sample size was small for this analysis.conclusions in this first study comprehensively characterizing the oral mycobiome of adults with periodontal disease or good oral health we observed trends of higher candida abundance in participants with periodontal disease and participants with greater tooth loss.

as the bacterial origins of periodon- tal disease are well understood  future studies should examine interactions between fungal species and bacterial periodontal pathogens in the development and progression of periodontal disease such studies may uncover novel therapeutic approaches for the pre- vention and treatment of periodontal disease.conclusionsin conclusion we characterized the oral mycobiome in30 subjects providing further insight into the fungal make-up of the oral cavity and building upon the char- acterizations of previous studies by other groups though strong signatures related to periodontal disease were not observed this may relate to the small sample size and use of samples collected by oral rinse rather than subgingival samples.

while small sample size may have limited our power to detect significant associa- tions with periodontal disease our results suggest that candida species may be more highly abundant in the oral cavity of subjects with periodontal disease inagreement with previous reports  whether this may be a cause or consequence of periodontal disease remains to be determined from experimental studies.

subjects with periodontal disease were those who answered yes to the question has your dentist told you that you have periodontal disease with bone loss on a paper questionnaire.

overall fungal diversity in relation to periodontal disease the number of fungal otus per participant tended to be higher in the periodontal disease group than in the oral health group as did the evenness of the fungal com- munity fig.

fungal taxa in relation to periodontal diseasethe genus candida previously implicated in periodon- tal disease   was more abundant in participants with periodontal disease than participants with oral health median relative abundance  33.2 and 2.2 re- spectively though this difference was not significant p  0.52 fig.

these otus were no longer associated with periodontal disease after adjust- ment for multiple comparisons false discovery rate method.discussionin the current study characterizing the oral mycobiome of adults with periodontal disease or oral health we ob- served a small core set of genera species and otus that were shared by all or most participants and a much larger number of genera species and otus that were shared by few participants or unique to single partici- pants.

we aimed to describe and compare the oral mycobiome of subjects with and without periodontal disease.results we characterized the oral mycobiome in 30 adult subjects 15 with periodontal disease 15 with good oral health by sequencing the taxonomically informative pan-fungal internal transcribed spacer its gene in dna extracted from oral wash samples.

otus in participants with periodontal disease com- pared to oral health may indicate that periodontal dis- ease is associated with rare candida types.

interestingly fungi and bacteria can interact in several ways including physically chemically and metabolically to influence microbial survival colonization and biofilm formation candida albicans was previously shown to enhance porphyromonas gingivalis invasion of human gingival epithelial and fibroblast cells in vitro suggesting that candida albicans may contribute to periodontal pathogen initiation or exacerbation of periodontal disease.

an additional study limitation is the self-report of periodontal disease status which can potentially lead to disease misclassification.
