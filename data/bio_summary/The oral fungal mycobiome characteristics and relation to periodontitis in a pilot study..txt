As the bacterial origins of periodon- tal disease are well understood  future studies should examine interactions between fungal species and bacterial periodontal pathogens in the development and progression of periodontal disease Such studies may uncover novel therapeutic approaches for the pre- vention and treatment of periodontal disease.ConclusionsIn conclusion we characterized the oral mycobiome in30 subjects providing further insight into the fungal make-up of the oral cavity and building upon the char- acterizations of previous studies by other groups Though strong signatures related to periodontal disease were not observed this may relate to the small sample size and use of samples collected by oral rinse rather than subgingival samples.

Additionally within the periodontal disease group median relative abundance of Candida increased with increasing number of permanent teeth lost 1-2 teeth lost 3.2 3-4 teeth lost 16.6 5 teeth lost 73.9 p  0.11 though sample size was small for this analysis.Conclusions In this first study comprehensively characterizing the oral mycobiome of adults with periodontal disease or good oral health we observed trends of higher Candida abundance in participants with periodontal disease and participants with greater tooth loss.

While small sample size may have limited our power to detect significant associa- tions with periodontal disease our results suggest that Candida species may be more highly abundant in the oral cavity of subjects with periodontal disease inagreement with previous reports  Whether this may be a cause or consequence of periodontal disease remains to be determined from experimental studies.

Permutational multivariate ana- lysis of variance PERMANOVA  of the distance matrices was used to examine statistically whether overall fungal composition differed by periodontal status.Differential abundance by periodontal statusThe 8493 OTUs were agglomerated to 5 phyla 19 clas- ses 40 orders 63 families 81 genera and 154 species.Table 2 Candida and periodontal diseaseCarriage Relative abundance median IQRPeriodontal disease n  15Oral health n  15P-value Periodontal disease n  15Oral health n  15P-valueCandida genus100100NA33.2 0.9 72.72.2 0.4 580.52Candida albicans species6053.3317.5e-04 0 0.042.87e-04 0 0.010.56Candida dubliniensis species 26.672010 0 1.82e-040 0 00.6Candida parapsilosis species8086.6711.2e-03 5.8e-04 0.17.8e-04 4e-04 0.070.69Candida quercitrusa species 86.6773.330.657.6e-04 4.6e-04 1.9e-034.9e-04 7.8e-05 1.2e-030.35Candida sake species26.6713.330.650 0 1.2e-040 0 00.48Candida sp.

Genus Candida previously associated with periodontal disease in culture-based studies had higher median relative abundance in participants with periodontal disease 33.2 compared to participants with oral health 2.2 though the difference was not significant p  0.52.

Subjects with periodontal disease were those who answered yes to the question Has your dentist told you that you have periodontal disease with bone loss on a paper questionnaire.

Overall fungal diversity in relation to periodontal disease The number of fungal OTUs per participant tended to be higher in the periodontal disease group than in the oral health group as did the evenness of the fungal com- munity Fig.

Fungal taxa in relation to periodontal diseaseThe genus Candida previously implicated in periodon- tal disease   was more abundant in participants with periodontal disease than participants with oral health median relative abundance  33.2 and 2.2 re- spectively though this difference was not significant p  0.52 Fig.

These OTUs were no longer associated with periodontal disease after adjust- ment for multiple comparisons false discovery rate method.DiscussionIn the current study characterizing the oral mycobiome of adults with periodontal disease or oral health we ob- served a small core set of genera species and OTUs that were shared by all or most participants and a much larger number of genera species and OTUs that were shared by few participants or unique to single partici- pants.
