Furthermore numerous lymphocytes  and plasmatic cells Ig A-producing cells located near to epithelial cells were found in the apical border villi in the F4 group not shown.

Activated B lymphocytes interacted with absorptive cells immune cells and microbiota in the gut producing signals that were translated into a powerfulPeralta MF Magnoli A Alustiza F Nilson A Miazzo R and Vivas A 2017 Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue A Key Tissue Inside the Mucosal Immune System of Hens Immunized with Escherichia coli F4.Front.

As expected an increment in lymphocyte number in the lamina propria was detected in the F4 group.In concordance with the numerous plasmatic cells located near to the epithelial cells in the villi of F4 group samples the levels of secreted IgA were also significantly higher 1624 - 131 ngmLP  0.001 in the F4 than the Control group 230 - 41 ngmL.Furthermore average serum IgA concentration was signifi- cantly higher P  0.05 in the F4 group than the Control groupTaBle 1  germinal center area size mm2 in gut-associated lymphoid tissue and in the spleen of laying hens immunized with Escherichia coli F4 bacterin.The comparison was between groups F4 and Control into the same organ P  0.05 and P  0.001.Means that the difference between groups was significant.

This is closely related to tissue turnover in the crypt region and could be induced before bacterin immunization through dif- ferent bioactive molecules after the interaction between epithelial cells microbiota and immunological cells to conserve mucosal homeostasis     .

Moreover this increased number of lymphocytes inside the lamina propria of the ileum villi in the F4 group was consistent with the increased number of plasmatic cells registered between epithelial cells near the top of the villi data not shown.

There is a constant migration of Ag-primed immune cells from inductive to effector sites.

The interplay between micro- biota intestinal epithelium and the innate and adaptive immune cells is crucial for understanding homeostasis as it improves the dominance of regulatory networks that prevent inflammation or immune-mediated diseases.

Mononuclear cells were separated from the whole blood by using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077 Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA according to a previously established protocol .

The resulting buffy coat of white cells above the erythrocytes was collected and transferred to a fresh tube.
