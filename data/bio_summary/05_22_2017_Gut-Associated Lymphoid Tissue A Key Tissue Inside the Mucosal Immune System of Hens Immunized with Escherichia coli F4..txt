High serum IgA concentration P  0.001 was reached 4 weeks after the first immunization .In concordance with the expanded GC found in GALT and in the spleen higher percentages of B lymphocytes were found in the F4 group in the blood 11.8 vs. 7.8  and in the spleen 15.75 vs. 9.4  P  0.05.Moreover histological observations on the spleen corresponded well with the flow cytometry results.ig ProductionIn the F4 group total IgY serum levels were high for all assays P  0.001 high total IgY serum levels were reached at 2 weeks P  0.05 5 weeks P  0.001 and 7 weeks P  0.05 after thefirst immunization while IgY levels in the Control groups were kept to a minimum .In the yolk total IgY serum levels were already high after the first immunization in the F4 group reached a peak by 3 weeksP  0.001 a week after the first serum peak and they had clearly increased by 6 weeks P  0.001 a week after the second serum peak from where they increased until the end of the research .Anti E. coli F4-IgY levels in the serum remained high throughout the assay P  0.001.

As expected an increment in lymphocyte number in the lamina propria was detected in the F4 group.In concordance with the numerous plasmatic cells located near to the epithelial cells in the villi of F4 group samples the levels of secreted IgA were also significantly higher 1624 - 131 ngmLP  0.001 in the F4 than the Control group 230 - 41 ngmL.Furthermore average serum IgA concentration was signifi- cantly higher P  0.05 in the F4 group than the Control groupTaBle 1  germinal center area size mm2 in gut-associated lymphoid tissue and in the spleen of laying hens immunized with Escherichia coli F4 bacterin.The comparison was between groups F4 and Control into the same organ P  0.05 and P  0.001.Means that the difference between groups was significant.

Some specific IgY levels increased significantly after the first immunization in the F4 group high total anti-E. coli F4- IgY levels were reached at 3 weeks P  0.05 5 weeks P  0.001 and 8 weeks P  0.05 after the first immunization .In the yolk anti-E. coli F4-IgY levels were hugely P  0.001in the F4 group throughout the assay.

Furthermore numerous lymphocytes  and plasmatic cells Ig A-producing cells located near to epithelial cells were found in the apical border villi in the F4 group not shown.

P-values  0.05 were consid- ered statistically significant P  0.05 P  0.01 P  0.001.

Interestingly in GALT the immunization triggered a greater activation in Peyer's patches a fivefold increase P  0.001 as compared to theControl group  and in esophageal tonsils two-fold increase P  0.001 in the F4 group .In addition immunization triggered cecal and pyloric tonsil activation increased 10-fold P  0.05 in the F4 group as compared to the Control group.

This is closely related to tissue turnover in the crypt region and could be induced before bacterin immunization through dif- ferent bioactive molecules after the interaction between epithelial cells microbiota and immunological cells to conserve mucosal homeostasis     .

Moreover this increased number of lymphocytes inside the lamina propria of the ileum villi in the F4 group was consistent with the increased number of plasmatic cells registered between epithelial cells near the top of the villi data not shown.
