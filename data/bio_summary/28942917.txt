Together the above imaging analyses suggest gd IEL programs for steady-state surveillance and a swift reaction to luminal pathogens characterized by specific cell dynamics and positioning in the tissue.Coordinated EC-IEL Responses to Enteric PathogensTo gain insights into the mechanisms responsible for gd IEL behavioral responses to luminal microbes and the role of surrounding ECs in this process we performed parallel tran- scriptome analyses on sorted gd IELs and ECs from WT Salmo- nella-infected and naive control mice.

These analyses indicate that Salmonella infection swiftly induces a set of motility changes in gd IELs that is distinct from the one observed in response to commensal microbes.To evaluate whether this gd IEL behavioral response to Salmo- nella could be extended to additional small intestine pathogens we also investigated IEL movement following Toxoplasma gondii infection another pathogen to which IEL function has been pre- viously linked  .

However 4 weeks after tamoxifen treatment gd IEL dynamics acquired a ''GF-like'' profile with similar vertical distribution A vertical movement dynamics B and unique area coverage C Movie S4B suggesting that EC sensing of the microbiota impacts IEL behavior in the steady state.Next we examined whether gd IEL behavioral responses to enteric pathogens also require EC-specific Myd88 expression as suggested by the transcriptional analyses.

While the significance of this concom- itant EC-dependent modulation of gd IEL metabolism and behavior to gut physiology remains to be determined pharma- cological or cell-specific genetic targeting in either EC pathogen sensing or gd T cell glycolysis led to increased susceptibility to Salmonella invasion closely mirroring the phenotype of mice deficient in gd T cells .

These results suggest thata microbiota-sensing mechanism operates in the intestine to determine gd IEL intratissue distribution.We next used deep - 80 mm multiphoton intravital micro- scopy IVM to gain insight into the cell dynamics associated with gd IEL distribution.

Conventionalization of GF mice with total SPF microbiota or with SFB rescued gd IEL vertical displacement while 4 week treatment of SPF mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics mirrored GF gd IEL dynamics G and 1H Figure S1J.

Hence while TCR-dependent signals influ- ence gd IEL tissue seeding and homeostasis in the steady state  EC-specific Myd88 responses may supersede these signals during the gd IEL acute response to invading pathogens.

n  2 animals per group for iVilDMyd88 and control TCRgd.See also Figure S3.previously described for total TCRgd-deficient mice   we observed an increased incidence of early invasion of Salmonella in tamoxifen-treated iVilDMyd88 but not in littermate control mice E. The above data demonstrate that ECs are responsible for regulating gd IEL behavior in both the steady state and during infection in a Myd88-dependent and TCR-inde- pendent manner.Metabolic Regulation of gd IEL Behavior Metabolic reprogramming is essential for T cell clonal expansion and effector function  although its role in termi-nally differentiated and nonproliferative tissue-resident T cells is less understood.

Deletion of Myd88 in ECs completely abrogated the gd IEL metabolic response ECAR and OCR upregulation to Salmonella infection indicating that microbial sensing by ECs is required to regulate IEL energy utilization as well as their dynamic behavior C.The gene set enrichment analyses shown in suggest that the mTOR pathway may be involved in the increased meta- bolic response observed in gd IELs post-infection and this is similar to what has been described for activated effector T cells .

In the absence of infection induction of glycolysis was sufficient to trigger an array of gd IEL behavioral changes normally only observed after enteric infections while pharmacological or ge- netic inhibition of glycolysis prevented these infection-induced gd IEL dynamic changes.
