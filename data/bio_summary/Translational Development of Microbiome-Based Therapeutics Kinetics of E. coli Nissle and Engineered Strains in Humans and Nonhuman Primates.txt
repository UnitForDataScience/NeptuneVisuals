This method has a limit of detection of 20 and 40 copies of Nissle DNA per mg of extracted stool DNA for the two primer sets 16075 and 16073 respectively.In the nonclinical study in cynomolgus monkeys 109 or1012 CFU of EcN-derived strains were very well tolerated dur- ing 28 days of treatment despite the fact that the microbial load given was 40-fold above the highest human dose given in the clinical study 2.5 1010 CFU for an animal that is 117th the weight of a healthy human 4 kg vs. 70 kg and an approximately similar fraction of gastrointestinal volume.18 There was some dose-dependency on the clearance but both dose levels cleared rapidly following cessation of dosing and fell below the limit of quantification by 7 days postdos- ing.Subjects treated in the clinical study demonstrated good compliance with stool collection in an outpatient setting and the resulting data permitted the calculation of pharma- cokinetic parameters.

Following completion of dosing subjects were followed until two consecutive fecal samples were neg- ative for EcN or until at least 6 months multiple-day cohort or 12 weeks single-day cohort after the last EcN administration.This study was conducted in accordance with the Inter-national Conference on Harmonization of Technical Require- ments for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practices including collection of written informed consent from all subjects prior to study participa- tion.

The study protocol and related materials were approved by local regulatory authorities and a site-specific Ethics Committee prior to study initiation.AssessmentsTreatment compliance was assessed through patient diaries and AEs were recorded and reviewed by the investigator at each visit.

Three of three animals cleared on Day 35 for 11012 CFU of SYNB1010 compared with two of three animals for SYN975.Clinical study resultsSubject dispositionBetween September 2016 and April 2017 83 healthy adult male and female subjects were screened for study inclusion at a single site in Bulgaria including 55 subjects who were enrolled and received treatment in either the single-day n10 or multiple-day n 45 cohort Figure 2.

Previous studies with probiotic bacteria including EcN 1917 used various methodologies to detect coloniza- tion of the human intestinal tract including plating on selec- tive media and PCR detection from stool samples.21415 In one of the best examples of such a study the excretion of EcN in the stool of healthy volunteers was followed out to 48 weeks following a 7-day dosing period with EcN Mutaflor in the presence or absence of mesalamine using PCR with Nissle-specific primers.2 The authors report some subjects still being positive at 48 weeks however when evaluating the data from this study there are several limitations to the inter- pretability of the results.

A clinical study to evaluate the exposure and clearance of EcN in healthy volunteers was also performed.

In the clinical study all subjects cleared EcN following cessation of dosing with median clearance of 1 week.

Quantitative methodology can be applied to microbiome-based therapeutics and similarkinetics and clearance were observed for EcN in cynomolgus monkeys and humans.Clin Transl Sci 2018 11 200-207 doi10.1111cts.12528 published online on 1 December 2017.Study HighlightsWHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC There are little published data on methods to assess the pharmacology of microbiome-based therapeutics.WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS The studies described here were designed to 1 develop methodologies to determine the pharmacology of EcN a probiotic bacteria and engineered strains 2 evaluate the pharmacology of engineered strains in nonhuman primates and 3 quantitatively assess the pharmacology of EcN in healthy human volunteers.WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE The study demonstrates that it is feasible to assess pharmacology of bacterial therapeutics using specificPCR-based assays and quantitative pharmacology methodologies.

The current research comprised a two-part investigation first to characterize the kinetics and clear- ance for each strain in cynomolgus monkeys and second to evaluate the exposure and clearance of EcN in healthy volunteers.METHODSNonhuman primate studyA study was conducted in the cynomolgus monkey to explore tolerability and evaluate the pharmacokinetics of two EcN strains SYN975 kanamycin-resistant EcN and SYNB1010 kanamycin-resistant arginine-producing and thymidine auxotroph see Supplementary Methods Table S1 for a comparison of the genetic modifications of each bacterial strain.
