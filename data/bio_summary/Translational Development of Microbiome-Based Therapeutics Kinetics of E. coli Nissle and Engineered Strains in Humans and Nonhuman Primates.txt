quantitative methodology can be applied to microbiome-based therapeutics and similarkinetics and clearance were observed for ecn in cynomolgus monkeys and humans.clin transl sci 2018 11 200-207 doi10.1111cts.12528 published online on 1 december 2017.study highlightswhat is the current knowledge on the topic there are little published data on methods to assess the pharmacology of microbiome-based therapeutics.what question did this study address the studies described here were designed to 1 develop methodologies to determine the pharmacology of ecn a probiotic bacteria and engineered strains 2 evaluate the pharmacology of engineered strains in nonhuman primates and 3 quantitatively assess the pharmacology of ecn in healthy human volunteers.what this study adds to our knowledge the study demonstrates that it is feasible to assess pharmacology of bacterial therapeutics using specificpcr-based assays and quantitative pharmacology methodologies.

this method has a limit of detection of 20 and 40 copies of nissle dna per mg of extracted stool dna for the two primer sets 16075 and 16073 respectively.in the nonclinical study in cynomolgus monkeys 109 or1012 cfu of ecn-derived strains were very well tolerated dur- ing 28 days of treatment despite the fact that the microbial load given was 40-fold above the highest human dose given in the clinical study 2.5 1010 cfu for an animal that is 117th the weight of a healthy human 4 kg vs. 70 kg and an approximately similar fraction of gastrointestinal volume.18 there was some dose-dependency on the clearance but both dose levels cleared rapidly following cessation of dosing and fell below the limit of quantification by 7 days postdos- ing.subjects treated in the clinical study demonstrated good compliance with stool collection in an outpatient setting and the resulting data permitted the calculation of pharma- cokinetic parameters.

following completion of dosing subjects were followed until two consecutive fecal samples were neg- ative for ecn or until at least 6 months multiple-day cohort or 12 weeks single-day cohort after the last ecn administration.this study was conducted in accordance with the inter-national conference on harmonization of technical require- ments for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use good clinical practices including collection of written informed consent from all subjects prior to study participa- tion.

the study protocol and related materials were approved by local regulatory authorities and a site-specific ethics committee prior to study initiation.assessmentstreatment compliance was assessed through patient diaries and aes were recorded and reviewed by the investigator at each visit.

three of three animals cleared on day 35 for 11012 cfu of synb1010 compared with two of three animals for syn975.clinical study resultssubject dispositionbetween september 2016 and april 2017 83 healthy adult male and female subjects were screened for study inclusion at a single site in bulgaria including 55 subjects who were enrolled and received treatment in either the single-day n10 or multiple-day n 45 cohort figure 2. all subjects enrolled in the single-day cohort completed the intervention and are included in the safety and kinetics analyses.

previous studies with probiotic bacteria including ecn 1917 used various methodologies to detect coloniza- tion of the human intestinal tract including plating on selec- tive media and pcr detection from stool samples.21415 in one of the best examples of such a study the excretion of ecn in the stool of healthy volunteers was followed out to 48 weeks following a 7-day dosing period with ecn mutaflor in the presence or absence of mesalamine using pcr with nissle-specific primers.2 the authors report some subjects still being positive at 48 weeks however when evaluating the data from this study there are several limitations to the inter- pretability of the results.

microbiome profiling has demonstrated species-specific patterns.21 in addition differences have been described in host-microbiome interactions between nonhuman primates and humans including differences in adaptations to dietary changes and diversity.22 despite these observations for approaches that do not aim to change the ecology of the gut data in nonhuman primates may help identify appropriate doses by providing data regarding in vivo kinetics prior to studies in humans.limitations of the nonclinical study include variability instool output when stool samples were not available fecal swabs were taken and fewer sampling points for quantita- tive pcr during the dosing and postdosing periods and a small number of animals per group n 3. limitations of the clinical study include the outpatient treatment adminis- tration and fecal collection which may have contributed to variability in the quantitative assessments.

a clinical study to evaluate the exposure and clearance of ecn in healthy volunteers was also performed.

in the clinical study all subjects cleared ecn following cessation of dosing with median clearance of 1 week.

the current research comprised a two-part investigation first to characterize the kinetics and clear- ance for each strain in cynomolgus monkeys and second to evaluate the exposure and clearance of ecn in healthy volunteers.methodsnonhuman primate studya study was conducted in the cynomolgus monkey to explore tolerability and evaluate the pharmacokinetics of two ecn strains syn975 kanamycin-resistant ecn and synb1010 kanamycin-resistant arginine-producing and thymidine auxotroph see supplementary methods table s1 for a comparison of the genetic modifications of each bacterial strain.

no terminal necropsies were performed and animals were returned to the stock colony upon completion of the study.

fecal samples from day -5 predose days 2 21 and 28 during dosing and days 30 and 35 during washout were analyzed by quantitative pcr using ecn-specific primers.clinical studya prospective open-label single-center study was per- formed in healthy subjects who received oral doses of ecn in the form of mutaflor capsules.

the study included two cohorts a multiple-day cohort in which subjects received ecn 3 times daily with meals for 28 days and a single-day cohort in which subjects received ecn 3 times with meals in a single day.

the primary objective of the study was to evalu- ate ecn clearance in the gastrointestinal tract including the percentage of subjects with positive samples at 24 weeks after treatment initiation as well time to no detection of ecn in feces in two consecutive samples.
