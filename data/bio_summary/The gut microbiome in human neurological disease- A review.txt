in ms par- ticipants compared to blood donors have been reported.76 finally parasitic gut helminths implicated in ms risk or progression are being explored by some groups in the context of interactions with the gut micro- biota but are beyond the scope of this review.77neuromyelitis optica spectrum disordersa potential role for the gut microbiota in neuromyelitis optica nmo spectrum disorders was initially observedtremlett et al gut microbiomeindirectly through either the presence of antibodies against gi antigens78 or peripheral blood t cells cross- reactive with both aquaporin-4 and a marker found in the gut microbiota the clostridium adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter.79 however findings might not be entirely specific to nmo as gi antibodies were also found in ms subjects and healthy controls78 and most nmo patients were rituximab- exposed at the time of stool collection.7879 nonetheless further work is warranted to investigate whether findings indicate a role for gut microbiota in nmo pathogenesis or reflect a consequence of treatment.post-literature review update.

briefly mice raised in a germ-free environment were highly resistant to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae53-55 an animal model of ms unless receiving a fecal transplant from mice colonized with a gut microbiota.55 furthermore reduced disease activity lower clinical scores was observed in germ-free mice when eae was induced.5455 circumstantial evi- dence includes the overlap between many of the poten- tial risk factors for ms and the gut microbiota environmental factors associated with ms onset such as obesity56 smoking57 viruses5859 and vitamin dsun- lightseason60 can also profoundly impact the gut microbiota see fig 2 as can host genetics human leu- kocyte antigen61 and a person's age and sex.6263 an increased prevalence of leaky gut measured via an oral lactulosemannitol test was also recently suggested in a pilot study of 22 relapsing-remitting ms cases compared to controls.64annals of neurologydifferences in the gut microbiota between ms cases and healthy controlsstudies are emerging involving both adult and pediatric ms subjects supplementary table.484965-68 all includ- ed those with relapsing-remitting onset and showed dif- ferences at some level between the ms subjects' and controls' gut microbiota composition.

for example the enrichment of archaea genus methanobre- vibacter in some ms subjects was reported relative to controls65 as well as depletion of members from the fir- micutes eg clostridium genera and bacteroidetes phy- la.4966-68 although not a focus of the current review single biomarkers such as serum levels of a lipodipeptide lipid 654 thought to be derived from oral or gi bacte- ria bacteroidetes were found to be lower in primarilydisease-modifying drug-treated ms cases n 5 17 rela- tive to 12 healthy controls.73no studies were found where the functional capaci- ty of the gut microbiota in ms had been comprehensive- ly assessed although 2 explored the predicted metagenome using picrust and found significant dif- ferences between cases and controls for pathways involv- ing fatty acid metabolism lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and glycolysisglutathione metabolism.4849 individuals exposed to an ms disease-modifying drug also exhibited a predicted enrichment in pathways involved with immune responses compared to non-ms drug-exposed individuals.4849gut microbiota and ms disease activityone small cross-sectional study reported differences in the gut microbiota community composition measured as beta-diversity by proximity to a relapse samples collect- ed within 1 month of a relapse were compared to those collected at other times.48 however demographic and ms disease-modifying drug exposure differences between the two groups may have contributed to this observa- tion.48 nonetheless the concept that the microbiota might contribute to disease activity is intriguing.

however the inability to detect unique or novel microbes combined with relatively high cost and qualita- tive results based on fluorescence rather than the quanti- tative data obtained with 16s rrna sequencing results in limited usage.33following high-throughput sequencing 16s rrna sequences are clustered by sequence similarity intotremlett et al gut microbiomeoperational taxonomic units otus the most utilized unit of microbial diversity and identification is deter- mined using one of the published and freely available 16s ribosomal databases eg greengenes silva.3435 the threshold to discriminate otus is technically arbi- trary with the cutoff commonly set at 97 sequence similarity.3637 although it is a convenient and powerful technique to report the biological and ecological niche of largely unculturable gut microbes the extent to which 16s rrna clustering recapitulates the true microbial phylogeny remains debated.
