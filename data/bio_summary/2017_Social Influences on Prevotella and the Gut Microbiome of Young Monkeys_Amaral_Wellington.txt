Changes in the structure of the gut microbiome are likely to induce differences in metabolic and physiologic functioning.Key words monkey microbiome Prevotella infant weaning diversity.INTRODUCTIONecent research has highlighted the significance of the gut microbiome for promoting the health and normal develop- ment of young infants not only for digestive and immune function but also via effects of the enteric nervous system and gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the brain 1-7.

Although the non- human primate gut microbiota composition is relatively similar in compo- sition to humans the rhesus gut microbiome is not a commonly reported biosphere.

Fortunately research by other investigators who had access to gut tissue and lumenal content from monkeys already documented that the relative prevalence of the primary taxa in stool is reflective of their numbers in the distal gut 15.

Unpaired t-test comparisons of mean dissimilarity distances among gut microbiota profiles indicated that sample-to-sample distances decreased by 2 weeks in the group-living monkeys compared to when the infants had first come from different cages with just their mothers t  4.28 p  .001.
