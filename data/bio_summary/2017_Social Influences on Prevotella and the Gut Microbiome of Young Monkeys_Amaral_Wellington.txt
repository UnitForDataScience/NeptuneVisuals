functional pathway predictions further suggested that the microbiota changes associated with the social group transition would lead to a decrease in processes related to energy metabolism glycan biosynthesis metabolism of cofactors and vitamins terpenoid and polyketides and affect the regulation of host digestive and immune processestable 2. microbiota composition ranked by abundance at the genus level for study 1day 12 weeksindicates statistically significant differences prevotella t  -4.45 p  .002 blautia t  -3.02 p  .018 lactobacillus t  3.17 p  .015 ruminococcus t  3.52 p  .009 and clostridium t  2.76 p  .028 p values were fda-adjusted by benjamini-hochberg method.table 3. kegg ortholog predictions based on changes in microbiota profilesfig.

though rarefactions were not used for any analyses rarefaction curves were generated and inspected before any subsequent analyses to determine whether sampling depth was sufficiently accurate to characterize the gut microbiota.furthermore we generated the faith's whole tree index of phyloge- netic diversity as well as other common indices shannon index chao1 and observed species to examine sample richness or alpha diversity and weighted unifrac dissimilarity matrices to examine differences in microbial community structure beta diversity while accounting for both microbial abundances and phylogenetic relatedness as well as unweighted unifrac which only accounts for taxa presenceabsence 4142. these measures were generated using qiime and principal coordinates pcoa obtained through emperor 43. phylogenetic investigation of communi- ties by reconstruction of unobserved states was also used to predict mi- crobial metagenomes from kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs to assess potential shifts in the metabolic activity of the microbiota with respect to functional pathways 39. although the non- human primate gut microbiota composition is relatively similar in compo- sition to humans the rhesus gut microbiome is not a commonly reported biosphere.

unpaired t-test comparisons of mean dissimilarity distances among gut microbiota profiles indicated that sample-to-sample distances decreased by 2 weeks in the group-living monkeys compared to when the infants had first come from different cages with just their mothers t  4.28 p  .001. despite this convergence in microbial community structure there was not a net loss of richness or bacterial diversity between day 1 and 2 weeks t  0.39 p  .740. taxonomic analyses indicated shifts in bacterial composition at the genus level.

changes in the structure of the gut microbiome are likely to induce differences in metabolic and physiologic functioning.key words monkey microbiome prevotella infant weaning diversity.introductionecent research has highlighted the significance of the gut microbiome for promoting the health and normal develop- ment of young infants not only for digestive and immune function but also via effects of the enteric nervous system and gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the brain 1-7. other studies have demonstrated that the mode of delivery vaginal versus cesarean section and parental decisions regarding breast- or formula-feeding can influence the establishment the infant's gut microbiota affecting both the diversity and richness of the microbial community 4-6. in addition there seems to be another important developmental transition that coincides with weaning.

microbial convergence within a group would also be in keeping with reports of similar microbial profiles among members of the same household for farm animals in a shared pen and even microbial communities in social groups table 5. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways that were correlated with increased prevotella abundance454 pyrosequencingillumina miseq pearson correlation coefficient fdr adjusted p pearson correlation coefficient fdr adjusted pcellular processesfalse discovery rate-adjustment benjamini-hochberg method nonsignificant kegg pathways were omitted from this table.between children and their pet companion animals 57-61. cohousing and cohabitation effects on the microbiota have also been noted in other rodent and primate studies 7-9. to directly test this question our current research is determining if developing monkeys will continue to maintain stable differences in the prevalence of specific taxa which may offer protective or metabolic advantages.source of funding and conflict of interest this research was supported by grants from the nimh mh104198 and nichd hd080201.
