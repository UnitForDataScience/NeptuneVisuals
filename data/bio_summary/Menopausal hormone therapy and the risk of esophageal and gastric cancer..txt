these meta- analyses have found decreased risk estimates of esophageal adenocarcinoma odds ratio 0.75 95 ci 0.58-0.98 5 studies included12 gastric adenocarcinoma risk ratio 0.77 95 ci 0.64-0.92 7 studies included13 and esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma risk ratio 0.68 95 ci 0.48-0.96 4 studies includ- ed.14 moreover presence of estrogen receptors have repeatedly been found in both esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma cells and treatment with ligands binding to selective estrogen receptors could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma.30-37 it has also been suggested that sex hormones inhibit cell growth in gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.38-40progesterone receptors have been found in gastric adeno- carcinoma in some studies but to a similar extent as in nor- mal mucosa.3341-43 androgen receptors have been identifiedin esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma while these receptors have been inconsistently found in gastric adenocarcinoma.43-45 thus sex hormonal influence might play a key role in explaining the findings of this study.there is a need for more large-scale studies with long follow-up and adjustment for lifestyle factors before a causal relation between sex hormonal therapy and cancer prevention can be established.

original studies examining mht and risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma have typically been under-powered have mostly examined one or two cancers per study and arrived at inconsistent findings.111 however meta-analysescomparing ever-users of mht with non-users have shown statistically significantly decreased relative risk estimates of esophageal adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and also of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.12-14 we hypothe- sized that mht decreases the risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma but not of esophageal squamous cell carci- noma.

the ever-users and non-users were similar regarding the prevalence of all matching variables table 1. the median follow-up time among the users of mht was 7.0 years 2540 days and the interquartile range was 4.1-7.4 years 1487- 2685 days.risk of esophageal adenocarcinomaamong the ever-users of mht 46 0.02 developed esoph- ageal adenocarcinoma while 224 0.03 such cases occurred among non-users table 1. the adjusted or of esophageal adenocarcinoma was 38 lower among ever-users compared to non-users or 0.62 95 ci 0.45-0.85 table 2. among users of estrogen only mht the corresponding or was 0.57 95 ci 0.37-0.87 while the or among women receiving estrogen and progestin combined mht was 0.70 95 ci 0.45-1.09. in mht-users younger than 60 years the or of esophageal adenocarcinoma was particularly decreased or 0.20 95 ci 0.06-0.65 while the ors were less decreased in mht-users aged 60-70 years or 0.60 95 ci 0.34-1.07and those older than 70 years or 0.79 95 ci 0.52-1.19 table 3. the statistical power was insufficient to allow anal- yses examining duration of mht.risk of gastric adenocarcinomathere were 123 0.04 new cases of gastric adeoncarcinoma among the ever-users of mht and 608 0.07 cases among the non-users table 1. comparing ever-users with non- users the overall adjusted or of gastric adenocarcinoma was0.61 95 ci 0.50-0.74 table 2. ever-users of estrogen only mht or 0.60 95 ci 0.47-0.76 and of estrogen and progestin combined mht or 0.64 95 ci 0.48-0.87 had decreased ors of similar strength.

we did not adjust for gastroesophageal reflux disease or helico- bacter pylori the risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma respectively.17 however estro- gen therapy is rather associated with an increased risk of reflux and could therefore not explain the negative associa- tion between mht and esophageal adenocarcinoma.28 mht use is unlikely to be associated with helicobacter pylori and thus should not act as a confounder.29 a weakness was the lack of starting dates of mht use for women enrolled in the cohort in july 2005 start of the study which prohibited an assessment of duration of mht use in relation to cancer risk.

if the findings of the current study are supported by such research they would encourage research examining new prevention strategies using sex hormonal therapy in high-risk individuals of esophageal or gastric can- cers and of hormonal adjuvant therapy of these tumors.in conclusion this large population-based cohort study with robust assessments of exposures and outcomes and adjustment for several potential confounding factors found that ever-users of mht are at a decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

tel 146-8-517-709-40 fax146-8-517-762-80 e-mail the explanation for the intriguing male predominance in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma might provide impor- tant clues to the etiology of these tumors and also pave the way for research examining novel preventive and therapeutic medication.1 the up to 9-fold higher risk of esophageal ade- nocarcinoma among men than in women is not explained by the sex distribution of its main risk factors i.e.

the estrogen only mht-users had a decreased risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma in particular while women using combinedtherapy with estrogen and progestin may be at a particularly decreased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

the overall adjusted or of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was 43 decreased among ever-users or 0.57 95 ci 0.39-0.83 table 2. the or among women receiving estrogen only mht was 0.71 95 ci 0.46-1.09 and 0.38 95 ci 0.19-0.75 amongwomen receiving estrogen and progestin combined table 2. the or was 0.80 95 ci 0.26-2.44 in mht-users younger than 60 years 0.41 95 ci 0.20-0.82 in users aged 60-70 years and 0.65 95 ci 0.40-1.05 in mht-users older than70 years table 3. comparing duration 12 months with12 months of mht treatment rendered an incidence rate ratio of 0.45 95 ci 0.11-1.79.discussionin this study ever-users of mht were at a decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

fre- quency matching was used aiming for a 13 ratio with exact matching on three binary variables parity ever-parous or non-parous increased life time exposure to estrogen hyster- ectomy leading to earlier contact with gynecologist and influencing the choice of what mht treatment to use and thrombotic events contraindication for mht.26 nearest neighbor matching was done for another five variables age a risk factor for cancer determined from exact date of birth diabetes mellitus a proxy for obesity obesity which might influence the probability of receiving mht and is a risk fac- tor for the studies cancers smoking-related diseases a proxy for smoking which might influence both the probability of receiving mht and the cancer risk and alcohol-related dis- eases a proxy for high alcohol consumption which might influence both the probability of receiving mht and the can- cer risk.26 the used matching method aims for as close to an exact match on all the included variables to reduce base- line imbalances.

for esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma a strongly decreased risk following mht use was found among younger women.strengths of this study include the complete nationwide coverage with a large sample size the completeness of the follow-up and the validity of the data contained in the swed- ish registers used.

the lack of any increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with longer duration of mht argues in favor of non-hormonal influence.
