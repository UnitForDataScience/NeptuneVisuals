These meta- analyses have found decreased risk estimates of esophageal adenocarcinoma odds ratio 0.75 95 CI 0.58-0.98 5 studies included12 gastric adenocarcinoma risk ratio 0.77 95 CI 0.64-0.92 7 studies included13 and esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma risk ratio 0.68 95 CI 0.48-0.96 4 studies includ- ed.14 Moreover presence of estrogen receptors have repeatedly been found in both esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma cells and treatment with ligands binding to selective estrogen receptors could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma.30-37 It has also been suggested that sex hormones inhibit cell growth in gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.38-40Progesterone receptors have been found in gastric adeno- carcinoma in some studies but to a similar extent as in nor- mal mucosa.3341-43 Androgen receptors have been identifiedin esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma while these receptors have been inconsistently found in gastric adenocarcinoma.43-45 Thus sex hormonal influence might play a key role in explaining the findings of this study.There is a need for more large-scale studies with long follow-up and adjustment for lifestyle factors before a causal relation between sex hormonal therapy and cancer prevention can be established.

Original studies examining MHT and risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma have typically been under-powered have mostly examined one or two cancers per study and arrived at inconsistent findings.111 However meta-analysescomparing ever-users of MHT with non-users have shown statistically significantly decreased relative risk estimates of esophageal adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and also of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.12-14 We hypothe- sized that MHT decreases the risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma but not of esophageal squamous cell carci- noma.

We did not adjust for gastroesophageal reflux disease or Helico- bacter pylori the risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma respectively.17 However estro- gen therapy is rather associated with an increased risk of reflux and could therefore not explain the negative associa- tion between MHT and esophageal adenocarcinoma.28 MHT use is unlikely to be associated with Helicobacter pylori and thus should not act as a confounder.29 A weakness was the lack of starting dates of MHT use for women enrolled in the cohort in July 2005 start of the study which prohibited an assessment of duration of MHT use in relation to cancer risk.

If the findings of the current study are supported by such research they would encourage research examining new prevention strategies using sex hormonal therapy in high-risk individuals of esophageal or gastric can- cers and of hormonal adjuvant therapy of these tumors.In conclusion this large population-based cohort study with robust assessments of exposures and outcomes and adjustment for several potential confounding factors found that ever-users of MHT are at a decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

fre- quency matching was used aiming for a 13 ratio with exact matching on three binary variables parity ever-parous or non-parous increased life time exposure to estrogen hyster- ectomy leading to earlier contact with gynecologist and influencing the choice of what MHT treatment to use and thrombotic events contraindication for MHT.26 Nearest neighbor matching was done for another five variables age a risk factor for cancer determined from exact date of birth diabetes mellitus a proxy for obesity obesity which might influence the probability of receiving MHT and is a risk fac- tor for the studies cancers smoking-related diseases a proxy for smoking which might influence both the probability of receiving MHT and the cancer risk and alcohol-related dis- eases a proxy for high alcohol consumption which might influence both the probability of receiving MHT and the can- cer risk.26 The used matching method aims for as close to an exact match on all the included variables to reduce base- line imbalances.

The estrogen only MHT-users had a decreased risk of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma in particular while women using combinedtherapy with estrogen and progestin may be at a particularly decreased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Comparing duration 12 months with12 months of MHT treatment rendered an incidence rate ratio of 0.45 95 CI 0.11-1.79.DiscussionIn this study ever-users of MHT were at a decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

For esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma a strongly decreased risk following MHT use was found among younger women.Strengths of this study include the complete nationwide coverage with a large sample size the completeness of the follow-up and the validity of the data contained in the Swed- ish registers used.
