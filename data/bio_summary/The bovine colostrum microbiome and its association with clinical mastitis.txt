Of the 6 most common phyla detected in both parities the mean rela- tive abundance MRA of the Firmicutes phylum was higher P  0.05 in samples of primiparous MRA  46.1 SE  1.8 than in multiparous cows MRA  40.8 SE  1.6 and the Fusobacteria phylum were lower P  0.05 in samples of primiparous MRA  2.8 SE  0.6 than in multiparous cows MRA  4.8 SE  0.5 Figure 2B.The 15 most common OTU order family and ge-nus detected in colostrum samples of primiparous and multiparous cows are shown in Figure 3A and more detailed findings at the quarter level are presented in Figure 3B to E. Genus Bacteroides MRA  1.1 and 2.5 SE  0.4 and 0.3 for primiparous and multipa- rous respectively P  0.05 gAcinetobacter MRA 2.3 and 3.5 SE  0.5 and 0.4 for primiparous and multiparous respectively P  0.05 gPseudo- monas MRA  3.5 and 4.8 SE  0.5 and 0.4 forprimiparous and multiparous respectively P  0.05 and gFusobacterium MRA  2.8 and 5.0 SE  0.6 and 0.5 for primiparous and multiparous respectively P  0.08 were either significantly higher or tended to be significantly higher in colostrum samples of mul- tiparous cows than in primiparous cows Figure 3A.

The microbial community of NCMC samples of primiparous cows was significantly more diverse than that of CMC samples and the rela- tive abundances of the Tenericutes and Fusobacteria phyla as well as the Mycoplasma and Fusobacterium genera were significantly higher in NCMC than in CMC samples of primiparous cows.

Ge- nus Staphylococcus gPseudomonas gFusobacterium gMycoplasma gCorynebacterium gStreptococcus and gEscherichia were subjected to more detailed analyses Figure 5A and B. Genus Fusobacterium and gMycoplasma were relatively more abundant P 0.05 in CMC than in NCMC samples of primipa-rous cows Figure 5A and gStreptococcus tended to be more abundant in CMC than in NCMC samples of multiparous cows Figure 5B.The colostrum core microbiome defined as the set of microbial organisms persistently present in all samples evaluated regardless of parity or colostrum category was assessed.
