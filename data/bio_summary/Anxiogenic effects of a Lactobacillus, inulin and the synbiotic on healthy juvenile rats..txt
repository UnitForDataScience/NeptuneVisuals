A similar treatment effect is observed in CA1 F313 7.472 p  0.01 where L. casei 54-2-33 treatment has a lower expression of 5-HT1A protein than control rats p  0.01 while synbiotic-fed rats have significantly higher levels of 5-HT1A protein than L. casei 54-2-33 rats p  0.05 C. There is no statistically significant overall effect of treatments in the CA3 layer F313  3.355 p  0.0522 D.However Tukey's comparison test reveals that L. casei 54-2-33-fed rats have significantly lower levels of 5-HT1A protein than control animals p  0.05 D.DISCUSSIONThe effect of administration of L. casei 54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic mixture of both in healthy young rats and the impact of this change behaviors and brain parameters were analyzed.

The values in A are plasma corticosterone concentration at the end of treatment in nai ve rats control n  6 L. casei 54-2-33 n  5 inulin n  5 synbiotic n  7 whereas B shows hormone levels evoked 30 min after subjecting animals to the elevated plus maze test control n  9 L. casei 54-2-33 n  9 inulin n  9 synbiotic n  9.   p  0.0001 when compared to controlp  0.001 when compared to control p  0.0001 when compared to L. casei 54-2-33 p  0.001 when compared to L. casei 54-2-33 p  0.001 when compared to inulin.Fig.

All of this evi- dence suggests that changes in behavior obtained afteradministration L. casei 54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic in juvenile animals may be age-dependent and also that the effects on the CNS are specific depending on the type of bacteria prebiotic and the mixture of both.In relation to the latter another contributing factor to the behavioral differences observed between OF and EPM tests could be the nature of the treatments as L. casei L-54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic promote specific effects on behavior corticosterone secretion basal and EPM-evoked levels of the hormone and changes in hippocampal 5-HT1A mRNA expression.

Control n  9 L. casei 54-2-33 n  9 Inulin n  9 Synbiotic n  9.cornus ammonis 1 layer CA1 F313  4.484 p  0.05 where synbiotic treatment has a higher expression of 5-HT1A mRNA than control and inulin groups p  0.01 C. Nevertheless in hippocampal CA3 region no overall or individual effect was found D.Hippocampal expression of 5-HT1A receptorImmunohistochemistry was used to determine hippocampal 5-HT1A protein levels in the same mentioned areas Sup DG Inf DG CA3 and CA1.

Post-test shows that synbiotic-fed rats have lower plasmatic levels of CORT evoked by EPM test in comparison to L. casei 54-2-33 inulin and control rats p  0.01 control vs. synbiotic p  0.001 L. casei 54-2- 33 vs. synbiotic p  0.01 inulin vs. synbiotic.Behavioral testsAt 13 days of treatment results indicate that there is an effect in the number of entries to the central area CA F332  9415 p  0.001.

In addition EPM-evoked levels of corticosterone in L. casei 54-2-33 and inulin-fed rats are similar to control which suggest that HPA axis regulation has reached a maximum ceiling effect that is not further affected by either L. casei 54-2-33 or inulin.

Control n  9 L. casei 54-2-33 n  9 Inulin n  9 Synbiotic n  9.interventions do not affect weight gain in juvenile rats but it does alter basal plasma corticosterone concentration being the administration of L. casei 54-2-33 and inulin significantly effective in elevating plasma concentration of this hormone when compared to control-fed rats.

Therefore in animals fed with L. casei L-54-2-33 and inulin which had higher levels of basal plasma corticosterone in comparison to control-fed rats lower levels of transcript to 5-HT1A were expected.

It is interesting that most studies have focused largely on the early events that increase vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disor- ders therefore the present results suggest that achieving a complete sense of the pathophysiology of anxiety not only requires an understanding of the molecules involved within the CNS but also of the various stimuli that lead to alterations in genes like 5-HT1A including alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota during early stages of development.CONCLUSIONTreating rats with L. casei 54-2-33 inulin or synbiotic during their juvenile life affects plasma levels of corticosterone induces changes in anxiety-like behaviors and changes in brain gene expression.

There is also a significant difference between synbiotic-treated animals and L. casei 54-2-33-fed rats at CA1   p  0.05 C. There is no effect of treatments on the CA3 region D. control n  6 L. casei 54-2-33 n  5 inulin n  5 synbiotic n  5.
