results show that in sup dg there is an overall effect of interventions on young rats f313  5.325 p  0.05. post-test shows significantly lower levels of 5-ht1a protein in l. casei 54-2-33-fed animals compared to control group p  0.05 a. in inf dg there is also a treatment effect f313  4.147 p  0.05 and post-test indicates that 5-ht1a protein levels aresignificantly lower than control rats p  0.05 b. a similar treatment effect is observed in ca1 f313 7.472 p  0.01 where l. casei 54-2-33 treatment has a lower expression of 5-ht1a protein than control rats p  0.01 while synbiotic-fed rats have significantly higher levels of 5-ht1a protein than l. casei 54-2-33 rats p  0.05 c. there is no statistically significant overall effect of treatments in the ca3 layer f313  3.355 p  0.0522 d.however tukey's comparison test reveals that l. casei 54-2-33-fed rats have significantly lower levels of 5-ht1a protein than control animals p  0.05 d.discussionthe effect of administration of l. casei 54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic mixture of both in healthy young rats and the impact of this change behaviors and brain parameters were analyzed.

in rats exposed to behavioral studies b there is also an effect of experimental interventions f323  9.279 p  0.001. post-test shows that synbiotic-fed rats have lower plasmatic levels of cort evoked by epm test in comparison to l. casei 54-2-33 inulin and control rats p  0.01 control vs. synbiotic p  0.001 l. casei 54-2- 33 vs. synbiotic p  0.01 inulin vs. synbiotic.behavioral testsat 13 days of treatment results indicate that there is an effect in the number of entries to the central area ca f332  9415 p  0.001. post-test indicates significantly less entries to the ca for all treatments compared to control p  0.001 control vs. l. casei 54- 2-33 p  0.01 control vs. inulin p  0.01 control vs. synbiotic a. moreover the analysis of variance for time spent in ca shows that there is an effect of treatments f332  10.46 p  0.001 while post-test also showed significantly lower times for all treatment groups when compared to controls p  0.001 control vs. l. casei 54-2-33 p  0.001 control vs. inulin p  0.001 control vs. synbiotic b.in the epm test entries to closed arms open arms and total time spent in them were analyzed.

results show that in the suprapyramidal layer of the dentate gyrus sup dg there is an overall effect of interventions on young rats f313  4.440 p  0.05. moreover post-test shows significantly higher levels of 5-ht1a mrna expression in synbiotic-fed animals compared to control and inulin groups p  0.01 a. in the infrapyramidal layer of the dentate gyrus inf dg there is also a treatment effect f313  3.817 p  0.05 and post-test indicates that 5-ht1a mrna expression is significantly higher than synbiotic and control groups p  0.05 b. a similar treatment effect is observed infig.

tukey's comparison test reveals that l. casei 54-2-33 and inulin-fed rats have significantly higher levels of plasma corticosterone cort than control-fed rats p  0.001. in addition plasma cort levels of synbiotic-fed rats were no different than control animals although they were significantly lower than plasma levels of l. casei 54-2- 33 and inulin-fed rats p  0.01 in both cases.

all of this evi- dence suggests that changes in behavior obtained afteradministration l. casei 54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic in juvenile animals may be age-dependent and also that the effects on the cns are specific depending on the type of bacteria prebiotic and the mixture of both.in relation to the latter another contributing factor to the behavioral differences observed between of and epm tests could be the nature of the treatments as l. casei l-54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic promote specific effects on behavior corticosterone secretion basal and epm-evoked levels of the hormone and changes in hippocampal 5-ht1a mrna expression.

control n  9 l. casei 54-2-33 n  9 inulin n  9 synbiotic n  9.interventions do not affect weight gain in juvenile rats but it does alter basal plasma corticosterone concentration being the administration of l. casei 54-2-33 and inulin significantly effective in elevating plasma concentration of this hormone when compared to control-fed rats.

in addition epm-evoked levels of corticosterone in l. casei 54-2-33 and inulin-fed rats are similar to control which suggest that hpa axis regulation has reached a maximum ceiling effect that is not further affected by either l. casei 54-2-33 or inulin.

number of entries a and time spent in open arms c show a significant difference between synbiotic and inulin treatment which shows an increase in both cases   p  0.01 when compared with inulin   p  0.001 when compared to inulin.

synbiotic treatment shows an increase in 5-ht1a mrna expression compared to control and inulin group a   p  0.05 when compared to control   p  0.05 when compared to inulin.

statistical significance was set at p  0.05.resultsbody weight and water intakerepeated measures anova shows that l. casei 54-2-33 inulin and synbiotic-treated animals had similar weight gains to control animals within the 14 days of dietary intervention a with no different statistical significance between groups f1.0557.385  1.154 p  0.3208. in addition following an anova withfig.

however the number of entries into the open arms of synbiotic-fed rats is significantly higher when compared to inulin treatment p  0.01 a. on the other hand there are no significant differences in l. casei 54-2-33 and inulin treatments when compared to control group.

there is also a significant difference between synbiotic-treated animals and l. casei 54-2-33-fed rats at ca1   p  0.05 c. there is no effect of treatments on the ca3 region d. control n  6 l. casei 54-2-33 n  5 inulin n  5 synbiotic n  5. panels e to h are representative microphotographs of each condition.
