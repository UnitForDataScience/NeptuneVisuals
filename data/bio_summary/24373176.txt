2d.When post hoc analyses were performed to compare the expression levels of CD11b and HLA-DR on PMNs from AS subgroups based on disease pattern axial-AS patients with AS disease confined to the axial skeleton and peripheral-AS patients with AS disease with peripheral involvement no significant differences regarding CD11b or HLA-DR expressions on PMNs were found.DISCUSSIONAS is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton resulting in inflammatory back pain and morning stiffness.1213 Its prevalence is 0.5 in the general population14 and it is more com- mon among Caucasians and HLA-B27-positive young men.1215 Its etiology has not been fully understood and several factors such as genetic susceptibly infec- tions and disorders of the immune system may be involved.1617 The disease is not confined to the muscu- loskeletal system some patients experience extra-articu- lar manifestations such as uveitis and intestinal inflammation indicating the systemic nature of AS.18 Subclinical intestinal inflammation is observed in up to 73 of AS patients.19 The occurrence of microscopic gut inflammation is associated with higher disease activity.20The immunological changes in AS intestinal inflam- mation are similar to those reported in Crohn's disease CD one of the IBD.21-27 Moreover AS patients also present with serologic markers of IBD including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies anti-Saccharomy- ces cerevisiae antibodies anti- CBir1 anti-I2 and anti- OmpC.28-31 Both diseases also show higher intestinal permeability in the 31Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resorption test.32In the intestinal microbiota there are components such as LPS a molecular pattern of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall.

CD11b expression was assessed in the following AS subgroups based on the medications in use i AS NSAID patients using only NSAIDs without anti-TNF agents ii AS anti-TNF patients using anti-TNF agents with or without concomitant use of NSAIDs iii AS none patients with recent diagnosis and using no medication.

We conducted an experimental study to determine if AS patients exhibit an enhanced inflammatory response to microbial compounds.Method We incubated whole peripheral blood of AS patients and healthy controls with phosphate-buffered saline PBS or lipopolysaccharide LPS for 48 h with saturating levels of labeled antibodies CD66b CD11b and human leukocyte antigen type DR HLA-DR for flow cytometry.

However significantly lower levels of CD11b and HLA-DR were observed in PMNs from AS patients than HC in response to incubation with PBS for 48 h.Conclusion We concluded that the response of AS innate immune cells to LPS is similar to that observed in immune cells from HCs and suggested that the lower PMN activation of AS patients after 48 h saline incubation is mainly due to anti-inflammatory medication.Key words ankylosing spondylitis CD11b antigens inflammation lipopolysaccharides microbiota poly- morphonuclear leukocytes.INTRODUCTIONAnkylosing spondylitis AS is a chronic condition that causes pain along the spine due to inflammation of the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments in vertebrae and progressive limitation of mobility due to ossification ofCorrespondence Professor Fabricio Souza Neves MD PhD Departamento de Clinica Medica - Hospital Universitario da UFSC 3o andar - Campus Universitario Trindade Flori- anopolis SC.

In fact a growing body of evidence sug- gests that an increased responsiveness of the innate immune system is responsible for chronic inflamma- tion in patients with AS.2Up to two-thirds of patients with AS present with microscopic signs of gastrointestinal ulcerations but no clinical manifestations.3 In addition inflammatory bowel diseases IBD may present with musculoskeletal inflammation similar to AS.1 It is believed that intesti- nal microbiota plays an important role in theemergence of AS since transgenic rats animal models of AS when raised in germ-free conditions do not develop the disease symptoms that appear when these animals are raised under normal conditions.4 Thus one hypothesis regarding disease pathogenesis is that mole- cules of bacterial origin pass from the intestinal lumen to the internal environment leading to chronic oversti- mulation of the innate immune system.Lipopolysaccharide LPS is a glycolipid that consti- tutes the major portion of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

2a.CD11b expression was also assessed in the following AS subgroups defined according to disease activity i AS low disease activity patients with BASDAI  4 andAS high disease activity patients with BASDAI  4.

However our comparison between LPS- stimulated responses in patients using medication and patients without medication showed no significant difference.

Capsoni et al.36 also demonstrated that anti-TNF use did not affect CD11b levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Nevertheless after 48 h incubation with PBS the expression levels of both HLA-DR and CD11b on PMNs from AS patients were significantly lower than those observed on PMNs from HCs.
