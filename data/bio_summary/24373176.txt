however when the cells were incubated with 48-h-pbs cd11b expression on as pmns was signi- ficantly lower than on hc pmns t  5.05 p  0.001.this finding prompted post hoc analyses that are pre- sented in figure 2. cd11b expression was assessed in the following as subgroups based on the medications in use i as nsaid patients using only nsaids without anti-tnf agents ii as anti-tnf patients using anti-tnf agents with or without concomitant use of nsaids iii as none patients with recent diagnosis and using no medication.

2d.when post hoc analyses were performed to compare the expression levels of cd11b and hla-dr on pmns from as subgroups based on disease pattern axial-as patients with as disease confined to the axial skeleton and peripheral-as patients with as disease with peripheral involvement no significant differences regarding cd11b or hla-dr expressions on pmns were found.discussionas is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton resulting in inflammatory back pain and morning stiffness.1213 its prevalence is 0.5 in the general population14 and it is more com- mon among caucasians and hla-b27-positive young men.1215 its etiology has not been fully understood and several factors such as genetic susceptibly infec- tions and disorders of the immune system may be involved.1617 the disease is not confined to the muscu- loskeletal system some patients experience extra-articu- lar manifestations such as uveitis and intestinal inflammation indicating the systemic nature of as.18 subclinical intestinal inflammation is observed in up to 73 of as patients.19 the occurrence of microscopic gut inflammation is associated with higher disease activity.20the immunological changes in as intestinal inflam- mation are similar to those reported in crohn's disease cd one of the ibd.21-27 moreover as patients also present with serologic markers of ibd including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies anti-saccharomy- ces cerevisiae antibodies anti- cbir1 anti-i2 and anti- ompc.28-31 both diseases also show higher intestinal permeability in the 31cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resorption test.32in the intestinal microbiota there are components such as lps a molecular pattern of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall.

capsoni et al.36 also demonstrated that anti-tnf use did not affect cd11b levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.nevertheless after 48 h incubation with pbs the expression levels of both hla-dr and cd11b on pmns from as patients were significantly lower than those observed on pmns from hcs.

lps binds to soluble or membrane- bound cd14 which facilitates its interaction with the complex toll-like receptor tlr-4 and myeloid differ- entiation factor md-2 which is able to initialize cellu- lar signals that lead to cell activation.5polymorphonuclear neutrophils pmns are primar- ily responsible for the innate immune response acting as the primary effectors by rapidly migrating into target tissues and initiating potent mechanisms such as phagocytosis production of reactive oxygen species and release of prostaglandins and antimicrobial sub- stances.6 the importance of pmns in the inflammatory process of vertebral facet joints in as has already been demonstrated.7 the migration of pmns plays a central role in inflammatory responses because pmns must leave the bloodstream and cross the endothelium to reach the target tissue.

we also measured basal cd11b and hla-dr levels on circulating pmn without incubation.results we found that cd11b and hla-dr levels were similarly elevated in response to lps on pmns from healthy controls hc and as patients.

however significantly lower levels of cd11b and hla-dr were observed in pmns from as patients than hc in response to incubation with pbs for 48 h.conclusion we concluded that the response of as innate immune cells to lps is similar to that observed in immune cells from hcs and suggested that the lower pmn activation of as patients after 48 h saline incubation is mainly due to anti-inflammatory medication.key words ankylosing spondylitis cd11b antigens inflammation lipopolysaccharides microbiota poly- morphonuclear leukocytes.introductionankylosing spondylitis as is a chronic condition that causes pain along the spine due to inflammation of the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments in vertebrae and progressive limitation of mobility due to ossification ofcorrespondence professor fabricio souza neves md phd departamento de clinica medica - hospital universitario da ufsc 3o andar - campus universitario trindade flori- anopolis sc.

after specific stimuli some propor- tion of pmns synthetize and express mhc class ii con- tributing to the recognition of antigens.9our hypothesis is that pmns from as patients express excessive amounts of adhesion molecule cd11b when exposed to lps and this could lead to excessive pmn influx in target tissues.

some inflammatory diseases are associated with high levels of cd11b on peripheral pmns.35 neverthe- less our results in as did not show higher levels of cd11b compared to controls considering whole blood measures without incubation.the fact that some patients in our study were using nsaids andor anti-tnf agents may have affected the results.

thus in our study we measured the membrane expression of cd11b on pmns from patients with as incubated with lps or saline in an ex vivo whole blood model.

moreover basal levels of cd11b and hla-dr on circulating pmns were also measured as a comparison.methodsfourteen patients with as fulfilling the modified new york diagnostic criteria10 from the outpatient rheuma- tology unit of the hospital of federal university of santa catarina ufsc brazil were included in this study.

we used the mean fluorescence intensity mfi to assess the levels of cd11b and hla-dr expression on pmns.
