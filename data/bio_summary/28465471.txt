Therefore AKG supplementation may lower mouse body weight through its effects on the intestinal microbiota.AKG affected intestinal innate immunity through intestinal microbiotaWe analyzed the expression of intestinal pro- inflammatory cytokines e.g.

Interestingly AKG supplementation inhibits the expression of Crp1 and Crp5 in the ileum of antibiotic-treated mice suggesting that intestinal microbiota may mediate the influence of AKG supplementation on the expression of a-defensins.In conclusion dietary AKG supplementation lowers body weight influences intestinal microbiota and actives intestinal immunity but fails to increase the body weight and active intestinal immunity in antibiotic-treated mice.

However the influence of AKG on the intestinal innate immune system and intestinal microbiota is unknown.

This study explores the effect of oral AKG administration in drinking water 10 gL on intestinal innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in a mouse model.

We concluded that AKG might affect body weight and intestinal innate immunity through influencing intestinal microbiota.INTRODUCTIONAlpha-ketoglutarate AKG is a keto acid synthesized by deamination of glutamate Glu and an important intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

AKG supplementation increases protein levels the ratio of villus height to crypt depth and the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in intestinal mucosa but decreases intestinal 70 kilodalton heat shock protein expression in LPS-challenged pigs 9.

Recent compelling investigations have shown that glutamine Gln and arginine Arg which can convert to AKG indirectly regulate intestinal innate immunity by activating multiple signaling pathways and modulating the intestinal microbiota in a mouse model 10 11.

However the role of AKG in intestinal innate immunity and its effect on the intestinal microbiota remain unclear.

Knowledge of the influence of AKG on intestinal microbiota and intestinal immunity is critical to enhancing our understanding of the crosstalk among nutrition immunity and the microbiota.
