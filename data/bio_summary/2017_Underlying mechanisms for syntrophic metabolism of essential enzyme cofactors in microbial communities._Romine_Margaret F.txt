The genetic basis for this salvage has been defined in many organisms revealing a great diversity of transporters  alternative enzymes and pathways for converting precursors to cofactors and the tight regulation of precursor salvage and cofactor biosynthesis Correspondence WC Nelson Pacific Northwest National Labora- tory 902 Battelle Boulevard PO Box 999 MSIN J4-18 Richland WA 99352 USA.E-mail Received 31 May 2016 revised 11 November 2016 accepted19 December 2016 published online 10 February 2017 .

Thiamine transporters include the Omr1 TonB-dependent receptor the PnuT ATP-dependent transporter the ThiBPQ ABC-type transporter The YkoCDE ECF-type transporter and the ThiV2 sodium-dependent transporter.

Therefore biosynthesis of cobalamin des- tined for export has reasonable potential to be achievable.Metabolic reconstruction of cofactor biosynthesis and salvage pathways predicted the presence of precursor transporters importers that we were unable to identify.

Metagenomic sequence was derived from two unicyanobacterial consortia UCC-A and UCC-O assembled and binned into 19-member sequences Because the two consortia were nearly identical in taxonomic composition 16 heterotrophs were common to both consortia co-assembly of sequencing reads lead to near-complete assembly of nearly all members of the consortia the abundance of a 20th Alphaproteobacterial member was too low to produce sufficient genomic coverage to be included in this study.

Most members of this transporter family are implicated in export functions supportingAdenylylcobamide ProducersAdenosylcobinamide ProducersCobalamin precursor consumersFigure 3 Model of potential cobalamin precursor exchange among UCC community members.

However HL-111 can grow in defined medium lacking thiamine Supplementary Figure S7 which suggests that an alternative iminoglycine biosynthesis path- way exists and that all three organisms are also prototrophs.Two main salvage strategies are used by our consortia to produce TPP 5.

Diver- sification and specialization of precursor salvage provides a mechanism for division of labor in microbial communities and a selective advantage for partners uniquely suited for optimal syntrophic biosynthesis of cofactors see .

In summary each community is composed of a single cyanobacterium belonging to the Oscillatoriales order two Bacteroidetes five Gammaproteobacteria and  10 Alphaproteobacteria see Supplementary Table S1.Exchange of cofactor precursors is necessary to support essential metabolic processesWe used a subsystems-based genomic reconstruction approach to infer biosynthesis recycling and salvage pathways for eight B vitamin-related enzyme cofac- tors in the 19 members of UCC-A and UCC-O.

Six of the community members have salvage systems for HMP and HET with four members restricted to salvage of these precursors rather than thiamine itself and Supplementary Data 3.

Here we focused instead on two nearly identical consortia derived from benthic microbial mats that occur in a heliothermal saline epsomite MgSO4 lake in northern Washington State These unicyanobacterial consortia UCC consist of a single but distinct cyanobacterium Phormidesmis priestleyi ANA in UCC-A versus Phormidium sp.
