Finally some protocols include the use of loperamide just prior to FMT to promote microbiota transplant retention.37 In the evening or morning of FMT delivery via nasogastric tube a proton pump inhibitor is given to the recipient.63Route of deliveryVarious routes through the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract have been described including nasogastric tubes colonoscopy and enemas.55 The particular route of administration does not appear to affect the efficacy of FMT.

This article will provide an overview of C. difficile infection along with review of the rationale methods and complications of FMT including the current experience of FMT in children.c 2017 The British Infection Association.

The first clinical use of FMT in humansoccurred in fourth century China by a physician with its first effective use in a patient with a disease consistent with severe colitis.47 FMT is a technique that dated back to the seventeenth century.

Controls and patients with initial CDI have a predominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla compared to patients with rCDI who had reduced species richness.48Successful uptake of donor microbiota into recipients following FMT has been demonstrated in studies.4950 In addition to restoring intestinal dysbiosis attractive features of FMT are the high cure rates based on multiple adult studies4651 and potentially lower cost compared to other therapies.

Some believe that the cost of FMT including donor screening is likely below that of repeated antimicrobials and hospitalization.52 FMT averts further antibiotics and perpetuation of intestinal microbiome imbalance.

There is also less risk of drug allergy and potential development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.Experience of FMT in the pediatric populationWhile FMT data in adults have flourished studies in children have been scant and no controlled trials have been published.

Given that FMT is becoming more widespread in adults there has been emergence of stool banks and attempts to standardize donor material preparation and cost-effective donor screening.3762 A FMT workgroup in 2011 set out guidelines for the methodology of FMT.63Donor screening and testingPediatric reports and case series have mainly involved fecal donation from a family or household member.

Overall no infectious complications or death occurred as a result of FMT.60 15 1280 of the patients had any side effect within 12 weeks of FMT with3 that were unrelated to FMT.

Given the association of CDI and IBD further studies of FMT on the pediatric IBD population can provide insights into the role of FMT in rCDI and IBD exacerbation.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesGuerrant RL Hughes JM Lima NL Crane J.
