as a result we desire a robust parameter estimation method which means the method provides reliable and accurate parameter estimates  and under this definition a lack of robustness may stem from three different sources corrupted data the numerical integration scheme or from the numerical optimization method .next we note the methods traditionally used to solve the parameter estimation problem discuss the limitations of these methods and pre- sent alternatives.single shooting methodstypically single shooting methods are utilized to solve for biological systems .

we hope this overview may guide the interested reader towards state of the art parameter estimation methods within and beyond biological dyna- mical systems identification.multiple shooting methods  divide the relevant time intervalmethods by reformulating the problem as a constrained optimiza-another class of methods known as dynamic flux estimation and incremental parameter estimation have shown robust recovery of parameter estimates .

a vectorized spline s defined bya cp y is required to obtain a meaningful solution and prevents  s1... sn with sj  s3a b for j  1 ... n is then uniquely de-dtermined by a parameter vectorq1  qnstate variable y by s discretizing the integral of the l -norm and normalizing finally leads to the optimization problemmin j p q  wmt st q - d 2imation of the 1-norm on the interaction matrix parameters as our regularization.various methods have been proposed to include regularization andestimate the regularization parameters  and we choose to use k-fold cross-validation which is a standard method in statistics to l  nls't q - ft st q p 2get reliable regularization parameters .

optimization problem may include nonlinear spline parameters q and nonlinear regularization on the parameters p though so con- vergence in a single iteration is not always guaranteed.gauss-newton type methods are generally also local optimization methods so we empirically sample the parameter space and in- dependently repeat the optimization process with various initial guesses to obtain a global minimum.

in a phase plot of the solutions for states 1 through 4 indicates the system displayed chaotic dynamics and it is inherently difficult for parameter estimation methods to find parameters of chaotic systems.we then used the numerical solution to generate three sets of data with different levels of multiplicative noise study 1 0 noise study 2 up to 10 noise study 3 up to 25 noise and applied our parameter estimation method using each data set.

both methods are well established and optimized for metabolic pathway systems and provide robust parameter estimates by avoiding any finite difference scheme.collocation methods are finite element methods that take the ap-proach of approximating the solution to the differential equation using sufficiently smooth parametrized functions for instance cubic splines .

third it is difficult if not im- possible to directly measure environmental parameters such as nu- trient concentrations that may impact the microbiota.these features of the data derived from the human-associated mi- crobiota lead to an ill-posed parameter estimation problem since mul- tiple parameter sets may be consistent with the data.

let y be the time dependent state variable for the dynamics of n species with time variable t. then the lotka-volterra system can be written asy fy diagyb ay.1extensions that allow more complex interaction modalities can also be addressed by the computational parameter estimation frame- work described below.the number of parameters of the lotka-volterra model is propor- tional to the square of the number of interacting partners complicating the parameter estimation problem for complex datasets especially when the number of samples is limited.

the images display the cumulative local sensitivities for every optimal model parameter and initial condition for all three replicate experiments.the details of the analysis used to select this subject can be found in .as shown in  the results of the parameter estimation led to spline solutions that closely approximated the state solutions found using the optimal model parameters.

notorious parameter estimation examples illustrating the lack of robustness can be found in  and various alternative methods have been de- veloped to compensate for such lack of robustness.alternative methodshere we give a short overview of some of these alternative methods.

while this overview is not comprehensive the vast volume of pub- lications on parameter estimation methods illustrates the exigency of these methods and that this is a field of active research .

the code provided in parameters to their true values and the absolute errors in the optimal model parameters suggested the true model parameters and the system dynamics were recovered very well in all three studies.by plotting the relative error between the spline solutions and the state solutions in  all three studies additionally illustrated that the optimal spline functions also proved to be a good approximation of the state solutions found using the optimal model parameters.as an unknown sparsity pattern was an assumption in our model for these simulation studies our method's ability to capture the true sparsity pattern was relevant.

for single shooting methods first initial guesses for p0 and y0 are used to numerically solve the initial value problem forward problem using single- or multi-step methods such as runge-kutta and adams-bashforth methods .

the global minimizer chosen from the set of local mini- mizers is the local minimizer py0 with minimal function value.various other strategies for global optimization can be applied such as simulated annealing  evolutionary algorithms  or particle swarm optimization methods .it has been established that single shooting methods are not robust to initial guesses p0 and y0 which in this case refers to the methods' ability to successfully find minimizers as defined in .

we use a latin hypercube sam- pling but this approach can be adapted easily to different sampling methods such as a monte carlo sampling or a predetermined set of sample points.finally gauss-newton type methods are gradient based methods socubic spline functions for s and for s  s1... sn the approximationthat we can find the structures for m s f c and their correspondingvariable y in the model with an approximation s. in our case we useerror for each sj  s3a b j  1 ... n is bounded using the theoremtheorem 2.1 .
