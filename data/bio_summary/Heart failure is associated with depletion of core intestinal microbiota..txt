type 2 diabetes.4 Recent publications suggest that intestinal dysbiosis may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure putting forward a gut hypothesis of heart failure.5Recently it has been reported that HF is associated with disrupted intestinal epithelial function likely as a conse- quence of reduced intestinal perfusion and ischemia.67 Bowel wall thickness and epithelial permeability increase whereas absorptive function decreases.8 It has been proposed that in- testinal bacteria andor endotoxins such as lipopolysaccha- rides LPS translocate to the systemic circulation.9 High LPS concentrations in hepatic veins of heart failure patients are consistent with intestinal translocation processes of gutTable 1 Characteristics of HF patients and controlsmicrobes.10 LPS levels in the blood directly correlate with systemic inflammation in decompensated HF patients and decrease after recompensation.6It is well known that HF is associated with a chronic state of inflammation11 which might be induced or aggravated by this pathomechanism and thereby indirectly affect cardio- myocyte function.Of note an augmented intestinal juxtamucosal bacterial biofilm has been reported in patients with HF correlating with an enhanced immunoglobulin A-antilipopolysaccharide re- sponse.78 In patients with stable HF intestinal overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria like Campylobacter Shigella Salmonella and Yersinia as well as Candida species has been observed.12 The present study aims at a first comprehensive description of the intestinal bacterial profile in patients with acute decom- pensated or stable HF.

It is conceivable that depletion of these genera contributes to HF pathogenesis as recent findings from other inflammatory diseases suggest For example Collinsella bacteria have been reported to be associated with systemic atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM.3435 Interestingly this genus seems to be enrichedin patients suffering from atherosclerosis or T2DM whereas we could demonstrate its depletion in HF patients.

high-fat diets by excluding patients consuming unbalanced nutrition although individual effects of nutrition cannot be excluded as acute decompensated patients followed no standardized diet.

Of note recent studies have shown that intestinal bacterial-dependent generated trimethylamine-N-oxide TMAO levels in blood are a prog- nostic factor for long-term mortality risk in HF patients inde- pendent of traditional risk factors and indices.4344 In our study we focused on HF patients mostly in an acute state of decompensation.

Intra- and inter-individual analysis of bacterial diversity was performedbased on high-resolution 16S rDNA sequencing.Materials and methodsStudy populationTwenty patients with HF due to frequent etiologies like ische- mic cardiomyopathy ICMP and dilated cardiomyopathy DCM were studied.

Demographic and clinical patients' characteristics are shown in Table 1.

All patients consumed a mixed European diet.

To minimize confounding effects of hospital surrounding diet and contact to other patients we collected faecal samples within the first 24 hours after admission to hospital.The control group consisted of twenty case-matched indi- viduals matched in terms of age gender body mass index BMI and smoking status from a community-based sample free of any heart andor gastrointestinal disease as well as of cancer.

All study participants gave their written informed consent.Study protocol and clinical assessmentIn HF patients body height and weight systolic and dia- stolic blood pressure and body temperature were mea- sured by clinical staff and obtained from medical records.

In the control sample blood pressure height and weight were determined by trained study nurses following a standard- ized protocol.Body mass index BMI was calculated as weightheight.2 A standardised survey on pre-existing illnesses dietary habits and several lifestyle factors was completed by all patients and controls and a standardised interview was performed.
