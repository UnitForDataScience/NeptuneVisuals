MLST types and SNP phylogeny indicated no clustering of the UTI or faecal E. coli from patients distinct from the control faecal isolates although there was an overrepresentation of UTI isolates belonging to clonal lineages CC73 and CC12.One combination of mutations in FimH N70SS78N was significantly associated to UTI while phylogenetic analysis of FimH and fimH identified no signs of distinct adaptation of UTI isolates compared to faecal-only isolates not causing UTI.In summary the results showed that i healthy women who had never previously had UTI carried faecal E. coli which were overall closely related to UTI and faecal isolates from UTI patients ii UTI isolates do not cluster separately from faecal-only isolates based on SNP analysis and iii 22 gene families of a genomic island pu- tative T6SS proteins as well as specific metabolism and virulence associated proteins were significantly more common in UTI isolates compared to faecal-only isolates and iv evolution of fimH for these isolates was not linked to the clinical source of the isolates apart from the mutation combination N70SS78N which was cor- related to UTI isolates of phylogroup B2.

This study is to our knowledge the first to compare the isolates from the faecal flora of healthy controls who have not had UTI previously to those of patients with UTI based on a large collection of faecal and UTI E. coli isolates sampled from the same geographical area.Can the faecal flora predict UTIMLST SNP-based phylogeny and accessory genome analyses showed that healthy women who had never had UTI carried very si- milar faecal E. coli to UTI patients without this causing infection.

The faecal dominance is likely to depend on host immune status faecal flora composition and possibly the gene repertoire of the bacteria.Can UTI isolates be distinguished from faecal-only isolatesWe identified 35 proteins which were overrepresented in the UTI isolates compared to the faecal isolates that did not cause infection although UTI isolates could not be distinguished from faecal isolates based on SNP analysis.The accessory genome analysis identified 19 proteins and three DUFs which were correlated to each other and known to be situated on GEI I of E. coli Nissle 1917 strain indicating that this partial island contributes to fitness or virulence of the UTI isolates.

These utilities also contribute to UTI virulence indicating that T6SS could play a role in UTI development.Three putative proteins of T6SS were identified in the accessory genome faecal-only comparison with UTI isolates indicating that this could be a new and previously unidentified predictor for UTI.

This combination of mutations was in this study significantly more common in the UTI isolates compared to the faecal isolates and indicates that fimH aids strong intestinal binding prior to UTI development as well as the well-characterised role during adherence to uroepithelial cells.Concluding remarksThe key findings of this study were that UTI isolates do not cluster distinctly from faecal-only isolates in a phylogeny indicating that UTI isolates did not evolve distinctly from commensal E. coli.

We compared MLST types phylogenetic relationship accessory genome content and FimH type between patient and control faecal isolates as well as between UTI and faecal-only isolates respectively.Comparison of the accessory genome of UTI isolates to faecal isolates revealed 35 gene families which were significantly more prevalent in the UTI isolates compared to the faecal isolates although none of these were unique to one of the two groups.

Our results support and elaborate these results on a larger collection of clinical isolates.Additionally the results are in line with our recent study of 42 paired faecal and UTI isolates from 42 patients from the same collection of isolates which showed minimal adaptation when comparing the UTI isolate and the faecal counterpart indicating that the UTI isolate is fit in both the gut and urinary tract .
