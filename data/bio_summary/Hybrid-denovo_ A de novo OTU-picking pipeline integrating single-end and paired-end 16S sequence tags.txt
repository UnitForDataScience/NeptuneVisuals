Through simulations and real data examples we showed that our approach had better per- formance than the single-end or paired-end approach in quan- tifying the microbial diversity and taxonomic abundance due to the full use of the information in the paired-end reads.Based on the size of 16S amplicons and the length of the paired-end reads we could have overlapping or nonoverlap- ping paired-end reads.

To integrate information from both paired-end and single- end reads we propose hybrid-denovo a pipeline that combines paired-end and single-end reads in order to retain the advan- tages of de novo OTU-picking while maximizing the ability to de- tect rare taxa.MethodsHybrid-denovo first constructs an OTU backbone using only paired-end reads.

However our pipeline could also be applied to overlapping paired-end reads by using PANDAseq  to stitch the paired-end reads together.It is noted that some existing pipelines could also process a mix- ture of paired-end and single-end reads with different capac- ities.

Results To have both the higher phylogenetic resolution provided by paired-end reads and the higher sequence coverage by single-end reads we propose a novel OTU-picking pipelinehybrid-denovo that can process a hybrid of single-end and paired-end reads.

Using high-quality paired-end reads as a gold standard we show that hybrid-denovo achieved the highest correlation with the gold standard and performed better than the approaches based on paired-end or single-end reads in terms of quantifying the microbial diversity and taxonomic abundances.

Conclusions Hybrid-denovo utilizes both paired-end and single-end 16S sequencing reads and is recommended for 16S rRNA gene targeted paired-end sequencing data.Keywords microbiome OTU picking 16S rRNAIntroductionThe microbiome plays an important role in global ecology nutrient cycling and disease .

For the paired-end approach genera with low abundance exhibited a lower corre- lation indicating the decreased quantification accuracy due to loss of paired-end reads.We also compared hybrid-denovo with mothur and QIIME the 2 predominant pipelines for 16S data based on the gold standard data set.

For example sequencing of the V4 region 252 nt 515F806R primers produces overlapping paired-end reads while sequencing of the V3-V5 region 694 nt F357R926 primers results in nonoverlapping paired-end reads using Illu- mina MiSeq 250 bp x 2.
