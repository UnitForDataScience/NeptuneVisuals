we tested whether and how precipitation change alters bac- terial and fungal diversity in the soil surface and whether the responses to irrigation penetrate in the mineral subsurface soil horizons.

four replicate samples were collected at four different locations in each of the eight plots at least 5 m distance from the plot edge at three soil depths that is the organic f-horizon org as well as at 0-2 cm depth min2 and 5-10 cm depth min10 of the mineral soil.

this gave a total of 24 soil samples 2 treatments 9 4 independent plots 9 3 soil horizons.

soil organic c soc stock was deter- mined by multiplying soc concentrations with the bulk densities and the volume of the corresponding soil layers considering the stone contents.fine root sampling was executed twice that is inmay 2003 and in may 2012 each time before the irriga- tion started.

the fine roots were sampled by sampling four soil cores at a distance of 1 m from each of three trees per plot with soil coring cylinder o 45 mm and analysed according to herzog et al.
