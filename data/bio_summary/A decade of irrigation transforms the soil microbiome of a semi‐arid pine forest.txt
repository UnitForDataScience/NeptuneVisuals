This unique long-term study provides new insights into the impact of precipitation changes on the soil microbiome and associated ecosystem functioning in a water-limited pine forest ecosystem and improves our understanding of the persistency of long-term soil carbon stocks in a changing climate.Received 10 September 2016 revision received 18 November 2016 accepted 19 December 2016IntroductionClimate scenarios for the late twenty-first century fore- cast continued global warming and an increased fre- quency and intensity of extreme climatic events Zhao  Running 2010 Seneviratne et al.

In particular little is known about the effect of longer term changes in soil water availability on the soil micro- bial communities and associated ecosystem functions.

We tested whether and how precipitation change alters bac- terial and fungal diversity in the soil surface and whether the responses to irrigation penetrate in the mineral subsurface soil horizons.

Four replicate samples were collected at four different locations in each of the eight plots at least 5 m distance from the plot edge at three soil depths that is the organic F-Horizon Org as well as at 0-2 cm depth Min2 and 5-10 cm depth Min10 of the mineral soil.

This gave a total of 24 soil samples 2 treatments 9 4 independent plots 9 3 soil horizons.
