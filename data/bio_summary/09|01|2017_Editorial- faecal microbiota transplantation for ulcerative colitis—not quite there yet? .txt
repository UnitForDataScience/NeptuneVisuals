have provided an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of faecal microbiota transplantation fmt in patients with ulcerative colitis uc1 which had more randomised controlled trials rcts than previous meta-analyses including two recent australian based rcts.23 a number of important questions relating to fmt use in uc were highlighted.paramsothy et al.2 and costello et al.3 required participants to undergo a mandatory oral corticosteroid taper and reported similar rates of steroid-free remission 27 and 32 respectively despite using fmt regimens of vastly different intensities raising the ques- tion of optimum intensity and duration of fmt in uc.

pooled donors were used in these two studies while moayyedi et al.4 used single donors and reported that seven of nine participants in clinical remis- sion after fmt received donation from a single donor with a taxo- nomic profile showing significant enrichment for the family lachnospiraceae and the genera ruminococcus.
