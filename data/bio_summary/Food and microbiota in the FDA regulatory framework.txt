Although marketing a new product under the over-the-counter drug mono- graph system can be complex if an MDF is composed entirely of existing foodstuffs an abbreviated review process could focus on defining allowable claims and labeling.FOOD AND THE MICROBIOTATo what extent will scientific advances in microbiota research affect public attitudes and governmental regulation How will regulatory decisions in turn affect scientific progress and society MDFs offer research opportunities to i delineate how microbialClassification schemes that are ultimately adopted will likely have broad societal implications for...products that target the microbiota.communities affect our biology ii deter- mine the extent to which it is possible to re- shape community functions through dietary interventions iii characterize the generaliz- ability of these effects and their short- and long-term safety and efficacy and iv catalyze efforts to identify bioactive natural products derived from gut microbiota.

We can gain greaterunderstanding of how microbial commu- nities transform foods into products and which of these products are important con- tributors to normal healthy physiologic functions.

The challenge is to determine which of these microbiota-derived products are common features of a healthy human being how the term common is related to age gender and anthropologic features of a population what concentration range is as- sociated with a healthy state and whether deficiency of one or more of these products is causally linked to an unhealthy state.

There is rapid growth in the number of products that claim to affect the gut microbiota and benefit health.P OL I C Y F ORU MSCIENCE AND REGULATIONFood and microbiota in the FDA regulatory frameworkHow should microbiota-directed foods be regulatedmicrobiota in ways that increase microbial production of a nutrient necessary for a healthy state would the MDF be consid- ered a food One way of distinguishing a conventional food from an MDF is that the former is not designed to specifically alter the properties of the microbiota whereas the latter is intentionally formulated with this goal in mind.

Note that it is not the substance itself that underlies GRAS designation but rather its manner of use moreover there is noBy Jonathan M. Green12Michael J. Barratt34 Michael Kinch5 Jeffrey I. Gordon34ew understanding of how our gut microbial communities microbiota transform dietary ingredients into metabolic products that affect hu- man biology is altering our defini- tions of the nutritional value of foods1 2.

Email approaches to regulation vary among coun- tries 9 we focus on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA because of its global influence and because the products it regulates are often widely distributed.It has been more than 20 years since the last major revision of regulatory definitions for food ingredients in the United States.

Growing appreciation of how the microbiota generates biomolecules that are not produced by any of our human cell lineages and that affect our health status is forcing us to evolve our con- cept of essential nutrients to include some of these microbial products 10 11.

A micro- biota that cannot generate these products in adequate quantities may lead to disease and is thus a target for reconfiguration by MDFs which can be defined as foods designed to al- ter properties of a microbiota.

An MDF could alter existing members of the consumer's mi- crobiota in a deliberate manner to affect the community's functional properties andor it may provide a substrate that is transformed by the microbiota to products necessary for a healthy state.POTENTIAL CLASSIFICATIONSIf an MDF is designed primarily to provide nutritive value a key question is whether such nutritive value has to be provided di- rectly by the MDF for it to be classified as a conventional food by the FDA i.e.

Key questions in- clude whether the condition is recognized by the scientific community as having dis- tinctive nutritional requirements and the extent to which the definition of essential nutrient is expanded to include products of microbial metabolism.Because dietary practices are known to al- ter microbiota configuration and metabolic output e.g.
