An increasing body of evidence suggests possible roles of microbes in the development of pancreatic tumors .Experimental evidence in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer suggests that lipopolysaccharide can activate TLR4 on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and promote pancreatic tumor development through activation of the NFKB and MAPK signaling pathways in immune cells .Epidemiologic studies have shown positive associations of oral inflammation periodontitis with an increased risk of develop- ment of pancreatic cancer .

Although there are few experi- mental studies on microbes in relation to biliary tract cancers epidemiologic studies have shown associations of microbes and microbial dysbiosis with the development of biliary tract cancer .Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated associations between Helicobacter species including H. pylori Helicobacter bilis and Helicobacter hepatics and an increased risk of biliary tract cancers e. Experimental evidence suggests that H. bilis can activate the NFKB signaling pathway and increase the production of VEGF which leads to enhancement of angiogenesis in human bile duct cancer cell lines .Clinical studies using metagenomic analyses have shown that Bifidobacteriaceae Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae are enriched in tumor tissue specimens of cholangiocarcinoma asso- ciated with liver fluke O. viverrini compared with chol- angiocarcinoma not associated with O. viverrini  and that the amount of Nesterenkonia was decreased whereas the amounts of Methylophilaceae Fusobacterium Prevotella Actinomyces Novos- phingobium and Helicobacer pylori were increased in distal chol- angiocarcinoma tissue specimens compared with non-cancer tissue specimens .Gallbladder cancer is frequent in India and Pakistan but rare in the Western world .

Hence a better understanding of roles of the gut microbiota in the development and progression of hepatobiliary-pancreatic tumors may open opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients with hepatobiliary-pancreatic cancer through manipulating the gut microbiota by diet lifestyle antibiotics and pro- and prebiotics.c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.IntroductionHepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers have been associated with poor prognosis owing to their high level of tumor invasiveness distant metastasis and resistance to conventional treatment op- tions such as chemotherapy e. Accumulating evidence in- dicates that hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers develop through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations which is influenced by host immunity diet and environmental and micro- bial exposures e.The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion 1014 microorganisms that can influence host metabolism the immune system and disease conditions including obesity and cancer .

Future investigations are necessary to examine the effects of oral microbes on the development of pancreatic tumors.Accumulating evidence demonstrates that Fusobacterium nucleatum which has been associated with periodontitis is enriched in human gastrointestinal tract neoplasms e and can inhibit the antitumor immune response and potentiate colonic neoplasia development in animal models e. Mitsuhashi et al.

Clinical studies using meta- genomic analyses suggest that high amounts of pathogenic periodontal microbes such as Neisseria elongata and Porphyr- omonas gingivalis in the saliva are associated with an increased risk of development of pancreatic cancer .

Reactive oxygen species ROS are important for DNA damage and apoptosis in response toTable 3Experimental and clinical studies on microbes in relation to pancreatic cancers.Clinical studies The presence of Helicobacter pylori is associated with anFindings Referencesincreased risk of biliary tract cancers 59e62.

In fact clinical studies have shown that intestinal microbial dysbiosis is associated with the progression of NASH eand liver cirrhosis e. These findings from ani- mal models and human studies suggest that the guteliver axis may potentiate inflammation and fibrosis in the liver which have been shown to promote liver tumor development.
