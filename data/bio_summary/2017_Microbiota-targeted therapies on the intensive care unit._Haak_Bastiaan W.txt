The results of this study show that microbiome diversity of many critical care patients decreases sharply upon admission at the ICU and that these changes are even more pro- nounced at a second time point later in the ICU stay 20In general microbial ecosystems of the mouth the skin and the gut become overrun by bacterial genera that are known to be associated with invasive disease and antibacterial resistance such as Enterobacter spp.

For example gut microbiota disruption by broad-spectrum anti- biotics does not affect systemic innate immune responses during endotoxemia in healthy humans 14This review aims to offer critical care providers an evidence base on what we currently know about the role of the microbiome in critical illness and how the microbiome could practically be targeted to potentially improve ICU-related outcomes.DYSBIOSIS ON THE ICU - WHAT DO WE CURRENTLY KNOWCritical illness alters the physiological status of the host which is thought to profoundly distort thecomposition and diversity of the intestinal micro- biome a state that is known as 'dysbiosis'.

- which is known to have anti-inflammatory properties - is decimated in critical care patients 17181920 Furthermore one of the most striking and disturbing discoveries was that micro- biome composition of some critically ill patients resembled more that of a decomposing corpse than anything else 20 The consequences of these shifts remain to be further elucidated but it is likely that the state of extreme dysbiosis sometimes referred to as the pathobiome is highly unfavorable and could potentially be associated with sepsis- associated immunosuppression 22 This state is defined by a diminished capacity of mononuclear cells to produce tumor necrosis factor TNF-a upon ex-vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide with concomitant risk of nosocomial infections and increased mortality Of interest circulating mononuclear cells of healthy human study partici- pants which are pretreated with a short course of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics to disrupt the microbiota show a significant defect in their capacity to produce TNF-a after ex-vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.

Schematic overview of all factors in the ICU that are suggested to drive the state of dysbiosis during critical illness.168Volume 23  Number 2  April 2017Microbiota-targeted therapies on the intensive care unit Haak et al.in a recently published cohort of fecal oral and skin microbiomes of 115 mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU.

In addition FMT has recently been used beyond the indication of C. difficile as two case reports indicated that this treatment modality could be successfully used in the treatment of therapy-resistant sepsis and diarrhea 44The limited data available based on these experiences show that recolonization of the intes- tinal microbiota via FMT could counterbalance dys- biosis induce recovery of gut microbial barrier and aid in the treatment of sepsis on the ICU.

1.Indeed an increasing amount of studies have characterized the composition of the microbiota in critically ill patients as three recent pilot studies of 12 14 and 34 ICU patients found marked shifts in gut microbiota composition compared with healthy controls 171819These changes were confirmedFIGURE 1.

A steep decrease in sequencing costs will allow us to com- bine several other sequencing techniques such as shotgun metagenomics metatranscriptomics and metabolomics These techniques could provide insights into how our microbiome is functionally changing over the course of critical illness and how these pathways could be modified to promote recov- ery of disease.CONCLUSIONSThe composition of the microbiota undergoes rapid and extreme changes during critical illness.

The advent of several inter- national cohorts that prospectively sample a huge variety of human volunteers who in turn might become critically ill at some time point can potentially help us to answer these questions in the future.MICROBIOTA-TARGETED THERAPY IN THE ICU - WHAT THERAPIES DO WE CURRENTLY HAVEAs it has become clear that dysbiosis on the ICU appears to be extreme and that this state might be associated with poor outcome it is understandable that microbiota-targeted interventions are increas- ingly investigated.

This diminished capacity to produce TNF-a was restored only 6 weeks after cessation of antibiotic therapy 24To further support the hypothesis that dysbiosis in the ICU is associated with worse outcome it has been shown that alterations in the intestinal micro- biota influence gut barrier dysfunction and increased cellular apoptosis 12 This process facilitates translocation of pathogenic bacteria into the systemic and lymphatic circulation and poten- tially contributes to the complex chain of events that lead to multiple organ dysfunction 12Strik- ingly experimental models have indeed shown that the microbiota modulates the development of acute kidney injury 2627 and sepsis-induced muscle wasting 28All these studies endorse that more insight into the consequences of dysbiosis in critical illness is needed.
