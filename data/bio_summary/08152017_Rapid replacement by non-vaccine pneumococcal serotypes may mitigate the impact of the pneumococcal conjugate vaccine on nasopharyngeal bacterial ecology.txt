nasopharyngeal carriage of pcv7 serotypes in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 and 3 p  0.01.however pneumococcal carriage remained comparable due to an expansion of non-vaccine serotypes in groups 2 and 3. determination of phylogenetic dissimilarities showed that the bacterial community structures were comparable across groups.

in this unique study of infants followed up from birth to 1 year with intensive sampling we have demonstrated that while pcv7 vacci- nation effectively reduces the nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes pneumococcal carriage remains high above 75 among vaccinated infants due to an immediate expansion of non-vaccine serotypes throughout the first year of life.

group 1 was the control unvaccinated group in the initial study design however infants recruited into this group received pcv7 once it was introduced in the gambia in august 2009. pcv7 was replaced by pcv13 in 2011 in the gambia and it is unclear if the higher valency formulations will have similar impact on the nasopharyngeal microbiome.the evidence presented here strongly suggests that as vaccine serotypes are cleared from the nasopharyngeal ecological niche they are rapidly replaced by non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and not other bacterial spe- cies.

the issue of replace- ment in carriage and disease is of particular interest within the gambian context where infant pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage rates exceed 90 and pcv7 protects against approximately 63 of previously circulating serotypes .

following a small study of an experimental pentavelent crm197 pcv among children obaro and colleagues reported a reduction in the carriage of vaccine types which was countered by a com- mensurate increase in the carriage of non-vaccine serotypes.

group 1 and 2 participants were born in pcv7 unvaccinated villages while group 3 participants were born in heavily vaccinated communities following the pcv7 vaccine trials conducted in 2006. group 2 and 3 infants received three doses of pcv7 at 2 3 and 4 months whereas group 1 infants did not receive pcv7 at this age.

a pre-pcv longitudinal study of pneumococcal carriage among gambian infants showed that serotype 35b was amongst the most commonly isolated serotypes at first acquisition and was amongst the predominant serotypes accounting for just below 4 of pneumococcal isolates.

kaplan meier survival curves were usedto compare the rates to first acquisition of pneumococcus and pcv7 serotypes in the three study groups.

a total of 102 children were recruited into each of the study groups as follows group 1 n 33 group 2n  30 and group 3 n 39. the baseline characteristics of the newborns recruited into in each of the study groups are summarised in table .

this is consistent with findings from a small study conducted among 60 chil- dren aged 12-59 months in kenya in which the 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable haemophilus influenzae protein-d conjugate vaccine phid-cv was not found to significantly alter the nasopharyngeal microbiome.although a few studies have reported changes in the carriage of other pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae that co-colonise the nasopharynx following pcv vaccination- it is not clear if there is a link with nasopharyngeal carriage dynamics.

the 7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-diphtheria crm197 protein conjugate vaccine pcv7 was licensed in 2000 and markedly reduced the carriage of vaccine serotypes and the incidence of invasive disease-.

a birth cohort of 102 gambian newborns recruited into three groups with distinct pcv7 vaccine exposures was rigorously sampled for one year to address this question.resultscharacteristics of study participants.
