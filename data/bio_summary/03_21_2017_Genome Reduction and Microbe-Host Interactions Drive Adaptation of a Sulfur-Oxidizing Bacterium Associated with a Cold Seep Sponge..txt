of type II secretion system genes1100081212aThe reference genomes include two endosymbionts from vent clams Candidatus Ruthia magnifica strain Cm Rmag and Candidatus Vesicomyosocius okutanii strain Voku two extracellular SOB in sponges the SOB in the deep-sea glass sponge Lophophysema Glop and in the shallow water sponge Haliclona Ghal and two free-living relative SOB Thioalkalivibrio sulfidophilus HL-EbGr7 Tsul from shallow water and Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2 Tcru from the deep sea.Vesicomyosocius okutanii strain HA Voku from vent clams   the comparison also included two potential sponge symbiont SOB the SOB in the deep-sea glass sponge Lophophysema Glop and in the shallow water sponge Haliclona Ghal   and two free-living SOB Thioalkalivibrio sulfidophilus HL-EbGr7 Tsul and Thiomicro- spira crunogena XCL-2 Tcru from shallow and deep water environments .

To further investigate the association between Gsub and the sponge fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH experiments were performed using sponge sections with a Gsub-specific probe for the 16S rRNA gene and the results found Gsub in extracellular positions in the sponge Fig.

The microor- ganisms in the sponge body can reach up to 40 of the sponge weight and are mainly distributed in the mesophyll layer .

Although the molecules that are introduced into sponge cells by the Gsub bacterium remain unknown the presence of T2SS suggests the potential for direct interaction between Gsub and the host sponge.

However Gsub has retained genes for phage defense and protein secretion with the latter potentially playing a role in interactions with the sponge host.

oxidative stress resistance genes were reduced in symbiotic members of the Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum group and the authors proposed that the barrier of the sponge body prevents sunlight from arriving at the cyanobacterial symbiont avoiding oxidative damage.In the DNA repair category the MutL-MutS system was absent in Gsub Rmag and Voku while present in Glop Ghal Tsul and Tcru  and .

The reduced bacterial motility in Gsub implies that symbionts in the sponge body are sessile and do not need to move in response to chemical signals as either a response to stress or a strategy of nutrient acquisition.Immunity and virulence genes in Gsub.

These microorganisms in hosts lack genes that are essential in other bacteria and retain only the most essential functions such as sets of genes that serve the hosts .

The sequencing coverages of the contigs where the 16S rRNA genes located were taken as the coverages of the 16S rRNA genes and were considered their relative abundance.

The Pfam-based 139 conserved single-copy genes were also identified showing that the Gsub genome contains no duplicated genes Table S2.
