mix by vortexing before pouring the cells onto a solid mrs agar plate 1.5 agar.dry the plate by taking the lid off for 5 - 10 min in the sterile hood before incubating the cells for 20 - 24 h at 30 degc for cell growth and colony formation.count bacteriocin-producing cells.transfer diluted cells 100 ul of the bacteriocin producer to 4 ml of prewarmed mrs soft agar 50 degc 0.8 agar mix by vortexing and pour the cells onto an mrs agar plate 1.5 agar this layer is referred to as the first layer.transfer another 4 ml of cell-free mrs soft agar 0.8 agar onto the first layer to embed all cells within the soft agar.note this layer is meant to prevent cells from growing as colonies on the surface of the agar plates.

grow them at 30 degc for 20 - 24 h.note strains used in this study are listed in table 1.harvest cells by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 20 min at 4 degc.remove the supernatant and wash the cells twice by suspending each cell pellet in 100 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline pbs and collecting the cells as in step 1.3.after the second wash suspend each cell pellet in 20 ml of ice-cold 15 glycerol in pbs.aliquot the cell suspension into 1-ml volumes in tubes and then store them at -80 degc until use.

mix extracted dna with 2 volumes 200 ul of buffer nti to adjust the binding conditions for step 5.15.place a silica membrane containing pcr clean-up column into a collection tube 2 ml and load the sample.centrifuge for 30 s at 11000 x g. discard the flow-through.wash the silica membrane with 700 ul of buffer nt3 and repeat step 5.16.dry the silica membrane by centrifugation for 1 min at 11000 x g to remove any residual ethanol containing wash buffer nt3.transfer the column to a new 1.5-ml microtube and incubate for 2 - 5 min at 70 degc for the total removal of the ethanol.add 30 ul of pcr-grade water and incubate for 5 min at 70 degc.

use sterile micropestles for 1.5 ml tubes to homogenize the fecal suspension and prepare ten-fold serial dilutions in ice-cold 0.9 nacl.count the total number of lab cells.transfer diluted cells 100 ul to 4 ml of prewarmed man rogosa sharpe mrs soft agar 50 degc 0.8 agar.

realpure sss kit.suspend 1 - 2 fecal mice pellets 200 mg in 300 ul of lysis solution.transfer the sample to a 2 ml microtube in which about 0.5 g of glass beads diameter 0.1 mm have previously been placed.add 1 ul of mutanolysin at 10 uul and 2 ul of lysozyme at 20 mgml to each sample and incubate at 37 degc for 40 - 60 min.

collect the following fecal samples on days 7 14 21 and 28.refrigerate the samples at 4 degc until their transport to the laboratory where they are frozen at -80 degc.

proceed with one of the standard protocols for dna extraction from fecal samples12.apply two cycles of bead-beater steps 1 min each.add 2 ul of proteinase k and mix thoroughly.incubate for 20 min and vortex every 5 min.cool the samples to 37 degc and add 1 ul of 5 ugml rnase a to the sample.

allow it to defecate and collect 2 - 4 fecal pellets using sterile forceps placing them into 1.5 ml tubes.note sometimes it is enough to hold the mouse tail upwards the stool can then be directly collected from the anus into a tube.collect fecal samples from each mouse once a week during the four-week experiment figure 1. collect the first samples on day one t0 time zero just before the exposure of the mice to bacteria.

plan in advance and provide enough storage boxes as a large number of fecal samples will be collected during the experiment.weigh all mice every week on fecal collection day.collect blood samples from the facial vein from all mice on 15th day the last day of bacteria administration and determine the levels of triglycerides total cholesterol high-density lipoprotein hdl and low-density lipoprotein ldl in the blood serum.note experienced personnel should collect the blood to reduce stress in the animals.lab counting and bacteriocin activityweigh one fecal pellet of each sample in a 1.5 ml tube and add an adequate volume of ice-cold 0.9 nacl to achieve a 10 wv solution.

note cells should be used within 1-2 months after this point.determine the cell number before storage and prior to administration so that the number of live cells given to mice is known.for cell counting make ten-fold serial dilutions of cells in ice-cold 0.9 sodium chloride nacl solution.

the importance of the dna extraction method must not be underestimated as bacterial cells present in the samples are not all equally sensitive to different lysis protocols and biases in the estimation of the bacterial populations can result from incomplete lysis.

procedures described here were approved by the corresponding ethics committee of the university of valencia and local authorities following the principles of laboratory animal care mandatory by european union law and 201063eu and the spanish government rd 532013 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes in order to respect the 3r principle in animal experimentation replacement reduction refinement.frozen bacterial cultures used to inoculate miceinoculate individual strains of lab in 5 ml of brain-heart infusion bhi medium and grow them for 20 - 24 h overnight at 30 degc.dilute each overnight bacterial culture 100-fold in bhi by transferring 2 ml of overnight culture to 200 ml of bhi.

incubate overnight 20 - 24 h at 30 degc for cell growth and colony formation the latter to determine colony- forming units cfuml.to make bacteria-containing drinking water dilute cells of each bacterial stock culture in 100 ml of sterile filtered drinking water with a final average cfu of 109ml of water.

mix thoroughly.incubate at 37 degc for 30 - 60 min.cool the samples to room temperature and add 180 ul of protein precipitation solution.

if there are any particles floating in the supernatant incubate the samples in ice for 5 min and then centrifuge again.transfer the supernatant containing the dna to a new 1.5-ml microtube containing 300 ul of isopropanol.mix by inverting the tubes 20-30 times and incubate for 1 h at -20 degc.
