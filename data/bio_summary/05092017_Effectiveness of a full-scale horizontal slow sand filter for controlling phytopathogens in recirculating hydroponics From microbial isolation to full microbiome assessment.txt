All culturable microbial groups were also isolated from the sand bed in numbers that were generally higher than those previously reported in the nutrient solution pointing to the fact that a microbial biofilm was active in the sand bed.Microbial counts were also performed in relation to naturally occur- ring Fusarium spp.

This unspecific contribution of the Schmutzdecke would account for the observed attachment of F. oxysporum spores to the sand grains  and ultimately to the greater efficiency of slow sand filters under prolonged operation such as that used in the present study.

These nitrogen- fixing bacteria were relatively abundant in the sand bed 1.2-2.3 the nutrient solution 2.5 and in the resulting leachate 2.0 and might therefore contribute to the buildup of nitrogen observed in the HSSF drainage .Concerning the fungi and in agreement with the previous quantita- tive results A Fusarium oxysporum was still one of the predomi- nant species in the sand bed 32 days after its inoculation B.

The viability of retained Fusarium cells tended to decrease in time so that treatment efficiency might be enhanced by antagonistic species from the genera Bacillus Pseudomonas and Trichoderma also identified in the sand bed.

The typical VSSF configuration consists of a vertical tank either encased in the soil or in an external container filled with several layers of sand and gravel with different particle sizes.

The DGGE method though also has some shortcomings for the study of complex microbial communities in that only a small fraction of the dominant species is depicted and ultimately identified.The present study has been carried out using an innovative horizon- tal-flow slow sand filter HSSF located under the production area of an outdoor container-grown culture and constitutes the first process of the combined system CLEANLEACHr .

The HSSF was housed in the ground 6.9 m wide by 27.5 m long with a two-sided bot- tom slope of the 20 below de cropping area and consisted of a surface layer of sand 10-15 cm thick .

The sand bed was isolated from the ground by a GG1000 polyethylene film and from the top crop containers by a mulch fabric.
