The neutrophil infiltration which was correlated with a significant increased colonic MPO level was detected in DSS-treated mice but was much mitigated in the bacterial consortium-treated mice .BcT Decreased the gut Permeability of Dss-Treated Mice by Upregulating the expression of Tight Junction Protein OccludinTo further characterize the protective effects of the bacterial con- sortium on the epithelial layer in DSS-treated mice we quantified the permeability by orally administering FITC-dextran to mice and measuring the serum levels.

Although the transcripts of Ocln mRNA in BCT mice were still lower than in control mice when tested by immunofluores- cence we found that the cellular localization of occludin was less impacted by DSS treatment which was localized on the apical surface of the cell  in contrast to the intracellular occludin staining observed in the DSS group of mice.

Bacteroidetes and Clostridia which were most abundant in the control mice and Proteobacteria Diferribacteres and Enterobactriales which were most abundant in the DSS mice were the dominant phylotypes that contributed to the differences between the intestinal microbiota of control and DSS-treated mice .

Here we showed that a defined bacterial consortium derived from healthy mice was able to enhance the intestinal barrier function of mice with dextran sulfate sodium DSS-induced colitis.

Using a consortium of 10 bacterial strains that were isolated from fecal samples of healthy mice we have previously shown that BCT and FMT were comparable in re-establishing mucosal barrier function in mice with intestinal dysbiosis .

Given the important regulatory role of gut microbes and gdT cells in regulating occludin we therefore hypothesized that the IL-17A-producing gdT gdT17 cells mightbe involved in the protection mechanism of the bacterial consor- tium on colon mucosa.In this study we showed that transplantation of the bacterial consortium resulted in the reduction of gut permeability and improvement of intestinal dysbiosis in mice with DSS-induced colitis and it also resulted in the elevation of gdT17 cells in coloniclamina propria cLP of mice.

Results showed that the diffusion of FITC-dextran through the epithelium after DSS treatment was significantly increased in the intestines of mice  on day 3 and day 7 and it was compromised in the BCT group of mice.

Compared with the control group the DSS-treated mice and BCT mice had a decreased number of OTUs.

We did not detect any biomarkers in BCT mice which suggest that the manipulation of microbiota by the bacterial consortium mainly may contribute to the recovery of disrupted intestinal homeostasis rather than establishing a new unique microbiota.changing of specific Bacterial groups Was correlated with gdT cellsWith the aim of clarifying how changing of intestinal microbialstructure affects gdT cells we analyzed the spearman correlationFigUre 3  BCT upregulated IL-17 gdT cells in colonic lamina propria cLP of colitis mice.

In addition Helicobacter ganmani which are some of the most prevalent bacterial contaminants of laboratory mice were found associated with alterations in inflammatory cytokines in IL10-deficient mice .
