the neutrophil infiltration which was correlated with a significant increased colonic mpo level was detected in dss-treated mice but was much mitigated in the bacterial consortium-treated mice .bct decreased the gut permeability of dss-treated mice by upregulating the expression of tight junction protein occludinto further characterize the protective effects of the bacterial con- sortium on the epithelial layer in dss-treated mice we quantified the permeability by orally administering fitc-dextran to mice and measuring the serum levels.

bacteroidetes and clostridia which were most abundant in the control mice and proteobacteria diferribacteres and enterobactriales which were most abundant in the dss mice were the dominant phylotypes that contributed to the differences between the intestinal microbiota of control and dss-treated mice .

we did not detect any biomarkers in bct mice which suggest that the manipulation of microbiota by the bacterial consortium mainly may contribute to the recovery of disrupted intestinal homeostasis rather than establishing a new unique microbiota.changing of specific bacterial groups was correlated with gdt cellswith the aim of clarifying how changing of intestinal microbialstructure affects gdt cells we analyzed the spearman correlationfigure 3  bct upregulated il-17 gdt cells in colonic lamina propria clp of colitis mice.

may benefit from the re-established balance between gut microbiota and intestinal immune system and in turn exert beneficial effects on colon mucosa.in conclusion our results suggest that bct can restore the alliance between commensal microbiota and intestinal gdt17 cells through the manipulation of intestinal dysbiosis in dss- treated mice and this contributes to the improvement of mucosal barrier function which is closely associated with the upregula- tion of the il-17a-act1-occludin regulatory pathway.

although the transcripts of ocln mrna in bct mice were still lower than in control mice when tested by immunofluores- cence we found that the cellular localization of occludin was less impacted by dss treatment which was localized on the apical surface of the cell  in contrast to the intracellular occludin staining observed in the dss group of mice.

here we showed that a defined bacterial consortium derived from healthy mice was able to enhance the intestinal barrier function of mice with dextran sulfate sodium dss-induced colitis.

using a consortium of 10 bacterial strains that were isolated from fecal samples of healthy mice we have previously shown that bct and fmt were comparable in re-establishing mucosal barrier function in mice with intestinal dysbiosis .

given the important regulatory role of gut microbes and gdt cells in regulating occludin we therefore hypothesized that the il-17a-producing gdt gdt17 cells mightbe involved in the protection mechanism of the bacterial consor- tium on colon mucosa.in this study we showed that transplantation of the bacterial consortium resulted in the reduction of gut permeability and improvement of intestinal dysbiosis in mice with dss-induced colitis and it also resulted in the elevation of gdt17 cells in coloniclamina propria clp of mice.

we therefore tested the expression of il-17rc and act1 in colon tissue by wb and found that bct improved the expression of these proteins which was significantly decreased in dss-treated mice .the intestinal gdt17 cells were upregulated by bctprevious study had shown that after acute intestinal injury the intestinal-protective il-17a could regulate the tight junction protein occludin to limit excessive permeability and maintain barrier integrity .

when purified gdt cells were challenged with the bacterial consortium in vitro we detected an expansion of tlr2 gdt cells  as well as an elevated il-17a concentration in the cell culture supernatant  which suggests thatthe tlr2 signaling pathway may be involved in the secretion of il-17a from gdt cells.bct benefited the re-establishment of intestinal bacterial equilibriumwe have previously shown that administration of the bacterial con- sortium promoted the recovery of intestinal microbial equilibrium in mice with ceftriaxione-induced dysbiosis as well as in rats withtnbs-induced colitis  .

results showed that the diffusion of fitc-dextran through the epithelium after dss treatment was significantly increased in the intestines of mice  on day 3 and day 7 and it was compromised in the bct group of mice.

we detected an even higher concentration of il-17a in mice that received bct at both day 3 and day 7. in addition the mrna expressions of il17a and rorgt were significantly upregulated in bct mice compared with that of the dss group  which confirmed the elevation of il-17a secretion in colon mucosa.

compared with the control group the dss-treated mice and bct mice had a decreased number of otus.

in addition helicobacter ganmani which are some of the most prevalent bacterial contaminants of laboratory mice were found associated with alterations in inflammatory cytokines in il10-deficient mice .
