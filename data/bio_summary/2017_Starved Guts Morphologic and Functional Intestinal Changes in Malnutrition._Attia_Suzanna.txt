histologically eed is characterized by villous atrophy crypt hyperplasia loss of tight junctions and an influx of inflammatory cells into the lining of the intestine and is further reviewed by syed et al and crane et al eed is also associated with stunting even in the presence of adequate caloric intake and likely exacerbates the intestinal changes associated with malnutrition as areas with eed tend to have a high burden of malnutrition the overlap of eed with malnutrition enteropathy can be impossible to distinguish in the majority of human research settings.human histologic studies in malnutrition reveal changes similar to chronic intestinal inflammatory diseasesacross time and regions including initial studies from the 1950s morphologic studies of intestinal biopsies from children withjpgn  volume 65 number 5 november 2017491figure 1. intestinal alterations in malnutrition enteropathy.

the addition of an infectious insult with rota- virus in the piglet model exacerbated the changes in permeability seen with malnutrition alone one murine model of malnutrition 7 protein diet demon- strated increased serum fitc and a reduction in the mrna of tight junction protein 1 and increase in claudin-2 a paracellular protein which increases inversely with intestinal permeability compared to controls this mechanistic change likely contributes to morbidity as dysregulated intestinal absorption and increased mortality rates have been observed in claudin-2 and claudin-15 knockout mice although the exact mechanism relating malnutrition to changes in intestinal tight junction and paracellular proteins remains unclear.utilizing the in vivo gold standard of dual sugar absorption test impaired intestinal barrier function in malnutrition has been repeatedly demonstrated since 1967 with an inverse relation to anthropometric measurements of weight for height standardized scores whz changes in intestinal permeability are further detailed in a 2014 review by genton et al the link between intestinal permeability and intestinal and systemic inflam- mation has been studied as a target of therapy outside of malnu- trition such as with inflammatory bowel disease for example a pilot trial with the inflammatory bowel disease treatment agent mesalazine was recently performed in children with sam the role of the supraepithelial mucous layer and goblet cells in malnutritionimpairment of the intraluminal mucin layer due to malnu- trition was first experimentally described in the 1960s with the demonstration of a variable decrease in goblet cell number in both malnourished rats and pigs  although these changes were not well characterized.

there were no differences in paneth and goblet cell differentiation at 24 hours 8 however there were attenuated histologic changes and reduced apoptosis similar to the changes observed by ueno et al in alanine and glutamine- supplemented protein-restricted mouse models.enteroendocrine cells and malnutritionthe examination of enteroendocrine cells of the intestine is not well reported in human studies of moderate to severe malnu- trition however other studies into the role of enteroendocrine products in obesity anorexia and cachexia have led to enteroendo- crine hormones as a subject of clinical intervention such as the use of ghrelin in the treatment of cachexia enteroendocrine cells are known to respond in a complex fashion to intestinal contents and to the fed and fasted states they were not found to change in quantity in yilmaz et al's mouse model of 28 week 60 calorie restriction but have not been reported in models of more severe calorie or protein restriction.conclusionsintestinal changes in malnutrition encompass a spectrum of quantitative and qualitative changes.

the pronut study demonstrated the safety of probiotic administration to children with sam but showed no efficacy in improving diarrheal or nutritional outcomes the relationship of intestinal microbial changes to malnutrition has been recently reviewed by million et al it is important to note that the role of intestinal viruses and parasites in relation to alteration of systemic inflam- mation and malnutrition outcomes is poorly characterized.

most commonly in malnourished models mice have been fed a low-protein diet in comparison to the isocaloric 18 to 20 protein diet of mouse controls mice rats pigs and rhesus monkeys have addition- ally been used as experimental models for the study of protein andor energy malnutrition in a protein-restricted malnutrition 7 protein mouse model there was no significant change in villous height compared to normally fed controls however with increased severity of protein restriction to 5 or even 2 morphologic changes mimic what is seen in human intestinal biopsies with a reduction in villous height villous number and villous height-to-crypt depth ratio the addition of a secondary bacterial insult in the 7 protein-fed mice which provoked a phenotype comparable to that of a more severe protein restriction illustrated the interaction between gut microbes and dietary-induced intestinal changes intestinal epithelial barrier function is impaired by malnutrition alone and worsened by additional toxic injurythe most commonly used tests in animal models for measur- ing intestinal permeability are the fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc-dextran test which measures epithelial permeability via serum fitc concentrations as a method in vivo or the ussing chamber which measures transmural resistance via the flow of ions across the intestinal wall ex vivo increased intestinal per- meability as measured by an ussing chamber has been demon- strated in several animal models of malnutrition including guinea pigs 7 protein diet and neonatal piglets half-strength vs standard formula.

this review will focus on known morphologic and functional changes that is ''malnutrition entero- pathy'' of the intestine in moderate acute malnutrition to severe acute malnutrition sam respectively from both human studies and preclinical models.

hel- minths in particular may preferentially alter the intestinal bacterial flora to promote regulatory t-cell activation this mechanism is impaired at baseline in malnutrition helminths' immune- quieting effect has been employed in human and animal models for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and underscores the import- ance of the elucidation of inflammation and intestinal pathology inrelation to environmental modifiers animal models of malnutrition indicate a spectrum of phenotypic characteristicsin murine models of malnutrition various dietary combi- nations and species have been used resulting in a spectrum of intestinal changes with variations in the selection of diet sex and species.

one possible mechanism could be a loss of differentiation of regenerating cells into goblet cells coupled with an impairment of cellular migration of any new goblet cells toward the villus the findings of dock- nascimento et al of restoration of colonic goblet cells with the therapeutic addition of probiotics streptococcus thermophilus and l helveticus to a hydrolyzed diet of rats compared to a hydrolyzed diet without probiotics points to possible influences of bacterial populations in increasing goblet cell growth malnutrition and the stem cell nichepaneth cells reside in the deep intestinal crypts and are responsible for secreting antimicrobial peptides such as lysozymes and defensins to protect stem cells and aid in host defense against pathogens.

more mechanistic studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of malnutrition-related intestinal dysfunction and to identify potential novel targets for intervention.key words enteropathy environmental enteric dysfunction intestinal inflammation maternal and child health severe acute malnutritionjpgn 201765 491-495ndernutrition contributes to up to 45 of all deaths in children younger than 5 years the most severe formsof malnutrition are treated in-hospital with mortality rates of up to 30 although severe malnutrition was first scientifically described in 1933 its pathophysiology remains poorly under- stood.

saran et al have shown improved weight and height and reduced diarrheal episodes in impoverished children supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus this benefit has not yet translated to clinical effects on children with sam.

in addition mild to moderate energy restriction hasbeen shown to be associated with health benefits and in published preclinical models of malnutrition it is often unclear to what extent they reflect the severe malnutrition of children.

in mice with a relatively mild energy restriction 60 calories for 28 weeks yilmaz et al found a 1.5-fold increase in paneth cells this was accompanied by increased primitive intestinal stem cell expression .

in mice fed 2 protein bolick et al observed transiently increased lgr5 intestinal stem cell activity.

in a model of glutamine-deprived intestinal enteroids moore et al have also demonstrated the effect of glutamine on reactivating mtor- dependent crypt proliferation.
