SFB also boosted the Th17 response when mice received KRN T cells but not Rorc--.KRN T cells despite their SFB status D. These results suggested that gut microbiota SFB were able to induce sufficient Th17 cells to cause iBALT-like pathogenesis.Th17 Cells of Gut-Lung Axis Carry the Crosstalk between Gut Microbiota and LungBased on the common mucosal immune system CMIS whereby immune cells activated at one mucosal site home to other mucosal tissues via shared homing receptors   we hypothesized that the mucosal gut- lung axis provides a communication interface allowing SFB to transfer the initial autoimmune signal from the gut to the lung via SFB-induced Th17 cells.

Rather our data suggest that the increase in Th17 cells in the lung of SFB compared to SFB- KBxN mice is due to a larger SFB-induced gut Th17 cell pool and thus a higher number of gut Th17 cells recruited to the lung in SFB mice.At the molecular level we demonstrate that SFB selectively expand autoimmune T cells co-expressing SFB-specific TCRs in addition to their self-reactive TCRs.

Thus SFB pro- mote an autoreactive Th17 response by preferentially expanding Vb6 KRN T cells that co-express a second TCR Vb14 known to preferentially recognize SFB.To address whether this second TCR Vb14 on KRN T cells truly recognizes SFB we isolated both TCR Vb6Vb14 and TCR Vb6Vb14- populations from SFB KBxN mice and re-stimu- lated them with SFB peptide A6  plus DCs isolated from Tcra--.B6 mice.

Studies reported a preferential recruitment of Th17 cells to inflamed joints central nervous sys-Th17 cells in the SFB intestine and suggest that these cells were later recruited to the lung by CCL20 independent of SFB status.Gut Microbiota Trigger Autoimmunity by Expanding Th17 Cells Co-expressing Microbiota- and Self-Antigen- Specific TCRsTh17 cells predominantly use TCR Vb14 to recognize SFB pep- tide in B6 MHC class II H-2b mice .

Quantitative data showing the percentage of skewed Vb6Vb14 usage are calculated by dividing the percentage of Vb6Vb14 Th17 cells by the total Vb6 both Vb6Vb14- and Vb6Vb14 Th17 cells similar calculations were applied to non-Th17 cells n  10-12group four assays combined.SFB increase the percentage of dual TCR Vb6Vb14 cells among total TCR Vb6 cells in proliferated EdU lung Th17 but not non-Th17 cells n  11-12 group three assays combined.IL-17A ELISPOT assay of both Vb6Vb14- and Vb6Vb14 lung CD4 T cell populations from SFB KBxN mice treated with N3 peptide negative control SFB A6 peptide or anti-CD3 positive control.
