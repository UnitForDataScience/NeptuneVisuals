assessment for sibo among donors whether through breath testing or small bowel aspirates is also not traditionally performed.in this study we aimed to determine the role of sibo testing in pre-fmt screening by evaluating the relationship between the pre-fmt sibo status of both recipients and donors on lactulose breath testing lbt and post-fmt gas- trointestinal symptoms.materials and methodsthis was a prospective pilot study of consecutive adult patients from an academic medical center who underwent fmt for recurrent cdi by colonoscopy with a patient- selected donor e.g.

among the 20 fmts performed three patients 15 were confirmed totable 1 baseline characteristics of fmt recipients and donorsrecipientsn  20pre-lbt positiven  4pre-lbt negativen  16donorsn  20lbt positiven  6lbt negativen  14female4 100.013 81.23 507 50ti3 75.011 68.7--age66.7 - 18.756.2 - 19.043 - 19.143.6 - 11.1ibd1 25.03 18.70 00 0recurrence3.7 - .53.9 - 1.1--bmi22.2 - 20.126.1 - 23.929.8 - 4.730.1 - 7.1outpatient4 10016 100--table 2 prevalence of lbt positivity and clinical predictors with and without post-fmt gi symptomsgi symptomsn  5rencehave cdi recurrence while five 25 experienced at least one gi symptom post-fmt after cdi recurrence was ruled out.

based on our results and the well- documented limitations of lbt routine pre-fmt lbt in recipients does not appear to be indicated and at this point should not be recommended.although a statistically significant relationship was not found between donors' positive lbt testing and post-fmt outcomes a trend toward more post-fmt gi symptoms such as bloating diarrhea and constipation was observed among patients who received fmt from lbt-positivedonors.

all patients discontinued anti-cdi therapy 24-48 h prior to fmt and those who underwent colonoscopy took a standard bowel preparation.all patients were assessed at 8 weeks after fmt for both the presence of gi symptoms abdominal discomfort bloat- ing loose stools constipation and signs of cdi recurrence as per standard of care.

in this data set we found that recipients who had a posi- tive pre-fmt lbt did not have worse post-fmt outcomes including cdi recurrence or gi symptoms compared to those with normal lbt.

at 8 weeks post-fmt 17 85 recipients had cdi resolution and five 25 reported gi symptoms.

pre-fmt lbt result was not associated with post-fmt cdi resolution or gi symptoms.

intestinal dysmotility most notably rapid transit is common among patients with gi tract infections such as cdi.

routine pre-fmt screening and baseline lactulose breath tests lbts were performed for donors and recipients.
