in particular these researchers have found bi-directional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota denominated the microbiota-gut-brain axis -.although the molecular mechanisms by which the gut microbiota communicate with the brain are not yet clear the link between both components is currently attributed to immune signals and the vagus nerve.

on the brain-gut axis have been reported .this review summarizes current knowledge on the influence of the establishment of the gut microbiota in critical neurodevelopmental windows and discusses recent findings on the interactions between the gut microbiota and the host's brain-gut axis communications.

finally recommendations for future research on this topic are also discussed.establishment of intestinal microbiota during early neurodevelopmental windowsgut microbiota establish a beneficial cohabitation with the host that will prime for health later in life .

moreover breastfeeding has an additional role in the establishment of an infant's gut microbiota since it contains bioactive molecules that are increasingly recognized as drivers of microbiota development and overall gut health .

together with the results discussed in the previous section these findings open an intriguing question on the mechanism by which a mother's gut microbiota cooperate in regulating bbb integrity and ultimately brain function development.gut microbiota have direct effects on the immune system which constitutes another route of communication between gut microbes and the brain.
