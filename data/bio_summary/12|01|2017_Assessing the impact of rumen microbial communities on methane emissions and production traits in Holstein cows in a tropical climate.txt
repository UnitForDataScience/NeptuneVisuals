the rela- tive abundance of firmicutes varied largely among the production groups but the relative abundances of bacteroidetes did not dif- fer between groups kruskal-wallis p  0.05. dc cows had a greater relative abundance of methanobrevibacter 95.75 1.89 and lower abundance of methanosphaera 3.01 1.47 than hp cows 90.04 3.84 7.79 3.81 respectively kruskal-wallis p  0.05. the relative abundances of the main fungal genera were similar between production groups kruskal-wallis p  0.05.correlation between bacterial archaeal and anaerobic fungal taxa and physiological traitsthe strongest negative correlations found between ch4 emis- sions and bacteria were for sequences belonging to the family coriobacteriaceae r  0.86 spearman's test p  0.01 as well as the genera butyrivibrio r  0.65 spearman's test p  0.01 and schwartzia r  0.62 spearman's test p  0.01 table s10.

high-producing cows hp and dry cows dc had similar emission levels but they were less than mp cows and low-producing cows lp tukeyhsd p  0.05. when ch4 emissions were corrected for digestible dry matter intake ddmi and digestible organic matter intake domi table s4 dc had the highest ch4 emissions tukeyhsd p  0.05 followed by mp and hplp cows.

for example cheaper more fibrous diets fed to dry and low-milk producing cows lead to more residual hydrogen because of the greater amounts of acetate produced while more expensive high-milk producing diets based on high starch content induce a greater production of propionate thereby lowering the produc- tion of hydrogen and methane in the rumen differences in methane production due to diet are further impacted by climate and geography as forages in tropical conditions often present lower digestibility and their degradation in the rumen results in a higher proportion of acetate and methane thus adjusted methane mitigation practices may be necessary for animals with different production levels fed different diets in different environments.the composition of the rumen microbial community is alsothought to contribute significantly to methane production.

the richness and diversity of the archaeal and anaerobic fungal communities were similar between groups anova p  0.05.physiological and production traits were significant in cluster- ing animals only in the bacterial and anaerobic fungal communities cows were observed to have similar bacterial community composition jaccard anosim p  0.58 but different bacterial com- munity structure bray-curtis anosim p  0.02 table s6.

there are a number of studies that have focused on the relationship between methane emissions and the rumen bacterial or archaeal microbiota since these communities contribute directly to hydro- gen or methane production in the rumen however there is little information regarding how the overall community of bacte- ria archaea and fungi in the same animal contributes to methane emissions and this knowledge could be used to modulate methane emissions through manipulation of the ruminal microbiota.

indeed it was observed that among cows that diverged the most in relation to ch4 emission hp versus dc butyrate concentrations were greater for hp cows  which also emitted less ch4 than dc cows.

overall dc cows emitted more methane followed by mp hp and lp cows although hp and lp cow emissions were similar.
