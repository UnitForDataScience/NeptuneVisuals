For example cheaper more fibrous diets fed to dry and low-milk producing cows lead to more residual hydrogen because of the greater amounts of acetate produced while more expensive high-milk producing diets based on high starch content induce a greater production of propionate thereby lowering the produc- tion of hydrogen and methane in the rumen Differences in methane production due to diet are further impacted by climate and geography as forages in tropical conditions often present lower digestibility and their degradation in the rumen results in a higher proportion of acetate and methane Thus adjusted methane mitigation practices may be necessary for animals with different production levels fed different diets in different environments.The composition of the rumen microbial community is alsothought to contribute significantly to methane production.

The forageconcentrate ratios were 5050 for HP cows 7030 for the MP cows 8020 for LP cows and 9010 for DC cows.

High-producing cows HP and dry cows DC had similar emission levels but they were less than MP cows and low-producing cows LP TukeyHSD P  0.05.

When comparing the dDMI and dOMI HP and MP cows were similar TukeyHSD P  0.10 but higher than LP and DC cows TukeyHSD P  0.05 and Table S4.VFA concentrations in rumen fluid and Table S4 were lower for LP TukeyHSD P  0.05 cows and HP cows had the highest propionate concentration TukeyHSD P  0.05 which led to a lower acetatepropionate ratio TukeyHSD P  0.05.Rumen liquid fraction microbiota characterizationAfter all filtering analyses the number of sequences obtained was 214676 for bacteria mean  11298 5109 64774 for archaea mean  3409 1555 and 12544 for anaerobic fungi mean  660 505.

There are a number of studies that have focused on the relationship between methane emissions and the rumen bacterial or archaeal microbiota since these communities contribute directly to hydro- gen or methane production in the rumen However there is little information regarding how the overall community of bacte- ria archaea and fungi in the same animal contributes to methane emissions and this knowledge could be used to modulate methane emissions through manipulation of the ruminal microbiota.

Indeed it was observed that among cows that diverged the most in relation to CH4 emission HP versus DC butyrate concentrations were greater for HP cows  which also emitted less CH4 than DC cows.

Overall DC cows emitted more methane followed by MP HP and LP cows although HP and LP cow emissions were similar.
