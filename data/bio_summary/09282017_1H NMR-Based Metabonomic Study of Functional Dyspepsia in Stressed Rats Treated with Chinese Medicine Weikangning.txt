according to the kegg metabolism network two of them citrate cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism belong to carbohydrate metabolism one glycerolipid metabolism belongs to lipid metabolism and five of them phenylalanine metabolism phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosyn- thesis valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis tyrosine metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism are in the range of amino acid metabolism.

however six potential target pathways glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosyn- thesis glycine serine and threonine metabolism phenylala- nine metabolism valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism were identified during the period of drug treatment  table s2.

furthermore because formate can be converted from methanol through formaldehyde primarily by alcohol dehydrogenases and can also be produced by gut microbiota 63 the increased levels of formate in urine and decreased levels in serum in the wkn group may reflect the intervention effects on gut microbiota and metabolic clear- ance mechanisms that are involved in wkn's effects in fd.the disturbances of energy metabolism stress-related metabolism and gut microbiota in stressed fd model rats mentioned above are generally consistent with the previous findings of metabolic profiling in human subjects with high anxiety trait 64. our observations also suggest the potential beneficial effects of wkn in fd for improving the conditions of diet intestinal microbiota and mental health which may relate to the regulation of the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

according to these parameters there were six poten- tial target pathways phenylalanine tyrosine and trypto- phan biosynthesis citrate cycle tca cycle or krebs cycle phenylalanine metabolism valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and tyrosine metabolism found to be active in the period of model establishment table s1.

according to the key metabolites determined by opls- da alterations in energy metabolism stress-related metabolism and gut microbiota were found in fd model rats after stress stim- ulation and these alterations were restored to normal after wkn administration.

given that carbohydrate lipids and proteins are the three basic energy substances their metabolism is closely associated with energy metabolism and the citrate cycle tca cycle or krebs cycle and their shared metabolic pathways play an important and crucial role in the energy metabolic network 31. in fd modeling decreased levels of glucose acetate and citrate cycle products citrate 2-oxoglutarate and succinate and increased levels of amino acids leucine isoleucine tyrosine phenylalanine alanine and proline indicate a high demand for and rapid utilization of metabolites to fulfill energy producing pathways in accordance with the reduced food intake of the ms group  .

the current observations in both urine and serum samples indicate that the disorder of energy metabolism stress- related metabolism and gut microbiota was caused by stress stimulation in fd model rats and this condition was restored to normal after wkn administration.

disturbed energy metabolism is also reflected in the high levels of lactate as a result of accelerated glycolysis to feed the energy demand of increased exercise in the fd model rats to escape from tail stimulation 34. the results differ slightly from an observation of higher levels of proline and lower levels of -glucose lactate and leucineisoleucine in fd patients compared with those of healthy control presented in a recent clinical study based21.510.50-0.5-1-1.5-4 -3 -2 -101234pc1 59.12218141062-2-6-10-14-18-22t1302520151050-5-10-15-20ms ns wkna80006000400020000-2000-4000-6000-8000ms ns wknb0.80.70.60.50.40.30.20.10-25-3087654321chemical shift ppmms ns35302520151050-5-10-15-20-25ct1400020000-2000-4000-6000-8000d8765432 10.80.70.60.50.40.30.20.10-30-35chemical shift ppmms wknet1ftreatment performing discrimination2between ms 2black squares ns2 red dots and wkn blue diamonds   59.1  11.5and wkn groups blue diamonds   15.1  78.0 and  5.5 c opls-da score plot of model group ms a2nd normal 99.2 and  28.9 d opls-da corresponding color-coded correlation coefficient loading plot of key metabolites based on thems black squares and wkn groups blue diamonds   20.1  97.6 and  37.2 f opls-da corresponding color-codedchemicalintegral in msintegral in ns bcmetabolitesshiftgroupa mea-n2 -groupa mea-n2 -corrcorr0.632vipp  0.05leucine0.96 dd0.220 - 0.043d0.193 - 0.019d0.693 2.3680.010dcthe p values were obtained from independent-samples t-test or -test shown with c. dthe p values were calculated by mann-whitney u test of nonparametric tests and the related integrals were presented inintegral in wkn groupaintegral in ms groupa bcmetaboliteschemical shiftmean - s.d.

additionally the negative psychosocial impacts of the condition greatly lower the quality of life of fd patients as demonstrated by the high comorbidity with anxiety and depression 33-77. in the meantime recent pathophysiological studies have increased new insights into the pathogenesis of fd .in this present work we adopted stressed rat model via tail damping to established fd model which was verifiedchemicalintegral in ms groupaintegral in ns groupa bcmetabolitesshiftmean - s.d.

all animals were acclimated to the conditions for five days and individual metabolism cages for 4 hours before any experimentation.a total of 30 rats were divided into two groups randomly 20 for the fd model group ms group and 10 for the normal control group ns group.

similarly our previous work demonstrated abnormal glycometabolism and lipid metabolism in upper gastrointestinal gi tract tissues of fd model rats due to insufficient energy supply as a consequence of the treatment of wkn our study detected a high level of glucose and low levels of krebs cycle products citrate and cis-aconitate amino acids alanine methionine glycine leucine phenylalanine glutamate and proline 2- hydroxyvalerate 3-hydroxybutyrate and glycerol indicating increased gluconeogenesis and decreased degradation of proteins and lipids with reduced glycolysis.

these outcomes reveal that energy metabolism is a ther- apeutic target of wkn and provide evidence of the improve- ment in the appetite of fd model rats treated by wkn.amino acids and stress-related metabolites.

this study may provide new insights into the rela- tionship between fd and psychological stress and assist in research into the metabolic mechanisms involved in chinese medicine.introductionfunctional dyspepsia fd is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders fgids.

it is defined according to the rome iii criteria as consisting of several upper gastrointestinal symptoms including epigastric pain or discomfort postprandial fullness and early satiety lasting for 6 months at least without any evidence of structural diseases that can explain symptoms the global prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia ud is 20.8 and the overall pooled prevalence of fd diagnosed by rome iii criteria is in the range of 4.6-11.3 the nature of fd is chronic and fluctuating and only 50 of patient with this disease experience a resolution of symptoms whereas 15-20 of patients' symptoms are persistent which lowers the quality of life and overall health also increasing psychological distress.
