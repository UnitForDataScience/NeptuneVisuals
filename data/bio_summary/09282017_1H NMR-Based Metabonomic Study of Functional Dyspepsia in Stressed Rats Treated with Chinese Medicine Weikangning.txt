According to the KEGG metabolism network two of them citrate cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism belong to carbohydrate metabolism one glycerolipid metabolism belongs to lipid metabolism and five of them phenylalanine metabolism phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosyn- thesis valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis tyrosine metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism are in the range of amino acid metabolism.

Glutamate as excitatory neurotransmitter glycine and alanine as inhibitory neurotransmitters are central players in the maintenance of normal brain function and the improvement of several neurological disorders 43- The branched-chain amino acids BCAAs including valine leucine and isoleucine in similar metabolic processes have been found to be involved in stress energy and muscle metabolism and also have neurophysiological therapeutic effects related to the competitive relationship with aromatic UpregulatedDownregulatedUpregulated in urine Downregulated in serumUnchangedFigure 8 Schematic diagram of the disturbed metabolic network detected by H NMR analysis showing the interrelationship of the identified metabolic pathways.

Furthermore because formate can be converted from methanol through formaldehyde primarily by alcohol dehydrogenases and can also be produced by gut microbiota 63 the increased levels of formate in urine and decreased levels in serum in the WKN group may reflect the intervention effects on gut microbiota and metabolic clear- ance mechanisms that are involved in WKN's effects in FD.The disturbances of energy metabolism stress-related metabolism and gut microbiota in stressed FD model rats mentioned above are generally consistent with the previous findings of metabolic profiling in human subjects with high anxiety trait 64.

Given that carbohydrate lipids and proteins are the three basic energy substances their metabolism is closely associated with energy metabolism and the citrate cycle TCA cycle or Krebs cycle and their shared metabolic pathways play an important and crucial role in the energy metabolic network 31.

It is defined according to the Rome III criteria as consisting of several upper gastrointestinal symptoms including epigastric pain or discomfort postprandial fullness and early satiety lasting for 6 months at least without any evidence of structural diseases that can explain symptoms The global prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia UD is 20.8 and the overall pooled prevalence of FD diagnosed by Rome III criteria is in the range of 4.6-11.3 The nature of FD is chronic and fluctuating and only 50 of patient with this disease experience a resolution of symptoms whereas 15-20 of patients' symptoms are persistent which lowers the quality of life and overall health also increasing psychological distress.

The current observations in both urine and serum samples indicate that the disorder of energy metabolism stress- related metabolism and gut microbiota was caused by stress stimulation in FD model rats and this condition was restored to normal after WKN administration.

However six potential target pathways glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosyn- thesis glycine serine and threonine metabolism phenylala- nine metabolism valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism were identified during the period of drug treatment  Table S2.

According tothe signal variability of H NMR the PCA model was first established to detect the separation between groups basedpresented as days 11 14 18 and 21 in predose stage there were 20group.variance separately  59.1  11.5.rats in MS group black squares whereas in postdose stage therewere 9 rats respectively in MS red dots and WKN green trianglesAccording to metabolic trajectory analysis of the urine metabolic information of the MS group on predose day 4 was further away from normal conditions predose day 1 than that on predose day 7 and similarly the metabolic information of the WKN group on postdose day 11 was nearest to that of the normal conditions than others.

The metabolicon serum metabolic information and the score plot of PCAwas acquired with the first two PCs showing 59.1 and 11.5To strengthen the ability of separation as the partial overlaps in the PCA score plot between the three groups a PLS- DA model was constructed to evaluate the relative metabolic differences on postdose day 14 and exhibited good ability to discriminate between the MS NS and WKN groups shown in the relative score plot in To detect the key metabolites playing important roles in the separation between groups from serum samples after administration OPLS-DA models were established between the MS NS and WKN groups using the first principal and second orthogonal components.
