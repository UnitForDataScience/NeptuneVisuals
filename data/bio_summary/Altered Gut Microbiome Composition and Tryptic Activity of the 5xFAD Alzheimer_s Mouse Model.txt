1C p  0.535 for male wild type versus 5xFAD all other p  0.999.Decrease in fecal trypsin amount in early pathological stages of 5xFAD miceDifficulties in gaining weight could be caused by reduced food intake as well as by hyperactivity ofFig.

Both enzymatic activities were indistinguishable between 5xFAD male mice and wild type littermates at the age of nine weeks.Potential role of ENS-derived Ab in trypsin deficiencyThe transgenes in the 5xFAD mice Al3PP PS1 are under control of the Thy1 promoter 28.Fig.

Nev- ertheless no change in trypsin activity and trypsin production in pancreatic tissue from the 5xFAD mice could be observed.

Heat- inactivated trypsin or trypsin pretreated for 5 min with trypsin inhibitor 30 ugml Sigma-Aldrich Stein- heim Germany served as negative controls.Analysis of the fecal microbiotaFecal samples were sent for microbiological analysis to the MVZ Institut fur Mikrookologie Herborn Germany.

The arrow indicates unbound trypsin left bovine trypsin right porcine trypsin.

As negative controls a heat-denatured trypsin sample h and trypsin pre-treated with trypsin inhibitor ti were used.

Exact n-numbers of each group are given in Supple- mentary Table 1.Genotyping was performed using the primers 5xFAD for GTAGCAGAGGAGGAAGAAGTG and 5xFAD rev CATGACCTGGGACATTCTC asdescribed before 29.

Values of p  0.05 were considered statis- tically significant.RESULTSTransient body weight reduction in male 5xFAD miceOnset of Al3 production has been described in 5xFAD mice as early as at the age of 1.5 months 28.Therefore first pathological effects can be expected at this young adult stage.
