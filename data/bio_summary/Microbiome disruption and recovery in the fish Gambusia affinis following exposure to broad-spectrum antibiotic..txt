Disruption of community biochemical activities may therefore better reflect microbiome dysfunction than taxonomic changes.12 Accordingly biochemical tests were used to examine the pathways that were phenotypically active in the whole microbiome consortium before and after antibiotic exposure.As expected for a complex community the skin micro- biome extracted before treatment was biochemically active with 23 of 31 tests being positive Table 1.

Although host-derived enzymes in the skin mucus could potentially cause false positive results in these systems it is unlikely since these enzymes would be at very low concentrations compared to the bacterial enzymes in this culture-based system.To further examine the phenotypical properties of the skin microbiome consortium following antibiotic exposure the susceptibility profile of the consortium was determinedFigure 2 Wild-type skin microbiome composition.Massilia 21.2Canditatus Captivus1 19.7Rickettsia 6.0Leptothrix 5.7Ottowia 5.2Candidatus Captivus2 3.8Variovorax 2.1FukuN18 1.8Novosphingobium 1.8B 1.6LD28 1.4Other 29.6Notes Average percent normalized abundance of the top 11 taxa from skin of four control fish shown at the genus level.

Although the microbiome wassensitive at the same level both before and after rifampicin selection against sulfisoxazole at least some resistance to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was selected.The many susceptibility changes strongly suggest that a major change in the microbiome composition is caused by rifampicin selection.

Fish from the same aquarium have very similar skin microbiome compositions.Fish skin fish gut and lake water microbiome communi- ties contain mostly the same families but at strongly different abundances Figure 3.

Captivus is uncultured and has unknown oxygen requirements.A previous study on the Gambusia skin microbiome suggested that this mucosal surface may be selective not simply a passive recipient of bacteria from the water col- umn.6 The differences in community composition between the skin and water observed in this study Figure 3 support this conclusion.Disruption of the fish skin microbiome by rifampicin results in only a transient 38.5 h loss of culturable bac- teria however drug-resistant bacteria are rapidly selected for and persist for at least 2 weeks following the removal of antibiotic.

It should be noted that in a recent study on rainbow trout about 50 of the microbiome community diversity was present within the skin epitheliumso this may be serving as a major reservoir to reseed the mucosa and was not examined in this study.19Rifampicin-resistant organisms are likely present at low levels in the Gambusia skin microbiome the detection limitAPC2 12BPC2 15Untreated skinTreated skin Recovered skinUntreated gut Treated gut Recovered gutPC1 32PC1 32An interesting result in this study was the loss of Rickett- sia from the fish.

The controllable vertebrate model used in this study is now being used to investigate the effects on the host organism resulting from significant antibiotic-induced microbiome community changes2425 and driving factors during the recovery of the microbiome after antibiotic stress.

As observed via culture viable counts from the skin microbiome dropped strongly yet returned to pretreatment levels by 1.6 days and became 70 resistant.

The gut microbiome counts dropped and took longer to recover 2.6 days and became 90 drug resistant.

The antibiotic lowered the skin and gut microbiome community diversity and altered taxonomic composition observed by 16S rRNA profiling.
