climate but is also influenced to some extent by plant host genotype Relative to bulk soil a rhizo- sphere effect results in a plant-root-associated microbial community that is more numerous and shows greater metabolic activity that is shaped by exudation of carbon and other metabolites from the plant root Thus mu- tations in genes related to plant nutrient metabolism may in turn influence the rhizosphere microbial commu- nity with implications for plant growth and health Furthermore manipulation of host-associated microbial communities is receiving increasing attention as a bio- logical mechanism to improve plant growth and stress resistance Important to the determination of what constitutes a beneficial microbial community is the characterization of how diverse soil bacteria interact with host plant spe- cies The rhizosphere effect that exerts some control on the rhizosphere community composition is mediated by metabolic exchange between the roots and soil The partitioning of nutrients to the roots and their exchange with the soil environment is controlled by the response of plants to environmental signals such as light and temperature These responses are modulated by a plant's innate ability to estimate time within an ap- proximately 24-h period and synchronize biological events via the circadian clock The importance of light in shaping the outcome of host-microbe interac- tions is becoming increasingly evident.

Taken together these results suggest that while beta diversity changed in both the rhizosphere and fallow soil between dark and light samples only rhizo- sphere communities and not those in soil showed a sig- nificant change in phylobetadiversity despite a greater percentage of community variation in soil.SOM characterization of AM and PM rhizosphere organic matterThe SOM composition was significantly different in the water fraction of rhizosphere samples between the dark AM and light PM samples Fig.

Alpha diver- sity among samples from the wild-type rhizosphere by both Shannon and ACE indices was significantly greater P  0.018 and 0.024 during dark periods 1 am and 7 am samples compared to when samples were exposed to light or shortly thereafter 1 pm and 7 pm samples Table This apparent discrepancy from the earlier AMPM experiment may reflect greater statistical power in this experiment due to a greater number of samples collected 9-10 compared to 17 in dark and light groups or slight differences in the times when samples were collected relative to the photoperiod.

Similarly phylogenetic differences in com- munity composition phylobetadiversity described further in the  section assessed using unweighted UniFrac distances showed significant dif- ferences P  0.031 between the dark and lightcommunities in the rhizosphere but not in soil alone P  0.217 suggesting changes in the soil were evolu- tionary driven.Community compositions beta diversity between dark and light samples were significantly different in both environments P  0.018 and 0.031 for rhizosphere and soil communities respectively as evaluated by ana- lysis of similarity ANOSIM but as stated above phylo- betadiversity did not differ in fallow soil.

Three experiments were conducted 1 a biological replicate experiment in which A. thaliana or fallow soil n  10 for each was collected 1 h prior to light expos- ure AM and 1 h prior to turning off the lights PM with a 9-h photoperiod 9 am-6 pm 2 a 72-h cycling experiment in which wild-type Arabidopsis the acc1- ox34 OX34 acyclic mutant strain of Arabidopsis or fallow soil was grown with a 9-h light period 9 am-6 pm and harvested in triplicate every 6 h 7 am 1 pm 7 pm and 1 am for 72 h and 3 a 72-h B. distach- yon BD21 experiment that employed the same sampling regime as experiment 2 except using Brachypodium and fallow soil with a 12-h light period 8 am-8 pm.

The increase inthe abundance of lipid-like compounds in the dark sam- ples compared to the light samples was significant and primarily drove the separation between the dark and light in methanol extracts Additional file Figure S5.The average mass-to-charge ratio mz range of the compounds identified in AM samples was lower than that in the PM samples where the PM samples appeared to have significantly higher mz values.

Planctomycetaceae was the most abundant family in both environments at both time points Additional file Figure S2 and about a quarter of the community 23.3 - 2.3 and 28.5 - 4.7 of sequence reads in rhizosphere and soil samples respect- ively could not be classified to a family.Principal coordinate analysis of Bray-Curtis distances revealed significant separation AMOVA Fs  1.28 P  0.003 of dark AM communities from those character- ized from light PM samples in the Arabidopsis rhizo- sphere Additional file  Figure S3.

Mutant rhizosphere and soil com- munities showed greater variation independent of cycling than wild-type rhizosphere communities yet a smallerproportion of the community showed significant cycling dynamics by the JTK algorithm suggesting that variation in mutant rhizosphere and soil samples is likely stochastic rather than cyclical.

The microbial community in the OX34 rhizosphere and fallow soil showed greater amounts of variability independent of cycling by Kruskal-Wallis test with 25 of the community varying in the mutant rhizosphere and 30-35 vary- ing in soil alone.

While differences in alpha diversity measured as Shannon diversity and abundance-based coverage esti- mate ACE of richness did not significantly differ be- tween dark and light samples 9 h between time points for a given host environment Table Shannon diver- sity was significantly greater in rhizosphere samples versus fallow soil P  0.001.
