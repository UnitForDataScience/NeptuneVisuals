climate but is also influenced to some extent by plant host genotype relative to bulk soil a rhizo- sphere effect results in a plant-root-associated microbial community that is more numerous and shows greater metabolic activity that is shaped by exudation of carbon and other metabolites from the plant root thus mu- tations in genes related to plant nutrient metabolism may in turn influence the rhizosphere microbial commu- nity with implications for plant growth and health furthermore manipulation of host-associated microbial communities is receiving increasing attention as a bio- logical mechanism to improve plant growth and stress resistance important to the determination of what constitutes a beneficial microbial community is the characterization of how diverse soil bacteria interact with host plant spe- cies the rhizosphere effect that exerts some control on the rhizosphere community composition is mediated by metabolic exchange between the roots and soil the partitioning of nutrients to the roots and their exchange with the soil environment is controlled by the response of plants to environmental signals such as light and temperature these responses are modulated by a plant's innate ability to estimate time within an ap- proximately 24-h period and synchronize biological events via the circadian clock the importance of light in shaping the outcome of host-microbe interac- tions is becoming increasingly evident.

alpha diver- sity among samples from the wild-type rhizosphere by both shannon and ace indices was significantly greater p  0.018 and 0.024 during dark periods 1 am and 7 am samples compared to when samples were exposed to light or shortly thereafter 1 pm and 7 pm samples table this apparent discrepancy from the earlier ampm experiment may reflect greater statistical power in this experiment due to a greater number of samples collected 9-10 compared to 17 in dark and light groups or slight differences in the times when samples were collected relative to the photoperiod.

recent studies show that the intestinal microbiota of humans and mice  undergo diurnal oscillations under the control of host feeding time and diet and silencing of a host's molecular clock genes causes gut dysbiosis the circadian clock is an important regulator of numerous basic plant functions including central carbon metabolism gene expression stomatal function and the timing component of photoperiodism which regu- lates seasonal reproduction the clock is also subject to extensive natural variation both within and between species and this is reported to influence plant fitness and performance - as a result the circadian clock is considered a key regulator of plant physiology and adaptation to different geographic envi- ronments enabling an organism to anticipate periodic environmental changes and adapt its physiological and developmental states accordingly indeed the life cycles of pathogens are closely associated with diurnally regulated host plant metabolism and the circadian clock has been suggested to contribute to enhanced plantfitness by balancing innate immune responses with cellular metabolism in arabidopsis the circadian clock consists of a series of intertwined feedback loops regulated both trans- criptionally and post-transcriptionally through post- translational modification and protein turnover this mechanism appears to be conserved across plant species the circadian clock has been found to influence a variety of metabolic functions in the plant including chlorophyll biosynthesis transport photosystems starch synthesis and degradation and nitrogen and sulfur assimilation the concentrations of metabolites in- cluding nitrate glutamate glutamine and sucrose have also been shown to alter clock timing however due to differences in methodology these results are sometimes inconsistent across studies highlighting a need to consider photoperiod duration and the time of sample collection when describing results while the circadian clock machinery and associated metabolic and physiological responses have been well characterized especially in arabidopsis  little is known about how the rhizosphere bacterial community responds to host circadian cycling.

the majority of these compounds contained only c h and o. the increase inthe abundance of lipid-like compounds in the dark sam- ples compared to the light samples was significant and primarily drove the separation between the dark and light in methanol extracts additional file figure s5.the average mass-to-charge ratio mz range of the compounds identified in am samples was lower than that in the pm samples where the pm samples appeared to have significantly higher mz values.

taken together these results suggest that while beta diversity changed in both the rhizosphere and fallow soil between dark and light samples only rhizo- sphere communities and not those in soil showed a sig- nificant change in phylobetadiversity despite a greater percentage of community variation in soil.som characterization of am and pm rhizosphere organic matterthe som composition was significantly different in the water fraction of rhizosphere samples between the dark am and light pm samples fig.

ordination of chemical compounds by principal compo- nents analysis pca additional file figure s4 panel a and figure s5 panel a revealed that dark and the light samples were mainly separated along pc1 whereas the different biological and technical replicates within each cluster were separated along pc2.the organic compounds responsible for such separ- ation were extracted from the loading plots and plotted on a van krevelen diagram additional file figure s4table 1 coverage and alpha diversity mean - standard deviation among am and pm rhizosphere samples based on 16s rrna gene sequencingvalues sharing the same capital letter subscripts did not differ significantly by tukey's post-hoc test p  0.05asobs number of otus observedbindices sharing the same superscript did not differ significantly by tukey's post hoc test p  0.05panel b and figure s5 panel b. the majority of the compounds present in the light samples had high oxygencarbon oc ratios that fell in the aromatic-like lignin-like and tannin-like region of the van krevelen diagram and represent potential alkaloids ketones terpenoids flavonoids organic acids and condensed tannins.

while differences in alpha diversity measured as shannon diversity and abundance-based coverage esti- mate ace of richness did not significantly differ be- tween dark and light samples 9 h between time points for a given host environment table shannon diver- sity was significantly greater in rhizosphere samples versus fallow soil p  0.001. samples had similar taxo- nomic compositions and were predominantly comprised of members of the proteobacteria actinobacteria and acidobacteria additional file figure s1.

microbial regulation of host genes has been ob- served in rhizobial-legume interactions and in the euprymna scolopes squid in which vibrio fischeri bio- luminescence regulates expression of a host crypto- chrome similarly the gut microbiota regulates rhythmic signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells that coordinate glucocorticoid production in the intes- tine and the bacterial community is responsible for normal clock functioning in the liver and hypothal- amus in mice several groups have begun investigat- ing how rhizosphere and endophytic communities might be used to improve plant biomass and stress resistance and future studies in arabidopsis are necessary to understand how the microbiota influences host plant circadian functioning and productivity.conclusionsthe extent of change of the rhizosphere microbiota over a 24-h period equals or exceeds those previously attrib- uted to factors such as plant genotype - while current hypotheses suggest that microbial populations in the rhizosphere are relatively static and primarily related to soil communities  our work suggests other- wise.

planctomycetaceae was the most abundant family in both environments at both time points additional file figure s2 and about a quarter of the community 23.3 - 2.3 and 28.5 - 4.7 of sequence reads in rhizosphere and soil samples respect- ively could not be classified to a family.principal coordinate analysis of bray-curtis distances revealed significant separation amova fs  1.28 p  0.003 of dark am communities from those character- ized from light pm samples in the arabidopsis rhizo- sphere additional file  figure s3.

approximately two-fold formula-assigned compounds were more abun- dant among light samples compared to dark samples.

differences in alpha diversity between light and dark exposures were not significant among communities in the ox34 rhizo- sphere p  0.813. in soil alone differences in the shan- non index were also not significant p  0.091. in contrast ace richness was significantly greater among dark samples p  0.0001 which may reflect greater variation in soil over a longer time periods compared to single-time point ampm samples.

samples were collected during dark conditions 1 am 2 h before light 7 am during light exposure 1 pm and 1 h after dark 7 pm.

soil organic matter som compos- ition in the rhizosphere was also characterized by high- resolution mass spectrometry 21t fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr-ms to help elucidate microbial metabolism.in this study we assessed cycling dynamics 1 among biological replicates of a. thaliana sampled during dark and light periods to determine whether microbial com- munity composition changed due to a diel cycle associ- ated with exposure to light 2 over a 72-h period utilizing an acyclic arabidopsis line in which the cca1 gene is ectopically over-expressed  to determine differences in rhizosphere communities between the wild-type and mutant genotypes and 3 of rhizosphere communities of a second species brachypodium dis- tachyon to determine if this cycling phenomenon is conserved among physiologically diverse plant species.

three experiments were conducted 1 a biological replicate experiment in which a. thaliana or fallow soil n  10 for each was collected 1 h prior to light expos- ure am and 1 h prior to turning off the lights pm with a 9-h photoperiod 9 am-6 pm 2 a 72-h cycling experiment in which wild-type arabidopsis the acc1- ox34 ox34 acyclic mutant strain of arabidopsis or fallow soil was grown with a 9-h light period 9 am-6 pm and harvested in triplicate every 6 h 7 am 1 pm 7 pm and 1 am for 72 h and 3 a 72-h b. distach- yon bd21 experiment that employed the same sampling regime as experiment 2 except using brachypodium and fallow soil with a 12-h light period 8 am-8 pm.

differences in beta diversity were evaluated using analysis of similarity anosim phylobetadiversity was analyzed using unweighted unifrac distances and cluster analysis was performed using analysis of molecular variance amova using bray-curtis dissimilarity matrices in this study we used the terminology of graham and fine to define beta diversity as a change in the species composition between samples while phylobetadi- versity referred to a change in phylogenetic relatedness of communities.ordination of samples was performed via principal coordinate analysis.
