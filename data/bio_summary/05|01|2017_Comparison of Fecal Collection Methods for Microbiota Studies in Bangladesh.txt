these fecal collection methods are optimal for fu- ture cohort studies particularly in low- and middle-income countries.importance the collection of fecal samples in prospective cohort studies is es- sential to provide the opportunity to study the effect of the human microbiota on numerous health conditions.

for the different collection methods the primary source of variability was intersubject variability al- though some variability was related to the collection method particularly for weighted unifrac.

this suggests that it may be difficult to combine results using different collection methods and so future studies particu- larly those considering geographic differences in the microbiota should collect samples using at least one similar method for comparability.in general our findings agree with those from many of the previous studies considering the impact of the collection method and short-term storage at room temperature in predominantly western populations .

the lower accuracy measures may also limit the pooling of microbial data between different geographical regions if each study utilizes a unique collection method as each collection may have unique microbial artifacts.

figure s1 in the supplemental material demonstrates the strong clustering by subject regardless of collection method or freezing timepoint.to evaluate the percentages of microbial variability due to subject sample collection type and day of freezing we calculated a distance-based coefficient of determination r2 from beta diversity estimates i.e.
