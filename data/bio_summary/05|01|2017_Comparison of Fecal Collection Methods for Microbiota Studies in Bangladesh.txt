For example for day 0 samples the ICCs for the weighted UniFrac distance were 0.93 95 confidence interval CI 0.91 to 0.95 for no solution 0.91 95 CI 0.86 to 0.97 for the FIT tube 0.98 95 CI 0.97 to 0.98 for theFOBT card 0.97 95 CI 0.96 to 0.98 for RNAlater and 0.97 95 CI 0.95 to 0.98 foraIncludes 50 participants of the HEALS Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study.

Therefore we tested the technical reproducibility of five different fecal sample collection methods no solution 95 ethanol RNAlater postde- velopment fecal occult blood test FOBT cards and fecal immunochemical test FIT tubes the impact of delayed freezing on these collection methods and the accuracy of each method compared with that of a gold standard within the Health Effects ofArsenic Longitudinal Study HEALS in Bangladesh.Part of this work was presented at the International Human Microbiome Consor- tium Congress in Houston Texas 9 to 11 November 2016.RESULTSDescriptive characteristics.

For the Shannon index the Spearman correlations ranged from 0.60 95 CI0.41 to 0.79 for 95 ethanol to 0.71 95 CI 0.52 to 0.89 for the FOBT card in comparison to the gold standard bottom see also Table S6B.

These fecal collection methods are optimal for fu- ture cohort studies particularly in low- and middle-income countries.IMPORTANCE The collection of fecal samples in prospective cohort studies is es- sential to provide the opportunity to study the effect of the human microbiota on numerous health conditions.

Therefore new studies in low- and middle-income countries should in- clude collection of fecal samples using fecal occult blood test cards 95 ethanol or RNAlater for prospective cohort studies.May 2017 Volume 83 Issue 10 e00361-17Applied and Environmental Microbiology 1KEYWORDS feces lowmiddle-income countries microbiota sampling methods stabilityhe human microbiome has garnered increasing scientific interest over the past few years.

S5B and Table S3B samples.FIG 1 Mean technical reproducibility and 95 CIs from day 0 replicates A and day 4 replicates B for the relative abundance of three phyla two alpha diversity metrics and four beta diversity metrics by fecal sample collection method using intraclass correlation coefficients.

BC Bray-Curtis distance.FIG 2 Mean stability and 95 CIs by fecal sample collection methods i.e.

The fecal collection methods particularly the FOBT card and the preservation of samples in RNAlater and 95 ethanol had high ICCs for stability.

For the relative abundance of Actinobacteria the ICCs ranged from 0.90 95 CI 0.84 to 0.95 for the FIT tube to 0.98 95 CI 0.97 to 0.99 for the FOBT card.

However for the relative abundances of the other two phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes the ICCs for the FIT tube were lower with ICCs of 0.65 95 CI 0.49 to 0.82 and 0.20 95 CI 0.00 to 0.48 respectively.
