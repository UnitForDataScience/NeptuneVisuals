Thus the most represented phyla are Actinobacteria 37 genomes 9.3 of the analyzed genomes Bacteroidetes 69 genomes 17.3 Firmicutes 197 genomes 49.6 andProteobacteria 71 genomes 17.9.Approach Tools and DatabasesThe PubSEED platform was used to annotate the genes responsible for the degradation of mucin glycans using the following comparative genomics approach.

The most frequently observed problems are as follows1 the absence of known Gal transporters in 30 genomes mostly Firmicutes 2 the absence of L-fuculose phosphate aldolase in 23 genomes belonging to Bacteroidetes Clostridia and some Actinobacteria 3 the absence of L-fuculokinase in 19 genomes belonging to Bacteroidetes Clostridia and some Actinobacteria and 4 the absence of galactose kinase which was observed in 7 genomes of Firmicutes.

Additionally we predicted potential feeding pathways for mucin glycan-derived monosaccharides the specificity of various HGM strains for different types of mucin glycans and mutualistic relationships for the cleavage of mucin glycans by different HGM organisms.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnalyzed GenomesThe analyzed genomes were selected using the following steps.All genomes listed in the Human Microbiome Project HMP as of 17.09.2015 and 459 genomes with the body site Gastrointestinal tract i.e.

This transporter is highly distributed in the analyzed genomes co-clustering with the fuc genes in 88 genomes and with the fcl genes in 4 genomes.

This transporter was found in 33 genomes belonging mostly to Actinobacteria and Clostridia.Generally a-L-fucosidases were found in 131 analyzed genomes whereas Fuc CPs were found in 133 genomes.

Therefore obtaining the finished genomes for the studied organisms will help us to fill the gaps in the incomplete pathways.The problem of pathway incompleteness is only partially resolved by the finished versions of the analyzed genomes because incomplete pathways were also found in 13 finished genomes.

Our key results are as follows i Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans were found in 86 of the analyzed genomes which significantly higher than a previous estimation.ii Genes for the catabolism of derived monosaccharides were found in 89 of the analyzed genomes.

6 Genes that co-occurred in the genomes with only agaS were annotated as agaA and genes that co-occurred in the genomes with only nagB were annotated as nagA.

Finished genomes were selected because draft genomes do not allow us to distinguish the actual absence of the gene in the genome or the location of the gene in an unsequenced part of the genome.

Candidate functional analogs of GalT were identified as genes present in genomes having only galK but absent in genomes having galKT genes.
