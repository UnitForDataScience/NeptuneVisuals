Back- ground expression and xylose induction of this engineered strain conferred inhibitory activity against an S. aureus agr type I re- porter strain while induction of an empty vector control strain had no activity C indicating that the S. caprae agrBD genes are sufficient for production of the quorum-sensing inhibitor.Identification of the S. caprae AIP Structure To identify the structure of the S. caprae AIP mass spectrometry analysis of S. caprae spent media was performed.

Knowing that S. caprae is present transiently on human skin   it seems likely that S. caprae and S. aureus interact within the cutaneous environment and the production of the inhibitory AIP could give S. caprae a competitive advantage.

For S. aureus a ubiquitous human pathogen with a remarkable propensity for acquiring drug resistance there are mounting efforts to develop both of these alternative approaches into effective treatments for limiting infections.STARMETHODSDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the followingd d d B Bacterial Strains and PlasmidsB Miced B agr Reporter AssayB S. caprae Supernatant TreatmentsB Hemolysis AssayB S. caprae agrD Sequencing B pAgrBD Induction Experiment B Flow CytometryB LC-MS Identification of S. caprae AIP StructureB Mouse Dermonecrosis Model and Colonization ModelsB Inoculum Preparation for Assessing Quorum Quench- ing In Vivod d SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONSupplemental Information includes five figures and two tables and can be found with this article online at .AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSA.E.P.

demonstrate that the human commensal Staphylococcus caprae competes with Staphylococcus aureus by inhibiting quorum sensing.Through signal interference S. caprae reduces methicillin-resistant S. aureus burden in both skin colonization and infection highlighting the benefits of healthy skin flora and suggesting a new avenue for probiotic therapy.Paharik et al.

A biochemical assess- ment of the inhibitory activity suggested that the S. caprae autoinducing peptide AIP was respon- sible and mass spectrometric analysis identified the S. caprae AIP as an eight-residue peptide YSTCSYYF.

Little is known about the S. caprae agr system although predictions based on AgrD gene sequence suggest that it has two agr types that result in different AIP structures .In this work we characterized the S. caprae inhibitory activity and further investigated its impact on S. aureus colonization and pathogenesis.

S. caprae successfully competed against S. aureus in colonization and infection models suggesting S. caprae may have beneficial protective properties as a human commensal.RESULTSCommensal Staphylococcal Strains Secrete Inhibitors of S. aureus Quorum SensingTo test for crosstalk between staphylococcal strains we selected a small group of CoNS clinical isolates and assessed whether their spent media impacted S. aureus quorum-sensing function.
