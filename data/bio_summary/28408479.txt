We have recently shown that H. pylori binding may also be achieved through recognition of LacdiNAc-specific adhesin LabA recognizing specifically the glycan Fuca1-2Galb1-3GalNAcb1- 4GlcNAcb1-6GalNAc and being a plausible cause for the tropism of H. pylori for the gastric mucosa .ConclusionBacteria have adopted various strategies to infect their targets or colonize their host binding to mucins being a crucial step for many of them .

The ability of H. pylori to reside in the stomach mucus results from the capacity of this bacteria to buffer its environment by increasing the pH from very acidic to milder conditions using an urease but also from its propensity to bind glycan structures present on stomach mucins.In healthy individuals H. pylori binds to Leb motifs present on the stomach mucin MUC5AC via the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA present on the bacteria .

BabA-mediated binding to MUC5AC is a crucial adhesion process for H. pylori and the expression of this adhesin is a virulence factor associated with increased risk for overt disease .

The up-regulation of glycosyltransferases implicated in the biosynthesis of mucinO-glycans may result in a remodelling of secreted mucins with neo- or expression of glycan antigens favouring bacterial attachment or limiting its binding.The adherence-associated lipoprotein AB AlpAB has also been implicated in H. pylori binding to the gastric mucosa but the ligand of this adhesin seems to be the laminin constituting the basement membrane .

Whereas strong Leb-binding strains of H. pylori possess the allele babA2 Leb-non-binding strains of H. pylori usually possess a silent allele of babA gene sequence babA1 which can be activated by recombination into the babB locus.
