Finally all 38 samples fermented grain A samples n 10 control A samples n 2 tool A samples n 2 indoor ground A samples n 2 outdoor ground A samples n 2 fermented grain B samples n 10 control B samples n 2 tool B samples n 2 indoor ground B samples n 2 outdoor ground B samples n 2 and Daqu samples n 2 were transferred into the lab on ice and analyzed within 3 h.Ethanol and organic acid analysis.

Further- more Pichia Wickerhamomyces and Aspergillus were more abundant in fermented grain A during fermentation whereas Candida and Kazachstania were more abundant in fermented grain B. Additionally Saccharomycopsis and Saccharomyces were abun- dant in both fermented grains A and B at the beginning of fermentation but after fermenting for 8 days Saccharomyces was more abundant in fermented grain A than in fermented grain B. Metastats analysis revealed that 223 fungal OTUs were significantly different P  0.001 q  0.5 between fermented grains A and B and 24 OTUs in them were found with over 0.1 average abundance see Table S3 in the supplemental material.FIG 2 A Abundance of microbial communities in Daqu and fermented grains.

Significance is defined at P  0.05 with false discovery rate correction as determined by a one-way ANOVA Duncan's test.cND not detected.and 17 fungi 0.56 of fungi in fermented grain A were exclusive to fermented grain A and 34 genera 6 bacteria 0.05 of bacteria in fermented grain B and 28 fungi 1.09 of fungi in fermented grain B were exclusive to fermented grain B. Daqu shared only four and nine genera with fermented grains A and B respectively.

However for fermented grain B the main environmental source of bacterial communities was unknown .For fungal communities Daqu was the main source of both fermented grains A 80.00 and B 61.06 whereas environments contributed 19.93 of fungal com- munities to fermented grain A and 34.61 to fermented grain B.

OTU1349 Sphingobacterium was only detected in fermented grain A but five OTUs OTU1487 OTU1786 OTU2610 OTU2624 and OTU4058 attached to Lactobacillus were more abundant in fermented grain B than in fermented grain A see Table S2 in the supplemental material.For fungi Pichia Saccharomycopsis and Aspergillus were abundant in both Daqu and fermented grain samples .

Interestingly Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were only detected in fermented grain samples and were more abundant in fermented grain B than in fermented grain A.

Moreover both heat mapping and PCA showed that the concentrations of acetic acid lactic acid malic acid and ethyl acetate were higher in fermented grain B than those in fermented grain A but the trend of ethyl lactate was just the opposite  see also Table S1 in the supplemental material.

Additionally the total content of acids in fermented grain B was higher than that in that in fermented grain A whereas the contents of ethanol volatile alcohols aromatics and esters showed opposite trends see Fig.

In fermented grain B the bacterial biomass was significantly higher P  0.05 than that in fermented grain A at 0 to 4 days during fermentation.

Nevertheless the fungal biomass in fermented grain B 107.22 gene copiesg samplewas significantly higher than that in fermented grain A 105.63 gene copiesg sample at the end of fermentation see Fig.
