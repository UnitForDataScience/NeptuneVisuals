Changes in microbiota community across vector species and habitat typeComparison of mosquito microbiota or beta-diversity across samples using cluster analysis in this study indicated significant differences to a certain extent by both species and the habitats characterized in this study Figure 4.

aegypti and that further study is merited.4  DISCUSSION This study contributes significantly to our knowledge of mosquito microbiota in nature by employing culture-independent amplicon- based metagenomic deep sequencing to characterize both bac- terial and eukaryotic microbial rRNA sequences associated with field-collected mosquito vectors of disease Ae.

Further research is required to understand how the dynamics of mosquito microbiota across vectors and landscapes can affect mosquito-borne disease transmission and ultimately the impact of land use and associated habitat change on infectious dis- ease emergence.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to thank R.
