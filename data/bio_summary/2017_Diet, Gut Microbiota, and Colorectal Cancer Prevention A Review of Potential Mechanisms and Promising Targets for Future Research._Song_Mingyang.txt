However because most evidence is from animal or small human studies with short-term interven- tion it remains to be characterized how the community struc- ture and function of the gut microbiota varies with host adi- posity over a long-term period which is more relevant tocancer development .Given the link between obesity and gut microbiota and the role of the gut microbiota in cancer development it has been proposed that changes in the gut microbiota may contribute to obesity-associated carcinogenesis.

Biological plausibility is sup- ported by habitation of numerous gut microbes in the large intestine and the functional importance of the gut microbiota in maintenance of the gut barrier integrity and immune ho- meostasis the disruptions of which are among the most im- portant mechanisms in colorectal carcinogenesis .

Given the critical role of diet in the configurations of gut microbial communities and production of bacterial metabolites it has been proposed that diet may influence CRC risk through modulation of the gut microbial composition and metabolism that in turn shape the immune response during tumor development.Overall the gut microbiome exhibits substantial inter- individual variation but high overall temporal stability withinTable 1Summary of epidemiologic studies examining the association of the fecal microbiome with colorectal cancerAhn 2013butyrate-producing bacteriaUSACase-control47 cancers94 controls Diversity  Clostridia  Fusobacterium PorphyromonasZackular 2014 Zeller 2014Feng 2015USACase-control30 cancers30 adenomas30 controlsFranceCase-control91 cancers42 adenomas358 controlsAustriaCase-control41 cancers42 adenomas55 controls Bacteroides fragilis Fusobacterium Porphyromonas butyrate-producing bacteria Bacteroidetes Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria Actinobacteria and Firmicutes B. dorei B. vulgatus E. coli Fusobacterium Lactobacillus and BifidobacteriumVogtmann 2016 USA FranceCase-control52 cancers52 controls Fusobacterium Porphyromonas ClostridiaYu 2017Denmark France AustriaCase-control74 cancers54 controls Peptostreptococcus stomatis F. nucleatum Parvimonas micraSolobacterium mooreiShah 2017MultiplecountriesPooled analysis of case-control studies195 cancers79 adenomas235 controls Parvimonas micra ATCC 33270 Streptococcus anginosus yet-to-be cultured members of ProteobacteriaLiang 2017ChinaCase-control203 cancers236 controls F. nucleatum Clostridium hathewayi  B. clarusFlemer 2017IrelandCase-control43 cancers37 controls Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis and Coprococcusindividuals -.

The study suggests a model of mechanisms by which dietary fiber may protect against colorectal cancer in a gut microbiota- and butyrate- dependent manner and provides a potential explanation for inconsistent findings about the relationship of fiber intake and colorectal cancer risk reported in epidemiologic studies.Tang Y Chen Y Jiang H et al.

Colorectal neoplasiaIntroductionColorectal cancer CRC is the third most commonly diag- nosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the world .

Western diets are associated with gut dysbiosis microbial imbalance   loss of gut bar- rier integrity   increased levels of inflammatory pro- teins - and dysregulated immune signatures -.

A potential role of the gut microbiota in mediating the dietary associations with CRC risk is suggested by the dramatic dif- ference of the gut microbial structures between populations consuming different diets.

Moreover luminal unabsorbed omega-3fatty acid may alter the gut environmental conditions and changes in immune response due to omega-3 fatty acid may in turn confer selective pressure on the gut mi- crobial community   .

Mechanistic data suggest that the gut microbiota may in- fluence energy homeostasis and obesity pathogenesis through several pathways including peripheral control of energy har- vest central regulation of food intake via the gut-brain neural communication and inflammation and impaired gut barrier through activation of pattern recognition receptors -.

Taken together these data support that while the gut microbial profile may change due to changes in body weight accompanied by systemic metabolic alterations the composition of the gut microbiota can also predispose to the development of obesity.
