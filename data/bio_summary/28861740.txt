obesity stress  irritable bowel syndrome and a variety of autoimmune diseases  all of which are known to increase intestinal permeability may be associ- ated with physiologic bowel fdg uptake.a previously mentioned study demonstrated suppressed bowel fdg uptake by rifaximin and showed that bacteria are responsible for the retention of fdg.

group 2 included subjects with intestinal fdg uptake equal to or higher than liver fdg uptake among group 2 subjects subjects with relatively focal or intense fdg uptake in the intestine were reclassified as group 3 fig.

we compared the indices between group 1 vs. 2 group 1 vs. 3 group 2 vs. 3 group 1 vs. 2and 3 and groups 1 and 2 vs. 3. there was no significant difference in 18f-fdg uptake in all indices of alpha diversity additional file figure s1 and table s1 be- tween groups.the permanova analysis showed a significant p  0.047 pseudo-f  1.57 difference in bray-curtis distances between groups 1 and 2 although the comparison of the bacterial communities by principal coordinate analysis pcoa plot with the bray-curtis distance could not easily distinguish between the two groups additional file figure s2.association of intestinal 18f-fdg uptake with gut microbiota we next examined whether differences in the abun- dances of specific bacterial taxa were associated with intestinal 18f -fdg uptake.

further investigations may be needed to exclude the possibility of malignancy and these require additional time and cost.the etiology of bowel fdg activity without pathologic lesions also called physiologic bowel uptake or activity correspondence  ji yeon kang and han-na kim are first authors and contributed equally to this work.4department of family medicine kangbuk samsung hospital sungkyunkwanuniversity school of medicine 29 saemunan-ro jongnogu seoul 03181 south korea2department of biochemistry ewha womans university school of medicine1071 anyangcheon-ro yangcheon-gu seoul 07985 south korea full list of author information is available at the end of the articleis not thoroughly understood.

due to these dissimilarities the difference in bmi and lipid profile among groups may not be noticeable.hfd leads to intestinal inflammation metabolic endo- toxemia increased intestinal permeability and obesity if physiologic bowel fdg uptake is associated with intestinal permeability many factors are likely to affect bowel fdg activity including the hfd.

group 1 included subjects with intestinal fdg uptake lower than liver fdg uptake.

the uptake ratio of tb suvmax and tb suvmean to liver suvmean tb to liver uptake ratio tbrmax and tbrmean was calculated for each subject.fecal samples and dna extractionfecal samples were immediately frozen after defecation at -20 degc and were placed at -70 degc within 24 h. within 1 month the stool specimens were vortexed to achieve a homogenous suspension and homogenized to isolate dna using the powersoilr dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca according to the manufac- turer's instructions.pcr amplification and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene variable v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rrna were amplified with the universal primers f319 5' tcgtcggcagcgtc agatgtgtataagagacag and r806 5'-ggactachvgggtwtctaat-3'  with each primer modified to contain a unique 8-nt barcode index by com- bination with the nexterar xt dna library preparation kit illumina san diego ca.

reported that physiologic bowel fdg uptake was increased more at the delayed phase than at the early phase in dual-time-point petct imaging .

reported that physiologic bowel fdg uptake was suppressed by antibiotics such as rifaximin they suggested that bacteria play a role in accumu- lating fdg and may ingest fdg that has migrated intoc the authors.

this suggestion alone cannot account for individual differences in physiologic bowel fdg uptake.

observed that obese subjects had lower uncultured clostri- diales than non-obese subjects the relationship between diet and bowel fdg uptake is still unclear however we can cautiously speculate re- garding the associations between these factors.

a previ- ous study demonstrated that the suv of background intestinal fdg uptake was positively correlated with bmi and lipid profile in female korean patients with breast cancer however we did not observe a signifi- cant difference in bmi and lipid profiles based on bowel fdg activity.

the potential of fusobacterium seems to be worth describ- ing although we could not exclude the possibility of an inci- dental association due to small sample size.fusobacterium was reported to be increased in obese people compared to lean people in a japanese study population a majority of studies reported that the fusobacterium was enriched in intestinal inflammation colorectal adenoma and cancer recently a korean study reported that the prevalence of colorectal adenoma was increased according to physiologic bowel fdg activity the authors assumed that the contri- bution of gut flora may explain the significant associ- ation between background intestinal 18f-fdg uptake and the prevalence of colorectal adenoma.

fusobacterium might explain these associations but further investigationis needed to ascertain the link between the fusobacteriumand physiologic fdg uptake.the associations between fusobacterium and obesity and between obesity and physiologic bowel fdg uptake have not yet been revealed in the western population.
