Moreover to replace a relatively invasive meas- urement 18F-FDG PETCT can provide a non-invasive method and contribute to widen the research field of in- testinal permeability in the clinical or preclinical setting.Additional fileAbbreviations18F-FDG Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose BMI Body mass indexCT Computed tomography FDR False discovery rate FODMAP Fermentable oligo- di- and mono-saccharides and polyols GLM Generalized linear model GLUT Glucose transporter HbA1c Hemoglobin A1c HFD High fat diet log2FC Log2 fold change OTU Operational taxonomic unit PCoA Principal coordinate analysis PERMANOVA Permutational multivariate analysis of variance PET Positron emission tomography rRNA Ribosomal Ribonucleic acid SUVmax Maximum standardized uptake value SUVmean Mean standardized uptake value TBRmax Uptake ratio of SUVmax of total bowel to SUVmean of the liver TBRmean Uptake ratio of SUVmean of total bowel to SUVmean of the liver VOI Volume of interestAcknowledgementsThis study was supported with the computing resources by Global Science experimental Data hub Center GSDC Project and Korea Research Environment Open NETwork KREONET in Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information KISTI.FundingThis research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea NRF funded by the Ministry of Education NRF-2017R1D1A1B03035501 and NRF-2016R1A6A3A11932719.

Obesity stress  irritable bowel syndrome and a variety of autoimmune diseases  all of which are known to increase intestinal permeability may be associ- ated with physiologic bowel FDG uptake.A previously mentioned study demonstrated suppressed bowel FDG uptake by Rifaximin and showed that bacteria are responsible for the retention of FDG.

Group 2 included subjects with intestinal FDG uptake equal to or higher than liver FDG uptake among group 2 subjects subjects with relatively focal or intense FDG uptake in the intestine were reclassified as group 3 Fig.

There was no significant difference in 18F-FDG uptake in all indices of alpha diversity Additional file Figure S1 and Table S1 be- tween groups.The PERMANOVA analysis showed a significant p  0.047 pseudo-F  1.57 difference in Bray-Curtis distances between groups 1 and 2 although the comparison of the bacterial communities by principal coordinate analysis PCoA plot with the Bray-Curtis distance could not easily distinguish between the two groups Additional file Figure S2.Association of intestinal 18F-FDG uptake with gut microbiota We next examined whether differences in the abun- dances of specific bacterial taxa were associated with intestinal 18F -FDG uptake.

Further investigations may be needed to exclude the possibility of malignancy and these require additional time and cost.The etiology of bowel FDG activity without pathologic lesions also called physiologic bowel uptake or activity Correspondence  Ji Yeon Kang and Han-Na Kim are first authors and contributed equally to this work.4Department of Family Medicine Kangbuk Samsung Hospital SungkyunkwanUniversity School of Medicine 29 Saemunan-ro Jongnogu Seoul 03181 South Korea2Department of Biochemistry Ewha Womans University School of Medicine1071 Anyangcheon-ro Yangcheon-gu Seoul 07985 South Korea Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleis not thoroughly understood.

Due to these dissimilarities the difference in BMI and lipid profile among groups may not be noticeable.HFD leads to intestinal inflammation metabolic endo- toxemia increased intestinal permeability and obesity If physiologic bowel FDG uptake is associated with intestinal permeability many factors are likely to affect bowel FDG activity including the HFD.

Group 1 included subjects with intestinal FDG uptake lower than liver FDG uptake.

The uptake ratio of TB SUVmax and TB SUVmean to liver SUVmean TB to liver uptake ratio TBRmax and TBRmean was calculated for each subject.Fecal samples and DNA extractionFecal samples were immediately frozen after defecation at -20 degC and were placed at -70 degC within 24 h. Within 1 month the stool specimens were vortexed to achieve a homogenous suspension and homogenized to isolate DNA using the PowerSoilr DNA Isolation Kit MO BIO Laboratories Carlsbad CA according to the manufac- turer's instructions.PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene Variable V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA were amplified with the universal primers F319 5' TCGTCGGCAGCGTC AGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG and R806 5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3'  with each primer modified to contain a unique 8-nt barcode index by com- bination with the NexteraR XT DNA Library Preparation kit Illumina San Diego CA.

reported that physiologic bowel FDG uptake was increased more at the delayed phase than at the early phase in dual-time-point PETCT imaging .

reported that physiologic bowel FDG uptake was suppressed by antibiotics such as rifaximin They suggested that bacteria play a role in accumu- lating FDG and may ingest FDG that has migrated intoc The Authors.
