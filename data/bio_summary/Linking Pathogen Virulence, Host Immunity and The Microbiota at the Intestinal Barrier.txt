abstractsmeetings of the keio medical societylinking pathogen virulence host immunity and the microbiota at the intestinal barriergabriel nunezdepartment of pathology and comprehensive cancer center university of michigan michigan usathe mechanisms that allow enteric pathogens to colo- nize the intestine and host immunity as well as the in- digenous microbiota to inhibit pathogen colonization remain poorly understood.

these studies have revealed how the pathogen colonizes and replicates successfullyearly during infection and how host immunity and the indigenous microbiota cooperate to eradicate the patho- gen in the later stage of the infection.

the impairment of the immune system to control the barrier function of the intestine leads to pathogen invasion and the induction of a second layer of host protective immunity to limit the systemic spread of the pathogen.presented at the 1931st meeting january 17 2017mechanisms of ips cell generation and beyondkeisuke kajimrc centre for regenerative medicine university of edinburgh edinburgh united kingdomthe generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ip- scs achieved by overexpression of oct4 sox2 klf4 and c-myc transformed our classical views of the cellular epigenetic landscape and delivered a new concept for cell and tissue engineering.
