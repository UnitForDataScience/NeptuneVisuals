Results show that A. borbonica polyphenols exhibited free radical-scavenging activity as well as caffeic acid chlorogenic acid and kaempferol used as positive controls suggesting their possible contribution to A. borbonica extract antioxidant activity.Anti-inflammatory effects of A. borbonica polyphenols on LPS-treated adipose cellsIt is well known that LPS mediates pro-inflammatory effects via activation of innate immunity receptors.

Preconditioning of cells with caffeic acid chlorogenic acid or kaempferol identified among A. borbonica major polyphenols led to a similar protective.curcumin-enriched fractions This provides new perspec- tives for the use of A. borbonica polyphenol-rich extract as a source of bioactive compounds with potential uses in pharmaceutical preparations.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that A. borbonica polyphenols exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on adipocytes exposed to P. gingivalis or E. coli LPS.

Taken together these findings demonstrate the antioxidant effects of A. borbonica polyphenols on adipocytes exposed to LPS and suggest the possi- ble contribution of caffeic acid chlorogenic acid and kaempferol to the beneficial action of A. borbonica polyphenol-rich extract.DiscussionThis study evaluated the possible benefits of A. borbonicapolyphenols on adipose cells exposed to LPS from P. gingivalis andE.

Total polyphenol content was expressed as gallic acid equivalent g gallic acid100 g plant powder.Evaluation of free radical-scavenging capacity of A. borbonica polyphenolsTo assess free radical-scavenging activity of A. borbonica polyphenols the 22-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH and oxy- gen radical absorbance capacity ORAC assays were performed according to the methods previously described Briefly 0.25 mM DPPH diluted in methanol was incubated with 25 uM plant polyphenols.

Significant differences were considered for p values 0.05.ResultsIdentification and free radical-scavenging capacity of A. borbonica polyphenolsUPLC-MS analysis of A. borbonica polyphenol-rich extract led to identify two major groups of phenolic acids namely chloro- genic acids and dicaffeoylquinic acids which are derivatives of caffeic acid Moreover kaempferol belonging to the family of flavonoids was detected under its kaempferol-O-hexoside- O-rhamnoside forms.

Of note the extent of these anti-inflammatory properties varied depending on the bacterial origin of LPS and the adipokine marker considered.Antioxidant effects of A. borbonica polyphenols on LPS-treated adipose cellsOxidative stress is reported to alter adipokine production contributing to adipose tissue chronic inflammation and obesity- related insulin resistance We evaluated the impact of A. borbonica polyphenol-rich extract on the redox status of adi- pose cells exposed to P. gingivalis or E. coli LPS.

Even if this dose is higher than cir- culating concentrations reaching less than 10 uM in nutritionalconditions it is the pharmacological dose broadly used in the liter- ature and in our published studies Concerning A. borbonica polyphenols we previously showed that they did not affect 3T3-L1 cell viability for doses ranging 25-250 uM Thus the biological effects of plant polyphenols used at 25 uM were not related to an altered viability of adipose cells.Our study demonstrates the ability of A. borbonica polyphe- nols to improve the inflammatory response of adipose cells exposed to LPS.

It will be of major interest to assess A. borbonica polyphenol benefits against obesity-related metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance in vivo.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
