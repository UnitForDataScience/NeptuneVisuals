however one experiment was conducted to determine the effects of dietary brazilian red pepper essential oil or antimicrobial growth promoter on intestinal health and growth performance of weanling pigs.results no effects of treatments were observed on performance and organ weights p  0.05. overall both additives red pepper essential oil rpeo or antibiotic ant increased gut lactobacillus counts compared to negative control as well as reduced villi density p  0.05. animals fed diets containing 1.5 g kg-1 rpeo presented the lowest incidence of diarrhea p  0.05.conclusion our findings suggested that essential oil from brazilian red pepper or chlorohydroxyquinoline added in weanling pig diets affect gut microbiota and histology without affecting performance and organ weights.

in addition we carried out an in vivo assay focusing the relationship between instestinal immune system microbiota and host response.14to the best of our knowledge this study evaluated piglets' diet containing rpeo or antimicrobial growth promoter on growth per- formance diarrhea incidence organ weights intestinal bacterial counts and intestinal epithelium morphology at the first 2 weeks after weaning.material and methodsall procedures involving animals were previously approved by the ethics committee for the use of animals of the universidade estad- ual de santa cruz ilheus ba brazil protocol number 0242011.chemical composition of the essential oil from brazilian red pepperbrazilian red pepper essential oil was acquired from the agro- rosa ltda company sao mateus es brazil and extraction was performed by the steam distillation technique utilizing mature fruits.

brazilian red pepper is known to have pharmacological properties to prevent diarrhea which have been attributed to the phenolic compounds present in its fruits.36 the use of compounds such as limonene eugenol pinene and cinnamaldehyde as well as plant extracts such as fennel quince basil and lemon balm have been reported to reduce the clinical symptoms of diarrhea in piglets being thought to be associated with an improved immune status owing to the changes in the gut microbiota3738 as observed in this study.conclusionsthe inclusion of brazilian red pepper essential oil or chlorohy- droxyquinoline in weanling pig diets during 14 days post-weaning modulate gut microbiota by increasing lactobacillus and reducing enterobacteria counts without affecting the growth performanceand organ weights.
