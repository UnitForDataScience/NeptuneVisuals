although red ginseng goes through the same pharmacological changes and is not entirely different from ginseng there have been reports showing that the efficacy of red ginseng in enhancing blood circulation cancer suppression and defense against various infections is superior to that of ginseng 20-21. furthermore the various efficacies of red ginseng including anti-inflammation have been reported to arise from rg3 rf and rh2 22-23.the saponin components of red ginseng are not directly absorbed into the body after administration but first are converted to metabolites by intestinal microorganisms such as bifidobacterium spp.

1c.oral administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng exerts inhibitory effects on myeloperoxidase and lipid peroxidation in the colon of mice with dss-induced colitismpo is a constituent of neutrophils and serves as a good indicator of inflammatory levels in tissue 29. when we measured the level of mpo activity in the colon tissues from the dss-treated control mice the level was significantly p  0.001 increased compared to that of the normal untreated mice.

collectively oral administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng reduced the severity of colitis in a mouse model suggesting that it can be used as a uniformly effective red ginseng product.key words colitis fermentation inflammation probiotics red ginsengclc number r965 document code a article id 2095-6975201703-0192-10introductioninflammatory bowel disease such as crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is a chronic and recurrent disease of the digestive system that occurs when a genetically vulnerable person is exposed to certain environmental factors or an inducer.

in order to produce homogeneously effective red ginseng we prepared probiotic-fermented red ginseng and evaluated its activity using a dextran sulfate sodium dss-induced colitis model in mice.

statistical significance of the results was determined byone-way or two-way analysis of variance anova and p  0.05 p  0.01 and p  0.001 indicated significant differences in various degrees between various groups.resultsoral administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng is effective in improving the pathological state of colons from the mice with dss-induced colitiswe observed the clinical effects of oral administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng gs  pb fig.

the metabolites exert the main pharmacological activities of red ginseng 24-25. for this reason despite the various and superior pharmacological effects of red ginseng its efficacy after oral administration varies according to the intestinal conditions of an individual.

consequently there is an assumption that the biological change in red ginseng in the anaerobic state is similar to that inside the intestine where intestinal microorganisms use fermentation to transform the components of red ginseng into final metabolites which may help to produce a uniformly effective product that is easily absorbed independent of the individual's intestinal conditions26.

therefore we prepared the probiotic-fermented redginseng powder and confirmed its efficacy in alleviatinginflammation in a dextran-sulfate sodium dss-induced mouse colitis model as known in red ginseng.materials and methodspreparation of probiotic-fermented ginseng powder and experimental materialsthe red ginseng extract powder was obtained from kunbo inc. jinan korea.

the data are presented as means - sd n  4 of triplicate experiments and p  0.001 indicates a significant differenceoral administration of probiotic-fermented red ginseng exerts inhibitory effects on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokinesin order to determine the influence of oral administrationof probiotic-fermented red ginseng on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression we determined the serum level of il-6 and tnf-a the representative pro-inflammatory cytokines.

one such functional product of current interest is red ginseng and its anti-inflammatory activity has been well analyzed 23. however given that the main pharmacological components of red ginseng need tobe converted to metabolites that have pharmacological activities to be absorbed by intestinal microbiota its efficacy after oral administration varies significantly among individuals.

to develop a uniformly effective red ginseng product we prepared probiotic-fermented red ginseng and assessed its efficacy in alleviating inflammatory response using a mouse dss-induced colitis model.

from these results we conclude that probiotic-fermented red ginseng has remedial value based on our confirmation of the antioxidant effects that alleviate dss-induced colitis symptoms suggesting that probiotic-fermented red ginsengcould be an important substance in the development of a cure for colitis by controlling the inflammatory response in tissues.referencesadachi m kurotani r morimura k et al.
