The gut microbiome interacts with the host and fulfills pivotal roles in host metabolic function environmental contaminants from various chemical families such as heavy metals HMs and pesticides have been shown to negatively alter the gut microbiome and cause a state of 'dysbiosis'  .

The DEseq package was used for metagenomics data normalization.ResultsMalathion exposure disturbed gut microbiome development trajectoryThe principal coordinate analysis PCoA of beta diversity plots A showed that at the genus level the trajectories of the gut microbiome community structures from week 0 to week 13 were readily differentiable between the controls and the malathion-treated mice.

The dose was chosen to examine whether ma- lathion perturbs the gut microbiome and its functions even at the dose that is below the threshold for neurotoxicity 3 mice were provided standard pelleted rodent diet and treated humanely and with regard toalleviate suffering 4 the housing conditions were 22 degC 40-70 hu- midity and a 1212 h lightdark cycle.

The difference in the gut microbiome composition was analyzed using a non-parametric test via Metastats software  as de- scribed previously .

The relative abundance of the genes encoding cell wall components was increased in malathion- treated mice .DiscussionWith the combination of 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun meta- genomics sequencing we have demonstrated that malathion exposure disturbed the trajectory of the gut microbiome and quorum-sensing system.

The relative abundance of bacterial genes involved in quorum sensing-related behaviors such as motility and pathogenicity was in- creased in malathion-treated mice.The disruption of the gut microbiome community structure caused by environmental chemicals has been well documented  .

These findings may provide a novel mechanistic understanding of the role of quorum-sensing in the gut microbiome toxicity of malathion.IntroductionThe gut microbiome is a dynamic and complex ecosystem that is acquired after birth and shaped over time by a combination of various factors including genotype diet environmental exposure and the use of antibiotics .

The predominant biodegradation pathway of malathion is through carboxylesterase activity leading to the formation of monoacid and diacid metabolites .

The experimental design was as fol- lows 1 mice were randomly assigned to either a control or malathion- treated group 5 mice in each group 2 malathion in drinking water was administered to mice at a concentration of 2 mgL 0.6 mgkg body weightday for a study period of 13 weeks while control mice received water alone.
