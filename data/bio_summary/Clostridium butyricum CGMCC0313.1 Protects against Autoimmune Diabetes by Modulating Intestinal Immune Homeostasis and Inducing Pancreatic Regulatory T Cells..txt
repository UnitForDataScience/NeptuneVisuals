lactobacillaceae clostridiaceae desulfovibrionaceae increased by 49.97 161.26 p  0.05 200.07 p  0.01respectively in nod-cb mice vs nod controls .additionally the following genera were increased significantly in nod-cb mice vs nod controls clostridium by 3.54-fold p  0.05 desulfovibrionaceaeg by 2.76-fold p  0.05 helicobacteraceaeg by 2.52-fold p  0.05 lactobacillus by 1.72-fold p  0.05 and allobaculum by 111-fold whereas the following genera decreased significantly in nod-cb mice vs nod controls bacteroides by 41.5 p  0.05 prevotella by 65.43 p  0.05 odoribacter by 44.39 p  0.05 lactococcus by 93.18 p  0.01 candidatus arthromitus by 98.94 p  0.05 helicobacter by 95.06 p  0.05 and f16g by 55.63 p  0.05 .

to test our hypothesis we investigated the cytokine profile of t cells from mln.intracellular staining for ifn-g il-4 and il-17a demon- strated lower percentages of ifn-g il-4 cd4 t cells and simi- lar percentages of il-17a cd4 t cells from mln of nod-cb mice vs nod controls at 13 weeks of age p  0.05 p  0.01 and  respectively.intranuclear staining from mln cells showed an increasingtrend of foxp3 abundance 11.60 foxp3 in cd4 t cells in nod-cb mice vs 8.99 in nod controls at 6 weeks .

intracellular staining for cytokine profile of t cells from thepancreas demonstrated a lower percentage of ifn-g il-17a and a higher percentage of il-4 cd4 t cells in nod-cb mice vs nod controls as well as increased protein level of il-4.these findings demonstrate that cb0313.1 reduces pancreas inflammation and reversed the imbalance in th1th2th17 tregs.cb0313.1 changes the splenic cytokine profileswe analyzed splenic tregs and found no differences in treg levels among nod-cb mice and nod controls until 45 weeks .furthermore we analyzed cytokine profiles in the spleen and found a significant decrease in ifn-g-producing th1 cells and an increase in il-4-producing th2 cells .unexpectedly the frequencies of th17 cells were increased significantly in the spleen of nod-cb mice vs nod controls at 45 weeks of age .

nod-cb mice showed a significantly lower respiratory exchange ratio rer compared to nod controls indicating decreased glucose oxida- tion and increased fat and protein oxidation in nod-cb mice  p  0.001. meanwhile we observed significantlyincreased physical activity  p  0.01 in the nighttimeand decreased heat production  p  0.001 for day and p  0.05 for night in nod-cb mice vs nod controls.

p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 vs nod control mice.to investigate how cb0313.1 affected energy metabolism we administered nod mice with metabolite nab by gavage at 800 mgkgday from 3 weeks ofage according to therecommended dosage of a previous study  and observed an earlier onset of t1d at 9 weeks of age in nod-nab mice vs 11 weeks of age in nod controls data not shown.

however cb0313.1 administration sig- nificantly increased not only bacteria carrying the buk gene by 7-fold p  0.01 but also those carrying the butyryl-coa gene by 4-fold p  0.05  demonstrating that probiotic cb0313.1 also promoted the growth of other butyrate-producing bacteria.

principal coordinate analysis pcoa showed that cb0313.1 significantly modified the overall structure of the gut microbiota along the first principal component pc1  p  0.01. we found that supplementation with cb0313.1 effectively increased intestinal cb0313.1 by 12370-fold demonstrating itsability to efficiently colonize the gut .typically two genes buk and butyryl-coa are used as biomarkers for the detection of butyrate-producing communi- ties.

however at 13 weeks of age we observed a sig- nificantly increased proportion of pancreatic tregs in nod-cb mice vs nod controls as well as increased tgf-b and il-10 sup-porting the hypothesis that oral cb0313.1 may exert its protectiveeffects via tregs and associated cytokines  p  0.01. increased tgf-b in pancreas also suggests that cb0313.1 may induce tregs via tgf-b related mechanism.although we showed that cb0313.1 could induce pancreatictregs at 13 weeks of age whether this induction is a long-standing effect remained to be determined.

thus we speculate that cb0313.1 might be involved in type 2 immunity inducing tregs thereby retarding andor suppressing the onset of t1d  .although cb0313.1 only carries the buk gene oral adminis- tration of cb0313.1 also causes a significant increase in butyrate- producing bacteria carrying the butyryl-coa gene  which might be explained by a modification of the other butyrate- producing bacteria by cb0313.1 via an unknown mechanism.
