Lactobacillaceae Clostridiaceae Desulfovibrionaceae increased by 49.97 161.26 p  0.05 200.07 p  0.01respectively in NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls .Additionally the following genera were increased significantly in NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls Clostridium by 3.54-fold p  0.05 Desulfovibrionaceaeg by 2.76-fold p  0.05 Helicobacteraceaeg by 2.52-fold p  0.05 Lactobacillus by 1.72-fold p  0.05 and Allobaculum by 111-fold whereas the following genera decreased significantly in NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls Bacteroides by 41.5 p  0.05 Prevotella by 65.43 p  0.05 Odoribacter by 44.39 p  0.05 Lactococcus by 93.18 p  0.01 Candidatus Arthromitus by 98.94 p  0.05 Helicobacter by 95.06 p  0.05 and F16g by 55.63 p  0.05 .

To test our hypothesis we investigated the cytokine profile of T cells from MLN.Intracellular staining for IFN-g IL-4 and IL-17A demon- strated lower percentages of IFN-g IL-4 CD4 T cells and simi- lar percentages of IL-17A CD4 T cells from MLN of NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls at 13 weeks of age p  0.05 p  0.01 and  respectively.Intranuclear staining from MLN cells showed an increasingtrend of Foxp3 abundance 11.60 Foxp3 in CD4 T cells in NOD-CB mice vs 8.99 in NOD controls at 6 weeks .

Intracellular staining for cytokine profile of T cells from thepancreas demonstrated a lower percentage of IFN-g IL-17A and a higher percentage of IL-4 CD4 T cells in NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls as well as increased protein level of IL-4.These findings demonstrate that CB0313.1 reduces pancreas inflammation and reversed the imbalance in Th1Th2Th17 Tregs.cB0313.1 changes the splenic cytokine ProfilesWe analyzed splenic Tregs and found no differences in Treg levels among NOD-CB mice and NOD controls until 45 weeks .Furthermore we analyzed cytokine profiles in the spleen and found a significant decrease in IFN-g-producing Th1 cells and an increase in IL-4-producing Th2 cells .Unexpectedly the frequencies of Th17 cells were increased significantly in the spleen of NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls at 45 weeks of age .

Majordifferenceswereobserved at the level of dominant families Bacteroidaceae Prevotellaceae Rikenellaceae Streptococcaceae and F16 decreased by 46.27 66.67 p  0.05 27.56 p  0.05 92.09 p  0.01 and p  0.05 respectively in NOD-CB mice vs NOD controls.

p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 vs NOD control mice.To investigate how CB0313.1 affected energy metabolism we administered NOD mice with metabolite NaB by gavage at 800 mgkgday from 3 weeks ofage according to therecommended dosage of a previous study  and observed an earlier onset of T1D at 9 weeks of age in NOD-NaB mice vs 11 weeks of age in NOD controls data not shown.

However CB0313.1 administration sig- nificantly increased not only bacteria carrying the buk gene by 7-fold p  0.01 but also those carrying the butyryl-CoA gene by 4-fold p  0.05  demonstrating that probiotic CB0313.1 also promoted the growth of other butyrate-producing bacteria.
