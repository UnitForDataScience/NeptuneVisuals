To evaluate whether longitudinal levels of the top diversity metabolite pre- dicted MetS status we ran independent linear regression models each for Shannon diversity the metabolite trend determined using empirical Bayes predictions as above the diet score and metabolitediet-associated OTUs taxa to predict MetS status adjusting for age sex and family relatedness.Longitudinal Metabolite association with MetS mediated by Shannon diversity the diet score and specific taxa.

Neuroglobin expressed in neurons and some endocrine tissues acts to protect cells against hypoxia and oxidative stress.Overall increased abundances OTUstaxa of the Actinomycetaceae family and the genera Eubacterium and Ruminococcus were associated with reduced hippurate and the diet and increased MetS risk and increased abun- dances of OTUs of the order Clostridiales and the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were associated with increased hippurate and diet score and reduced MetS risk.The Actinomycetaceae family are typical commensals present within the oral cavity.

Spector1  Cristina Menni1Reduced gut microbiome diversity is associated with multiple disorders including metabolic syndrome MetS features though metabolomic markers have not been investigated.

Many of the above metabolites are food-derived therefore merging microbiome and metabolomics approaches with studies which capture habitual intake is the logical next step for improving our understanding of the complex interplay between diet the microbiome and metabolic disease.To date there are relatively few short-term human dietary intervention studies incorporating the microbiome and metabolome.

a Shows the associations between MetS with Shannon diversity the hippurate trend and OTUstaxa significantly associated with hippurate the diet score and MetS represented as betas with SEs all variables have been standardized.

The aim of this analysis was to determine how much of the variance in the metabolite trend and MetS was accounted for by the MetS association with Shannon diversity the diet score or specific OTUstaxa.

In the second part the relationship between longitudinal levels of the diversity metabolite marker diet diversity and associated OTUstaxa with the risk of MetS was explored.Part 1 Metabolomics associations with diversity relationship to food intake and associations with microbiome OTUstaxa.

61.1 of the effect of the hippurate trend on MetS was accounted for by the association between Shannon diversity and MetS.
