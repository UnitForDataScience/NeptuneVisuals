We used citrus and HLB as a plant hostdisease model to investigate i the relationship between leaf- and root-associated microbial communi- ties and host plant ii the interactions between native microbiota and a phytopatho- gen and iii the core microbiota their prevalence within the broader microbial communities and correlations between community structure and plant disease among other factors.RESULTSCitrus-associated microbial community structure and core microbiota.

Our findings advance the understanding of i plant microbiota selection across multiple variables and ii changes in core community structure that may be a precondition to disease estab- lishment andor may be associated with symptom progression.IMPORTANCE This study provides a comprehensive overview of the core microbial community within the microbiomes of plant hosts that vary in extent of disease symptom progression.

The severity of HLB is underscored by the billions of dollars in economic damage and thousands of jobs lost throughout Florida where L. asiaticus is widespread thatTABLE 1 Characterization of the microbial communities of leaf and root samples from 73 citrus trees across FloridaaaFor each sample set the location citrus cultivar sampling date number of trees sampled numbers of leaf and root microbial communities included in data analyses i.e.

so that the native community is not disrupted warrants further investigation.Separate from the correlations between microbial community structure and HLB symptom expression there were unique associations between the plant microbiota and location cultivar season and time which have been previously discussed     .

Given the limited number of studies that have discerned the core members of plant-associated microbial communities    much remains unknown about the structure of the core community among all microbiota and its importance with regard to plant health.A growing number of studies have focused on understanding how the plant microbiome changes during disease development   .

The impor- tance of core taxa within broader plant-associated microbial communities is dis- cussed.KEYWORDS core microbiome plant-associated microbiota Liberibacter pathogen- microbe interactionsJune 2017 Volume 83 Issue 11 e00210-17Applied and Environmental Microbiology 1he coevolution of microorganisms with plant hosts has given rise to finely tuned symbiotic and parasitic relationships that are central to plant growth and health.

Potential plant-beneficial bacteria that were differentially abundant within the trees that had varied in HLB symptom severity could have been involved in i competing with Liberibacter for nutrient resources limiting its ability to grow and spread ii antibiosis toward the pathogen or other disease-associated bacteria iii assistance with host nutrient acquisition which could help alleviate disease symptom-related nutrient deficiencies or iv induction of host plant signaling pathways that stimulated plant defense responses.

detected in at least 95 of the respective leaf or root samples some overrepresented site-specific members and a diverse community of low- abundance variable taxa.

In addition for the three asymptomatic varieties sampled in Quincy there were substantial differences between the community structures of Owari and Honeybell leaf microbiota ANOSIM R statistic 0.959 significance based on 999 permutations 0.023 and root microbiota ANOSIM R statistic 0.867 significance based on 999 permutations 0.016.
