We apply this technology to release dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA a neurosteroid that promotes neurogenesis and neuron survival and determined the timescale of neuronal activation by DHEA using light-induced release of DHEA from targeted DNA nanocapsules.

On quantifying the prematurely activated neurons at t  0.1 s grey we found that 50 of all DHEA-responsive neurons were prematurely acti- vated by DPD10.In the case of 2 mM IDpD10 added to neurons see Supplementary Information for experimental details we could clearly observe a complete trajectory of Ca2 elevation in all responsive neurons white arrowheads and Supplementary Movie 5.

Although several neurons showed activation after release of DHEA from DPD10 white arrowheads note that prior to photo-uncaging many neurons were already activated red arrowheads by DPD10.

Addition of DHEA 10 nM immediately raised intracellular Ca2 in all responsive neurons red arrowheads and Supplementary Movie 3 compared with neurons not exposed to DHEA and Supplementary Movie 2.

The kinetics of intracellular Ca2 influx for n  10 neurons due to photo-uncaging DHEA from IDpD10 is shown in It revealed that DHEA-induced neuronal activation shows a t12 half time required for the receptor activation of 10 s. Importantly the basal level of activation prior to photoirradiation was comparable to neurons without DHEA 4a indicating negligible premature neuronal activation.

We reasoned that the encapsulation of photocaged DHEA within an icosahedral DNA shell would prevent such background activation while permitting photo-uncaged DHEA molecules to diffuse out of the capsule and activate those neurons on which the nanocapsules are localized.DNA icosahedra containing DPD10 IDpD10 were first localized on the plasma membrane of cultured neurons.

A molecule like DPD10 could potentially circumventNATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY  ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION  5this problem where photoirradiation would trigger DHEA release from DPD10 that would in turn activate neurons.

Light- mediated release of DHEA then activated neurons and revealed the kinetics of this neuronal activation a process that has so far proved elusive to measure due to its speed.
