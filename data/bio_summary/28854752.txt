The control diet however tended P  0.08 to a more favorable FCR compared to the 10 rye diet while the 5 rye diet resulted in an intermediate FCR.Litter quality at d 21 and 28 was negatively affected by diet inclusion level of rye.Gut MorphologyResults of the villus height crypt depth mm vil- luscrypt ratio area of villi covered by goblet cells  number of goblet cells per villi and the surface of the goblet cells mm2 of the jejunum at d 14 21 and 28 are presented in Table .

Broilers fed the 10 rye diet control showed a decreased BW and BWG between 15 and 21 d compared to the 5 rye diet whereas the 0rye diet was intermediate.

From d 14 to 21 increase in villus height of broilers fed the 5 and 10 rye diet was more compared to broilers fed the 0 rye diet result- ing in a numerical higher villus height for the broilers fed the 10 rye diet P  0.11.

At d 21 crypt depth of broilers fed the 10 rye diet tended P  0.07 to increase compared to birds fed control diet while the birds fed the 5 rye diet showed an intermediate result.

In a study of Misir and Marquardt  relative improvement of perfor- mance in broilers was higher if antibiotics were added to a rye-based diet compared to antibiotic supplemen- tation to a control diet indicating that the microbiota played a larger role in birds fed the rye-based diets.

FCR however was higher for the broilers fed the 10 rye diet compared to the other treatments whereas FCR was similar for the 0 rye and 5 rye diet.

Be- tween 22 and 28 d BWG FI and mortality were not sig- nificantly affected by dietary treatment although FCR was higher for the broilers fed the 10 rye diet com- pared to the 0 and 5 rye diet.

Although all birds were fed the same standard diet during the starter period villus height at d 14 was highest in the broilers fed the 0 rye diet compared to the diets with 5 or 10 rye inclusion during the grower period.

Between 21 and 28 d of age crypt depth de- creased more in broilers fed the 10 rye diet compared to birds fed the 0 rye and 5 rye diet.

Compared to the birds on the 5 rye diet at d 21 12 genes of the jejunal mucosa were down- regulated in the birds fed the 10 rye diet whereas 8 genes were up-regulated.
