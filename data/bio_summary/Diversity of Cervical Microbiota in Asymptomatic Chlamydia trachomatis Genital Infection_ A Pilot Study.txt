therefore here we present a pilot study aiming to characterize through the metagenomic analysis of sequenced 16s rrna gene amplicons the cervical microbiota from reproductive age women with asymptomatic c. trachomatis infection.materials and methodsstudy design and sample collectionfrom may to september 2016 45 consecutive women of italian origin attending the department of gynaecology obstetrics and urology at sapienza university of rome for regular check-ups were enrolled in this study.all women were not pregnant of reproductive age and regularly menstruating.

specifically l. crispatus or l. gasseri were the predominant species in the majority of healthy women 86 whereas in the remaining women lactobacillus iners was the predominant species figures 1 2.cervical samples from c. trachomatis positive women showed a decrease in the phylum firmicutes median relative abundance 60.2 as compared to 97.9 in healthy controls and an increase in the phyla actinobacteria median relative abundance 16.1 as compared to 0.09 in healthy controls.amongst the firmicutes lactobacillus spp.

2015. c. trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and it is responsible for cervicitis salpingitis and endometritis world health organization 2012. in particular it has been observed that women with bv may be at a higher riskfor c. trachomatis cervicitis as suggested by a high nugent score 7 in 85 of c. trachomatis infected women yoshimura et al.

amongst the latter 15 women were positive to other sexually transmitted infections stis and hence were excluded from further analysis whereas the remaining 20 were defined as healthy controls.all 30 samples underwent 16s rrna amplicon-based microbiome analysis and 16 samples were excluded from downstream analysis due to a number of reads 100.overall the cervical microbiome analysis was performed on 14 cervical samples from 7 c. trachomatis positive women and 7 healthy controls.

belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes was increased as well with a median relative abundance of 0.5 and 0.0001 in chlamydia group and healthy controls respectively.lastly the proportion of strict andor facultative anaerobes was much higher in c. trachomatis positive women median relative abundance 39.8 as compared to healthy controls median relative abundance 0.6.however on phylum class order family genus and otu levels no statistically significant differences were observed between chlamydia-positive patients and healthy controls.alpha and beta diversity analysesalpha diversity analysis showed that c. trachomatis genital infection was significantly associated to an increased diversity of the cervical microbiota as evidenced by shannon's diversity index and shannon's evenness figures 3ab p  0.031 and p  0.026 respectively.in beta diversity analysis cervical samples from healthy controls showed a tendency toward a statistically significant clustering as compared to c. trachomatis positive women in weighted unifrac analysis p  0.0027 suggesting shifts in relative taxa abundance.

2016. of note in our study 43 of c. trachomatis positive women was affected by bv and 67 of them had complex cervical microbial communities characterized by a greater species diversity and a very low abundance oflactobacillus species 1.concerning the structure of the microbial communities it emerged from the weighted unifrac analysis a higher inter-individual variability in c. trachomatis-positive women as compared to healthy controls suggesting that a unique cervical microbial profile associated to c. trachomatis genital infectioncould not be determined.

iners was present in a higher number in c. trachomatis positive women than in healthy controls and this finding is in accordance with previous studies showing that c. trachomatis positive women were more likely to have a microbiota dominated by l. iners ma et al.
