it has also been suggested that the effects of chemicals on gut microbiota leading to a disturbed host-microbiota relationship and consequently a state of chronic low-grade inflammation may be one of the mechanisms contributing to disease initiation and progression .gut health effects of food additives and contaminantsmounting evidence indicates that various chemicals including some food additives and contaminants may increase the intestinal permeability andor interfere with gut microbiota.

studies suggest that some direct food additives but also some food contaminants such as pesticide residues and substances migrating from food contact materials fcms may adversely affect the gut barrier or gut microbiota.

on the other hand several charged ionic surfactants tested showed no effect on p-gp activity .in addition to the mentioned direct food additives many more surfactants may appear as indirect food additives in fcms  both in the u.s. according to a recent publication compiling infor- mation from several food-relevant databases  and in the eu as judged by their presence on annex i of the fcm plastics regulation eu 102011  on the list of substances used in non-plastics fcm manufacture compiled by the efsa sci- entific cooperation esco group  or in the facet database from flavourings additives and food contact materials exposure task facet project which summarizes information on chemical use in fcm manufacture .examples of such substances include the non-ionic surfactants nonylphenol ethoxylates a and cationic surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  or benzalkonium chloride  .

another important source of food contaminants receiving less attention so far in this regard is the heterogeneous group of food contact chemicals fccs that can migrate from various food contact materials fcms and articles fcas into food during the production transport processing storage packing preparation and serving .

given their widespread occurrence in commonly consumed foods the shifted baseline of permeation capacity may need to be considered when developing models for characterizing uptake ki- netics and internal exposure to indirect food additives and food contaminants or when defining the safe oral intake dose.

recently emulsifiers in food have been discussed by the emerging risks exchange network eren of the european food safety authority efsa .examples of surfactants allowed as direct food additives that were shown to interfere with intestinal permeability include the anionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate   and non-ionic surfactants such as sucrose monoester fatty acids and polysorbates   .

the fungi-derived chitosan used for wine fining has a generally recognized as safe gras status confirmed by the u.s. food and drug administration fda gras notice 000397. on the other hand several notifica- tions of gras status for shrimp-derived chitosan the main type of commercially available chitosan to be used as a direct food additive have been withdrawn by the notifiers before any decision had been made by the fda gras notices 000073 000170 and 000443. however the lack of an official recognition of the proposed gras status of shrimp-derived chitosan by the fda does not necessarily mean that the substance is not being used in the food industry .nanoparticles have one or several dimensions in the nm rangedetermining their unique physico-chemical properties.

chronic activation of the immune system may also result in the development of an autoimmune disease   and prolonged state of low-grade inflammation may also contribute to tumorigenesis .indeed the disruption of the gut barrier has been suggested toplay a prominent role in the etiology of various non-communicablediseases some of which are currently on the rise  .

since an important consequence of these interactions may be the increased risk of various non-communicable diseases of public concern it may be appropriate to include the consideration of potential gut effects in the regular risk assessment performed for fccs and fcms.

in addition immune system-related effects may need to be assessed for some fcms including for example those capable of releasing nanoparticles or high mw oligomers for further discus- sion on the latter see section .it should be noted that some substances or even classes ofsubstances may be able to interfere with multiple gut health- related aspects covering intestinal permeability gut microbiota and immune responses.

among the polysiloxane oligomers migrating from silicone baking moulds 50e95 of all migrating species were larger than 1000 da  and polyadipate-based plasticizers may contain 65e95 of species larger than 1000 da .as will be reviewed next given the evidence demonstrating thatthe intestinal barrier is not 100 impermeable to high mw com- pounds and considering that permeability can be further increased by a variety of endogenous and exogenous factors it appearsprudent to question whether the 1000 da cut-off approach remains scientifically justified and sufficiently protective of public health.uptake of high mw compounds in the gut does existas reviewed in section  intestinal uptake of high mw sub- stances may occur through both transcellular and paracellular routes see section .

which toxicological effects may be elicited by the high mw compounds entering the organism since galt the immune system of the gut would be the first to interact with these com- pounds the immediate question becomes whether the high mw compounds originating from fcms may be able to trigger inflam- mation andor any adverse immunogenic or antigenic responses.

gut health may also be affected by food con- taminants including some pesticide residues mycotoxins and metals  .
