Caprolactam is authorized as a monomer of nylon-6 plastics and as plastic FCM additive with a specific migration limit SML of 15 mgkg established in the EU.Table 1Selected examples of direct and indirect food additives with potential effects in the gut.Chemical typeChemical nameCASLegal statusPotential effects in the gut on Would itReferencesUSEUPerme-ability ABCMXRactivityGut microbiota Immuneresponsessurfactant non-ionic sucrose fatty acid esters HLB-16977019-37-6 GDY sucrose monolaurate25339-99-5polysorbate 20 or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate or Tween 20polysorbate 80 or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate or Tween 809005-64-5DFGI UEFa Y9005-65-6DFIC UEFa Yyesyes glyceryl monooleate25496-72-4DFGI EFaY glyceryl monostearate31566-31-1FGIEFapolyoxyethylene40 monostearate9004-99-3DEFaYsufactant anionicsodium lauryl sulfate or sodium dodecyl sulfate 151-21-3DFGI EFa4 surfactant cationicbenzalkonium chloride68424-85-1IFahexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or cetrimonium bromide57-09-0IFa4N-containing ringcaprolactam105-60-2DFGUEFa N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone872-50-4IUEFapiperazine110-85-0DFGI EFaphenothiazine94-84-2IFapolymershrimp-derived chitosan9012-76-4eeyesyescarboxymethyl cellulose900-11-7DFGI UEFa yesyes nanoparticlesilver nanoparticleseIeYyesyes carbon nanotubes308068-56-6 eeYyestitanium dioxide E 171 up to 36 may be nanosized 100 nm13463-67-7DICP UEFa yesyesphenolbisphenol A80-05-7IUEFa YYyesyesphthalatediethyl phthalate84-66-2IEFayes parabenmethyl paraben99-76-3GUEFaAbbreviations D direct food additive according to Pew list F flavor according to Pew list G GRAS according to Pew list I indirect food additive according to Pew list C food color according to Pew list P previously used before 1958 according to Pew list U on the Union lists of plastic FCM regulation EU 102011 E on the ESCO list Fa in the FACET database for FCMs  increased Y decreased 4 no effect  no information.From FCMs obtained in Europe and Japan respectively caprolactam migrated into foods at concentrations up to 13 mgkg   and into food simulants at concentrations up to 38 mgkg .

It has also been suggested that the effects of chemicals on gut microbiota leading to a disturbed host-microbiota relationship and consequently a state of chronic low-grade inflammation may be one of the mechanisms contributing to disease initiation and progression .Gut health effects of food additives and contaminantsMounting evidence indicates that various chemicals including some food additives and contaminants may increase the intestinal permeability andor interfere with gut microbiota.

Studies suggest that some direct food additives but also some food contaminants such as pesticide residues and substances migrating from food contact materials FCMs may adversely affect the gut barrier or gut microbiota.

On the other hand several charged ionic surfactants tested showed no effect on P-gp activity .In addition to the mentioned direct food additives many more surfactants may appear as indirect food additives in FCMs  both in the U.S. according to a recent publication compiling infor- mation from several food-relevant databases  and in the EU as judged by their presence on Annex I of the FCM plastics regulation EU 102011  on the list of substances used in non-plastics FCM manufacture compiled by the EFSA Sci- entific Cooperation ESCO group  or in the FACET database from Flavourings Additives and food Contact materials Exposure Task FACET project which summarizes information on chemical use in FCM manufacture .Examples of such substances include the non-ionic surfactants nonylphenol ethoxylates a and cationic surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  or benzalkonium chloride  .

Another important source of food contaminants receiving less attention so far in this regard is the heterogeneous group of food contact chemicals FCCs that can migrate from various food contact materials FCMs and articles FCAs into food during the production transport processing storage packing preparation and serving .

Given their widespread occurrence in commonly consumed foods the shifted baseline of permeation capacity may need to be considered when developing models for characterizing uptake ki- netics and internal exposure to indirect food additives and food contaminants or when defining the safe oral intake dose.

Chronic activation of the immune system may also result in the development of an autoimmune disease   and prolonged state of low-grade inflammation may also contribute to tumorigenesis .Indeed the disruption of the gut barrier has been suggested toplay a prominent role in the etiology of various non-communicablediseases some of which are currently on the rise  .

Since an important consequence of these interactions may be the increased risk of various non-communicable diseases of public concern it may be appropriate to include the consideration of potential gut effects in the regular risk assessment performed for FCCs and FCMs.

In addition immune system-related effects may need to be assessed for some FCMs including for example those capable of releasing nanoparticles or high Mw oligomers for further discus- sion on the latter see Section .It should be noted that some substances or even classes ofsubstances may be able to interfere with multiple gut health- related aspects covering intestinal permeability gut microbiota and immune responses.
