Caprolactam is authorized as a monomer of nylon-6 plastics and as plastic FCM additive with a specific migration limit SML of 15 mgkg established in the EU.Table 1Selected examples of direct and indirect food additives with potential effects in the gut.Chemical typeChemical nameCASLegal statusPotential effects in the gut on Would itReferencesUSEUPerme-ability ABCMXRactivityGut microbiota Immuneresponsessurfactant non-ionic sucrose fatty acid esters HLB-16977019-37-6 GDY sucrose monolaurate25339-99-5polysorbate 20 or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate or Tween 20polysorbate 80 or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate or Tween 809005-64-5DFGI UEFa Y9005-65-6DFIC UEFa Yyesyes glyceryl monooleate25496-72-4DFGI EFaY glyceryl monostearate31566-31-1FGIEFapolyoxyethylene40 monostearate9004-99-3DEFaYsufactant anionicsodium lauryl sulfate or sodium dodecyl sulfate 151-21-3DFGI EFa4 surfactant cationicbenzalkonium chloride68424-85-1IFahexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or cetrimonium bromide57-09-0IFa4N-containing ringcaprolactam105-60-2DFGUEFa N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone872-50-4IUEFapiperazine110-85-0DFGI EFaphenothiazine94-84-2IFapolymershrimp-derived chitosan9012-76-4eeyesyescarboxymethyl cellulose900-11-7DFGI UEFa yesyes nanoparticlesilver nanoparticleseIeYyesyes carbon nanotubes308068-56-6 eeYyestitanium dioxide E 171 up to 36 may be nanosized 100 nm13463-67-7DICP UEFa yesyesphenolbisphenol A80-05-7IUEFa YYyesyesphthalatediethyl phthalate84-66-2IEFayes parabenmethyl paraben99-76-3GUEFaAbbreviations D direct food additive according to Pew list F flavor according to Pew list G GRAS according to Pew list I indirect food additive according to Pew list C food color according to Pew list P previously used before 1958 according to Pew list U on the Union lists of plastic FCM regulation EU 102011 E on the ESCO list Fa in the FACET database for FCMs  increased Y decreased 4 no effect  no information.From FCMs obtained in Europe and Japan respectively caprolactam migrated into foods at concentrations up to 13 mgkg   and into food simulants at concentrations up to 38 mgkg .

Another important source of food contaminants receiving less attention so far in this regard is the heterogeneous group of food contact chemicals FCCs that can migrate from various food contact materials FCMs and articles FCAs into food during the production transport processing storage packing preparation and serving .

Studies suggest that some direct food additives but also some food contaminants such as pesticide residues and substances migrating from food contact materials FCMs may adversely affect the gut barrier or gut microbiota.

On the other hand several charged ionic surfactants tested showed no effect on P-gp activity .In addition to the mentioned direct food additives many more surfactants may appear as indirect food additives in FCMs  both in the U.S. according to a recent publication compiling infor- mation from several food-relevant databases  and in the EU as judged by their presence on Annex I of the FCM plastics regulation EU 102011  on the list of substances used in non-plastics FCM manufacture compiled by the EFSA Sci- entific Cooperation ESCO group  or in the FACET database from Flavourings Additives and food Contact materials Exposure Task FACET project which summarizes information on chemical use in FCM manufacture .Examples of such substances include the non-ionic surfactants nonylphenol ethoxylates a and cationic surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  or benzalkonium chloride  .

The influence of environmental factors including chemical exposures is being increasingly recognized as well.Several types of food ingredients and direct food additives have been demonstrated or suggested to affect gut physiology and health  .

Furthermore it has been suggested that exposures to environmental chemicals many of them often present in food are likely to be among the significant contributors to this concerning development as will be discussed in the next subsections.Intestinal permeability gut microbiota and immune responsesGut lumen contains a complex mixture of chemical substances which are delivered with food secreted by the body's glands or generated by gut microbiota see .

These include the clearly GI-related irritable bowel syndrome IBS  and inflammatory bowel disease IBD a general term covering two conditions Crohn's dis- ease and ulcerative colitis   celiac disease   and various other food intolerances and food allergies  but also non-alcoholic fatty liver disease   and autoimmune diseases like type I diabetes   or inflammatory joint ailments  and even mental disorders .Deregulation of gut microbiota or of its communication with the immune system across the gut barrier has also been linked to an increased risk of several non-communicable diseases including IBD allergy obesity and diabetes  .

It has also been suggested that the effects of chemicals on gut microbiota leading to a disturbed host-microbiota relationship and consequently a state of chronic low-grade inflammation may be one of the mechanisms contributing to disease initiation and progression .Gut health effects of food additives and contaminantsMounting evidence indicates that various chemicals including some food additives and contaminants may increase the intestinal permeability andor interfere with gut microbiota.

Recently emulsifiers in food have been discussed by the Emerging Risks Exchange Network EREN of the European Food Safety Authority EFSA .Examples of surfactants allowed as direct food additives that were shown to interfere with intestinal permeability include the anionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate   and non-ionic surfactants such as sucrose monoester fatty acids and polysorbates   .

Food-relevant examples include the direct food additive sodium carboxymethylcellulose  and one type of indirect food additives polyethylene oxide-b- polypropylene oxide-b-polyethylene oxide PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymers also called poloxamers or Pluronicr used for example in sanitizing solutions .
