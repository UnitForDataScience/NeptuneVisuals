have proposed that glucose uptake by sglt1 can stimulate the release of glp-1 by l-cells and gip by k- cells given that the use of phlorizin a competitive blocker of sodium-glucose transporters suppresses incretin secretion.once in the enterocytes glucose is moved to the interstitial space by the basolateral glucose transporter glut 2 a bi- directional transporter moving glucose outside or inside the intestinal epithelial cells depending on the glucose gradient.the jejunal infusion of glucose in normal rats reduces he- patic glucose production an effect that is reversed by phlorizin blockade of sodium-glucose transporters located in the mucosa of the small intestine .

hypotheses concerning the mechanism of action of metabolic surgery for diabetes remis- sion vary from theories focusing on jejunal nutrient sensing to incretin action to the blunted secretion of putative insulin resistance hormones to changes in the microbiota.summary whatever the mechanism metabolic surgery has the undoubted merit of exposing the central role of the small intestine in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.keywords bariatric surgery .

glp-1 receptor knockout mice glp- 1r-- show glucose intolerance and reduced insulin secre- tion after a glucose load .in patients with t2d glp-1 improves both early and late phases of the insulin response to glucose and suppresses glu- cagon secretion by the pancreatic a-cells leading to reduced endogenous glucose production from the liver.similarly to glp-1 gip enhances intracellular cyclic amp generation and inhibits atp-sensitive k channels thereby increasing intracellular ca levels with consequent stimula- tion of insulin secretion.

indeed the designation of metabolic surgery was previously used by buchwald and varco  for some operations like the portal diversion to improve glycogen storage diseases or the partial ileal bypass for hyperlipidemia.in view of the weight independent effects of some types of gastrointestinal surgery for obesity rubino  proposed to use metabolic surgery not only for uncontrolled t2d but also for patients with the metabolic syndrome non-alcoholic steatohepatitis nash and increased cardiovascular risk pre- suming a neuroendocrine mechanism of action for this surgery.

at the moment the term metabolic surgery is used to underline the fact that this type of surgery is performed specifically to treat diabetes and its metabolic complications such as hyperlipidemia.recent findings randomized controlled studies have recent- ly supported the use of bariatric surgery and in particular of roux-en-y gastric bypass rygb and biliopancreatic diver- sion bpd as an effective treatment for decompensated t2d.

insulin secretion is increased after rygb but it is de- creased after bpd as a consequence of the net improvementin insulin sensitivity .it is interesting to note that rygb exerts its main effect in inducing diabetes remission through the reduction of hepatic glucose production  and increased insulin secretion while bpd acts essentially by normalizing insulin sensitivity the first phase insulin secretion is promptly normalized after bpd  whereas it is significantly improved but does not return to normality after rygb .the very-low calorie diet vlcd undergone in the weeks immediately following metabolic surgery might indeed con- tribute to remove the glucotoxicity and lipotoxicty present in diabetes.

the diabetes surgery summit consensus conference recommendations for the evaluation and use of gastrointestinal surgery to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

next we will discuss the effects of bariatric surgery on these glucose disposal steps.gastric emptyinggastric emptying accounting for about 35 of the variance of plasma glucose concentration at the peak after an ogtt  is regulated by the opening and closure of the pylorus that prevents the food mixed with gastric juices to enter the duo- denum during mixing and crushing.

in fact a 6-week energy-restricted high- protein diet followed by a 6-week weight-maintenance diet reduced adipose tissue and systemic inflammation in over- weight or obese individuals by correcting a putative loss of richness in low gene-count individuals .although it is possible that gut microbiota changes after bariatric surgery play a role in the improvement of glycemic control and amelioration of the insulin resistance status further research is necessary to determine the degree to which such changes account for the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery.conclusionsthe small intestine exerts a primary role in glucose homeo- stasis as the jejunum senses the nutrients and regulates hepat- ic glucose production and the entire small gut secretes both glp-1 and gip thereby enhancing insulin secretion.

other studies highlight the role of decreased ghrelin secretion as a possible mechanism of action of metabolic surgery .however vertical sg is effective in improving glucose tolerance in both wild-type and ghrelin knockout mice when exposed to a high-fat diet for 10 weeks before surgery .

obesityintroductionin the last few years a great deal of attention has been focused on the effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes remission and changes in glucose homeostasis.

this shows that at least in rodents ghrelin does not play a key role in the remission of diabetes that follows bariatric surgery but it is rather an epiphenomenon related to the partial gastrectomy.gut microbiota and glucose metabolismthe human gut microbiome is composed of more than 1012 cells per gram of feces the majority of which are prokariotes.

effect of weight loss by gastric bypass surgery versus hypocaloric diet on glucose and incretin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

the idea of a surgical treatment of obesity developed in the early 1950s fortuitously from the observation that patients that underwent gastrointestinal resec- tions for various reasons were likely to lose weight.an international consensus conference held in rome in 2007 - the diabetes surgery summit--underlined the need to use the adjective metabolic instead of bariatric in order to highlight the efficacy of bariatric surgery from the metabol- ic point of view even in the absence of weight reduction .

compared rygb with intensive lifestyle and medical intervention ilmi in t2dm patients with a bmi 35 kgm2 and found that diabetes remission hba1c 6.0 42.1 mmolmol off all diabetes medicines at 1 year was achieved in 60.0 of rygb and in 5.9 of ilmi p  0.002.there rcts show that bariatricmetabolic surgery is indeed a suitable option to treat patients with uncontrolled t2dm and this independently of their baseline bmi.surgical proceduresthe three major bariatric surgical procedures rygb bpd and sleeve gastrectomy sg are described below.
