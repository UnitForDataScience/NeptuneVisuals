For V. parvula plasmid transformations the structure of the transforming DNA may be an additional contributing factor to its much lower efficiency as most plasmid DNA is circular whereas PCR products and gDNA are both linear.Given the apparent poor transformability of plasmid DNA in V. parvula Figure 3B we suspect that our original lack of observable transformants in V. atypica and V. dispar is probably a consequence of using pBSJL1 for competence screening since both species likely encode the same DNA uptake machinery as V. parvula Figure 4.

2014 six are typically found in the oral cavities of humans V. atypica V. dispar V. parvula V. denticariosi V. rogosae and V. tobetsuensis where they comprise significant fractions of the oral flora found within supra- and subgingival dental plaque as well as on the oral mucosa Aas et al.

To the best of our knowledge this study is the first demonstration of natural competence and targeted allelic exchange mutagenesis within the entire Veillonellaceae family and demonstrates a simple and rapid method to study Veillonella genetics.Keywords oral bacteria natural competence Veillonella natural transformation type II secretion DNA uptake type IV piliINTRODUCTIONOf the 13 species in the genus Veillonella Aujoulat et al.

While this strain of V. parvula proved to be resistant to electrotransformation with all other sources of DNA this was not the case for the V. atypica clinical isolate OK5 which was later used to develop the first Veillonella genetic system Liu et al.

Interestingly V. parvula natural competence was found to exhibit a clear hierarchy of preference for different sources of DNA plasmid  PCR product  genomic DNA which is unlike most naturally competent species.

Thus for unknown reasons V. parvula natural competence exhibits a clear hierarchy of preference for the sourcetype of DNA with plasmids being the least efficiently transformed and genomic DNA being the most efficient.Putative Natural Competence Loci Are Widely Encoded in the Veillonellaceae FamilyGiven the relatively low efficiency of plasmid transformations inV.

Since construct design did not appear to be the primary source of the V. parvula preference for genomic DNA we were next interested to test the role of DNA methylation.

Of the 43unique isolates we obtained multiple strains of the three most common Veillonella species found in dental plaque V. atypica dispar and parvula as well as a lone isolate of the less common species V. denticariosi Table 2.

Data are expressed as the average and standard deviations of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.Transformation of V. parvula Strains with Genomic DNAThe same natural transformation protocol described for pBSJL1 transformation was used to transform a panel of wild-type V.parvula strains with 500 ng genomic DNA derived from a tetracycline resistant competence locus deletion mutant of strain SKV38.

These studies have provided some of the first insights into Veillonella genetics and further demonstrated the feasibility of Veillonella genetic research.Encouraged by these studies we were curious whether the Veillonella genetic system could be further improved using natural competence rather than electrotransformation.
