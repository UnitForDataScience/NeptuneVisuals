However following long-term antibiotic administrating the body adjusted the immune system improved the body's immune function which made the immune system obtain a new immune balance.

In fact both the immune response and immune homeostasis are affected by gut microbiota.

This study helps our understanding of the influences of long-term antibiotic exposure on host gut microbiota and immune system.ResultsDynamic changes of intestinal microbiota in ceftriaxone-treated mice based on DGGE finger- print.

Along similar lines mouse models also showed that treatment with ampicillin clindamycin or vanco- mycin induced microbiota dysbiosis.The commensal gut microbiota has a profound effect on immune system.

Our previous study showed that short term for 7 days use of ceftriaxone-induced microbiota dysbiosis resulted in decreased SIgA secretion and increased inflammatory cytokines levels.It is clear that antibiotics-induced microbiota dysbiosis disrupts the immune system.

Not only the immune defense long term ceftriaxone administration also affected immune regulation.

Our results showed that SIgA secretion in ceftriaxone treated mice decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner when compared with control mice throughout the experiment which suggested a significant reduction in the protective ability of the intestinal mucosa against exogenous bacterial infections.Long term antibiotic administration affected both the immune defense and the immune regulation.

Long term ceftriaxone administration resulting in a new balance of Th1 and Th2.The CD4CD8 ratio is considered a marker for both immune senescence and immune activation.

Long term ceftriaxone administration induced a reduction in commensal bacterium and overgrowth of antibiotic resistant bacterium which had a great impact on both local immune response and systemic immune response.

Except for immune response long term ceftriaxone administration also affected immune regulation.
