The in vitro chemostat system used here may be a suitable alternative tool for the study of enterotype function.In order to build an in vitro model to further evaluate the nutritional requirements for different enterotypes and to generate alternative donor bacterial communities for fecal transplantation the stability and culturability of Chinese enterotypes were investigated in the current study.1State Key Laboratory of Breeding Base for Zhejiang Sustainable Pest and Key Laboratory for Food Microbial Technology of Zhejiang Province Institute of Plant Protection and Microbiology Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences 198 Shiqiao Road Hangzhou Zhejiang 310021 P. R. China.

The bacterial percentage of original fecal samples and fermentation samples was used for LefSe analysis.

These were recognized as the Prevotella enterotype.To verify the existence of gut microbial enterotypes in healthy Chinese people three fecal samples were extracted at another laboratory and sent for sequencing using the 16S rRNA gene V4 region and Hiseq platform.

Although some studies have shown that the gut bacterial community becomes stable after the host reaches adulthood  Knights et al.

Whether Prevotella enterotypes also exist in healthy Chinese people needs further study.De Filippo et al.

Prevotella is the major bacterial genus in these two samples and the similarity between these two columns was high at 0.927.Simulated cultures of the Chinese gut microbial enterotypes.

According to previous work bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified from extracted DNA using barcoded primers 338F 5'-ACT CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC A-3' with 806R 5'-GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-3' 515F5'-GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-3' with 806R 5'-GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-3'or 515F with 907R 5'-CCG TCA ATT CMT TTR AGT TT-3'.Most next-generation sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq.

The bacterial community of the Bacteroides enterotype was simulated well in vitro independent of the original enterotypes.Materials and MethodsOrigin of human fecal samples.

Comparisons of the taxonomic differences in sequences were generated by different labs the bacterial genomic DNA of three fecal samples was extracted at Beijing and Hangzhou by different students and were sent for sequencing on a Hiseq platform at Novogene Beijing China and MiSeq platform at Majorbio Shanghai China individually.

Ori original fecal sample VI and XP fermentation products using VI and XP culture media respectively.in children changes the gut bacterial community long-term.
