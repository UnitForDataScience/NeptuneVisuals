The presence of persisters is thought to drive the long course of treatment for TB  therefore isolation of compounds that inhibit DosRST- dependent adaptation may identify new antivirulence therapies targeting the drug-tolerant persister population.Similar to the approach described above to discover inhibitors of the PhoPR regulon a reporter-based HTS was conducted to find inhibitors of the DosRST regulon.

Antivirulence compounds sometimes referred to as anti-infective compounds are an alternative approach to traditional therapeutic1Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Michigan State University East Lansing MI 48824 USACorrespondence R.B.

HTS of a proprietary library of 340000 compounds using J774 macrophages infected with an Mtb fluorescent reporter identified 727TDDIF1359 compounds that inhibit intracellular survival with an IC50 value of 50 mM .

In this screen compounds that inhibited the production of GFP fluorescence while leaving the growth of Mtb relatively unaffected were hypothesized to be putative inhibitors of PhoPR signaling.

Taken together the T3SS ATPase domain of YscN provides an attractive target for development of small-molecule inhibitors that could broadly abrograte secretion of type III effector proteins.The ZINC database of commercially available compounds was screened computationally using a structure-guided rational design scheme against the active site of YscN .

In addition to distinguish potential ESX-1 inhibitors from compounds generally toxic to bacterial growth Mtb cultures were counter-screened for inhibition of growth in vitro.

Using the hypoxic shiftdown model of Mtb persistence  the newly discovered inhibitors were shown to reduce Mtb survival by 50 following 10 days of incubation with the inhibitors under NRP-inducing conditions.

However resistance to virstatin has been demonstrated suggesting that new inhibitors with alternative targets will be useful .Toxtazins A B and B' were identified in a whole-cell screen for inhibitors of ToxT expression  .

Thus inhibitors of activating steps in the process of releasing GTD may lead to reduced toxicity and better patient outcomes from CDI.A targeted HTS using a fluorescent reporter of CPD activity identified 44 potential inhibitors of the protease .

The topic of how pathogens adapt their metabolism to intracellular environments and specialized approaches to effectively acquire metabolites necessary to promote disease has been recently reviewed  and thus this review will focus specifically on a recent study of inhibitors of Mtb cholesterol metabolism.819TDDIFV-13-009920 V-13-011503 and V-13-012725Whole-cell phenotypic screens for inhibitors of metabolic requirements in vivo often suffer from an inability to adequately recapitulate the environment that the pathogen encounters within the host.
