Available strategies for nutritional interventions and optimisation of LBW infants including patterns of nutrition supply macronutrient proportion supplementation of amino acids and their derivatives fatty acids nucleotides vitamins minerals as well as hormone and microbiota manipulators were reviewed with an aim to provide new insights into the advancements of formulas and human-milk fortifiers.Key words Low birth weight Infants Growth Metabolic syndrome Nutritional supportAccording to the WHO infants with a birth weight 2500 g irrespective of gestation are defined as low birth weight LBW.

Because of the ethical issues involved animal models have been widely used to investigate the physiological differences between LBW offspring and normal ones as well as the nutritional support strategies.In this review we will focus on discussing the physiologicaldifferences related to provision and digestion of nutrientsbetween LBW infants and normal infants.

Nutrition for low birth weight infants1391of catch-up growth of LBW infants during the neonatal period-.Normally catch-up growth in LBW infants is achieved by overnutrition compensation and it is postulated to erase the growth deficit generated during the fetal period.

In spite of these data it is still difficult to recommend either method of gavage feeding and more trials in LBW infants or animals are needed to evaluate the benefits and side effects of both methods.MacronutrientsLBW infants are generally fed high-proteinenergy formulas to improve their growth rates and N retention7-.

Considering the specific physiological status of LBW infants nutritional intervention and optimisation during early life merit further attention.

In this review the physiological and metabolic defects of LBW infants were summarised from a nutritional perspective.

Although great efforts have been put into nutritional management and clinical support for pregnant women LBW infants still account for about 15  of newborns.

Because of improper nutritional provision during the fetal period a critical period according to the nutritional programming theory LBW infants not only show growth failure during the neonatal period but also lifelong metabolic disturbance-.

Therefore nutritional intervention of LBW infants during their neonatal stage has aroused great attention in recent years.
