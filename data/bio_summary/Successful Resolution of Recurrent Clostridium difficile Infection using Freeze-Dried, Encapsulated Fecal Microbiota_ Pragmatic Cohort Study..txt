In addition little is known about microbiome changes that follow capsule FMT.Staley et al.Page 3We sought to develop the next-generation form of encapsulated FMT using a freeze-dried preparation of microbiota that could tolerate a range of temperatures to allow ease of handling and satisfy the following conditions i the freeze-drying procedure should preserve viability and diversity of the entire taxonomic spectrum of microbiota ii the resulting material should have physicochemical properties that enable standardized encapsulation iii the encapsulation procedure should not compromise the viability of microbiota and iv the microbiota should engraft into the colon and successfully treat R- CDI.

In addition the membrane integrity assay showed the viability of the fresh material was nearly indistinguishable compared to lyophilized fecal microbiota 60 and 56 intact cells respectively.Consequently 5 trehalose was chosen as our standard cryoprotectant in the rest of the study.Staley et al.Page 7Since flexibility in storage and handling conditions is an important issue in clinical care delivery we tested the stability of freeze-dried microbiota at different temperatures.Membrane integrity of freeze-dried microbiota remained intact after 96 h of storage at room temperature 4 and -20 degC Supplementary Table 2.

We also treated a cohort of R-CDI patients with a range of doses of encapsulated microbiota and analyzed the associated changes in the fecal microbiome of the recipients.RESULTS--The optimized lyophilized preparation satisfied all our preset goals for physicochemical properties encapsulation ease stability at different temperatures and microbiota viability in vitro and in vivo germ-free mice.

Species and genus level resolution analysis of gut microbiota in Clostridium difficile patients following fecal microbiota transplantation.

The success rate in breaking the cycle of CDI recurrence for the lowest dosage of microbiota was 93.3 2830 patients and 96.2 2526 for patients for whom the capsule treatment was their first FMT.

Prompt and stable engraftment of all bacterial phyla was evident for both frozen and freeze-dried treatment groups as discussed in detail in Supplementary Results Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.Clinical performance of capsule FMTThe basic characteristics of the patients in this clinical cohort were comparable to patients without underlying inflammatory bowel disease offered FMT in our program Table 1 8. these patients had an average of 4-5 episodes of CDI since the initial infection and failed all reasonable attempts at breaking the cycle of R-CDI by using antibiotics alone including an extended course of tapered vancomycin per inclusion criteria.The clinical capsule FMT protocol evolved over the course of the program experience.

Approximately a third of patients reported some bowel movement irregularity bloating and flatulence in the initial weeks following capsule FMT.Changes in the fecal microbiome following FMTGiven the inherent microbiome complexity expected in patients with history of prior FMT we limited the characterization of the fecal microbiome to samples obtained from patients for whom the capsule treatment was their first FMT.

We sought to develop a stable freeze-dried encapsulated preparation of standardized fecal microbiota that can be used for FMT with ease and convenience in clinical practice and research.METHODS--We systematically developed a lyophilization protocol that preserved the viability of bacteria across the taxonomic spectrum found in fecal microbiota and yielded physicochemicalCorrespondence Alexander Khoruts MD University of Minnesota Professor of Medicine 2101 6th Street S.E.

The simplest protocol using the lowest dose 2.1-2.5x1011 bacteria in 2-3 capsules without any colon purgative performed equally well in terms of clinical outcomes and microbiota engraftment.CONCLUSIONS--A single administration of encapsulated freeze-dried fecal microbiota from a healthy donor was highly successful in treating antibiotic-refractory R-CDI syndrome.INTRODUCTIONWidespread use of antimicrobial drugs over many decades in medicine and agriculture has resulted in the emergence of increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant pathogens which constitute one of the most urgent growing threats in modern healthcare 12.

Restoration of the gut microbial community structure and function via fecal microbiota transplantation FMT--transplantation of the gut microbial community from healthy donor stool--has emerged as a highly effective treatment of refractory R-CDI 56.FMT has developed rapidly over the last several years from a crude procedure involving different routes of administration of raw stool from patient-identified donors to the use of purified and cryopreserved standardized preparations of fecal microbiota from highly selected donors 7.
