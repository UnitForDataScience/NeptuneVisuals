Our ancestors already intuited this concept based on expressions that connect emotions and the digestive sys- tem such as ''having the stomach for something or not'' or describing something immoral ignoble or revolting being ''stomach-churning''.The digestive tract also contains a vast colony of microor-ganisms living in symbiosis with us and their genome contains 100 times as many genes as the human genome.

This close relationship between the nervous and digestive systems has given rise to the concept of the ''gut-brain axis''.

Due to all of these considerations the appearance on stage of this influential actor has led to the concept of the ''gut-brain axis'' being broadened to the ''microbiota-gut-brain axis''.As in all relationships any attack on one party inevitablyaffects the others.

A new line of therapeutic options will surely open up based on the study of the microbiota-gut-brain axis such as probiotics live microorganisms that when ingested in suitable amounts may benefit the health of the consumer prebiotics com- pounds that the organism cannot digest but which have a physiological effect in the gut by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria or even antibi- otic treatments such as Minocycline.These therapeutic alternatives have already been studied in diseases that are very common in our bipolar patients such as obesity or car- diovascular complaints.It would not have been possible to develop these new theories without the technological advances already made in the 21st century as they made it possible to gain deeper knowledge about this axis.

The intestines also have an extensive neuronal network that makes broad interconnectivity possible and it interacts continuously with the central nervous system.

This microbiota accompanies us from our mother's womb Please cite this article as Salagre E Vieta E Grande I. El cerebro visceral trastorno bipolar y microbiota.

This is so to the degree that in studies of experimen- tal animals with no intestinal flora it has been shown that the microbiota is indispensible for the correct working of the immune and digestive systems as well as for suitable control of the response to stress and anxiety as well as cognitive functions such as memory.
