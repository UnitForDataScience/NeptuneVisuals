Exo  SpA or from biofilm matrix obtained from a persistent isolate in the presence or absence of 50 ugmL SpA for 2 h. Following 2 h treatment tobramycin was added to a final concentration of 1000 ugmL and biofilm was allowed to grow for an additional 24 h before imaging.

Additionally we could effectively remove SpA from our filtrates by using IgG sepharosecolumns and confirmed this using the SpA ELISA and gel electrophoresis not shown.The ability of SpA to bind to eradicated and persistent isolates from our cohort was determined using a fluorescently labeled SpA conjugate SpA-FITC in a 96-well plate assay.

Biofilms were then visualized using confocal microscopy as described above.Extraction of exopolysaccharides from biofilm matrix Exopolysaccharides were extracted from the biofilm matrix of PAO1 PA580 persistent and PA558 eradicated isolates in an adapted version ofmethods previously described.Following EPS extraction biofilms pre-formed by eradicated strains were treated with the crude EPS products with or without the addition of purified SpA.

In the absence of Psl components of S. aureus filtrates such as SpA were shown to inhibit biofilm formation as measured by crystal violet assays.They attributed this lack of attachment to binding of SpA to type 4 pili in P. aeruginosa when Psl was not present resulting in decreased attachment.

Interestingly secreted SpA has been associated with biofilm formation and S. aureus aggregation previously.The accumulation of SpA in PAO1 and Persistent isolates may led to a similar phenomenon.The present study has several limitations.

6.Therefore we looked for a potential interaction between SpAand P. aeruginosa.Given that SpA has been shown to interact with Psl we examined how eradicated and persistent isolates behaved in the presence of SpA using a Psl stain and labeled SpA antibody.

This difference in observations was likely attributable to the fact that biofilms grown on coverslips rely on initial flagella attachment whereas attachment in crystal violet assays is more dependent on type 4 pili interaction with the surface.The advantage of our current model was the ability to directly visualize the effect of these interactions once a biofilm was established.In our model once biofilm was formed in the continuous presence of S. aureus exoproducts P. aeruginosa formed dense aggregates of bacteria on the surface of coverslips.

These changes in biofilm structure only occurred after an initial period of biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa and only in wild-type PA01 and persistent isolates.

Psl is a charge-neutral polysaccharide made up of repeating pentasaccharide units and has been well described for its role in cell-cell and cell-substrate attachment adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro.- It has been previously reported that Psl production in P. aeruginosa biofilm is under temporal and spatial regulation.

described the role of Psl in the initial attachment of the biofilm monolayers followed by repression of Psl as the biofilm further develops Psl is again expressed specifically in micro-colonies.
