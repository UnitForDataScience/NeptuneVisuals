Indeed dietary ingredients are currently leading candidates in the translational pipe- line and perhaps represent the most realistic means of manipulating the gut microbiome for beneficial augmen- tation of cardiometabolic resilience.ConclusionsThe gut microbiome represents the physiological 'system' which is perhaps most readily modified by external factors such as diet   and pharmacologic applications .

For instance seminal studies on the relationship between diet gut microbiome and TMAO suggest new therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis that are gut micro- biome based    .Moreover while statin-based therapies represent the gold standard and have proven highly effective in the management of LDL-C and CVD risk there remain a subset of at-risk hyperlipidemic patients who are par- tially or entirely intolerant of this drug class.

One of the most important early clinical discoveries was that per- turbations in the gut microbiome caused by antibiotic administration during early development can have last- ing effects on both the composition and richness of the microbiome  with deleterious consequences for life- long metabolic health of the host -.

Ryan12 Catherine Stanton13 and Noel M. Caplice12BackgroundThe human metagenome consists of the host genome and a symbiont microbiome of over 10 trillion bacteria predominantly located within the host gastrointestinal tract.

Herein we examine the relationship of the gut microbiome to disease enti- ties ranging from obesity hyperlipidemia insulin resist- ance and hypertension i.e.

However bile modification by members of the gut microbiome can greatly influence the efficacy at which these compounds are reabsorbed and recycled.

Due to this central role of the gut microbiome in profoundly shaping the whole bile pool and the diversity of its profile bile acids offer a con- vincing pathway of microbe-host crosstalk in the context of overall host metabolism.

In a clinical setting bile acids may represent potential biomarkers of metabolic health and disease which are highly trackable through analytic techniques  while also providing several potentially potent pathways that may be targeted in the pursuit of novel therapeutics.Bile modulates host metabolic functionThe gut microbiome potentially represents a bounty or burden in terms of its metabolic capacity and how this impacts upon host cardiometabolic health.

Microbiome richness generally regarded as a proxy for its metabolic capabilities or functionality has in turn been shown to correlate tightly with human inflammatory and metabolic markers .Table 1 Bile acid receptors ligands and cardiometabolic physiological effectsReceptor Naturaland synthetic ligandsSerum concen- tration nM Relative potencyReported physiological effects AdiposityglucosemetabolismLipid metabo- lismVascular diseaseHF and HTNFXRCDCA380 BAT  Glucose TAG  RCT  BP CA440DCA320LCA LODUDCA43 Insulin WAY-362450NA--TAG Cholesterol  Atherosclero- - sis  GW4064NA-Glycogen Insulin sensi- tivity  GlucoseGluconeogen- esis Insulin TAGFFACholesterol - HDL  RCT -TGR5LCA LOD BAT Glucose- NO-TLCA0.33CA440DCA320CDCA380T4  T3  Insulin Monocyte infiltration 6-EMCAINT-777 NA BAT WAT GLP-1 TAGNEFAAtheroscle-- rosis  Foam cell BAT brown adipose tissue WAT white adipose tissue T4 thyroxine T3 triiodothyronine GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide-1 TAG triacylglycerides FFA free fatty acids NEFAnon-esterified fatty acids RCT reverse cholesterol transport NO nitric oxide BP blood pressure LOD limit of detection NA not applicableSome of the most convincing clinical data to indicate a role of the gut microbiome in obesity has arisen from bariatric surgery studies.

Observational clinical studies have catalogued the gut microbiome alterations observed in these patients consistently reporting increased Pro- teobacteria and decreased Bacteroides levels .
