It is well known that nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D play an active role in bone health throughout the life span however the function andor synergies that many other nutrients have on bone are still emerging.Dietary fiber has been identified in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans as a shortfall nutrient that is under- consumed across the population and a public health concern because its absence from the diet has been shown to contribute to an increased level of health risk i.e.

In 2 adolescent studies  increases in bone calcium accrual amounted to about 40 gd which is equivalent to a projected 2 increase in net bone calcium annually.SCF may not only help increase calcium absorption in younger individuals but may help increase net calcium retention in those who have reached peak bone mass.

Though the in vitro approach is a use- ful tool to evaluate the potential impact of an ingredient in areas of the GI tract that are not easily accessible final valida- tion has to occur in in vivo trials as discussed in the next section.Role of prebiotic fibers in modifying calcium absorption and bone indices via changes in the microbiotaThe influence of prebiotics on increasing mineral absorption and enhancing bone properties through shifts in gut microbiota offers a strategy to improving calcium nutrition and bone health.

Prebiotic fiber consumption has been associated with shifts in gut microbial communities typically in fiber fermenters .

Adding small amounts of fibers 2.5-5.0 gserving to foods traditionally low in dietary fiber could help individuals meet their fiber require- ments without exceeding calorie needs  which is a real- istic and simple way to address global public health concerns.

Moreover these fibers may offer an additional means to enhance calcium absorption with the possibility of stimulating the gut microbiota to ulti- mately influence bone health.

Emerging research indicates that prebiotic fibers alter the gut microbiome which enhances fermentation of fibers causing production of SCFAs and offers additional means to enhance calcium absorption thus influencing bone health at all ages.
