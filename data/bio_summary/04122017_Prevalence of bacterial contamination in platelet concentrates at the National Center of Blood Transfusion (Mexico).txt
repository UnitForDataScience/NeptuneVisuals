the identification of contamination in the analyzed pc bags is not confirmed when the presence of contamination is reported the pc is discarded to the biological and infectious waste.

the pc bags were trans- ported at room temperature to the ncbt's research department for subsequent analysis.non-selective enrichment of microbial contaminants in the bactalert 3d automated systemall pc bags samplings were carried out under aseptic conditions prior sanitation with ethanol 70 in a laminar flow cabinet type 2. twenty milliliters of each pc bag were obtained by puncture with a hypodermic syringe subsequently 10 ml were directly inoculated into the bactalert 3dfa aerobic fan and 10 ml in fn anaerobic fan bot- tles biomerieux nueringen germany.

pc were obtained from october to december 2014 the inclusion criteria for selecting the pc bags were obtained before six hours after blood collection expiry date between one to five days post- blood fractionation storage under standard conditions in blood bank shaking at 100 rpm at 22 c negative infectious markers hiv hcv hbv chagas syphilis and brucella and no visual evidence of bacterial contamination.

however it is currently unclear whether the cleansing of the skin of a blood donor with a regime-based alcohol in a single step reduces the risk of blood contamination compared with a regimen alcohol-based two stages during blood donation in order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination by skin flora the use of two strategies has been reported the deviation of the first part of the rate of donation and the improvement of skin disinfection although the manipulation of pc bags for microbiological control is carried with strict adher- ence to good laboratory practices in terms of sterility such as the use of laminar flow cabinets broad spectrum sanitizers and the use of physical barriers such as gloves masks and lab coat the presence of false positive results may be present.

the prevalence of contamination reported in this study 9 has similarities with previous works in other countries such as ghana and nigeria which reported the prevalence of contaminated pc of 9 and 8.8 respectivelyby contrast the american red cross reported preva- lence of 0.017-0.019 it has been estimated that the level of contamination at the time of blood collection is relatively low about 20 cfuml or less the therapeutic use of sterile pcis of vital importance because patients requiring this type of transfusions are occasionally immunocompromised.

individual pc bags were stored under continuous agitation before microbiological control.sampling platelet concentratesusing simple random sampling techniques a sample size of 100 pc bags was analyzed.

the screening of pc to detect bacterial contamination is obligatory in mexico and it is carried out in quality control programs.

- nine of the 100 pc analyzed 9 showed bacterial contamination analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of characteristic microbiota from donor skin and soil.

the guidelines established by the official mexican standard nom-253-ssa1- 2012 for the shift life of pc recovered from whole blood pools of units and obtained by apheresis are five days after donation extendable up to 7 days if bacterial reduction systems or bacterial contamination detection methods are used.

the organism involved in bacterial contamination identified in this study suggests the possible contamination sources such as skin and soil therefore it is necessary to monitor disinfection procedures in phlebotomy services to motivate the staff to provide good practices in disinfection of the ante-cubital fosse with alcohol 70 followed by povidone-iodine and to train continuously and implement mandatory microbiologi- cal quality controls in the process of blood post fractionation.

- most common bacterial sepsis associated with transfusion is caused by contaminated platelet concentrates pc.
