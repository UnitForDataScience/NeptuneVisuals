The action of intestinal microbiota on primary bile acids results in the formation of secondary bile acid species deoxycholic and lithocholic acids derived from cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid respectively and thus microfloral composition is directly linked to secondary bile acid production and bile acid composition .A growing body of evidence has shown that significant inflammation and disturbed bile acid homeostasis are associated with T1DM  .

What is still to be eluci- dated is whether the changes in bile acids homeostasis are either a cause or a consequence of the metabolic distur- bances observed in the course of diabetes  .Potential therapeutic use of bile acids in diabetes can be achieved through two main applications as hypoglycaemic agents  and as absorption-enhancing agent in alterna- tive manner of insulin delivery .

The main advance in T1DM therapy would be the discovery of treatments that avoid and even replace the absolute requirement for injected insulin .Type 2 Diabetes MellitusT2DM formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance declining insulin production and eventual pancreatic b cell failure leading to a decrease in glucose transport into the liver muscle cells and fat cells.

Besides gliclazide reduces platelet reactivity that is also related to a reduction in oxidative stress as well .In diabetes therefore where increased glycation and oxidation are the basis of pathogenesis of diabetic vascular events drugs such as gliclazide with its antioxidant activ- ities may have an enhanced therapeutic role .Bile Acids as Hypoglycaemic AgentsRecent discoveries have demonstrated that bile acids secreted into the intestines not only act as digestive sur- factants that facilitate the absorption of lipophilic xenobi- otics but act also as signalling endocrine molecules regulating the glucose lipid and energy metabolism through complex and interrelated pathways -.The production of bile acids is localized primarily in hepatocytes where primary bile acids are synthesized directly from cholesterol.

TGR5 is activated by nanomolar con- centrations of LCA and micromolar concentrations of CA DCA and CDCA    .Thus therapeutic targeting of these receptors via specific and potent agonists including bile acids opens new perspectives for the treatment of numerous metabolic dis- orders including the diabetes mellitus.The Role of Gut Microflora and Probiotics in T1DMUnder normal physiological conditions the gut microflora represents a homeostatic ecosystem with several vital functions including food digestion metabolism of many endogenous substances such as bilirubin cholesterol bile acids steroid hormones fatty acids synthesis of vitamins B and K drug metabolism development of optimally functioning immune system and intestinal epithelial barrier and protection against potentially pathogenic bacteria pathogens  .

A possible explanation for hypoglycaemic effect of probiotics is the stimulation of intestinal microbiota to produce GLP-1 or other insulinotropic polypeptides or other factors that induce glucose uptake by the muscles or stimulate the liver to assimilate more blood glucose in the form of glycogen .Previous and Current study on Gliclazide-Bile Acids-Probiotics Interactions in the Treatment of T1DMOur team is intensively studying the relationship between antidiabetic drugs insulin gliclazide bile acids and pro- biotics regarding the potential application in metabolic disorders with special emphasis on diabetes mellitus.It has been confirmed that some patients whose T2DM progresses to T1DM have better control over glycaemia when continue to use gliclazide than those patients who use insulin alone.

In addition bile acids may behave as cancer promoters in gastrointestinal cells through an indirect mechanism involving oxidative stress and DNA damage .Intestinal bacteria can decrease the toxicity of the bile acid transforming a-OH bile acids to b-OH bile acids by reactions of oxidations and epimerizations that require the presence of specific hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases found in many Clostridia and a few other bacteria .

However more hydrophobic bile acids have lower critical micellar concentrations CMC and more cytotoxic properties  .6.1.1 Toxicity of Bile AcidsIn supraphysiological concentrations bile acids may cause the disruption of cell membranes through their detergent effect on lipid components and can promote the generation of reactive oxygen species that in turn oxidatively modify lipids proteins and nucleic acids and eventually cause hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis.

Potential role of this drug in T1DM is gaining a greater importance since it was found that it might have beneficial effect particularly in combination with bile acids and probiotics that will be discussed in detail in further text.Gliclazide belongs to the group of sulphonylureas that stimulate both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release via binding to b cell sulphonylurea receptor SUR1 encoded by the ABCC8 gene and possibly through a direct effect on intracellular calcium transport  .

By activating FXR bile acids have been shown to decrease hepatic glucose production increase glycogenesis improve insulin synthesis and secretion and improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity -.
