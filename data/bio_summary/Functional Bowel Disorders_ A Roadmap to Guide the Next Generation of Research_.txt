such studies have identified alterations in several brain networks relevant to ibs pathophysiology including the salience central executive default mode sensorimotor emotional arousal and central autonomic networks.to date such cross-sectional analyses have shown moderate correlations with clinical behavioral and other biologic parameters.gaps in the current knowledge of dysfunctional circuits in the human brain related to ibsare changes in the gut lumen environment intestinal barrier function and peripheral pathways prerequisites for changes in cns integration and perception alter- natively do changes in cns regions associated withmood and pain registration occur independently could both possibilities be truewhat changes are occurring in the neurochemical cod- ing in the brain circuits involved in ibs do changes in the microbiome alter the neurochemical codingdoes biological sex have a deterministic role in the neurochemical coding in these brain circuitswhat is the effect of early-life stress on the neuro- chemical coding in the brain circuits involved in ibsstrategies to address these gapsdevelop innovative strategies to address questions of causality which may lead to the identification of actionable biomarkers.define the neurochemical coding in the brain circuits implicated in ibs.conduct longitudinal imaging studies to facilitate the analysis of moderator and mediator variables.identify the role of gut microbial metabolites and im- mune parameters that may drive structural brain changes.design pharmacologic intervention studies eg inter- ventional phenotyping to identify brain parameters involved in symptom improvement.genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and environmental factorsan individual's risk of ibs increases if a family member is affected.

animal studies are poised to enhance the understanding of brain gut microbiome in- teractions in individuals with ibs.finally neuroimaging of the cns which is now possible in rodent models will allow direct comparison and translation to human brain imaging as well as reverse translation to relevant animal models.gaps in the current knowledge of the use of animal models to study the pathophysiology of fbdswhat are the areas of agreement and disagreement between animal and human studieswhat is the basis for the observed differences for example genetics epigenetics or bothcan mechanistically focused animal studies eg exam- ining the role of biologic sex in fbds and ibs be replicated in relevant human tissue samplescan animal models be used successfully for reverse translational researchstrategies to address the gapsperform comparative studies on male and female ani- mals to elucidate the mechanisms underlying biologic sex-related differences on clinically relevant outcome measures such as visceral pain including cns regions of interest intestinal barrier function and the microbiome.perform reverse translation from human brain imaging studies of central biomarkers to suitable animal models eg knockout or transgenic models for further mechanistic evaluations.use appropriate animal models to perform longitudinal time course studies to determine whether ibs is a top-down or bottom-up syndrome or both to essentially determine if the cns is driving the ibs phenotype or if changes in the gi tract are driving changes in the cns.

despite a rapid expansion in knowledge of fundamental neuronal brain gut interactions many aspects remain to be unrav- eled at the neuroanatomic and molecular levels.gaps in the current knowledge of the brain-gut pathways in ibswhat is the role of the vagus nerve in the pathophysi- ology of ibs vagal efferent cholinergic signaling sup- presses local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.clinical evidence supports impairment of vagus nerve function in ibs.what do the interactions among sensory afferents immune-competent cells glial cells and enterochro- maffin cells imply about the visceral hypersensitization processwhat is the cross-talk between intrinsic primary afferent neurons ipans and extrinsic primary affer- ents in the colon although intestinal primary afferent vagal fibers are believed to respond monosynaptically to luminal input novel evidence in the distal jejunum indicates that bacteria gut brain signaling is also mediated by ipans communicating to vagal afferents through a nicotinic synapse.what are the underlying brain gut neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in chronic stress in adulthood and in early-life adverse events that affect development of ibsstrategies to address the gapshistologically localize classes of colorectal afferent endings functionally determined mucosal muscular and serosal endings.identify the signatures of peripheral mediators involved in the sensitization of ipans and extrinsic afferents in different experimental models of ibs.define the epigenetic mechanisms underlying long-term sensitization of ipans and spinal afferents at the level of the dorsal root ganglia and the spinal cord.characterize the role of specific brain loci in bidirec- tional brain gut interactions such as barrington nucleus in locus coeruleus neurons which are highly responsive to stress and colorectal distention.evidence of irritable bowel syndrome related dysfunctional circuits in the human brainalthough multiple peripheral factors likely have impor- tant roles in shaping brain circuitry during development and in adulthood the brain is ultimately responsible for gener- ating the subjective experience of abdominal pain discom- fort and anxiety.

the intricate involvement of the brain in the bidirectional regulatory pathways of the brain gut axis make the cns an attractive source for noninvasive readouts of ibs-symptom related biologic markers or brain signatures.multimodal brain imaging allows standardized evalua- tion of numerous structural and functional brain parame- ters by using different scanners at multiple sites.

studies of twins show that genetic liability and heritability range from 1 to 20 and 0 to 57 respectively.genomic studies of ibs including studies of twins and familial aggregation have led to the discovery of putative candidate genes that are associated with the clin- ical disorder quantitative traits eg endophenotypes or the response to treatment through pharmacogenomic studies.

ensure studies are sufficiently powered to detect sex- based differences and those based on menstrual cycle phase and reproductive stage ie puberty through menopause.collect relevant biomarkers and clinical symptoms from multiple time points throughout life.characterize protective factors and risk factors associ- ated with fbds that develop early and later in life.characterize phenotypes of fbds and identify genes and gene combinations that contribute to those phenotypes.replicate and confirm genetic studies especially candidate gene association studies in larger samples.

the workshop covered a broad range of topics including prevalence of fbds and economic burden pathophysiology and patho- genesis of fbds the role of animal models neuromuscular dysfunction in fbds neurons smooth muscle glia inter- stitial cells of cajal and the microbiome brain gut path- ways in models of ibs and the role of primary afferent efferent and spinal components of the axis evidence of ibs-related dysfunctional circuits in the human brain genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and environmental factors the emerging role of dietary triggers in ibs current and emerging strategies to manage fbds and application of next-generation -omics technologies to diagnose and treat fbds with precision medicine.

the issue of sex differences within the models has received little attention to date but recent studies in rodents have shown sexually dimorphic effects of early-life stress on visceral sensitivity.thus future studies should include female animals.

enteric bacteria from the altered intestinalmicrobiomes associated with fbds are now believed to regulate aspects of the enteric neural circuitry and affect organ functions beyond the intestine.numerous studies have demonstrated that soluble me- diators found in mucosal biopsies and fecal supernatants from patients with ibs elicit physiologic responses in enteric neurons.in these studies ca2th- and voltage-sensitive dyes were used to show that supernatants extracted from ibs biopsy specimens excite enteric neurons.

use standardized pathologic criteria to define quantitative and qualitative changes in peripheral organs in various fbds.brain gut pathways in models of irritable bowel syndrome the role of primary afferent efferent and spinal components of the axisalthough the impact of the brain on gut function has long been known knowledge of the brain gut axis has increased substantially only in the past few decades.

candidate gene association studies in ibs have identified proteins involved in gi motor and sensory func- tion serotonin processing central and peripheral neural processing inflammation intestinal barrier function bile acid synthesis and processing and intestinal ion chan- nels.certain single nucleotide polymorphisms have also been associated with quantitative traits in ibs including gi transit times cardioautonomic tone acoustic startle response and morphologic brain imaging findings.-fbds such as ibs are stress-sensitive disorders similar to most chronic illnesses.

animal and human studies have demonstrated greater pain sensitivity in females than males.sex-based dif- ferences have been observed in the roles of hormones re- ceptors and signaling molecules and in the ascending and descending pathways of pain transduction in the spinal cord and brain.

apply a systems genetics approach to quantitate and integrate intermediate phenotypes including transcript protein and metabolite levels and gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions.conduct multicenter studies in rigorously phenotyped individuals with fbds for example implement similar inclusion and exclusion criteria validate symptom questionnaires standardize collection and testing of samples and identify quantitative traits such as in- termediate phenotypes or endophenotypes that may differentiate individuals with fbds from healthy con- trols and from patients with other gi conditions that have overlapping symptoms.perform longitudinal studies to determine the natural history of fbds identify protective factors and risk factors of fbd development and symptom severity and establish the predictive value of endophenotypes in symptom severity and treatment response.determine whether the rome iv diagnostic criteria for fbdswhich includes subgroups of ibs help increase response rates to therapeutic interventions.better understand how modifications of the gut micro- biome affect the gi tract and emotional components oftable 1. ibs current pharmacologic and dietary interventionsinterventionmain mechanism of actioneffect on the gutlow fodmap dietdecreased osmotic load and colonic distensiondecreased fermentation changes in the microbiome probioticschanges in the microbiomedecreased fermentation changes in sensationand permeabilityrifaximinnonsystemic minimally absorbed antibioticchanges in the microbiome altered permeability lubiprostoneluminally acting clc-2 chloride channel agonistincreased luminal secretion inhibition of nociceptors linaclotideluminally acting guanylate cyclase-2c agonistincreased luminal secretion inhibition of nociceptors alosetron5-ht3 antagonistdecreased visceral pain and secretions slowed transiteluxadolinemixed m- and k-opioid agonist and d-opioid receptor antagonistslowed colonic transit decreased colonic nociceptionantispasmodics including peppermint oilanticholinergics smooth muscle calcium-channel antagonistmuscle relaxation antispasmodictricyclic antidepressantsserotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitorsanticholinergic and antihistamine effectsdecrease visceral pain slowed colonic transitloperamide diphenoxylateopioid-receptor agonistdecreased colonic motility increased fluid absorptionfodmap fermentable oligo- di- monosaccharides and polyols ibs irritable bowel syndrome.the fbd symptom complex.
