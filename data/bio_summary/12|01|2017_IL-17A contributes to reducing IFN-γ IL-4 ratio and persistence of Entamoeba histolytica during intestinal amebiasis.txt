in our study il-4 expression was lower in the il-17a ko mice than in the wt mice which may also be associated with the lower parasite burden and disease severity in the il-17a ko mice in week 4. however the factors that regulate the ifn-gil-4 ratio are unclear and the direct or indirect relationship between il-4 and il-17a remains to be clarified.in the absence of il-17a the number of cd4 t cells was reduced at 4 weeks after infection.

although il- 17a augmentation before infection by either vaccination or the mod- ulation of the intestinal microbiome made the host resistant to in- testinal amebiasis the roles of the il-17a endogenously induced during the natural course of e. histolytica infection remain to be clarified.in this study we have investigated the role of il-17a during e.histolytica infection using il-17a knockout ko and wild-type wt mice in a cbaj background as c57bl6 mice are resistant to amebae infection .

these results indicate that in the absence of il-17a the ifn-gil-4 ratio increased.alteration in the infiltrating cells in the il-17a ko micebecause il-17a is a chemoattractant for neutrophils the numbers of neutrophils monocytes and dendritic cells were determined in the lamina propria of each mouse.

therefore il-17a contributes to the persistence of e. histolytica and modulates the immune response including the ifn-gil-4 ratio which may be responsible for the reduction of the parasite burden in the il-17a knockout mice during the chronic phase of intestinal amebiasis.introductionamebiasis is an infectious disease caused by entamoeba histolytica an anaerobic protozoan parasite and is a major public health problem worldwide particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene .

an increase in il-17a was also observed when mice were vaccinated with a recombinant leca fragment of the e. histolytica surface galgalnac lectin  and the blockade of il-17a from 1 day before to 4 days after challenge abro- gated the protective effect induced by the vaccine .

the number of e. histolytica was measured byquantitative real-time pcr b. for parasite quantification the indicated number of mice was used in each group week 1 n  13 and week 4 n  10. p  0.05.resultsentamoeba histolytica numbers reduced in il-17a ko mice in week 4 but not in week 1 post-infectionto clarify the role of il-17a during intestinal amebiasis wt and il- 17a ko cbaj mice were challenged intracecally with 2 x 106 tro- phozoites and sacrificed at week 1 or 4 post-infection.

both the wt and ko mice showed a high infection rate and no significant difference was observed in either the infection rate or the parasite numbers in week 1. however in week 4 both the infection rate and the number of parasites were significantly reduced in the ko mice but not in the wt mice a b. the ceca of the wt and ko mice were inflamed in week 1 and no significant difference was apparent in the inflammation scores of the wt and ko mice c-d. however in week 4 the wt ceca were highly inflamed whereas the inflammation score was significantly lower in the il-17a ko mice e f and g.ifn-g expression was significantly higher in ko mice than in wt but induction of il-4 expression was much lower in ko mice in week 4 after infection with e. histolyticato investigate why the il-17a ko mice displayed fewer e. histolytica than the wt in week 4 we evaluated the expression levels of cytokine mrnas.

in week 1 the induction of il-12p19 was significantly lower in the il-17a ko mice 5.6-fold than in the wt 18.1-fold f. it was also lower in the ko mice 9.0-fold than in the wt 32.3-fold in week 4 but the difference was not statistically significant.in week 4 two il-17a ko mice were uninfected or recovered fromthe infection.

considering the protective roles of neutrophils in the early stage of e. histolytica infection and the impact of il-17a on the accumulation of neutrophils we expected that a lack of il-17a would increase the number of e. histolytica in the gut by reducing the accumulation of neutrophils.

moreover during toxoplasma gondii infection the absence of il-17ra a receptor for both il-17a and il-17f which binds to il-17a with higher affinity enhanced the ifn-g response causing exaggerated in- flammation in the infected organs and increased mortality .

however the role of interleukin-17a il-17a which is upregulated during the natural course of intestinal amebiasis has not been clarified.

the aim of this study was to investigate the role of il-17a during intestinal amebiasis in a mouse model.

il-17a knockout and wild-type cbaj mice were challenged intracecally with 2 x 106 e. histolytica trophozoites and their infection pathology and immune responses were monitored.
