2004 Jeffcoat Geurs Reddy Gold- enberg  Hauth 2001 Offenbacher 2004 are associated with PTB 2 several PTB studies have identified pathogenic microbes from the chorioamnion and amniotic fluid of women with PTB DiGiulio 2012 Marconi de Andrade Ramos Per- acoli Donders  da Silva 2011 3 subclinical intrauterine infection is associated with PTB Gomez et al.

Identification of novel biobehavioral pathways to PTB may ultimately lead to the development of interventions to reduce the risk of PTB particularly among groups with the greatest risk.Although many mammalian species exhibit slight variations in gestational length PTB appears to be primarily a human phenomenon Phillips Abbot  Rokas 2015.

Trials to treat various infections have shown limited efficacy in reducing PTB risk suggesting that other complex mechanisms including those associated with inflammation may be involved in the relationship between microbes infection and PTB.

Although PTB rates have declined in the general U.S. popula- tion since 2007 the overall rate remains around 12 which exceeds the March of Dimes Prematurity Campaign 2020 PTB rate goal of 8.1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014 March of Dimes 2016 J.

African American AA women one of the groups at highest risk are 1.5 times as likely to experience PTB and nearly 2 times as likely to have an early PTB 32 weeks' gestation compared to Caucasian women Culhane  Goldenberg 2011 Kramer Hogue Dunlop  Menon 2011 March of Dimes 2014.

Authors have reported that identified risk factors associated with PTB such as mater- nal age history of infection and substance use explain less thanhalf of the disparity in rate of PTB between AA and Caucasian women Goldenberg Culhane  Iams 2008 McGrady Sung Rowley  Hogue 1992.

Of the many biological processes implicated in the onset of PTB intrauterine infection andor inflammation are strongly associated with an increased risk for PTB Goldenberg Hauth  Andrews 2000 Goncalves Chai- worapongsa  Romero 2002 Romero et al.

Despite this relationship between infection and PTB randomized controlled trials directly targeting known contributors of intrauterine infection--including the elimina- tion of bacterial vaginosis BV sexually transmitted infec- tions and periodontal disease during pregnancy--have shown limited efficacy in reducing the risk of PTB Lynch Wagner Deterding et al.
