However information concerning the influence of corn silage based diets on the microbial ecology in the rumen of dairy cows is limited.Information on rumen microbial dynamics in dairy cows is emerging - Recent reports include changes in the composition of ruminal microbiota in dairy cows in association with parity - diet breed feed efficiency milk yield and composition  and physiological status .

The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the rumen of dairy cows is a common finding reported by several authors - However the proportion of Bacteroidetes ob- served in this study was much higher compared to the above reports but similar to our previous findings Differences among reports can be attributed to differences in dietary composition sampling timesand methodologies employed in rumen bacterial di- versity analysis Previous reports  indicate Proteobacteria ac- counts for a very small proportion 1-5 of the rumen bacterial population.

Alfalfa silage when fed to steersshowed an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria as compared to Sainfoin silage  Fur- ther in experiments that involved feeding a combination of corn silage 33 DM and alfalfa silage 25 DM rumen Succinovibrionaceae was detected at 4 in the li- quid and 6 in the solid fraction When corn silage comprised 60 DM and alfalfa silage 9 DM rumen Succinivibrionaceae was reported at 4 in dairy cows Similar to these findings the combination of corn silage and alfalfa silage fed on Farm 12 may have con- tributed to the higher abundance of rumen Succinivi- brionaceae at 4-8.

We analyzed the composition of rumen bacterial communities using Ion Torrent PGM se- quencing and investigated their relationship with nu- trition and production parameters.MethodsExperimental detailsThis study included 85 animals of Holstein breed selected from two dairy herds in southeastern Pennsylvania a higher producing farm Farm 12 M305  12300 kg n  47 including 24 primiparous 23 multiparouscows 11 s 4 third 6 fourth and 2 fifth lactation cows and a lower producing farm Farm 9 M305  9700 kg n  38 including 19 primiparous 19 multip- arous cows 11 s 6 third and 2 fourth lactation cows.

BMC Microbiology 2017 17190DOI 10.1186s12866-017-1098-zComparison of rumen bacterial communities in dairy herds of different productionNagaraju Indugu1 Bonnie Vecchiarelli1 Linda D. Baker1 James D. Ferguson1 Jairam K. P. Vanamala23 and Dipti W. Pitta1BackgroundNearly 70 of energy and 60-85 of protein re- quirements of the dairy cow are met from microbial fermentation indicating a critical need for maximizing rumen function and describing rumen microbiota.

FC ferment slowly and are important in regulating rumen function through formation of the rumen mat and influencing the rate of passage out of the rumen.

In addition to higher concentrations of starch processing of grain hasa major impact on the rumen availability of starch and thus can influence the populations of Succinivibriona- ceae in the rumen as revealed by the findings of Shipp et al Effects of corn processing method and dietary in- clusion of wet distillers grains with soluble on rumen microbial dynamics in finishing steers Ginger submit- ted where the authors observed that Succinivibriona- ceae was doubled when finishing beef cattle were fed steam flaked corn compared to dry rolled corn.

The pro- portions of Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in dairy cows from Farm 9 were similar to our earlier re- ports from the same herd This consistency in findings on Farm 9 suggests that the rumen bacterial profiles remain fairly stable for a dairy herd under simi- lar management and dietary regimen.Linking diets and rumen bacterial communities The feed ingredients used in the TMR for Farm 9 and Farm 12 were different.

We speculate an increase in rumen Succinivibrionaceae may be associated with greater starch availability in the rumen of high yielding dairy cows in Farm 12.
