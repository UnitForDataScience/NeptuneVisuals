in addition the mean proportion of ground corn 19.4 in farm 12 tmr was about 4.3 units greater than that of farm 9 15.1 suggesting increased rumen starch avail- ability on farm 12. we speculate an increase in rumen succinivibrionaceae may be associated with greater starch availability in the rumen of high yielding dairy cows in farm 12. high-grain diets appear to favor the growth of these bacterial populations which agrees with the findings of this study where corn grain was fed in higher amounts on farm 12. in addition to higher concentrations of starch processing of grain hasa major impact on the rumen availability of starch and thus can influence the populations of succinivibriona- ceae in the rumen as revealed by the findings of shipp et al effects of corn processing method and dietary in- clusion of wet distillers grains with soluble on rumen microbial dynamics in finishing steers ginger submit- ted where the authors observed that succinivibriona- ceae was doubled when finishing beef cattle were fed steam flaked corn compared to dry rolled corn.

however information concerning the influence of corn silage based diets on the microbial ecology in the rumen of dairy cows is limited.information on rumen microbial dynamics in dairy cows is emerging - recent reports include changes in the composition of ruminal microbiota in dairy cows in association with parity - diet breed feed efficiency milk yield and composition  and physiological status .

milk fat  was higher for the primiparous cows on farm 9 3.73 as compared to the primiparous cows on farm 12 3.32. overall for both farms and parity groups milk fat  and protein  was higher in low yielding cows compared to high yielding cows for both farms and parity groups.sequencing informationapproximately 660913 reads were analyzed from 85 rumen bacterial communities with an average of 7775 reads per sample and greater than 3353 reads per sample additional file table s1.

the abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the rumen of dairy cows is a common finding reported by several authors - however the proportion of bacteroidetes ob- served in this study was much higher compared to the above reports but similar to our previous findings differences among reports can be attributed to differences in dietary composition sampling timesand methodologies employed in rumen bacterial di- versity analysis previous reports  indicate proteobacteria ac- counts for a very small proportion 1-5 of the rumen bacterial population.

alfalfa silage when fed to steersshowed an increased abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria as compared to sainfoin silage  fur- ther in experiments that involved feeding a combination of corn silage 33 dm and alfalfa silage 25 dm rumen succinovibrionaceae was detected at 4 in the li- quid and 6 in the solid fraction when corn silage comprised 60 dm and alfalfa silage 9 dm rumen succinivibrionaceae was reported at 4 in dairy cows similar to these findings the combination of corn silage and alfalfa silage fed on farm 12 may have con- tributed to the higher abundance of rumen succinivi- brionaceae at 4-8. succinivibrionaceae otus were also more diverse and positively correlated with milk yield in farm 12 compared to farm 9 where succinivi- brionaceae otus associated with milk production were not detected.

again supporting the increase in rumen succinivibrionaceae may be associated with greater starch availability in the rumen of high yielding dairy cows in farm 12. the high- est dietary starch concentration in this study 32.1 was in the multiparous cows on farm 12 which was also the group with the highest level of milk production.

we analyzed the composition of rumen bacterial communities using ion torrent pgm se- quencing and investigated their relationship with nu- trition and production parameters.methodsexperimental detailsthis study included 85 animals of holstein breed selected from two dairy herds in southeastern pennsylvania a higher producing farm farm 12 m305  12300 kg n  47 including 24 primiparous 23 multiparouscows 11 s 4 third 6 fourth and 2 fifth lactation cows and a lower producing farm farm 9 m305  9700 kg n  38 including 19 primiparous 19 multip- arous cows 11 s 6 third and 2 fourth lactation cows.

a difference in milk yield of 9.5 and 18.1 kgd was noted between the high and low producing cows for primiparous and multiparous groups respectively for farm 12. a difference of 11.7 and 9.7 kgd was noted between high and low produ- cing cows in the primiparous and multiparous groups respectively for farm 9. milk fat  was the lowest 3.20 in the high producing multiparous cows and was the highest 3.86 in the low producing multip- arous cows from both farm 9 and farm 12 most likely associated with the higher milk yields and dilu- tion of milk components.

fc ferment slowly and are important in regulating rumen function through formation of the rumen mat and influencing the rate of passage out of the rumen.

the pro- portions of bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria in dairy cows from farm 9 were similar to our earlier re- ports from the same herd this consistency in findings on farm 9 suggests that the rumen bacterial profiles remain fairly stable for a dairy herd under simi- lar management and dietary regimen.linking diets and rumen bacterial communities the feed ingredients used in the tmr for farm 9 and farm 12 were different.
