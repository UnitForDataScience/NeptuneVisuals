For the other tested strains the bacterial growth in the medium containing S. rebaudiana FOS was significant p  0.05 lower than the medium containing prebiotic control.The inulin molecules isolated from S. rebaudiana stems was evaluated to be not a suitable energy source neither for bifidobac- teria nor for lactobacilli because no statistically significant increase p  0.05 in optical density of the medium containing this sugar source compared to the basal medium without sugar was detected .The prebiotic control Oraftir P95 was the most suitable for comparison with FOS extracts of S. rebaudiana stems because both are polysaccharides with similar chemical structure and degree of polymerization that provide more similar fermentation parame- ters unlike the Wilkins Chalgren broth WCB where glucose mole- cules are used as carbon source this medium it is easily fermented and it is not a selective medium.

The average increases in the growth of the bifidobacteria and lac- tobacilli strains were 2.28-fold and 1.7-fold respectively.Among the tested bifidobacteria the strain B. bifidum CCDM 559 showed better capacity to fermente FOS from S. rebaudiana and in this case was detected even better growth in the medium contain- ing S. rebaudiana FOS than in the medium with Oraftir P95 a com- mercial prebiotic product containing FOS from chicory.From lactobacilli group the strain L. gasseri PHM-7E1 was eval- uated to utilize FOS from S. rebaudiana stems most efficiently where the highest increase in optical density after 24 h incubationFig.

The objective of the present study was to isolate and character- ize fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides from S. rebaudiana stems as well as evaluate the prebiotic activity of these molecules in vitro with the propose of obtaining products of commercialinterest from waste generated by the sweetener industry.Materials and methodsMaterialsThe S. rebaudiana stems were obtained from field cultivar of the Iguatemi Research Station located at 230200SL 520040WL and alti- tude of 506 m of the State University of Maringa.

GC-MS Chromatogram TIC of oxime-silylated derivatives A inulin and from S. rebaudiana stems B fructo-oligosaccharides from S. rebaudiana stems C fructose standard D glucose standard.The correlation map HMBC  showed the occurrence of a cross-peak between H-1 and C-2 and the concomitant absence of correlations between C-2 and H-6 suggests a b-21 linkage between fructosyl residues.

The DP calculated for inulin obtained from S. rebaudiana stems by GC-MS was 12.In the NMR analysis of inulin molecules the H10 signal of termi- nal glucose was observed at low intensity in the anomeric region of the 1H NMR spectrum A at d 5.45 1H d J  3.8 Hz.

Both fractions were lyophilized to obtain the dry inulin and FOS extracts.Total sugar determinationThe total carbohydrate content in the extracts was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method with d-fructose as the standard .Monosaccharide compositionThe samples of inulin and FOS 5.0 mg from S. rebaudiana stems were hydrolyzed with 0.5 M trifluoroacetic acid TFA at 60 degC for 1 h followed by oxime derivatization with methoxya- mine hydrochloric acid in pyridine 20 mgmL at 70 degC for 1 h.Then the oximes were trimethylsilylated with 200 lL of the fol-lowing derivatization mixture HMDS  TMCS  Pyridine 319 .The silylated oxime derivatives dissolved in 200 lL hexanewere analyzed by Gas Chromatography Agilent 7890B coupled with Mass Spectrometry Agilent 5977A MSD using an HP5-MS UI-Agilent with a fused silica capillary column 30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 lm.

The chemical characteri- zation of the samples by GC-MS NMR and off-line ESI-MS showed that it was possible to obtain inulin molecules from the S. rebaudiana stems with a degree of polymerization DP of 12 and FOS with a DP  6.

The use of blends of short- and long- chain fructans which are selectively metabolized in the proximal and distal colon respectively enhances the fermentative and pre- biotic effects of these molecules  .The obtaining of two products inulin and FOS with different industrial applications from the same source S. rebaudiana stems is a low cost option for commercial extraction from industrial waste.Inulin characterizationIn the monosaccharide composition analysis by GC-MS the peaks were identified according to retention time in comparison with fructose C and glucose D standards the frag- mentation profile of the mass spectra of oxime-silylated deriva- tives Fig.
