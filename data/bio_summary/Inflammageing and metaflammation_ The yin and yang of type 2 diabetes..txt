however the accumulated data definitely suggest that the active life- style is one of the best approaches to management of low-grade in- flammation preventing t2dm development and cvds and promoting healthy ageing .anti-metaflammation activity of anti-hyperglycaemic medications showing a high clinical value in terms of prevention of t2dm complicationsmetforminmeta-analysis of long-marketed hypoglycaemic drugs and clinical trials of new anti-diabetic medications have revealed different out- comes between various compounds in relation to prevention of t2dm complications .

furthermore aside from over-nu-trition ageing increases the activity of the ikk-b-nf-kb axis in thehypothalamus indicating cerebral low-grade inflammation as a common denominator of both conditions .non-obese patients with t2dm present systemic low-grade inflammation resembling 'inflammageing'adipose tissue is often regarded as the main and earliest source of low-grade inflammation in obesity-induced t2dm with noticeable in- filtration of both innate-immunity cells and lymphocytes into this tissue as extensively reviewed elsewhere  .

thus the sasp has been proposed as a relevant contributor to the low-grade inflammation observed in pa- tients with t2dm .ageing and an hfd induce the sasp in diabetes-relevant tissuesthe more relevant evidence for sasp being related to metabolic imbalances has been obtained in mouse models of ageing- or hfd-in- duced t2dm or insulin resistance  .

selective removal of harmful cells may eventually revolutionise the management of patients with diabetes by possibly allowing for interventions in the patients in whom age and obesity are the main determinants of t2dm even in long-lasting dis- ease considering the chronic nature of both senescent-cell accumula-tion and t2dm .

accumulating evidence shows a preventive effect of this diet on t2dm development beneficial influence on the management of glycated haemoglobin and prevention of cv events in patients with t2dm .

nevertheless contextualised extrapolations about future diet-based interventions deserve further research and hold a tre- mendous potential for amelioration of metaflammation thereby re- presenting a promising approach to combating t2dm progression and the development of its complications.physical activity ameliorates metaflammationinadequate physical activity is linked to a wide range of chronic diseases including obesity t2dm and other ards  .

moreover empagliflozin can com- pletely suppress post-prandial glucose-induced inflammation in mice .in addition to clinical considerations regarding selection of medi- cations for some sub-groups of patients with t2dm molecular data accompanying clinical-trial-tested molecules are suggestive of nu- merous interesting effects linked or not linked to glycaemia thus of- fering new potentially druggable targets against metaflammation and for the prevention of t2dm complications.

we discuss the possibility of harnessing these recent discoveries in future therapies for t2dm.

finally we examine the latest findings showing putative anti-inflammatory mechanisms of anti-hyperglycaemic agents with proven efficacy against t2dm-induced cardiovascular complications in order to gain insights into quickly translatable therapeutic approaches.introductiontype 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm is a chronic multifactorial disease characterised by metabolic hormonal epigenetic and oxidative im- balances  .

the main pathological features of t2dm are chronic hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia which induce a plethora of molecular alterations eventually leading to the development of com- plications i.e.

a critical component of t2dm is chronic low-grade inflamma- tion recently referred to as 'metaflammation' i.e.

this chronic condition involves the same cellular and molecular players of acute inflammatory responsesand accumulating evidence is being provided regarding metaflamma- tion's role in the development of both t2dm itself and diabetes-induced cardiovascular cv complications .seminal discoveries initially pointed out a role for low-grade in- flammation as a major determinant of obesity-induced insulin re- sistance.

supporting the idea that inflammation is the link between obesity and diabetes development  .inflammation can promote t2dm development by inducing insulin resistance and dysfunction of b-cells and the hypothalamusthe role of inflammation in induction of an alteration of metabolism is increasingly being accepted a number of papers have provided considerable evidence .

the observation that chronic infectious diseases can lead to the development of t2dm fur- ther reinforces this notion .
