bmc bioinformatics 2017 18434doi 10.1186s12859-017-1849-8metacomp comprehensive analysis software for comparative meta-omics including comparative metagenomicspeng zhai1 longshu yang12 xiao guo2 zhe wang12 jiangtao guo12 xiaoqi wang12 and huaiqiu zhu123abstractbackground during the past decade the development of high throughput nucleic sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis techniques have enabled the characterization of microbial communities through metagenomics metatranscriptomics metaproteomics and metabolomics data.

meanwhile biologists are increasingly concerning about the correlations between meta-omics features and environmental factors which may further decipher the adaptation strategy of a microbial community.results we developed a graphical comprehensive analysis software named metacomp comprising a series of statistical analysis approaches with visualized results for metagenomics and other meta-omics data comparison.

meanwhile by applying these techniques many studies have reported that the composition of microbial community varies with depth of ocean and oscillates seasonally in western english channel  gene expression pattern of a microbiota fluctuates during different growth stages in acid mine drainage amd  furthermore it is notable that an increasing number of studies pay attention on measuring physiological or ecological vari- ables for comprehensively investigating the responds of microbial communities to environmental factor varia- tions this trend requires bioinformat- ics tools not only to distinguish environmental effects on microbiotas through p-value from hypothesis test- ing or correlation analysis but also to unveil intrinsic mechanisms by statistical modeling such as regression analysis.for comparative metagenomics the first tool named as xipe-totec offered two-sample test and utilizedmetagenomic shotgun sequences as input  then megan was designed to perform barplot for compar- ing multiple samples clustered in taxonomic or functional clustering views and integrate all types of meta-omics data except metabolomics data in the latest version imgm is a web portal supporting a systematical service containing taxonomic classification sequence assembly functional annotation and differential abundance analysis for two- and multi-sample comparison of metagenomic reads another comparative metagenomics analy- sis tool stamp mainly exploits fishers's exact test in two-sample test and t-test in two-group samples.

metacomp provides a concise graphical user interface that two drop-down menus are presented file for data input and analysis for analysis method selection.

finally integrated statistical analysis options and visualization for these analysis are demonstrated.

herein we introduce each statistical analysis option in the following paragraphs.multivariate statisticsmetacomp employs principal component analysis pca and clustering approaches e.g.

the total number of features i fi observed in metagenomic sample j sj is represented by cij see table .statistical analysis options and visualizationwe integrated a series of statistical analysis options in metacomp see fig.

this automatical selection will be helpful for users lacking of adequate statistical training.moreover odds ratio or test was also implemented to evaluate the relative abundance for each feature as table demonstrated.regression analysis of environmental factorsmetacomp provides a novel function regression anal- ysis of environmental factors which means regression analysis of the influence exerted by environmental fac- tors on microbial communities.

the option is made through analysis menu and parameters is set in pop-up dialog boxes.the result of analysis is displayed as excelspreadsheet with corresponding visualization.application in comparison of meta-omic samplesthere are four types of meta-omics data characteriz- ing microbiota in different levels but revealing two types of information--static composition of taxon as well as functional gene and dynamic gene expression condition of a microbial community.

to reveal the diversity of microbial communities and interactions between living conditions and microbes it is necessary to introduce comparative analysis based upon integration of all four types of data mentioned above.

after data loading analyses such as multivariate statistics hypothesis testing of two-sample multi-sample as well as two-group sample and a novel function--regression analysis of environmental factors are offered.

here regression analysis regards meta-omic features as independent variable and environmental factors as dependent variables.

we further evaluate the performance of its choice and exhibit applications for metagenomics metaproteomics and metabolomics samples.conclusion metacomp an integrative software capable for applying to all meta-omics data originally distills the influence of living environment on microbial community by regression analysis.
