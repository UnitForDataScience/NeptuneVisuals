In this study dietary capsaicin failed to improve obesity probably due to the short capsaicin feeding time andor the low capsaicin dose.

However our results should be interpreted cautiously due to the lower caloric intake at the initial stage after capsaicin diet administration.Keywords capsaicin obesity diabetes glucose homeostasis gut microbiotaINTRODUCTIONThe use of chili peppers as an integral part of the diet has a long history and is highly popular worldwide.

A P-value  0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSEffects of Dietary Capsaicin on Obesity ParametersTo investigate whether dietary capsaicin can prevent obesity obob mice were fed with a standard chow diet plus different doses of capsaicin for 6 weeks.

Similarly dietary capsaicin at either the low or high dose also failed to inhibit the development of obesity as evidenced by a similar adiposity index and Lee's obesity index when compared with the normal diet at 6 weeks P  0.05 Figures 1DE.In addition although both the low- and high-capsaicin diets led to the marked decreases in food intake and caloric intakes during the first 2 weeks compared with the normal diet P 0.05 the food and caloric intakes were not significantly different among the three groups from 3 to 6 weeks P  0.05 Figures 1BC.Effects of Dietary Capsaicin on Blood Glucose and Insulin LevelsTo investigate the effect of dietary capsaicin on glucose homeostasis fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were first determined in obob mice.

Both the low- capsaicin diet and the high-capsaicin diet significantly inhibited the increase of fasting blood glucose and insulin levels at 6 weeks of feeding and the inhibitory effects were comparable between the low-capsaicin and high-capsaicin diet groups P  0.05 Figures 2AB.Effects of Dietary Capsaicin on Glucose Tolerance and Insulin ToleranceTo further assess the role of dietary capsaicin in regulating glucose homeostasis the OGTT and ITT were performed in obob mice at 6 weeks.

In addition the AUC data for the OGTT indicated that dietary capsaicin resulted in a significantly reduced AUC in obob mice fed with a capsaicin diet at either a low or a high dose than in those with a normal diet P  0.05indicating a markedly improved glucose tolerance in capsaicin- treated diabetic mice Figure 2D.

Similar results reflecting the beneficial effect of dietary capsaicin on glucose homeostasis were also found with the ITT Figures 2EF.Effect of Dietary Capsaicin on the Gut Microbiota StructureTo investigate whether dietary capsaicin can lead to specific alterations in the gut microbiota structure in obob mice the fecal samples at 6 weeks after feeding were analyzed.

These results indicated that the overall gut microbiota structure of obob mice remained stable during dietary capsaicin intervention.Effect of Dietary Capsaicin on the Gut Microbiota CompositionTo further determine the relationship between dietary capsaicin and the gut microbiota composition in the regulation of glucose homeostasis taxonomy-based analysis was performed at the phylum and genus levels.

In addition similar findings were found in the correlations between the AUC of the OGTT and the abundances of Roseburia r -0.7143 P  0.0028 Bacteroides r  0.6964 P  0.0039 andParabacteroides r  0.6214 P  0.0134 Figures 6D-F.Effects of Dietary Capsaicin onShort-Chain Fatty Acids Gastrointestinal Hormones and Pro-inflammatory CytokinesTo observe the potential mechanisms underlying the improved glucose homeostasis by dietary capsaicin the levels of fecal short- chain fatty acids plasma gastrointestinal hormones and plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in obob mice after 6 weeks of capsaicin feeding.

A number of animal studies have indicated that the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on obesity relies on a sufficient dose exceeding 10 mgkg body weight or 0.01 capsaicin in the diet and a lasting administration period of 5-6 weeks Zhang et al.
