similarly dietary capsaicin at either the low or high dose also failed to inhibit the development of obesity as evidenced by a similar adiposity index and lee's obesity index when compared with the normal diet at 6 weeks p  0.05 figures 1de.in addition although both the low- and high-capsaicin diets led to the marked decreases in food intake and caloric intakes during the first 2 weeks compared with the normal diet p 0.05 the food and caloric intakes were not significantly different among the three groups from 3 to 6 weeks p  0.05 figures 1bc.effects of dietary capsaicin on blood glucose and insulin levelsto investigate the effect of dietary capsaicin on glucose homeostasis fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were first determined in obob mice.

both the low- capsaicin diet and the high-capsaicin diet significantly inhibited the increase of fasting blood glucose and insulin levels at 6 weeks of feeding and the inhibitory effects were comparable between the low-capsaicin and high-capsaicin diet groups p  0.05 figures 2ab.effects of dietary capsaicin on glucose tolerance and insulin toleranceto further assess the role of dietary capsaicin in regulating glucose homeostasis the ogtt and itt were performed in obob mice at 6 weeks.

at the genus level both low- and high-capsaicin-treated obob mice showed enriching effects on roseburia abundance and inhibiting effects on bacteroides and parabacteroides abundances figures 5c-e. in addition the effects of dietary capsaicin on the gut microbiota composition at the phylum and genus levels showed no significant differences between the low-capsaicin and high-capsaicin diet groups figures 5b-e.correlations between the glucose parameters and the gut microbiota abundanceto assess whether dietary capsaicin-induced glucose homeostasis improvement is associated with alterations of the gut microbiota in obob mice spearman correlation analysis was performed todetermine the correlations between the glucose parameters and the bacterial abundance at the genus level.

the analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between the fasting blood glucose level and the abundance of roseburia r  -0.9000 p  0.0001 and positive correlations between the fasting blood glucose level and the abundances of bacteroides r  0.8607 p  0.0001 and parabacteroides r  0.6250 p  0.0127 figures 6a-c. in addition similar findings were found in the correlations between the auc of the ogtt and the abundances of roseburia r -0.7143 p  0.0028 bacteroides r  0.6964 p  0.0039 andparabacteroides r  0.6214 p  0.0134 figures 6d-f.effects of dietary capsaicin onshort-chain fatty acids gastrointestinal hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokinesto observe the potential mechanisms underlying the improved glucose homeostasis by dietary capsaicin the levels of fecal short- chain fatty acids plasma gastrointestinal hormones and plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in obob mice after 6 weeks of capsaicin feeding.

spearman's correlation analysis revealed that the roseburia abundance was negatively while the bacteroides and parabacteroides abundances were positively correlated to the fasting blood glucose level and area under the curve by the oral glucose tolerance test.

2014 are effective strategies to inhibit the development of obesity-related disorders.although the existing findings emphasize the indispensable role of the gut microbiota in obesity and glucose metabolic disorders whether the effects of dietary capsaicin on obesity and glucose homeostasis is mediated by the gut microbiota have not been fully identified.

the adiposity index was calculated by the formula 100 x mesenteric fat weight  epididymal fat weight  perirenal fat weight  body weight and lee's obesity index was calculated by the formula body weight g0.33 x 104  naso-anal length mm.biochemical analysesthe fasting blood glucose levels were measured using an accu-chek active blood glucose meter roche diagnostics mannheim germany by puncturing the tail vein.

in addition blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus for determination of plasma insulin using a commercially available ria kit beijing furui biotechnology co. ltd. china according to the manufacturer's instructions.oral glucose tolerance test ogtt and insulin tolerance test ittfor the ogtt the mice were administered with an oral glucose load of 2 gkg body weight after 16 h of fasting.

the blood glucose levels were assessed using samples obtained from the tail vein at 0 15 30 60 90 and 120 min following the glucose load.

blood glucose concentrations were measured with a glucose analyzer as described above.

the ogtt showed that the blood glucose levels were significantly lower in obob mice fed with a capsaicin diet than in those with a normal diet at all-time points after glucose load p  0.05 figure 2c.

in addition the plasma total glp-1 level was higher and the plasma total ghrelintnf-a il-1b and il-6 levels were lower in obob mice fed with the low- or high- capsaicin diet than those with the normal diet p  0.05 figures 7b-f.discussionusing a classic animal model simulating human obesity-related type 2 diabetes this study provided novel evidence that dietarycapsaicin significantly prevented the increases of fasting glucose and insulin as well as markedly alleviated impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in obese diabetic obob mice.

2016. in addition the capsaicin dose that can improve glucose homeostasis was lower than that that can inhibit obesity and the improvement of glucose homeostasis occurs prior to the inhibition of obesity okumura et al.

2012 were carried out in spontaneous obese diabetic models with genetic mutations obob mice or kkay mice which demonstrated that dietary capsaicin only improved glucose homeostasis without affecting the obesity-related phenotypes.clearly the pathogenesis and features of genetic diabetic modelsare substantially different from those of dietary models.numerous studies have demonstrated that many dietary components are able to inhibit obesity andor improve glucose homeostasis by regulating the gut microbiota.

the beneficial effect of dietary capsaicin on glucose homeostasis is likely related to the increased abundance of roseburia and the decreased abundances of bacteroides and parabacteroides at the genus level and which contribute to the improvement of glucose homeostasis by increasing short-chain fatty acids regulating gastrointestinal hormones and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines.
