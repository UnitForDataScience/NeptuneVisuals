We aimed to assess levels of serum PKM2 in healthy and newly diagnosed IBD patients and its relationship with IBD indices and microbiota changes.Design and methods IBD serum samples from newly diagnosed patients were collected and analyzed using a PKM2-ELISA and correlated with disease activity scores IBD disease type and intestinal microbiota.

These studies identified PKM2 as candidate marker for inclusion into a biomarker panel for IBD diagnosis and additionally showed PKM2 was predictive of a dysbiotic gut microbiome in CD.At present current biomarkers of IBD complement the assessment ofthe IBD patient but are inadequate to reliably and reproducibly de- termine disease diagnosis stage progression and response to treat- ment.

Low variability in PKM2 among IBD patients warrants further evaluation as it is an attractive feature not possessed by other IBD biomarkers and may improve accuracy and sensitivity of IBD diagnosis disease progression and or response to treatment .

Measurement of PKM2 in both feces and blood may better represent PKM2 arising from the IBD pathology namely the intestinal epithelium that is shed in feces and the concomitant immune system activation presented both locally at the intestine and systemi- cally.ConclusionsNewly diagnosed IBD patients have elevated serum PKM2 levels although PKM2 measured by ELISA cannot differentiate between the IBD phenotypes or disease localization.

Samples and controls were plated on a 96-well plate provided with the kit and read at 450 and 620 nm excitation and emission respectively using a Biotek Synergy HT mi- croplate reader Fisher Scientific Canada.PKM2 enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay ELISA in human IBD patientsSerum from thirty-three newly diagnosed IBD participants was collected and used to quantify PKM2 content.

Whether serum PKM2 is elevated in IBD is largely unknown and a necessary first step in its potential use as a biomarker for IBD.

This is consistent with reports of elevated fecal PKM2 differentiating between IBS and IBD but not the sub-classifications of IBD .

Dysbiosis in IBD favors an 8-fold increase in the mucosal associated bacteria aerobic and anaerobic in patients with IBD in comparison to asymptomatic patients .
