It has also been identified as a dominant genus in anaerobic NA-degrading cultures possibly play- ing a syntrophic role with methanogenic species in the degradation of NAs .It is interesting that Methanoregula was obviously enriched in both the PAHs and NAs media and even dominated the archaeal community 43 in the PAHs consortia and 30 in NAs.

Two rarely reported microorganisms a hydrogenotrophic methanogen Candidatus methanoregula anda saccharolytic fermenter Kosmotoga were found to be prevalent in the PAHs and OFPW microcosms and are likely to play an important role in the syntrophic degradation of PAHs and OFPW cooperating with methanogens such as Methanoregula Methanosarcina or Methanobacterium.Conclusions The dominant phyla varied in certain patterns during the incubations depending on the biomass source feed type and variation in nutrients.

c which reveal a clear evolution of the microbial community in the OG group but only a slight change in the mixed group.Microbiome dynamics in the NA consortiaFirmicutes were the dominant bacterial phylum Additional file  Figure S2 with a clear increase in its relative abundance from 3 day 0 to 54 with 50 BMP  150 mg L-1 NAs and 93 50BMP  500 mg L-1 NAs.

This hypothesis would agree with the results from the PAHs incubations with OG bio- mass Table .Microbiome dynamics in the OFPW consortiaIn the MS community 14 different phyla Additional file  Figure S3 were observed on day 42 and the dominant phyla were Chloroflexi Proteobacteria Thermotogaeand Synergistetes with a relative abundance of 30 18 16 and 13 respectively.

We used a batch incubation method accompanied by the next-generation sequencing tools to select and identify microbial commu- nities that contained desirable catabolic traits to degrade PAHs NAs and OFPW.

For the above reasons anacclimation process allows microorganisms to survive and remain active under unfavourable conditions and the lack of it could lead to bioaugmentation failures .ConclusionsIn this study we aimed to understand the systematic and taxonomical structure of the microbial consor- tia taking part in biodegrading PAHs NAs and OFPW and more importantly to learn how these communities evolved under different substrate pressures.

For exam- ple for the group incubated in 50 BMP  150 mg L-1 NAs the bacterial 16S gene copy concentration was 105 gene copies per gramme sludge while for the 50 BMP  500 mg L-1 NAs group the value was almost one order of magnitude lower.The mixed and OG sludge communities degrading NAs had been primed by degrading NAs prior to beingutilised for enrichment cultures.

b. Clostridium has frequently been reported as an abundant genus in AD microbial communities under either gentle  or near-extreme  conditions and it has been suggested that it produces gases acids alco- hols and surfactants in the enhanced microbial recovery of heavy oil .

For example the relative abundance of the Euryarchaeota group increased by 35 and 90 in the MS and OG communities respectively after 14-day incubations with PAHs while the total abundance of bacteria decreased accordingly Additional file  Figure S1.
