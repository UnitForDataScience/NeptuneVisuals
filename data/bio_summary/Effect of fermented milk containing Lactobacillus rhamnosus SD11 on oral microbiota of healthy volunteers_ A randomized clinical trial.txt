In our previous studies that screened potential probiotic strains of Lactobacillus strains derived from caries-free subjects we found that some strains for example Lactobacillus paracasei SD1 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus SD11 previously identified as Lactobacillus fermentum SD11 exhibited strong activity in inhibiting growth of oral pathogens by producing antimicrobial substances Teanpaisan et al.

However the po- tential benefits of probiotic L. rhamnosus SD11 on oral health require further evaluation with a larger group of volunteers in a longer-term study.Key words probiotics oral health mutans streptococci lactobacilliINTRODUCTIONProbiotics have been used for decades in fermented products such as fermented milk and it is accepted that probiotics can provide a health benefit such as in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and im- munological disorders Cremonini et al.

These findings indicate that L. rhamnosus SD11 may be an appropri- ate probiotic strain for oral the cavity because of its ability to adhere to human oral mucosa.The reason for the effect of probiotic L. rhamnosusSD11 on decreasing mutans streptococci and total bacteria counts is not fully known but might result from a combination of the strain's abilities to produce bacteriocin Wannun et al.

The main mechanism of action is based on enhancing the commensal microbiota and preventing colonization by true pathogens.Some Lactobacillus strains have been previously evaluated as potential probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases such as dental caries Cagetti et al.

Some studies have shown that oral administration of Lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic lozenges could be a useful adjunct to scaling and root planing in chronic peri- odontitis Teughels et al.

2016 and to adhere to human oral mucosa Piwat et al.

Subsequently it was found that Lactobacillus paracasei SD1 and L. rhamnosus SD11 produced bac- teriocins with molecular masses of 24028.2 and 33000 Da respectively Wannun et al.

The identity of the strain was further confirmed as L. rhamnosus SD11 by its 16S rRNA gene sequences the presence of a specific band at the same level of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with primers of CARP according to Piwat and Teanpaisan 2013 and lack of reaction with specific primers for L. fermentum strains Dickson et al.

Survival of a probiotic strain in the host as well as in the carrier is generally considered a key feature for probiotics to preserve their health- promoting effects.Among previously studied Lactobacillus rhamnosusstrains L. rhamnosus GG and L. rhamnosus LC 705 were commonly strains used in clinical trials for dental caries prevention Cagetti et al.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus SD11 persisted in the probiotic group 80 of subjects up to 4 wk fol- lowing cessation of dosing whereas L. rhamnosus GG could be detected in only 3.7 of subjects after 7 d of intervention Yli-Knuuttila et al.
