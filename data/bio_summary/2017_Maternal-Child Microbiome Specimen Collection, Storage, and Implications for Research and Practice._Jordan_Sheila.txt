Nurses hold the responsibility to both perform the research and to translate findings from microbiome investigations for clinical use.Keywordsmothers microbiome newborns pregnancy specimen handling specimen collectionCharacterization of the human microbiome--the ecological community of commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the human body--has become a topic of increased scientific study within the context of human health and disease Peterson et al.

These recent initiatives underscore the high level prioritization and importance placed on advancing human microbiome research.Much remains to be uncovered about the maternal-child microbiome however what appears to have been established--that the foundation of an individual's microbiome is set in the first two years of life--suggests that the optimization of maternal child health during this time is critical Yang et al.

Significant advances are occurring in the science of the maternal and child microbiome and hold promise in improving outcomes related to pregnancy complications child development and chronic health conditions of mother and child.Objectives--The purpose of the paper is to review site-specific considerations in the collection and storage of maternal and child microbiome samples and its implications for nursing research and practice.Approach--Microbiome sampling protocols were reviewed and synthesized.

2009.Furthermore the maternal microbiome is a key contributor in the initial microbial colonization and development of the infant microbiome which may have long-term implications for child physical and neurocognitive development Dominguez-Bello 2010 Yang et al.

Advances in these methodologies have resulted in increased scientific inquiry regarding the microbial diversity and metabolic and genetic potential of the human microbiome among select populations.A key step in accurately assessing the human microbiome involves the appropriate selection of collection methods and protocols to ensure accurate sampling and handling of biological samples to prevent biased results.

Samples from any of the oral microbiome sites should be frozen and stored at -80degC until analysis is conducted McInnes  Cutting 2010.Saliva Sample CollectionSaliva while part of the oral cavity provides a distinctive medium for the microbiome.

2012.Jordan et al.Page 5Gut MicrobiomeThe human intestinal microbiome is the most commonly investigated and the most complex of all human microbiome sites.

A promising field of microbiome research involving fecal transplant has proven successful in treating severe gastrointestinal GI infection Clostridium difficile and may be beneficial in treating other inflammatory GI disorders such as Crohn's disease Manges Steiner  Wright 2016.Gut Screening ConsiderationsAny investigation of the gut microbiome must consider multiple variables that impact microbiota composition host environment and habitual dietary intake.

2014 McInnes  Cutting 2010.Gut Sample CollectionAs with any sample collected for assessing the microbiome the method of gut microbiome collection should maximize the recovery of fecal microbial DNA while minimizing sampling bias and contamination Robinson et al.

This has been applied to the storage protocols of other microbiome studies as well Choo Leong  Rogers 2015.Vaginal MicrobiomeThe composition of the vaginal microbiome is instrumental in the development of several reproductive tract infections including bacterial vaginosis yeast infections urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections Haahr 2016 Jayaprakash Schellenberg  Hill 2012.
