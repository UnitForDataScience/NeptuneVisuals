it was suggested that the mechanisms involved in treg cell upregulation depended on 1 probiotics triggering tgf-b and il-10 production via tlr activation or the mediation of b-lactoglobulin hydrolysis 2 probiotics combining with lectin dendritic cells and stimulating gen- eration of treg cells capable of expressing high levels of il-10 3 probiotics activating g protein-coupled receptors on the surface of treg cells through immunomodulatory scfa upregulation 4 probiotics producing microbial polysaccharides to promote the naive cd4 t cells to differentiate into foxp3 treg cells.

we speculate that probiotics may influence olp by modulating oral microbial diversity and has the potential to be a promising target for therapy.influence of probiotics on antigen-specific mechanisms in olpeffects of probiotics on t cellsfollowing antigen presentation by mhc-i or mhc-ii molecules cd4 t helper cells and cd8 cytotoxic t cells are activated in olp lesions .

as a result of treg cell modulation probiotics may contribute to the inhibition of nf-kb and symptomatic alleviation of olp  .in conclusion probiotics have the potential to suppress t-cellactivation keratinocyte apoptosis and the infiltration and proliferation of cd4 t cells as well as induce the apoptosis of cd4 t cells and upregulate treg cells in olp all of which may benefit olp manage- ment.effects of probiotics on cytokinescytokines are small soluble peptides and that are secreted by many immune and non-immune cells  .

they are capable of modulating innate and adaptive immune responses through reduction of pathogenic microbes short-chain fatty acids scfas secretion a decrease in intestinal permeability or by direct interaction with the mucosal immune system  corresponding author at department of oral medicine school and hospital of stomatology wuhan university luoyu road 237 wuhan 430079 pr china.e-mail address g. zhou.r00e0ce3i-v9e9d699jcan2u0ar1y72e0ls1e7vierrecletdiv.eadllinrigrehvtsisreedsefrovremd.10 april 2017 accepted 21 april 2017. interestingly the immunoregulatory function of probiotics is quite different which indicates that probiotics regulate the immune response in a strain-specific manner   .

this article critically discusses the potential role probiotics may play in olp management via antigen-specific and non-specific me- chanisms related to the pathogenesis of olp.role of probiotics in oral microbial diversity and community modulationpast evidence suggests that the composition of the oral microbiome is implicated in olp .

in addition some studies demonstrated that certain strains of probiotics inhibited the infiltration and proliferation of cd4 t cells whereas cd4 t cell apoptosis was promoted by probiotics  .

therefore probiotics may promote olp treatment via suppression of nf-kb activation.influence of probiotics on micrornasmicrornas mirnas a class of 18-25 nucleotides in length single- stranded and non-coding rnas are involved in nearly one-third of all post-transcriptional gene expression through the matching of the untranslated region utr of the target messenger rna mrna  .

in conclusion probiotics modify the immune response by regulating microrna levels and this may have a therapeutic benefit for olp.influence of probiotics on antigen non-specific mechanisms in olpinhibition of mmps expressionmatrix metalloproteinases mmps include a family of at least 20 members of zinc-containing endo-proteinases that function to degrade extracellular matrix and basement membrane components  .

thus olp may benefit from probiotics for its inhibitory effect on mmp-9 which may restrain t-cell migration into the epithelium and suppress basement membrane disruption resulting from mmp-9.effects of probiotics on mast cellsa higher density of mast cells in olp has previously been reported    .

therefore probiotics may be valuable to olp management by exerting inhibitory effects on degranulation and activation of mast cells.amelioration of psychological symptoms by probiotics in olpit is believed that a bidirectional interaction exits between the brain and gut .

taken together probiotics may be useful in olp management through mitigating psychological issues which possibly can modify immune dysregulation lower pain severity and further increase pain tolerance in olp patients.potential adverse effects of probioticsalthough having the ability to modify the composition of the microbiota alleviate mental issues and regulate inflammatory pro- cesses probiotics are not absolutely free from potential risks  ff.

while the common adverse effects of probiotics are gastrointestinal symptoms sepsis fungemia and gastro- intestinal ischemia most of current evidence suggests probiotics are non-toxic.

probiotics are capable of modulating the immune response in a strain-specific manner.

furthermore probiotics can also modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines and micrornas inhibit mmp-9 expression and mast cell degranulation and ameliorate psychological problems all of which are involved in the pathogenesis of olp.

therefore we hypothesize that probiotics may be applicable to olp as a safe inexpensive and non-conventional therapy.introductionoral lichen planus olp is a common t-cell mediated chronic inflammatory disease affecting regions of the skin mouth genital mucosa scalp and nails and whose etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear requiring further exploration .
