It was suggested that the mechanisms involved in Treg cell upregulation depended on 1 probiotics triggering TGF-b and IL-10 production via TLR activation or the mediation of b-lactoglobulin hydrolysis 2 probiotics combining with lectin dendritic cells and stimulating gen- eration of Treg cells capable of expressing high levels of IL-10 3 probiotics activating G protein-coupled receptors on the surface of Treg cells through immunomodulatory SCFA upregulation 4 probiotics producing microbial polysaccharides to promote the naive CD4 T cells to differentiate into Foxp3 Treg cells.

We speculate that probiotics may influence OLP by modulating oral microbial diversity and has the potential to be a promising target for therapy.Influence of probiotics on antigen-specific mechanisms in OLPEffects of probiotics on T cellsFollowing antigen presentation by MHC-I or MHC-II molecules CD4 T helper cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells are activated in OLP lesions .

As a result of Treg cell modulation probiotics may contribute to the inhibition of NF-kB and symptomatic alleviation of OLP  .In conclusion probiotics have the potential to suppress T-cellactivation keratinocyte apoptosis and the infiltration and proliferation of CD4 T cells as well as induce the apoptosis of CD4 T cells and upregulate Treg cells in OLP all of which may benefit OLP manage- ment.Effects of probiotics on cytokinesCytokines are small soluble peptides and that are secreted by many immune and non-immune cells  .

Interestingly the immunoregulatory function of probiotics is quite different which indicates that probiotics regulate the immune response in a strain-specific manner   .

This article critically discusses the potential role probiotics may play in OLP management via antigen-specific and non-specific me- chanisms related to the pathogenesis of OLP.Role of probiotics in oral microbial diversity and community modulationPast evidence suggests that the composition of the oral microbiome is implicated in OLP .

In addition some studies demonstrated that certain strains of probiotics inhibited the infiltration and proliferation of CD4 T cells whereas CD4 T cell apoptosis was promoted by probiotics  .

Therefore probiotics may promote OLP treatment via suppression of NF-kB activation.Influence of probiotics on microRNAsMicroRNAs miRNAs a class of 18-25 nucleotides in length single- stranded and non-coding RNAs are involved in nearly one-third of all post-transcriptional gene expression through the matching of the untranslated region UTR of the target messenger RNA mRNA  .

In conclusion probiotics modify the immune response by regulating microRNA levels and this may have a therapeutic benefit for OLP.Influence of probiotics on antigen non-specific mechanisms in OLPInhibition of MMPs expressionMatrix metalloproteinases MMPs include a family of at least 20 members of zinc-containing endo-proteinases that function to degrade extracellular matrix and basement membrane components  .

Thus OLP may benefit from probiotics for its inhibitory effect on MMP-9 which may restrain T-cell migration into the epithelium and suppress basement membrane disruption resulting from MMP-9.Effects of probiotics on mast cellsA higher density of mast cells in OLP has previously been reported    .

Therefore probiotics may be valuable to OLP management by exerting inhibitory effects on degranulation and activation of mast cells.Amelioration of psychological symptoms by probiotics in OLPIt is believed that a bidirectional interaction exits between the brain and gut .
