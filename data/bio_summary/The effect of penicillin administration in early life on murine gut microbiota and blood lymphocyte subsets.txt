Moreover mice treated with penicillin demonstrated significantly elevated percentage of B cells median 10.5 vs 8.0 p 14 0.01 and decrease in the percentage of total CD4th cell median 75.4 vs 82.5 p 14 0.0039 with subsequent changes among subsets - increased percentage of regulatory T cells Treg T helper 1 Th1 and T helper 2 Th2 cells.Conclusion Our study showed significant effect of penicillin on B and T cells in peripheral blood of young mice.

21-days old mice just after the weaning were randomly divided into two groups study group e animals receiving penicillin dis- solved in drinking water n 14 10 and control group e mice receiving drinking water only n 14 10 ad libitum for 28 days.

Similar pattern of lymphocyte counts with decreased counts of CD4th cells in lymphoid organs but the same numbers of CD8th and CD19th as conventional colonized mice was reported in germ-free mice .

It would be interesting to prolong the experiment until the development of changes in mice body weight or autoimmune- related diseases.In summary the present work documents unique and signifi- cant effect of penicillin on B and T cells in peripheral blood of young mice.

Therefore the aim of the study was to determine the effect of penicillin treatment on gut microorganisms and immune system of mice.Methods 21-days old C57BL6Jcmdb male mice were treated with low-dose of penicillin study group or water only control group for 4 weeks.

Tissue and stool samples for histology or microbiome assessment and peripheral blood for CBC and flow cytometry evaluation were collected.Results We found high variability in microbiota composition at different taxonomic levels between littermate mice kept in the same conditions independently of treatment regimen.

Therefore the aim of our study was to determine the effect of early antibiotic penicillin exposition on gut micro- organisms and immune system of mice.Material and methodsAnimalsC57BL6Jcmdb male mice Medical University of Bialystok Bialystok Poland were maintained in specific pathogen-free SPF conditions.

Dose of the antibiotic 1 mg of penicillin1 g of body weight was deter- mined on the basis of previous literature data and assumption that daily consumption of water is 15 ml per 100 g of mice .

Body weight of each mouse was measured every fourth day.Sample collectionAfter 28 days mice were anesthetized and sacrificed.

Statistical sig- nificance was determined by U Mann-Whitney test p  0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsBody weight CBC and histological evaluationDuring the whole study period body weights of animals were within the range of growth for C57BL6Jcmdb male mice.
