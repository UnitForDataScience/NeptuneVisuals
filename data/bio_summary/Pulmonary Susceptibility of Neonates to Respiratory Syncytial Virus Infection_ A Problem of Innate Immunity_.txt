Our group and others have described major deficiencies in the func- tionality of DCs in neonatal lungs following RSV infection -As compared to adults cDCs are poorly represented in the lungs and in the lymph nodes of RSV-infected neonates with an increased proportion of a CD103 DC subset These neonatal DCs also have lower expression of the costim- ulatory molecule CD86 and thus are less effective in antigen presentation Moreover a poor pulmonary mobilization of pDCs potent producers of IFNab and a weak activation of the IFN-I pathway are described in RSV-infected neonatal mice IFN-I production is important not only toinduce antiviral responses but also to amplify proinflamma- tory responses in the lungs of adult mice It has been demonstrated that IFNa treatment or an increased lung DC number by adoptive transfer of adult pDCs or administration of a hematopoietic cell proliferation factor the Flt3 ligand Flt3-L reboots the IFN-I pathway upon RSV neonatal infection and decreases TH2-biased immunopathology uponadult reinfection Thus IFN-I production clearlyappears as a key factor in neonatal susceptibility to RSV infection The role of AMs in primary RSV infection only begins to be appreciated.

F and G are the only RSV proteins that induce neutralizing antibodies RSV is the commonest viral agent causing acute lower respiratory infection ALRI in infants a disease usually named bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is characterized by mucus hypersecretion and inflammatory cell infiltration into the airspaces leading to airway lumen narrowing RSV infection is the main cause of hospitalization for severe bronchiolitis and is responsible for important infant mortality in developing countries RSV is highly contagious and it isestimated that 95 of children have experienced at least one RSV infection before the age of two.

Yet little is known about innate immu- nity in the lungs of neonates and how it will imprint further acquired immunity to RSV.To better understand the immune pathways mobilized by RSV infection in infants and their long-term effects on the lungs a mouse model of neonatal infection has been developed in BALBc mice Mice infected under age 7 days neonatal mice develop an asthma-like pathology upon adult reinfection characterized by weight loss airway hyperresponsiveness mucus hypersecretion type 2 immune responses neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment and IL-13 and IL-4 secretion and airway remodelling Thereby as in human infants the age of neonatal mice at initial RSV infection determines the clinical outcome upon RSV reexposure at adult age.

Several studies have reported that neonatal AMs present an imma- ture phenotype upon RSV infection and this has been associated with TH2-biased airway immunopathologyupon adult reinfection AM differentiation is controlledby local IL-4 or IFNg secretion However in neonatal mice IFNg production is absent following RSV infection Furthermore it has been demonstrated that IFNg production during neonatal infection influences the outcome of RSV pathology upon adult reinfection Indeed it has been shown that intranasal injection of recombinant IFNg in neonatal RSV-infected mice induces a better AM activation characterized by the expression of CAM markers CD86 MHC II and CCR7 and mannose receptor- on neonatal AMs and reduced viral load in the lungs 4.3.

Innate immune responses to RSV are important to control the early phase of viral infection but also to influence the polarizationof anti-RSV immune responses and thus the outcome of RSV infection.

In TLR4-deficient C57BL10 ScCr mice RSV clearance as well as activation and recruit- ment of NK cells is impaired However RSV infection is not affected in another TLR4-deficient BALBc mice Human and murine pulmonary epithelial cells and macro- phages express a broad range of TLRs including TLR4 - Interestingly TLR4 signalling and IL-4Ra STAT6 and IFN-b pathway engagement in murine AMs promote a type 2 immune response in the course of RSV infection TLR2TLR6 complex is also involved in the detection of RSV but the mechanisms of sensing remain unknown.

This alarmin supports the increase in the ILC2 number and IL-13 production in the lungs of RSV-infected neonatal mice ILC2 can promote a switch towards a type 2 phenotype for AMs or lung DCs at a steady state or in a house dust mite-induced asthma model Concerning the IFN-I pathway neonatal pDCs display a poor pulmonary mobilization and a weak activation of the IFN-I pathway following RSV infection AMs are the main source of IFN-I in RSV-infected adult lungs but the question remains open during the neonatal period Therefore it is strongly suspected that ILC2 cells are indirectly responsible for the inability of neonatal mice to mount an effective IFN-I response to counteract RSV infection.

RSV infection in neonatal mice promotes a type 2 immunity characterized by a strongproliferation of an IL-4Ra-CD4 TH2 subset together with a defect in CD8 T cell activation and IFNg production In this part we describe the first innate responses of pulmonary resident cells to RSV infection that contrib- ute to the development andor maintenance of anti-RSVTH2 immunity Figure Adaptive immune responses are initiated by DCs thattraffic from the infected lungs to the draining respiratory lymph nodes in order to prime T cell responses.

have demonstrated that neo-natal AMs present a delay of their differentiation toward a CAM phenotype following RSV infection likely due to unde- tectable IFNg production In adult mice RSV infection induces AAMs that are important to reduce lung pathology Thus pulmonary AM polarization seems to depend on age.

IL-33 plays a major function in the immunopathogenesis of RSV infection by supporting an increase in the ILC2 number and IL-13 production in the lungs of neonatal mice that will impact on disease severity in reinfected mice Additionally it has been reported that hospitalized infants with viral bronchiolitis have detectable levels of nasal IL-13 IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin TSLP Impor- tantly TSLP-deficient adult mice are unable to mount ILC2 proliferation and activation upon RSV infection The link between TSLP from respiratory epithelium and ILC2 proliferationactivation is not yet reported in RSV-infected neonatal mice.
