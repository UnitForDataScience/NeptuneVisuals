our group and others have described major deficiencies in the func- tionality of dcs in neonatal lungs following rsv infection -as compared to adults cdcs are poorly represented in the lungs and in the lymph nodes of rsv-infected neonates with an increased proportion of a cd103 dc subset these neonatal dcs also have lower expression of the costim- ulatory molecule cd86 and thus are less effective in antigen presentation moreover a poor pulmonary mobilization of pdcs potent producers of ifnab and a weak activation of the ifn-i pathway are described in rsv-infected neonatal mice ifn-i production is important not only toinduce antiviral responses but also to amplify proinflamma- tory responses in the lungs of adult mice it has been demonstrated that ifna treatment or an increased lung dc number by adoptive transfer of adult pdcs or administration of a hematopoietic cell proliferation factor the flt3 ligand flt3-l reboots the ifn-i pathway upon rsv neonatal infection and decreases th2-biased immunopathology uponadult reinfection thus ifn-i production clearlyappears as a key factor in neonatal susceptibility to rsv infection the role of ams in primary rsv infection only begins to be appreciated.

several studies have reported that neonatal ams present an imma- ture phenotype upon rsv infection and this has been associated with th2-biased airway immunopathologyupon adult reinfection am differentiation is controlledby local il-4 or ifng secretion however in neonatal mice ifng production is absent following rsv infection furthermore it has been demonstrated that ifng production during neonatal infection influences the outcome of rsv pathology upon adult reinfection indeed it has been shown that intranasal injection of recombinant ifng in neonatal rsv-infected mice induces a better am activation characterized by the expression of cam markers cd86 mhc ii and ccr7 and mannose receptor- on neonatal ams and reduced viral load in the lungs 4.3. promoting the maturation of the pulmonary immune system by modulating the microbiota.

yet little is known about innate immu- nity in the lungs of neonates and how it will imprint further acquired immunity to rsv.to better understand the immune pathways mobilized by rsv infection in infants and their long-term effects on the lungs a mouse model of neonatal infection has been developed in balbc mice mice infected under age 7 days neonatal mice develop an asthma-like pathology upon adult reinfection characterized by weight loss airway hyperresponsiveness mucus hypersecretion type 2 immune responses neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment and il-13 and il-4 secretion and airway remodelling thereby as in human infants the age of neonatal mice at initial rsv infection determines the clinical outcome upon rsv reexposure at adult age.

this alarmin supports the increase in the ilc2 number and il-13 production in the lungs of rsv-infected neonatal mice ilc2 can promote a switch towards a type 2 phenotype for ams or lung dcs at a steady state or in a house dust mite-induced asthma model concerning the ifn-i pathway neonatal pdcs display a poor pulmonary mobilization and a weak activation of the ifn-i pathway following rsv infection ams are the main source of ifn-i in rsv-infected adult lungs but the question remains open during the neonatal period therefore it is strongly suspected that ilc2 cells are indirectly responsible for the inability of neonatal mice to mount an effective ifn-i response to counteract rsv infection.

suggested that boosting the antiviral response of pdcs during the neonatal period limits rsv pathology additionally the treatment of neonatal mice with the flt3-l a growth factor for hematopoietic cells before rsv infection increases pdcs in the lungs partially restores the ifn-i pathway and reduces the long-term path- ological pulmonary consequences of rsv infection however ams have been identified as predominant pro- ducers of ifn-i in rsv-infected adult mice therefore the role of these cells in neonates and in the developmenttable 1 biological therapeutic interventions to modulate neonatal innate immunity following rsv infection.strategytargetdesignbiological productcategoryadministrationmodelsref.counteracting the ineffective ifn-i secretionifn-i-producing cellsactivation recruitmentifn-i and flt3-lrifn-a and growth factorinhalation injectionmouse nifn-i signallingactivationcpg and sb 9200tlr or rlr agonistoralmouse a  nmodulating the pulmonaryth2-polarizing cytokinesblockinganti-il-13 anti-tslpanti-il-33anti-il-4ra andantibodiesinjectionhuman a  mouse a  nantisense oligonucleotide-th2 biassignalling pathwaysblockinganti-stat6and inhibitory peptideinhalationmouse nalveolar macrophagesactivationifngrifnginhalationmouse nmodulating the mucosalrespiratory  intestinal mucosamaturationlactobacillus rhamnosuscrl1505live or heat-killed bacteria oral or inhalation human c mouse n-microbiotaa adult c children n neonate.respiratory mucosamaturationprimocolonizing lungbacteria strainslive bacteriainhalationmouse nof pulmonary anti-rsv immunity in the long term should not be ignored.promoting ifn-i signalling via tlrrlr agonists.

il-33 plays a major function in the immunopathogenesis of rsv infection by supporting an increase in the ilc2 number and il-13 production in the lungs of neonatal mice that will impact on disease severity in reinfected mice additionally it has been reported that hospitalized infants with viral bronchiolitis have detectable levels of nasal il-13 il-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp impor- tantly tslp-deficient adult mice are unable to mount ilc2 proliferation and activation upon rsv infection the link between tslp from respiratory epithelium and ilc2 proliferationactivation is not yet reported in rsv-infected neonatal mice.

rsv- infected adult mice receiving an anti-tslp neutralizing antibody presented a reduction in il-13 production as well as a decrease in viral load and airway mucus secretion furthermore administration of anti-tslp before neonatal rsv infection has been shown to reduce ox40-l expressionon dcs thereby reducing their capacity to promote th2 polarization and to decrease eosinophil numbers in the bron- choalveolar lavage fluids both strategies anti-il-13 andanti-tslp are currently under clinical trial evaluation for adult patients with asthma in the same way the administration of an il-33-neutralizing antibody during primary rsv infection in neonatal mice reduces il-13 production and ilc2 numbers in the lungs and consequently decreases disease severity after reinfection at adult age modulating by blocking signalling pathways involved in the type 2 immunity induction.

altogether in the particular context of the neonatal airway environment it becomes important to understand the mechanism that triggers the polarization of neonatal ams following rsv infection and to evaluate its relationship with exacerbated airway responses upon adult reinfection.the contribution of ilc2 and il-33 to the neonatal rsv susceptibility has been recently investigated.

subse- quently long-term respiratory disorders associated with rsv reinfection are reduced by the neonatal administration of il-4ra aso in accordance with these results the inhibition of stat6 activity an essential transcription factor in il-4ra signalling by a specific inhibitory peptide during neonatal rsv infection decreases il-4 secretion and aam number in the lungs and prevents from pulmonary eosino- phil recruitment and airway hyperresponsiveness upon adult rsv reinfection modulating by activation of neonatal ams.

f and g are the only rsv proteins that induce neutralizing antibodies rsv is the commonest viral agent causing acute lower respiratory infection alri in infants a disease usually named bronchiolitis bronchiolitis is characterized by mucus hypersecretion and inflammatory cell infiltration into the airspaces leading to airway lumen narrowing rsv infection is the main cause of hospitalization for severe bronchiolitis and is responsible for important infant mortality in developing countries rsv is highly contagious and it isestimated that 95 of children have experienced at least one rsv infection before the age of two.
