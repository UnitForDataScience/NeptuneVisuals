In conclusion we demonstrate that arsenic exposure at an environmentally relevant dose not only perturbed the communal composition of the gut microbiome but also profoundly altered a variety of important bacterial functional pathways.Key words arsenic gut microbiome metagenomics functional pathways.Trillions of symbiotic microbiota reside in the gastrointestinal tract where they play essential regulatory roles in human me- tabolism aEUR .

Increased abundances of bacterial vitamin biosynthesis genes may protect the gut microbiome against arsenic-induced stress and facilitate arsenic detoxification.Multidrug Resistance Genes and Conjugative Transposon Protein Genes Were Highly Enriched in the Gut Microbiome Following Exposure to ArsenicWe next investigated whether arsenic exposure would increase heavy metal resistance in the gut microbiome.

Previously we have first demonstrated that arsenic alters the composition of the gut microbiome.

However the functional impact of arsenic on the gut microbiome has not been adequately assessed particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations.

In this study we used 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomics sequencing to investigate how exposure to 100 ppb arsenic for 13 weeks alters the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiome in mice.

Moreover lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes multiple stress response genes and DNA repair genes were significantly increased in the gut microbiome of arsenic- exposed mice.

However the gut microbiome is a highly dynamic system that is affected by many xenobiotics such as antibiotics and heavy metals which influence its normal composition and therefore its functionsVC The Author 2017.
