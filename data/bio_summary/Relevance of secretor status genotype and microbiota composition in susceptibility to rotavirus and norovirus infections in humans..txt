The expected link between secretor status and susceptibility to RV and NoV was found and multivariate analyses showed that secretor status the microbiota and viral susceptibility are interdependent for both RV and NoV.

The plot showed clearly different groups in the microbial compositions between the non-secretors and the secretors at the phenotype and the genotype level although without significant differences and B p  0.05.We found that both anti-NoV and anti-RV IgA levels significantly explained the variations in the gut micro-bial composition associated to FUT2 secretor status p  0.040 and p  0.014 respectively on the CCA  analysis 3C confirming the hypothesis that all three factors secretor status microbiota and susceptibility to RV and NoV are interdependent.In order to seek out the relationships between specific bacterial groups and susceptibility to RV and NoV infections in humans a Pearson correlation analysis was performed showing a potential link between gutFigure 3.

A trend-like correlation was only observed for RV which may account for the higher variability of RV depending on secretor status which is based on viral genotype as has been described for P8 and P6 RV variants.NoV and RV infections depend on the gut microbiotaand on secretor status while the gut microbiota is also simultaneously dependent on secretor status.

Different results were found among the different bacterial groups with regard to susceptibility to RV a positive correlation was found at the genus level R  0.5513 p  0.0006 between Akkermansia and susceptibility to RV 6C.

A negative correlation was found between two different Ruminococcaceae OTUs Ruminococcaceae44932 R  -0.3623 p  0.032 and Ruminococcaceae20617 R  -0.357 p  0.035 and susceptibility to RV infections.DiscussionRecent research findings on the involvement of intestinal bacteria in NoV and RV infections have established that the microbiota plays a pivotal role in viral susceptibility.
