MICROBIOME A bag of surprisesOnce thought to be sterile the bladder contains microbes that could influence the development and treatment ofcancer.that in contrast to urine left open to the air urine contained in sealed vials did not become clouded with growing microbes.

A micro- biome reflects a community of bacteria that have a functional relationship to each other or to their host environment says Rembert Pieper who studies infectious diseases at the J. Craig Venter Institute.When it comes to microbes in the bladder that's very difficult to prove.One difficulty when studying urinary microbes is that although they occur in many people they are generally found in low numbers.

But such meth- ods detect only microbes that thrive under culture conditions and miss those that do not.

If unculturable microbes were present in the bladder they would not be detected.The same used to be true of other parts of the body such as the gut.

Suspicious that they were missing something researchers in the mid-2000s applied 'culture-independent' methods originally developed to find uncul- turable microbes in environmental samples to body parts.

It can reveal all the microbial genes in a sample as well as the metabolic pathways they encode but it sometimes fails to detect microbes that are present in low numbers.These techniques have been used on various body sites including the gut skin vagina and mouth as part of the Human Microbiome Project which was launched in 2008.

At the time bacteria were known mainly as a cause of urinary-tract infections and microbes in the gut had been implicated in kidney stones.

The dogma that urine and by extension the bladder must be sterile to be healthy has been overturned and microbes are being discovered throughout the urinary system.

Although still at the early discovery stage research into the bladder's microbes promises to transform understanding of the urinary tract.

It's really grown and exploded rapidly says Burton.CLOUDED JUDGEMENTThe idea that healthy urine is sterile dates back to the mid-nineteenth century when early microbiologists such as Louis Pasteur showeduntil 2012 when researchers published results of 16S rRNA sequencing studies on urine sam- ples and found evidence of microbes in people without urinary-tract infections.
