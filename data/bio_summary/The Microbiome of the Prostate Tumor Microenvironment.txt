a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the microbial ecosystem of the pathologic and healthy prostate tissues has not been yet reported.objectives to characterize the microbiome possibly associated to the pathologic pros- tate microenvironment.design setting and participants the microbiome profile of tumor peri-tumor and nontumor tissues was assessed on 16 radical prostatectomy-specimens.outcome measurements and statistical analysis microbiome analysis was assessed by massive ultradeep pyrosequencing.

the advent of molecular-based methods of identification and characterization of complex microbial populations ie microbiome analysis has led to a new era of microbial discovery thus unveiling important associations between the microbiome composition and several pathological conditions such as chronic inflammation colon cancerdiabetes and obesity .while inflammation has been proposed to play an important role over malignant and benign prostatic growth potential stimuli that either induce or maintain tissue inflammation still remain poorly characterized.

average distribution of major taxa is represented by bar graphs a phylum b class c order d family e genus.as for the microbiome analyses less abundant groups or taxa  1 in all samples were excluded.based on homology searches and taking into account only phyla detectable in at least one of the three sampled regions we observed the prostate microbiome is enriched by actinobacteria as the dominant phylum in all types of samples followed by firmicutes and proteobacteria a .possible misleading differences in total bacterial load among prostate specimens were excluded since the quantification by real-time polymerase chain reaction of the bacterial presence as defined using the 16s copynumber per microgram of extracted dna was not statisti- cally different intrasample and intersample data not shown.to deepen our research we also performed analysis at class order family and genera levels and when possible we typed the bacteria to the species level.

besides confirming the presence of a local prostate-specific microbiome  along with the overall nonsterile environment of the prostate we were able to ascribe a certain microbiome profile specifically to a certain histological tissue type.due to the unavailability of normal healthy prostate specimens we used the nontumoral area selected within the tumoral prostate specimens.

if on the one hand this is a limit on the other hand the comparison of matched t pt and nt areas minimized interpatient confounding factorssuch as diet or lifestyle which are already known to significantly impact microbiome composition .the similarity in the microbiome profile observed among the areas was not surprising due to the narrow proximity of the lesions and the field-effect.

multivariate analysis shows that the microbiome of the prostate is similar among the patients and that the samples from the three prostate areas do not cluster by their overall microbiome composition.

however despite the growing body of literature reporting the composition of the microbiome in various body niches and clinical conditions  a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the microbial ecosystem of the pathologic and healthy prostate tissues has not been reported yet.

these considerations prompted us to characterize the microbiome associated with the nontumor peri-tumor and tumor tissue of the human prostate by using massive ultradeep pyrosequencing in order to assess its relevance upon the pathogenesis of pca.materials and methodspatient selection and specimen processingprostate specimens from 16 white caucasian nondiabetic nonobese pca patients submitted to radical prostatectomy at the same institutebetween 2011 and 2013 were considered for these analyses supple- mentary table 1. patients with self-reported lower urinary tract symptoms or a pathologic international prostate symptom score were excluded.

no significant correlation between the microbial burden at each taxonomic level and the extent of intraprostatic inflammation and the inflammatory cell density the prostate-specific antigen levels and the gleason score was observed data not shown.discussionin this study we have characterized for the first time the microbiome of the pathological prostate by using an ultradeep pyrosequencing approach.

moreover the characterization of the pt region- associated microbiome allowed us to add on the concept that specific microbial populations may find in the pathological prostate niche the favorable soil to set themselves and outcompete other species.

indeed the microbiome profile associated to the pt region was more similar to the t with respect to the nt region thus indicating a possible role of the pca extracellular environ- ment in favoring the establishment of specific microbial populations.

however the gradual difference in microbiome among areas suggests at least a noncasual correlation of importance it also reduces the risk of results due to sampling artefacts.

in nt areas supports the concept that this member of lactobacillales may belong to the normal prostate microbiome ecosystem and may help to maintain a physiological and beneficial relationship with the host extracellular environment.

although remote since the composition of the colon microbiome is completely different this would remain a limit also in potential prospective studies due to the difficulty to obtain consent for extra biopsies to be devoted to research from diagnostic sampling.within each tumor specimen the area with the highest- grade tumor has been sampled.
