We aimed to profile the placental microbiota of GDM and further define whether or not certain placental microbiota taxon correlates with specific clinical characteristics.

Given that GDM is a high risk factor of multiple adverse outcomes we aimed to study the placental microbiota in GDM and further define whether or notcertain placental microbiota taxon correlates with specific clinical characteristics.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy Subjects and Eligibility CriteriaThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital PUMCH No S-003 and the study conformed to the relevant regulatory standards.

Each placental sample was placed in a sterile labeled cryovial then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at-80C for DNA extraction and further microbiota analysis.DNA Extraction PCR Amplification and SequencingDNA was isolated from placental biopsies using the E.Z.N.A.QR DNA Kit Omega Bio-tek Norcross GA USA in a sterile class II laminar flow hood following the standard protocol.

The heatmap also demonstrated that microbial structures at genus level of placentas differed significantly between GDM and non-GDM women with normal pregnancies Figure 2.To compare overall placental microbiota structure in pregnant women with GDM and non-GDM women PCoA according to OTUs of each sample were implemented to provide a glimpse of placental microbial dynamics between GDM and non-GDM groups.

However the associations between human placental microbiota and GDM are poorly understood.

Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated using magnetic beads and the human placental microbiota was analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System based on the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene.

We found that the placental microbiota is composed of four dominant phyla from Proteobacteria the most abundant Bacteroidetes Actinobacteria and Firmicutes with the proportion of Proteobacteria increased and Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were decreased of women with GDM.

In conclusion our novel study showed that a distinct placental microbiota profile is present in GDM and is associated with clinical characteristics of mothers and infants.

This study contributes to the theoretical foundation on the potential relationship between placental microbiota and GDM.Keywords gestational diabetes mellitus placenta microbiota 16S rRNA gene clinical characteristicsINTRODUCTIONObesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM is increasing rapidly.

found a unique placental microbiome profile composed of non-pathogenic commensal microbiota and were most akin to the oral microbiome Aagaard et al.
