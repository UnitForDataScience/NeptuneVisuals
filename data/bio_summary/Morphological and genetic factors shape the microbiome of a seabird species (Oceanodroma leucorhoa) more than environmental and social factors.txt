There are several physiological dif- ferences between male and female brood patches even in bird species where both sexes including LESPs con- tribute to incubation activities For example in Zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata the female brood patch transfers more heat to the egg than the male brood patch Male Reed warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus increase egg temperature during incubation at a faster rate than females and male Yellow-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes have higher brood patch temperatures than females  While unstudied in LESPs variation in temperature ranges between male and female brood patches is a possible contributor to microbial variation at that location.

By understanding more about bird microbiota predictive tipping points in microbial communities of at-risk bird species or economically important recre- ational bird species could aid in proactive prevention of damaging pathogenic disease.Individual effects on petrel-associated microbiota petrel microbiota differ by body site and sexCore taxa colonizing the uropygial gland and brood patch sites of LESPs belonged to the phyla Proteobac- teria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.

Three hundred OTUs were identified as associated with Archaea chloroplasts and mitochon- dria which were also removed from the dataset After splitting the OTU table by sample type the result- ing swab and soil datasets were rarefied to 9000 and 30000 sequences per sample respectively to equalize sequence reads and reduce bias in community richness and diversity  Following sequence processing a total of 13 female uropygial gland 14 female brood patch 8 male uropygial gland 7 male brood patch and 25 burrow samples deep mid and surface soil for each burrow remained in the dataset Additional file Table S1.

They lay a single egg per breeding season that is incubated by one parent while the other forages at sea in shifts that last up to 6 days  Four specific hypotheses were tested with respect to the microbiome of LESPs 1 Uropygial gland and brood patch sites are colonized by significantly different bacter- ial communities 2 genetic diversity with respect to sex and MHC heterozygosity influences the composition of bacterial communities at these sites 3 birds share more bacterial taxa with their own home burrow than with a random non-home burrow indicating an effect of local habitat on the microbiome and 4 mated pairs of birds share more bacterial taxa with each other than with non-mates indicating an effect of social behavior on the microbiome.

While several terrestrial bird microbiome studies have been conducted this is the first examin- ation of the external microbiome of a seabird and the first study to include the avian brood patch as a site of investigation.Feathers and skin are particularly of interest be- cause they are the first barrier between a bird's body and the environment.

While still a lowpercentage this indicates that the marine environment is likely an equal or greater contributor to the microbiome of LESPs than burrow soil and does not account for marine-associated bacterial species that have yet to be discovered LESPs often make long foraging trips to sea that can last up to 6 days and acquire food at the ocean surface where they are exposed to ocean water and marine bacteria.

As a result uropygial gland microbial communities may be individu- ally specific from bird to bird aiding in recognition and potentially mate selection based on genotypic fitness.The brood patch is another body site of importance in avian species.

Morphometric measurements including bird mass g tarsal length mm and wing chord length mm were recorded.While the bird was held out of the burrow soil sam- ples were collected using sterilized 1-cm corers from three locations deep within the burrow the entrance of the burrow and 30 cm away from the burrow entrance hereafter deep mid and surface soils respectively Add- itional file Figure S2B.
