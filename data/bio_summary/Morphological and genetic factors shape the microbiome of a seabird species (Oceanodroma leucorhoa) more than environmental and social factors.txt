they lay a single egg per breeding season that is incubated by one parent while the other forages at sea in shifts that last up to 6 days  four specific hypotheses were tested with respect to the microbiome of lesps 1 uropygial gland and brood patch sites are colonized by significantly different bacter- ial communities 2 genetic diversity with respect to sex and mhc heterozygosity influences the composition of bacterial communities at these sites 3 birds share more bacterial taxa with their own home burrow than with a random non-home burrow indicating an effect of local habitat on the microbiome and 4 mated pairs of birds share more bacterial taxa with each other than with non-mates indicating an effect of social behavior on the microbiome.

by understanding more about bird microbiota predictive tipping points in microbial communities of at-risk bird species or economically important recre- ational bird species could aid in proactive prevention of damaging pathogenic disease.individual effects on petrel-associated microbiota petrel microbiota differ by body site and sexcore taxa colonizing the uropygial gland and brood patch sites of lesps belonged to the phyla proteobac- teria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria.

there are several physiological dif- ferences between male and female brood patches even in bird species where both sexes including lesps con- tribute to incubation activities for example in zebra finches taeniopygia guttata the female brood patch transfers more heat to the egg than the male brood patch male reed warblers acrocephalus scirpaceus increase egg temperature during incubation at a faster rate than females and male yellow-eyed penguins megadyptes antipodes have higher brood patch temperatures than females  while unstudied in lesps variation in temperature ranges between male and female brood patches is a possible contributor to microbial variation at that location.

burrow soil bacterial communities differed by depth and by averaging all values at all body sites birds shared the greatest amount of otus 4.6 - 0.98 with the microbial community in the deep burrow soil samples where the nest is located table p  0.02 n  22. male and female birds shared a similar percentage of otus with deep burrow soil regard- less of body site p  0.5 n  22.since lesps spend most of their time in flight over the ocean or interacting with marine water to forage oceanic microorganisms may also be an environmental source of diversity to their microbiome.

while several terrestrial bird microbiome studies have been conducted this is the first examin- ation of the external microbiome of a seabird and the first study to include the avian brood patch as a site of investigation.feathers and skin are particularly of interest be- cause they are the first barrier between a bird's body and the environment.

however total within-sample alpha diversity including both swab loca- tions was higher in female birds shannon index4.66 - 0.181 than male birds shannon index4.17 - 0.356. this difference was driven by significantly higher diversity at female brood patches wilcoxon rank- sum test shannon index w  79 p  0.025 than the male brood patches but uropygial sites had similar diver- sity in both sexes w  72 p  0.162. between-sex bacter- ial communities were structurally different at the brood patch sites pseudo-f  1.5884 p  0.03 n  21 and uro- pygial glands pseudo-f  2.3323 p  0.005 n  21. sim- per analysis which identifies otus that differ most in relative abundance between samples indicated that otus within the families pseudomonadaceae moraxellaceae corynebacteriaceae methylobacteriaceae and sphingomo- nadaceae were most responsible for the structural differ- ences observed in uropygial gland communities between males and females.

as a result uropygial gland microbial communities may be individu- ally specific from bird to bird aiding in recognition and potentially mate selection based on genotypic fitness.the brood patch is another body site of importance in avian species.

the communities on these swabs were distinctly different from the others collected in this study indicating that the frozen storage conditions maintained sample integrity.soil characteristicsfor each soil sample ph percent soil moisture nitrate no- and ammonium nh concentrations were mea-were conducted using each kit to control for contamin- ant dna associated with the extractions.

this is a highly vascularized ventral body site that enables birds to regulate egg temperature and likely transfers microbial communities to eggs and chicks  this important first inoculation of mi- crobes may be comparable to the birth process in mam- mals which is known to impact microbial colonization and immune system development later in life given these physiological differences it is likely that the uro- pygial gland and brood patch sites carry very different microbial communities but no studies to date have ex- amined the microbiomes of multiple skin locations in any avian species.while topographical differences in microbiota are likely across bird body sites between-bird individualizedmicrobiomes may be shaped by several factors.

three hundred otus were identified as associated with archaea chloroplasts and mitochon- dria which were also removed from the dataset after splitting the otu table by sample type the result- ing swab and soil datasets were rarefied to 9000 and 30000 sequences per sample respectively to equalize sequence reads and reduce bias in community richness and diversity  following sequence processing a total of 13 female uropygial gland 14 female brood patch 8 male uropygial gland 7 male brood patch and 25 burrow samples deep mid and surface soil for each burrow remained in the dataset additional file table s1.

morphometric measurements including bird mass g tarsal length mm and wing chord length mm were recorded.while the bird was held out of the burrow soil sam- ples were collected using sterilized 1-cm corers from three locations deep within the burrow the entrance of the burrow and 30 cm away from the burrow entrance hereafter deep mid and surface soils respectively add- itional file figure s2b.
