Mean percent of substantial individual bacterial groups positive for bacteria for each person was nearly the same over time with 72 74 76 72 at the control days accordingly.The patterns in distribution of single bacterial groups over the stool cylinder differed depending on the species but remained the same in the mucus close transient zone and in the center of the fecal cylinder regardless of humic acids supplementation.DISCUSSIONof the essential bacterial groups observed in our study was due to suppression of Bacteroides and probably further resulted from the fact that essential bacterial groups are already normally maximal promoted by the host and their growth cannot be endlessly boosted.Aside of the numeric impact on the microbiome we do not know which clinical effects humic acids promoted since all test persons were healthy and all except one tolerated Activominr without negative or apparent positive health effects.However reduced diversity and concentrations of colonic microbiota were demonstrated in IBD9 IBS and nongastroenterological diseases such as obesity diabetes rheumatism and multiple sclerosis1013.

Humic acids and colonic microbiomeone FISH probes representing different bacterial groups were used.RESULTSThe sum concentration of colonic microbiota in- creased from 20 at day 10 to 30 by day 31 and remained stable until day 45 32 of humic acid supplementation P  0.001.

They are obviously essential for colonic biofermentation.All other bacterial groups are individual present only in some of the subjects in substantial concentrations mean  0.1 x 109mL or marginal concentrations mean  0.1 x 109mL.Four FISH probes including Bif153 Bifidobac teriaceae Cdif198 Clostridium difficile Ebac1790 Enterobacteriaceae and Clit135 Clostridium litu seburense represent individual bacterial groups with pioneer function which are found prevalent in newborns after antibiotic treatment and convalescence patients but are seldom found in low concentration in healthy persons.Statistical analysisDifferences between groups were evaluated using the twosided tStudent U test.

The con- centrations of pioneer groups of Bifidobacteriaceae  Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium difficile increased but the observed differences were statistically not significant.CONCLUSIONHumic acids have a profound effect on healthy colonic microbiome and may be potentially interesting sub- stances for the development of drugs that control the innate colonic microbiome.Key words Fluorescence in situ hybridization Colonic microbiota Colonic bioreactor Humic acids Healthy volunteers Oral supplementationc The Authors 2017.

However such transfections are difficult to control and do not guarantee that the transferred microorganisms prevail settle and proliferate in the colon14.Humic acids exert profound effects on the colonic microbiota and may be an interesting group of sub stances for the development of specific drugs which deliberately influence colonic fermentation in an inflamed colon obesity rheumatic and neurologic disorders.BackgroundPatients demonstrate increasing interest in medical treatments that are not part of mainstream medicine.

Humic acids and colonic microbiomeThe response to humic acids of single bacterial groups was principally the same as in all functional sets of substantial bacteria.

The increase occurred in the preexisting microbial groups without changes in the bacterial diversity of the microbiome.ApplicationsThe main message of our study is that humic acids may be an interesting substrate for the development of defined drugs which deliberately control colonic fermentation in conditions where it is suppressed post-antibiotics convalescence or altered metabolic disorders inflammation obesity etc.
