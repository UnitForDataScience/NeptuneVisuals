e. these bacteria shifted the overall structure of the gut microbiota that had been dis- turbed by the hfd towards that of lean mice fed a normal diet this is consistent with the finding that overall microbes may directly influence fatty acid uptake and satiety responses either through regu- lation of enteroendocrine cell numbers or through direct regulation of gut peptide hormone production and secretion our data revealed that tnf-a and il-6 levels in the serum of the hfsd group were sig- nificantly increased compared to those of the group fed the normal diet table however when given the probiotic mixture the levels of these cytokines in the hfsd group returned to normal.intestinal microorganisms affect cellular metabolism in different hepatic and adipose tissues outside the gut in this way they can control the glucose and lipid homeostasis and the general inflammatory status of their host ingestion of a high-fat diet produces modifications within the intestinal microbiota and in- creases gut-derived inflammatory agents by renewing bowel flora in conditions of high fat diet-induced steato- sis.

the group given the probiotic mixture displayed improved levels of these hepatic markers when compared to thehfsd-only group table furthermore the hfsd-fed group showed significant increases in serum leptin and resistin hormone levels compared to the group fed the normal diet table administering the probiotic mix- ture appeared to regulate these hormonal imbalances.

the hfsd rats displayed significant increases in levels of tg tc p  0.001 and serum ldl p  0.01 while also showing a significant decrease in levels of hdl p  0.01 compared to rats fed the normal diet table the group that was fed the probiotic mixture showed significantly improved serum tg tc and ldl levels compared to the group that was fed the hfsd only table there were also a significant increases in alt activity and in total and direct bilirubin in the hfsd group compared to the normal group this indicated the deleterious impact of the hfsd on hepatocytes.

figure illustrates the return of normal structure in the hepatic cells of the probiotic-receiving group.concerning nafld score normal group had 0 score for 90 of the cases and hfsd group revealed an in- creases in the number of cases in the score 1 followed by 2 mild to moderate steatosis while probiotics group presented increases in the number of cases in score 0 and 1 that indicate improve in the steatosis score table discussiona mixture of probiotic strains was expected to have a greater benefit on the health of the host than a single- strain probiotic due to their presumed synergistic effectstable 1 effects of normal diet and hfsd on body weight in ratsnormalhfsdhfsd  probioticinitial body weight g109.4 - 4.52101.6 - 2.22101.6 - 2.22 final body weight gain227.9 - 15.36a268.7 - 8.450b238.7 - 9.43a mean body weight gain60.03 - 4.05a71.78 - 2.90b64.

the nature of the diet ingested especially with high-fatdiets can lead to endotoxemia which results from in- creased bacterial lps amounts in the blood stimu- lation of fat cells with lps or with different kinds of fatty acids palmitic myristic or linoleic acids has shown that palmitic and stearic acids are capable of gen- erating inflammation either alone or synergistically with lps however these fatty acids combined with lps in- duce greater increases in il-6 levels than does lps alone fatty acids either short or long chain saturated or unsaturated can affect the stimulation of immunological cells in the intestine which in turn can produce variousinflammatory reaction patterns for example long-chain saturated fatty acids bind to toll-like receptor4 tlr-4 and induce pro-inflammatory cytokine ex- pression in macrophages .

moreover nafld in the hfsd-fed group resulted in significant increases in il-6 and tnf-a levels compared to the groups fed the normal diet while the group that was given the probiotic mixture appeared to recover from these changes.a photograph showing high fat deposition around the gut and an enlarged liver is presented in fig.

the negative control group 20 rats was fed the standard rat chow diet for the duration of the experi- ment 16 weeks and the hfsd group 40 rats was maintained on the hfsd.probiotic treatmentfrom weeks 12-16 the treatment phase the hfsd group n  40 was divided into two groups.

administration of probiotic restore the normal microbiota therefore improve nafld via inhibition of lipogenesis and inflammatory markers.the hepatic histopathological studies showed multiple fat globules mild to moderate macro and microvesicular steatosis degenerative changes and focal periportal in- flammation in the hepatic cells of the hfsd group fig.

therefore any abnormality or disruption in the microbiota dysbiosis may have deleteri- ous consequences on the general health of the host .the digestive tract harbors a microbiota that plays vital roles in the onset and progress of health and dis- ease the internal environment of microbiota is not inert and can be influenced by dietary components specially fat.

group 1 n  20 con- tinued on the hfsd positive control group and group 2 received concomitant supplementation of probiotics at doses of 1 g per 1 kg of hfsd treatment group.blood and tissue samplingblood samples were collected from the medial canthus of the eye using a microhematocrit capillary tube dur- ing the fasting period.

resistin level decreases within the probiotic-administered group may have played an important role in reversing the accumula- tion of hepatic fat however the molecular and biochemical basis of the relationship between probiotics and resistin levels has yet to be defined.probiotics facilitate the restoration of normal hormo- nal activity in adipose tissues.ast and alt activity levels are the best clinical bio- markers of hepatic functions and illnesses rats fed the hfsd showed alterations in alt activity levels whencompared with rats fed the normal diet table this was apparently a consequence of increased lipogenesis increased accumulation of lipids in the hepatic cells and increased focal periportal inflammation fig.
