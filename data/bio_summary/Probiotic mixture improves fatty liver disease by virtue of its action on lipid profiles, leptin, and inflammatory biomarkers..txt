e. These bacteria shifted the overall structure of the gut microbiota that had been dis- turbed by the HFD towards that of lean mice fed a normal diet This is consistent with the finding that overall microbes may directly influence fatty acid uptake and satiety responses either through regu- lation of enteroendocrine cell numbers or through direct regulation of gut peptide hormone production and secretion Our data revealed that TNF-a and IL-6 levels in the serum of the HFSD group were sig- nificantly increased compared to those of the group fed the normal diet Table However when given the probiotic mixture the levels of these cytokines in the HFSD group returned to normal.Intestinal microorganisms affect cellular metabolism in different hepatic and adipose tissues outside the gut in this way they can control the glucose and lipid homeostasis and the general inflammatory status of their host Ingestion of a high-fat diet produces modifications within the intestinal microbiota and in- creases gut-derived inflammatory agents by renewing bowel flora in conditions of high fat diet-induced steato- sis.

Resistin level decreases within the probiotic-administered group may have played an important role in reversing the accumula- tion of hepatic fat however the molecular and biochemical basis of the relationship between probiotics and resistin levels has yet to be defined.Probiotics facilitate the restoration of normal hormo- nal activity in adipose tissues.AST and ALT activity levels are the best clinical bio- markers of hepatic functions and illnesses Rats fed the HFSD showed alterations in ALT activity levels whencompared with rats fed the normal diet Table this was apparently a consequence of increased lipogenesis increased accumulation of lipids in the hepatic cells and increased focal periportal inflammation Fig.

For example does the gut probiotics play a role in NAFLD pathogenesis What is the mechanism by which the gut probiotics helps the host animal to maintain homeostasis The effects of probiotic ingestion on NAFLD and other metabolic disorders have not yet been demonstrated and further research is needed to determine optimal probiotic strains algorithms of administration and subsequent ef- fects on organ functions.

Figure illustrates the return of normal structure in the hepatic cells of the probiotic-receiving group.Concerning NAFLD score normal group had 0 score for 90 of the cases and HFSD group revealed an in- creases in the number of cases in the score 1 followed by 2 mild to moderate steatosis while probiotics group presented increases in the number of cases in score 0 and 1 that indicate improve in the steatosis score Table DiscussionA mixture of probiotic strains was expected to have a greater benefit on the health of the host than a single- strain probiotic due to their presumed synergistic effectsTable 1 Effects of normal diet and HFSD on body weight in ratsNormalHFSDHFSD  ProbioticInitial body weight g109.4 - 4.52101.6 - 2.22101.6 - 2.22 Final Body weight gain227.9 - 15.36a268.7 - 8.450b238.7 - 9.43a Mean body weight gain60.03 - 4.05a71.78 - 2.90b64.

The group given the probiotic mixture displayed improved levels of these hepatic markers when compared to theHFSD-only group Table Furthermore the HFSD-fed group showed significant increases in serum leptin and resistin hormone levels compared to the group fed the normal diet Table administering the probiotic mix- ture appeared to regulate these hormonal imbalances.

Additionally enzymatic transaminases from cells are liber- ated into the blood due to the damaging effects of the presence of fat droplets and also due to the elevated amount of ROS generated from lipid peroxidation.Our results were consistent with previous studies that had indicated that R. verniciflua administration significantly reduces ALT activity levels in carbon tetrachloride-treated livers and may be effective in reducing liver inflammation Similarly chronic alcohol consumption may produce gut dysbiosis and may enhance the permeability of the in- testines to endotoxins such as alcohol-generated acetalde- hyde which can interrupt constricted junctions.

Based on previous work we suggest that there is poor communication between LAB probiotics and immune cells we also speculate that pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators are regulated by probiotics and have potential roles in the immune response  Bacterial surface proteins metabolites and secreted pro- teins can stimulate cytokine secretion and can activate NF-kB in cells in vitro However the effects of these bacterial products on host cytokine secretion and its blood level require in vivo support and exploration to be better understood our study employs a mixture of bac- teria at various concentrations and laboratory rats as the experimental in vivo components to address this.Our aim is to induce NAFLD disease in rats using a HFSD to produce an animal model of human steatosis in which we may monitor liver function biochemical markers lipid profiles adiposity and inflammation hor- mone levels.

Moreover NAFLD in the HFSD-fed group resulted in significant increases in IL-6 and TNF-a levels compared to the groups fed the normal diet while the group that was given the probiotic mixture appeared to recover from these changes.A photograph showing high fat deposition around the gut and an enlarged liver is presented in Fig.
