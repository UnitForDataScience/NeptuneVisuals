The outsized role of domestic animals as microbial habitats also has implications for atmospheric methane a significant proportion of which is gener- ated by animal gut methanogens.In part two of the same study  the authors looked for but failed to find scal- ing between gut microbial diversity using existing online DNA sequence data and animal mass.

For example applying these new principles to paleobiology we can estimate the gut of a 35-tonne Apatosaurus formerly Brontosaurus to have hosted nearly 100 quadrillion 1017 microbial cells based on Kieft and Simmons  and to have had a microbial diversity Simpson's reciprocal diversity 1D 1000 based on Godon et al.

who extracted DNA from 71 vertebrate species characterized their gut microbial diversity using small subunit rRNA gene analyses and calculated Simpson's diversity indices.

in that microbial abundance-to-M scaling is nearly linear A and the scaling exponents for diversity versus M B and diversity species richness versus N C are nearly identical.Concluding RemarksThese three recent examples of thinking big about the smallest organisms under- score the power of allometry to estimate biological parameters that defy direct measurement.

The dis- covery that allometric scaling applies to the microbial world has been inspired by the surge in new information relatinghuman and animal health to the mix ofhypotheses are pitted against each other.

2 1871 John Murray.New Allometric Scaling Laws Revealed for MicroorganismsThomas L. Kieft1Allometric scaling relationships based on microbial data sets are revealing novel biological princi- ples for example the abundance and diversity of animal-associated microbes scale with individual animal mass.

A The allometric scaling relationship between abundance of microbes associated with an individual animal and the mass M of each animal plotted on a log-log scale F7TDDIF.

Their analy- ses showed a robust scaling relationship between microbial diversity and animal masses ranging from a 12-g finch to a 3500-kg Asian elephant with an expo- nent of 0.34 B.

The scaling exponent was 1.07 consistent with the scaling of gut size to M. The relationship is a tight one r2  0.94.

The diversity of major groups varied as follows herbivores  omnivores  carnivores.
