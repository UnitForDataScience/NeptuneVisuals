The findings of the study summarized that these com- monly used classes of antibiotics target either 39S large mitochondrial ribosome or 28S small mitochondrial ri- bosome or mitochondrial OXPHOS 81 hence compro- mising the crucial mitochondrial functions.Antibiotic use is often associated with several side ef- fects in humans especially during pregnancy particular- ly targeting the ribosomal RNA and impairing the mito- chondrial physiology which subsequently leads to inter- ference in protein synthesis.

Thus caloric intake and ROS generation are in- volved in causing mitochondrial dysfunction.Increased mitochondrial biogenesis and activity dur- ing adipocyte differentiation 33 as well as the role of mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in faulty fatty acid oxidation in mature adipocytes 34 confirm the impor- tance of mitochondria in lipid metabolism subsequently linking it to diet-induced obesity 35.

Ma- ternal obesity detrimentally changes mitochondrial tar- gets which in turn contribute to mitochondrial dysfunc- tion and increased risk of obesity 24.

Potential modifi- cations in mitochondrial bioenergetics may arise due to specific mutations that occur in the mitochondrial DNA.

Mitofusin 2 MFN2 is another vital protein that is required for a range of mitochondrial functions includ- ing maintenance of mitochondrial integrity fusion me- tabolism and tethering with the endoplasmic reticulum.

Although altered gut microbiota is linked to obesity and mitochondrial dysfunction is ob- served in conditions of obesity currently there is no di- rect evidence for ascribing the role of mitochondrial DNA polymorphic forms in obesity.AntibioticsAlthough the discovery of antibiotics is considered as one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century the in- creasing magnitude of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of resistance have become a menace to the public health system 47.

Figure illustrating the influence of antibiotics on the generation and transmission of antibiotic resistance on cytokines leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity and on MMPs affecting mitochondrial function as well as involvement in several diseases.Klebsiella pneumoniae to third-generation cephalospo- rins and carbapenems Staphylococcus aureus to methicil- lin and Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin 71.

Reports also suggest that in- creased free fatty acids in the inner mitochondrial mem- brane promote uncoupling of oxidation and phosphory- lation leading to mitochondrial function impairment 160 161.

This may either lead to the production of a a functionally normal protein or b a truncated protein which results in impairment of mitochondrial activity.In summary antibiotics seem to have multifaceted roles wherein they cause mitochondrial dysfunction in- fluence obesity and are involved in the modulation of NMD pathway regulation of the activity of MMPs andcytokines and they confer antibiotic resistance.
