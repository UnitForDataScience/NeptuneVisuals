It is not clear whether DAMPs or PAMPs initiate the pro-inflammatory process during uterine involution but either of these signals may induce the cytokine release from epithelial cells and other immune cells that attracts neutrophils a.During the first wk postpartum there is marked neutrophil recruitment 68 of total cells obtained on endometrial cytology following normal parturition and this neutrophil recruitment is closely associated with increased cytokine secretion seen in clini- cally normal cows until 24 days in milk .

This may however be just one of many mechanisms by which endometrial epithelial cells respond to DAMPs since a pro-inflammatory response can also be induced by sterile cellular necrosis.Genital tract epithelial cells may also act as immune effector cells when challenged by bacteria.

In mice potential pro- genitor cells of epithelial and stromal origin contribute to epithelial regeneration and thus maintain epithelial integrity during the postpartum period.

Identifying the role of individual PRRs in recog- nizing DAMPs or PAMPs relevant to the bovine female genital tract is crucial as endometrial cells need to respond to environmental contaminants including both pathogens and cellular debris during the period of uterine involution a.Based on transcriptomic analysis of gene expression a temporalshift from up-regulated pro-inflammatory responses at the third wk postpartum to an increased expression of genes involved in epithelial regeneration and repair 30 d postpartum was observed .

However the complement regulatory proteins including CD46 membrane cofactor protein CD55 decay accelerator factor and CD59 membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis which are proposed to protect normal human endometrial epithelial cells and sperm against the complement complex  have yet to be studied in the bovine genital tract during the postpartum period.During the postpartum period the inflamed uterus responds by increasing secretion of different anti-microbial peptides AMP at different time points.

Macrophages endometrial epithelial cells and dendritic cells interact with T- cells to elicit cellular responses and regulate antibody responses.

Resolution of uterine inflammatory processes b may involve both epithelial cells as well as a variety of immune cells including anti-inflammatory macrophages M2 regulatory T-cells Treg natural killer NK cells and possibly commensal bacteria.

Around the second wk postpartum e the simple columnar uterine epithelial barrier is breached at the caruncles due to death of epithelial cells.

Specialized epithelial cells in the genital tract also contribute to genital tract defense mechanisms by secreting mucus that facilitates physical clearance of microbial contaminants .Bovine genital tract epithelial cells similar to immune cellshave the capacity to recognize pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules PAMPs as well as damage-associated molecular patterns DAMPs through a variety of pattern recognition re- ceptors PRRs a.

This would enhance our understanding of the role cytokines and AMP play in regulating uterine inflammation.Endometrial epithelial cells may function not only as immunesensors and effectors but may also act as regulators of immune cell function through the secretion of cytokines a. Cytokines such as IL8 are potent neutrophil chemoattractants and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor GM-CSF secreted by epithelial cells is required for macrophage maturation .
