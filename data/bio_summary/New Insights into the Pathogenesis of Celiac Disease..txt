Moreover it is demon- strated that IFN-g is the most potent inducer of TG2 and thatits synergism with TNF-a contributed to exacerbate CD .However a high TG2 expression is not unique to CD and anti-TGantibodies are often observed in other inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative disease and juvenile diabetes.Tissue transglutaminase 2 is particularly notable for being the autoantigen that may contribute to intensify the inflamma- tory process in CD patients by destruction of villous extracel- lular matrix and as a target for intestinal villous epithelial cell destruction .

Autoantibody reactivity to TG2 is a specific and sensitive marker highly useful in aiding diagnosis and follow-up of CD but the mechanism by which TG2 becomes the main autoantigen in CD is not yet understood  and we will discuss this point subsequently.Finally since recent evidence based on global epidemiological and scientific studies has suggested that the risk of some con- ditions such as obesity inflammatory bowel disease cancer and also some autoimmune diseases may be influenced by the microbioma  we will discuss the role of microbiome in CD pathogenesis.GLUTeN-SPeCiFiC CD4 T-CeLLS HiGH PRODUCeR OF iFNg AND LOw PRODUCeR OF BACH2It is widely accepted that fragments of gliadin one of the main component of gluten present in food pass through the epithelial barrier of the small intestine and enter the lamina propria wherethey are deaminated by tissue TG2 and then linked to specific HLA-class II DQ2 or DQ8 molecules.

Although the mechanisms of interaction among overall these components are not yet fully understood recent proteomics and molecular studies had shed some lights in the pathogenic role of tissue transglutaminase 2 in CD and in the alteration of the intestinal barrier function induced by host microbiota.Keywords celiac disease B-cell immunoglobulin transglutaminase microbiomaiNTRODUCTiONCeliac disease CD is characterized by small intestinal mucosal injury and nutrient malabsorption .

Intracellular TG2 is enzymatically inactive and for reasons that are not understood TG2 is transportedextracellularly where it become enzymatically active.

TG2 expression is regulated by several post-translational mechanisms but the mechanism of its regulation is not completely understood.It is fully demonstrated that TG2 is upregulated in the mucosa of the small intestine during active CD.

The TG2gliadin complexes might provide the generationof the TG2 autoantibodies but the exact mechanism by which TG2 becomes the main autoantigen in CD has not been settled.

In this section we aim to summarizing the last hypothesis for the generation of TG2 autoantibodies in CD.To understand the Ig-TG2 interaction it is first necessary to understand how the conformational status of TG2 influences its catalyticactivity.TG2isreferredtobeabifunctionalenzymeowing to its ability to catalyze a Ca2-dependent protein cross-linking activity and a Ca2-independent GTP hydrolysis  .

By using the X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering approaches the detailed structural interaction between self-antibody and TG2 protein has been evidenced and then confirmed by using the generation of single aminoacid mutations in the TG2 epitope followed by the measure of the protein-protein interaction .
