We also saw a positive correlation between ASCA and uric acid in the serum of human patients thus iden- tifying a novel mechanism by which gut fungi contribute to disease development.

Administration of allopurinol a drug that blocks uric acid production was sufficient to reduce the severity of disease.

''What's nextWe are exploring whether we can detect disease-relevant molecular interactions in mammalian cells and also reworking the evolu- tion system to evolve protein-protein interac- tions.

This is based on our unexpected result that the split RNAP and fusion protein co- evolved during the biological evolutions.

Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae anti- bodies ASCA remain the most specific serolog- ical marker differentiating Crohn's disease CD and ulcerative colitis UC two inflammatory gut disorders suggesting that intestinal fungi may play a role during these diseases.

To test whether these organisms have a role to play during disease we introduced two repre- sentative members of human gut microbiotaS.

aaf9044 and observe that S. cerevisiae wors- ened the course of disease.Transcriptomics and metabolomics of germ- free mice mono-associated with S. cerevisiae revealed an effect on epithelial integrity and induction of uric acid.

Accumulation of uric acid during S. cerevisiae colonization led to greater gut permeability and worsened dis- ease.

ND pathologies also frequently include mitochondrialdefects.
