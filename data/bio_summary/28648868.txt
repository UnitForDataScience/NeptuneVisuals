Pre-incubation with lactobacilli increased LPS-induced expression of the maturation markers CD80 and CD86 whereas pre-incubation with bifidobacteria decreased such expression.

The reaction conditions for 39 cycles were 95 degC for 30 s 54.6 degC L-32 60 degC IL-12 TNF-a or 66.0 degC IL-10 for 30 s and 72 degC for 40 s. The relative gene expression levels of TNF-a IL-12p40 and IL-10 were calculated using the DDCT method and presented as fold change in gene expression after normalization to the L-32 housekeeping gene.

Nevertheless it was statistically confirmed that pre-treatment with lactobacilli mainly in- creased the LPS-induced expression of maturation markers whereas pre-incubation with bifidobacteria decreased such expression.

On the other hand pre-incubation with both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolates significantly up-regulated IL-10 expression once again independently of diet c and d. Yet expression of the pleiotropic cytokine TNF-a was not significantly modulated by pre-in- cubation with lactobacilli a or bifidobacteria b.

Analysis of the cytokine profile indicated that strains of both genera induced down-regulation of IL-12 and up-regulation of IL-10 whereas expression of TNF-a was not modulated.

Data were collected from ungated cells and are representative of three independent experiments.. DCs were mainly CD11b-CD11c data not shown with low expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86  iDCs.

Incubation with the TLR4 ligand LPS for 6 h resulted in increased expression of CD80 and CD86 surface maturation markers although toFig.

On the contrary pre-treatment with all three bifidobacteria isolates caused a reduction in LPS-inducible expression of CD80 and CD86  subjects n. 14 21 and 39.

Setup of cytokine expression by DCs.

a Kinetic analysis of IL-12 IL-10 and TNF-a transcription in iDCs in response to LPS pulse values were calculated as fold change in gene expression and expressed as  of maximum induction.
