however in the nonmets-nonob and nonmets-ob groups no significant microbiota changes were observed after the dietary intervention.the obese microbiota pattern described in animal models is characterized by a higher firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio.4 how- ever studies in obese humans do not always correspond with what is expected in animal studies.7-10 as previously com- mented these different results might be explained by differences in the features of the different cohorts.1132 to avoid some of these confusion factors we selected age-matched groups with only male participants and our data suggested that metaboliccharacterized by a reduction in the abundance of genera with saccharolytic activity which leads to a reduction in carbohydrate degradation capacity in mets patients as compared with lean control individuals.

in the present study we have found in the subgroup of patients with mets-ob a similar reduction of the genera with saccharolytic activity especially bacteroides and pre- votella both forming the bacteroidetes phylum and roseburia ru- minococcus and faecalibacterium.34-36 our data suggest that the loss of certain functions or features of the gut microbiota such as the loss of the capacity to degrade carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acid scfa may be related with the metabolic dysfunc- tion of the host organism.3738 taking into account that amino acids can also serve as precursors for the synthesis of scfa by bacteria39 the loss of the capacity to degrade carbohydrates to scfa may imbalance the interplay between gut microbiota and amino acid and scfa homeostasis shifting the bacterial activ- ity toward scfa production from amino acids.
