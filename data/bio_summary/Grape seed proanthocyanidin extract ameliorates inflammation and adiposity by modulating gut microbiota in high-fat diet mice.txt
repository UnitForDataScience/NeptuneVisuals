More importantly depleting gut microbiota by antibiotics treatment abolished the beneficial effects of GSPE on inflammation and adiposity.Conclusion Our study identifies the novel links between gut microbiota alterations and metabolic benefits by GSPE supplementation providing possibilities for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders by targeting gut microbiota through a potential prebiotic agent GSPE.KeywordsAdiposity  GSPE  Gut microbiota  High-fat diet  InflammationAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived December 15 2016Revised April 16 2017Accepted April 18 20171IntroductionCorrespondence Jie Hong and Ruixin LiuE-mails hongjiemedmail.com.cn Abbreviations Abx antibiotics mix eWAT epidydimal white adi- pose tissue GSPE grape seed proanthocyanidin extract HFD high-fat diet IL-6 interleukin 6 IPGTT intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test ITT insulin tolerance test iWAT inguinal white adipose tissue MCP-1 monocyte chemotactic protein 1 NCDObesity and overweight have become one of the most important public health problems worldwide 1 2.

In Anhe et al report mice were fed high fathigh sucrose HFHS for 8 weeks and in Roopchand et al report the grape polyphenols were sorbed to soy pro- tein isolate and the experiment lasted for 13 weeks.

These find- ings reveal that gut microbiota may contribute to metabolic tissue inflammation thereby affecting host metabolism.Prebiotics which function as a regulator of gut microbiotathat can maintain gut microbiota homeostasis have been concentrated by researchers.

Taken to- gether these results demonstrate that GSPE supplemen-tation modulated the gut microbiota composition in HFD fed mice.Effect of GSPE on metabolic improvement partially depends on gut microbiotaTo further investigate whether the changes in the gut mi- crobiota induced by GSPE supplementation contribute to the metabolic improvement in GSPE-treated mice we next de- pleted the gut microbiota using broad-spectrum antibiotics ampicillin and neomycin 3 days before and during the whole experiment in the other two groups HFDPBSAbx and HFDGSPEAbx.

Backhed et al reported that in contrast to specific-pathogen free mice germ-free mice were protected against obesity when consum- ing a high-fat diet 10.

Roopchand et al reported that this grape extract mixture sup- plementation could improve metabolic profiles companied with the increased A. muciniphila 20.

In Caesar et al re- port mice fed with fish oil ameliorated the white adipose tissue inflammation which was concomitant with the in- creased abundance of Proteobacteria 44.

Taken together these results revealed microbial changes upon GSPE supplementation that may associate with its metabolic benefit.Of note a recent study by Masumoto et al has reported that the polymeric procyanidins derived from apple extract pre- vented high-fathigh-sucrose HFHS-induced obesity asso- ciated with the decreased FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio and the increased proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila in ce- cum which was not detected in the oligomeric procyanidins- treated mice 65.

Additionally we detected an increased abundance of Clostridium Lach- nospiraceae in GSPE supplemented HFD mice which how- ever was reduced in the Masumoto et al's report.
