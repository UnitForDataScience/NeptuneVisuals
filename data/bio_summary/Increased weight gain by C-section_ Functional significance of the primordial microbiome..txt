birth mode-discriminatory underrepresented taxa in c-section mice at weaning included bacteroides ruminococcaceae lachnospiraceae and clostridiales and overrepresented taxa included s24.7 lactobacillus and erysipelotrichaceae fig.

another differ- ence with human c-sections is that our mouse c-section involves fostering because survival c-section attempts were not successful.

overall mice gained 33 more weight at age 15 weeks if they were born by c-section but females showed a stronger phenotypic effect with 70 higher weight gain fig.

mice that were delivered by c-section also showed a marginal increase in the pro- portion of body fat at 15 weeks of age as determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry dexa fig.

these results are consistent with the epidemiological association between c-section and increased risk of obesity 4 13-16.c-section causes abnormal development of the fecal microbiotaby examining the early gut microbiota during the 4 weeks following weaning we observed a significant segregation by delivery mode anal-ysis of similarities anosim p  0.001 fig.

however c-section mice showed no major changes in microbiome maturity or structure fig.

diversity in controls was higher at weaning and drops between week 3 and week 5 but increases by week 6 whereas no major age changes were observed in c-section-born mice before week 5. signif- icance was determined pairwise by anova test with resampling 999 times blue brackets compare vaginally born communities red brackets compare c-section com- munities and black brackets compare birth modes.

on the basis of microbial com- munity composition a random forest model was built with fecal samples from vaginally delivered mice as the training set to predict the maturity indices of mice born via c-section using the randomforest package in r as previously reported 24.supplementary materialssupplementary material for this article is available at fig.

in general the proportions of dominant taxa discriminant for birth mode decreased throughout the first 3 weeks after weaning fig.

mice in the c-section group gained more body mass after weaning with a stronger phenotype in females.

the results demonstrate a causal relationship between c-section and increased body weight supporting the involvement of maternal vaginal bacteria in normal metabolic development.rights reserved exclusive licensee american association for the advancement of science.
