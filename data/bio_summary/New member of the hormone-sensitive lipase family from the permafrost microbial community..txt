Alignment of amino acid sequences of Lip1Pc from Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5T PMGL2 and PMGL3 from the permafrost metagenomic library.

Multiple alignment of Lip1Pc PMGL2 and PMGL3 revealed only low level of sequence homology between them 22-28 while the positions of 3 putative catalytic residues are well con- served .

In PMGL3 2 adjacent carboxylic resi- dues Asp242 and Glu243 could be aligned with putative catalytic aspartates of Lip1Pc and PMGL2.

In Lip1Pc it contains a typical aspartate residue GDSAG while in PMGL3 this aspartate is substituted for a glutamate GESAG.

On the con- trary PMGL2 and PMGL3 contain less lysines more prolines and arginines than Lip1Pc.

At the same time the content of glycine residues is higher in these pro- teins 9.2-9.3 in comparison with 5.6 in Lip1Pc.
