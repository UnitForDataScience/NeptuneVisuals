a gingival cross-sections from adult swiss webster spf mice germ- free mice gf and gf mice cocaged with spf mice for 2 mo stained with antibodies against pros1 red gas6 green axl green and hoechst blue.

2 a and b. col- onization of gf mice with bacteria following cocaging with spf mice for 2 mo restored gas6 expression though not to similar levels as in spf mice.

8 a-c. however whereas reconstitution of wt mice with bm of gas6-- mice g-w had no impact on the load and diversity of oral micro-biota administration of wt bm cells into gas6-- mice w-g resulted in a significant alteration of the oral microbiota.

s6 e-g. whereas the lack of alveolar bone loss in aged gas6-- mice does not reflect the immunological and microbial status of their gingiva it is in agreement with previous studies reporting that gas6 is crucial for the resorption function of mature osteoclasts 22 23. there- fore although gas6-- mice should have an increased periodontal bone loss based on their periodontal immunological and microbial dysbiosis the lack of gas6 that prevents osteoclast function ulti-mately protects these mice from alveolar bone loss.discussionin this study we first demonstrated that gas6 plays a funda- mental role in maintaining oral mucosal homeostasis.

in contrast to spf mice gas6 was not expressed in the gingiva of gf mice fig.

we next assessed expression of pros1 in gf mice and found that pros1 was not significantly altered by bacterial colonization in these mice.

nevertheless compared with gas6 mice gas6-- mice have elevated numbers of neutrophils cd45cd11bly6g cells fig.

we then quantified mrna levels of il-10 and tnf-a in the gingiva and concurring with our results il-10 was highly expressed in gas6 mice whereas tnf-a was pre- dominantly expressed in gas6-- mice fig.

3d the gingiva of gas6-- mice contained significantly higher percentages of il- 17a-producing cd4 t cells than gas6 mice.

data indicate the relative ex- pression levels of the noted gene among spf gf and cocaged mice and represent the mean of five mice - sem.

bar graph illustrates levels of gas6 expression in b6 and myd88-- mice and represent the mean of three mice - sem.

furthermore the amount of foxp3 expressed per cell was significantly reduced in gas6-- mice in comparison with gas6 mice fig.

such a reduction in cellular foxp3 levels was shown previously to severely impair treg capability to regulate immunity 17. in contrast to tregs th17 cells identified by ics on pmaionomycin-stimulated ln cells were significantly higher in gas6-- mice compared with gas6 mice fig.

5a the oral cavity of gas6-- mice sheltered an overall elevated bacterial load about twofold higher compared with gas6 mice.

a considerable elevation of about 1.2 logs in the load of cultivated anaerobic bacteria was found in gas6-- mice in comparison with gas6 mice fig.
