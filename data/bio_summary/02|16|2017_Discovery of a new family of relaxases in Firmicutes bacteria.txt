We also provided evidence that the nicking activity resides in the N-terminal domain of RelLS20 and that tyrosine 26 constitutes the catalytic resi- due responsible for making a transient 5' phosphotyrosine bond with the nucleotide at the nick site.RelLS20 is the prototype of a novel relaxase family MOBL that contains a large number of relaxases which are almost exclusively encoded in bacteria belonging to the phylum FirmicutesBy performing psiblast searches 7 iterations we identified 817 sequences in public databases that may encode proteins showing significant homology with RelLS20 cutoff 1e-15 and we classified these relaxases into a new family named MOBL.

RelLS20 did not relax the plas- mid however when the reaction mixture contained the chelating agent EDTA  sup- porting the view that RelLS20 requires divalent cations like Mg for the nicking reaction as has been observed for other relaxases containing a Histidine triad  for review see .Relaxases are often multidomain proteins.

The position of the catalytic Tyrosine residue of MOBP type relaxases is indicated with a vertical arrow.Samples of pGR16B with RelLS20 or without control prior incubation with RelLS20 were used as template DNA in sequencing reactions using forward primer 28 or reverse primer 29.

Most probably many or all of these proteins are relaxases and hence RelLS20 constitutes the prototype of a new family of relaxases that we name MOBL.

An align- ment of these two signatures suggests that the catalytic Tyr residue of MOBP type relaxases corresponds to RelLS20 residue Tyr26 and it shows that this tyrosine residue is almost fully con- served in the RelLS20-related putative relaxases see .

Secondly these observations provide evidence that RelLS20 is the prototype of a large newA 17 residue region of the deduced protein sequence of pLS20cat gene 58 shows similarity to the motif III regions of MOBP MOBQ and MOBV type relaxases.

These results showed that pLS20cat gene 58 was required for conjugation as would be expected for a relaxase gene.The origin of transfer region of pLS20cat oriTLS20 is located upstream of gene 56 and is intrinsically bentThe results presented above show that RelLS20 can function in trans.

Residues of the deduced pLS20cat p58 sequence are highlighted against a light grey dark grey and black background when they are conserved with respect to the consensus sequence present in one two or three of the MOB families respectively.doi10.1371journal.pgen.1006586.g001family of relaxases which we name MOBL and which contains over 800 members that are almost exclusively encoded by Firmicutes bacteria.We next performed additional analyses to gain insights into the evolutionary relationship between the newly identified MOBL family of relaxases and the previously described relaxase families.

The phylogenetic tree obtained shows that the MOBL members can be divided into two clades and that RelLS20 belongs to clade 1.Bioinformatic analyses were performed to study whether besides RelLS20 other MOBL members are encoded by a plasmid.

In summary the outcome of three complemen- tary experimental approaches showed that RelLS20 is monomeric in solution.Biochemical analyses of RelLS20 and determination of the nic siteRelaxases introduce a site- and strand-specific cut at the so-called nic site within the oriT region and remains covalently attached to the 5' end via a tyrosine residue.
