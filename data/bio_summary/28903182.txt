Conversely while comparing the Shannon Weaver index H1 it was found to be higher in HT group in contrast to control group that denoted the bacterial overgrowth in the diseased group.

The bacterial DNA samples within each group or individual samples were divided into two clusters based on weighted UniFrac metrics depicted in corresponding to samples of HT and normal control group analogous to the pattern of PCR-DGGE.Gut microbiota population at phyla levelThe gut microbial taxa composed of more than 1-0.5 were focused and composition was assessed on the taxonomic basis at phylum family genus and species level.Gut microbial organization at family levelAt the family level 83 different families were sequenced among 10 top most families the prevalence of Bacteroidaceae Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenaceae were higher in the diseased group as compared to control shown in .

Taxon tag was Ave. 72810.35 in all samples of both HT and control group and the total unique tag count detected in diseased and control group was 12241 and 10457 respectively with Ave. 1134.9 in all samples.

In10 top most genera there was raised an abundance of Bacteroides Escherichia-Shigella and Parasutterella genera in the diseased group in contrast to control group shown in .

H or C represent Hashimoto and control group respectively.dissimilarity at species level between HT and control group.

The statistical ana- lysis of a -diversity nonparametric Chao1 algorithm ACE and ob- served species was significantly elevated in the diseased group as compared to healthy control while good's coverage was significantly higher in control group.

less in inter- group as compared to intra-group that by previous research findings  demonstrating the dissimilarity of gut microbial com- position in HT patients as compared to control group.

H or C represent Hashimoto and control group respectively.Actinobacteria showed a raised level in the diseased group as compared to control which is consistent with previous work of physiological stress and gut microbiota .

We observed the declined abundance of Prevotella9 and Dialister while elevated genera of the diseased group included Escherichia-Shigella and Parasutterella.

H or C represent Hashimoto and control group respectively.profiles were computed by using the UPGMA method based on the Dice similarity coefficient band-based.
