Perturbations in the gut microbiome have been implicated to cause metabolic syndrome5 and the role of the gut microbiome in pregnancy has become the subject of considerable interest6.Although a change in the exposure to maternal microbial diversity in fetuses remains one of the leading explanations for epigenetic changes and an increase in the risk of non-commu- nicable diseases7 the association between the maternal gut microbiome and fetal epigenetic changes of diabetes-associated genes has not been elucidated.Received 29 June 2016 revised 13 November 2016 accepted 15 November 2016The umbilical cord is fetal tissue and it can be obtained from infants non-invasively.

The pre- sent study provides possibilities for the interactions between the maternal gut microbiome and the epigenetic changes of diabetes-associated genes in fetal tissue.The results of the present study are limited by the small sample size.

In the present study we investigated associations between changes in the maternal gut microbiome and differentially methylated regions of diabetes-associated genes in umbilical cord samples.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsWe recruited 10 pregnant women who were participants in the Chiba Study of Mother and Children's Health which included collection of stool blood and umbilical cord samples assess- ment of dietary records and administration of questionnaires9.

The present study investigated the associations between maternal gut micro- biome and differentially methylated regions of diabetes-associated genes in umbilical cord samples.

The present study found that changes in the UBE2E2 and KCNQ1 methylation rates in umbilical cord samples were associated with the proportion of Firmicutes in the maternal gut albeit with marginal correlations after adjustment for age and body mass index.

Similarly the association of KCNQ1 with type 2 diabetes was shown in non-European populations17.Figure 2  Correlation between maternal gut microbiome and deoxyribonucleic acid methylation of diabetes-associated genes in the umbilical cord.

These findings suggest a link between the methylation of diabetes-associated genes in fetuses and maternal microbiota components during pregnancy.INTRODUCTIONEpigenetic alternations of diabetes-associated genes have been reported to increase the risk of diabetes12.

Although low birth- weight and maternal malnutrition which are considered as fetal environmental factors can cause epigenetic alternations of dia- betes-associated genes3 few studies have investigated the epige- netic alternations in type 2 diabetes-associated genes of fetal tissues.The gut microbiome has been shown to be a novel environ- mental factor that directly affects metabolism4.
