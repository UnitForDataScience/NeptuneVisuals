Both Fusobacterium spp and Sutterella spp were associated consistently with no remission in patients who had double-blind and open-label faecal microbiota trans- plantation appendix pp 79-85 for Fusobacterium spp this association entailed either lack of eradication in patients who did not achieve remission increased abundance in patients without remission or eradication in patients who achieved remission appendix p 86.DiscussionOur study findings suggest that intensive-dosing faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with active ulcerative colitis as defined by a rigorous composite primary endpoint of corticosteroid- free clinical remission and endoscopic remission or response.

Five patients who were not in clinical remission at completion of either masked or open-label faecal microbiota transplantation had continued improvement after cessation of treatment and were in clinical remission at final follow-up without any additional treatment.20 patients needed an escalation in treatment for ulcerative colitis before follow-up at 8 weeks after either masked or open-label faecal microbiota transplantation.Nine 22 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and 11 28 of 40 allocated placebo p056 discontinued treatment or had protocol failure before week 8 figure 1.

Increased a diversity was specific to faecal microbiota transplantation three patients allocated placebo who met criteria for the primary outcome showed no change in diversity appendix p 78.To identify taxa associated with the primary outcome in patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation linear discriminant analysis effect size analyses were done in masked and open-label patients appendix pp 79-85.

Additional studies are necessary to further define the underlying microbiological mechanisms and predictors of response and to optimise and personalise microbial-based treatments in ulcerative colitis.study showing a possible difference in outcome related to individual donors.5In the Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Chronic Active Ulcerative Colitis FOCUS study we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of multidonor intensive- dosing faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with active ulcerative colitis.MethodsStudy design and participantsWe conducted a randomised double-blind placebo- controlled trial of multidonor intensive-dosing faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with active ulcerative colitis appendix p 10.

We planned 40 patients per group for recruitment to ensure a greater than 80 probability of showing a difference between treatment groups with a two-sided a of 005 on modified intention-to-treat analysis.The modified intention-to-treat analysis included all patients who received at least one study dose.

By per-protocol analysis 11 34 of 32 patients treated with faecal microbiota transplantation and three 10 of 29 patients receiving placebo achieved the primary outcome 33 10-107 p0026.

On logistic regression analysis the primary endpoint remained significant while considering disease extent severity and concomitant medication use data not shown.At week 8 steroid-free clinical remission was reported in 18 44 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation compared with eight 20 of 40 allocated placebo RR 22 95 CI 11-45 p0021 steroid-free clinical response was achieved respectively by 22 54 of 41 and nine 23 of 40 patients 24 13-45 p0004 table 2 appendix p 11.

11 patients who began open-label faecal microbiota transplantation discontinued study treatment five because of symptom worsening on steroid reduction two for symptom persistence or progression in the absence of steroid reduction and four due to non-compliance.32 78 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and 33 83 of 40 allocated placebo had at least one adverse event during the 8-week period of masked treatment with no significant difference between study groups in number or type of adverse events table 3.

The most common adverse events were self-limiting gastrointestinal complaints.Six serious adverse events occurred during study treatment two in patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation one in a patient allocated placebo and three in patients who progressed to open-label faecal microbiota transplantation table 3.

One donor D054 seemed to be associated with benefit in a post-hoc analysis 14 37 of 38 patients treated with faecal microbiota transplantation that contained a sample from this donor blinded and open- label met criteria for the primary outcome compared with seven 18 of 40 patients whose faecal microbiota transplantation did not include a sample from this donor p0054.Figure 2 Case examples of primary outcome after faecal microbiota transplantationA B 37-year-old woman with a 4-year history of left-sided ulcerative colitis and acute colitis diarrhoea six times per day with bleeding despite maximum oral and topical 5-aminosalicylate treatment.
