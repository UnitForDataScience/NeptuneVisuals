on logistic regression analysis the primary endpoint remained significant while considering disease extent severity and concomitant medication use data not shown.at week 8 steroid-free clinical remission was reported in 18 44 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation compared with eight 20 of 40 allocated placebo rr 22 95 ci 11-45 p0021 steroid-free clinical response was achieved respectively by 22 54 of 41 and nine 23 of 40 patients 24 13-45 p0004 table 2 appendix p 11. steroid-free endoscopic response was noted in 13 32 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation compared with four 10 of 40 allocated placebo rr 32 95 ci 11-89 p0016 however endoscopic remission did not differ between study groups five 12 of 41 vs three 8 of 40 respectively rr 16 95 ci 04-64 p048 table 2 appendix p 12. endoscopic outcomes were similar with uceis scoring appendix p 13.week 4 clinical assessments showed that clinical response was significantly greater in patients allocated faecal microbiota transplantation than in those assigned placebo 17 41 of 41 vs five 13 of 40 rr 33 95 ci 14-81 p0003 but clinical remission did not differ significantly between study groups at this timepoint 12 29 of 41 vs five 13 of 40 respectively rr 23 95 ci 09-60 p0064 appendix p 14. at week 8 the total mayo score and decrease in total mayo score differed significantly between study groups however ibdq score and inflammatory markers did not differ significantly appendix p 8.37 patients assigned placebo proceeded to open-label faecal microbiota transplantation of whom ten 27 met criteria for the primary endpoint on completion of open-label treatment.

otus and phylogenetic diversity increased significantly relative to baseline in all patients treated with faecal microbiota transplantation at 4 weeks and 8 weeks and persisted at 8 weeks after treatment all p00001 figure 3a 3b appendix p 16. similar patterns were observed for species richness and shannon's diversity data not shown.in diversity analyses significant differences in microbial profiles and reduced dispersion levels were noted after faecal microbiota transplantation from otu to class taxonomic levels appendix pp 22-29. principal component analysis confirmed the changes in microbial profiles of patients undergoing faecal microbiota transplantation figure 3c appendix pp 17-21. patients' profiles shifted from a dominance of bacteroides spp to prevotella spp figure 3c appendix p 30. the shift in microbial profiles of patients undergoing faecal microbiota transplantation towards the donor was most notable at the otu level appendix p 31.using linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis patients' baseline samples were compared with samples taken at week 4 week 8 and 8 weeks after faecal microbiota transplantation to identify taxa altered by the treatment appendix pp 32-42 and with donor samples to identify otus associated with donor batches and those associated with the patient appendix pp 43-51. across all taxonomic levels 295 microbial taxa were differentially abundant after faecal microbiota transplantation of which 78 showed strong associations linear discriminant analysis score 3. a decrease in baseline patient-derived bacteroides spp eg otu 8 15 69 and an increase in donor-derived prevotella spp eg otu 2 and donor-derived bacteroides spp eg otu 12 26 56 was noted with both masked and open-label faecal microbiota transplantation independent of clinical outcome.

both fusobacterium spp and sutterella spp were associated consistently with no remission in patients who had double-blind and open-label faecal microbiota trans- plantation appendix pp 79-85 for fusobacterium spp this association entailed either lack of eradication in patients who did not achieve remission increased abundance in patients without remission or eradication in patients who achieved remission appendix p 86.discussionour study findings suggest that intensive-dosing faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with active ulcerative colitis as defined by a rigorous composite primary endpoint of corticosteroid- free clinical remission and endoscopic remission or response.

additional studies are necessary to further define the underlying microbiological mechanisms and predictors of response and to optimise and personalise microbial-based treatments in ulcerative colitis.study showing a possible difference in outcome related to individual donors.5in the fecal microbiota transplantation for chronic active ulcerative colitis focus study we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of multidonor intensive- dosing faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with active ulcerative colitis.methodsstudy design and participantswe conducted a randomised double-blind placebo- controlled trial of multidonor intensive-dosing faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with active ulcerative colitis appendix p 10. patients aged 18-75 years with ulcerative colitis for greater than3 months were enrolled at three australian hospital centres st vincent's hospital sydney bankstown- lidcombe hospital sydney and nambour general hospital nambour.we obtained written informed consent from all patients before screening.

11 patients who began open-label faecal microbiota transplantation discontinued study treatment five because of symptom worsening on steroid reduction two for symptom persistence or progression in the absence of steroid reduction and four due to non-compliance.32 78 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and 33 83 of 40 allocated placebo had at least one adverse event during the 8-week period of masked treatment with no significant difference between study groups in number or type of adverse events table 3. the most common adverse events were self-limiting gastrointestinal complaints.six serious adverse events occurred during study treatment two in patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation one in a patient allocated placebo and three in patients who progressed to open-label faecal microbiota transplantation table 3. one patient with refractory ulcerative colitis who was assigned faecal microbiota transplantation withdrew at week 2 because of clinical and endoscopic deterioration change in mayo endoscopic subscore from 2 to 3 and in uceis score from 5 to 7 and underwent colectomy.

11 27 of41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and three 8 of 40 allocated placebo achieved the primary outcome on modified intention-to-treat analysis rr 36 95 ci 11-119 p0021 figure 2a 2b appendix p 11. by per-protocol analysis 11 34 of 32 patients treated with faecal microbiota transplantation and three 10 of 29 patients receiving placebo achieved the primary outcome 33 10-107 p0026.

five patients who were not in clinical remission at completion of either masked or open-label faecal microbiota transplantation had continued improvement after cessation of treatment and were in clinical remission at final follow-up without any additional treatment.20 patients needed an escalation in treatment for ulcerative colitis before follow-up at 8 weeks after either masked or open-label faecal microbiota transplantation.nine 22 of 41 patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and 11 28 of 40 allocated placebo p056 discontinued treatment or had protocol failure before week 8 figure 1. reasons for study discontinuation included symptom worsening on steroid reduction three faecal microbiota transplantation vs six placebo symptom persistence or progression in the absence of steroid reduction five vs three and non-compliance one vs two.

increased a diversity was specific to faecal microbiota transplantation three patients allocated placebo who met criteria for the primary outcome showed no change in diversity appendix p 78.to identify taxa associated with the primary outcome in patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation linear discriminant analysis effect size analyses were done in masked and open-label patients appendix pp 79-85.

endoscopic remission did not differ between patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and placebo which was defined stringently as a steroid-free mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 but endoscopic response was achieved in three times as many individuals allocated faecal microbiota transplantation compared with those assigned placebo 32 13 of 41 vs 10  four of 40. data from patients assigned placebo who subsequently received open-label faecal microbiota transplantation provided further intra-patient support for the validity of the masked treatment findings 27 ten of 37 met criteria for the primary endpoint.because many patients were steroid-dependent the mandatory steroid wean was demanding and resulted in several individuals withdrawing from the study.

inclusion criteria for patients are detailed in the appendix p 2. patients had to have clinically and endoscopically active ulcerative colitis with a total mayo score7 of 4-10. the mayo endoscopy subscore had to be 1 or greater and physician's global assessment subscore 2 or less.

exclusion criteria for patients are detailed in the appendix pp 3 4. we excluded individuals with indeterminate colitis major comorbid chronic disease major food allergy irritable bowel syndrome or a history of bowel cancer those who were pregnant and patients who had previous gastrointestinal surgery apart from appendicectomy more than 3 months before the study.

secondary outcomes were steroid-free clinical remission defined as combined mayo subscores of 1 or less for rectal bleeding plus stool frequency steroid-free clinical response defined as either a decrease of 3 points or more on the mayo score a 50 or greater reduction from baseline in combined rectal bleeding plus stool frequency mayo subscores or both steroid-free endoscopic response defined as a mayo endoscopy subscore of 1 or less with a reduction of at least 1 point from baseline steroid-free endoscopic remission defined as a mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 quality of life assessed with the ibdq10 and safety assessed by adverse events.statistical analysisbased on limited available data15 and anecdotal experience at the time the study was designed we predicted remission would be 60 with faecal microbiota transplantation and 15 with placebo we estimated the proportion of dropouts at 30. we planned 40 patients per group for recruitment to ensure a greater than 80 probability of showing a difference between treatment groups with a two-sided a of 005 on modified intention-to-treat analysis.the modified intention-to-treat analysis included all patients who received at least one study dose.

81 patients received at least one dose of study treatment 41 assigned faecal microbiota transplantation 40 allocated placebo and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis figure 1. the two study groups were well matched for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics table 1. however by chance significantly more patients allocated placebo had the mildest endoscopic disease mayo score 1 severity assessment for residual confounding by multivariate analysis was limited by the sample size.table 2 presents outcome data at week 8.

one donor d054 seemed to be associated with benefit in a post-hoc analysis 14 37 of 38 patients treated with faecal microbiota transplantation that contained a sample from this donor blinded and open- label met criteria for the primary outcome compared with seven 18 of 40 patients whose faecal microbiota transplantation did not include a sample from this donor p0054.figure 2 case examples of primary outcome after faecal microbiota transplantationa b 37-year-old woman with a 4-year history of left-sided ulcerative colitis and acute colitis diarrhoea six times per day with bleeding despite maximum oral and topical 5-aminosalicylate treatment.

87 taxa were associated significantly with the primary outcome in masked patients appendix pp 79-82 versus 46 taxa in open-label patients appendix pp 83-85. several microbial taxa were associated with remission after double-blind faecal microbiota transplantation eg barnesiella spp parabacteroides spp clostridium cluster iv and ruminococcus spp and after open-label faecal microbiota transplantation eg blautia spp dorea spp ruminococcus 2 and clostridium cluster xviii.
