to evaluate the potential of ticks to carry bacterial pathogens specifically bacterial dna it is imperative to obtain a high quality and quantity of bacterial dna in order to enable unbiased tick surveys.next-generation sequencing ngs technologies have seen a shift in tick microbial studies from targeting indi- vidual bacterial species to sequencing whole tick assem- blages however a universal consensus on the optimal dna extraction protocol for hard tick species is still lacking a significant issue when the hard chitinous exoskeleton and multiple life stages of ixodid ticks are considered     dna extraction is a critical component of microbiota studies due to its influence on the abundance and diversity of bacterial species identified -determining the bias of dna extraction methods towards or away from certain bacter- ial groups is confounded by variability introduced before the dna is even extracted due to the heterogeneity of the individual tick and their small size thus there is a need to determine the bias of dna extraction methods on a homogenous tick population.the aim of this study was to assess which combination of dna extraction method with 16s ribosomal rrna hypervariable region through ngs sequencing gave the greatest bacterial diversity and enabled the identification of borrelia spp.

the approach has enabled us to objectively propose an optimised workflow for the detec- tion of borrelia and rickettsia species in ticks.analysis of the 16s rrna gene can be used to identify bacterial communities the 16s rrna gene contains nine hypervariable regions v1-v9 each region however shows a different capacity to de- fine bacterial diversity therefore no single region is able to differentiate all microbiota within the community of a tick  our results are in line with these findings as the v1-v3 16s rrna gene diversity profiling assay identified a larger number of families while the v3-v4 16s rrna gene diversity profiling assay identified a larger number of genera.

diversity analyses showed no significant differences in the level of bacterial diversity between v1-v3 and v3-v4 16s rrna hypervariable re- gions or method 1 and method 2 despite an increasingtrend in the diversity of v3-v4 16s rrna hypervariable region and method 2. traditionally the v3-v4 16s rrna hypervariable region is preferred because diversity estimates for bacterial communities are often the highest nevertheless sequencing errors potentially result in an overestimation of the microbiome increased diver- sity and bacterial taxa identification with a single region being unable to identify all microbiota in a community a wider span of the microbiome is achieved when multiple 16s rrna hypervariable regions are combined the design of the current study included obtaining near identical subsamples of each tick providing us with the ability to demonstrate the effect of dna isolation method as a significant source of variability.
