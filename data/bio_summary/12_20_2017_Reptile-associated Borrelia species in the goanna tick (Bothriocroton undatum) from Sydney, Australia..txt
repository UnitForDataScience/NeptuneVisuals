To evaluate the potential of ticks to carry bacterial pathogens specifically bacterial DNA it is imperative to obtain a high quality and quantity of bacterial DNA in order to enable unbiased tick surveys.Next-generation sequencing NGS technologies have seen a shift in tick microbial studies from targeting indi- vidual bacterial species to sequencing whole tick assem- blages However a universal consensus on the optimal DNA extraction protocol for hard tick species is still lacking a significant issue when the hard chitinous exoskeleton and multiple life stages of ixodid ticks are considered     DNA extraction is a critical component of microbiota studies due to its influence on the abundance and diversity of bacterial species identified -Determining the bias of DNA extraction methods towards or away from certain bacter- ial groups is confounded by variability introduced before the DNA is even extracted due to the heterogeneity of the individual tick and their small size Thus there is a need to determine the bias of DNA extraction methods on a homogenous tick population.The aim of this study was to assess which combination of DNA extraction method with 16S ribosomal rRNA hypervariable region through NGS sequencing gave the greatest bacterial diversity and enabled the identification of Borrelia spp.

The approach has enabled us to objectively propose an optimised workflow for the detec- tion of Borrelia and Rickettsia species in ticks.Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene can be used to identify bacterial communities The 16S rRNA gene contains nine hypervariable regions V1-V9 Each region however shows a different capacity to de- fine bacterial diversity therefore no single region is able to differentiate all microbiota within the community of a tick  Our results are in line with these findings as the V1-V3 16S rRNA gene diversity profiling assay identified a larger number of families while the V3-V4 16S rRNA gene diversity profiling assay identified a larger number of genera.

Shannon diversity indices H' demonstrated no significant difference in the level of bacterial diversity between V1-V3 and V3-V4 16S rRNA gene diversity profiling assays paired t-test t5  1.4561 P  0.05 paired t-test t5  0.6848 P  0.05 or between Method 1 and Method 2 paired t-test t5  0.1419 P  0.05 paired t-test t5  1.3524 P  0.05 Table A large proportion of bacterial genera and classes were unique to either the V1-V3 or V3-V4 16S rRNA gene diversity profiling assays Fig.

The evolutionary history of tick cox1 gene sequences was inferred using the Minimum Evolution ME method with model selection based on maximum likelihood in MEGA7 v.7.0.14 Bootstrap support was calculated as a percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together as implemented in MEGA7.Next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene ampliconsTick DNA samples Tick1-6 were subjected to 16S rRNA gene diversity profiling assays at the Australian Genome Research Facility Brisbane Australia.

16S rRNA gene sequences was inferred using the Minimum Evolution ME method with model selection based on maximum likelihood in MEGA7v.7.0.14 Bootstrap support was calculated as a percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together as implemented in MEGA7.Quantification of bacteria using real-time PCRBacterial load was determined using a universal bacterial real-time PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene 38.

The nested 23S rRNA gene PCR performed on Tick1- 6 revealed the presence of Borrelia spirochetes in Tick2 from DNA isolated using both Method 1 and Method 2 222-nt product while the remaining five ticks were PCR negative.We subsequently inquired into the presence of Borrelia spp.

The Qubit dsDNA HS assay found the average quantity of DNA for Method 1 and Method 2 to be 21 ngml and 51 ngml respectively Additional file  Table S2.The greater tick microbiome diversity using a combination of 16S rRNA assaysTicks n  6 Tick1-6 were longitudinally bisected.

Diversity analyses showed no significant differences in the level of bacterial diversity between V1-V3 and V3-V4 16S rRNA hypervariable re- gions or Method 1 and Method 2 despite an increasingtrend in the diversity of V3-V4 16S rRNA hypervariable region and Method 2.
