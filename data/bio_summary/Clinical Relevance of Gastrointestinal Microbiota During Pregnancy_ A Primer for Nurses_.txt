this information is essential for practitioners so that they are able to provide care that accounts for changes in the gi microbiota that could influence health outcomes.overview of the gi microbiotaorganization of the gi microbiota by taxonomic rank or enterotypesmicrobes in the gi tract comprise the most abundant diverse and complex microbial ecosystem compared to those in other regions of the body.

knowledge about the structure of the gi microbiota more generally will serve as a foundation to understanding its functions as they relate to pregnancy.composition and relative abundancedespite the paucity of studies on the structure of the gi micro- biota during pregnancy investigators have studied the compo- sition and relative abundance within the gi microbiota before and during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period table 2. in one study utilizing an animal model that examined the composition of the gi microbiota prior to and throughout pregnancy researchers found significantly increased relative abundance of mucin-degrading microbes including akkerman- sia verrucomicrobia phylum and bifidobacterium actino- bacteria phylum in pregnant versus nonpregnant mice gohir whelan surette moore  jonathan 2015. the find- ings also showed that akkermansia remained elevated through- out pregnancy.

2012.understanding what an optimal structure for the maternal gi microbiota looks like is crucial because the microbes are hypothesized to pass through the permeable mucosal surface of the maternal gi tract into the blood stream and translocate to the placenta and intra-amniotic fluid where they are ingested by the fetus and colonize the fetal gi tract jime'nez et al.

2012 vujic knez stefanovic  vrbanovic 2013. this growing body of evidence provides insights that support the critical role that the structure of the maternal gi microbiota plays in the initial microbial colonization of the fetus and neonate which may predispose the child to different health trajectories ajslev andersen gamborg sorensen  jess 2011 johansson sjogren persson nilsson  sverremark-ekstrom 2011 kalliomaki collado salminen  isolauri 2008 rautava luoto salminen  isolauri 2012 renz brandtzaeg  hornef 2012.the gi microbiota during pregnancyvery few studies have examined the structure of the gi micro- biota during pregnancy.

2012. in the neonate the t3 gi microbiota is needed to extract addi- tional energy and promote gluconeogenesis during the first few days of life when the volume of colostrum produced is low konstantinov van der woude  peppelenbosch 2013.in the study mentioned above that examined the gi micro- bial composition from t1 to t3 researchers reported that the composition of the gi microbiota during t3 is preserved into the early postpartum period in a subset of women koren et al.

2012. in another study that examined the relative abundance of gi microbiota in seven healthy pregnant women from t3 to 1-month postpartum researchers showed that the relative abun- dance of the gi microbial community is relatively stable during that period jost lacroix braegger  chassard 2014. reten- tion of a pro-inflammatory gi microbial composition into the postpartum period is likely related to the additional energy needs of the lactating mother since it promotes increased energy extraction koren et al.
