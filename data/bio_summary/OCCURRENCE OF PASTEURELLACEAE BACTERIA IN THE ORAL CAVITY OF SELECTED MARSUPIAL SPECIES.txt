Sequence comparison and phyloge- netic analysis of the rpoB gene sequences charac- terized resulted in five distinct groups as outlined in Figure 1. rpoB sequencing was selected be- cause the resolution of the rpoB gene within the family Pasteurellaceae generally is greater than that of the 16S rRNA.12Twenty-one strains isolated from long-nosed potoroos 5 spotted-tailed quolls 10 and east- ern quolls 6 made up group 1 which classified with the type strain of Frederiksenia canicola CCUG 22043T at 96.9-98.8 rpoB sequence similarity.

However additional geno- and phenotypic testing is needed to confirm this.Finally 29 strains from Tasmanian Devils 8 spotted-tailed quolls 7 and eastern quolls 14 formed group 5 with a 94.2-100 rpoB sequence similarity within the group.

The group showed 95.6-100 rpoB similarity to 15 strains of Pasteu- rellaceae bacteria previously isolated from Tas- manian devils.4 The strains previously described by Brix et al4 are likely to represent a novel species within a new genus of Pasteurellaceae and the rpoB similarities strongly indicates that the strains of group 5 also represent members of this yet unnamed taxa.

Twenty-one strains from long-nosed potoroos Potorous tridactylus apicalis spotted-tailed quolls Dasyurus maculatus and eastern quolls Dasyurus viverrinus made up group 1 which classified with Frederiksenia canicola.

Finally 29 strains from Tasmanian devils spotted-tailed quolls and eastern quolls formed group 5 and clustered with 15 previously described Tasmanian devil strains belonging to a yet unnamed Pasteurellaceae taxon.

Samples were obtained from 2 common ring- tailed possums 11 common wombats 13 spotted- tailed quolls 22 eastern quolls 3 koalas 9 Tasmanian devils and 5 long-nosed potoroos.Swabs obtained were kept at 4-208C for up to 16 hr before they were plated on 5 Columbia sheep blood agar BA plates Micromedia Melbourne Victoria 3825 Australia.

The strains from long-nosed potoroos were isolated from animals sharing an enclosure whereas strains from spotted-tailed quolls and eastern quolls were isolated from animals from four and two different locations respectively.

E.C.P.V.S.Abstract Eighty-two Pasteurellaceae isolates from marsupials characterized by phylogenetic analysis of rpoB gene sequences formed five distinct groups.

Phylogenetic relationships between isolates of bacteria related to members of Pasteurellaceae based on maximum-likelihood analysis of partial rpoB sequences.

The partial rpoB gene sequence was obtained from 82 isolates Table S1 using primers adapted from Mollet et al13 to PCR- amplify and sequence a 520 bp fragment of the gene covering region 509-680 positions refer to Escherichia coli K12 association number U00096 of the deduced protein sequence as reportedpreviously.12 Sequencing was performed by Mac- rogen Europe 1105 AZ Amsterdam-Zuidoost the Netherlands.
