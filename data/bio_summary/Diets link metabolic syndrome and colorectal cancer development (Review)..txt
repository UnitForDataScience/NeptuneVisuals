In addition to T cells B cells have also shown a positive association with obesity in high-fat diet-fed mice because infiltration of B cells can be found in the adipose tissue of obese mice and these cells can activate T cells and polarize macrophages toward the M1 type 83.

An increased number of Th17 cells in thespleen has been found in mice fed a high-fat diet but this cell was absent in IL-6-- mice fed the same high-fat diet indicating that IL-6 is important for Th17 expansion in obesity 80.CD8 T cells are another type of lymphocytes that may be involved in obesity development since co-cultures of splenic CD8 T cells with adipose tissue from high-fat diet mice showed a higher proliferation rate of CD8 T cells than those of the lean controls 81.

Leptin also has an anti-apoptotic role in human colon cancer cell lines and promotes the proliferation of normal colonic epithelial and cancer cells as the Wnt signaling pathway a key pathway in CRC can be activated by leptin leading to CRC cell proliferation in vitro 141 while leptin-deficient mice showed a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth 142.

However the number of Treg cells was decreased in the adipose tissue of obese mice but insulin sensitivity can also be improved when these cells are increased 78.

By using neutralizing antibodies against the B cells other studies have found that obesity-induced insulin resistance in mice could be improved and a reduction in M1 macrophages and activation of CD8 T cells along with an increase in Treg numbers and M2 signatures could be observed in the adipose tissue 8386.

Although there are several lymphocyte cell types that are related to obesity and metabolic syndrome pro-inflammatory Th1 Th17 and CD8 T cells predominate over anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells Treg and Th2 cells which are found in higher proportions in lean adipose tissue 7778.

The recovery of CD8 T cells in knockout mice exacerbated obesity-induced insulin resistance and this was correlated with increased M1 macrophages and IL-6 and TNF-a gene expression in adipose tissue 81.B lymphocyte.

Although insulin and IGFs are produced by b-cells in the pancreas and liver respectively not in adipose tissue these factors still play a role in CRC cell proliferation and the progression of cancer both in vitro and in vivo.

ATMs appear to play a major role in the regulation of obesity-induced inflammation as ATMs generally play a key role in most cases of chronic inflammation and these cells can comprise up to 40 of the cells in the adipose tissue 58.

Although B cells are associated with the inflammatory condi- tion in obesity regulatory B cells which produce IL-10 have been shown to improve insulin resistance and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the skeletal muscles of mice fed a high-fat diet 83.
