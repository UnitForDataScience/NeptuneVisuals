Due to this apparent extended specificity to- wards xenobiotics such as alafosfalin beta-lactams ACE in- hibitors immunomodulatory agents and antipsychotic drugs e hPepT1 is being used in the design and enhancement of bioavailability of several drugs in particular those that are distributed orally an example of this is valacyclovir .

The human POT hPepT1 is known to transport a number of drugs.

The transport of these drugs was evaluated using the prototypical POT YdgR from E. coli.

In particular it prompted two different questions first if commonly used orally administered drugs already are substrates of the microbiome and second are there transport systems in the gut microbes that can be used for uptake of foreign molecules The fact that several genomes of the microbiota contain POT genes is an interesting coincidence for instance one of the major components of the gut microbiome Escherichia coli contains four POT genes ydgR yhiP yjdL and ybgH .

For all drugs parent ions and strong reaction product ions have already been established e. The parent ionproductions are sulpiride 342.4112.2 valacyclovir 325152.2 bes- tatin 309120 oseltamivir 313166 ampicillin 349160 and levodopa 197.3107.2.

The pellet was re-suspended in 100 mL ice-cold MQ water and vortexed for 30 s. The cell suspension was sonicated Fischer Scientific for 30 s and centrifuged again for 20 min at 14000 rpm to obtain cell lysate.

The injected analyte after passing through the LC was sprayed using electrospray ionization ESI in a mass spectrometer with a capillary voltage of 2750 V. The ion trap was set at 50000 ions filling with a speed of 13000 mz per second.

As part of ongoing studies on substrate specificities of POTs from Escherichia coli our aim in this study was to investigate whether bacterial POTs could also transport these drugs.

For this we selected the common orally administered drugs sulpiride bestatin valacyclovir ampicillin and oseltamivir that are all transported by hPepT1.
