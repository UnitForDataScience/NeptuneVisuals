Among those the most numerous descriptions indicate its role in plant nutrient acquisition  and protection against stresses  one of the key determinants of plant health and produc- tivity and by using this knowledge in agriculture we will efficiently enable plant microbiome management.The role of microbiome on plant evolution The evolutionary history of plants shows its origin on aquatic environment with further colonization of terrestrial systems 450 million years ago .

The exposal of plants to patho- gens or extreme events of temperature chemicals or antibiotics can strongly influence the composition of its microbiome .Microorganisms are able to readily colonize any niche found in plants coming either through soil wind air or water and different plant compartments harbor their own particular microbial community  microbial niches are found along a plant and differences on the microbiome composition can be found among them.

The term holobiont is suggested as the host plant interacting to its associated symbiotic community  whose ecology and evolution cannot be disconnected  concept requires the view of all functions and interactions between plants and microorganisms as an individual where a great portion of the functioning and variability among individuals populations or races is attributed to the microorganisms which forms together with the plant the unit where evolution and adaptation processes will act upon .The plant-associated microbiome has greatly expanded the metabolic capacity of plants and also increased the efficiency in resource uptake providing novel nutritional and defense pathways to be explored by the host.

Similar relationships are observed for plants where the influence of the root microbiome on plant health is clearly evidenced in dis- ease-suppressive soils  and with plant-growth promot- ing rhizobacteria PGPR Although plant domestication has contributed enor- mously to human civilization it has also caused a strong decrease in the genetic diversity of modern crops and altered their associated microbiome.

In general it has been demonstrated that along the genetic breeding of plants the metabolism is focused to produce more biomass or specific resistances in detriment of the nutritional support to feed beneficial microbes in their roots vicinity  the opposite way that plants used to evolve until its present form that will surely have consequences in plant development such as the high dependency of the artifi- cial supply of nutrients and protection against stressors.Hitherto the exploration of plant microbiomes in agricultureIn nature plants associate with a multitude of microor- ganisms as they interplay along their development with an interface of highly diverse systems.

In addition the description of plant microbiomes also indicates the great variability of its composition depending on stage of plant development .

Along their evolution plants learned to interact to soil microbiota extracting their utmost capacity to provide resources for plant development and successful colonization of terrestrial systems where the great soil biodiversity is keen on properly exert this role.

In counterpart the anthropogenic activity mainly in forms of agricultural managements has neglected this symbiosis interfering in soil biodiversity and consequently reducing plant development through the interference in their association with beneficial microbes.

The plant microbiome can be comprised of a myriad of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms including bacteria archaea viruses fungi and protozo- ans which are known as having the ability to control several host features such as metabolism nutrition phys- iology and immunology .

The microbiome composition is also highly variable according to plant species  developmental stage  or even between highly similar plants with small differences on its genetic backgrounds as the transgenics .
