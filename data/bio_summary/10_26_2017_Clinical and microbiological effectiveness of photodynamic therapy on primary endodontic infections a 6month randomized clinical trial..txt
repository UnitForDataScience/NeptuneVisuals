For the test group one additional PDTstep was carried out where- as for the control group the operator simulated a session of PDT by inserting the optical fiber into the canal without irra- diation so that patients were blind to treatments.Treatment protocolSixteen patients were allocated in each therapeutic group control CMD  intracanal medication and PDT CMD  PDT  intracanal medication.

In this parallel- randomized controlled clinical trial RCT we hypothesized that PDT combined to conventional endodontic therapy would demonstrate superior healing and greater reduction of micro- organisms than conventional therapy alone in the treatment of necrotic endodontic primary infection.

Other species still detected after treat- ment in the control 10 species and PDT 11 species groups included Actinomyces naeslundii I Campylobacter rectus Capnocytophaga s pp.

Most species reduced over time in both groups and no significant differences in frequency and levels of the tested species were observed between groups in any time point evaluated.albicans and D. pneumosintes were still detected in high frequency in both groups at 3 months post-therapy.

The sampling time points were T1 baseline just before CMD T2 after CMD  final irrigation for the control group or after CMD  PDT  final irrigation for the PDT group and T3 right before root canal filling.

Regarding the effect of PDT on C. albicans some studies indicate that PDT is a promising new alternative for treatment of oral candidiasis or even endodontic infections - however variable antimicrobial efficacy has been reported    .

Despite the microbial diversity conventional endodontic therapy with or without PDT led to similar and significant decrease in the majority of the species evaluated.

and .Clinical and microbiological data correlationIn order to determine whether specific microbial species ana- lyzed at different time points during treatment were related to periapical healing at 6 months post-therapy the PAI scores were categorized into healed scores 1 and 2 and not healed scores 3-5 and the mean counts of species compared be- tween these categories within each group.

Further long-term RCTs are imperative for measuring the clinical and microbiological effects of PDT as an adjunct to conventional endodontic treatment.Funding information This study was supported in part by National Council for Scientific and Technological Development CNPqCoordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel CAPES and Foundation for Research Financial Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro FAPERJ Brazil.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Ethical approval All procedures performed involving human partici- pants were in accordance and approved with the ethical standards by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Federal University of Rio de Janeiro UFRJ protocol 707.472 and conducted in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 Statement.Informed consent For this type of study informed consent was obtain- ed from all individual participants included in the study.ReferencesSiqueira JF Rocas IN 2009 Diversity of endodontic microbiota revisited.
