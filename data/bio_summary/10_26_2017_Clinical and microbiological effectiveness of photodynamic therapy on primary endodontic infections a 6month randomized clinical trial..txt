However at the final radiographic eval- uation 6-month follow-up teeth from the PDT group pre- sented significantly lower PAI scores than teeth treated only by conventional therapy.

Therefore even with the detection of remaining microorganisms inside the root system canal periapical healing may occur with proper cleaning shaping and root filling.

According to our findings even though microbial DNA could be detected in 50 of all teeth after treatment and before rootcanal filling high rates of periapical healing 62.5 of all teeth were observed at 6 months of radiographic monitoring in both groups.

For the test group one additional PDTstep was carried out where- as for the control group the operator simulated a session of PDT by inserting the optical fiber into the canal without irra- diation so that patients were blind to treatments.Treatment protocolSixteen patients were allocated in each therapeutic group control CMD  intracanal medication and PDT CMD  PDT  intracanal medication.

The sampling time points were T1 baseline just before CMD T2 after CMD  final irrigation for the control group or after CMD  PDT  final irrigation for the PDT group and T3 right before root canal filling.

In this parallel- randomized controlled clinical trial RCT we hypothesized that PDT combined to conventional endodontic therapy would demonstrate superior healing and greater reduction of micro- organisms than conventional therapy alone in the treatment of necrotic endodontic primary infection.

Even though extreme care was taken during caries excavation and access to root canal at baseline including continuous disinfection of the pulp cham- ber with sodium hypochlorite during therapy and at the final sampling contamination of root canal samples withalbicans from deep carious lesions should be considered justifying the high frequency of this species before and after treatment.
