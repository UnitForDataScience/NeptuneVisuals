A comparison of A. suum L4 detected in the small intestine indicated that pigs fed LGG  CP had more L4 than pigs fed the other diets with a significant difference when compared to LGG fed pigs.

Pigs fed LGG  CP also had a significantly lower level of circulating IgG2 antibodies to Ascaris-derived antigens when compared to pigs fed CP p  0.05 suggesting that a weaker antibody response in pigs fed LGG  CP enhanced L4 survival.

Different letters denote differences among treatments after ANOVA p  0.05.Abundance of Lactobacillus Rhamnosus in FecesThe abundance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus significantly increased in fecal samples from pigs fed LGG compared to the control pigs at Weeks 4 and 7 p  0.05 and in pigs fed LGG  CP at Week 7.

In this study pigs fed LGG and infected with A. suum had a reduced expression of EPX CCL26 and IL-13 p  0.05 with no change in gene expression of these three genes when pigs were fed LGG  CP or CP alone.

Labeled means without a common superscript letter differ p  0.05.Toll-Like Receptor Gene Expression in the Draining Lymph NodesPigs fed the control diet had levels of TLR2 TLR4 TLR9 and IL1B gene expression in TBLN that were significantly p  0.05 greater than in pigs fed LGG Figure .

No differences in TLR2 TLR4 and TLR9 gene expression were observed data not shown.Antibody Response to Ascaris suumThe serum IgG2 antibody response to A. suum larval antigens was reduced in pigs fed LGG  CP compared to those fed CP alone p  0.03 Figure .

The dose fed in our study was selected to be comparable to that fed to humans  where cocoa derived metabolites were reportedly absorbed and distributed to tissues .

This study compared the host response to infection with Ascaris suum in three-month-old pigs fed a standard growth diet supplemented with a vehicle control LGG cocoa powder CP or LGG  CP.

Lactobacillus abundance was increased in pigs fed LGG or LGG  CP.

suum IgG2 antibodies were decreased p  0.05 in LGG  CP-fed pigs compared to pigs fed CP alone.
