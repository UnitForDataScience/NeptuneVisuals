the heated springs and hydrothermal features of yellowstone national park are ideal locations to find thesepotentially unclassified cellulolytic thermophiles.five individual water samples were removed from whiterock springs a hydrother- mal feature along solfatara creek trail yellowstone national park wy usa and vacuum-filtrated through 0.22-um filters.
