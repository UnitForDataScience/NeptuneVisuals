Our results shed first light on the microbiome of edible plants and open the door to harnessing the Brassica microbiome for plant disease resistance and human health.The plant microbiome has been intensively studied for more than a centurybut recently developed omics tech- nologies provide much deeper insights into the plant-associated microbial diversity.

Our results indicate the plant genotype to be the main driver of the microbiome composition of all plant parts and plant-associated bacteria to improve the health benefits of the vegetable consumption.

The highly abundant fraction of the microbiome of all vegetables 1 abundance was dominated by Proteobacteria 75 followed by Bacteriodetes 19 and Actinobacteria Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes each with 2.The influence of plant genotype and processing pathway on the vegetable microbi- omes.

The importance of the plant microbiome as key determinants of plant health and productivity has been also known since long time.

With that we demonstrated that the plant genotype is the main driver of the microbiome of all plant parts.

Plant and Soil 3121-2 7-14 2008.Mendes R. Garbeva P.  Raaijmakers J. M. The rhizosphere microbiome significance of plant beneficial plant pathogenic and human pathogenic microorganisms.

Strains which were able to suppress plant pathogens were isolated from naturally processed vegetables and represent a substantial part 4.1 of all vegetable microbiomes.

BLASTx alignment of all hits to NCBI nonredundant protein database showed 100 sequence similarity to 6-phospho-b-glucosidases bacterial myrosinase.The microbiome of Brassica vegetables as a source for biological control agents BCA.

The enrichment of microorganisms by the plant root is not a random but rather a tar- geted process the current model shows the involvement of seed-borne microorganisms and the attraction of microbes from the soilin combination with plant-specific secondary metabolites acting as repellentsand plant defense signaling.

Kill or cure The interaction between endophytic Paenibacillus and Serratia strains and the host plant is shaped by plant growth conditions.
