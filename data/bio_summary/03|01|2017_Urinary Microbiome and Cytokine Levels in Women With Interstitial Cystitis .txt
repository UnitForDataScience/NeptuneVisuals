3 MARCH 2017OBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYfor the development of infectious and obstetric complications.1-6Evidence for protective microbial communities specifically those of the gastrointestinal tract has led to investigations of the role played by the human microbiome in health and well-being.78 Such research includes the identification of a biodiverse urinary mi- crobiome that is not isolated by conventional culture.9 Similar to the influence of microbial communities in the vagina and gastrointestinal tract alterations to the urinary microbiome may have an effect on the devel- opment of lower urinary tract dysfunction.Characterized by suprapubic pain and urinary frequency interstitial cystitis is a debilitating condi- tion with an estimated prevalence of 3-8 million U.S. women.10 The etiology of interstitial cystitis remains elusive treatment is variable and often unsatisfac- tory11 and affected individuals exhibit higher rates of psychiatric diagnoses and other chronic pain con- ditions.1213 Although an inflammatory component of interstitial cystitis has been suggested little is known regarding the possible role played by the urinary mi- crobiome and its effect on the immune response.1415 Our primary outcome was to investigate measur- able differences in the urinary microbiota and cyto- kine levels that exist among women with interstitial cystitis compared with healthy women.

Original ResearchUrinary Microbiome and Cytokine Levels in Women With Interstitial CystitisMelinda G. Abernethy MD Amy Rosenfeld PhD James R. White PhD Margaret G. Mueller MD Christina Lewicky-Gaupp MD and Kimberly Kenton MDOBJECTIVE To investigate differences in the urinary microbiome and cytokine levels between women with and without interstitial cystitis and to correlate differ- ences with scores on standardized symptom severity scales and depression and anxiety screening tools.METHODS Our cross-sectional study compared women presenting to a pelvic floor clinic and diagnosed with interstitial cystitis over a 6-month period with age- matched women in a control group from the same institution.

Specific to bladder pain syndromes a Norwegian study compared sequences of clean catch urine samples from eight women with interstitial cystitis to healthy women.23 Although their analysis noted a relative increase in lactobacilli in the urine of women with interstitial cystitis our study used straight catheterized specimens which better reflect the urinary microbiome than voided specimens.9 It is plausible that their collec- tion technique affected the analyzed microbial compo- sition.

Nonparametric analyses were used for all comparisons.RESULTS Participants with interstitial cystitis reported more disability bothersome urinary symptoms genito- urinary pain and sexual dysfunction and scored higher on depression and anxiety screens compared with women in the control group.

No associa- tions between the presence of lactobacillus species and cytokine levels were observed.CONCLUSION The urinary microbiome of participants with interstitial cystitis was less diverse less likely to contain Lactobacillus species and associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

Female patients 21 years and older presenting to the Women's Integrated Pelvic Health Program and diagnosed with interstitial cystitis were approached for participation.

The diagnosis of interstitial cystitis was based on symptoms of urinary frequency and supra- pubic or bladder pain for at least 6 months.

Exclusion criteria included recurrent or current urinary tract infection urethral strictures iatrogenic cystitis blad- der augmentation autoimmune disorder neuromus- cular disease nonskin cancer high-grade cervical dysplasia current pregnancy or current antibiotic use.
