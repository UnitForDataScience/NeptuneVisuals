As shown in  western blot results confirmed that the mice protected against tumor onset produced higher levels of the active form of caspase-7 compared to the non-protected mouse.Altogether these data suggest that L. casei BL23 has an anti- proliferative and apoptotic effect in this CRC model a detailed proposal of the mechanisms of action of L. casei BL23 against CRC is shown in .impact of L. casei Bl23 Treatment on Microbiota richness and DiversityTo determine the impact of L. casei BL23 on the gut microbiota we analyzed microbiota richness and diversity after BL23 oral treatment.

However the beneficial role of L. casei BL23 in colitis-associated CRC such as that induced by AOM-DSS remains to be assessed.Thus keeping in mind the role of the gut microbiota and chronic intestinal inflammation in CRC carcinogenesis we decided in this study to further investigate the impact of L. casei BL23 in a mouse model of CRC induced by AOM and DSS.

Our results show that L. casei BL23 significantly protected mice against CRC development specifically L. casei BL23 treatment reduced histological scores and proliferative index values.

In addition L. casei BL23 was also able to increase apoptosis via upregulation of caspase-9 caspase-7 and Bik.Given the reported anti-inflammatory properties of L. casei BL23 we also assessed the cytokine profiles of treated mice.

Few individual species were affected by L. casei treatment with the exception of L. zeae which is actually considered a synonym ofL.

Altogether our results demonstrate the high potential of L. casei BL23 for the development of new probiotic-based strategies to fight CRC.Keywords Lactobacillus casei Bl23 lactic acid bacteria probiotic azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate colorectal cancer immunomodulationinTrODUcTiOnColorectal cancer CRC is a major public health problem and is considered the third most com- mon cancer around the world with nearly 1.2 million new cases every year and a mortality rate of 40 .

casei Bl23 Protects against Tumor Development in a colitis-associated crc ModelTo determine the potential beneficial effects of the dairy strain BL23 of L. casei on CRC onset live bacteria were orally adminis- tered to mice treated with AOM and DSS.

casei Bl23 Displays antiproliferative activitiesAs immunomodulation and the induction of cell apoptosis are among the main probiotic-related protective mechanisms against CRC we examined changes in both the immune response and apoptosis pathways due to L. casei BL23 treatment.

Indeed 16S RNA analysis has revealed a close relationship 99 similarity between our focal strain and L. zeae .DiscUssiOnThere is now mounting evidence pointing to an important link between both chronic colic and rectal damage present for example in IBD patients and CRC carcinogenesis.

In particular L. casei BL23 has antiproliferative effects in the mouse allograft model of HPV-induced cancer and protects against DMH-induced CRC .
