Our results are in support of those previous data and suggest that pulmonary inflammation can alter the composition of the gut microbiome through yet unidentified pathways.ConclusionsThe SP-D deficient genotype does not cause alterations to the microbiota that interfere with the use of the SP-D deficient mice for immunological research.

Barfod M. Roggenbuck.1 These authors contributed equally to this work.AbstractBackground SP-D is an important host defense lectin in innate immunity and SP-D deficient mice show several abnormal immune effects and are susceptible to allergen- induced airway disease.

Moreover airway inflammation and allergic asthma is associated with increases in SP-D levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids tissue and blood in animal models as well as in human patients linking SP-D to disease responses .

This is an open access article under the CC BY license Results We describe here for the first time the lung and gut microbiota of the SP-D mouse model with OVA induced allergic airway disease.

Future mechanistic investigations of the influence of induced allergic airway disease on gut microbiota are warranted.Keywords Microbiology ImmunologyBackgroundSurfactant protein-D SP-D belongs to the collectin family of host defense proteins.

Recently we have shown that induction of OVA- induced allergic airway disease itself had a profound effect on the lung microbiome in a vitamin D deficient mouse BALBcJ model .The role of SP-D in regulation of the gut and lung microbiome composition in the setting of pulmonary allergy has not previously been investigated.

In this study we investigate for the first time microbiota of Sftpd-- and Sftpd mice in ovalbumin OVA induced airway allergy using Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing.ResultsWe have used NGS 16S rRNA gene sequencing to describe lung and gut microbiota of the SP-D mouse model under OVA induced allergic airway disease.Sequence quality and overall microbial communitiesAfter sequence retrieval and initial data treatment 869802 reads were divided into 697 Operational taxonomic units OTUs with a median sequence distribution of 13685 sequences per sample.

SP-D gut microbiota samples are more variable.

It is worth noting that there were only mild allergic differences between OVA-sensitized and challenged Sftpd and Sftpd-- making it possible to separate the effects of SP-D and allergy on the gut microbiota.Fig.7TDFIGFig.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that microbiome composition would change with the lack of SP-D protein and presence of allergic airway disease in the widely used SP-D-deficient mouse model.2405-8440 c 2017 The Authors.
