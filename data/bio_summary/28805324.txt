2017217057.DOI 10.1111apt.14237Editorial probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease--wrong organisms wrong disease or flawed concepts Authors' replyProfessor Shanahan highlights many of the methodological limita- tions of trials of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease IBD which we do not dispute.

Furthermore whether the effect of these preparations on disease activity and symptom reporting in IBD is associated with any demonstrable alterations in the microbiome metabolome or proteome is unre- ported by the majority of authors despite these being the putative mechanisms by which probiotics are proposed to impart their beneficial effects.Conclusions drawn from the results of meta-analyses of probiotics in IBD should bear these limitations in mind.

20173891218- 1228.DOI 10.1111apt.14230Editorial probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease--wrong organisms wrong disease or flawed conceptsWhen the number of meta-analyses and systematic reviews of any treatment approaches or exceeds that of primary research studies it may be time to reconsider the entire concept or move on.

In addition they have been conducted using a rela- tively small sample of bacterial species in heterogeneous patient populations using divergent outcome measures largely focussing on the evaluation of symptoms rather than objective measures of inflammatory disease activity disease activity.

Is this because we haven't tested the correct organisms cor- rect combination of organisms or the correct subsets of patients or because of flawed concepts of host-microbe interactions in inflam- matory bowel disease IBDThe notion of using live microbes to treat IBD has always been intriguing more because of implicit problems conundrums and con- fusion than for any consistent benefit in humans.23 The word probi- otics is imprecise and lends itself to the commonly mistaken assumption that all such organisms are equal.

These are operationally referred to as next-generation probiotics or live biotherapeutics.4 They promise new benefits and challenges but are likely to be developed as pharmaceuticals rather than supplements and accord- ingly will require a higher level of regulatory scrutiny.c 2017 John Wiley  Sons LtdOf course abnormal host-microbe interactions are germane not only to the pathogenesis of IBD but also to the risk of extra-intest- inal associations manifestations and complications including bacte- rial translocation sepsis and progression to dysplasia or carcinogenesis.3 The role for first- and next-generation probiotics or other microbial-based interventions for these aspects of the disease remains to be assessed.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Declaration of personal interests FS is a co-founder shareholder in Atlantia Food Clinical Trials 4D pharma Cork Ltd Alimentary Health Ltd.

Is this because rodent models do not reflect the hetero- geneity of human IBD Host-microbe interactions in rodents inbred and raised in captivity may be too limited to reflect the complexity of what occurs in outbred humans.Although the candidate probiotics tested in IBD seem to be extensive and diverse they are in fact from a relatively narrow range of organisms mainly Lactobacillus spp.

The reanalysis by Derwa et al.1 overcomes the limitations of previous reports over the past two decades but the outcome is essentially the same--live microbes referred to as probiotics don't help patients with Crohn's disease and have limited impact on ulcerative colitis.

Systematic review with meta- analysis efficacy of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.

For example some but not all organisms tested for pro- biotic activity have reported benefits in irritable bowel syndrome.3Most of the organisms tested in the recent meta-analysis of IBD never actually qualified for the stated definition a health benefit when provided in adequate amounts.
