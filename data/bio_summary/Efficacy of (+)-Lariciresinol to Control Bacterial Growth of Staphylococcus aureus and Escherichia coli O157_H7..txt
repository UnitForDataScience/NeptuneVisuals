In this assay  - lariciresinol exhibited consistent antibacterial effect however theTABLE 1  Antibacterial activity of -lariciresinol against foodborne pathogens S. aureus KCTC1621 and E. coli O157H7.Pathogens-LariciresinolZones of inhibitionaSusceptibilityMICbMBCcStaphylococcus aureus KCTC162114.9 - 0.2125 125Escherichia coli O157H712.1 - 0.3250 250 a Diameters of inhibition zones in millimeter b Minimum inhibitory concentration values in ugmL c Minimum bactericidal concentration values in ugmL.

Interestingly in this assay  -lariciresinol was able to confirm its bactericidal effect against both the tested pathogens S. aureus KCTC1621 and E. coli O157H7 as confirmed by the marked release of free K ions from the treated bacterial cells as compared to non-treated cells used as a control .The  -lariciresinol at MIC allowed the K ion release of 150-700 mmolL and 100-650 mmolL against S. aureus KCTC1621 and E. coli O157H7 respectively .Release of 260 nm Absorbing Cellular MaterialsIn this assay we determined the release of 260-nm absorbing materials from the bacterial cells when treated with  - lariciresinol at MIC.

Furthermore -lariciresinol at MIC showed reduction in bacterial cell viabilities efflux of potassium K ions and release of 260 nm materials against E. coli O157H7 and S. aureus KCTC1621.

Moreover deteriorated cell wall morphology of E. coli O157H7 and S. aureus KCTC1621 cells treated with -lariciresinol at MIC further confirmed its inhibitory effect against the tested pathogens suggesting it to be an alternative means of antimicrobials.Keywords antimicrobial effect Rubia philippinensis  -lariciresinol foodborne pathogens scanning electron microscopyINTRODUCTIONFood industry and regulatory authorities are more concerned about the safety of food and its contamination by foodborne pathogenic bacteria  .
