Particularly microbiome-triggered changes in intes- tine tight-junction proteins and alkaline phosphatase activity in the gut milieus may increase gut permeability and lead to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance In obese individuals T2DM pathogenesis is linked to activation of inflammatory pathways that cause insulin resistance through activation of the IkB kinase complex protein kinases 1 and 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases JNKs in the tissues In brief the predominant notion of T2DM pathogenesis incor- porates a nexus of microbial dysbiosis gut leakiness autoim- munity chronic inflammation of adipose tissue obesity and insulin resistance Microbial dysbiosis associated with T2DM is charac- terized by poor species richness and diversity Table Quite a few studies reported changes in the abundance of certain bacterial clades in diabetic conditions such as a change in the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio Correction of microbial dysbiosis by supplementation with prebiotics as reported by Cani et al.

The exact mode of action of this drug is not well defined though it has been shown that the drug improves gut microbial diver- sity metalloproteins-encoding gene expression in gut bacte- rial species and glycemic index The gut microbiome interacts with host genetics and encodes several essential proteins required for human health and disease Xu and Gordon suggested that microbes can modify gene expression in the host to create physiological homeostasis or to elicit certain disease patho- genesis.

Perhaps based on the available literature it can be concluded that changes in the microbiome may have sub- stantial effects on host metabolism  Any significant change in bacterial diversity may affect the gut fermentation profile gut wall permeability and mucosal and systemic immunity and therefore may trigger mechanisms responsi- ble for oxidative stress endotoxemia obesity and hypergly- cemia While many reports have shown changes in the ratio of the predominant phyla in the gut the question remains as to the functional effects of such constituents and if this are clinically significant.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.ReferencesA.

It is thought that in hereditarily prone persons a chronic inflammatory disease of the GIT elicits the primary offense leading to autoimmune destruction of b-islet cells Recent research has highlighted the role of the GIT microbiome in the development of T1DM and that the disease is associated with unidentified GIT microbiome dysbiosis Brown et al.

In the first concept as mentioned above microbiome dysbiosis-associated immune regulation may lead to T cell-mediated destruction of beta cells in genetically susceptible individuals The second proposed pathogenesis correlates T1DM with gut leakiness endotoxemia and immune-deregulation-associated chronic low-grade inflammation Some bacterial species such as Akkermansia muciniphila Bacteroidetes thetaiotaomicron and E. coli enhance gut permeability and endotoxemia which may lead to metabolic syndrome Through earlier experiments it is widely recognized that oxidative stress plays a major role in the development of dia- betes.

Among the environmental factors the GIT microbiome has gained much interest based in part on experimentation in human diabetic subjects and nonobese diabetic NOD mice or biobreed diabetes rodent models Studies with the germ-free model of NOD mice reported enhanced suscepti- bility to autoimmune and allergic diseases and spontaneous development of diabetes In brief accumulated evi- dences suggest a prominent role of microbiome in diabetes autoimmunity and other metabolic diseases.

The present article therefore is designed to delineate the significance of GIT microbiome in the pathophysiology of diabetes and how management of microbiome can relieve the patient.Role of GIT Microbiome in Host Metabolism and Energy HomeostasisHosts and their microbiomes develop symbiotic relation- ships through interactive evolutionary processes that mutu- ally benefit both.

Although the aforementioned literature enhances our understanding of the role of the microbiome in host metabolism and energy homeostasis the identification of better molecular markers of metabolism regulation is of greater significance.GIT Microbiome and Metabolic Disorders as Precursors to DiabetesThe gastrointestinal tract microbiome interacts with host nutrition the environment and host genetics for the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders.

Transient changes in the microbiome can disrupt the microbiome and host-immune axis.

However there is still a scarcity of scientific literature that connects such alterations in the microbiome as a predictor of its functional role in the disease pathology Table The available literature suggests that there might be more than one coincident or independent pathogenesis route through which the GIT microbiome can lead to beta cell destruction and the onset of T1DM.
