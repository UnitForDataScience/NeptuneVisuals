it is thought that in hereditarily prone persons a chronic inflammatory disease of the git elicits the primary offense leading to autoimmune destruction of b-islet cells recent research has highlighted the role of the git microbiome in the development of t1dm and that the disease is associated with unidentified git microbiome dysbiosis brown et al.

the present article therefore is designed to delineate the significance of git microbiome in the pathophysiology of diabetes and how management of microbiome can relieve the patient.role of git microbiome in host metabolism and energy homeostasishosts and their microbiomes develop symbiotic relation- ships through interactive evolutionary processes that mutu- ally benefit both.

although the aforementioned literature enhances our understanding of the role of the microbiome in host metabolism and energy homeostasis the identification of better molecular markers of metabolism regulation is of greater significance.git microbiome and metabolic disorders as precursors to diabetesthe gastrointestinal tract microbiome interacts with host nutrition the environment and host genetics for the development of obesity-related metabolic disorders.

among the environmental factors the git microbiome has gained much interest based in part on experimentation in human diabetic subjects and nonobese diabetic nod mice or biobreed diabetes rodent models studies with the germ-free model of nod mice reported enhanced suscepti- bility to autoimmune and allergic diseases and spontaneous development of diabetes in brief accumulated evi- dences suggest a prominent role of microbiome in diabetes autoimmunity and other metabolic diseases.

transient changes in the microbiome can disrupt the microbiome and host-immune axis.

however there is still a scarcity of scientific literature that connects such alterations in the microbiome as a predictor of its functional role in the disease pathology table the available literature suggests that there might be more than one coincident or independent pathogenesis route through which the git microbiome can lead to beta cell destruction and the onset of t1dm.
