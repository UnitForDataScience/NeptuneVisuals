second it has been indicated that transplantation of gut mi- crobiota from obese humans with metabolic abnormalities in- to germ-free mice results in the development of obesity and metabolic abnormalities in the mice .

therefore we may have succeeded for the first time in identifying specific dietary ingredients that cause the metabolic syndrome even in the absence of excessive intake of energy.in summary we were able to demonstrate that long-term dietary nitritenitrate deficiency gave rise to the metabolic syndrome endothelial dysfunction and eventually cardiovas- cular death in mice indicating a novel pathogenetic role of the exogenous no production system in the metabolic syndrome and its vascular complications.funding this work was supported in part by grant-in-aids for research activity start-up 15h06519 and scientific research c 16k09519 from the japan society for the promotion of science special account budgets for education and research granted by the japan ministry of education and grants from the okinawa medical science research foundation the ryukyu university support foundation the promotion project of medical clustering of okinawa prefecture the okinawa prefecture for promotion of advanced medicine and the university of the ryukyus japan.duality of interest the authors declare that there is no duality of inter- est associated with this manuscript.data availability the datasets generated during andor analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reason- able request.contribution statement mk-t. and ms designed the study acquired analysed and interpreted data and drafted the article.

in this study we employed a low-nitritenitrate chow in which the contents of those ingredients were identical with the regular chow.we previously bred mice in which all three nos iso- forms were completely disrupted triply nienoss-- mice  and indicated that both their plasma nitrite nitrate concentrations and urinary nitritenitrate excretion were extremely low at less than 10 of the normal levels of wt mice .

conclusionsinterpretation these results provide the first ev- idence that long-term dietary nitritenitrate deficiency gives rise to the metabolic syndrome endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular death in mice indicating a novel pathogenetic role of the exogenous no production system in the metabolic syndrome and its vascular complications.keywords acute myocardial infarction .

the metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in industrial countries worldwide and it has been reported that in accordance with the most recent harmonised definition of the metabolic syndrome 23 of the adult population 20 years of age in the usa suffered from the metabolic syndrome in 2009-2010  .

bacteroides uniformis cect 7771 which might improve the metabolic syndrome  was not detected in either diet.an 18 month lnd resulted in more severe metabolic syn- drome and endothelial dysfunction although the metabolic effects of the lnd appeared to reach a plateau at 3 months we explored the effects of an extremely long period of lnd 18 months for confirmation.

as it has been reported that inflammation enos downregulation and adiponectin insufficiency contribute to the occurrence and progression of the metabolic syndrome - it is possible that those factors were involved in the development of the metabolic syndrome induced by the lnd.the following lines of evidence suggest a causal role of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the development of the metabolic syndrome.

it has been reported that cardiac and hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury in mice - cardiac allograft rejection in rats  and platelet aggregation in mice  are exacerbated by a low- nitritenitrate diet lnd a commercially available low-nitrite nitrate chow plus potable ultrapure water or the low-nitrite nitrate chow alone compared with a regular diet rd.

we randomly assigned the mice to diet groups and either the low-nitritenitrate chow plus ultrapure water lnd or the regular chow plus tap water rd was fed ad libitum to the mice from 6 weeks of age for 1.5-22 months see esm methods.nitrite and nitrate levels the nitrite and nitrate contents of the chows were analysed using the diazotisation method and the cadmium reduction-diazotisation method respectively japan food research laboratories tokyo japan.

during the 22 months of follow-up none 024 of the rd-fed mice but 31.8 722 of the lnd-fed mice died.

however contrary to these suggestions another study showed that a 1 week lnd compared with an rd mark- edly decreased plasma nitritenitrate levels in wt mice showing normal nos activities  however the possible underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified.in this study we obtained a similar finding in that 1.5-4.5 months of the lnd markedly reduced plasma nitrite nitrate levels in wt mice.

thus there may be a vicious cycle of adiponectin insufficiency and enos downreg- ulation and this vicious cycle may contribute to the markedly diminished plasma nitritenitrate levels induced by the lnd.the levels of ppar-g total ampk and p-ampk were significantly lower in the ewat in the 1 week lnd-fed mice compared with the rd-fed mice.

as it has been reported that ppar-g and ampk increase levels of adiponectin levels in adipocytes   it is conceivable that reduced ppar-g and ampk in the visceral fat were involved in the adiponectin insufficiency induced by the lnd.the 3 month lnd-fed mice exhibited visceral obesity with adipocyte hypertrophy hyper-ldl-cholesterolaemia and hyper-small dense ldl-cholesterolaemia and glucose intoler- ance and the 18 month lnd-fed mice manifested body weight gain hypertension insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.

thus before 18 months the effects of lnd on glucose tolerance could be due to the result of those on pancreatic beta cell function.table 4 serum levels of 23 inflammatory markers in mice fed the rd and lnd for 1.5 monthsn  8-10 mice for each groupsf granulocyte-colony stimulating factor gm-csf granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor kc keratinocyte-derived chemo- kine mcp monocyte chemotactic protein mip macrophage inflamma- tory protein rantes regulated on activation normal cell expressed and secreteda clustering of cardiovascular risk factors i.e.

whereas it has been reported that high-fat diet- fed c57bl6j mice showed glucose intolerance compared with their rd-fed counterparts whether they were tested under conscious or anesthetised conditions  it has also been indicated that the use of anaesthesia could influence glucose tolerance in c57bl6j mice .
