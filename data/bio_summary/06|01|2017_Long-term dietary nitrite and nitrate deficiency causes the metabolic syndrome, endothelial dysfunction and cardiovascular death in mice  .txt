However contrary to these suggestions another study showed that a 1 week LND compared with an RD mark- edly decreased plasma nitritenitrate levels in WT mice showing normal NOS activities  however the possible underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified.In this study we obtained a similar finding in that 1.5-4.5 months of the LND markedly reduced plasma nitrite nitrate levels in WT mice.

Thus there may be a vicious cycle of adiponectin insufficiency and eNOS downreg- ulation and this vicious cycle may contribute to the markedly diminished plasma nitritenitrate levels induced by the LND.The levels of PPAR-g total AMPK and p-AMPK were significantly lower in the EWAT in the 1 week LND-fed mice compared with the RD-fed mice.

As it has been reported that PPAR-g and AMPK increase levels of adiponectin levels in adipocytes   it is conceivable that reduced PPAR-g and AMPK in the visceral fat were involved in the adiponectin insufficiency induced by the LND.The 3 month LND-fed mice exhibited visceral obesity with adipocyte hypertrophy hyper-LDL-cholesterolaemia and hyper-small dense LDL-cholesterolaemia and glucose intoler- ance and the 18 month LND-fed mice manifested body weight gain hypertension insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.

In this study we employed a low-nitritenitrate chow in which the contents of those ingredients were identical with the regular chow.We previously bred mice in which all three NOS iso- forms were completely disrupted triply nieNOSs-- mice  and indicated that both their plasma nitrite nitrate concentrations and urinary nitritenitrate excretion were extremely low at less than 10 of the normal levels of WT mice .

Therefore the use of anaes- thesia could be a limitation of this study.An increased number of inflammatory foci decreased eNOS levels and lower adiponectin levels were noted in the visceral fat of the LND-fed mice and improvements in the LND-induced metabolic syndrome by nitrate supplementation were linked to ameliorations of these changes.

We randomly assigned the mice to diet groups and either the low-nitritenitrate chow plus ultrapure water LND or the regular chow plus tap water RD was fed ad libitum to the mice from 6 weeks of age for 1.5-22 months see ESM Methods.Nitrite and nitrate levels The nitrite and nitrate contents of the chows were analysed using the diazotisation method and the cadmium reduction-diazotisation method respectively Japan Food Research Laboratories Tokyo Japan.

Thus before 18 months the effects of LND on glucose tolerance could be due to the result of those on pancreatic beta cell function.Table 4 Serum levels of 23 inflammatory markers in mice fed the RD and LND for 1.5 monthsn  8-10 mice for each groupSF granulocyte-colony stimulating factor GM-CSF granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor KC keratinocyte-derived chemo- kine MCP monocyte chemotactic protein MIP macrophage inflamma- tory protein RANTES regulated on activation normal cell expressed and secretedA clustering of cardiovascular risk factors i.e.
