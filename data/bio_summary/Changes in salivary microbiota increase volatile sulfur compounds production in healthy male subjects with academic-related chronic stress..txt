The in vitro experiment demonstrated that S. moorei increased H2S production by F. nucleatum p  0.05 ANOVA and Tukey's test.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.ConclusionThe increased amount of S. moorei in saliva and its coexistence with F. nucleatum and T. forsythia seemed to be responsible for increased oral hydrogen sulfide in the healthy male stressed subjects.IntroductionHalitosis can be a physiological andor a pathological condition .

The protocol was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modification of the lysis time Proteinase K and PurelinkTM Genomic LysisBinding Buffer step which was changed to 2 h. The final elution was made using 25 mL of elution buffer.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the rela- tionships among the quantity of bacteria in saliva oral emanation of VSCs and academic- related chronic stress in healthy male subjects.Materials and methodsClinical studyExperimental design.

The volunteers were classified as either Stressed n  21 or Not stressed n  57 using psychometric behavior analysis Maslach Burnout Inventory Student Survey questionnaire MBI-SS a validated tool for determination of a state of academic-related chronic stress.

The influence of academic stress on gingival inflamma- tion.

Some studies have demonstrated that stress-related substances can affect the growth of several periodontopathogens  upregulate the expression of virulence and oxidative stress genes in P. gingivalis  and increase H2S and CH3SH production by F. nucleatum .Therefore we hypothesized that the alteration of saliva composition by academic-related chronic stress could create a favorable environment for bacterial VSCs production resulting in increases of VSCs in these subjects.

Since burnout syndrome is directly related to the perceived chronic stress  we assumed that chronic stress was the distinguishing factor between the groups in this study with the Stressed group presenting higher amounts of H2S in the oral cavity.
