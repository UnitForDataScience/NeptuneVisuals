CDI is often a sequela of broad-spectrum antibiotics which have consider- able activity against protective commensals leading to large shifts in the intestinal microbiome.53Asymptomatic patients with hematologic malignancies prior to allogeneic HSCT have been shown to have a C difficile colonization rate ranging from 8 to 29 with approximately 12 colonized with a toxigenic strain.5154 In contrast C difficile colonization rate is much lower in the general population5556 and only approximately 8 colon- ized with the toxigenic strain.57CDI in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT was not associ- ated with any increased risk of mortality.52 There are several reported risk factors for the incidence of CDI following allogeneic HSCT includ- ing carbapenem use58 previous C difficile colonization51 CDI within nine months before allogeneic HSCT52 total body irradiation cord blood transplant and onset of acute GVHD up to one year after alloge- neic HSCT.48 Matched-related donor transplants were associated with a lower incidence of peri-transplant CDI.52 In this study CDI was found to occur much earlier and in nearly 40 of patients if there was con- firmed CDI within the preceding nine months prior to allogeneic HSCT52 raising the question of whether these patients might benefit from prophylactic metronidazole or oral vancomycin during the high- risk periods early after allogeneic HSCT.Based on the multidirectional interactions between intestinal microbiota mucosal inflammation and GVHD Figure 1 the associa- tion between CDI and the development of intestinal GVHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT5960 is not surprising.

Therefore the interaction between the Lactobacillales and intestinal inflammation appeared to be bidirectional.Furthermore human studies of the loss of diversity of the intestinal microbiome after allogeneic HSCT found the correlation betweenreduced Blautia genus and a decreased incidence of acute GVHD and overall mortality.21 Expansion of Enterococci has also been shown to predict an increased risk of GVHD19 although a subsequent study could not replicate the finding.21 Interactions between intestinal microbiota and inflammatory cytokines during allogeneic HSCTVarious laboratory observations1819 highlight the complex and multi- directional interplay between inflammation microbiota and immune reactivity in the intestine following allogeneic HSCT Figure 1.

In vitro data on the effect of probiotics onFIGURE 2 Mechanisms of action of prebiotics and SCFAs in modulating mucosal damage Color figure can be viewed at human intestinal tissue have shown immunomodulation of intestinal tissue dendritic cells to produce IL-10 decrease interferon gamma release by intestinal T-cells and decreased lipopolysaccharide LPS- induced production of the proinflammatory IL-12.43 A murine study showed a protective effect of the probiotics on the development of GVHD and improved overall mortality when given a prominent species of Lactobacillus.44Human studies investigating the effect of probiotics in patients undergoing allogeneic detailing probiotic fungemia and bacteremia in patients that were taking or given probiotic formulations including patients who were immunocompromised by processes other than mye- loablation andor immunosuppressive medications eg human immuno- virus critical illness.4546 However a study involving 31 pediatric and adolescent undergoing allogeneic HSCT patients found that administra- tion of Lactobacillus day-7 during the conditioning regimen through day 114 did not result in Lactobacillus bacteremia although the study also did not find any significant difference in the incidence of GVHD.47 Another study is currently ongoing on the use of the probiotic L rhamno- sus GG in patients who have attained a hematologic recovery following allogeneic HSCT to evaluate the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD in conjunction with fecal analysis of the microbiome duration of immunosuppressive therapy and infection as well as measurement of numerous inflammatory mediators eg IL-2 IL-6 IL-8 IL-10 TNF-alpha conventional T cells regulatory T cells B cells and natural killer cells and known biomarkers associated with GVHD NCT02144701.

INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS AND ALLOGENEIC HSCT Intestinal microbiota and GVHDEarly investigations into the role of microbiota following allogeneic HSCT demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality and acute GVHD in mice transplanted in a germ-free environment.1112 A decade later a human trial involving patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT122  VC 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc.wileyonlinelibrary.comjournalajhAm J Hematol.

Using this molecular technique it was found that although the intestinal flora diversity in patients with hematologic malignancy prior to allogeneic HSCT was similar to that in the healthy population1819 a loss of the diversity occurred after allogeneic HSCT even before the development of any GVHD.

The progressive move away from the routine use of parenteral feeding in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT could also explain the discrepancies of results in various studies of intestinal decontamination following allogeneic HSCT.13-15The beneficial effects of enteral feeding may be related to the pre- biotic properties of fiber from select fruits and vegetables.33 Prebiotics are indigestible carbohydrate that is fermented by colonic flora or com- mensals to produce short chain fatty acids SCFAs such as butyrate acetate and propionate that are utilized as an energy source by and promote the health of the human enterocyte.34 Some of these SCFAs are pivotal in anti-inflammatory pathways through the induction of reg- ulatory T-cells which produce anti-inflammatory cytokines eg IL-10that may modulate the incidence and severity of GVHD Figure 2.35-37 Butyrate a SCFA promotes intestinal barrier function increases trans- epithelial electrical resistance and decreases inulin permeability.3839 Reduced levels of butyrate occurred in mucosal tissue following alloge- neic HSCT and were associated with decreased histone acetylation and increased enterocyte apoptosis.39 Restoration with local administration of exogenous butyrate restored enterocyte junctional integrity reduced apoptosis and mitigated GVHD.

It has a known role in refractory or relapsed CDI.65 No other disease currently has FDA approved use of FMT.Extending this therapy to allogeneic HSCT patients has been met with concerns of bacteremia and other associated infections which have been reported in immunocompetent patients.6667 However FMT has been successfully and safely carried out in patients who developed refrac- tory CDI following allogeneic HSCT.68 Six of the seven patients experi- enced long periods of remission of the CDI.

Another study reported the successful use of repeated FMT in three patients who developed intestinal GVHD following allogeneic HSCT.70 Obviously these results need to be confirmed in larger studies.FMT has also been reported to also reduce intestinal colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in patients with hematologic malig- nancies.71 It would therefore be of great interest to extend such an investigation to patients with a history of colonization with antibiotic- resistant bacteria prior to undergoing allogeneic HSCT to reduce the risk for the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.There are currently a number of studies ongoing to investigate the role of FMT in preventing intestinal GVHD following allo-HSCT.

Fecal microbiota transplant FMT that restores normal intestinal microbiota and results in long lasting remission in these patients provides additional supportfor this notion.5 Dysbiosis has also been implicated in the pathophysiol- ogy of colorectal cancer multiple sclerosis diabetes mellitus obesity and allergies.6-10Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant HSCT are at very high risks for many infectious and inflammatory complica- tions because of their underlying malignancies and extensive exposure to systemic antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents that render them particularly vulnerable to major shifts in the intestinal microbiome.
