as anaerobic glycolysis does not consume oxygen the posi- tive effect of butyrate -- mediated by pparg signalling -- on the limitation of oxygen bioavailability was lost...generating a state of hypoxia that limits the expansion of facultative anaerobic bacteriaa healthy gut microbiota is charac- terized by a dominance of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla that prevent the expansion of facultative aerobic and potentially pathogenic members of the enterobacteriaceae familyin part by limiting the production of oxygen and nitrate by the host.

found that the peroxisome prolifer- ator-activated receptor-g pparg was activated by the gut microbiota as a homeostatic pathway to prevent the dysbiotic expansion of members of the enterobacteriaceae in the gut and that its activation limited the availability of nitrate and oxygen.in particular in an intestinal epithelial model the authors showed that butyrate produced by the gut microbiota was responsible for the decreased production of nitrate the catabolic product of nitric oxidein the intestinal lumen and that butyrate was sensed by the host by the nuclear receptorpparg.

indeed b-oxidation of butyrate is known to drive energy metabolism in colonic epithelialcells and to consume large amounts of oxygen thus generating a state of hypoxia that limits the expansion of facultative anaerobic bacteria.indeed the authors showed that the depletion of butyrate caused by antibiotic treatment inducedunder these conditions and the expansion of facultative anaerobic bacteria was shown to be favoured.however decreased pparg sig- nalling was found to be a necessary but insufficient condition to increase oxygen availability in the gut.

therefore when these metabolites are lacking t cells are not stimulated and mucosal inflammation increases which in turn contributes to the increase in oxygen bioavailability in colonic epithelial cells.in summary this study describes a new molecular mechanism used by the gut microbiota to maintain a state of homeostasis in the intestinal lumen and highlights the impor- tance of pparg signalling in this complex regulation.irene vaccaphilip patenallmacmillan publishers limitednature reviews  microbiology

in addition by combining antibiotic treatment and pharmacological treatments aimedat activating or blocking epithelial pparg signalling they were able to specifically examine and confirm the role of this receptor in the regulation of nitric oxide synthesis and down- stream nitrate production.

in accordance with this overstimulation of this receptor by a specific agonist repressed the synthe- sis of inducible nitric oxide synthase inos and consequent nitrate production thereby mimicking the effects of butyrate.next the authors confirmed these results in mice and showed that the depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria by antibiotic treatment increased the bioavailability of nitrate in the gut.

in particular the depletion of the gut microbiota through anti- biotic treatment caused a decreasein not only butyrate but also other microbial metabolites that signal through various host immune cell receptors.

to exclude the possibility that their resultswere caused by off-target effects of pharmacological treatments they confirmed their results in a knockout mouse model for pparg signalling.pparg signalling was also found to be important for limiting the bio- availability of oxygen in the intestinal epithelium.

among them were short- chain fatty acids that are respon- sible for inducing an expansion of colonic regulatory t cells which limit pro-inflammatory responses.

indeed inflammation contributed to the increase in oxygenation in colonic epithelial cells and consequent dysbiosis.

however the molecular mecha- nisms that underlie this regulation and trigger host signalling were unknown.a recent study by byndloss et al.
