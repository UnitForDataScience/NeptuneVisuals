with inoculation studies we demonstrate that a. rhizophila is non-pathogenic asymptomatically colonizes plant roots and appears to foster plant-growth and elevated photosynthesis rates.key words basidiomycete root endophyte sterile mycelium plant microbiomeintroductionplant mycobiomes consist of diverse communities of fungi that live on and within plant tissues .

intensive efforts to isolate fungi from the populus root microbiome has resulted in a large collection of isolates 2000 from p. deltoides in the eastern11 801213 81141516171819202122 84232425 8526272829303132 883334 8935363738394041 924243 934445 9446this novel taxon as atractiella rhizophila and we characterize the morphology phylogenetic placement and ecology of this species.materials and methodsisolating fungi from plant rootsfungi used in this study were isolated from root samples collected from adult native populus deltoides growing along the yadkin river nc usa and from p. trichocarpa trees propagated and grown in one of five replicated common garden experimental sites ca usa established through the department of energy bioenergy science center besc .

fungi able to enter grow and persist within plant roots are of particular interest ecologically given their ability to evade plant defense systems.

such endorrhizal fungi may represent a guild of fungi distinct from traditional definitions of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

subsequently this pucciniomycotina otu was detected in high abundance on roots of populus quercus and pinus in trap-plant bioassay experiments using seedlings to bait root-associated fungi from field soils from nativepopulus habitats .

forty-three of these isolates originated from roots and soil bioassays from the besc populus common garden site in placerville ca usa and 15 were obtained from nc along the yadkin river in nc usa.phylogenetic analysesphylogenetic analysis of 18s its and 28s nuc rdna genes classified these isolates in the genus atractiella fig 1. the closest previously described species to our isolates was a. solani however a more closely related undescribed clade was detected among environmentalsequences from soil in china.

for plants that had been inoculated with a. rhizophila there were visually apparent differences in the height leaf area and greenness of the seedlings and sequence data confirmed their presence in plant roots.

atractiella is a genus of three species with pale synnema-like basidiomes terminating with a slimy head of transversely- septate auricularoid basidia producing lateral single-celled hyaline basidiospores oberwinkler and bandoni 1982. here we describe a new species atractiella rhizophila isolated from withinthe roots of populus and pinus plant hosts which confidently can be classified in the genus but11 3081213 3091415 3101617 3111920 3122122 3132324 3142526 3152829 3163031 3173233 3183435 31937 3203940 3214142 3224344 32346 324and their presence is detected through fungal isolations from soils and plants mainly by traditional culturing methods .

to isolate fungi a dissecting microscope was used to observe root tissue and select 2-3 cm sections of healthy roots lacking visible necrosis.

isolates were also incubated with small sterilized branches of spruce pine oak and poplar a technique used successfully to encourage the fruiting of related fungi and incubations were observed over a one-year period.a carbon utilization assay was carried out for the isolate pmi 95 using pre-made biologfilamentous fungi ff microplates 21124 cabot blvd hayward ca containing 95 different11 1541213 1551415 1561617 1571920 1582122 1592324 1602526 1612829 1623031 1633233 1643435 16537 1663940 1674142 1684344 16946 170transmission electron microscopymycelia of pmi 95 was grown on cellophane in mea for five days and then chemically fixed in situ for 15 min with 2.5 glutaraldehyde 2 paraformaldehyde and 0.2mm cacl2 in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer ph 7.2. the mycelium was then gently scraped from the cellophane and placed in a fresh change of the same fixative for 2 h washed 3 x in the same buffer post-fixed in 0.2 m oso4 in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer for 1.5 h followed by 2 washes in buffer and a final wash in water gradual dehydration to 100 ethanol gradual infiltration in spurr's resin spurr 1969 and polymerization for 30 h at 70 c. prior to each step the mycelium was pelleted by brief centrifugation.

in fact numerous studies using culture independent methods have detected sequences of a. rhizophila from roots of woody plants such as poplar oak pine eucalyptus as well as orchids soybean and wild rice .
