Intensive efforts to isolate fungi from the Populus root microbiome has resulted in a large collection of isolates 2000 from P. deltoides in the Eastern11 801213 81141516171819202122 84232425 8526272829303132 883334 8935363738394041 924243 934445 9446this novel taxon as Atractiella rhizophila and we characterize the morphology phylogenetic placement and ecology of this species.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolating fungi from plant rootsFungi used in this study were isolated from root samples collected from adult native Populus deltoides growing along the Yadkin River NC USA and from P. trichocarpa trees propagated and grown in one of five replicated common garden experimental sites CA USA established through the Department of Energy BioEnergy Science Center BESC .

B. Dikaryotic mycelium of A. rhizophila stained with DAPI show two unfused nuclei in each cell of the hyphae.Corn Zea mays roots colonized by A. rhizophila.

With inoculation studies we demonstrate that A. rhizophila is non-pathogenic asymptomatically colonizes plant roots and appears to foster plant-growth and elevated photosynthesis rates.KEY WORDS basidiomycete root endophyte sterile mycelium plant microbiomeINTRODUCTIONPlant mycobiomes consist of diverse communities of fungi that live on and within plant tissues .

Subsequently this Pucciniomycotina OTU was detected in high abundance on roots of Populus Quercus and Pinus in trap-plant bioassay experiments using seedlings to bait root-associated fungi from field soils from nativePopulus habitats .

Such endorrhizal fungi may represent a guild of fungi distinct from traditional definitions of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

For plants that had been inoculated with A. rhizophila there were visually apparent differences in the height leaf area and greenness of the seedlings and sequence data confirmed their presence in plant roots.

With a combination of DNA sequence-based tools and microscopic characterization the taxonomy of A. rhizophila can be formalized and this species can be placed confidently within the fungal phylogeny we can assess its geographic and host range and identify ultrastructure characters.Phylogenetic analyses of our isolates place them within Atractiellales with high bootstrap support for a close relationship to A. solani.
