The effect these soil parameters have on viral communities is therefore probably best explained by the influence they have on host community composition.The effect of sampling site altitude is most probably linked to temperature and water availability and has been previously observed for nematodes at low-altitude DV soils The mean summer temperatures of sur- face soils at low-altitude Dry Valleys elevations below 400 m the coastal thaw zone are typically around 2 degC whereas higher altitude valleys have mean temperatures below 0 degC during the same period -5 degC for the stableupland zone In permafrost soils of the high- altitude University Valley 1700 m above sea level the mean summer temperature of surface soils was -23 degC and no active microbial metabolism could be observed However these soils still contained a highly diverse bacterial community comprised mainly of the phylum Proteobacteria and differing levels of Firmicutes Actino- bacteria and Bacteroidetes The altitude-dependent temperature regime of surface soils directly influences microbial metabolism and is expected to substantially impact viral communities as these require metabolically active hosts for their replication.

These observations suggest that extreme environment communities are vulnerable to disturbance.The microeukaryotic diversity in Antarctic soils is made up of fungi ascomycetes and basidiomycetes chlorophytes ciliates stramenopiles and cercozoans as well as nematodes tardigrades and rotifers in wetter soils As with bacterial diversity a highly variable eukaryote biodiversity has been found related to localized environmental factors In their review on the microbiology of Antarctic Dry Valley soils Cary and colleagues proposed a simple two- tiered trophic model with primary producers e.g.

As such Antarctic soils are excel- lent model environments to investigate microbial interac- tions and ecosystem processes.For bacterial communities spatial heterogeneity in barren Antarctic soils has been found to be high either within the same island  between different Dry Valleys  or over large latitudinal scales .

For example the phyla Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes domi- nate extremely alkaline soils and DeinococcusThermus and Gammaproteobacteria dominate more neutral soils with the relative abundance of acidobacteria inversely correlated with latitude -.

In soils at wetter locations or in transiently wetted soils members of the phylum Cyanobacteria are more abundant  .

cyanobacteria and algae responsible for organic matter input for heterotrophic bacteria and fungi which are then grazed by protozoan and metazoan consumers However this model does not take into account the po- tential role of viruses which have since been shown to be numerous in Antarctic soils It has even been hypothesized that polar regions may be hotspots of mi- crobial evolution due to a higher degree of viral control on these microbial communities In this study we investigated the double-stranded DNA dsDNA viral communities from 14 soils sampled from ice-free areas in the Mackay Glacier region Eastern Antarctica.

This confirms the results of a fingerprinting analysis on similar Antarctic soils where virus com- munities were found to be significantly different over distances as short as 20 m  It is argued that the discrete nature of soil particles and micro-aggregates present in undisturbed soils can lead to resource specialization of microbial communities and can thus lead to greater community diversification at micro- spatial scales The impact of localized environ- mental factors is therefore expected to be greater than general geographical effects as previously observed in temperate soil bacterial communities A comparison was made of the most abundant taxa in these soil viromes with other polar viromes Antarctic and Arctic regions Table The imported soil viromes were the most similar to the soil viromes in this study.The family distribution of Siphoviridae  Myoviridae  Podoviridae  Phycodnaviridae  Mimiviridae was largely conserved except for the virome investigated by GeoChip microarray analysis .

Van Goethem1 Thulani P. Makhalanyane1 Ian Hogg24 and Don A. Cowan1BackgroundThe Antarctic continent is the coldest place on earth with mean annual surface temperatures of -20 degC or less The Mackay Glacier Ross Dependency is a major glacial flow in Eastern Antarctica and is found to the north of the McMurdo Dry Valleys which collectively comprise 15 of the ice-free regions on the continent.
