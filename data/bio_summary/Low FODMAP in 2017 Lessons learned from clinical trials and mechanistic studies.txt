Subsequent retrospective and randomized studies of dietary FODMAP restriction have reported symptomatic improvement in 52-76 of IBS patients.112427-29 Many studies in- volving diet for IBS suffer from placebo effect limited duration lack of rigorous endpoints lack of randomizationblinding and limited dietary assessment to confirm adherence.The results of randomized controlled trials for the low FODMAP diet in IBS patients in IBS patients have not been uniformly positive es- pecially when compared with active interventions in a more real world setting where food was not supplied to subjects.3031 Bohn et al.31FIGURE 1 Mechanisms by which Fermentable Oligo- Di-  Mono- Saccharides and Polyols s may cause Gastrointestinal symptoms.

The authors postulate that degranulation of mast cells may occur due to direct signaling from short chain fatty acids SCFAs or from intestinal distension via fermentation thereby modulating IBSsymptoms.3  EVIDENCE OF CLINICAL BENEFIT There is a growing body of evidence to support the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS symptoms.22-26 The first study demonstrating a link between dietary FODMAPs and symp- toms comes from Shepherd and Gibson's 2008 Australian work dur- ing which IBS patients were more likely to experience gastrointestinal symptoms after blinded consumption of escalating doses of fructose or fructans than after glucose.23 This approach was novel because until this time dietary strategies focused on the elimination of a sin- gle carbohydrate type ie lactose sorbitol fructose rather than entire groups of carbohydrates.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI investigators from the UK showed differ- ential effects of fructose and fructans in the small intestine and colon in healthy volunteers and IBS patients.1516 After fructose and inulin a fructan challenges healthy controls had significantly lower symp- tom scores after either fructose or inulin consumption than patients with IBS despite similar fMRI parameters and breath hydrogen re- sponses.16 Fructose led to increased small-bowel water content in both IBS patients and controls potentially accelerating small-bowel transit and peristalsis as well whereas inulin increased colonic vol- ume and gas via fermentation by resident bacteria.

Given that wheat prod- ucts contain high FODMAP content predominantly fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides GOS studies focusing on non-celiac wheat sensitivity NCWS may be potentially extrapolated to IBS pa- tients.1718 Possible mechanisms for NCWS and thus a response to a low FODMAP diet include increased intestinal permeability of tight junctions or stimulation of lamina propria macrophages leading to pro- inflammatory cytokines.1920 Histamine a signaling molecule known to underlie IBS symptoms may also be affected by the low FODMAP diet.

Our group recently com- pleted the first US comparative effectiveness trial comparing the low FODMAP diet vs usual dietary recommendations in IBS patients with diarrhea IBS-D using a similar study design in 92 patients.30 There was no significant difference between the interventions for the primary endpoint of adequate relief 52 with a low FODMAP diet vs 41 with usual dietary recommendations.

In addition further investigative efforts should be made to determine if the observed changes in the microbiota mitigated by the low FODMAP diet remain once certain FODMAPs are re-introduced to tolerance.One could image a future where it may then be possible to con- struct a less restrictive version of the low FODMAP diet which offers similar clinical benefits to most IBS patients.

Levels of total SCFAs and n-butyric acid both decreased significantly following a low FODMAP diet as compared to baseline but SCFA levels were otherwise not significantly altered when comparing values from samples obtained at baseline fol- lowing a low FODMAP diet and after FOS supplementation.This manuscript from Norway addresses several unanswered ques- tions about the low FODMAP diet.

Given both the concerns about long- term effects of the low FODMAP diet on the microbiota and over- all nutrition as well as the restrictive nature of the diet the full low FODMAP diet is not meant to serve as a long-term solution for pa- tients with IBS.

Unfortunately traditional dietary advice for IBS patients such as regulating fiber intake or fat content is not evidence- based and often has proven ineffective.5-8 Thus the low FODMAP Fermentable Oligo- Di-  Mono-Saccharides and Polyols diet has been gaining popularity for the treatment of this condition.

found no change in SFCA concentration between the low FODMAP diet and a habitual Australian diet33 while others have observed a decrease in SCFA compared to a habitual diet.9In this issue Hustoft et al.9 report the results of a crossover study designed to investigate the importance of fructo-oligosaccharides FOS in symptom generation in IBS patients.
