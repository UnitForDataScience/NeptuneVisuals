as bioavailability embodies the fraction that is actually absorbed by the human body and directly used for physiological functions it could provide more accurate and reliable assessment results.20 the caco-2 cell line has been considered a model for mimicking the absorption process of the human intestinal epithelium21 and in vitro digestion models have been increasingly coupled with differentiated human intestinal caco-2 cells to determine the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of trace elements from food.2223the goals of this study include 1 exploring the bioaccessi- bility of trace elements fe mn cu and zn from diverse veg- etables in the in vitro gastrointestinal environment especially the influence of the human gut microbiota by using a combi- nation of pbet and shime 2 assessing the bioavailability of the trace elements by coupling the in vitro digestion model with the caco-2 cell model and 3 providing scientific rec- ommendations for vegetable consumption.experimental procedureslive subject statementall experiments were approved by the institutional committees of all the participants.

correlation ana- lysis was carried out to analyze the correlation between the bioaccessibility and the bioavailability of the trace elements.results and discussion3.1 total contents of fe mn cu and zn in the vegetablesthe total contents of the trace elements fe mn cu and zn in the vegetables are shown in table 1. the contents ranged from 11.31 to 19.18 mg kg-1 1.02 to 13.02 mg kg-1 0.82 to10.18 mg kg-1 and 3.64 to 11.66 mg kg-1 for fe mn cu and zn respectively.

diversification of diet is hence recommended.4 conclusionsour key findings showed that the human gut microbiota could significantly affect the bioaccessibility of trace elements in veg- etables as they increased the fe extraction from vegetables but reduced the dissolution of mn cu and zn in the colon phase.based on the bioavailability of trace elements the best vege- table sources for fe mn cu and zn were further determined i.e.

referring to the daily reference intakes of trace elements the obtained data provide a scientific basis for both reasonable ingestion of vegetables in diets and diversification of diets.introductiontrace elements such as chromium cr cobalt co copper cu iron fe manganese mn molybdenum mo nickel ni selenium se and zinc zn contribute to some critical functions that maintain health and are hence considered essential for human survival and development.1 both deficient and surplus dietary intake of such trace elements can cause physiological changes and even diseases.1-3 besides each trace element plays a specific role in human health.

reported that in leaf lettuce spinach potato and carrot trace element contents were 6.49 19.72 6.10 and 7.74 mg kg-1 for fe and 2.80 2.33 2.16 and 1.44 mg kg-1 for cu respectively.29 karkoodielement contents varied significantly between vegetable species p  0.001. on a fresh weight basis spinach contained the highest amount of fe p  0.001 which is consistent with the reports that spinach has a uniquely high fe content.31-33 swamp cabbage was found to have the highest content of mn p  0.001 and pak choi had the highest content of cu p  0.001. in terms of zn lettuce edible amaranth and pak choi were the three vegetables containing the highest contents p  0.001.bioaccessibility of fe mn cu and zn in the vegetablesthe bioaccessibility of the trace elements in the vegetables is shown in fig.

relatively high bioaccessibility of the three elements was also reported by other researchers.111230 the findings of this study suggest that the human gut microbiota could decrease mn cu and zn extraction from vegetables and as such the bioaccessibility of mn cu and zn in vegetables could have been greatly overestimated by previous studies.

the concentrations of trace elements fe mn cu and zn in the samples were determined using icp-ms. the operating conditions of icp-ms were as follows1.05 l min-1 for carrier gas rf power of 1300 w 2 degc for an atomizer chamber sampling depth of 7 mm and 0.4 ml min-1 for sample uptake.27 the multi-element solution national institute of metrology china containing 50 mg l-1 of fe mn cu and zn was diluted to prepare the calibration standards with the concentrations of 0 1 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 ug l-1.

different element speciations in vegetables were detected using ion chromatography size exclusion or x-ray absorption spectroscopy including the suspended soluble inorganic and organic species as well as fractions of proteins and poly- saccharides.41 previous studies demonstrated that soluble and inorganic metal salts were more likely to be dissolved than the other speciations42 which could contribute to higher element bioaccessibility.bioavailability of fe mn cu and zn in the vegetablesthe bioavailable contents of the trace elements fe mn cu and zn in the vegetables are presented in table 2 which were in the range of 3.09-22.43 0.02-22.04 not detected- 3.43 and not detected-13.82 respectively.

a significant decrease in the bioaccessibility of mn cu and zn was observed p  0.001 between the small intestine and the colon with reductions of 3.7-89.6 24.8-100.0 and 59.9- 100.0 for mn cu and zn respectively.

there was a significant difference in the bioavailability of the trace elements between the vegetables  p  0.001.a significantly positive correlation was found between the bioaccessibility and the bioavailability of cu r  0.773 p  0.01 and the bioaccessibility and the bioavailability of zn r  0.870 p  0.001. therefore for these two trace elements the difference in the bioavailability between the vegetables shouldbe mainly due to the difference in the bioaccessibility.table 3 the contribution rates of consuming 300 g of a fresh vegetable to meet the daily reference intakes dris of the trace elementscontribution rate of consuming 300 g of a fresh vegetable to meet the dri of the trace element regarding fe and mn there was no significant correlation between bioaccessibility and bioavailability  p  0.05 and thus the difference in the bioavailability between the veg- etables should be attributed not only to the difference in thebioaccessibility but also to the difference in the cellularuptake by caco-2 cells.

to a certain extent this confirmed the val- idity of the methodology of the in vitro digestioncaco-2 cell model for studying the bioavailability of trace elements in vegetables.the bioavailable contents of the trace elements in veg- etables are also shown in table 2. on a fresh weight basis bioavailable fe mn cu and zn were in the range of 61.18-362.28 ug per 100 g 0.20-118.01 ug per 100 g not detected-7.10 ug per 100 g and not detected-111.28 ug per100 g respectively.

therefore zn deficiency can result in multiple diseases such as poor immunity sensory sensitivity and memory deterioration.6 in addition cu and mn are vital to the development of connective tissue and glucose metabolism respectively.7vegetables are an indispensable part of the human diet as well as a primary source of essential trace elements.

it can not only provide guidance on the reason- able ingestion of vegetables for daily dietary and medical treat- ment but also provide input to recommendations on the optimization of the agricultural structure based on the nutri- tional requirements of the consumers.1bioaccessibility represents the fraction of elements that is soluble in the human gastrointestinal environment and acces- sible for further absorption.8 compared with in vivo studies that are time consuming expensive and subject to ethical complications9 in vitro studies have been more broadly carriedout for exploring the oral bioaccessibility of elements and the influencing factors.10-12 the physiologically based extraction test pbet is one of the most pioneering and widely accepted in vitro models which has been applied to assess the bioacces- sibility of trace elements in both the gastric phase and the small intestinal phase.1314 the subsequent colon phase was however ignored.the colon is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and the digestive system which is inhabited by abundant microbial communities.

the digested sample was then diluted with deionized water to a final volume of 25 ml followed by the determination of the total concentrations of the trace elements fe mn cu and zn using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry icp-ms 7500a agilent usa or inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy icp-oes optima 7300 v perkinelmer usa.shimethe shime model developed by van de wiele et al.25 was slightly modified and used to culture the colon microbial community in vitro.
