Relatively high bioaccessibility of the three elements was also reported by other researchers.111230 The findings of this study suggest that the human gut microbiota could decrease Mn Cu and Zn extraction from vegetables and as such the bioaccessibility of Mn Cu and Zn in vegetables could have been greatly overestimated by previous studies.

Diversification of diet is hence recommended.4 ConclusionsOur key findings showed that the human gut microbiota could significantly affect the bioaccessibility of trace elements in veg- etables as they increased the Fe extraction from vegetables but reduced the dissolution of Mn Cu and Zn in the colon phase.Based on the bioavailability of trace elements the best vege- table sources for Fe Mn Cu and Zn were further determined i.e.

As bioavailability embodies the fraction that is actually absorbed by the human body and directly used for physiological functions it could provide more accurate and reliable assessment results.20 The Caco-2 cell line has been considered a model for mimicking the absorption process of the human intestinal epithelium21 and in vitro digestion models have been increasingly coupled with differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells to determine the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of trace elements from food.2223The goals of this study include 1 exploring the bioaccessi- bility of trace elements Fe Mn Cu and Zn from diverse veg- etables in the in vitro gastrointestinal environment especially the influence of the human gut microbiota by using a combi- nation of PBET and SHIME 2 assessing the bioavailability of the trace elements by coupling the in vitro digestion model with the Caco-2 cell model and 3 providing scientific rec- ommendations for vegetable consumption.Experimental proceduresLive subject statementAll experiments were approved by the institutional committees of all the participants.

Correlation ana- lysis was carried out to analyze the correlation between the bioaccessibility and the bioavailability of the trace elements.Results and discussion3.1 Total contents of Fe Mn Cu and Zn in the vegetablesThe total contents of the trace elements Fe Mn Cu and Zn in the vegetables are shown in Table 1.

It can not only provide guidance on the reason- able ingestion of vegetables for daily dietary and medical treat- ment but also provide input to recommendations on the optimization of the agricultural structure based on the nutri- tional requirements of the consumers.1Bioaccessibility represents the fraction of elements that is soluble in the human gastrointestinal environment and acces- sible for further absorption.8 Compared with in vivo studies that are time consuming expensive and subject to ethical complications9 in vitro studies have been more broadly carriedout for exploring the oral bioaccessibility of elements and the influencing factors.10-12 The physiologically based extraction test PBET is one of the most pioneering and widely accepted in vitro models which has been applied to assess the bioacces- sibility of trace elements in both the gastric phase and the small intestinal phase.1314 The subsequent colon phase was however ignored.The colon is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and the digestive system which is inhabited by abundant microbial communities.

Referring to the daily reference intakes of trace elements the obtained data provide a scientific basis for both reasonable ingestion of vegetables in diets and diversification of diets.IntroductionTrace elements such as chromium Cr cobalt Co copper Cu iron Fe manganese Mn molybdenum Mo nickel Ni selenium Se and zinc Zn contribute to some critical functions that maintain health and are hence considered essential for human survival and development.1 Both deficient and surplus dietary intake of such trace elements can cause physiological changes and even diseases.1-3 Besides each trace element plays a specific role in human health.

In terms of Zn lettuce edible amaranth and pak choi were the three vegetables containing the highest contents p  0.001.Bioaccessibility of Fe Mn Cu and Zn in the vegetablesThe bioaccessibility of the trace elements in the vegetables is shown in Fig.

A significant decrease in the bioaccessibility of Mn Cu and Zn was observed p  0.001 between the small intestine and the colon with reductions of 3.7-89.6 24.8-100.0 and 59.9- 100.0 for Mn Cu and Zn respectively.

Different element speciations in vegetables were detected using ion chromatography size exclusion or X-ray absorption spectroscopy including the suspended soluble inorganic and organic species as well as fractions of proteins and poly- saccharides.41 Previous studies demonstrated that soluble and inorganic metal salts were more likely to be dissolved than the other speciations42 which could contribute to higher element bioaccessibility.Bioavailability of Fe Mn Cu and Zn in the vegetablesThe bioavailable contents of the trace elements Fe Mn Cu and Zn in the vegetables are presented in Table 2 which were in the range of 3.09-22.43 0.02-22.04 not detected- 3.43 and not detected-13.82 respectively.
