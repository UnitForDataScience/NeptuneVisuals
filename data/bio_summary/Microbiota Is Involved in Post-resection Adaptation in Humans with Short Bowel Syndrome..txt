2016.It may now be instructive to test whether the microbiota coming from SBS patients that are in demand of energy because of their malabsorption have greater morphogenic potential than microbiota coming from subjects with less malabsorption.Several studies describe an increase in fasting plasma GLP- 1 levels in SBS patients with a jejuno-colonic anastomosis or in resected rats Jeppesen et al.

The D- acidosis is observed only in some patients with a large small bowel resection with a part of the colon in continuity and someAbbreviations SBS short bowel syndrome SCFAs short chain fatty acids Aqp- 3 aquaporin 3 SGLT-1 Sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 PEPT1 proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter MCT1 monocarboxylate transporter 1 SMCT1 sodium- coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 NHE3 Na H exchanger 3.cases are also described in patients with bypass Narula et al.

The classification of SBS patients could be used routinely by clinicians to distinguish patients who never accumulate lactate from those at risk to develop an acidosis crisis.

The microbiota of all patients was dominated by the Lactobacillaceae Figure 1F in accordance with previous results Kaneko et al.

The SBS-microbiota is actively involved in accumulation of fecal lactate susceptibility to D-acidosis and post-resection adaptation.First the accumulation of lactate in feces is dictated by the abundance of lactate producing bacteria in microbiota of patients.

The specific composition and fermentative activity of the microbiota from SBS patients result from the luminal constraints due to the extended resection of the small intestine.The fecal transfer illustrates the adaptability of a specific ecosystem in its environment.

The hypersensitivity to colonic distension of IBS patients can be transferred to rats through their fecal microbiota.

The Figure 3 also indicates that the microbiota from D3 to D30 days was closer to the inoculum than was the microbiota during the2 first days after transfer.

The SBS-derived microbiota after fecal transfer in SBS- H rats triggers crypt deepening and increases proliferation in the colon but this was also observed in CV rats housing a different microbiota.

It may be informative to transfer a microbiota coming from different sub-groups such as NLA or LA or from patients suffering from other malabsorptive syndromes after different types of surgeries.There is a close relationship between the specific composition of SBS microbiota and post-surgery outcome and adaptation.
