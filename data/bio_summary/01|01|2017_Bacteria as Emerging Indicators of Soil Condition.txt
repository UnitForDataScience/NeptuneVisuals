Second which environmental variables correlate with changes in bacterial community composition While we expect to find consistent with other studies that pH has a dominant effect on bacterial communities we also anticipate that we will be able to uncover important relationships between bacterial community structure and other soil variables that are indicators of soil condition.

Furthermore it also suggests that bacterial communities may respond in a somewhat predictable manner to environmental variation brought about by land use change and management indicating that bacterial community data may indeed be a useful tool for assessing the status of the soil at least within the area from which our samples were collected.Consistent with what has been previously reported pH explained the greatest portion of variability in bacterial community composition in our study.

If shown to be reliable microbial community indicators could offer significant advantages over traditional chemical and biological measures in terms of the relative speed and ease of data analysis and of the minimization of site disturbance during sample collection .For bacterial community attributes to be a viable indicator of soil condition it is desirable that natural spatial variations in bacterial community composition be less than the variation caused by anthropogenic factors.

This would be the first step toward supporting the broad-scale use of bacterial data as a viable indicator of soil health.In support of their ability to indicate the condition of the soil environment previous biogeographic studies have identified several variables that correlate with changes in soil bacterial community composition.

The pairing of large-scale surveys of soil bacterial communities to data gathered through long-term soil monitoring programs    provides opportunities to uncover and quantify the strength of relationships between bacterial communities and a much wider range of soil physicochemical variables than had previously been achieved.

This would then define which chemical and physical stresses on the soil environment are reliably portrayed by bacterial communities.To date many studies have assessed changes in bacterial communities only as a whole rather than assessing the responses of individual taxa  .

The absence of studies assessing the responses of important taxa on an individual basis hinders not only our ability to expand our knowledge of the ecological attributes ofthese important community members but also our ability to truly assess the potential of bacterial taxa to serve as biological indicators of ecosystem health.By pairing bacterial community data and extensive metadata gathered from 110 sites we asked three main questions.

First is variation in bacterial communities more strongly related to environmental changes or to the geographic distance separating the communities We predict that soil bacterial communities would be more strongly correlated with soil environmental factors rather than with purely spatial factors.
