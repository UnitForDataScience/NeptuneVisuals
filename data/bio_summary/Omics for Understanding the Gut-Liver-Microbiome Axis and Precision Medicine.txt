pharma- cometabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics are being increasingly used in drug development conducting clin- ical trials studying drug metabolism monitoring pa- tient adherence and compliance to protocols targeting biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic response and safety identifying optimal responders and stratifying patients into treatment arms and other aspects of178clinical pharmacology in drug development 2017 62drug development.1629 pharmacomicrobiomics exam- ines the effect of gut microbiome variations on human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes that regulate drug metabolism by modifying activities and levels of intestinal and liver enzymes and expression of metabolic genes.30 thus the study of interrelationships between the gut microbiome and drug metabolism will ultimately help in tailoring personalized medicine approaches for clinical management of patients with individual characteristics needs and preferences.liver and gut microbial detoxificationdirect blood influx from the gi tract through the por- tal vein makes the liver a critical barrier equipped with a broad array of immune cells and innate immune recep- tors that recognize microorganisms and their microbial- derived products toxins and food antigens that have penetrated the intestinal barrier.31 changes in the com- position of the microbiome or alterations in gut perme- ability can influence the dysbiosis and translocation of microbes into portal circulation which delivers blood directly to the liver.

in addition some microbiome-produced compounds may affect drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics via altered expression of metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters or genes coding for drug target proteins drug response phenotypes and disease states.

microbes can activate or in- activate drugs generate toxic byproducts and alter di- rectly or indirectly drug metabolism by human cells.21the emerging fields of pharmacometabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics are the natural extensions of pharmacogenomics the study of how variations in human genes contribute to individual differences in drug metabolism and effectiveness.22 pharmacoge- nomics is already an integral part of evidence-based medicine that addresses patient risk and variabil- ity including how a person's genome may predict drug efficacytoxicity as well as disease phenotype.23 pharmacogenomics by itself does not study the environmental influences on drug metabolism nor the role of the microbiome on pharmacokinetics absorption distribution metabolism excretion24 andor pharmacodynamics.

liver disease has long been associated with qualitative and quantitative overgrowth dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiome.55 initially clay- ton et al hypothesized that postdose drug metabolism and safety were related to differences in the predose metabolic profile.56 subsequently they showed different levels of pre- and postdose liver toxicity with 2 knownkhalsa et al179hepatotoxins allyl alcohol and galactosamine in rats suggesting that the pharmacometabolomic approach was able to demonstrate the role of the intestinal microbiome in liver pathology.57the predose metabolomic profile of a drug may predict its postdose toxicity or efficacy suggesting environmental influences and the role of the gut microbiome.5859 the gut microbiome can influence an individual's metabolome and thus the drug metabolism and its pharmacologic response.6061 to what extent and how postdose drug metabolites and safety relate to predose metabolites is unknown.

increasing our understanding of the delicate homeostasis between the intestine and its mi- crobes could lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of liver disease and novel therapeutic strategies.acknowledgmentsthe authors gratefully acknowledge the editorial assistance of brian brown division of library services national insti- tutes of health library national institutes of health.declaration of conflicting intereststhe authors whose names are listed as contributing coauthors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any fi- nancial interest in the subject matter or materials dis- cussed in this article.fundingthe authors received no financial support for the pub- lication of this review article.disclaimerthe views in this article are those of the authors and do not reflect the positions of the u.s. department of agriculture and the national institutes of health de- partment of health and human services.parts of this article were presented at the national institute on drug abuse-sponsored meeting on drug- drug interactions and diagnostics for drug users with hiv and hivhcv co-infections june 4-5 2015.referencesbi y qin n yang r et al.

a new emerging perspective of under- standing the effect of the gut microbiome on human response to drugs would be indispensable for developing efficacious safe and cost-effective precision therapies.keywordsgut-liver-metabolic network omics microbiome precision medicine probioticsoverview role of microbiome in gut-liver-metabolic networkthe human microbiome estimated at 100 trillion cells 10-fold the number of human cells encodes 100-fold more unique genes than the human genome.1 the gut microbiome is composed of trillions of bacteria of di- verse taxonomy roughly estimated at 40000 micro- bial species encoding more than 5 million genes.12 the gut microbiome performs functions essential for the de- velopment of the intestinal epithelium immune func- tion health maintenance food processing digestion of complex indigestible polysaccharides and synthesis of vitamins.3 within the gut-liver-metabolic axis com- bined actions of both host genome and multiple gut mi- crobial genomes result in the production of products such as bile acids choline and short-chain fatty acids that are essential for host health.4the liver which is important for the various metabolic and immunologic functions is continu- ally exposed to gut bacterial components includingendotoxins lipopolysaccharide flagellin and lipote- ichoic acid and peptidoglycans.5 hepatic cells such as kupffer cells sinusoidal cells biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes that express innate immune1national institute on drug abuse national institutes of health bethesda md usa2national center for complementary and integrative health nationalinstitutes of health bethesda md usa3national cancer institute national institutes of health bethesda md usa4agricultural research service united states department of agriculturewashington dc usa5formerly national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney dis- eases national institutes of health bethesda mdsubmitted for publication 9 august 2016 accepted 15 september 2016.corresponding authorjag h. khalsa ms phd chief medical consequences branch division of therapeutics and medical consequences national institute on drug abuse national institutes of health dhhs 6001 executive blvd.

the concept of precision medicine may be elucidated by studying genomic and metabolic interactions in the microbiome-gut- liver axis using omics approaches to target 1 or more molecular mechanisms.16 precision medicine overlaps with personalized medicine a similar but older concept that could be misinterpreted to imply that treatments are being developed uniquely for each individual.1718 in precision medicine the focus is on identifying whichapproaches will be effective for a specific patient phe- notype based on genetic environmental and lifestyle factors.1920gut-liver microbiome role in drug metabolism and toxicityhuman metabolic pathways help in understanding the contribution of the gut microbiome to drug metabolism and drug-induced toxicity.

despite the successes clinical pharmacogenomics still needs more validated actionable genomic data that will inform diagnosis prognosis or treatment.25 in the era of precision medicine more rigorously designed clinical research considering these physiologic and environmental factors is needed to demonstrate pharmacodynamic causal associations within standardized architectures for genomic variants.25the metabolome consists of low-molecular-weightmetabolites formed as a result of upstream genomic transcriptomic and proteomic processes.26 pharma- cometabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics predict andor evaluate drug metabolism based on fuller metabolic phenotypes as a result of genetic physi- ological chemical and environmental influences.27 pharmacometabolomics uses high-resolution analyti- cal platforms to characterize the low-molecular-weight composition of biofluids and tissues and can pre- dict drug efficacy and safety.28 it is possible to use metabolomicsmetabonomics to provide fast inex- pensive noninvasive approaches that can assess and predict organ toxicity of lead compounds.

drug-host factors may interact via different functional pathways and determine individual susceptibility clinical phenotype and outcome.62 the cellular injury is drug-specific and may depend on unique properties of the drug and the host response.63 thus to provide precision medicine to patients with hepatic disease researchers may need to consider more carefully stratifying patient's risk factors and potential interactions between the drug and the gut microbiome.omic technologies and gut-liver microbiome considering the interplay among genomic and environ- mental influences such as diet lifestyle polypharmacy toxins gut microbiome and interactions between host-gut metabolomics and the microbiome strategies are needed to handle large complex data.

gut bacterial communities directly metabo- lize certain drugs reducing their bioavailability and influencing individual variation in drug response.

although several mechanisms have been proposed in this process that relies on a balance between the barrier functions of the gut and the detox- ifying capacity of the liver32 the exact mechanisms are unclear and the related cell-specific recognition and in- tracellular signaling events in the liver capable of sens- ing gut-derived microbes need further study.microbial biotransformation of drugs environmen- tal pollutants cosmetics and food components occurs daily and plays a critical role in drug efficacy and tox- icity.
