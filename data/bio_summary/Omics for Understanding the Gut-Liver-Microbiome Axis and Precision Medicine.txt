In addition some microbiome-produced compounds may affect drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics via altered expression of metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters or genes coding for drug target proteins drug response phenotypes and disease states.

Microbes can activate or in- activate drugs generate toxic byproducts and alter di- rectly or indirectly drug metabolism by human cells.21The emerging fields of pharmacometabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics are the natural extensions of pharmacogenomics the study of how variations in human genes contribute to individual differences in drug metabolism and effectiveness.22 Pharmacoge- nomics is already an integral part of evidence-based medicine that addresses patient risk and variabil- ity including how a person's genome may predict drug efficacytoxicity as well as disease phenotype.23 Pharmacogenomics by itself does not study the environmental influences on drug metabolism nor the role of the microbiome on pharmacokinetics absorption distribution metabolism excretion24 andor pharmacodynamics.

Liver disease has long been associated with qualitative and quantitative overgrowth dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiome.55 Initially Clay- ton et al hypothesized that postdose drug metabolism and safety were related to differences in the predose metabolic profile.56 Subsequently they showed different levels of pre- and postdose liver toxicity with 2 knownKhalsa et al179hepatotoxins allyl alcohol and galactosamine in rats suggesting that the pharmacometabolomic approach was able to demonstrate the role of the intestinal microbiome in liver pathology.57The predose metabolomic profile of a drug may predict its postdose toxicity or efficacy suggesting environmental influences and the role of the gut microbiome.5859 The gut microbiome can influence an individual's metabolome and thus the drug metabolism and its pharmacologic response.6061 To what extent and how postdose drug metabolites and safety relate to predose metabolites is unknown.

Pharma- cometabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics are being increasingly used in drug development conducting clin- ical trials studying drug metabolism monitoring pa- tient adherence and compliance to protocols targeting biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic response and safety identifying optimal responders and stratifying patients into treatment arms and other aspects of178Clinical Pharmacology in Drug Development 2017 62drug development.1629 Pharmacomicrobiomics exam- ines the effect of gut microbiome variations on human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes that regulate drug metabolism by modifying activities and levels of intestinal and liver enzymes and expression of metabolic genes.30 Thus the study of interrelationships between the gut microbiome and drug metabolism will ultimately help in tailoring personalized medicine approaches for clinical management of patients with individual characteristics needs and preferences.Liver and Gut Microbial DetoxificationDirect blood influx from the GI tract through the por- tal vein makes the liver a critical barrier equipped with a broad array of immune cells and innate immune recep- tors that recognize microorganisms and their microbial- derived products toxins and food antigens that have penetrated the intestinal barrier.31 Changes in the com- position of the microbiome or alterations in gut perme- ability can influence the dysbiosis and translocation of microbes into portal circulation which delivers blood directly to the liver.

Drug-host factors may interact via different functional pathways and determine individual susceptibility clinical phenotype and outcome.62 The cellular injury is drug-specific and may depend on unique properties of the drug and the host response.63 Thus to provide precision medicine to patients with hepatic disease researchers may need to consider more carefully stratifying patient's risk factors and potential interactions between the drug and the gut microbiome.Omic Technologies and Gut-Liver Microbiome Considering the interplay among genomic and environ- mental influences such as diet lifestyle polypharmacy toxins gut microbiome and interactions between host-gut metabolomics and the microbiome strategies are needed to handle large complex data.

Perturbation in the microbial composition and re- sulting products or changes in barrier function acti- vates the innate immune system via toll-like TLRs and nod-like receptors driving proinflammatory geneexpression thus promoting chronic inflammation in the liver.35-38 The TLRs also play a critical role in microbial translocation across the GI tract39 and hepatic fibrosis Seki et al40 and in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.4142Translocation of microbial products changes in microbiome-mediated energy and inflammation may contribute to the development and progression of liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease ALD non- alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and nonalco- holic steatohepatitis NASH the latter two being the leading cause of chronic liver disease in pediatric and adult populations living in industrialized countries.43-46 Less is known about the role of the gut microbiome in simple steatosis that eventually progresses to cirrho- sis in a subgroup of patients.47 However patients with alcohol dependence may have qualitative and quan- titative changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome48 increased intestinal permeability and al- tered gut-microbial composition.4950 Identifying path- ways linking the microbiome to ALD remains elusive but could be a key to better understanding of underly- ing mechanisms of the gut-liver and gut-brain axes and for designing novel clinical trials.In the presence of gut dysmotility bacterial metabo-lites promote obesity and in particular NAFLD.

Despite the successes clinical pharmacogenomics still needs more validated actionable genomic data that will inform diagnosis prognosis or treatment.25 In the era of precision medicine more rigorously designed clinical research considering these physiologic and environmental factors is needed to demonstrate pharmacodynamic causal associations within standardized architectures for genomic variants.25The metabolome consists of low-molecular-weightmetabolites formed as a result of upstream genomic transcriptomic and proteomic processes.26 Pharma- cometabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics predict andor evaluate drug metabolism based on fuller metabolic phenotypes as a result of genetic physi- ological chemical and environmental influences.27 Pharmacometabolomics uses high-resolution analyti- cal platforms to characterize the low-molecular-weight composition of biofluids and tissues and can pre- dict drug efficacy and safety.28 It is possible to use metabolomicsmetabonomics to provide fast inex- pensive noninvasive approaches that can assess and predict organ toxicity of lead compounds.

Alternatively standards tested multiomic screening tools for selecting individuals according to their suit- ability for treatment with particular drug classes or drug doses are needed.
