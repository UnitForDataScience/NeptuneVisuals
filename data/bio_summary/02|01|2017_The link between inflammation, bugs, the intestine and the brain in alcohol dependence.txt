Studies in animal models and in actively drinking and sober alcoholics should be conducted to determine the activation status of the vagus nerve the possible relationship with systemic inflammation and its potential to influence brain function and behavior in alcoholism.Induction of innate immune genes in the brain participates in the neurobiology of addictionChronic alcohol abuse also activates brain immune cells that results in neuroinflammation and epigenetic changes which could favor addictive behavior.An important question remains whether ethanol a lipophilic molecule that crosses the BBB induces directly an immune response in the brain through its action on neurons microglia and astrocytes or whether peripheral blood cytokines reach the brain to stimulate immune cells of the CNS that in turn produce cytokines.

OPENCitation Transl Psychiatry 2017 7 e1048 doiREVIEWThe link between inflammation bugs the intestine and the brain in alcohol dependenceS Leclercq12 P de Timary1 NM Delzenne2 and P Starkel34INTRODUCTIONAlcohol dependence has traditionally been considered a brain disorder in which the alteration of various neurotransmitters and their receptors in specific areas such as the brain reward circuit plays a major role in the development of the addiction.The neurotransmitter systems implicated include dopamine serotonin opioid peptides glutamate and g-aminobutyric acid GABA which are involved in positive and negative reinforcement processes that participate in the motivation for drug seeking and maintenance of alcohol use after the development of dependence.Pharmacolo- gical approaches that have been developed to treat alcohol use disorders mainly target these neurotransmitter systems 1.

The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the microorganisms and the immune system and recent evidence supports that dis- turbances in the bacterial community result in dysregulation of the immune cells.How can intestinal bacteria communicate with the brain to influence mood and behaviorIn addition to influence host physiology metabolism and immunity accumulating data indicate that the gut microbiota also communicates with CNS and thereby influence brain function and behavior.In line with this assumption GF mice exhibit multiple spontaneous brain changes including hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axisleakyexpression.Intestinal dysbiosis in alcohol dependence.
