studies in animal models and in actively drinking and sober alcoholics should be conducted to determine the activation status of the vagus nerve the possible relationship with systemic inflammation and its potential to influence brain function and behavior in alcoholism.induction of innate immune genes in the brain participates in the neurobiology of addictionchronic alcohol abuse also activates brain immune cells that results in neuroinflammation and epigenetic changes which could favor addictive behavior.an important question remains whether ethanol a lipophilic molecule that crosses the bbb induces directly an immune response in the brain through its action on neurons microglia and astrocytes or whether peripheral blood cytokines reach the brain to stimulate immune cells of the cns that in turn produce cytokines.

opencitation transl psychiatry 2017 7 e1048 doireviewthe link between inflammation bugs the intestine and the brain in alcohol dependences leclercq12 p de timary1 nm delzenne2 and p starkel34introductionalcohol dependence has traditionally been considered a brain disorder in which the alteration of various neurotransmitters and their receptors in specific areas such as the brain reward circuit plays a major role in the development of the addiction.the neurotransmitter systems implicated include dopamine serotonin opioid peptides glutamate and g-aminobutyric acid gaba which are involved in positive and negative reinforcement processes that participate in the motivation for drug seeking and maintenance of alcohol use after the development of dependence.pharmacolo- gical approaches that have been developed to treat alcohol use disorders mainly target these neurotransmitter systems 1. these drugs although somewhat improving the clinical outcomes and relapse rate only display a small effect sizesuggesting the possible involvement of other more peripheral biological processes.over the past few years numerous studies have supported thatinflammation might be important for the development of psychological disorders such as depressionanxietyalcohol cravingas well as cognitive dysfunctionwhich all characterize the pathopsychological facet of alcohol dependence.

the gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the microorganisms and the immune system and recent evidence supports that dis- turbances in the bacterial community result in dysregulation of the immune cells.how can intestinal bacteria communicate with the brain to influence mood and behaviorin addition to influence host physiology metabolism and immunity accumulating data indicate that the gut microbiota also communicates with cns and thereby influence brain function and behavior.in line with this assumption gf mice exhibit multiple spontaneous brain changes including hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axisleakyexpression.intestinal dysbiosis in alcohol dependence.

indeed mutant mice lacking chemokine ccl2mcp-1 or cytokine il-6 genes or their receptors displayed reduced ethanol preference and consumption.by contrast transgenic mice overexpressing il-6 showed increased alcohol preference.in humans increased expression of innate immune genes mcp-1 tlr2 tlr3 tlr4 and high-mobility group box 1 hmgb1 a danger signal exerting cytokine-likeeffects has been shown in the brain of alcoholics collected post- mortem.ethanol exposure could also contribute to the neurobiology of addiction by altering the glutamate signaling through immune mechanisms.in brain slice cultures tnfa has been shown to reduce glutamate transport thereby increasing extracellular glutamate levelsthat lead to an hyperexcitability state which could inactivate the frontal cortex with possible influences on mood and cognition.additional mechanisms potentially involved in gut-to-brain communicationadditional mechanism yet incompletely understood might also be taken into consideration when exploring gut-brain commu- nication 3. for instance intestinal bacteria can synthesize neurotransmitters such as gaba serotonin and dopamine which are important regulators of the brain reward circuit.

intraperitoneal injection of minocycline known to alter neuroim- mune and cytokines expression in the brain was found to reduce ethanol intake but no link with the gut microbiota has been examined in this study.finally in humans the use of antibiotics has been associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety.prospective randomized placebo-controlled well-designed clinical trials are definitely needed to evaluate the effect of modulation of the gut microbiota by pro- orand prebiotics on alcohol dependence and more particularly on the psychological symptoms anxiety depression and craving as well as on the different behavioral aspects of alcohol addiction such as impul- sivity compulsivity alcohol-seeking behavior stress cognitive and executive functions.systemic inflammation as a means of the gut to communicate with the brain in alcohol dependencealcohol-dependent subjects present with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation as witnessed by elevated plasma levels of tnfa interleukin il-1b il-6 il-8 il-10 and hscrp even in the absence of actual bacterial or viral infection.in vivo ethanol is likely not sufficient to induce the peripheral inflammatory response observed in alcoholics as elevated plasma pro- inflammatory cytokines are still found after a period of sobriety suggesting that stimuli other than ethanol might challenge the immune system.

induction of brain cytokines expression and sickness behavior following peripheral adminis- tration of lps has been shown to be mediated by the vagus nerve.afferent vagus nerve endings express receptors to il-1 and prostaglandins and consequently appear to be important for relaying information about the immune status to the brain.

by contrast a recent comprehensive study across multiple laboratories using different animal species and different models of drinking patterns has shown that tlr4 was not a critical determinant of excessive drinking.the involvement of the brain immune system in the modulationof alcohol consumption and addictive behavior has also been shown by studies reporting upregulation of tnfa il-1b il-6 and mcp-1 expression in several brain areas of rodents chronically exposed to ethanol as well as by studies using genetic deletion of immune genes.

finally future studies should be targeted to better analyze the brain inflammatory response in relation with functional changes in the various brain circuits implicated in addiction in humans.

another potential source of inflammation is the gut microbiota a huge community of microorganisms colonizing the intestine that interacts with the host and influence many aspects of physiological processes such as body homeostasis metabolism and immunity.recent evidence suggests the gut microbiota as a new important factor in health and disease including neuropsychiatric disorders.complex pathways invol- ving endocrine immune and neural signaling mediate thecommunication between the intestinal bacteria and the central nervous system cns thereby influencing brain function mood and behavior.changes in the composition of the gut microbiota have been observed in various psychiatric disorders such as autism depression parkinson's disease and alcohol dependenceand interested readers may refer to excellent reviews describing the gut-brain axis and its potent role for mental illnesses.1institute of neuroscience universite catholique de louvain brussels belgium 2louvain drug research institute metabolism and nutrition research group universite catholique de louvain brussels belgium 3institute of experimental and clinical research laboratory of hepato-gastroenterology universite catholique de louvain brussels belgium and 4department of hepato-gastroenterology cliniques universitaires saint-luc brussels belgium.

new potential strategies targeting the gut and not directly the brain will be suggested to improve health and psychological symptoms of alcohol-dependent patients.animal models vs human studies in alcohol researchanimal models have proved very useful in addressing mechanistic questions on the role of inflammation in alcohol dependence and studies on germ-free gf mice have been extremely instrumental in introducing the concept that the gut microbiota may largely influence behavior.

increased blood lps levels in alcoholics have been shown in several studies without however establishing a clear correlation with the severity of the addiction or psychological andor brain modifications.

in experimental models of alcoholic liver disease modulation of the gut microbiota by the use of probiotic lactobacillus gg or dietary fibers reduces gut leakiness endotox- emia inflammation and improves liver function.in humans a 5-day supplementation with probiotics bifidobacterium bifidumand lactobacillus plantarum 8pa3 during alcohol detoxification had greater effect on the reduction of liver enzymes than abstinence aloneand a 4-week administration of lactobacillus casei shirota to alcoholic cirrhosis patients improved the neutrophil phagocytic capacity.although these studies tempt to show a benefit in term of liver disease no data are currently available sustaining a potential benefit of probiotics for brain alterations and psychological symptoms in alcoholics.

however in otherwise healthy subjects previous interventional studies have demonstrated beneficial psychotropic effects of probiotics with improvement of anxiety and depressioncognitive reactivity to sad mood due to reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts stress-associated abdominal symptomsand brain activity.in major depressive disorder patients receiving probiotics improve- ment of depression scores was associated with a reduction of inflammatory biomarker hscrp.the mechanisms underlying the psychotropic effect of probiotics in humans has not yet been elucidated whereas in rodents a strain of lactobacillus has been shown to decrease depression and anxiety-like behaviors through the activation of the vagus nerve.prebiotics are selectively fermented ingredients that result in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus conferring benefits upon host health.they exert their health effects through the production of beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate with antimicrobial activity lower intestinal ph to inhibit pathogen growth such as proteobacteria reinforce the colonic defense barrier and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties.prebiotics might be safer and more efficient than probiotics since they have a broad effect on the gut microbial ecosystem and can change the abundance of 4100 bacterial taxa.faecalibacterium prausnitzii and bifidobacterium which are drastically decreased in alcoholics exhibit anti- inflammatory propertiesand their abundance increased after consumption of prebiotics galacto-oligosaccharides or inulin-type fructans in healthy volunteers and in obese patients.

in rats consumption of prebiotics has been associated with neurochemical changes in the cns with increased hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor and glutamate receptor expressionwhich are involved in the regulation of numerous behaviors including anxietydepression cognitive performance and addiction.antibiotics are another way to modulate the gut microbiota but they have been associated mainly with negative outcomes.

no improvement of endotoxemia or liver function has been shown in alcoholics receiving the broad-spectrum antibiotic paromomycinfor 4 weeks.in rodents depletion of the gut microbiota by antibiotics induced changes in brain neurochemistry and cogni- tive impairmentand importantly modified the behavioral response to a psychostimulant drug.in this latter study oral but not intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics resulted in increased sensitivity to the behavioral effects of cocaine which could be reversed by the administration of short-chain fatty acids.
