Early sensitization to food has been identified as a risk factor for developing allergic airway diseases whereas sensitization to inhalant allergens appears to be more specific to the development of rhinitis and asthma in early childhood .

We sought to evaluate relationships among airway microbiota serum IgE levels allergic sensitization and their relevance to rhinitis and asthma.

Compared with healthy children without mite sensitization the mite-sensitized children with rhinitis and asthma showed significantly lower Chao1 and Shannon indices.

Moraxella and Leptotrichia species were significantly found in the interaction of mite sensitization with rhinitis and asthma respectively.

Although asthma and rhinitis are frequently associated with atopy with pref- erential sensitization to aeroallergens their clinical manifestations present at quite different airway levels.

However few studies have focused on the association between microbiota composition especially in the airways and allergen sensitization and allergic airway diseases such as atopic rhinitis and asthma in early childhood.A detailed understanding of the complexity of airway microbial profiles during early childhood will likely provide much needed clinical insights into this aspect of airway diseases.

Atopic indices including total IgE levels and allergen sensitization to mites and food were significantly higher in children with asthma and rhinitis than in the healthy controls.

However the Chao1 and Shannon indices in the mite-sensitized children with rhinitis and asthma were significantly lower than those in the healthy children without mite sensitization.Beta diversity statistics using the Principal Coordinate Analysis PCoA and non-metric multidimensional scaling NMDS revealed no significant differences in the microbial communities cluster patterns with regard to food IgE sensitization and allergic airway diseases.

Airway micro- organisms associated with mite sensitization for rhinitis and asthma was studied in a linear mixed model for repeated measures.

Microbial profiles identified in the interaction of mite sensitization with rhinitis and asthma.
