Effective net-specific growth rates were deter- mined from the slope of pressure accumulation data plot- ted against fermentation time of 3 x replicate cultures during the phase of exponential gas accumulation.RNA isolation for transcriptome acquisitionRNA was isolated from growing fungal cultures during the exponential growth phase using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen Valencia CA as previously described using the plant and fungi protocol with liquid nitro- gen grinding and on-column DNase Digest .

The total RNA quantity was determined by using Qubit Fluo- rometric Quantitation Qubit New York NY using the high sensitivity RNA reagents.RNA sequencing and transcriptome assemblyRNA was pooled prior to generation of the sequencing library using equal quantities of total RNA from each growth condition.

The large amount of unannotated transcripts reflects a lack of both sequence availability and biochemical knowledge of the anaerobic gut fungi and other primitive clades compared to the higher fungi.The transcriptome of C. churrovis was also aligned and compared to the transcriptomes of the rhizoid-forming fungi Anaeromyces robustus IF 551676 Neocallimastix californiae IF 551675 and Piromyces finnis IF 551677 using a nucleotide blast blastn.

Determi- nation of growth of anaerobic fungi on soluble and cellulosic substrates using a pressure transducer.

Effec- tive net-specific growth rates of 0.050 - 0.002 h-1 and0.063 - 0.008 h-1 were calculated for glucose and fruc- tose respectively while those calculated for polymeric substrates ranged from 0.028 - 0.003 h-1 for growth on reed canary grass to 0.039 - 0.0002 h-1 for growth on corn stover Fig.

.Among soluble sugars the highest overall pressure production was observed during growth on cellobiose 15.37 - 0.42 psig and glucose 15.0 - 0.20 psig with lower pressure observed during growth on fructose 8.93 - 1.1 psig suggesting that greater growth and met- abolic activity occurs on glucose and cellobiose Fig.

This raises the possi- bility that there are differences between the diversity of enzymes employed by rhizoid-forming vs. non-rhizoid- forming fungi andor the mechanisms they use for enzy- matic degradation of lignocellulose.While there is a general lack of genomic information for the Neocallimastigomycota recently five complete genomes and transcriptomes have been published for rhizoid-forming anaerobic fungi--two representatives from the Piromyces genus one each from Anaeromy- ces and Neocallimastix  and one from Orpinomyces recently reclassified as Pecoramyces .

This precludes insight into the enzy- matic machinery of non-rhizoid-forming fungi or the mode of biomass degradation that they favor.Here we describe a novel species of non-rhizoid- forming fungi belonging to the Caecomyces genus iso- lated from the fecal pellets of a Navajo Churro sheep collected in 2015.

While no fungal growth was detected on xylose arabinose and galactose this extra activity may be necessary to break through hemicellu- lose in lieu of the targeted disruption from the rhizoids of the other fungi.

This growth discrepancy may be due to the fact that alfalfa stems formed a gelatinous layer on top of the plant material after autoclaving forming an effective barrier against penetration by non-rhizoid- forming fungi like Caecomyces.
