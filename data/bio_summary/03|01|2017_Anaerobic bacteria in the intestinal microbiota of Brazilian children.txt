The few samples in which this species was detected were collected from child 8 at time point 1 4.83 log10 copiesg of feces from child 15 at time point 2 4.0 log10 copies g of feces and from child 6 at time point 4 7.5 log10 copiesg of feces.

The data revealed that the bacteria population in the gut was highest at the time the delivery.CLINICS 2017723154-160Anaerobic bacteria in Brazilian children's feces Talarico ST et al.Figure 1 - Inter-individual quantification of anaerobic and facultative bacteria in the intestinal microbiota expressed as log10 of16S rRNA copy numberg of feces.

At time point 1 2 days of age and throughout the first year the mean values of total bacteria at each time point did not change significantly and the differ- ences between time points were on the order of 1 log unit Figure 2 Table 2.Bifidobacterium was not detected at some time points for a few children as mentioned previously Figure 1.

These data suggest that known environmental changes 6 cause a decrease in the initial levels of the maternal microbiota and that an infant's microbiota has begun to become established by this time the increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus after the first month of life highlights the fact that breast milk is an important natural promoter of this bacterial genus.The inter-individual analysis showed that in the first days of life microbiota colonization is affected by individual exposure to environmental factors in subsequent months the pattern of anaerobic and facultative genera colonization appears to be mediated by the milk diet with a predomi- nance of Bifidobacterium and with lower abundance Lacto- bacillus supporting global knowledge about the role of dietary milk in infant intestinal colonization 910.Because our previous study detected Escherichia in high abundance in this group of children based on library construction 8 we quantified Escherichia at different time points.

Fecal samples were col- lected at the hospital on the 2nd day after delivery time point1 and by the mother at home on the 7th time point 2 and 30th days time point 3 and at 3 6 and 12 months of age time points 4 5 and 6 respectively.

The maximum 16S rRNA values were detected at time point 1 Figure 2 and then the mean values ranged from 9.75 log10 copiesg of feces on the 7th day to 10.04 log10 copiesg of feces at the 12th month with a minimum value at time point 4 Table 2.

Lactobacillus was detected with low frequency and abundancy and Bifidobac- terium was only detected using qPCR methodology 815.CLINICS 2017723154-160Anaerobic bacteria in Brazilian children's feces Talarico ST et al.qPCR has been widely applied for the quantification of bacterial DNA in different human samples such as feces 22 and human milk 23 due its specificity and accuracy.Brazilian newborns exhibited high relative abundances of Escherichia and Clostridium spp.

These findings may explain the observation that the maximum abundanceCLINICS 2017723154-160Anaerobic bacteria in Brazilian children's feces Talarico ST et al.Table 3 - Quantification of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in feces of infants.112 monthsND13 months7.59212 months7.2413 months10.92312 months9.2413 monthsNA12 monthsND13 months10.2912 monthsNDmonthsNDmonths6.31months7.64812 months9.7313 monthsNA122 days5.7012 months8.44months6.56monthsNA4 months7.546 months6.4412 monthsND15 monthsND12 monthsNA12 monthsND15 months7.08 NA - not available ND - not detectedof Lactobacillus occurred on the second day of life in Brazilian infants followed by a decrease at the seventh day and an increase after one month of age.
