the data revealed that the bacteria population in the gut was highest at the time the delivery.clinics 2017723154-160anaerobic bacteria in brazilian children's feces talarico st et al.figure 1 - inter-individual quantification of anaerobic and facultative bacteria in the intestinal microbiota expressed as log10 of16s rrna copy numberg of feces.

the ability of antibiotic treatment to disturb the microbiota composition including a decrease in bifidobacter- ium abundance has been reported previously 10. although our sample size is limited our results suggested that such changes may also occur in children.however bifidobacterium was the predominant species detected in this group of infants at twelve months of age corroborating the known benefits of breastfeeding as a source of bifidobacterium and its maintenance in the gut mucosa 910. this genus has been described throughout the world as the predominant bacterial group detected in the feces of infants 26-28. our data showed a lower 16s rrna copy number of bifidobacterium after six months of age potentially because of the introduction of new genera of bacteria via solid foods 30.lactobacillus colonization at birth has been attributed to the maternal vaginal flora 31 and possibly to the presence of lactobacillus in the womb environment 32. these findings may explain the observation that the maximum abundanceclinics 2017723154-160anaerobic bacteria in brazilian children's feces talarico st et al.table 3 - quantification of faecalibacterium prausnitzii in feces of infants.112 monthsnd13 months7.59212 months7.2413 months10.92312 months9.2413 monthsna12 monthsnd13 months10.2912 monthsndmonthsndmonths6.31months7.64812 months9.7313 monthsna122 days5.7012 months8.44months6.56monthsna4 months7.546 months6.4412 monthsnd15 monthsnd12 monthsna12 monthsnd15 months7.08 na - not available nd - not detectedof lactobacillus occurred on the second day of life in brazilian infants followed by a decrease at the seventh day and an increase after one month of age.

lactobacillus was detected with low frequency and abundancy and bifidobac- terium was only detected using qpcr methodology 815.clinics 2017723154-160anaerobic bacteria in brazilian children's feces talarico st et al.qpcr has been widely applied for the quantification of bacterial dna in different human samples such as feces 22 and human milk 23 due its specificity and accuracy.brazilian newborns exhibited high relative abundances of escherichia and clostridium spp.

the environmental forces controlling the establishment of the fecal microbiota may favor the maintenance of e. coli in this community 815 as well as in other developing countries 33.prausnitzii is a well-established member of the adult intestinal microbiota with anti-inflammatory properties 13. a few papers have described the presence of this species in children's feces in other populations 283334 but this adult-like bacterium has not been detected in brazilian infants' feces.

during the following months the bacterial load of each studied genera increased with some inter-individual variation.bifidobacterium was undetectable on the second day for children 1 and 15 and on the seventh day for child 8. a predominance of e. coli was observed on the second or seventh day for child 3 child 8 child 12 and child 14. the pediatrician reports for those six children indicated important external factors such as the usage of antibiotics by mother during pregnancy 1 and 12 or by the child at the 7th day 3 or poor sanitary conditions 8 14 and 15.despite some intra-individual variations in the 16s rrna copy number after the 3rd month the microbial pattern was similar for all children with a predominance of bifidobacter- ium followed by e. coli and lactobacillus and the lowest counts of 16s rrna copy number for lactococcus until the end of the first year of age.

the high abun- dance of e. coli suggests a pattern related to unhygienic con- ditions as reported previously in developing countries 34. these results complement analyses of the composition of the gut microbiota in this group of brazilian breastfed infants living in low socio-economic conditions 815 and highlight the influence of both diet and the environment.acknowledgmentsthis work was supported by grants from the sao paulo research foundation fapesp 201151196-7 awarded to crt.anaerobic bacteria in brazilian children's feces talarico st et al.clinics 2017723154-160author contributionstalarico st performed the experiments and participated in data analysis.

the few samples in which this species was detected were collected from child 8 at time point 1 4.83 log10 copiesg of feces from child 15 at time point 2 4.0 log10 copies g of feces and from child 6 at time point 4 7.5 log10 copiesg of feces.

not all requested samples were delivered for children 6 and 16 thus these children were excluded from the individual variation analysis.

the individual results showed a distinct pattern of colonization in the initial days after birth figure 1 with a predominance of bifidobacterium.the bacterial load differed among the children with varia- tions of 3 log units figure 1 and 5 log units for children 7 and 17 in the first days of life.

after 12 months of age none of the children had detectable e. limosum.time point variationthe quantification of the total bacteria at each time point revealed the highest values on the second day of life with levels that were one or two log units higher than the average values figure 2 table 2. at time point 1 2 days of age and throughout the first year the mean values of total bacteria at each time point did not change significantly and the differ- ences between time points were on the order of 1 log unit figure 2 table 2.bifidobacterium was not detected at some time points for a few children as mentioned previously figure 1. of the anaerobic genera evaluated bifidobacterium was present in the greatest numbers at all of the time points tested with maximum values after time point 3 3 months of age.
