express Nfil3 at levels comparable to those of conventionally colonized con- trols indicating that REV-ERBa is required for microbiota-mediated regula- tion of Nfil3 expression.Given the role for the gut microbiota in regulating Nfil3 and Nr1d1 expression Wang and colleagues further examine618 Immunity 47 October 17 2017 a 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.ImmunityPreviewsFigure 1.

Given that expression of select microbial genessuch as those involved in flagellar assem- bly fluctuate dramatically on the basis of the circadian clock  it will be interesting to examine whether rhythmic expression of TLR ligands con- tributes to the circadian cycling of Nfil3 and Nr1d1 expression.

report that germ-free mice also have increased Nr1d1 expression and decreased Nfil3 expression in comparison to conventionally colonized mice.

previously provided evidence that this might apply to NFIL3 in IECs as well when they showed that antibiotic-treated mice have greater Nr1d1 expression and binding repres- sion of NFIL3 in IECs than do conven- tional controls .

Wang and colleagues show that like antibiotic- treated mice germ-free mice exhibit marked reduction of Nfil3 expression when they are compared to convention- ally colonized controls.On the basis of these findings the au- thors examine the important question of whether NFIL3 in IECs is necessary for altering host metabolism and body composition.

Wang and colleagues show that treatment of MyD88-- mice with IL-23 or IL-22 reduces Nr1d1 expres- sion and partially raises Nfil3 expression.

These findings highlight a role for den- dritic cell-ILC3 signaling in regulating Nfil3 and Nr1d1 expression and raise the interesting possibility that other pathways might also contribute.

Consistent with a role for the TLR-MyD88 pathway admin- istration of flagellin or lipopolysaccharide reduces Nr1d1 and increases Nfil3 expression in germ-free mice.

Overall these findings suggest that the sensing of endogenous TLR ligands by host den- dritic cells contributes to homeostatic Nr1d1 and Nfil3 expression in IECs.Wang and colleagues continue down- stream of the dendritic cell-ILC3 circuit wherein IL-22 binds its receptor IL-22R in IECs and induces gene-expression changes via activation of the transcription factor STAT3 signal transducer and acti- vator of transcription 3  .

The authors also reveal that Nfil3 and Nr1d1 expression patterns in Nfil3flflVil1-cre are similar to those seen in microbiota-deficient mice.
