Thus based on the comprehensive comparison of production efficiency incubation time TANFAN level and methanogenic activity between the different acclimation methods it can be concluded that fed-batch could be the acclimation method that will poten- tially supply the necessary ammonia-tolerant bioaugmentation inocula in the near future.ConclusionsThe present study assessed different methods to acclimatise ammonia-tolerant methanogenic consortia and found that fed- batch is the best acclimation method based on the production effi- ciency incubation time TANFAN levels achieved and methano- genic activity.

The thermophilic Fed-batch acclimation method not only had the highest FAN levels and activity but also had more than 40 shorter incubation time compared to batch acclimation methods.

The results derived from the fed-batch acclimation method further proved that adjusting the feeding to an exponential strategy played an important role for a better acclimation process .CSTR reactors performanceBoth CSTR reactors did not pass the second acclimation step 4.56 g NH-N L-1 for mesophilic and 4.32 g NH-N L-1 for ther-44125 and 158 days under stepwise-exposure C and D. This was probably due to the accumulation of lag phases during every single step of the stepwise-exposure.

Before each new ammonia level a small amount 15 mL of sample was taken from the fed-batch reactor for analyses.Specific methanogenic activity testA SMA test on specific substrates formate acetate and H2CO2 was carried out for the final methanogenic consortia derived from the acclimation assays to investigate the combined effect of high ammonia levels and each acclimation process on the methanogenic populations.

However if time is not an issue then it could be possible to use longer HRTs and slower exposure to higher ammonia levels to efficient acclimatise methanogenic inocula as it has been shown before .SMA testActivity test  indicated that hydrogenotrophic methano- gens were significantly more active than aceticlastic methanogens among most of the acclimation methods at higher ammonia levels.

Overall five different ammonia acclimation levels were tested for the mesophilic and four for the thermophilic inoculum respectively .Batch experimental assayTwo subseries of experiments were performed during batch experimental assay.
