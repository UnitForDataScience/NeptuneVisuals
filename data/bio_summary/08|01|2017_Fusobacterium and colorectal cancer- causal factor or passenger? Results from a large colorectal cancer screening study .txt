This is accompanied by increased expression of transcription factors oncogenes Wnt and inflammatory genes as well as growth stimulation of CRC cells.Kostic et al.

This finding along with the positive association of Fusobacterium genus with more advanced tumor stage supports the assumption that Fusobacterium is a passenger bacterium or that it only promotes cancer progres- sion in further advanced colorectal lesions rather than playing a causative role at the onset of carcinogenesis.It would however be conceivable that even in the case that Fusobacterium does not play a causal role in the initiation and early development of CRC it could still be useful as a screeningE.L.Amitay et al.

Another model for the early detection of CRC was sug- gested by Yu et al.

those carrying non-advanced adenoma advanced adenoma or CRC compared with individu- als free of neoplasms in order to provide clues as to a possible role of this bacterium in the development of CRC.

We also assessed the associa- tion of Fusobacterium RA with CRC stage within the CRC group.

The asso- ciations between Fusobacterium RA and sociodemographic nutritional and lifestyle factors were assessed for all participants as well as for the CRC and control groups.Finally the association of Fusobacterium with presence of CRC was analyzed using logistic regression modeling and its predictive ability was estimated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve AUC.

On the other hand we did not observe Fusobacterium genus improving the ability of the age and sex based model to discern between adenomas either advanced or non-advanced and healthy controls Supplementary Figure S1 available at Carcinogenesis Online.DiscussionIn this study we conducted a 16S rRNA gene analysis in fecal samples of 500 participants of screening colonoscopy includ- ing 46 participants diagnosed with CRC 113 with advanced adenoma 110 with non-advanced adenoma and 231 controls free of neoplasms all recruited in a true population-based CRC screening setting.

They reported that Fusobacterium selectively expanded myeloid- derived immune cells that are key components in neoplastic progression and was also associated with a human CRC gene expression signature.On the other hand other studies including the current study found an association of F.nucleatum in feces with colorectal neo- plasms exclusively for CRC but not for colorectal adenomas the precursor of most CRCs .

The researchers found that the combined qPCR measurements of just 2 OTUs butyryl- CoA dehydrogenase from F.nucleatum and rpoB from Parvimonas micra accurately classified CRC samples in a Chinese popula- tion of 47 CRC cases and 109 healthy controls with an improved AUC of 0.84.
