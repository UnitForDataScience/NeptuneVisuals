Studies are still needed to examine how OSA contributes to dysbiosis as well as how dysbiosis is linked to hypertension.Potential Mechanisms Linking OSA to Gut DysbiosisWhile dysbiosis has been demonstrated in animal models of OSA relatively little is known regarding how OSA may induce alterations to the gut microbiota.

Evidence is now emerging that gut dysbiosis plays a causal role in the development of OSA-induced hypertension.Summary In this review we will examine the evidence that gut dysbiosis plays a role in OSA-induced hypertension.

We will discuss potential mechanisms linking OSA to gut dysbiosis examine how gut dysbiosis may be linked to hy- pertension and highlight how this understanding may be uti- lized for the development of future therapeutics.Keywords Obstructive sleep apnea .

These findings sug- gest that this genetic model of hypertension has inherent gut pathologies that may contribute to dysbiosis and hypertension.Our lab recently hypothesized that if gut dysbiosis con- tributes to hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats SHRSP a sub-strain of SHR then transplanting the microbiota of SHRSPs into the normo- tensive WKY strain should induce hypertension .

Sytemic inflammation and altered vascular function due to dysbiosis may contribute to OSA-induced hypertensionA recent study suggests that arousals an important com- ponent in the pathogenesis of OSA contribute to OSA- induced gut dysbiosis Fig.

.With the identification of dysbiosis in multiple models of hy- pertension investigation of the mechanistic links between dysbiosis and hypertension is ongoing.

Additionally there is still considerable work to be done examining how OSA contributes to gut dysbiosis and the underlying mechanisms linking gut dysbiosis to OSA- induced hypertension.

Recent Findings Disruption of the normal composition of the gut microbiota termed dysbiosis has been identified in a number of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases including diabetes obesity and atherosclerosis.

Recently a number of studies have demonstrated gut dysbiosis in various animal models of hypertension as well as in hypertensive patients.

More spe- cifically a number of studies have demonstrated that disrup- tion of the microbiota termed gut dysbiosis is associated with hypertension.
