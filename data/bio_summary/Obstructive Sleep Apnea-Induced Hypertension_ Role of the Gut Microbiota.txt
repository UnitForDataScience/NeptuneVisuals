Studies are still needed to examine how OSA contributes to dysbiosis as well as how dysbiosis is linked to hypertension.Potential Mechanisms Linking OSA to Gut DysbiosisWhile dysbiosis has been demonstrated in animal models of OSA relatively little is known regarding how OSA may induce alterations to the gut microbiota.

Evidence is now emerging that gut dysbiosis plays a causal role in the development of OSA-induced hypertension.Summary In this review we will examine the evidence that gut dysbiosis plays a role in OSA-induced hypertension.

We will discuss potential mechanisms linking OSA to gut dysbiosis examine how gut dysbiosis may be linked to hy- pertension and highlight how this understanding may be uti- lized for the development of future therapeutics.Keywords Obstructive sleep apnea .
