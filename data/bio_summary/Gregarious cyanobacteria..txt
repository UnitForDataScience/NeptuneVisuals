The authors suggested that aggregation might be an inducible defense as a response to the presence of grazers.

The latter have frequently been observed in warm shallow andReceived 23 March 2017 accepted 23 March 2017.

The EPS matrix may absorb and retain metabolites as well as immobilize nutrients and toxins.

The mucilage in which the cells in the aggregate are embedded may also be difficult to digest and certainly represents an inferior food source because it is composed mostly of carbohydrates and is low in other nutrients.

The question addressed by Huber et al.

The most common CPcy morphotype that was present in the plankton was 'Cyanodictyon' and the occurrence of this morphotype correlated with Pcy including the microcolo- nies and short trichomes.

The CPcy which was mostly of the 'Cya- nodictyon' morphotype doubled in size during the 6 days that the experiment lasted.

What causes picocyanobacteria to form aggregates When indeed the formation of the colony is a response on the presence of a grazer how is this grazer sensed Are there infochemicals involved and if so what is their nature who produces them and how are they released and sensed The authors suggest that the colony grows at the expense of Pcy single cells.

The green alga Scenedesmus induces aggregate formation when exposed to grazer-released infochemicals in a dose- response manner Verschoor et al.
