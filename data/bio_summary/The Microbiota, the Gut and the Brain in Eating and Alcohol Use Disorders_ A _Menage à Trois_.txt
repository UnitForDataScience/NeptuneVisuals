Finally a mouse study suggests that manipulations in the gut microbiota may affect cocaine-related behaviors.Conclusions Promising albeit preliminary findings suggest a potential role of the gut microbiota in behavioral correlates of EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders.Short summary Preliminary evidence exists supporting the role of the gut microbiota in eating disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders although additional investigation is needed to determine what is causative versus epiphenomenological.INTRODUCTIONThe gut microbiota is a collection of over 100 trillion microorgan- isms residing in the gastrointestinal tract .

The potential influence of altered gut microbiota dys- biosis on behaviors associated with such disorders may have implications for developing thera- peutic interventions.Methods A systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the gut microbiota EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders was conducted using MEDLINE Embase and Web of Science databases with the objective being to examine the role of the gut microbiota in behav- ioral correlates of these disorders.

Similarly recent research suggests that the gut microbiota may impact behaviors related to problematic alcohol drinking and eating.Notably eating disorders EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders share neurobiological mechanisms that regulate these pathological behaviors and both disorders involve altered reward processing and related neural circuitries  .

EDs and alcohol and sub- stance use disorders present with high mortality and morbidity Table  but limited treatment options  .Recent preclinical studies have shown that the gut microbiota can influence key neural pathways involved in EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders.

Given the shared reward mechanisms associated with EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders and the proven relevance of hormonal signaling in alcohol and substance use disorders   perhaps molecular mimicry plays a role in the pathology of behavioral disorders other than EDs.

Original papers focused on the gut microbiota and potential behavioral implications were deemed eligible for consideration.Results The resulting 12 publications were limited to gut microbiota studies related to EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders.

The studies reviewed above demonstrate that alterations to the gut microbiota in clinical presentations of both ED and AUD have been correlated with altered anxiety and depressive behavior potentially indicating a shared mechanism of influence exerted by the gut microbiota on these behavioral disorders.Although this review facilitates the identification of promising directions for future research the paucity of existing research on the topic of behavioral outcomes associated with EDs and alcohol and substance use disorders is a limitation of this assessment.
