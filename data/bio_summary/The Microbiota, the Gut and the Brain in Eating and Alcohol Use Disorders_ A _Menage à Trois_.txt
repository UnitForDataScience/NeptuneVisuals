the potential influence of altered gut microbiota dys- biosis on behaviors associated with such disorders may have implications for developing thera- peutic interventions.methods a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the gut microbiota eds and alcohol and substance use disorders was conducted using medline embase and web of science databases with the objective being to examine the role of the gut microbiota in behav- ioral correlates of these disorders.

by checking auto-ab levels and sequence homology com- parisons between ed and healthy participants the studiesreviewed support the possibility that gut microbiota-driven dysre- gulation of neuroendocrine control of appetite leads to behavioral profiles associated with food intake in patients with eds.with respect to aud chronic alcohol use induces dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability in only a subset of alcohol depend- ent patients   allowing microbial metabolites to enter peripheral and central circulation and impact behavioral correlates such as alcohol craving  .

similarly recent research suggests that the gut microbiota may impact behaviors related to problematic alcohol drinking and eating.notably eating disorders eds and alcohol and substance use disorders share neurobiological mechanisms that regulate these pathological behaviors and both disorders involve altered reward processing and related neural circuitries  .

eds and alcohol and sub- stance use disorders present with high mortality and morbidity table  but limited treatment options  .recent preclinical studies have shown that the gut microbiota can influence key neural pathways involved in eds and alcohol and substance use disorders.

when adsorbed with a-msh and acth peptides reduced staining was observed for both peptides demonstrating that plasma auto-abs from ed individuals and admi- nistered peptides share similar binding sites and can cross-react  .in summary the ability of auto-abs to interfere in appetite- related peptide signaling and the influence of gut microbial proteins in modulating this signaling demonstrates the potential impact of the microbiome-gut-brain axis on behaviors related to eds.gut microbiota dysbiosis and alcohol and substance use disordersbroad overview of the fielduntil recently little was known about the specific effects of alcohol on the gut microbiome.

more generally psychobiotics organisms that beneficially impact the health of patients with psychiatric illnesses have been demonstrated to impact depression and anxiety   and could be tested in future studies on ed and alcohol and substance use disorders.conclusionthis systematic review supports preliminary evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in eds and alcohol and substance use disorders and suggests that additional investigation is needed to determine what is causative versus epiphenomenological.

original papers focused on the gut microbiota and potential behavioral implications were deemed eligible for consideration.results the resulting 12 publications were limited to gut microbiota studies related to eds and alcohol and substance use disorders.

the studies reviewed above demonstrate that alterations to the gut microbiota in clinical presentations of both ed and aud have been correlated with altered anxiety and depressive behavior potentially indicating a shared mechanism of influence exerted by the gut microbiota on these behavioral disorders.although this review facilitates the identification of promising directions for future research the paucity of existing research on the topic of behavioral outcomes associated with eds and alcohol and substance use disorders is a limitation of this assessment.

because appetite-regulating neuropeptides are important signaling molecules in hunger and satiety the ability of colonic microbiota to impact appetite and emotion via molecular mimicry may be involved in the development of eds.this review led to eight papers investigating the potential linkbetween the gut microbiota and ed-related behaviors as outline in table and discussed next.preclinical studiesserum levels of auto-abs against appetite-regulating neuropeptides were tested in both germ-free gf sterile of bacterial colonization and specific-pathogen free spf lacking only particular bacteria rats to assess the dependence of auto-ab production on the gut microbiota .
