74128129. additionally resistant phenotypes caused by dissimilar genetic backgrounds can be differentiated 124125. according to recent studies on selected species groups the concordance rate between the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and the actual antibiogram phenotype of the microorganism is between 72-99 although the use of this method is still in its experimental stages due to the lack of properly developed reference libraries of bacterial resistance determinants seeing that only the resistance genes included in the web-based databases will be recognized-a common disadvantage of molecular diagnostic methods 129130.antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria the importance ofgo tosurveillancenowadays the treatment of infections caused by anaerobic bacteria or a mixed infection having an anaerobic component rests upon the following antimicrobials penicillins ampicillinticarcillin beta- lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations amoxicillinclavulanic acid ticarcillinclavulanic acid ampicillinsulbactam piperacillintazobactam cefoxitin and cefotetan cephamycins clindamycintigecycline moxifloxacin macrolides azithromycin clarithromycin chloramphenicol and metronidazole 12393131.some data available on the resistance trends of anaerobes apart from hospital-level or regional surveillance studies conducted where resources were available is restricted to the studies published by anaerobic reference laboratories or major trans-national collaborations 23132133134135136.although the variations between different geographical regions are notable common tendencies can be observed.while three decades ago the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of anaerobic bacteria was straightforward nowadays we cannot so easily predict the efficiency of the chosen empirical therapy 91. clinicians can no longer expect certain drugs to work in anaerobic infections because they showed potent activity before 137. though not at the same speed as some other microorganisms e.g.

any other sample type received should not be accepted for anaerobic processing since they do not meet the requirements risk of oxygen exposure false negative result contaminants false positive results andor cultivation of microorganisms with no clinical significance 5649535455.adequate laboratory conditions are necessary for the cultivation and diagnosis of anaerobic bacteria the most important of which is a suitable method to anaerobiosis stable anaerobic environment for cultivation and the availability of pre-reduced anaerobically sterilised pras media.

from a haemoculture many laboratories however do not possess the instruments required to carry out this assay 6061. for further reading on the phenotypic methods concerning anaerobic bacteria see the wadsworth-ktl anaerobic bacteriology manual which is considered as a reference in the phenotypic identification of these microorganisms 5.the introduction of molecular methods array-based systems and novel technological advancements in clinical microbiology such as whole-genome sequencing wgs and matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time-of-flight maldi-tof mass spectrometry which utilizes the spectra of conserved ribosomal proteins for identification has revolutionised the detection and correct identification of anaerobic bacteria.

if anaerobic bacteria were present at the infection site and we failed to detect them it can often lead to inappropriate therapeutic choices and clinical failure 8.examples of clinically relevant anaerobic bacteriago tomembers of the bacteroides fragilis groupanaerobic gram-negatives include some of the most important human pathogens among the group of anaerobic bacteria.

clsi also recommends that at least 100 randomly selected isolates of a given genera should be tested for their resistance patterns to acquire adequate information on the regional hospital patterns of resistance 102. irrespective of the method used for the susceptibility testing on anaerobic bacteria these all share thefollowing i without the proper stable level of anaerobiosis during the incubation period the results cannot be interpreted 103 ii since the generation time of these bacteria is longer than their aerobic counterparts results of the susceptibility testing can only be interpreted after 48-72 h or more iii extensive quality control and staff experience is required 94 iv breakpoints determined by clsi and eucast do not always match making interpretation of the susceptibility results difficult 102103.disk diffusion method kirby-bauer methoddisk diffusion susceptibility testing is an easy-to-perform and cost-effective technique developed by eucast their standardized methods and clinical breakpoints were embraced by clinical microbiology laboratories in europe as well as in other parts of the globe 104. due to the popularity of this method several studies by eucast or otherwise aiming at the evaluation of the suitability of this technique for the use in routine anaerobic bacteriology mainly aiming at b. fragilis group isolates and fast-growing anaerobic strains were performed 105106. although some of these studies showed promising results in reproducibility the inhibition zone diameters correlated well with the mics in the case of metronidazole imipenem moxifloxacin and tigecycline in other cases intermediate i and susceptible s isolates had overlaps in their inhibition zone diameters in the case of beta-lactambeta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and cefoxitin 107. since the criteria for the use of this method has only been determined on aerobic bacteria so far antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes using the disk diffusion method is not recommended in the routine lab yet and it is only used in a research setting or for preliminary screening for the antibacterial activity of different bioactive compounds 105. however identification disks containing specific antibiotics usually colistin kanamycin metronidazole penicillin and vancomycin are used and sodium polyanethole sulfonate sps are routinely used in the clinical microbiology laboratories for the presumptive identification of these bacteria 5.broth microdilution methodbroth microdilution assay is usually carried out using 96-well microtiter plates where two-fold serial dilutions of the antibiotics are made.

several publications report the emergence of multidrug resistant anaerobic gram-negative bacteria especially within the b. fragilis group isolates harbouring multiple resistance genes or with a combination of intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms 8085147148149150151. in these cases the bacteria were usually termed multidrug resistant if they were resistant to 3-4 antibiotic classes besides metronidazole due to nim nitroimidazole resistance genes and the carbapenems a metallo-b-lactamase encoded by cfiaccra genes 79. mobile genetic elements plasmids containing resistance determinants insertion sequence elements transposons have a significant role in the spread of the multidrug resistant phenotype in anaerobes.the significance of the abovementioned tendencies is further underlined by the fact that treatment failure has been described in empirical treatment in cases of anaerobic bacteraemia as result of a multidrug resistant b. fragilis infection 984152153154155. what makes this problem even more insidious is the fact that the correlation between the presence of multidrug resistant anaerobic bacterial strains and clinical failure is hard to prove.

in this present review our aim was to give an overview of the methods currently available for the identification using phenotypic characteristics biochemical testing gas-liquid chromatography maldi-tof ms and wgs and antimicrobial susceptibility testing agar dilution broth microdilution disk diffusion gradient tests automated systems phenotypic and molecular resistance detection techniques of anaerobes when should these methods be used and what are the recent developments in resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria.keywords anaerobic bacteria susceptibility testing methodology antimicrobial resistance maldi-tof ms bacteroides fragilis group clostridium spp.

as an integral part of the human microbiome these microorganisms can be found in different anatomical sites and they can be responsible for a plethora of infections that may be serious or life-threatening 1234. for this reason anaerobes are often categorized by the body sites where they occur the infections they are associated with although they are most frequently classified by their microscopic morphology rods or cocci and their gram-staining for a summary of the most important genera of anaerobic bacteria see  356. infections caused by anaerobes can also be divided according to the origin of the microorganisms.exogenous anaerobic infections are predominantly caused by gram-positive spore-forming bacilli clostridium spp.

these infections are monobacterial in almost all cases and the effects of bacterial toxins are the prime causes of these pathologies 17. in these cases--although microbiological evaluation is still recommended-- diagnosis is mostly reached based on the characteristic clinical symptoms--on the other hand the overwhelming majority of anaerobic infections are of polymicrobial nature due to multiple causative agents involving both obligate aerobes facultative and obligate anaerobes in addition the vast majority of these organisms originate from the normal flora of the skin and mucous membranes 12. these infections commonly involving anaerobes including but not limited to actinomycosis root canal and other odontogenic infections chronic otitis media chronic sinusitis aspiration pneumonia peritonitis and appendicitis endometritis salpingitis necrotising fasciitis osteomyelitis septic arthritis anaerobic cellulitis infections of wounds and ulcers abscesses of the head and neck region lungs intra-abdominal organs liver fallopian tube ovary and adjacent pelvic organs etc.

248. the involvement of anaerobic infections varies based on the anatomical site but their significance should not be underrated as they are present in around 5-10 of bacteraemia 89 of brain abscesses 93 of post- surgery abdominal infections 76 of thoracic empyemas 95 of diabetic foot infections 52 in chronic sinusitis 30-40 of all bite wound infections and 63 in septic abortions 246910111213. their importance was further underlined when their roles in the pathomechanism of bacterial vaginosis bv and pelvic inflammatory disease pid were explained 1415 also with the emergence of antibiotic- associated diarrhoea aad and toxic megacolon caused by toxin producing clostridium difficile especially the hyper virulent ribotype 027 a significant nosocomial pathogen which is very hard to eradicate both from a hospital hygiene perspective and therapeutic setting 16171819. the clinical significance of anaerobes and the interest concerning these bacteria is steadily increasing with new species described in various infectious processes almost every day especially in immunocompromised patients 20.a range of factors are known to increase the likelihood of anaerobic mixed infections most of which are related to either processes that damage the mucous membranes or conditions reducing the oxygen levels of tissues.

depending on the size of the clinical laboratory and the number of incoming isolates gaspak sachets anoxomat systems or anaerobic chambers glove boxes are used although the availability of some of these is limited to anaerobic reference laboratories 56495356.anaerobic bacteria are fastidious microorganisms culturing them requires nutrition-rich media and some of these include components that allow for the selective growth of these bacteria.

examples include liquid enrichment media like holman-broth chopped meat and carbohydrates and thioglycolate-broth and a variety of pre-reduced anaerobically sterilised solid media anaerobic blood agar brucella blood agar supplemented with 5 lysed horse blood 5 mgml hemin and 1 mgml vitamin k1 bba schaedler blood agar scs bacteroides-bile-esculin agar bbe kanamycin-vancomycin leaked blood agar kvlb or lkv phenylethyl alcohol agar pea cycloserine-cefoxitine fructose agar ccfa colistin-nalidixic acid media cna egg-yolk agar eya 54957.a variety of methods can be used for the identification of anaerobic isolates from presumptive identification based on growth characteristics colony morphology susceptibility to given antibiotics presence or absence of fluorescence classical biochemical tests and spot-tests to commercial kits e.g.

7273 sequencing technologies are-in most cases-still in their developmentalexperimental phase and not necessarily well characterized for anaerobes 2962747576. besides the growing interest in the research related to anaerobic bacteria the description and verification of new species has also been facilitated by the introduction of these new technologies-although such research is limited to reference laboratories with the appropriate facilities 207778.compared to the processing time of aerobic bacteria or facultative anaerobes the workup of anaerobic isolates usually takes much longer.

another significant drawback of this method is that it can only be performed in an anaerobic glove box for the appropriate level of anaerobiosis to be maintained therefore its use in the clinical microbiology lab is limited 108.agar dilution methodagar-dilution method is currently the gold standard for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria.

agar-dilution is an labour-intensive method recommended for anaerobic reference laboratories 23102.gradient tests e-test spiral gradient testgradient tests such as the e-test are the most frequently used in hospital laboratories for performing anaerobic susceptibility testing.
