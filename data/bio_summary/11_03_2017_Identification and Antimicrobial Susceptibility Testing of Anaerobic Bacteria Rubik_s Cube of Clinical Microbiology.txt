According to recent studies on selected species groups the concordance rate between the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and the actual antibiogram phenotype of the microorganism is between 72-99 although the use of this method is still in its experimental stages due to the lack of properly developed reference libraries of bacterial resistance determinants seeing that only the resistance genes included in the web-based databases will be recognized-a common disadvantage of molecular diagnostic methods 129130.Antibiotic Resistance in Anaerobic Bacteria The Importance ofGo toSurveillanceNowadays the treatment of infections caused by anaerobic bacteria or a mixed infection having an anaerobic component rests upon the following antimicrobials penicillins ampicillinticarcillin beta- lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations amoxicillinclavulanic acid ticarcillinclavulanic acid ampicillinsulbactam piperacillintazobactam cefoxitin and cefotetan cephamycins clindamycintigecycline moxifloxacin macrolides azithromycin clarithromycin chloramphenicol and metronidazole 12393131.Some data available on the resistance trends of anaerobes apart from hospital-level or regional surveillance studies conducted where resources were available is restricted to the studies published by anaerobic reference laboratories or major trans-national collaborations 23132133134135136.Although the variations between different geographical regions are notable common tendencies can be observed.While three decades ago the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of anaerobic bacteria was straightforward nowadays we cannot so easily predict the efficiency of the chosen empirical therapy 91.

from faeces although this method is not yet routinely used in diagnostic laboratories 116.Detection of resistance genes using polymerase chain reaction is a reliable method of identifying various antibiotic resistance determinants for example nim genes responsible for metronidazole resistance erm genes conferring resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin MLS group of antimicrobials the cfiA gene of carbapenem resistance gyr and parC implicated in quinolone resistance cat gene of chloramphenicol resistance various tet genes making the microorganism resistant to tetracycline etc.

In this present review our aim was to give an overview of the methods currently available for the identification using phenotypic characteristics biochemical testing gas-liquid chromatography MALDI-TOF MS and WGS and antimicrobial susceptibility testing agar dilution broth microdilution disk diffusion gradient tests automated systems phenotypic and molecular resistance detection techniques of anaerobes when should these methods be used and what are the recent developments in resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria.Keywords anaerobic bacteria susceptibility testing methodology antimicrobial resistance MALDI-TOF MS Bacteroides fragilis group Clostridium spp.

arabinogalactan starch pectin xylan 62350.The antibiotic resistance levels among anaerobes is the best characterized in Bacteroides isolates and according to the relevant literature the species of the genus have the highest levels of antibiotic resistance and the most numerous number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms among all human pathogenic anaerobic bacteria described in detail in Section 5 7980.

the macrolide and rifampin resistance in Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. mortiferum and the resistance against cephalosporins in C. difficile.Clindamycin was considered the gold standard for the treatment of anaerobic infections some 40-50 years ago but with the emergence of high levels of resistance among C. difficile 70 B. fragilis group 30- 40 Prevotella spp.

carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Pseudomonas aeruginosa or members of the Enterobacteriaceae 138 resistance has steadily increased among anaerobes during the last 30 years.With the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in addition to the suitable surgical measures the issue of emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria was maybe less obvious 93131.

Several publications report the emergence of multidrug resistant anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria especially within the B. fragilis group isolates harbouring multiple resistance genes or with a combination of intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms 8085147148149150151.

Such a pathogen of increasing importance is Sutterella wadsworthiensis with increasing resistance rates to piperacillintazobactam cefoxitin clindamycin and metronidazole 182183.Metronidazole resistance is common in various Gram-positive anaerobic rods Actinomyces spp.

These resistance determinants are predominantly found in the chromosome but their presence has been described in transferable plasmids and IS elements as well with some experts fearing the rapid dissemination of these genes 149150185186187188189190191192193194.Tetracycline resistance is very common in anaerobic isolates 95 of Bacteroides spp.

Any other sample type received should not be accepted for anaerobic processing since they do not meet the requirements risk of oxygen exposure false negative result contaminants false positive results andor cultivation of microorganisms with no clinical significance 5649535455.Adequate laboratory conditions are necessary for the cultivation and diagnosis of anaerobic bacteria the most important of which is a suitable method to anaerobiosis stable anaerobic environment for cultivation and the availability of pre-reduced anaerobically sterilised PRAS media.
