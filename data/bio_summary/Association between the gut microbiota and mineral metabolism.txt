In in vitro cultures of the human intestinal micro- biota an increase in the iron content of the culture medium in amounts simulating oral iron supplementation causes a decrease in the amount of commensal bacteria.66 However Bifidobacteri- aceae can bind iron present in the large intestine thereby limit- ing the formation of free radicals synthesized in the presence of iron and thus reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.67 A high level of iron in the intestine promotes the development of pathogenic flora.

Studies of a rat model of celiac disease have shown that oral intake of B. longum CECT 7347 reduces gliadin-induced iron accumulation in hepatocytes and enhances the mobilization of this element from the liver.3 Changes in the gut microbiota that lead to malfunctions of the functional microbe-gut-brain axis induced by magnesium deficiency corre- late with a decrease in the production of interleukin-6 IL-6 within the hippocampus which causes symptoms of depression5 and anxiety disorders in mice81 dependent on the length of magne- sium deficiency.Ren et al.82 have shown that the oral intake of selenium lentinan proportionally increases the gut levels of Lactobacillus Bacteroides Prevotella and Roseburia and reduces the gut levels of Firmicutes Alistipes Parabacteroides Ruminococcus and Helicobacter.A summary of animal studies is presented in Table 3.HUMAN STUDIESThe gut microbiota and minerals in healthThere is a relative dearth of new studies on the interaction between the microbiota and minerals in healthy people.

Previous studies revealed that this inverse relationship can be probably due to increased iron absorption by the gut microflora.414 Moreover Lactobacillus does not need iron for its development so it can exist in iron-deficient state.1967 In a study of people suffering from Crohn's disease improvements in the intestinal microflora and reductions in the severity of the dis- ease have been observed following the elimination of iron from the diet.87 Rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis lead- ing to chronic inflammation adversely affect the transport and metabolism of iron zinc silver and sulfur in the oral cavity micro- biota and the intestinal microflora.

UA inhibits reactive oxygen species ROS production and its increased syn- thesis positively influences the host's health state by protecting the host from oxidative stress and inflammation.14 Moreover Lac- tobacillus fermentum present in the gut microflora due to excreted p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid shows a ferric-reducing activity that enables the reduction of FeIII to FeII.4 FeII unlike FeIII can be absorbed by the host's enterocytes.54 To sum up the gut micro- biota favorably modifies dietary non-heme iron transformations in the intestine not only by increasing FeIII content but also by supporting FeIII reduction to FeII which leads to an increase in iron availability.

Commensal bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus which prevent colonization of the intestine by pathogenic microorgan- isms do not need iron for their own metabolic processes and lack the siderophores necessary to absorb iron from the intesti- nal lumen these microorganisms instead take up manganese for their own metabolic processes.1967 The excessive intake of iron in the diet leads to the intense growth of pathogenic intestinal flora in place of commensal flora Lactobacillus reducing the availabil- ity to the host of iron from the intestine.

In studies on mice it has been observed that a lack of iron in the diet results in the extended life of Caenorhabditis elegans inhibiting the development of the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella typhimurium and reducing the severity of the inflammatory response.78 Mice completely lacking intestinal bacteria show iron deficiencies in the intestinal epithe- lial cells which can be compensated for only in the presence of the commensal bacteria Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 and the probiotic bac- terium Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9.64 It has been shown that a deficiency of iron in the diet is a main factor in the decline in the diversity of the intestinal microflora in weaning rats.

More- over it has been shown that complementation of iron deficiency causes only a partial reconstruction of the gut microbiota in such cases FeSO4 supplementation is more effective than nano-FeIII supplementation.79 Also the supply of lactoferrin contributes to the intensification of the growth of intestinal bifidobacteria in mice and pigs.69 Tako et al.80 have shown that the intra-amniotic supply of prebiotic extract of wheat has no effect on the bioavailability of iron but causes growth in the intestinal bifidobacteria and lac- tobacilli populations.

Proper modification of gut microbiota can ameliorate intestinal wall permeability to minerals which can positively affect both maternal and fetal min- eral metabolism.85The gut microbiota and minerals in diseaseMany pathogenic intestinal bacteria such as Salmonella Shigella and Escherichia coli compete for unabsorbed iron in the intestine.

These culture-independent analytical methods allow one not only to identify individual gut microflora but also to target a wide range of diseases including metabolic disorders and pathologic states caused by imbalance in the gut microbiota and nutrient intake.93 In modern probiotics production bioinfor- matics has become a crucial investigational technique enablingthe generation of theoretical models of the impact of probiotic species on the normal and abnormal human microbiota and allowing the preparation of probiotics targeted for the therapy of selected diseases.36Currently much research is being performed on the effects of the intestinal microbiota on colon cancer autoimmune diseases and diseases of civilization on the possibility of microorganism penetration through the placenta and on interactions between the microbiota and the central nervous system that may induce depression.21 Some interesting studies have also begun on the use of unconventional probiotic organisms such as Faecalibacterium Akkermansia and Eubacterium however the lack of safety dataK Skrypnik J Suliburskaon their use in humans is a significant impediment.36 Innovative research is being performed on the possibility of modifying the microbiota without causing pathogenic effects.21 There are still no reliable data on the interrelations between the human animal plant and soil microbiota.21CONCLUSIONRecent studies have produced much new information on microbiota -mineral interactions and have mainly concerned the impact of intestinal bacteria on the metabolism of calcium and iron.
