Fecal transplant of gut microbiota from male NOD mice to female NOD recipients increases CRAMP production and reduces the incidence of diabetes indicating a causative effectof male gut microbiota in controlling autoimmune diabetes.Metabolites retinoic acidRetinoic acid a metabolite of vitamin A has a wide range of biological activity including regu- lating immune responses.74 A major part of retinoic acid's anti-inflammatory effects depends on the inhibition of TH17 and promotion of FOXP3 Treg responses.7475 AM80 is a synthetic retinoic acid that is characterized by higher stability and fewer potential adverse effects compared with all-trans- retinoic acid one of the most active physiologi- cal retinoid metabolites.7677 It has been reported that retinoic acid and AM80 ameliorate many autoimmune responses including experimental autoimmune myositis experimental autoimmune encephalitis and collagen-induced arthritis.78-81 We recently showed that oral administration of AM80 inhibits autoimmune disease in joints as well as in lung.82 We elucidated a novel mechanism whereby AM80 suppresses the autoimmune pathology at both lung and joints by inhibiting TFH and TH17 responses.

Thus the microbiota epigenetically regulate gene expression to dampen autoimmune inflammation but increase the ability to respond to outside challenges.Linking gut microbiota to gut-distal autoimmune diseasesIt is clear that dysbiosis of gut microbiota affects many extraintestinal autoimmune diseases and immune disorders including RA T1D multiple sclerosis and asthma.788 How do microbiota residing in the gut affect disease outside the gut To address this question we took advantage of the KikGR transgenic mouse line which ubiquitously expresses the green-to-red photoconvertible fluo- rescent protein in its cells.8990 We first generated KikGR.KBxN mice which express the KikGR transgene on the KBxN background.

Finally while microbial recognition by the innate and adap- tive immune system has been firmly established recent studies have uncovered a crucial role for microbial metabolites in the orchestration of the host immune response.54 We highlight examples of how microbiota-mediated metabolites and epige- netic modifications control the immune system and ultimately affect autoimmune development.The innate immune system and the adjuvant effectInfection has long been linked to the onset of autoimmune disease.255 Neutrophils are a key innate immune cell type at the front line of fighting infectious diseases.56 Neutrophils are increasingly being recognized as integral players in the cross talk between microbiota and the host immune system as they respond to signals from the microbiota and control the expansion of the microbiome.

Together these studies suggest that targeting gut immune cells may serve as a novel therapeutic method to treat systemic diseases.A later report provides further evidence for gut microbiota-dependent cell migration from the gut to another extraintestinal site the kidney contribut- ing to autoimmune development Fig.

Thus microbial mimicry is involved in activation of both autoimmune CD4 and CD8 T cells raising the possibility that activation of autoimmune T cells by commensal microbes might be more common than is currently appreciated.Recently one group reported that long-chain fatty acids LCFAs enhanced the differentiation and proliferation of TH1 andor TH17 cells while SCFAs expanded gut Treg cells.71 Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE as a model for multiple sclerosis Haghikia et al.

Pathogens including bacteria and viruses have long been associated with autoimmune diseases.12 Recently expansions of pathogenic commensal bacteria--pathobionts-- have been found in patients with autoimmune diseases and in animal autoimmune models.

This is an urgent subject as dysbiosis-related diseases have emerged as new epidemics in the industrialized world.5-7 It is important to emphasize that despite the focus of this review on the potential detrimental role of microbiota in autoimmunity a healthy commensal community is beneficial to the host for example commensal bacteria can provide crucial nutrients such as vitamins B and K as well as control immune homeostasis extensively discussed in a recent review.8doi 10.1111nyas.13508The role of microbiota and gender in autoimmune developmentThe gender dimorphism of susceptibility to autoim- mune disease is a well-established phenomenon.9 The seminal discovery by Markle et al.10 provides a new perspective into the role of sex hormones in autoimmune disease development.

Because the majority of gut microbiota are unculturable the 16S rRNA sequencing analysis which is used by most of the studies discussed below has replaced the tradi- tional culture-based techniques for characterizing microbial communities in any given sample.4 Here we review factors affecting the role of microbiota in autoimmunity as well as the mechanisms whereby microbiota trigger an autoimmune response with a focus on gut microbiota.

Though it is not clear whether the increase in these bacteria was a cause or result of disease in the female Tnfr2-- 2D2 mice this study suggests that anti- TNF therapy may disrupt commensal-host immune homeostasis in a gender-specific manner that leads to autoimmune demyelination.The influence of age on microbiota and immune disordersAge-dependent disease in mouse models Airway exposure to bacteria can suppress aller- gic airway inflammation in adult mice.13 How- ever studies indicate that such treatments could be greatly optimized by administering the therapy at an optimal age window because age is an important fac- tor in immunoregulation of the lung.

Although autoimmune diseases occur when the adaptive immune sys- tem fails to maintain self-tolerance the innate immune system may be a culprit in facilitating the breakdown of self-tolerance.
