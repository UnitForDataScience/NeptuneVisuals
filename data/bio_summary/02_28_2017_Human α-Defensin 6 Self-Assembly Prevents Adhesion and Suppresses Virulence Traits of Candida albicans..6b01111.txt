Prior studies of the antimicrobial activity of HD6 have mainly focused on bacteria and demonstrated that HD6 provides neither bacteriostatic nor bactericidal activity against various Gram-negative and -positive bacterial strains.It was also reported that both oxidized and reduced the linear peptide that has six free cysteine thiols forms of HD6 did not exhibit activity against C. albicans in an agar plate assay in which growth inhibition zones were quantified.Building upon this prior work we first conducted antifungal activity assays with native 32-residue HD6 and a single-point variant named F2A both in the oxidized form with three disulfide linkages.

These results demonstrate that the population of C. albicans shifts from the biofilm to the supernatant when HD6 is present.To investigate whether the effect of HD6 on C. albicans biofilm formation is reversible we treated C. albicans with HD6 for 24 h washed the planktonic cells to remove HD6 and then resuspended the cells in fresh medium without the peptide.

Once HD6 was removed from the culture C. albicans formed biofilms to an extent similar to that of the untreated control C. On the other hand when HD6 was added back to the culture after the wash step the amount of C. albicans biofilm was reduced to 20 relative to that of the untreated control which was comparable to the amount of biofilm formed after a single treatment with HD6.

When C. albicans HFGP3 was treated with HD6 and imaged we observed no distinct difference in the fungal morphology among untreated HD6- treated and F2A-treated cultures by DIC microscopy C. Moreover comparable GFP emission was observed for untreated HD6-treated and F2A-treated C. albicans indicating that the fungi underwent the transition into true hyphae in the absence and presence of HD6 C. These data indicatethat HD6 does not inhibit the fungal transition to the hyphal form.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this work we consider how a self-assembling host-defensepeptide deployed by the intestinal innate immune system mediates the virulence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen C. albicans.

Fungal invasion of the host epithelium and subsequent dissemination as well as biofilm formation pose serious challenges to the host and can complicate the treatment of candidiasis and confer enhanced resistance to antifungal drugs.Further studies of how HD6 prevents C. albicans adhesion and biofilm formation may lead to development of new strategies for preventing and treating candidiasis and other microbial infections.ASSOCIATED CONTENTS Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the at DOI .Table of C. albicans strains used in this study Table S1 additional images of C. albicans adhesion assays with different concentrations of HD6 images of C. albicans morphology in YPD medium and additional SEM images of C. albicans treated with different concen- trations of HD6 Figures S1-S4 AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding AuthorE-mail .ORCIDElizabeth M.

We report that HD6 prevents adhesion of C. albicans to host cells and suppresses its virulence traits and demonstrate that the self- assembly of HD6 is required for these biological functions.

A 90 mL aliquot of the resulting solution was transferred to a new well and the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded using a plate reader.For the assays in which HD6 was removed during the incubation 400 mL of the C. albicans SC5314 culture in RPMI was treated with 20 mM HD6 and 100 mL of the mixture was added to each of four wells of a 96-well plate.

The phenylalanine F at position 2 of HD6 contributes to formation of a hydrophobic pocket among four HD6 monomers and hence oligomer formation.The F2A variant contains an alanine A at this position and we previously reported that this peptide cannot form higher-order oligomers and lacks functional activity against the Gram-positive bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.We examined the antifungal activity of these two peptides against C. albicans SC5314 in liquid culture using either mid-log- or stationary-phase cultures because the fungi exhibit different metabolic activity depending on the growth phase.

Because previous studies demonstrated that HD6 protects host cells against invasion by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens we evaluated whether HD6 also protects host cells from fungi.
