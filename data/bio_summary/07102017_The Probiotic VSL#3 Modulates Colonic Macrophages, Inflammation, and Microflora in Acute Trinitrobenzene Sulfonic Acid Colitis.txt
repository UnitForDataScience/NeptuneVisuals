This is consistent with our previous finding that M1 macrophages maintained their pro- inflammatory phenotype despite exposure to VSL3 in vitro.30 However this contrasts with a previous report that VSL3 treatment reduces colonic M1 macrophages defined as F480MCP-1 cells.29 It is worth pointing out that the prevalence of F480MCP-1 cells in the afore- mentioned study did not correlate with histopathological changes between mice expressing or deficient in PPAR-g treated with VSL3 that F480 staining is more prevalent on resident M2-like colonic macrophages than in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages1215 and thatMCP-1 is not routinely used to identify M1 macrophages in the mouse.39 We therefore conclude that the com- bined current evidence does not support the reduction of M1 macrophages as a mechanism of action for the anticolitic effect of VSL3 in animal models of colitis.

Members of the Akkermansia genus specifically A. muciniphila have been suggested to enhance epithelial barrier integrity.62 Certain members of the Clostridium genus have been shown to have protective effects against colitis.763 Members of the Prevotella genus are increased in the flora of patients with IBD.6465 Therefore one possible mechanism by which VSL3 attenuated colitis in our animals was by the modulation of these bacteria.In summary the VSL3 induced-changes that we have observed are likely due to a combination of sev- eral mechanisms including the modification of the gut microflora5457 secretion of bacterial products such as conjugated linoleic acid29 and lactocepin66 ligation of Toll-like receptor 9 by VSL3 bacterial DNA67 and enhancement of the epithelial barrier.536869 Whether either the presence of colonic macrophages or the inhibition of colonic macrophage infiltration is essential or important for mediating the beneficial effects of VSL3 should be the subject of future investigations.AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge Abner Vazquez Siomara Hernandez Josue Caban Pablo Lopez Raphael Sanchez Yasuhiro Yamamura and Alcira Benitez Barros for techni- cal assistance.

Nevertheless the fol- lowing statistically nonsignificant changes were observed relative to normal transcript levels colitis induction decreased transcript levels for all the pro- inflammatory factors measured Il1b Il12 Nos2 Ccl2 Mcp-1 the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il10 and the tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5 whereas VSL3 treatment increased transcript levels for all analytes except Il1b.Treatment With VSL3 Alters the Composition of Fecal MicrofloraPrevious studies have shown that VSL3 treatment leads to changes in the intestinal flora both in patientswith IBD and in several animal models of IBD.

9B as macrophage numbers in tissue from chronic colitis rats and chronic colitisVSL3 rats contained similar numbers of mac- rophages in areas of IBD 70.26 - 6.33 and 63.42 -3.45 cells per HPF respectively dysplasia 53.24 -and 71.20 - 7.32 cells per HPF respectively and cancer 77.60 - 21.38 and 52 - 15.00 cells per HPF.Liver Macrophage Accumulation Is Not Affected by VSL3 TreatmentMacrophages have recently been shown to accumu- late in the liver in several models of colitis.38 We there- fore asked whether this accumulation could be attenuated by treatment with VSL3 given the inhibi- tory effect VSL3 had on colonic macrophage infiltra- tion.

It has been suggested that the probiotic mixture VSL3 exerts its anticolitic effects by reducing M1 macrophages in the inflamed colon.29 We have previ- ously demonstrated in an in vitro model that VSL3 not only alters the morphology of polarized M1M2 and unpolarized macrophages but also modifies the secre- tion of cytokines and chemokines in these cells in a polarization-dependent manner.30 In general the pro- inflammatory phenotype of M1 macrophages was rel- atively unaffected whereas M2 and unpolarized macrophages were shifted toward a more balanced phenotype in which an augmentation of their anti- inflammatorypro-healing phenotype was accompa- nied by an increase in their pro-inflammatory potential.

VSL3 treat- ment of chronic colitis rats as for acute colitis rats began 1 week before colitis induction and continued until time of sacrifice with VSL3 administered ad libitum dissolved in drinking water.Sample CollectionAt the time of sacrifice blood was collected by cardiac puncture and the colon was resected.
