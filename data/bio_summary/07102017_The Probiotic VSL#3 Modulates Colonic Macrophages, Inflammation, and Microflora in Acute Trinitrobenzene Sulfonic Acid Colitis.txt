this is consistent with our previous finding that m1 macrophages maintained their pro- inflammatory phenotype despite exposure to vsl3 in vitro.30 however this contrasts with a previous report that vsl3 treatment reduces colonic m1 macrophages defined as f480mcp-1 cells.29 it is worth pointing out that the prevalence of f480mcp-1 cells in the afore- mentioned study did not correlate with histopathological changes between mice expressing or deficient in ppar-g treated with vsl3 that f480 staining is more prevalent on resident m2-like colonic macrophages than in pro-inflammatory m1 macrophages1215 and thatmcp-1 is not routinely used to identify m1 macrophages in the mouse.39 we therefore conclude that the com- bined current evidence does not support the reduction of m1 macrophages as a mechanism of action for the anticolitic effect of vsl3 in animal models of colitis.

members of the akkermansia genus specifically a. muciniphila have been suggested to enhance epithelial barrier integrity.62 certain members of the clostridium genus have been shown to have protective effects against colitis.763 members of the prevotella genus are increased in the flora of patients with ibd.6465 therefore one possible mechanism by which vsl3 attenuated colitis in our animals was by the modulation of these bacteria.in summary the vsl3 induced-changes that we have observed are likely due to a combination of sev- eral mechanisms including the modification of the gut microflora5457 secretion of bacterial products such as conjugated linoleic acid29 and lactocepin66 ligation of toll-like receptor 9 by vsl3 bacterial dna67 and enhancement of the epithelial barrier.536869 whether either the presence of colonic macrophages or the inhibition of colonic macrophage infiltration is essential or important for mediating the beneficial effects of vsl3 should be the subject of future investigations.acknowledgmentsthe authors acknowledge abner vazquez siomara hernandez josue caban pablo lopez raphael sanchez yasuhiro yamamura and alcira benitez barros for techni- cal assistance.

it has been suggested that the probiotic mixture vsl3 exerts its anticolitic effects by reducing m1 macrophages in the inflamed colon.29 we have previ- ously demonstrated in an in vitro model that vsl3 not only alters the morphology of polarized m1m2 and unpolarized macrophages but also modifies the secre- tion of cytokines and chemokines in these cells in a polarization-dependent manner.30 in general the pro- inflammatory phenotype of m1 macrophages was rel- atively unaffected whereas m2 and unpolarized macrophages were shifted toward a more balanced phenotype in which an augmentation of their anti- inflammatorypro-healing phenotype was accompa- nied by an increase in their pro-inflammatory potential.

however vsl3 treatment did not decrease the percentage of colonic macrophages with an m1 pheno- type as determined by double immunofluorescence forfigure 10. vsl3 treatment does not affect colitis-induced macrophage accumulation in the liver.

although it is possible that the most proximal portions of the colon are the sites where tnbs dwells the least we do not feel that this contributes to decreased proximal colon injury given that average microscopic damage scores for untreated colitis rats were comparable across the proximal middle and distal colonic segments.we have previously demonstrated that vsl3 ame- liorates inflammation and delays the transition from chronic inflammation to neoplasia in chronic tnbs- induced colitis in rats.31 this chemopreventive effect has subsequently been confirmed by others.4445 interestingly in the current study we found that mucosal macro- phages in the colon of rats with chronic colitis with or without vsl3 treatment and of age-matched normal rats all from our previous study did not differ in number.

interestingly vsl3 decreased serum levels of il-2 a cytokine important for t-cell activation and lev- els for il-12p70 il-5 il-13 and il-17a were not signifi- cantly elevated in vsl3-treated rats suggesting that vsl3 treatment decreased the activation of th1 th2 and th17 helper t cells.
