Consumers evaluated four different conditions control lettuce lettuce washed with thyme EO 250 mgL lettuce washed with the biocontrol agent and lettuce washed with both thyme EO 125 mgL and the biocontrol agent.Genomic DNA extraction pyrosequencing and quantitative analysis of the microbiome compositionDNA was adjusted to 10 ngmL concentration and used as tem- plate for 16S Metagenomic 454 Sequencing Analyses.Total genomic DNA was extracted directly from lamb's lettuce kit Mo-bio Cambrex Biosciences Bergamo Italy.

The pH of the washing solutions before the treatments resulted 7.04 in case of addition of chlorine 120 mgL 6.85 and 6.76 in case of addition of thyme EO 250 mgL and the biocontrol agent alone respectively and 6.81 for the combination thyme EO and the biocontrol agent.Prepared lettuce was immersed in an industrial washing tank and agitated in the appropriate washing solution at 8 oC for 1 min 10 kg of lettuce in 180 L of washing solution.

UK incubated aerobically at 30 oC for 24 h then the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000g for 15 min in a J-25 Beckman Coulter centrifuge at room temperature re-suspended in salinesolution and inoculated in the washing solution.

LAB counts in samples washed with chlorine and thyme EO ranged between 2.4 and 3.0 log cfug during the whole period of storage.a Samples washed with the biocontrol agent L. lactis CBM21 Inoculated at a level of 6 log cfumL in the washing solution.b Samples washed with thyme essential oil 125 mgL th L. lactis CBM21 Inoculated at a level of 6 log cfumL in the washing solution.Table 2Mesophilic aerobic bacteria count on lamb's lettuce treated with thyme EO the biocontrol agent their combination or chlorine.Counts are expressed in Log cfug th- standard deviation.

The washing with thyme EO was reflected in the presence of g-terpinene p-cymene b-phellandrene limo- nene terpinolene camphene caryophyllene thymol and carvacrolthat represent the characteristic molecules of thyme EO.

The OTUs highlighted in the legend were statistically significant p  Mo 0.05.phenyl ethyl alcohol.In order to better show the effects of the washing solution on the volatile molecule profiles the GC-MS-SPME data were sub- jected to a Principal Component Analysis PCA excluding from the analyses the molecules from thyme EO and those deriving from their further transformation by lettuce tissues or microorganisms according to literature data .

Working protocol used to prepare lamb's lettuce the addition of lactic acid bacteria andor thyme EO was performed during the washing phase samples washed with chlorine 120 mgL represented the controls.immediately after treatments and after 3 5 7 10 and 12 days of storage.

Lamb's lettuce cell loads immediately after the treatment were 5.1 and 5.4 log CFUg in the samples treated with the biocontrol agent alone and in combina- tion with thyme EO respectively.

In fact the analysis of the microbiota of the different lettuce samples highlighted the ability of both the biocontrol culture as well as thyme EO to significantly change the relative proportions between the different spoilage species.
