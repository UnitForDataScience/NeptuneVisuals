This analysis included previously published studies concerning adults of seven phlebotomine sand fly species P. argentipes P. chinensis P. duboscqi P. halepensis P. sergenti P. papatasi P. perfiliewi our study reported on P. perniciosus and previously pub- lished data reported on three Lutzomyia species L. cruzi L. evansi L. longipalpis -.

October is characterized by B. oleronus and unidentifiedNetwork analysis showing the shared bacteria species found in Phlebotomus sand flies including P. argentipes P. duboscqii P. halepensis P. papatasi P. perlifiliewi P. perniciosus P. sergenti and P. chinensis identified by squares surrounded by green and bacteria found in Lutzomyia sand flies including L. evansi L. cruzi and L. longipalpis identified with squares surrounded by blue.

The overall dataset used in our analyses included ten Phlebotominae L. cruzi L. longipalpis  L. evansi  P. argentipes  P. duboscqi  P. halepensis P. papatasi - P. sergenti  P. perfiliewi  P. chinensis  and P. perniciosus and their associated microbiota for the present study.

In this study we isolated B. subtilis from P. perniciosus midgut in addition to other Bacillus species Bacillus oleronius Bacillus casamensis Bacillus galactosidilyticus and Bacillus sp.. Bacteria belonging to the Bacillus genus seem to display a host-specific distribu- tion with only B. subtilis being isolated in more than one sand fly species P. halepensis P. papatasi and P. perniciosus.

Color chart indicate the occurrence of the bacterial genera or species.Nevertheless in the Meta-Set no significant differences in the microbiota composition at the genus level was observed as demonstrated in the that depicts the Shannon left and Simpson right indices of diversity for Old World i.e Phlebotomus and New World sand flies Lutzomyia.Monthly dynamics of the gut bacterial consortium during the main period of P. perniciosus activitydepicts the monthly proportions of each previously characterized bacterial species.

The occurrence of Bacillus subtilis in P. perniciosus and at least two other sand fly species studied so far sug- gests that this bacterial species is a potential candidate for paratransgenic or biolological approaches for the control of sand fly populations in order to prevent Leishmania transmission.IntroductionSand flies are vectors of various pathogens including arboviruses and bacteria but are best known as the principal vectors of Leishmania the etiological agent of leishmaniasis a neglected tropical disease with clinical symptoms varying in form from cutaneous to visceral .

Bacillus thuringiensis is the only spe- cies of the Bacillus genus that was isolated from L. evansi and P. chinensis two sand fly species belonging to the New World and Old World respectively .Bacterial genera part I and species part II shared by two or more of the eleven Phlebotominae sand flies species.

But clearly most bacterial species 76 are sparsely distributed between Phlebotominae species.ConclusionSignificanceOur results pinpoint the need for a more exhaustive understanding of the bacterial richness and abundance at the species level in Phlebotominae sand flies in order to capture the role of midgut bacteria during Leishmania development and transmission.

Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing is highly useful with regards to bacterial classification it has a low phylogenetic power at the species level for some genera .Depending on the 16S rRNA variable region targeted and the database used to perform the taxonomic profiling misassignation of bacterial OTU at the species level could be frequent .

Bacillus subti- lis was isolated from P. halepensis P. papatasi and P. perniciosus.
