The CSFL is fermented from carbohydrate-rich raw material mixture by a unique solid-state anaerobic fermentation process Tao et al.

The former is a traditional starter culture consist- ing of fungi and yeasts that are responsible for simulta- neous saccharification and alcoholic fermentation of the raw materials Hu et al.

The long-aged pits are gener- ally continuously used for decades and thus a unique microbiological flora develops in the pit mud Tao et al.

The CA-produ- cing bacteria are thus considered to be important func- tional members in the PM Fan and Qian 2006 Hu et al.

The Clostridium is reported to produce CA via chain elongation pathway with ethanol as electron donor Bar- ker et al.

The abundance of the Clostridium is more than 50 of total reads in the metagenome generated from a CA-pro- ducing reactor microbiome thus this genus is consid- ered to represent important pools of genes for reverse b oxidation and ethanol oxidation Agler et al.

The universal primers 515F 50- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-30 and 806R 50-GAC-TACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-30 with 10 nt barcodes were used Yan et al.

The PCR was performed according to a previously described method Yao et al.

It accounts for about 70 mar- ket share in total liquor production in China Zhao et al.

2012 Hu et al.
