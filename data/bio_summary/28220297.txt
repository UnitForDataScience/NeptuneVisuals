MicrobiomeIntroductionWith the important observation that the location of the origin of colorectal cancers seems to determine the lethality of the tumors Loupakis et al.

Gervaz et al.

However embryology cannot explain these differences since the midgut and hindgut are derive from the same origin the endoderm and the rectum derives from the cloacal membrane Hill  Sadler  Microbiome differs significantly between the right- and left-sided colon which may explain the gradual changes in MSI and CIMP types of CRC along the length of the gut Yamauchi et al.

Gagniere et al.

for the connexin-expressing but non GJIC-functioning initiated stem cells.LCC are more chromosomally instable and RCC have a higher frequency of MSI-high phenotypes and KRAS and BRAF mutations Venook et al.

Heinemann et al.

Location of the primary tumor is a known prognostic factor for patients with CRC Loupakis et al.
