for this we used a rat model with nafld induced by a high-fat diet involving four experimental groups na standard diet and water nl standard diet and tomato juice ha high-fat diet and water and hl high-fat diet and tomato juice.

in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet tomato juice intake reduced the liver and serum levels of trigly- cerides and cholesterol and the degree of liver steatosis.8 tomato extracts can significantly inhibit nash-promoted early hepatocarcinogenesis in rats with precancerous lesions developing in the context of nash that are being fed a high-fat diet.9 in particular these authors9 observed in liver a decreased number of altered inflammatory foci and mrna expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines tnf-a il-1b and il-12.in previous studies34 our research group has described how tomato juice intake partially reverted the metabolic pattern from a high-fat diet to a normal diet even with regardadepartment of food technology food science and nutrition faculty of veterinary sciences regional campus of international excellence campus mare-nostrum university of murcia.

the acetate to propionate ac  pr ratio was significantly higher in rats fed a high-fat diet than in rats fed a standard diet and in general showed a tendency to decrease in rats consuming tomato juice nl and hl.in the case of rats fed the high-fat diet tomato juice intake significantly reduced the ac  pr ratio by 17 in the hl group with respect to the ha group.

so they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert local andor systemic physiological effects or even modulate the intestinal bacterial population by acting as potential prebiotics.1112 on this basis the aim of the present study was to ascertain the effect of tomato juice intake on certain gut bacterial groups short- chain fatty acids scfas and microbial production of phenolic catabolites in a rat model with high-fat diet-induced nafld.characteristics of the diets and onset of nafldthe standard n maintenance rodent diet 2014c and high-fat h atherogenic rodent diet td-02028 diets were purchased from harlan laboratories inc. madison wi usa and bottled tomato juice was provided by a local producer juver alimentacion s.l.

furthermore tomato juice intake led to reduced concentrations of the plasma inflammation biomarker vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam1 49 in na 50 in nl 120 in ha 89 in hl suggesting improved protection against atherogenesis.overall the statistical analysis performed in the present study revealed that diet standard vs. high-fat was the factor that influenced most of the differences in bacterial groups scfas and microbial phenolic catabolites between the experi- mental groups while the type of drink water vs. tomato juice had a lesser impact on the variables studied table 6. this could be explained by the differences in the intakes of fibre and phenolic compounds between the nanl and hahl groups although their contribution to the observed effects may have varied.in accordance with other animal studies the consumption of a high-fat diet affected the microbiota profile reducing beneficial bacterial groups such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and increasing the counts of enterobacteriaceae.

despite the fact that these authors did not find clear significant differences in the total content of scfas related to the amount of tomato supplemen- tation the lactic acid bacteria level increased in a dose-depen- dent manner in all rats fed with tomato cherry.31 on the con- trary in a previous study with healthy rats we have observed that the consumption of tomato juice increases total butyrate levels in faeces depending on the industrial process of tomato juice and its effects on polysaccharide content more than the content of lycopene in faeces.32 in line with this in a cobiotic mice model involving the intake of lycopene andor prebiotic isomalto-oligosaccharides imos it was shown that both com- pounds per se promoted abundances of beneficial bacteria but the effect was more pronounced upon the consumption of imos.33 as previously reported4 lycopene daily intakes were similar among groups 3.5 mg in nl vs. 3.2 mg in hl and the carotenoid was absorbed well apparent absorptions of 44 in nl and 63 in hl and was detected in liver.

in groups consuming the same diet tomato juice significantlyincreased the total phenolics intake as can be seen by compar- ing nl vs. na and hl vs. ha.effect on microbiota and scfa productionas can be seen from table 4 the intake of the high-fat diet ha vs. na significantly reduced the counts of total bacteria -17. when looking at specific bacterial groups high-fat diet intake reduced lactobacillus -27 bifidobacterium -11 and bacteroides -10 but increased the number of enterobacteriaceae 25. no statistically significant variations were observed for enterococcus among the study groups.

also a significant rise in the activity of the liver alanine alt and aspartate ast aminotransferases was observed in the hahl groups.analysis of microbiota by quantitative pcr qpcrthe dna from large intestinal content samples and from bac- terial cultures used for calibration curves was extracted using the qiamp dna stool mini kit qiagen hilden germany intable 1 nutritional characteristics of the diets and tomato juice used in the studymaterials and methodsexperimental designnutrient amount per 100 gnormal diet nhigh-fat diet htomato juice lthe data reported in the present paper are continuation of a previously published study.34 therefore the animals and the study design are the same.

similarly both fibre and pheno- lic compound intakes were negatively correlated with vcam1 levels4 but statistical significance was only achieved in the case of phenolic compounds r  -968 p  0.05. nevertheless although there is a trend suggesting that phenolic compounds are more effective than fibre in the context of a whole diet theoverall effects might arise from combined effects between fibreand phenolic compounds.studies on humans have shown that most of the phenolic compounds ingested are not absorbed in the stomach and reach the large intestine intact where they are subjected to the activity of the microbiota.114041 this implies that the microbial metabolites rather than the native phenolics could be responsible for the beneficial biological effects in the body.42 thus the accumulation of the tomato juice phenolics andor their catabolites generated in vivo could affect the microbiota profile and its metabolic activity.in this regard several animal and human studies have described the ability of polyphenols and polyphenol-richextracts or foods to repress the proliferation of pathogenic bac- teria andor enhance the growth of beneficial groups therefore displaying prebiotic-like effects by modulating the gut micro- biota.12414344 furthermore in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of phenolic compounds to affect the bacterial growth and scfa production most likely by an indirect mech- anism involving phenolic catabolites generated in vivo rather than the original plant compounds as growth stimulation was observed only with fermented polyphenol media and pure bio- transformation products.36 in addition to gut microbiota activity it should be noted that in our study some of the com- pounds classified as microbial phenolic catabolites detected in faeces came in part from dietary intake as revealed by the estimated dietary intakes of 10 of these 14 compounds detected in faeces table 3. so although they were ingested in low amounts micrograms their contribution to the observed effects should not be ruled out.moreover local beneficial effects could be expected from thepresence of phenolic catabolites in the colon since potential anti-carcinogenic effects have been proposed for instance for p-coumaric acid45 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid46 and pyrogal- lol47 whose concentrations rose upon tomato juice intake.

the first com-ponent pc1 clearly differentiates between rats fed the stan-dard diet nanl and rats fed the high-fat diet hahl while pc2 also discriminates rats with nafld from those consum- ing water or tomato juice hahl.

similarly a lower abundance of faecal bacteroides in rats fed a fibre-free high-fat diet was reportedwhen compared to a high-fat diet containing guar gum as dietary fibre.28 in our study a negative correlation r  -0.992 p  0.01 was also observed between bacteroides and the urinary isoprostane levels previously reported34 indicating an improved oxidative status after tomato juice consumption.changes in the microbiota were accompanied by changes in the profile of the scfas.

soluble and insoluble tomato fibre composition was estimated based on literature data.14 c gae gallic acid equivalents analysed using folin-ciocalteu's phenolreagent.15 d as previously reported.3 e as previously reported.16 f diet and tomato juice samples 2 g were extracted with watermethanolabove-mentioned studywere analysed.

particularly liver l-carnitine increased upon tomato juice intake which can be considered a preventive factor in the evolution of nafld to nash since it indicates a healthier status to maintain mito- chondrial activity concerning b-oxidation and protecting the fatty liver against inflammation and fibrosis.3 furthermore associated with tomato juice intake we reported increased lipid metabolism by inducing an overexpression of genesinvolved in more-efficient liver fatty acid oxidation.
