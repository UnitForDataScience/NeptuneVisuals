considering that bifidobacterium contributed to only 8-10 phylogenetic relative abun- dances the substantial contribution of bifidobactrium 25 and 16 to the total tcaagcttga motifs suggested that the bifidobacterium in the neonatal gut microbiota encoded more copies of the motifs in their genomes than those of other major genera.to ascertain whether the particular enrichment of the tcaagcttga motifs in the bifido- bacterium observed in the present study is the general genomic property in bifidobacterium we analyzed the tcaagcttga motifs in all complete genomes of the major eight genera listed in  which were collected from genbank .

comparative metagenomic analysis showed that immune-regulatory tcaagcttga motifs were significantly enriched in the six healthy controls c communities compared to the six eczema subjects e with many encoded by bifidobacterium 38 of the total motifs in the c communities.

additionally the communities in the stool of controls c were also significantly enriched in functions associated with tetrapyrrole biosyn- thesis compared to those of eczema e. our results show distinct immune-modulatory geno- mic properties of gut microbiota in infants associated with eczema and provide new insights into potential role of gut microbiota in affecting human immune homeostasis.introductioneczema a complex inflammatory disease is one of the earliest manifestations of the allergic march.

to compare the immune-stimulatory genomic potential between c and e communities metage- nomic reads were searched against five cpg motifs whose immunological activities wereimmunosuppressive motifs differentiate c communities from e communities.

for estimating relative abundance expressed as percentage of phylogenetic groups and metabolic pathwaysthe number of metagenomic reads mapped on the protein-coding genes phylogenetically and functionally annotated was also considered for the normalization.genome reconstruction of bifidobacterium populationsto reconstruct draft genome sequences of bifidobacterium populations binning of the assem- bled contigs of individual metagenomic datasets were first carried out based on metagenomic read coverage tetranucleotide frequency and the occurrence of unique marker genes using maxbin .

induction and balance of th1th2 exerted by bifidobacterium are strain-dependent .knowing that the genus bifidobacterium encompasses at least more than 30 taxa based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis  we evaluated various bifidobacterium populations pres- ent in the infant gut communities by constructing near-complete genome sequences.

the aligned metagenomic reads  1 of the total were discarded and the remaining metagenomic reads were used for further analysis.the hybrid protocol that employs a combination of velvet soapdenovo2 and newbler 2.8 assemblers was used to assemble each metagenomic dataset as described previously -.phylogenetic and functional annotation of metagenomic sequencesmetagenomic reads obtained from highseq 2500 and miseq v2sequencing were searched against the small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna gene hyper variable v9 region posi- tions 1380-1510 database  using blastn with a cutoff of  80 nucleotide identity and  90 target length coverage.

emerging evidence showing gut microbiota is important for the normal develop- ment of immune system an extension of the hygiene hypothesis the 'microflora hypothesis' of allergic diseases highlights the potential role of gut microbiota in modulating host immunity has been proposed .this hypothesis is supported by some population studies showing that reduced microbial diversity in early life is associated with the development of eczema - although others have failed to support this finding -.through the evaluation of microbial 16srrna genes studies have shown that the composi- tion of the fecal microbiota community differs between eczema and healthy controls in infancy.

by examining differential abundances of the six individ- ual populations as well as the total bifidobacterium genus we showed that the level of the spe- cific bifidobacterium population b. longum-bfn-121-2 could discriminate c communities from e communities.
