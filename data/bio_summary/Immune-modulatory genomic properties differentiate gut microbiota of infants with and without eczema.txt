Comparative metagenomic analysis showed that immune-regulatory TCAAGCTTGA motifs were significantly enriched in the six healthy controls C communities compared to the six eczema subjects E with many encoded by Bifidobacterium 38 of the total motifs in the C communities.

Considering that Bifidobacterium contributed to only 8-10 phylogenetic relative abun- dances the substantial contribution of Bifidobactrium 25 and 16 to the total TCAAGCTTGA motifs suggested that the Bifidobacterium in the neonatal gut microbiota encoded more copies of the motifs in their genomes than those of other major genera.To ascertain whether the particular enrichment of the TCAAGCTTGA motifs in the Bifido- bacterium observed in the present study is the general genomic property in Bifidobacterium we analyzed the TCAAGCTTGA motifs in all complete genomes of the major eight genera listed in  which were collected from GenBank .

To compare the immune-stimulatory genomic potential between C and E communities metage- nomic reads were searched against five CpG motifs whose immunological activities wereImmunosuppressive motifs differentiate C communities from E communities.

For estimating relative abundance expressed as percentage of phylogenetic groups and metabolic pathwaysthe number of metagenomic reads mapped on the protein-coding genes phylogenetically and functionally annotated was also considered for the normalization.Genome reconstruction of Bifidobacterium populationsTo reconstruct draft genome sequences of Bifidobacterium populations binning of the assem- bled contigs of individual metagenomic datasets were first carried out based on metagenomic read coverage tetranucleotide frequency and the occurrence of unique marker genes using MaxBin .

By examining differential abundances of the six individ- ual populations as well as the total Bifidobacterium genus we showed that the level of the spe- cific Bifidobacterium population B. longum-BFN-121-2 could discriminate C communities from E communities.

induction and balance of Th1Th2 exerted by Bifidobacterium are strain-dependent .Knowing that the genus Bifidobacterium encompasses at least more than 30 taxa based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis  we evaluated various Bifidobacterium populations pres- ent in the infant gut communities by constructing near-complete genome sequences.
