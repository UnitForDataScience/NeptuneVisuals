Overall the results of the present study highlight that fungal as well as bacterial communities in different plant compartments should be analyzed in future studies.Abundant Microbial Taxa Differ between Cropping Regime Plant Species and Plant CompartmentWe further analyzed the abundances of the predominantfungal and bacterial taxonomic groups as we found that fungal and bacterial communities respond in a crop species- and plant compartment-dependent manner to cropping regime.

Effect of cropping regime on bacterial and fungal richness diversity and community structure in faba bean and wheat.BacteriaFungiFaba beanWheatFaba beanWheatMI and leaf endosphere samples of wheat under the cropping regimes WM and MI.We identified several bacterial and fungal taxa with plant growth-promoting potential such as Burkholderia Pseudomonas Rhizobium C. subhashii and Streptomyces bungoensis.

Moreover cropping regimes significantly altered fungal communities in rhizosphere soil and root endosphere explaining more than 21 and 25 of the variance respectively.Furthermore we analyzed the effect of cropping regimes on bacterial and fungal communities in each plant compartment Table 5.

2009.Bacterial and Fungal Communities Are Dominated by a Few PhylaThe response of bacterial and fungal communities of faba bean and wheat toward cropping regimes was assessed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region respectively.

Leaf endophytes were not affected by cropping regime but bacterial and fungal community structures in bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as fungal community structures in roots.

However a direct comparison between endosphere and soil communities should be treated with caution as two different DNA extraction methods were used for endophyte and soil communities.Cropping Regime Influenced Microbial Diversity and RichnessWe compared bacterial as well as fungal richness number of observed OTUs diversity represented by the Shannon index H' and the number of effective species between the four cropping regimes.

In addition they found that the abundance of bacterial community in soil was significantly and negatively related to soil CN ratio which is in contrast to our results.We speculate that the contrasting effects of cropping regimes on microbial diversity observed here and in other studies are related to differences in plant species root exudates plant age and soil type as these factors influence microbial diversity Berg and Smalla 2009 Zhang et al.

Obtained results will further deepen our understanding of how cropping regimes influence the plant microbiome.MATERIALS AND METHODSExperimental DesignTo examine the influence of cropping systems on the entire fungal and bacterial community in soil and endosphere we developed an experimental system to simulate monoculture and two intercropping settings in agriculture.

Bacterial and fungal communities in bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as in aerial plant parts and root endosphere were examined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal internal transcribed spacer ITS region respectively.

There was a marginal effect of cropping regimes on bacterial richness in bulk soil of faba bean samples P  0.062 and on bacterial diversity and the effective number of species in faba bean roots P  0.079.of the relative abundances in sugarcane stalks and belonged to the core microbiome.
