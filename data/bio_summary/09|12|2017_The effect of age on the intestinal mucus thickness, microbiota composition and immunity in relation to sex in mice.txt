as shown in  the colonic mucus layer of old males and females both non-ovx and ovx mice demonstrated many locations where the mucus failed to prevent intestinal microbiota from contact with the epithelium.ageing induced changes in intestinal microbiota composition diversity and richness is influenced by sexas mucus is a substrate for mucolytic bacteria and abnormalities in mucus function are associ- ated with enhanced colonization by pathobionts  we determined the microbial composition in the feces of young and old male and female mice.

although old ovx females tended to have a thicker mucus layer than non-ovx females ovariectomy seemed to have no effect on the mucus properties as in old ovx females no genes related to mucus properties were differently expressed as compared to old non-ovx females.the differences in mucus layer between young and old mice may be related to the observed differences in microbiota composition.

this deteri- oration of mucus may be due to a decreased mucus production such as decreased production of muc1 or by an age dependent decrease in genes involved in mucus biosynthesis such aschst2 chst4 and st3gal4.

additional a decline in mucus thickness may also play a role in the higher sus- ceptibility for rheumatoid arthritis ra in ra susceptible 0401 mice as these mice also showed an altered microbiota composition and had a significantly higher gut permeability as compared to naive mice .apart from the thickness of the mucus layer we also investigated the expression of essential genes involved in goblet cell secretory processes and mucus biosynthesis in both ileum and colonic tissue.

this mucus layer not only prevents inflammation but also plays an essential role in microbiota colonization indicating the complex interplay between mucus composition- microbiota and intestinal health.

also it is not known whether the mucus integrity is involved in the reported gradual deterioration of barrier function in elderly .to gain a better understanding of the influence of age on the dynamic interplay between mucus-microbiota-immune responses and intestinal barrier function we investigated mucus thickness intestinal microbiota composition and immune composition in young 3 months and old 19 months c57b16olahsd b6 mice.

p-values of 0.05 or smaller were considered statistically significant and p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 were defined as a trend.results3.1 aging induced decline in mucus thickness in the colon is not influenced by sexto study the effect of ageing and sex on mucus thickness a pasalcian blue staining  and muc2 immunofluorescent staining  was performed on colon tissue samples fixed in carnoy.

overall in old mice the firm mucus layer was thinner 10 mm than in young mice 20-25 mm and females had a thicker mucus layer than males twa p0.05 .

however the effect of age on the mucus thickness was not different between males and females neither did ovariec- tomy changed the mucus thickness .

an additional group of ovariectomized ovx old females was added and compared with the old females to determine the effect of a loss of female sex hormones human menopause c.ageing induced changes in the expression of genes involved in mucus biosynthesis and immune signaling in the ileum and colon is influenced by sexto determine whether the variation in microbiota composition and mucus thickness between young and old mice and males and females had any effect on gene expression in the intestine we performed a microarray analysis on tissue from the distal ileum and proximal colon.

both old male and old female mice had a decreased mucus thickness in the colon as compared to young mice and contact between the colon epithelium and microbiota was observed at several locations in the old mice illus- trating inadequacies in the barrier function of mucus layer in both sexes in old age.

additionally the change in microbiota composition may be related to the decreased mucus thickness in old mice as for instance bacteriodetes vulgatus has been shown to be able to degrade mucus .

this could include studies measuring the mucus thick- ness at several time-point during the process of ageing to investigate the development of mucus shrinkage.

additionally studying mucus properties in the small intestine would be interesting as this is an important immunological site .differences in mucus thickness and composition as well as differences in the microbiota may induce differences in immune responses.

the decline in mucus thickness with ageing might be explained by downregulation of genes involved in mucus biosynthesis pathways and was associated with a changed microbiota such as a relative high abundance of certain pathobionts and a relative low abundance of more beneficial bacteria strains.
