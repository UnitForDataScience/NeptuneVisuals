Although old ovx females tended to have a thicker mucus layer than non-ovx females ovariectomy seemed to have no effect on the mucus properties as in old ovx females no genes related to mucus properties were differently expressed as compared to old non-ovx females.The differences in mucus layer between young and old mice may be related to the observed differences in microbiota composition.

Both old male and old female mice had a decreased mucus thickness in the colon as compared to young mice and contact between the colon epithelium and microbiota was observed at several locations in the old mice illus- trating inadequacies in the barrier function of mucus layer in both sexes in old age.

As shown in  the colonic mucus layer of old males and females both non-ovx and ovx mice demonstrated many locations where the mucus failed to prevent intestinal microbiota from contact with the epithelium.Ageing induced changes in intestinal microbiota composition diversity and richness is influenced by sexAs mucus is a substrate for mucolytic bacteria and abnormalities in mucus function are associ- ated with enhanced colonization by pathobionts  we determined the microbial composition in the feces of young and old male and female mice.

An additional group of ovariectomized ovx old females was added and compared with the old females with a t-test to determine the effect of a loss of female sex hormones human menopause.present in the Th2 subset old ovx females had a reduced percentage of Th2 cells as compared to old non-ovx females t-test p0.05 .In the spleen old mice had a lower percentage of naive CD4 and CD8 cells than young mice while males had a higher percentage of naive CD4 and CD8 cells than females TWA p0.05 .
