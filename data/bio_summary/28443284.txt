Those who were partially breastfed had similar concentrations of total SCFAs acetate and propionate compared to those not breastfed at the time of fecal metabolite profiling or concentrations fall- ing midway between those not breastfed and those exclusively breastfed seen for butyrate valerate isobutyrate isovalerate and lactate.

These included whether infants had ever been breastfed duration of exclusive breastfeeding never 3 months and 3 monthsand breastfeeding status at the time of fecal sample collectionexclusively breastfed partially breastfed and not breastfed.Mode of birth classified as vaginal elective or emergency cesarean section CS and maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis IAP were extracted from hospital records.

Similar trends were observed when data were restricted to infants who had not started solid foods Table S2 in Supplementary Material and infants vaginally delivered without exposure to IAP Table S4 in Supplementary Material although loss in statistical significance was observed in some instances.The higher relative proportion of acetate seen in exclusively breastfed infants is in contrast to the lower overall concentra- tion of acetate in fecal samples of these infants as illustrated in .Odds of high scFas and intermediate Metabolites according to Breastfeeding adjusted for Birth Mode and iaPExclusively breastfed infants had 86 lower odds of having high absolute concentrations of total SCFAs concentrations greater than the group median compared to those not breastfed at metabolite profiling odds ratio OR 0.14 95 CI 0.06-0.38 .

Similar results were seen in these infants following adjustment for birth mode and IAP as well as age at stool collection sex city of birth maternal education and BMI .Exclusively breastfed infants were seven times more likely to have high concentrations of lactate and partially breastfed infants four times more likely than those not breastfed OR 7.81 95 CI 2.99-20.37 and OR 4.56 95 CI 1.88-11.04 respectively.

Partially breastfed infants but not exclusively breast- fed infants had significantly higher odds of high succinate OR 3.45 95 CI 1.53-7.79.Infants exclusively breastfed were over four times more likely to have high relative proportions of acetate compared to those not breastfed OR 4.26 95 CI 1.76-10.36 .

At fecal sample collection 30 were exclusively breastfed and 42 of infants were partially breastfed.

Total SCFA concentration was 142.0 umolg with the most abundant SCFA being acetate followed by propionate and butyrate.In univariate analysis infants who had ever been breastfed had lower concentrations of total SCFAs acetate butyrate propionate valerate isobutyrate and isovalerate and higher concentrations of lactate and succinate than those who had never been breastfed .

Compared to those not being breastfed at time of fecal metabolite profiling those who were exclusively breastfed had significantly lower total SCFAs concentrations andlower concentrations of all individual SCFAs .

Lactate was significantly higher in those exclusively breastfed versus those not breastfed 7.2 versus 2.3 umolg P  0.001.

Similar differences were observed according to duration of exclusive breastfeeding with those breastfed for 3 months having significantly lower concentrations of SCFAs than infants who had never been breastfed .
