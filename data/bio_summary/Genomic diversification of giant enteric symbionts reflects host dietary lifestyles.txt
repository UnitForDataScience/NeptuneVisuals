Initially the lack of genomes representing diverse Epulopiscium clades in the nonredundant NR protein database downloaded on 2015 June 1 hampered our ability to confidently assign metagenomic genes beyond those that were homologous to the reference draft genome of Epulopiscium spe- cies type B from Naso tonganus 32 that was present in the NR database SI Appendix Fig.

Phylogenetic anchoring was greatly improved when we seeded the NR database with 14 Epulopiscium-like genomes generated in this study see below-- in terms of overall protein alignment 88-95 average amino acid identity 90-91 and the corresponding high number of retrieved homologs SI Appendix Fig.

In the analyzed fishes Epulopiscium-relatedNgugi et al.PNAS  Published online August 23 2017  E7593sequences were found to dominate the prokaryotic coding genes 12-48 of all genes SI Appendix Fig.

Of the CAZymes directly involved in the digestion of polysaccharides we observed that A. sohal had a relatively higher fraction of glycoside hydrolases GHs compared with the Naso species Fig.

Consequently a much richer GH complement was found in A. sohal than in the Nasospecies 3.6 vs. 0.3-1.4 GHsMbp Fig.

2B however the densities of PLs 0.08 vs. 0.04-0.14 PLsMbp and CEs 0.6 vs.0.1-0.9 CEsMbp were within the same range.Overall 52-95 of CAZymes catalyzing the removal of ester substituents from glycan chains by CEs and the cleavage of glycosidic bonds between carbohydrates by GHs were pre- dicted to originate from Epulopiscium Fig.

However only 32 of the predicted GHs are shared among the three fish species Fig.
