statistical analysis determined by 1-way avova tukey's multiple comparison posttest  extremely significant p  0.001 comparing o157h7 to saline and commensal 8.5 hours  very significant p 0.001 to 0.01 comparing o157h7 to saline and commensal 22.5 hours and  significant p  0.05 comparing o157h7 8.5 hours to o157h7 22.5 hours.

less bacterial staining was observed for the commensal e. coli compared to e. coli o157h7 likely due to the use of different bacterial antibodies since demonstrated recovery of the two strains was similar.conclusionscommensal e. coli grew to high numbers in the previously sterile ihio lumen without causing damage demonstrating that like the neonatal intestine the innate defenses of ihios are suffi- cient to contain non-pathogenic bacteria .

closed symbols in a separate experiment ihios were injected with 103 commensal e. coli sguc183 squares or pathogenic o157h7 pt29s triangles as above but at 18 hours the medium was replaced with medium lacking penicillin and bacterial counts were assessed at 27 hours post inoculation.

confocal images of cryosections of ihios stained for nuclear dna blue cd11b red and antibody to e. coli a-e.coli green injected with commensal pathogenic o157h7 or saline respectively 22.5 hours after injection 18.5 hours after addition of pmns.

merged images were generated and the fitc fluores- cence was quantified by using imagej software.growth of e. coli in organoidsfor challenge studies approximately 103 e. coli cells were microinjected into the ihio lumen.

thus the luminal surface of ihios can tolerate high levels of lps but ihios are extremely sensitive to lps introduced from the serosal side.ihios support luminal growth of e. colito assess whether e. coli can replicate and persist in the ihio lumen approximately 103 non- pathogenic commensal strain of e. coli sguc183 or clinical isolate pt29s of o157h7 which only expressed stx2a were microinjected into the ihio lumen under conditions that prevented bacterial growth in the tissue culture medium.

pmidcampellone k. tails of two tirs actin pedestal formation by enteropathogenic e. coli and enterohemor- rhagic e. coli o157h7.

assuming ihios are hol- low spheres about 0.1 cm in diameter radius  0.05 cm the internal volume is equal to 43 pr3 or 5.24 x 10-4 ml for an estimated density of about 1.9 x 1010 bacteria per ml within the range of bacterial density in the human ileum about 108 per ml and colon about 1012 per ml -.at 24 hours commensal e. coli but not pathogenic o157h7 were recovered from the ihios.

cryosections of ihios 18 hours after injection were stained for dna blue bacteria green anti-e. coli for commensal anti-o157 for o157h7 and f-actin red.

at 18 hours post infection  the luminal border was gone f-actin staining was sparse and randomly distributed and the green e-cadherin staining was greatly diminished with no obvious luminal structure.ihios resemble the distal portion of the small intestine  the tissues that are favored for initial attachment of e. coli o157h7 .

rnaseq was performed on ihios at 4 hours post-injection with pbs control or 103 commensal e. coli or o157h7.

significantly more fluorescent signal was detected in the ihios infected with e. coli o157h7 than the saline or commensal-infected ihios at both 8.5 and 22.5 hours .

after about 4 hours much slower doubling times of about 3 hours were observed suggesting changes in the lumen environment such as nutrient or oxygen depletion.

to determine if the inability to recover o157h7 at 24 hours was due to loss of the epithelial barrier and subse- quent exposure to the antibiotics from the tissue culture medium at 18 hours the mediumsensitivity to lps.
