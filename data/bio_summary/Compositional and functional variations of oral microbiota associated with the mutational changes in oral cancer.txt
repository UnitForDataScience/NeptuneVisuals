At the lower taxonomic level the most abundant genera were Streptococcus 16.2 Prevotella 13.4 Neisseria 9.1 and Veillonella 8.9 with lower numbers of Rothia 5.4 and Porphyromonas 4.2.Microbial composition and abundance categorized by the distributions of mutational signatures within OSCCTo explore the potential relationship between bacterial flora of oral cavity and mutational changes in oral cancer we categorized OSCC patients based on the distributions of five mutational signatures ex- tracted from the dataset of somatic variations in the primary tumors of our cohort .

31 OSCC tumors were classified into three groups mutational signature cluster MSC1-3 and a singleton based on the intensity of the mutational signatures operative in each tumor using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering method A. Tumors in the MSC3 group n  11 predominantly presented at the late stage p  .006 and with a greater tumor size p  .021 B.

These find- ings suggest that molecular classification of OSCC according to the in- tensity of mutational patterns in oral cancer reflects clinicopathological parameters and etiological backgrounds.Further analysis of bacterial composition and abundance categor- ized by the distributions of mutational signatures in OSCC revealed that the relative abundance of many taxa at the phylum and genus levels differed among the three MSC groups C D and Fig.

Tumor classification mutational signature cluster MSC based on the contributions of mutational signatures.

We also unraveled that microbial gene pathways were differentially enriched in salivary samples of OSCC patients with distinct mutational profiles.All cancers carry somatic mutations that were accumulated through multiple mutational processes.

Different mutational processes give rise to unique combinations of mutation types termed mutational sig- natures .

These suggest that oral microbiota as an exogenous trigger may be involved in cer- tain mutational processes in oral tumorigenesis ultimately contributing to differential intensities of mutational patterns in oral cancer.

Further predicting the functional capabilities of microbial communities by reconstruction of unobserved states showed that many pathways related to cell motility were differentially enriched among the three MSC groups.Conclusion Collectively these results indicate a potential association of oral microbiome with the mutational changes in OSCC.IntroductionOral cancer is a prevalent malignancy globally with a huge majority 90 of cases being oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC .

However at present little is known regarding the relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational changes in OSCC.
