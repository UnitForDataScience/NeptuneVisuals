31 oscc tumors were classified into three groups mutational signature cluster msc1-3 and a singleton based on the intensity of the mutational signatures operative in each tumor using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering method a. tumors in the msc3 group n  11 predominantly presented at the late stage p  .006 and with a greater tumor size p  .021 b. the proportion of patients with a history of smoking in msc3 was lower than that for the other groups p  .021. the msc1 group n  9 wascharacterized by frequent tp53 mutations p  .021. in addition the msc2 group n  10 exhibited a late histological stage p  .017 andwas associated with recurrent mutations in key driver genes fat1 fzr1 and axin1 related to the wnt pathway p  .032. these find- ings suggest that molecular classification of oscc according to the in- tensity of mutational patterns in oral cancer reflects clinicopathological parameters and etiological backgrounds.further analysis of bacterial composition and abundance categor- ized by the distributions of mutational signatures in oscc revealed that the relative abundance of many taxa at the phylum and genus levels differed among the three msc groups c d and fig.

our results together with findings from others implicate a usefulness of oral mi- crobiota in not only characterization of oscc etiology but also strati- fication of oscc patients with differential therapeutic efficacy.previous investigations showed changes in alpha and beta diversityof bacterial communities between salivary specimens of oscc patientsand that from control subjects  whereas the bacterial di- versity of tissue biopsy or swab samples between oscc and controls remained similar .

at the lower taxonomic level the most abundant genera were streptococcus 16.2 prevotella 13.4 neisseria 9.1 and veillonella 8.9 with lower numbers of rothia 5.4 and porphyromonas 4.2.microbial composition and abundance categorized by the distributions of mutational signatures within osccto explore the potential relationship between bacterial flora of oral cavity and mutational changes in oral cancer we categorized oscc patients based on the distributions of five mutational signatures ex- tracted from the dataset of somatic variations in the primary tumors of our cohort .

we also unraveled that microbial gene pathways were differentially enriched in salivary samples of oscc patients with distinct mutational profiles.all cancers carry somatic mutations that were accumulated through multiple mutational processes.

the culture-independent creature of this approach does not rule out species that are difficult to grow or currently un- cultivated and its open-ended and highly sensitive nature potentiates the discovery of new taxa of low abundance that are likely associated with oral cancer.recent studies using the small subunit ribosomal rna 16s rrnagene sequence in culture-free settings have compared the microbial communities present in oral cancer versus anatomically matched normal tissues oscc biopsies versus deep-epithelium swabs from matched control subjects and saliva samples from oscc patients with different statuses of hpv positivity and treatment .

on the contrary samples in the msc1 group had significant enrichment for phylum actinobacteria class actinobacteria and order actinomycetales as compared with those in themsc2 group.diversity of microbiota associated with molecular oscc subgroupsin addition to changes in relative abundance of different taxa we also evaluated alterations in microbial diversity among three molecular oscc subgroups.

these restate a role of oral microbiota in regulating cancer-related inflammation and connect genetic varia- tions of oscc to oral flora-mediated immunity.to explore the relationship between oral microorganisms and thegenomic landscapes of oscc additional work is needed to addressfig.

further predicting the functional capabilities of microbial communities by reconstruction of unobserved states showed that many pathways related to cell motility were differentially enriched among the three msc groups.conclusion collectively these results indicate a potential association of oral microbiome with the mutational changes in oscc.introductionoral cancer is a prevalent malignancy globally with a huge majority 90 of cases being oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc .

however at present little is known regarding the relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational changes in oscc.

using whole-exome sequencing we have previously characterized the mutational catalog of oral cancer and provided clues for a molecular-based classification of oscc patients with prognostic and therapeutic implications .

in this study we analyzed the composition of oral microorganisms in oscc patients with different mutational profiles to evaluate the potential association between the microbial flora of oral cavity and genomic alterations of oral cancer.materials and methodssubject enrollment and sample collectionthe subjects were recruited from 2014 to 2015 with the approval by the institutional review board of chung shan medical university hospital taichung taiwan.

moreover analyses of sample-to-sample dissimilarities in bacterial community structures beta diversity demonstrated a slight discrimination among three msc groups especially between msc2 and msc3 but not be- tween tumors positive and negative for tp53 mutations .functional prediction of bacterial communities related to mutational changes in osccto gain an insight into the functionality of oral microbiota in oscc biology we inferred the functional profile of microbial communities by phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved states picrust .
