The habitats of domestic waterfowl overlap those of the hooded cranes at Shengjin Lake and large aggregations of migratory birds may represent a source of pathogenic microbes that can be transmitted through feces.5  CONCLUSIONS This study first identified the gut microbiome of hooded cranes and defines the core gut microbiome of hooded cranes wintering at Shengjin Lake.

And the heatmap Figure 4 of the frequen- cies of the genera reveals three distinct groups comprising samples B C D H and J F and G A E I M N K L and O respectively.3.3  Core gut microbiomeAnalysis of the frequencies of genera revealed that 37 genera were pre- sent in 90 of the samples and 26 genera were present in all samplessuggesting that approximately 12 of the genera were consistently pre- sent among most of the hooded cranes sampled and that 9 were present at varying levels in all samples.

The core fecal microbiome of the hooded cranes was assigned if it comprised 90 of samples and represented 0.1 of the reads.3  RESULTS  Barcoded 16S pyrosequencingWe acquired 503398 valid reads from the 15 fecal samples and among them 96.5 average were classified as bacterial phyla 3.5 could not be classified and 90 were assigned to the levels of phylum class and order.

This maybe because Shengjin Lake provides wintering hooded cranes with an abundant and diverse source of food.The most abundant phyla of gut microbes of wintering hooded cranes were as follows Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.

Peptostreptococcaceae genera M  13.5 were not identified at genus level.4  DISCUSSION The present study is the first to describe the gut microbiome of hooded cranes wintering at Shengjin Lake.

The microbial composition of the gut of the hooded cranes may be related to their diet acquired from their major foraging habitats such as paddy fields and meadows Zheng et al.
