the habitats of domestic waterfowl overlap those of the hooded cranes at shengjin lake and large aggregations of migratory birds may represent a source of pathogenic microbes that can be transmitted through feces.5  conclusions this study first identified the gut microbiome of hooded cranes and defines the core gut microbiome of hooded cranes wintering at shengjin lake.

peptostreptococcaceae incertae sedis was the most abundant division m  13.5 followed by chloroplast norank m  13.3. the first and second most fre- quent genera among the 15 samples were clostridium m  9.8 and lysinibacillus m  6.4. and the heatmap figure 4 of the frequen- cies of the genera reveals three distinct groups comprising samples b c d h and j f and g a e i m n k l and o respectively.3.3  core gut microbiomeanalysis of the frequencies of genera revealed that 37 genera were pre- sent in 90 of the samples and 26 genera were present in all samplessuggesting that approximately 12 of the genera were consistently pre- sent among most of the hooded cranes sampled and that 9 were present at varying levels in all samples.

2014. this maybe because shengjin lake provides wintering hooded cranes with an abundant and diverse source of food.the most abundant phyla of gut microbes of wintering hooded cranes were as follows firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria.

2008 to collect 15 fecal samples from hooded cranes wintering at shengjin lake south bank of the yangtze river hefei china 30.25deg-30.50degn 116.92deg- 117.25dege during the wintering period and make sure that the fecal samples were only from the cranes.

because the gut microbiome serves as an im- portant indicator of lifestyle and health it is important to charac- terize the gut microbiome of hooded cranes to contribute to efforts to conserve this endangered species.

2013. the core fecal microbiome of the hooded cranes was assigned if it comprised 90 of samples and represented 0.1 of the reads.3  results  barcoded 16s pyrosequencingwe acquired 503398 valid reads from the 15 fecal samples and among them 96.5 average were classified as bacterial phyla 3.5 could not be classified and 90 were assigned to the levels of phylum class and order.

2004. further studies are required to simultaneously test and verify the diet of the host as one of the factors that influence the composition of the gut microbiota as well as studies to determine the functions of the core gut microbiome to better understand the diet and health of the hooded cranes that win- ter at shengjin lake.we detected many potential pathogenic bacteria.

before the samples were col- lected we used binoculars or telescopes to observe the foraging areas of the cranes select large groups with more than 50 individuals and insure the absence of other cranes or geese within the range of about 50 m in the foraging areas of the cranes.

excluding genera present at 0.1 of the total reads 20 genera were present in all samples and 6 genera were pre- sent in 14 samples tables 2 and 3. therefore 9 of the gut microbiome formed the core microbiome of 90 samples.

2010. however the gut microbiome of hooded cranes is unknown.

therefore we use multiplex pyrosequencing to identify the species that populate the gut micro- biome of wintering hooded cranes in this study.2  materials and methods  fecal sample collectionwe used noninvasive techniques darimont et al.

peptostreptococcaceae genera m  13.5 were not identified at genus level.4  discussion the present study is the first to describe the gut microbiome of hooded cranes wintering at shengjin lake.

the microbial composition of the gut of the hooded cranes may be related to their diet acquired from their major foraging habitats such as paddy fields and meadows zheng et al.

in addition some sequences were classified as chloroplast norank becausethey likely represent ingested plant material.we show here that 9 of the genera formed the core gut micro- biome of hooded cranes.
