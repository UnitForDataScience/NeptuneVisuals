several studies show that stool metabolites enhance contractile responses of intestinal smooth muscle and neuronal excitability of the enteric nervous system resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea fecal urgency and sense of incomplete emptying that are common in women with fi.4-5 given that stool metabolites and microbiota are potentially modifiable understanding the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of fi could provide a paradigm change to its management.corresponding author lily a. arya department of obgyn hospital of university of pennsylvania 3400 spruce street philadelphia pa disclaimers nonecontributions all authors have contributed substantially to conception and study design b. drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content c. final approval of the version to be publishedcontribution dr. arya has drafted and written this paper.

similarly ba producing bacteria such as the leptum group have been noted to be elevated and correlated with stool consistency and primary bile acid levels in subjects with ibs-diarrhea.20 analysis of subgroups in patients with ibs has shown microbial associations with colonic transit time rectal sensation bloating and depression suggesting that certain bacterial phylotypes were clinical markers of ibs.10 given the potential role of gut motility and rectal sensation in the pathogenesis of fi analysis of microbiota in women with fi compared to healthy controls may allow identification of subgroups of patients who are characterized by abnormal microbiota andor metabolites.though the above discussion provides biologically plausible evidence that stool metabolites modulate gut motility and sensation direct evidence on the role of stool metabolites and microbiota in women with fi is lacking.

conditions known to be associated with abnormal stool metabolites and microbiota such as inflammatory bowel disease and recent antibiotic use are also being excluded.the primary aim of smm-capable is to compare baseline levels of metabolites in stool samples of women with fi from capable to unaffected similarly aged controls.

the gut microbiome of patients with ibs patients is often dominated by firmicutes the phylum from which the above decaroboxylase containing bacteria are derived.10 since tryptamine levels could potentially be modulated by probiotics or dietary changes measurement of tryptamine levels or of bacteria that generate tryptamine in the stools of women with fi could identify subgroups of patients who benefit from such treatments.stool microbiotasince the metabolites of many microbiota have not been identified direct measurement of stool microbiota could also advance our understanding of bowel disturbances in women with fi.

in healthy adults 80 of the identified fecal microbiota can be classified into three dominant phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria but there is substantial variation in species among individuals.10 in humans butyrate producing bacteria are elevated in functional disorders associated with fecal urgency and increased motility.

stool samples are being analyzed for metabolites using targeted metabolite profiling of fecal water.

obstetric sphincter injury interacts with diarrhea and urgency to increase the risk of fecal incontinence in women with irritable bowel syndrome.

bowel disturbances are the most important risk factors for late onset fecal incontinence a population-based case-control study in women.

smm-capable will also explore if levels of stool metabolites or microbiota can predict response to treatments being tested in capable such as loperamide and anorectal biofeedback.all women cases and controls participating in smm-capable contributed a stool specimen at baseline and at the end of 24 weeks of treatment.

the planned sample size based on reported levels of butyrate in stool of human controls is 82 cases and 41 unaffected controls.in sections below we present our rationale for measuring specific metabolites and microbiota in the stool of women with fi.butyrateseveral animal and human studies show that butyrate has an important role in gut motility and gut sensation and are discussed below.

the introduction of bas directly into the sigmoid colon and rectum has been shown to cause diarrhea by a variety of mechanisms including stimulating colonic motility activating intracellular secretory mechanisms and increasing mucosal permeability.18 shin et al reported higher levels of individual primary and secondary but not total bas in the stool of subjects with ibs-diarrhea and ibs-constipation respectively thus demonstrating the utility of measuring ba profile in subjects with unexplained functional diarrhea or constipation.15 these studies suggest that similar measurements of ba profile in the stool of women with fi could advance our understanding of factors that contribute to the severity of fi and potentially identify subgroups of women who may benefit from ba sequestering treatments.tryptaminetryptamine is a powerful neuroactive metabolite that is derived from the decarboxylation of dietary tryptophan by decarboxylase enzymes contained in gut bacteria.19 tryptamine mimics the effects of serotonin on gut motility and gut neurons through the endogenous release of physiologically active serotonin or 5-ht.

the smm-capable study will measure both stool metabolome metabolites resulting from host-microbiota interaction and stool microbiome gut bacterial environment in women with fi compared to similarly aged controls.

specific metabolites andor microbiota could serve as clinical biomarkers for fi subgroups and identify potential new targeted treatments for women with this debilitating condition.acknowledgmentsthe author thanks holly e. richter phd.
