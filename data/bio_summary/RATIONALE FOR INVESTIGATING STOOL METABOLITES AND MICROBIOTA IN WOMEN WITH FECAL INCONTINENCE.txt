Arya MD MS for the Pelvic Floor Disorders NetworkProfessor of Obstetrics and Gynecology University of PennsylvaniaKeywordsStool microbiota stool metabolites fecal incontinence butyrate bile acids fecal urgencyIntroductionChildbirth and its associated neuromuscular injury to the anal sphincter muscles have traditionally been considered as a common cause of fecal incontinence FI in women.1 However the onset of FI is usually after age 50 which is remote from delivery.2 Recent large epidemiologic studies report that bowel symptoms related to gut motility and sensation such as diarrhea and fecal urgency are significant contributing factors that are more important than obstetric factors in the pathogenesis of FI.1-3 In these studies examining the association of multiple demographic obstetric and gastrointestinal risk factors for FI the number of fecal urgency episodes per month and diarrhea emerged as risk factors that were most closely associated with FI.1-3 Therefore investigating mechanisms that worsen fecal urgency and diarrhea could advance our understanding of factors that modulate the severity of FI and its response to treatment.Stool metabolites produced by the interaction of gut microbiota with the host can modulate neuro-hormonal mechanisms implicated in gut motility and gut sensation.

Similarly BA producing bacteria such as the Leptum group have been noted to be elevated and correlated with stool consistency and primary bile acid levels in subjects with IBS-Diarrhea.20 Analysis of subgroups in patients with IBS has shown microbial associations with colonic transit time rectal sensation bloating and depression suggesting that certain bacterial phylotypes were clinical markers of IBS.10 Given the potential role of gut motility and rectal sensation in the pathogenesis of FI analysis of microbiota in women with FI compared to healthy controls may allow identification of subgroups of patients who are characterized by abnormal microbiota andor metabolites.Though the above discussion provides biologically plausible evidence that stool metabolites modulate gut motility and sensation direct evidence on the role of stool metabolites and microbiota in women with FI is lacking.

Several studies show that stool metabolites enhance contractile responses of intestinal smooth muscle and neuronal excitability of the enteric nervous system resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea fecal urgency and sense of incomplete emptying that are common in women with FI.4-5 Given that stool metabolites and microbiota are potentially modifiable understanding the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of FI could provide a paradigm change to its management.Corresponding Author Lily A.

The introduction of BAs directly into the sigmoid colon and rectum has been shown to cause diarrhea by a variety of mechanisms including stimulating colonic motility activating intracellular secretory mechanisms and increasing mucosal permeability.18 Shin et al reported higher levels of individual primary and secondary but not total BAs in the stool of subjects with IBS-Diarrhea and IBS-Constipation respectively thus demonstrating the utility of measuring BA profile in subjects with unexplained functional diarrhea or constipation.15 These studies suggest that similar measurements of BA profile in the stool of women with FI could advance our understanding of factors that contribute to the severity of FI and potentially identify subgroups of women who may benefit from BA sequestering treatments.TryptamineTryptamine is a powerful neuroactive metabolite that is derived from the decarboxylation of dietary tryptophan by decarboxylase enzymes contained in gut bacteria.19 Tryptamine mimics the effects of serotonin on gut motility and gut neurons through the endogenous release of physiologically active serotonin or 5-HT.

In healthy adults 80 of the identified fecal microbiota can be classified into three dominant phyla Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria but there is substantial variation in species among individuals.10 In humans butyrate producing bacteria are elevated in functional disorders associated with fecal urgency and increased motility.

Conditions known to be associated with abnormal stool metabolites and microbiota such as inflammatory bowel disease and recent antibiotic use are also being excluded.The primary aim of SMM-CAPABLe is to compare baseline levels of metabolites in stool samples of women with FI from CAPABLE to unaffected similarly aged controls.

Experimental intraluminal administration of butyrate stimulates high amplitude propulsive contractions as well as colonic transit and in both rats and humans.6-9 In patients with irritable bowel syndrome IBS higher levels of butyrate have been associated with increased motility and diarrhea while lower levels are associated with reduced motility and constipation.10-11 The mechanism through which butyrate stimulates gut motility has also been elucidated.

The planned sample size based on reported levels of butyrate in stool of human controls is 82 cases and 41 unaffected controls.In sections below we present our rationale for measuring specific metabolites and microbiota in the stool of women with FI.ButyrateSeveral animal and human studies show that butyrate has an important role in gut motility and gut sensation and are discussed below.

The gut microbiome of patients with IBS patients is often dominated by Firmicutes the phylum from which the above decaroboxylase containing bacteria are derived.10 Since tryptamine levels could potentially be modulated by probiotics or dietary changes measurement of tryptamine levels or of bacteria that generate tryptamine in the stools of women with FI could identify subgroups of patients who benefit from such treatments.Stool MicrobiotaSince the metabolites of many microbiota have not been identified direct measurement of stool microbiota could also advance our understanding of bowel disturbances in women with FI.

Stool samples are being analyzed for metabolites using targeted metabolite profiling of fecal water.
