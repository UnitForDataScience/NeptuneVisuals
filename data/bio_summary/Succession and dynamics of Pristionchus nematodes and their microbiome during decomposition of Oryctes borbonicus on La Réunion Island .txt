While most beetle associated samples including nematode samples from both years form one large cluster almost all outlier sam- ples are of soil origin suggesting higher variability in soil samples Fig.

We therefore conclude that i the nematode community on the decaying beetle differs strongly from the soil nematode community and ii the arrested dauer stage of Pristion- chus and Oscheius is the primary source for the reproducing nematodes on the beetle carcass.Abiotic factors of decaying beetle specimensAs abiotic factors are known to influence the dynamics of the decay of biological samples as well as the composition of bacterial communities in decaying matter Lauber et al.

1E to analyse soil nematode com- munity and the soil pH.Beetle samples were recovered after 0 36 h and 4 7 8 9 10 and 11 days.

These samples were collected from five environments the native soil at the sam- ple site n 5 20 the soil surrounding decaying beetles n 5 26 the decaying beetles n 5 25 single worms of the five different nematode species occurring on the carcasses n 5 327 and the beetle gut of O. borbonicus n 5 36.

Soil nematode community nematode succession and interspecific competition of nematodes.Composition of the soil nematode community determined by 18S RNA sequencing and the feeding strategy of the resulting species.

The decaying beetle is distinct from the other habitats.Number of families with significant changes in relative abundance between the different environments.Number of significantly different families between samples of various nematode species.Heat map showing all significantly different bacterial families between the beetle gut samples blue and decaying beetle samples grey and their relative abundances in all beetle gut and decaying beetle samples.which make up more than 50 of the complete metage- nome in decaying beetles compared with less than 20 in living beetles Supporting Information Fig.

Similar to the observation that soil and decaying soil seem to be less stable environments than beetle-associated environments we observed that the presence of the phyla Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia distinguishes both soil environments from all three beetle associated environments Kruskal-Wallis-Tukey P  0.001Fig.

In a poly- merase chain reaction PCR experiment we amplified this region from 1 ll of the extracted DNA soil nematodes and nematodes from the decaying beetle using the primers SSU 18A and SSU 26R.SSU 18A AAAGATTAAGCCATGCATGSSU 26R CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG Blaxter et al.

Raw reads for all samples have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive.Determination of soil temperatureTemperature in the soil were measured using TermochronVR iButtonVR .

In 2015 the soil samples were composed of bacterivorous nematodes i.e.
