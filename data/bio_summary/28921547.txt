similarly it has been found that rats exposed to hydrogen peroxide showed a reduction in bacterial plaque.1213 thus considering the continuous libera- tion of peroxide by whitening products a change in the existing biological balance in the oral cavity may occur.the use of hydrogen peroxide preparations for decreasing plaque and improving oral health in patients is not unprecedented.14 since the 1970s15 carbamide peroxide has been reported as effective in improving gingival health and decreasing the amounts of plaque and calculus deposits.

it is possible that the significant decrease of the population of s. mutansin patients treated with hp may be due to the higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide 6 contained in this gel as compared with cp a 10 carbamide peroxide-based product which slowly dissociates into urea and only 3 hydrogen peroxide.23the analyses carried out on the saliva and perioral areas during whitening showed that the action of these two studied whitening products was negligible because the contact of the whitening gel is limited to the tooth surface due to the bleaching trays and there is less avail- able whitening product in these locations.1922 these results corroborate those reported by an in vivo study of alkmin et al.19 and can be explained by the pres- ence of salivary lactoperoxidase an oral enzyme that catalyzes the reaction between the thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide producing hypothiocyanite that it is less toxic to the bacteria protecting the s. mutans from the peroxide action.1724on the other hand when comparing the population before and 30 days after treatment there were no changes for all sites analysed regardless of the whitening gel used which led us to reject the second hypothesis.thus it can be considered that the whitening treat- ment does not permanently influence the population of s. mutans in the evaluated areas.

the microbiological evaluation was made using conventional and molecular methods.results student's t-test demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in s. mutans population in the subgingival and supragingival plaque for hp samples between t1 and t2 no difference was found between t1 and t3 regardless of the location and the whitening product used a  0.05.conclusions although hp reduced s. mutans during treatment the levels returned to baseline when assessed 30 days after the treatment.keywords dental whitening microbiota peroxides saliva streptococcus mutans.abbreviations and acronyms pcr  polymerase chain reaction.accepted for publication 12 september 2017.introductiontooth whitening with peroxide has been used for over 100 years but after the development of the at-home technique its popularity has increased it is currently one of the most requested aesthetic procedures in the dental office.1in at-home whitening treatment gels containing carbamide peroxide are placed in individual acetate trays and they remain in contact with the dental tis- sues.

thus the purpose of the present clinical randomized study was to evaluate the influence of at-home whitening treatment on streptococcus mutans in saliva buccal mucosa and subgingival and supragingival plaque.methods thirty volunteers were randomly divided into two study groups n  15 according to the whitening therapy g cp whitening using 10 carbamide peroxide 4 h daily for 21 days and g hp whitening using 6 hydrogen perox- ide 1.5 h daily for 21 days.

the whitening product dissociates into urea and hydrogen peroxide which react with substances that are weakly bound to the dental substrate and achieve molecular stability.

this oxidation phenomenon changes the configuration of the molecules responsible for the pigmentation of teeth into smaller compounds making them clear.2the at-home technique has been considered safe and effective as long as it is supervised by a qualified professional.13-5 therefore it has been considered the gold standard in several studies on the effectiveness of whitening therapies.34 currently at-home whitening is performed with carbamide peroxide gels between 10 and 16 or even hydrogen peroxide-based products at concentrations ranging 3-8.6however it has been reported that substances used in whitening therapy can modify the superficial charac- teristics of dental enamel.78 whitening could leave this substrate more susceptible to bacterial adhesion9 while also chemically altering the membrane-binding sites of these surfaces which would improve the adherence of some microorganisms to the bleached enamel.10on the other hand al-qunaian11 showed less susceptibility to the development of new enamel carieslesions.

later it was reported that there was some improvement in oral health resulting from this solution's release of oxygen that had an antibacterial effect and mechanical action on plaque and debris.16additionally the 10 carbamide peroxide buffer- ing effect is responsible for inhibiting bacterial growth and bacterial cell death such as streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in vitro and also reducing levels of salivary lactobacillus in vivo as it modifies plaque and salivary ph due to the ammonia resulting from its degradation.1417besides the antibacterial and anticaries properties peroxides have a beneficial effect on gingival health.

proposed mechanisms of action have included alter- ation of plaque microflora debridement properties of peroxide and increased availability of oxygen to pro- mote tissue healing.14other studies evaluating the effect of whitening on oral microbiota show that there is little or no change in the population of cariogenic bacteria over a short period of time.1819 however these studies are limited to a short period of analysis20 or they have used only one whitening product.18thus the purpose of this clinical study was to eval- uate the influence of at-home whitening therapy ons.

patients from the hp group received at-home whitening treatment using 6 hydrogen peroxide ph  6.0 whiteness class fgm joinville as described above for 1.5 h daily over 21 days.

a statistically signifi- cant reduction in the population of s. mutans in the sub- and supragingival regions was observed at t2 for hp whitening with 6 hydrogen peroxide table 1.on the other hand no change in these areas was observed when whitening was performed withtable 1. p-values for comparison between evaluation times 1 and 2 considering colony count data in the different sites and study groupsg hp0.104 0.0390.0190.108dna polymerase perkin-elmer foster city ca usa 5 ll 109 pcr buffer plus 3 mmoll of mgcl20.25 mmoll of the specific primer for s. mutans and0.2 mmoll deoxynucleoside triphosphates.

this result led us to reject the first null hypothesis.the reduction in the population of these microor- ganisms can be explained by the characteristics of the antimicrobial active agent in whitening products.410 hydrogen peroxide permeates the cell and inhibits the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by the glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways by causing damage to the cellular dna structure cell damage and conse- quently death.21a significant reduction in bacterial population at these sites may be related to the direct contact of whitening gel in these regions.1922 it is worth noting that the individual not scalloped trays used during the at-home whitening technique cause the gel to extend to the free marginal gingiva enabling a leakage of the material into the subgingival region.

these results are consistent with previous findings that did not observe any influence of the whitening agent after treatment.25 similarly zheng et al.18 observed that the antibacte- rial effect of hydrogen peroxide has a short effect acting only during the release of oxygen and that changes are not observed over time after the whitening procedure.thus according to the data obtained in this clinical study it can be stated that even if there is an increase in surface roughness of enamel caused by the whiten- ing agent a reduction of s. mutans population may occur depending on the whitening product used.

in addition it is noteworthy that these changes are not cause for concern to the clinician because they are characterized by a reduction and not by an increase in the population of these microorganisms in the oral environment.conclusionsaccording to the results of this study it can be con- cluded thatthe hydrogen peroxide base product changed the population of s. mutans during whitening in sub- and supragingival regions.no whitening product changed the population levels of s. mutans after the end of treatment.the antimicrobial effect of whitening agents is lim- ited to the treatment period and the product contact area.acknowledgementsthe authors acknowledge fapesp for financial sup- port grant no.
