We hypoth- esized that melatonin would have beneficial effects in wean- ling mice through regulating the intestinal microbiota.MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strainseral gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syn- drome IBS Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis necrotizing enterocolitis and injuries.10-13 Intestinal microbiota are found in virtually every metazoan from invertebrates to vertebrates and the gut microbiota affects numerous physiological func- tions of the intestine14-17 and is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases141618-20 through the activity of the microbiome or its metabolic products.1421Whether melatonin regulates intestinal physiology and the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases through intestinal micro- biota is unknown.

Previous compelling investigations have demonstrated that melatonin influences the swarming and motility of Enterobacter aerogenes22 the richness and diver- sity of mouse intestinal microbiota the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes as well as the abundance of Akkermansia.23 Although these results strongly indicate a link between mel- atonin and intestinal microbiota the exact involvement of in- testinal microbiota in the regulatory functions of melatonin in intestinal physiology and diseases remains to be explored.Weaning is a highly stressful event because mammals at this time experience significant alterations of intestinal morphology eg villus atrophy and physiological functions eg decreased passive maternal immunity and a shift in in- testinal microbiome eg increased potential pathogens be- cause of changes in diet eg transition from a high milk diet to an exclusively solid diet and social and environmental life conditions eg separation from the mother handling transport and mixing litters.24-27 In our previous study we found that weaning in piglets induces a reduction in villus height in the ileum and a decrease in ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the jejunum and ileum especially at 3 days postweaning.28 During the sucking period the consump- tion of the mother's milk provides a nutritional environ- ment for the population of lactic acid bacteria meanwhile Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp.

Collectively mela- tonin alleviates the weanling stress in mice through intestinal microbiota.Melatonin supplementation decreases ETEC infection in weanling mice dependent on intestinal microbiotaWe then explored the effects of melatonin in intestinal in- fection in weanling mice using ETEC-infected model whichFIGURE 5Melatonin failed to improve the weight gain without intestinal microbiota.

Together melatonin inhibits ETEC colonization in the jeju- num in weanling mice but fails to do so in antibiotic-treated weanling mice.DISCUSSION Melatonin affects a variety of molecular pathways includ- ing sleep circadian rhythms sexual behavior immune function apoptosis proliferation metastasis angiogenesis and oxidative stress.1-4 Melatonin also highly shapes the physiological functions and the pathogenesis of diseases in various organs including brain42 heart43 liver4445 lung46 kidney47 and gastrointestinal tract.712 Besides independ- ent roles in gastrointestinal tract the intestinal microbiota also influences numerous biological functions of other or- gans and is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases in these organs.48-50 Although previous investigations have reported that melatonin influences the intestinal microbi- ota including the swarming and motility of Enterobacter aerogenes22 the richness and diversity of mouse intestinal microbiota the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and the abundance of Akkermansia23 whether melatonin shapes the biological functions and the pathogenesis of various diseases in these organs through intestinal microbiota has yet to be investigated.FIGURE 6Melatonin affected ETEC infection in weanling mice.

In conclusion melatonin affects body weight gain intestinal morphology and intestinal ETEC infection through intestinal microbiota in wean- ling mice.

Melatonin supplementa- tion in weanling mice provided in the drinking water at a dosage of 0.2 mgmL for 2 weeks significantly improved body weight gain 1.4 - 0.03 gday in melatonin group vs 1.2 - 0.06 gday in control group and intestinal morphology ie villus length crypt depth and villus to crypt ratio but had little effect on the proliferation or apoptosis of intestinal cells the numbers of Paneth cells and goblet cells as well as the expression of makers related to enterocytes sucrase and endocrine cells chromogranin A and peptide YY in the ileum.

16S rRNA sequencing suggested that melatonin supplementation increased the richness indices of intestinal microbiota observed species Chao 1 and ACE and shaped the composition of intestinal microbiota eg increase in the abun- dance of Lactobacillus 19 - 3 in melatonin group vs 6 - 2 in control group which was demonstrated using an ex vivo proliferation assay and colonic loop pro- liferation assay.

The findings highlight the importance of intestinal microbiota in mediat- ing the various physiological functions of melatonin in the host.KEYWORDS enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli intestinal microbiota Lactobacillus melatonin weanling stressJ.
