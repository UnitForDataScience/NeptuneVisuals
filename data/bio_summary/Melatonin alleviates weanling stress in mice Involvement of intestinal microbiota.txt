mice used in our study were icr mice at 3 weeks of age with basal diet while xu et al23 used 10-week-old c57bl6j mice fed a hfd.23 these differences ie genetic background age and diet highly shape the composition of intestinal microbiota.2351 importantly melatonin increases the relative abundance of lactobacillus and reduces the relative abundance of prevotellaceae in weanling mice.

collectively mela- tonin alleviates the weanling stress in mice through intestinal microbiota.melatonin supplementation decreases etec infection in weanling mice dependent on intestinal microbiotawe then explored the effects of melatonin in intestinal in- fection in weanling mice using etec-infected model whichfigure 5melatonin failed to improve the weight gain without intestinal microbiota.

similar observations have been reported in other models such as rats with chronic fluoxetine an antidepressant drug treatment61 rats with ovariectomy.62 however melatonin shows little effect on the body weight gain in normal mice63 or mice exposed to chronic mild stress63 and even decreases the body weight of mice with high fats diet.23 these results indicate that the effect of melatonin on body weight depends the physiological or pathological situation.in conclusion melatonin supplementation significantly alleviates weanling stress in mice including the increase in weight gain and the improvement in the intestinal mor- phology as well as the decrease in etec colonization.

more importantly in antibiotic-treated weanling mice and germ-free weanling mice melatonin failed to affect body weight gain or intestinal morphology.

for example melatonin influences the permeabil- ity67 energy utilization8 motility9 bicarbonate secretion79 and tight junction9 of intestinal epithelium and alleviates sev-herein we explored the protective roles of melatonin in mice suffering from weanling stress and also investigated the influence of melatonin on intestinal microbiota and the metabolism of the microbiota in weanling mice.

germ-free mice were generated and provided by prof. hong wei from third military medical university chongqing china these mice were maintained in sterile trexler-type isolators.

after 2 weeks of melatonin supple- mentation mice were sacrificed at 0900 hours to collect the duodenum jejunum and ileum after the mice were eutha- nized with co2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocationto ensure death.

after 2 weeks of supplementation mice were infected with etec based on the previous studies.21 at 3 days postinfection mice were sacrificed at 0900 hours to collect the jejunum for further analyses.

there was no significant alteration in protein abundance of caspase-9 cleaved caspase-8 or cleaved caspase-3 between melatonin-supplemented mice and mice without melatonin supplementation fig.

the fecal microbiota of mice with melatonin supplementation had similar overall diversity with control mice as measured by the shannon table 1 and simpson diversity indices table 1. in contrast to the diver- sity indices however there were significant differences intable 1pyrosequencing data and diversity indices of the intestinal microbiota of micethe coverage percentage richness estimators os ace and chao and diversity indices shannon and simpson were calculated using the mothur program.

melatonin-treated mel mice received melatonin in drinking water for 2 week while mice in control con group were given normal drinking water n  8. data mean - sd were analyzed by unpaired t test p  .0001.the richness indices chao 1 ace and observed species be- tween the 2 groups table 1. these indices showed that mela- tonin significantly p  .0001 increased the richness of fecal microbiota table 1. the rarefaction curves showed that the total richness of the microbial community had been sampled completely fig.
