Nostoc Tolypothrix Leptolyng- bya and diatoms through plastid 16S rRNA sequences grew in samples cultivated in the greenhouse whereas their relative abundances were not so important in the initial biocrust especially in FB J and BB sites .DISCUSSIONOur work clearly shows that it is feasible to produce large amounts of biocrust biomass from low levels of natural inoculum within relatively short incubation times by using controlled but seminatural greenhouse facilities biocrust nurseries.

When using open-air facilities the production of inoculum with a high content on nonterrestrial water or airborne contaminant phototrophs is virtually unavoidable making it necessary to i restrict the growth of airborne noncrust cyanobacteria by imposing recurrent desic- cation and ii carry out microbiological quality control monitoring of the microbial composition of the products.We present here an alternative approach to the production of biocrust inoculum that is based on the enhancement of natural populations of remnant biocrust organ- isms on native soils in controlled but seminatural greenhouse facilities biocrust nurseries.

This makes physiological sense in that photosynthetic microorganisms in these assemblages respond rapidly to hydration  but require sufficiently long periods of hydration to turn on the specific sets of genes involved in nutrient uptake chl a and ATP synthesis as well as DNA repair after drought episodes  before net growth canTABLE 2 Summary statistics of null models calculated with randomized microbial community data of bacterial phyla and cyanobacteria to assess the similarity between inoculum and nursery-reared biocrusts during the optimized second set of experiments according to siteaaBC Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index as an estimate of community composition shift based on bacterial phyla and cyanobacteria SES standardized effect size.FIG 6 Endpoint cyanobacterial community composition by clades at the end of the greenhouse incubation period for the second set of experiments that were optimized according to previous results versus that obtained for the field biocrusts used as inoculum.

Seven 0.4-cm-diameter cores of biocrust 1 cm deep were randomly taken in each replicate or field biocrust sample mixed and extracted in 95 ethanol at 4degC in the dark for 24 h. Extracts were then centrifuged 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4degC and chl a concentrations were quantified according to references and in a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectropho- tometer Shimadzu Corporation Kyoto Japan.To determine the microbial community structure of biocrust samples we used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

In some treatments relatively minor components of the biocrust microbial community become important as is the case in FB J and BB samples where we observed a high relative abundance of Trichocoleus in various treatments .
