Conversely the COMBAT study reported that washing hands with soap before meals was a sig- nificant protective factor 0.77 0.60-0.99 .Table 1Acquisition rates and risk factors for multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae MRE acquisition in international travel.AuthorYear CountryN included prevalence before departureAcquisition rate  and typeIndian sub continent South AsiaSouth East AsiaEast Asia MiddleEastNorth AfricaSub- Saharan AfricaCentral AmericaSouth AmericaNorth AmericaEuropa Oceania Risk factors for MRE acquisitionTangdenet al.2007 Sweden101124 ESBL-E88 7832 103133 4124 12506010213 216India gastroenteritisKennedy et al.2008 Australia1021.921.6 ESBL-EpAmpC-E57 81425 145613 32325 2820 15010021Asia South America Africagastroenteritis antibiotics useOstholm-Balkhed et al.2008 Sweden2622.431.2 ESBL-EpAmpC-E71 101445 265843 133021 157117 52901601502Asia Indian subcontinent NorthAfrica vs Europe age fever diarrhoeagastrointestinal disordersKanteleet al.2009 Finland4301.221 ESBL-E46 2861333310133 2633 41212 23193040017South Asia diarrhoea antibiotics useAngelinet al.2010 Sweden99735.4 ESBL-E70 213053 10190110 44001040403South and South East Asiaantibiotics usePaltansing et al.

Yet no pre-travel samples which could have confirmed the changes in the gut microbiota composition during the travel were analysed in this study.As for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance - conferring genes ARGs during travel Von Wintersdorff et al.

It is interesting to emphasize that in the study of Reuland et al.

Likewise Kantele et al.

ob- served that the MRE acquisition rate in subjects traveling to the Indian subcontinent was 23 in those who did not develop diarrhoea 47 in those who had diarrhoea without taking antibiotics and reached 80 in those who had diarrhoea with antibiotics  thereby highlighting thesynergistic effect of risk factors.More sporadically other risk factors were found age  34 y  duration of stay Kuenzli et al.

Hence Johnning et al.

The authors observed a sig- nificant increase of the most common amino-acid substitution in GyrA S83L and a decrease in the diversity of genotypes suggesting a de- crease in the diversity of E. coli .Bengtsson-Palme et al.
