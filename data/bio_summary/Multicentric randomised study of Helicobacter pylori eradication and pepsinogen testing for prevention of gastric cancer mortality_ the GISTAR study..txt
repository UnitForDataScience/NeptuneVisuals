the main study site is latvia where the estimated asr world per 100000 for gastric cancer mortality was16.2 in men and 6.4 in women in 2011. other potential sites include the russian federation with gastric cancer mortality of 20.8 in men and 8.5 in women belarus with20.2 in men and 7.8 in women and ukraine with 17.4 in men and 6.6 in women in 2011.the primary objective is to determine if h pylori eradica- tion combined with non-invasive screening and follow-up of precancerous lesions atrophic gastritis or higher reduces mortality from gastric cancer in a high risk popu- lation among 40-64-year-old subjects.in addition to the above secondary objectives include analyses of success rates of h pylori eradication therapy resistance rates of h pylori to the key antibiotics used in standard therapies in subgroups potential adverse effects of population-based eradication including effects on gut microbiome optimisation of follow-up strategies as well as search for new biomarkers including volatile markers.the key hypotheses of the study are 1 h pylori eradica- tion in middle-aged individuals in a high risk population with endoscopic follow-up of those with evidence of atro- phic gastritis prevents gastric cancer mortality 2 h pylori eradication is effective in preventing gastric cancer mortality even after the development of gastric mucosal atrophy 3 certain population subgroups can derive more benefit from h pylori eradication and therefore could be targeted if general population eradication is not feasible 4 a combination of biomarker screening and upper endoscopy is an appropriate strategy to prevent mortality from gastric cancer in high incidence areas.the study protocol version 4.5 revised on 7 september 2015 was approved by the ethics committee of theinternational agency for research on cancer iec 12-36 as well as the national ethics committees in latvia the ethics committee of riga east university support foun- dation no.14-a13 and the central medical ethics committee no.

to achieve this we will invite men in priority by direct telephone calls and invitation mails while accept participation of women in case they are the family members of the invited men or express their interest in participating in the study by contacting the study team.all participants must sign an informed consent and they should be in good health at enrolment as determined by medical history and physical examination performed by a study physician.individuals will be excluded from the trial if they have any of the following personal history of gastric cancer prior to enrolment gastric resections due to benign disease participants with ulcer suturing and vagotomy are eligible h pylori eradication therapy within 12 months prior to inclusion irrespective of the treat- ment result presence of alarm symptoms for digestive or any other diseases pathological findings at physical investigation suggestive of a serious disease requiring immediate management factors otherwise limiting the participation according to the protocol serious psychological conditionspsychiatric disease limiting the possibilities to understand the requirements for diagnostic andor medical interventions or low expec- tations on the compliance for the diagnostic work-up treatment or follow-up.interventionsthe general study design is illustrated in .after being provided detailed information on the study by the study personnel and signing a consent form individuals with alarm and exclusion symptoms will be identified by a study physician.

these analyses will be repeated for gastric cancer incidence difference between the two groups.it is expected that the obtained data will allow running cost-effectiveness ancillary studies on mass-eradication of h pylori by considering the costs of the adverse effects as well as on endoscopic surveillance of patients with gastric precancerous lesions in european countries with a rela- tively high risk.the study subject recruitment to the pilot phase has just been completed to test assumptions defined for the study including acceptability and adherence to the intervention and h pylori prevalence and to test the appropriateness of the chosen tools and infrastructure for the study.

the susceptibility of h pylori to commonly used antibiotics in the eradication therapies will be investigated using the pilot study datafrom approximately 200 upper endoscopy referrals with evidence of h pylori in antral biopsies proportion of individuals with altered biomarker results and another proportion with normal biomarkers.the groups will be followed at 5-year intervals by direct or telephone contact or alternative means of communi- cation until the study end-points are reached.

the study size may need to be increased if lower prevalence of h pylori infection higher number of women included in the study and or lower acceptancecompliance to h pylori eradicationtherapy are observed.gastric cancer mortality will be compared between intervention and control groups using a log-rank test.

in addition in this phase the accuracy of biomarkers for detecting atrophy will be evaluated by comparing different alternatives eg different manufac- turer tests different cut-off values against histology.discussionh pylori gastritis has been defined as an infectious disease according to the kyoto global consensus conference and once-per-lifetime eradication treatment with antibi- otics seems to be a rational and cost-effective approach to prevent gastric cancer as well as other h pylori-re- lated diseases including peptic ulcer and functional dyspepsia.in high-risk countries for gastric cancer this would mean giving antibiotic treatment to the majority of the population as is the case for latvia where h pylori prevalence is around 80.the risk of adverse events and increased antibiotic resistance are major concerns the magnitude of these risks has not been sufficiently investigated in well-controlled studies and no country has implemented a population-based search-and-treat strategy for h pylori.pepsinogens are markers for atrophy of the stomach mucosa decreased pepsinogen values have been demonstrated to correlate with increased risk of gastric cancer furthermore a combination of pepsinogen testing and h pylori detection has been suggested to be the best available non-invasive option for gastric cancer risk stratification.however the accuracy of pepsinogen tests to identify gastric cancer and even atrophy is imper- fect.the current european maps guidelines being referred to above are recommending surveillance of patients with precancerous lesions to enable detection of those progressing to high-risk lesions or cancer as a strategy of decreasing gastric cancer related mortality.however there is still a lack of evidence from randomised control trials of combining once-per-lifetime eradication of h pylori and screening for high-risk conditions with blood markers such as pepsinogens for reducing gastric cancer mortality.

the enrolment has been initiated in three study centres in latvia tukums dobele and rezekne cauca- sian population with the potential expansion to other locations more genetically diverse populations would be enrolled when the study is expanded to other sites.recruitment centres will be set up reflecting the study requirements.

if new sites outside latvia are to be included study design will be adapted to local conditions for better acceptance and affordability without compromising the scientific objec- tives.in conclusion the study would have major public health implications by providing leads for prevention activities in populations with elevated rates of gastric cancer partic- ularly in baltic and eastern european regions where the public health burden from the disease is substantial.ethics data safety and disseminationthe ethics committee of iarc has approved the study protocol 26032013 and the relevant protocol updates 02102015. reg.

multicentric randomised study of helicobacter pylori eradication and pepsinogen testingfor prevention of gastric cancer mortality the gistar study.

the gistar study will allow us to investigate the role of h pylori infection and participants' characteristics on the performance of biomarkers for identifying individuals at high risk of gastric cancer.a few limitations of the study design should be mentioned.

however we acknowledge that our extra effort to balance the male and female ratio to ensure sufficient study power to answer the research questions may influence the generalisability of the study results.the inclusion of colorectal cancer screening in both groups as an incentive may encourage participation and adherence however the general participation may be affected by the fact that only half of the participants are offered h pylori eradication and screening for precan- cerous lesions.

widespread use of the same antibiotics used to treat common diseases some of them life-threatening may lead to increased antibiotic resistance of microorganisms other than h pylori.an inverse association observed between the occurrence of gastric and oesophageal cancers may suggest potential opposing effects of the related environmental factors including h pylori.the potential risks of these effects in community settings were not considered in the above mentioned cost-effectiveness analysesand knowledge about the potential adverse effects of h pylori eradication on the gut microbiome is scant.therefore the recently published european guide on quality improvement in comprehensive cancer control emphasised the need for additional clinical studies to clarify whether and how to implement population-based h pylori screening and eradication programmes for gastric cancer prevention.in addition to the population-based eradication of h pylori detection and treatment of precancerous lesions or early gastric cancer has been proposed as a means to reduce gastric cancer mortality and some countries in thewestern pacific region have introduced nationwide gastric cancer screening programmes.pepsinogen testing is currently the best available non-invasive option to iden- tify individuals with precancerous lesions in particular gastric atrophywho are at increased risk of gastric cancer.

for participants undergoing endoscopy histological confirmation will be required for h pylori positivity.the selected cut-off values for pepsinogens character- istic for gastric mucosal atrophy is based on our previous research those with pepsinogen pgipgii 2 and pgi30 ngml will be referred for upper endoscopy with a detailed biopsy work-up according to the updated sydney system.histological assessment of the biopsies collected from the stomach will be independently performed by two experienced pathologists in the case of discrepant results the particular slides will be reviewed together to reach consensus.all participants who are h pylori positive will be reinvited and offered h pylori eradication treatment.

second-line treatment will not be offered within the study however study participants requiring it will be referred to their gps with relevant recommenda- tions.
