Other potential sites include the Russian Federation with gastric cancer mortality of 20.8 in men and 8.5 in women Belarus with20.2 in men and 7.8 in women and Ukraine with 17.4 in men and 6.6 in women in 2011.The primary objective is to determine if H pylori eradica- tion combined with non-invasive screening and follow-up of precancerous lesions atrophic gastritis or higher reduces mortality from gastric cancer in a high risk popu- lation among 40-64-year-old subjects.In addition to the above secondary objectives include analyses of success rates of H pylori eradication therapy resistance rates of H pylori to the key antibiotics used in standard therapies in subgroups potential adverse effects of population-based eradication including effects on gut microbiome optimisation of follow-up strategies as well as search for new biomarkers including volatile markers.The key hypotheses of the study are 1 H pylori eradica- tion in middle-aged individuals in a high risk population with endoscopic follow-up of those with evidence of atro- phic gastritis prevents gastric cancer mortality 2 H pylori eradication is effective in preventing gastric cancer mortality even after the development of gastric mucosal atrophy 3 certain population subgroups can derive more benefit from H pylori eradication and therefore could be targeted if general population eradication is not feasible 4 a combination of biomarker screening and upper endoscopy is an appropriate strategy to prevent mortality from gastric cancer in high incidence areas.The study protocol version 4.5 revised on 7 September 2015 was approved by the Ethics Committee of theInternational Agency for Research on Cancer IEC 12-36 as well as the national Ethics Committees in Latvia the Ethics Committee of Riga East University Support Foun- dation No.14-A13 and the Central Medical Ethics Committee No.

In addition in this phase the accuracy of biomarkers for detecting atrophy will be evaluated by comparing different alternatives eg different manufac- turer tests different cut-off values against histology.dIscussIonH pylori gastritis has been defined as an infectious disease according to the Kyoto Global Consensus Conference and once-per-lifetime eradication treatment with antibi- otics seems to be a rational and cost-effective approach to prevent gastric cancer as well as other H pylori-re- lated diseases including peptic ulcer and functional dyspepsia.In high-risk countries for gastric cancer this would mean giving antibiotic treatment to the majority of the population as is the case for Latvia where H pylori prevalence is around 80.The risk of adverse events and increased antibiotic resistance are major concerns the magnitude of these risks has not been sufficiently investigated in well-controlled studies and no country has implemented a population-based search-and-treat strategy for H pylori.Pepsinogens are markers for atrophy of the stomach mucosa decreased pepsinogen values have been demonstrated to correlate with increased risk of gastric cancer furthermore a combination of pepsinogen testing and H pylori detection has been suggested to be the best available non-invasive option for gastric cancer risk stratification.However the accuracy of pepsinogen tests to identify gastric cancer and even atrophy is imper- fect.The current European MAPS guidelines being referred to above are recommending surveillance of patients with precancerous lesions to enable detection of those progressing to high-risk lesions or cancer as a strategy of decreasing gastric cancer related mortality.However there is still a lack of evidence from randomised control trials of combining once-per-lifetime eradication of H pylori and screening for high-risk conditions with blood markers such as pepsinogens for reducing gastric cancer mortality.

Widespread use of the same antibiotics used to treat common diseases some of them life-threatening may lead to increased antibiotic resistance of microorganisms other than H pylori.An inverse association observed between the occurrence of gastric and oesophageal cancers may suggest potential opposing effects of the related environmental factors including H pylori.The potential risks of these effects in community settings were not considered in the above mentioned cost-effectiveness analysesand knowledge about the potential adverse effects of H pylori eradication on the gut microbiome is scant.Therefore the recently published European Guide on Quality Improvement in Comprehensive Cancer Control emphasised the need for additional clinical studies to clarify whether and how to implement population-based H pylori screening and eradication programmes for gastric cancer prevention.In addition to the population-based eradication of H pylori detection and treatment of precancerous lesions or early gastric cancer has been proposed as a means to reduce gastric cancer mortality and some countries in theWestern Pacific region have introduced nationwide gastric cancer screening programmes.Pepsinogen testing is currently the best available non-invasive option to iden- tify individuals with precancerous lesions in particular gastric atrophywho are at increased risk of gastric cancer.

For participants undergoing endoscopy histological confirmation will be required for H pylori positivity.The selected cut-off values for pepsinogens character- istic for gastric mucosal atrophy is based on our previous research those with pepsinogen PgIPgII 2 and PgI30 ngmL will be referred for upper endoscopy with a detailed biopsy work-up according to the updated Sydney system.Histological assessment of the biopsies collected from the stomach will be independently performed by two experienced pathologists in the case of discrepant results the particular slides will be reviewed together to reach consensus.All participants who are H pylori positive will be reinvited and offered H pylori eradication treatment.

For example gastric cancer incidence rates are the highest in Belarus age-stan- dardised rate ASR of 42.1100 000 in men and 17.2100 000 in women among 40 European countries.These estimates are over threefold higher than those in France or Switzerland.The rates in the majority of the former Soviet Union regions remain high.Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the major aetiolog- ical factor responsible for developing gastric cancer.It is estimated that 89 of non-cardia gastric cancers are attributable to this infection.Searching for and eradicating H pylori in healthy asymp- tomatic adults the 'search-and-treat' strategy has been suggested to be cost-effective by considering the reduc- tion of gastric cancer burden as well as other diseases related to this microorganism.

The susceptibility of H pylori to commonly used antibiotics in the eradication therapies will be investigated using the pilot study datafrom approximately 200 upper endoscopy referrals with evidence of H pylori in antral biopsies proportion of individuals with altered biomarker results and another proportion with normal biomarkers.The groups will be followed at 5-year intervals by direct or telephone contact or alternative means of communi- cation until the study end-points are reached.

The study size may need to be increased if lower prevalence of H pylori infection higher number of women included in the study and or lower acceptancecompliance to H pylori eradicationtherapy are observed.Gastric cancer mortality will be compared between intervention and control groups using a log-rank test.

These analyses will be repeated for gastric cancer incidence difference between the two groups.It is expected that the obtained data will allow running cost-effectiveness ancillary studies on mass-eradication of H pylori by considering the costs of the adverse effects as well as on endoscopic surveillance of patients with gastric precancerous lesions in European countries with a rela- tively high risk.The study subject recruitment to the pilot phase has just been completed to test assumptions defined for the study including acceptability and adherence to the intervention and H pylori prevalence and to test the appropriateness of the chosen tools and infrastructure for the study.
