The proportion of DWW2 and 3a colonies in the high pyocyanin expressing pig- mented and low pyocyanin expressing non-pigmented areas of co-culture biofilms at 48 h incubation are shown in .The most obvious features of these data are the higher proportions of 3a in the high pyocya- nin expressing pigmented areas of the biofilms than in the non-pigmented areas At 48 h strain 3a comprised 6.8 - 5.81 of the biofilm in the pigmented areas mean strain 3a count from 8 replicate samples  2.65 x 107 - 1.84 x 107 CFU vs. mean DWW2 count  4.54 x 108 -x 108 compared with 1.69 - 1.57 in the non-pigmented areas mean strain 3a count from 8 replicate samples  5.12 x 106 - 4.79 x 106 CFU vs. mean DWW2 count  2.83 x 108 - 1.72 x 108 p  0.05 .Effect of DWW23a biofilm co-culture on the conversion of DWW2 to the DWW2-NM phenotypeAlthough the data shown in showed no significant difference between the proportions of non-mucoid colonies arising in whole mono- and co-culture biofilms at the three time- points sampled the relative proportions of DWW2-NM arising in the pigmented and in the non-pigmented areas that were observable at approximately 48 h was investigated to deter- mine whether the presence of S. anginosus strain 3a affected the degree of conversion of strain DWW2 to the DWW2-NM phenotype .

Under most atmospheric conditions tested there was an approximate 1-2 log10 increase in streptococcal numbers between mono- culture and co-culture with exceptions at i 72 h in 10 CO2 6.33 x 107 - 3.84 x 107 CFU in monoculture increasing to 1.68 x 108 - 7.35 x 107 CFU in co-culture ffi 2.65 fold increase fol- lowing a marked drop in counts between 48 h 4.09 x 109 - 1.92 x 109 CFU and 72 h 1.68 x 108 - 7.35 x 107 CFU when in co-culture and ii 72 h under anoxic conditions 1.24 x 109 -2.74 x 108 CFU in monoculture decreasing to 4.75 x 108 - 2.13 x 108 CFU in co-culture.

A Co-culture with 3a results in increased pyocyanin expression by the original strain DWW2 black bars n  3 independent biofilms at 48 h and by the mucoid DWW2-M white bars n  6 independent biofilms at 72 h and non-mucoid DWW2-NM grey bars n  6 independent biofilms at 48 h biofilm-derived colony phenotypes.

Statistical analysis of bacterial counts obtained for strain 3a and DWW2 in mono-culture and in co-culture for each time point were by two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test   p0.05.Progressive conversion of DWW2 to a Non-Mucoid DWW2-NM colony phenotype and development of localised variation in pyocyanin expression within DWW2 and DWW23a biofilmsDuring biofilm development in 10 CO2 the proportion of non-mucoid colonies of DWW2 isolated on PIA was seen to increase dramatically between 24 h and 48 h in both mono- and co-culture with this phenotype comprising 94.73 - 1.81 of the total DWW2 count in mono- culture and 97.4 - 2.1 in co-culture by 72 h .

The proportions of mucoid and non-mucoid types present in the pigmented and non-pigmented areas of the DWW2-M  3a biofilms again show that a high proportion of pyocyanin producing non-mucoid types are present in the pigmented areas 75.5 - 8.8 in contrast to the non-pigmented 13.1 - 7.01 p0.05 .Effect of DWW2-M and DWW2-NM on S. anginosus strain 3a numbers when in co-cultureColony counts of strain 3a were determined from 24 h biofilms in monoculture and in co-cul- ture with DWW2-M and DWW2-NM.

Concurrently during biofilm incubation areas of varying intensities of pyocyanin production were observed to develop between 48 h and 72 h within individual DWW2 biofilms whether in monoculture  or in co-culture with 3a  in 10 CO2 .In order to compare the proportions of DWW2 and 3a in the high pigmented and low non-pigmented pyocyanin expressing locations within co-culture biofilms replicate pig- mented and non-pigmented zones were sampled using a 5 ml sterile disposable plastic bacterio- logical loop and the material collected transferred to 1ml of sterile PBS.

A significance level of p  0.05 was consid- ered significant throughout.ResultsAnalysis of mixed biofilm growth of P. aeruginosa strain DWW2 and S. anginosus strain 3a under normoxic hypercapnic 10 CO2 and anoxic atmospheresThe results of growing mono- and co-culture biofilms of strains DWW2 and 3a under differ- ent atmospheres are shown as total CFU per filter .Both strains were able to grow singly and in combination under all test conditions with S. anginosus 3a increasing in numbers when in co-culture.

Significant increases in the numbers of 3a were observed in co-culture biofilms with DWW2-M 5.35 x 108 - 1.08 x108 CFU and with DWW2-NM 3.79 x 108 - 1.26 x 108 CFU compared with 3a in monoculture 3.11 x106 - 2.21 x106 CFU p0.0001  .Effect of mono- and co-culture infections with 3a DWW2 DWW2-M and DWW2-NM on G. mellonella survivalThe G. mellonella larval survival data at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation with strains either sin- gly or in combination are shown in .

Subculturing DWW2-M and DWW2-NM colonies on PIA in 10 CO2 for 48 hA non-mucoid colony phenotype of P. aeruginosa strain DWW2 DWW2-NM and higher numbers of S. anginosus strain 3a are associated with pigment pyocyanin production in co-culture biofilms.
