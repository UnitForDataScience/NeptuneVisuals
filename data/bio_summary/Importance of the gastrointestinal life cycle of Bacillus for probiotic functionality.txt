germination in the gut including the fate of ingested Bacillus spores and the ratio of vegetative cells and spores in the different gut sections across different hosts the length of time that the Bacillus persist in the gut after their withdrawal from the diet and the influence of GIT physiology and Bacillus strain.While the life cycle of pathogenic Bacillus in human GIT has been extensively researched Hutchison et al.

The spores protect the bacterium by attaining a highly defensive state that is resistant to environmentalconditions such as extreme temperature radiation pH pressure and toxic chemical agents that would harm the vegetative form Pedraza-Reyes et al.

The unique and intrinsic composition of Bacillus spores provides high tolerance to the acidic conditions in the stomach upon ingestion as described in Table .The spore will germinate in the presence of germinants nutrients or non-nutrients Swick et al.
