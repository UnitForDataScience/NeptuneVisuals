the micro- bial counterpart has been shaped in terms of their composition and metabolic potential by taking cues from the state of their hosts' physiology and immediate external environments 1. aging is characterized by alterations in distinct sets of host functions including cellular function leading to oxidative stress and senescence and a pathophysiological decline of most organs and metabolic homeostasis 2-4. in particular there is decline of the musculoskeletal system 5 6 which contributes to alterations in the quality of life.the gut microbiota may directly or indirectly impact several age-related aspects 7-12 and is an under- explored area of investigation 13 14.the microbiome has been implicated in several aspects associated with aging including rate of aging 15 inflammation 16 immunity 17 and muscle status 18. previously it was shown that there is a significant relationship between age and the taxonomic and altered metabolic potential of the microbiome in mice 8. associations between microbiome age and pro- inflammatory status serum mcp-1 status mice have also been identified 19. however an integrated view of age-related alterations in gut microbiome muscle physiology and biochemical protein and lipid markers would help to define areas of further investigation and potential intervention to support 'healthy aging'.previously we investigated the susceptibility of muscles in rats to age-related decline 20. in the current study we characterized the same rats to determine a metabolic fingerprint of the aging phenotype and investigated the associated alterations of the microbiome as a contributor to age-related physiology and sarcopenia.

this enabled us to define a consensus phenotype of age-related alterations in gut microbiome muscle physiology and biochemical protein and lipid markers of aging.resultsin this study we sought to investigate the association of age and sarcopenia aas-related gut microbial changes with host physiology and identify the potential molecular mechanisms underlying these associations to evaluate the potential of targeting the microbiome in aas-related health.

using aged wistar rats of ages 8 18 and 24 months subsequently referred to as 8m for adult 18m for adult-pre-sarcopenic and 24m for adult- sarcopenic respectively similar framework as our previous work 20 we determined the ecological states of the microbiome at the various ages identified potential metabolic functions of these states and integrated this analysis with the biochemical and physiological phenotypes figure 1a.gut microbial diversity in aged ratsthe gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that reflects the contribution of multiple environmental such as diet drugs and pathogens and host-related immunity factors.

towards that goal analysing human microbial ecology during aging and sarcopenia will be of major importance and transplanting these aged human microbiomes to germ free rodents will be key to uncouple aging of the microbiome from other physiological and environmental perturbations that co- exist during human aging.conclusionsconsidering the needs of the elderly in society and for cost-effective means to support healthy aging our research findings are the most comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiome in context of the molecular mechanisms of aging in preclinical models studied to date.

in our study we simultaneously characterised and investigated age-related alterations in gut microbiome muscle physiology and serum protein and lipid markers to define a consensus phenotype of age-related alterations in gut microbiome and host physiology.

in order to identify areas of potential exploration and intervention we simultaneously characterized age-related alterations in gut microbiome muscle physiology and serum proteomic and lipidomic profiles in aged rats to define an integrated signature of the aging phenotype.

we demonstrate that aging skews the composition of the gut microbiome in particular by altering the sutterella to barneseilla ratio and alters the metabolic potential of intestinal bacteria.

age-related changes of the gut microbiome were associated with the physiological decline of musculoskeletal function and with molecular markers of nutrient processingavailability and inflammatoryimmune status in aged versus adult rats.

altogether our study highlights that aging leads to a complex interplay between the microbiome and host physiology and provides candidate microbial species to target physical and metabolic decline during aging by modulating gut microbial ecology.introductionthe concept of 'healthy aging' addresses the need to combat the economic burden of an aging population its physiological and social consequences and subsequent reduced quality of life.

our observations of the microbial ecology using nmds plots of the community structures beta diversity suggest that the microbiome is affected by aging.

the composition alpha diversity of the microbiome at the three ages demonstrated unique otus at each age but generally did not distinguish one age-related community from another figure 1c.the otus identified in the 16s survey were organised into categories based on the observed abundance across the ages figure 1d further described in supplementary materials.

sarcopenia through multi- factorial mechanisms involving mitochondrial and neuromuscular dysfunction 20 22. having charac- terized the genetic composition of the microbiome we investigated whether the age-related changes observed in the ecology of the gut microbiota could account forsome of the physiological parameters associated with aging and sarcopenia.
