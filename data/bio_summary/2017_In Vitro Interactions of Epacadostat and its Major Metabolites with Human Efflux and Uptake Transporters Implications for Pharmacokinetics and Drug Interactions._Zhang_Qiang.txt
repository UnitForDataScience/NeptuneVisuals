2016 revealed that when M9 was incubated with human feces homogenate M9 was almost completely consumed in 24 hours with EPAC and M11 the two major products observed suggesting the deglucuronidation of M9 to form EPAC via gut microbiota.

Under the most conservative consid- eration if all EPAC molecules after an oral dose of 300 mg the highest dose in clinical development are converted to M11 in the intestine or M9 in the liver with all M9 molecules moving to the intestine the I2 concentrations of M11 and M9 would be the same as that of EPAC 2740 mM.

Consequently the EPAC glucuro- nide M9 as the most abundant metabolite in human plasma was further studied as a substrate for MRP2 and MRP3 to better understand the mechanisms of disposition of M9 in the liver and its implication for the pharmacokinetics of EPAC.Materials and MethodsMaterials.

The ER of M9 was 2.5 and1.9 at 1 or 20 mM respectively suggesting that the efflux of M9 in Caco- 2 cells is minimal and it is unlikely a P-gp substrate Fig.

6 E and F. These results confirm that M9 is a substrate of both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.Evaluation of M9 as a Substrate for MRP2 and MRP3.

The ERBCRPERcontrol value of prazosin was not reduced in the presence of various concentrations of EPAC or M9 0-300 mM which indicates that EPAC and M9 are not inhibitors of BCRP.

Because the ratios of total CmaxIC50 of M9 and M11 for OATP1B3 are greater than 0.1 the R values of M9 and M11 were calculated using extrapo- lation Table 5 by following the decision tree in the FDA guidance FDA 2012.

Both EPAC and M9 in the bile move to the intestine lumen where M9 can be converted back to parent EPAC by gut microflora.

Thus the interactions of M9 with hepatic drug transporters were investigated to gain insight about the disposition of M9 in the liver and its implication for the pharmacokinetics of EPAC.

Although more studies are needed in this emerging area in the future the transporter-mediated disposition of glucuronide metabolites of EPAC ezetimibe and diclofenac in the liver might support this hypothesis.Potentially modulation of the interactions of M9 with the transporters responsible for its disposition may have an impact on the pharmacoki- netics of EPAC because of the high systemic exposure and possible involvement of M9 in the EHC of EPAC.
