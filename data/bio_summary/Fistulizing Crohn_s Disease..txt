In the long-term about two out of three patients appeared to achieve persistent fistula closure whereas one out of three patients suffered from recurrence in a retro- spective analysis of 156 CD patients with perianal disease receiving IFX.Regarding adalimumab there are no trials investigating fistula closure as primary endpoint.

In some patients perianal fistulas may even occur years before the onset of luminal inflammation.However inthe vast majority of patients 95 perianal disease activity is paralleled by luminal disease activity and only in 5 of the patients perianal disease activity is detectable in patients without luminal inflammation.Besides fistulas a significant number of CD patients develops intestinal fibrosis and strictures.

In any case a recent multicenter trial currently only published in abstract form DDW 2016  with 117 patients revealed an incremental gain in efficacy rates with higher doses and IFX trough levels with fistula healing rates defined as absence of draining fistula in up to 80 in the patients with very high trough levels IFX  20 2 mgml.

Perianal fistulas are most common in patients suffering from colonic CD with rectal involvement 92 of patients but are rare in patients with isolated ileal disease 12 of patients.

A simple fistula is a low fistula with only a single external opening and is not associated with abscess formation rectovaginal fistula or an anorectal stricture.

This observation confirms that carcinomas arising from fistula tracts are a rare event in CD patients.PATHOGENESISFistulas are thought to arise as consequence of an acute inflammatory process paralleled by infection and suppuration.From a morphological point of view a fistula represents a tract between two surfaces that is lined by epithelial cells and filled with cell debris erythrocytes and inflammatory cells.A chronic inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis are common findings surrounding the fistula tract.

As also our understanding of fistula pathogenesis is limited to date further research is warranted to on the one hand obtain a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying fistula development and on the other hand for identifying and establishing novel and hopefully more effective treatment options for fistula therapy.CONFLICT OF INTERESTGuarantor of the article Michael Scharl MD.Specific author contributions All authors participated sufficiently intellectually or practically in the work to take public responsibility for the content of the article including the conception design data interpretation and writing of the manuscript.

The remaining two third of patients either under- went surgery or experienced spontaneous healing.A more recent study revealed that recurrence of clinically healed fistulas is 44 within 18 months.The chance of fistula healing depends on fistula location.

In rectal mucosa expression of IL-1b and IL-6 is higher in patients with perianal CD than in those with small bowel CD and in healthy controls.Upregulation of TNF and IL-12 in resected intestinal tissue from patients with CD was correlated with fistula development.

The maintenance population with continuous vedolizumab exposure achieved fistula closure at week 52 in a higher percentage 30.8 as compared to those patients being re-randomized to placebo 11.1.However patient numbers were extremely small higher fraction of responders 7 out of 18 41.2 in the 8 week vs. the 4 week treatment interval group 5 out of 22 patients 22.7 and therefore results of the above-mentioned study have to be awaited until any verdict on the potential effectiveness of this agent in fistulizing CD can be reached.
