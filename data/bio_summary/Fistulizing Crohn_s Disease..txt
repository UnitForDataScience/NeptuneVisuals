in some patients perianal fistulas may even occur years before the onset of luminal inflammation.however inthe vast majority of patients 95 perianal disease activity is paralleled by luminal disease activity and only in 5 of the patients perianal disease activity is detectable in patients without luminal inflammation.besides fistulas a significant number of cd patients develops intestinal fibrosis and strictures.

in the long-term about two out of three patients appeared to achieve persistent fistula closure whereas one out of three patients suffered from recurrence in a retro- spective analysis of 156 cd patients with perianal disease receiving ifx.regarding adalimumab there are no trials investigating fistula closure as primary endpoint.

after a follow-up period of 10 years about one third of patients suffer from persistent perianal fistulas according to a study from 1980. the remaining two third of patients either under- went surgery or experienced spontaneous healing.a more recent study revealed that recurrence of clinically healed fistulas is 44 within 18 months.the chance of fistula healing depends on fistula location.

perianal fistulas are most common in patients suffering from colonic cd with rectal involvement 92 of patients but are rare in patients with isolated ileal disease 12 of patients.

e-mail received 10 april 2017 accepted 19 may 2017with high fistulas or presence of proctitis a considerably lower healing rate and risk for postoperative incontinence has been reported.in line with this absence of proctitis indepen- dently predicts both enhanced healing and reduced recur- rence rates.in contrast in patients with perianal cd and rectal involvement proctectomy is more frequent.in a single center study involving 232 patients with perianal cd longstanding remission for complex fistulas was seen in only 37 of patients after a 10-year follow-up compared with almost 67 for simple fistulas.a recent systematic review concluded that a combination of medical and surgical treatment approaches is superior to either single treatment alone.

in any case a recent multicenter trial currently only published in abstract form ddw 2016  with 117 patients revealed an incremental gain in efficacy rates with higher doses and ifx trough levels with fistula healing rates defined as absence of draining fistula in up to 80 in the patients with very high trough levels ifx  20 2 mgml.

in rectal mucosa expression of il-1b and il-6 is higher in patients with perianal cd than in those with small bowel cd and in healthy controls.upregulation of tnf and il-12 in resected intestinal tissue from patients with cd was correlated with fistula development.

a simple fistula is a low fistula with only a single external opening and is not associated with abscess formation rectovaginal fistula or an anorectal stricture.

this observation confirms that carcinomas arising from fistula tracts are a rare event in cd patients.pathogenesisfistulas are thought to arise as consequence of an acute inflammatory process paralleled by infection and suppuration.from a morphological point of view a fistula represents a tract between two surfaces that is lined by epithelial cells and filled with cell debris erythrocytes and inflammatory cells.a chronic inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis are common findings surrounding the fistula tract.

as also our understanding of fistula pathogenesis is limited to date further research is warranted to on the one hand obtain a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying fistula development and on the other hand for identifying and establishing novel and hopefully more effective treatment options for fistula therapy.conflict of interestguarantor of the article michael scharl md.specific author contributions all authors participated sufficiently intellectually or practically in the work to take public responsibility for the content of the article including the conception design data interpretation and writing of the manuscript.

according to the ecco guidelines from 2016 once a perianal fistula is detected eua is considered to be the gold standard when performed by an experienced surgeon.fistulography is no longer recommended by the eccodue to clear-cut superiority of mri in depicting fistula tract anatomy in higher resolution including the tract- surrounding space for example abscess formation and extension thereof or muscular penetration and destruction.treatment.

in a systematic review from 2010 61 cases of carcinomas arising in perineal fistulas in cd patients have been described the majority in female patients 61. interestingly females were significantly younger at time of cancer diagnosis had shorter duration of cd and suffered from fistula formation for a shorter duration prior to cancer transformation as compared to males.

the maintenance population with continuous vedolizumab exposure achieved fistula closure at week 52 in a higher percentage 30.8 as compared to those patients being re-randomized to placebo 11.1.however patient numbers were extremely small higher fraction of responders 7 out of 18 41.2 in the 8 week vs. the 4 week treatment interval group 5 out of 22 patients 22.7 and therefore results of the above-mentioned study have to be awaited until any verdict on the potential effectiveness of this agent in fistulizing cd can be reached.

further research is needed to better understand fistula pathogenesis aiming to develop novel treatment option for our patients.clinical and translational gastroenterology 2017 8 e106 doi published online 13 july 2017subject category reviewintroductionthe first description of perianal fistulas as a typical complica- tion of terminal ileitis was published in 1938.population- based studies indicate that one third of crohn's disease cd patients will develop fistulas at least once during the disease course.

further il-13 il-13a1 and transforming growth factor tgf-b the strongest inducer of emt are detectable in fistula lining cells.data from the ibdchip european project including 1528 caucasian patients suggest that genetic factors differently modulate the risk for perianal disease and internal fistulas.
