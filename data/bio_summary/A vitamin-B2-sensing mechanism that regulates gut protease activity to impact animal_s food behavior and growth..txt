Therefore lack of sufficient FAD and FMN likely contributes to the low quality of heat-killed bacteria as a food source.To test if FAD also mediates the VB2 impact on TORC1 and protease production we showed that FAD supplementation improved food uptake intestinal protease activity and ELT-2 expression as VB2 does  .

To confirm this we measured the VB2 level in bacteria and found that VB2 level is low in heat-killed OP50 .Vitamin B2 promotes intestinal protease activityTo understand how VB2 affects food uptake in worms we tested the role of the digestive system by feeding worms with HK-OP50 culture pre-treated with exogenous digestive enzymes.

These data indicate that TORC1 activity is decreased in worms fed heat-killed bacteria and that VB2 supplementation significantly recovers the activity.We obtained further evidence that TORC1 acts downstream of VB2 by showing that TORC1 acti-vation is sufficient to mimic the effect of VB2 in boosting intestinal protease activity and food usage.Figure 4.

LGG-1GFP as a marker for activity downstream of TORC1 and the impact of food source on apical membrane polarity and VHA-6 localization in the intestine of C. elegans.Specifically we found that the nprl-3lf mutation significantly improved intestinal protease activity the expression of asp-13 and asp-14 larval growth measured by gonad length and dwelling behavior of worms fed HK-OP50  however this rescue was not because VB2 level was recov- ered as VB2 level in nprl-3 lf mutants fed heat-killed food did not increase  .

We have established a system to analyze the intestinal response to vitamin B2 VB2 deficiency in Caenorhabditis elegans and demonstrated that VB2 level critically impacts food uptake and foraging behavior by regulating specific protease gene expression and intestinal protease activity.

Taken together these data support that worms down-regulate digestive enzymes in response to VB2 deficiency.Proteases ASP-13 and ASP-14 and GATA factor ELT-2 play critical roles in VB2-promoted protease activity and food usabilityTo identify the proteases regulated by VB2 we examined the mRNA levels of 27 intestine-enriched protease genes .

We found that pretreatment with RNAi target- ing either daf-15raptor or ragc-1 encoding two key TORC1 components    essentially eliminated the effect of VB2 supplemen- tation on protease activity  indicating that VB2 induction of protease activity is TORC1 dependent.

Additional tests supported the hypothesis that down-regulating asp-13 and asp-14 by a low ELT-2 level critically contributes to the poor food usage in worms fed HK-OP50 .TORC1 mediates VB2-dependent regulation of protease activities and worm growthDespite extensive studies on nutrient sensing by TORC1 its role in food quality evaluation processes which include not only the detection of deficiency of a specific nutrient but also specific downstream physiological responses in live animals remain to be explored particularly for micronutrients such as VB2.

These data strongly support a critical role of ASP-13 and ASP-14 in the VB2-induced increase in protease activity and uptake of heat-killed bacteria.To identify transcription factors that regulate the expression of intestinal protease genes in response to VB2 supplementation we combined RNAi with the protease assay to screen 18 tran- scription factors previously shown to be enriched in the intestine   .
