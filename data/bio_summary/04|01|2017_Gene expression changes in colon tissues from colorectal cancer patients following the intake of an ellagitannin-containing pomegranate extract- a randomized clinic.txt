MYC was also moderately up- regulated following surgery and sample handling 60-70 individuals FC 1.5 in the normal tissues and 1.3 in the malignant tissues A. MYC up-regulation was also confirmed at the protein level in the malignant tissues FC1.5 Supplementary Table S4.Other genes such as EGFR A TYMS B and TP53 resulted significantly up-regulated after surgery only in the malignant tissues N 60 individuals FC 1.4 to 2.3 Pb.05 whereas CASP3 D was significantly down-regulated only in the normal tissue 60 individuals FC -2.8 Pb.05.

Early studies looking at the expression of MYC and GJA1 Connexin 43 in colonic tissues following the consumption of b-carotene showed that expression changes in these tissues were variable and could also be detected in the placebo group evidencing the difficulty in detecting significant changes associated with the intake of the compound and or the appearance of metabolites in the serum or tissues especially when comparing groups of small sample size n7-8 placebo n 5-10 b-carotene .

All rights reserved.Keywords Clinical trial Gene expression Colon tissues Ellagitannins Interindividual variability Urolithins Pomegranate extractIntroductionNumerous preclinical in vitro and animal studies have given evidence of the regulation of cell processes by polyphenols viaepigenetic changes as a general mechanism of action underlying the health benefits attributed to these compounds .

We conducted the first clinical trial in CRC patients where we provided evidence of the in vivo availability and concentrations of urolithins in the colon following a short- term supplementation with ET-containing PEs and also reported some specific and significant changes in various miRs in the human colon normal and malignant tissues after the intake of the PE .Using the same colon samples obtained from those CRC patientsthe aim of the present research was to test whether it was also possible to detect significant differential expression for various specific genes in colon human tissues in response to the supplementation with a PE.

For this molecule protein variability was not so much increased in the malignant tissues as compared with the normal ones CV 39.9 vs. 43.4 for Ns and Ms samples respectively or by the experimental protocol CV 43.5 vs. 39.9 for Mb and Ms samples respectively.Gene expression data presentation and validation of the studyThe results of the analysis of gene expression differences between the various tissues examined are listed in Supplementary Tables S3- S5.

To illustrate and compare the most relevant and representative responses in the different tissues examined A-D displays the expression changes for MYC CD44 CDKN1A and CTNNB1 and A-D for EGFR TYMS CASP3 and KRAS.Because of the high variability of the gene expression data and as a means to validate our study we evaluated gene expression differences between malignant and normal tissues for several genes that have been confirmed to be overexpressed or down-regulated in CRC .

To date very few trials have investigated and reported significant associations between the dietary intake of bioactive compounds and specific gene expression changes in human tissues and even less in human colon tissues.

Analysis of the tissues obtained from the control patients confirmed that the experimental procedure affected the variability and the expression of some of the investigated genes in the normal and or in the malignant tissues.
