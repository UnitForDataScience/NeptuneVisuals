The current study for the first time highlights the protective effect of aplysin a brominated sesquiterpene on the gut microbiota and the intestinal mucosal barrier against ethanol-induced liver injury in rats.Our previous studies have demonstrated that a sequential increase in the alcohol dose 812 mL kg-1 bw induces hepatic injury and overcomes tolerance caused by the alcohol Correlation analysis between gut microbiota composition and enzymology indexes of liver function.consumption at the same dose  .

However aplysin treatment reduced the abundance of Anaerophaga Anaerostipes and Peptococcus compared with those in the alcohol model group.P 0.05 vs ControlP 0.05 vs Model.reduced the abundance of Anaerophaga Anaerostipes and Peptococcus compared with those in the alcohol model group P 0.05 .The correlation analysis between gut microbiota and serological indexesBivariate borrelations analysis was performed between the 17 genera that were changed by alcohol or aplysin intervention in all the groups of rats.

The level of TG in liver tissue was also decreased.Liver histopathology and liver function changes in rats.

Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction ERIC-PCR and 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing were performed to provide an overview of the gut microbiota composition.ResultsChronic alcohol exposure caused liver damage in rats.

The liver pathological score in the alcohol model group was significantly increased compared with that of control group rats.

The liver pathology score in aplysin intervention group rats was better than that of the alcohol model group.

These bacterial strains involved in alcohol-induced liver injury and the protective effect of aplysin need to be further studied to explore their potential relationship.In conclusion this study indicated that chronic alcohol consumption could induce a wide range of changes in the gut microbiota damage the intestinal mucosal barrier result in endo- toxemia and influence the inflammatory condition of rats.

How- ever its potential effect on the gut microbiota and inflammation in rats with ethanol-induced liver injury has not been explored yet.Therefore the goal of this study was to assess the influence of aplysin on the intestinal mucosal barrier gut microbiota and inflammation in rats with ethanol-induced hepatic injury.

Liver cells in alcohol model group rats were swollen and their pathologi- cal score significantly increased compared with that of control group rats P 0.05 .
