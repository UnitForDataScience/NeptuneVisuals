The 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed an uneven genus distribution within the FrBGR microbiome whereby affiliates of the bacterial genus Coprothermobacter were predominant repre- senting approximately 76 of the total 16S rRNA gene inventory .

Searching the 16S rRNA data set against the metagenome data demonstrated that this population was among the 10 most abundant microbes in FrBGR comprising 0.5 of the total 16S rRNA gene sequences.

High-resolution investigation of the 16S rRNA gene inventory detected potential polymorphisms in the 16S rRNA data set demon- strating that the operational taxonomic units OTUs assigned as Coprothermobacter comprised at least 11 oligotypes Fig.

Proteins were extracted from the FrBGR sample by two approaches one tailored for extracting proteins from within the bacterial cells and one for proteins residing in the extracellular liquid.

The next day proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer separated by SDS-PAGE using an Any-kD Mini-Protean gel Bio-Rad Laboratories Hercules CA USA and stained using Coomassie brilliant blue R250.

Phylotypes affiliated with syntrophic bacteria from the genus Syntrophomonas were among the most prominent in the FrBGR 16S rRNA data set and two population bins were reconstructed for phylotypes closely affiliated with Syntrophomonas wolfei.

Slip although Syntrophothermus was not present among the abundant genera in the FrBGR 16S rRNA data set.

Only the most prominent with regard to relative abundance in the 16S rRNA gene sequence inventory and protein abundance phylotypes in the FrBGR microbial community were evaluated and it should be noted that a rare portion of the population might account for underlying key metabolic pathways not shown here.

More than 600000 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained using MiSeq sequencing of technical triplicates of the DNA sample.
