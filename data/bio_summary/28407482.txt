Stages of Gut Infection by S. TyphimuriumIn a normal gut CR usually prevents S. Typhimurium colonization.However in some hosts S. Typhimurium can grow by consuming microbiota-derived molecular hydrogen H2.After reaching a critical density S. Typhimurium invasion of the gut tissue triggers inflammation.

Here the microbiota has a profound effect on pathogen growth S. Typhimurium growth is fueled by molec- ular hydrogen H2 a central intermediate of anaerobic micro- biota metabolism   B. H2 concentrations typically exceed the Km of the S. Typhimurium hyb-H2-hydrogenase which makes it exploitable by the invading pathogen  partic- ularly when fumarate is present as an electron acceptor  .

Typhimurium can successfully establish and maintain its niche in the gut for prolonged periods of time by using the type VI secretion system T6SS to kill commensal bacteria.The administration of defined competing bacterial strains could be a promising therapeutic option to prevent intestinal colonization by S. Typhimurium.Protozoans can hinder S. Typhimurium growth either by consuming the pathogen or indirectly by inhibiting the colonization through induction of IL-18.In yet another approach a healthy and diverse microbiota may be fortified with commensals that target particular pathogens.

The use of the microbial fermentation product 12-propanediol and the electron acceptor tetrathionate  is another strategy used by S. Typhimurium to gain an edge D. Mucus-derived carbohydrates abundantly expelled into the gut lumen such as fucose and sialic acid can serve as carbon sour- ces for S. Typhimurium .

It will be interesting to discover whether barrier functions microbiota composition or other features may distin- guish susceptible from resistant individuals.As most molecular pathogenesis data come from studies of Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium S. Typhimurium our review will mostly focus on this serovar and in particular strains SL1344 and ATCC14028.

Vaccination experiments suggest that IgA may promote pathogen elimination from the gut lumen by enforcing enchained growth.surprisingly beneficial dramatic changes also take place in the gut lumen D and this inflamed milieu enhances the competitive fitness of S. Typhimurium versus the resident micro- biota fueling a massive pathogen bloom .

The high-affinity IgA is secreted into the gut lumen where it binds to the pathogen surface and blocks further pathogen access to the mucosal surface   F. Vaccination experiments with live attenuated vaccines and peracetic acid-inactivated S. Typhimurium show that protection occurs in an O-antigen-specific fashion  .

In this review we focus on Salmonella enterica Typhimurium S. Typhimurium a frequent cause of acute self- limiting food-borne diarrhea and a model that has revealed key principles of enteropathogen infection.

Typhimurium Elimination from the Gut LumenTwo mechanisms appear to remove S. Typhimurium from the in- fected gut lumen.

In germ-free mice 12-15 culturable sequenced strains harboring all major metabolic functions of the normal microbiota are indeed sufficient to restore CR against S. Typhimurium  .
