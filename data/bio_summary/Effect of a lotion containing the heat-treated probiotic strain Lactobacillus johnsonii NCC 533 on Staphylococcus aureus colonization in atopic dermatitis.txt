However with an expected S. aureus carriage rate of 50 in AD patients at least 30 patients needed to be included at Day 1 where S. aureus carriage was determined to ensure sufficient patients for HT La1 lotion assessment.For the methodology part all patients enrolled in the study from baseline to Day 8 before treatment Population 1 N31 were included in the corresponding statistical analy- ses.

Baseline characteristics were similar between the two populations and no statistically significant difference was found between them except that there was a majority 66.7 of male patients in Population 2 Table 1.All patients completed the study.Table 1 Baseline demographics and disease characteristicsBaseline characteristicsPopulation 1Population 2Patients n3121Age years SD33.5 11.633.0 12.5Female n 16 51.67 33.3Malefemale ratio0.942Atopic dermatitisSeverity n Mild2 6.50 0.0Moderate25 80.618 85.7Severe4 12.93 14.3Atopic dermatitis duration years27.1 14.226.5 14.7 SDTarget lesion SCORAD score SD 30.5 8.232.2 7.0Contralateral lesions n 20 64.515 71.4Location of target lesions n Ankle1 3.21 4.8Arm1 3.20 0.0Elbow14 45.211 52.4Forearm7 22.64 19.0Knee3 9.72 9.5Thigh1 3.21 4.8Tibia3 9.71 4.8Trunk1 3.21 4.8on local objective SCORAD assessment was performed usingLocation of contralaterallesions n N20N15the paired t-test.ResultsBaseline demographics and disease characteristics of all enrolled patientsA total of 31 patients were enrolled and participated in the first part of the study Population 1.

The first part of the study included all enrolled patients Population 1 N31 whereas the second part of the study included only those patients who were found to be carriers of S. aureus at the start of the study and presented with clinically visible lesions on Day 8 Population 2 N21.

All patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study.Study populationMale and female patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with AD of mild-to-moderate severity at baseline Investigator's Global Assessment scores of 2 or 3 who exhibited at least one AD lesion of 20 cm2 were eligible for inclusion in the study.15 The location of AD lesions had to allow sampling with the scrub wash method.For the purposes of this study lesional skin was defined as an active lesion of AD an erythematous plaque with or without oozing vesiculation crusting excoriations orerosions but with no overt signs of infection located within the antecubital or popliteal fossae or other region typical of AD.Exclusion criteria included severe fungal infection or other skin disease that could affect AD diagnosis any uncontrolled or serious disease or any condition that could interfere with data interpretation or put the patient at significant risk.

Target lesions were mostly located on the elbow in 14 45.2 patients and forearm in 7 22.6 patients.

In the same way analysis of the variance of S. aureus counts CFUcm2 at Days 1 3 and 8 before treatment showed that there was no time effect for swab p0.340 and scrub wash p0.532 in S. aureus-positive patients suggesting that both sampling methods were reproducible.Since swab and scrub wash were performed in 2 groups of patients at Day 1 Figure 1 the direct comparison of the two methods was performed on Day 3.

In those patients for whom S. aureus levels decreased in response to HT La1 lotion the minimum S. aureus concentration at Day 8 was2.89 Log CFUcm2.The 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based analysis of microbiota composition and diversity was performed on samples from the target lesions of 15 patients at Days 8 and28.

Also a slight reduc- tion of the Shannon diversity index was observed betweenTolerabilityWhen applied to the lesional skin of patients with AD HT La1 lotion was found to be well tolerated.DiscussionSeveral clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with AD are more likely to be colonized with S. aureus on lesional skin than healthy controls although the prevalence ofaureus colonization varies among studies.9 These variations are likely to be due to differences in the studied populations e.g.
