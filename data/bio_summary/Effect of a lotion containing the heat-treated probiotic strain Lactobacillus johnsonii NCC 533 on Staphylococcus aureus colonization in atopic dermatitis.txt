for permission for commercial use of this work please see paragraphs 4.2 and 5 of our terms vepressit is well known that staphylococcus aureus has a high prevalence on the skin of patients with ad3 and that patients with ad are prone to s. aureus infection and skin coloniza- tion.3-6 early studies have shown that 85 to 93 of lesional sites in patients with ad are colonized by s. aureus with bacterial loads exceeding 104 colony forming units cfu per cm2 of skin.

overall no major differences were noted in terms of s. aureus concentrationsbetween swab and scrub wash sampling although there was less variability using the scrub wash method as shown by the smaller standard deviations.a good correlation was also found between first and second samples taken from ad lesions of patients at base- line using both sampling methods swab or scrub wash and both quantification methods culture or qpcr indicating good repeatability of the methods pearson's correlation coefficient 0.83 p0.0001 figure 2. in the same way analysis of the variance of s. aureus counts cfucm2 at days 1 3 and 8 before treatment showed that there was no time effect for swab p0.340 and scrub wash p0.532 in s. aureus-positive patients suggesting that both sampling methods were reproducible.since swab and scrub wash were performed in 2 groups of patients at day 1 figure 1 the direct comparison of the two methods was performed on day 3. using scrub wash the mean s. aureus load 2.08 log10 cfucm -1.70 for qpcrtable 2 presence and concentration of staphylococcus aureus on the target lesion at baseline population 1notes in the absence of s. aureus detection the missing value was replaced by the limit of quantification of the method culture 10 cfuml pcr 5 cfuml.population 1 enrolled patients.abbreviations cfu colony forming units sd standard deviation min minimum max maximum pcr polymerase chain reaction.figure 2 repeatability first and second sampling of staphylococcuss aureus sampling a and quantification b methods at day 1 for load determination log10 cfucm2 in target atopic dermatitis lesions.notes results are presented for both quantification methods a and both sampling methods b. pearson's correlation coefficient 0.83.abbreviations cfu colony forming units pcr polymerase chain reaction.and 2.21 log10 cfucm -1.80 for culture was slightly but2significantly higher when compared with swab whatever the4.0quantification method 1.83 log10cfucm2-1.77 for qpcr3.5and 1.47 log10 cfu cm -1.66 for culture.

the protocol was submitted and approved by ethics committee of la charite center number ea1 712115 and the freiburger ethik-kommision international number 0151154. all patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study.study populationmale and female patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with ad of mild-to-moderate severity at baseline investigator's global assessment scores of 2 or 3 who exhibited at least one ad lesion of 20 cm2 were eligible for inclusion in the study.15 the location of ad lesions had to allow sampling with the scrub wash method.for the purposes of this study lesional skin was defined as an active lesion of ad an erythematous plaque with or without oozing vesiculation crusting excoriations orerosions but with no overt signs of infection located within the antecubital or popliteal fossae or other region typical of ad.exclusion criteria included severe fungal infection or other skin disease that could affect ad diagnosis any uncontrolled or serious disease or any condition that could interfere with data interpretation or put the patient at significant risk.

patients who did not respect the appropriate wash-out periods for topi- cal and systemic steroids topical and systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics-the use of which was prohibited during the study-before baseline day 1 were also excluded.evaluation of sampling and quantificationmethodsin the first part of the study enrolled patients were assigned to one of the two groups to compare the swab group 1 and scrub wash group 2 sampling methods from a 3 cm diameter o-ring area of an ad lesion.

similar scrub wash sam- plings were performed in patients assigned to group 2. at days 3 and 8 before treatment target lesions were sampled with both the swab and scrub wash methods from adjacent areas of the target lesion to evaluate the reproducibility of the methods.the patients were instructed to avoid bathing for 24 h prior to all sampling time points and avoid showers and emollient on the day of the visit.swab sampling was carried out using a nylon flocked swab eswab 480ce copan italia spa brescia italy dipped in normal saline solution in a 3 cm diameter o-ring.skin microbiota was recovered in 1 ml amies solution copan italia spa brescia italy.

statistical analysis33.5-11.6 years and both genders were equally represented as 16 51.6 of patients were females table 1. the major- ity of patients 80.6 had ad of moderate severity with a mean target lesion local objective scorad of 30.5-8.2 and mean disease duration of 27.1-14.2 years.

target lesions were mostly located on the elbow in 14 45.2 patients and forearm in 7 22.6 patients.

in those patients for whom s. aureus levels decreased in response to ht la1 lotion the minimum s. aureus concentration at day 8 was2.89 log cfucm2.the 16s rrna gene sequencing-based analysis of microbiota composition and diversity was performed on samples from the target lesions of 15 patients at days 8 and28.

also a slight reduc- tion of the shannon diversity index was observed betweentolerabilitywhen applied to the lesional skin of patients with ad ht la1 lotion was found to be well tolerated.discussionseveral clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with ad are more likely to be colonized with s. aureus on lesional skin than healthy controls although the prevalence ofaureus colonization varies among studies.9 these variations are likely to be due to differences in the studied populations e.g.

of note patients who responded best to treatment were those with higher s. aureus counts at the time the lotion was first applied day 8. indeed a level of 2.89 log cfucm2 in the ad target lesion appeared to be the minimum s. aureus load required to observe a response to ht la1 lotion suggest- ing that this lotion may be useful for patients with particularlyhigh levels of s. aureus colonization.

colonization by s. aureus increases the easi and the number of appointments by patients with atopic dermatitis cohort with 93 patients.
