In support of the hypothesis that alterations of intestinal micro- biota composition and barrier function may be critical in the development and progression of NAFLD results of several animal studies using different diets to induce NAFLD have shown that interventions affecting intestinal microbiota composition and barrier function can pre- vent the development of NAFLD -.

LBP lipopolysaccharide-binding protein sCD14 soluble CD14 NAFLD non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Concentration of proinflammatory markers in serum and plasma of controls and children with early signs of NAFLDBoth PAI-1 activity in plasma 3.3-fold p  0.05 and CRP serum levels 2-foldp  0.05 were significantly higher in children with early signs of NAFLD than in controls.

This does not alter the authors' adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.elevated further suggesting that intestinal barrier dysfunction might be present already in the initial phases of the disease.IntroductionBy now non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is one of the most frequently diagnosed liver diseases worldwide not only in adults but also in children and adolescents  .
