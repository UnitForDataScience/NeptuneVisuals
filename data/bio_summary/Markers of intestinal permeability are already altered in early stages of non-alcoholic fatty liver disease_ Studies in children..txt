In addition liver transaminase activity alanine aminotransferase ALT and aspartate aminotransferase AST in serum to determine liver status as well as serum triglyc- erides total cholesterol HDL and LDL cholesterol and fasting glucose concentrations were analyzed by a routine laboratory Sindelfingen Germany.Anthropometric data blood pressure and markers of insulin resistanceBody weight height waist circumference blood pressure and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance HOMA-IR were measured as detailed by Maier et al.

In support of the hypothesis that alterations of intestinal micro- biota composition and barrier function may be critical in the development and progression of NAFLD results of several animal studies using different diets to induce NAFLD have shown that interventions affecting intestinal microbiota composition and barrier function can pre- vent the development of NAFLD -.

LBP lipopolysaccharide-binding protein sCD14 soluble CD14 NAFLD non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Concentration of proinflammatory markers in serum and plasma of controls and children with early signs of NAFLDBoth PAI-1 activity in plasma 3.3-fold p  0.05 and CRP serum levels 2-foldp  0.05 were significantly higher in children with early signs of NAFLD than in controls.

This does not alter the authors' adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.elevated further suggesting that intestinal barrier dysfunction might be present already in the initial phases of the disease.IntroductionBy now non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is one of the most frequently diagnosed liver diseases worldwide not only in adults but also in children and adolescents  .

However despite intense research efforts molecular mechanism involved have not yet been clarified and accepted interventions to prevent or cure NAFLD in children adolescents and adults other than lifestyle modifications are not available .Results of studies in adults with NAFLD suggested already almost 30 years ago that alter- ations of intestinal microbiota and permeability might be critical in the later stages of NAFLDfibrosis and cirrhosis .

To further delineate if an increased translocation of bacterial endotoxin may add to the onset of NAFLD we assessed markers of intestinal permeability in prepubertal children age 10 years showing early signs of NAFLD e.g.

suggest that chil- dren with NAFLD have a higher risk to develop end-stage liver diseases and a higher mortality rate .

However despite only showing very early signs of NAFLD and in line with findings of others   prevalence of fatty liver stage 1 in children was associated with higher blood pressure beginning insulin resistance and dyslipidemia as well as increased levels of active PAI-1 CRP IL-6 TNF a and leptin.
