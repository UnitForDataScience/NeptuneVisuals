starch may be nondigestible either because it is trapped within whole plant cell matrices rs1 the starch granules are resistant rs2 the starch is retrograded rs3 or the starch is chemically modified rs4 35. the level of rs rs2 is low in common cereal starches with an amylose content of 20-30 typically for those presented in table 1 whereas high-amylose starch types may contain higher levels 36. rs as rs3 canalso be formed in connection with the cooling process of a starch gel after heating 36.branched and unbranched fructans consist of one glu- cose unit linked to a varying number of fructose units 3-20 present predominantly in the endosperm and germ tissues 37. the concentration of fructans among wg cereals varies by a factor of 30 and is lowest in rice and oats and highest in rye table 1. the concentration of the fructans in brans of rye and wheat is also higher than of the flour and wg.cinnamic and benzoic acidscinnamic acid derivatives found in cereals are ferulic acid caffeic acid p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid whereastable 1. df composition of wg refined flour and bran from wheat and rye and wg from oats corn and ricedata from refs.

white wheat bread and long-time exposure to high-gi foods can challenge the homeostatic regulation systems involving insulin glucagon glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent in- sulinotropic polypeptide and lead to a number of events that stimulate hunger promote fat deposition and place the pan- creatic f3 cells under increased stress 19 90 91. lowered postprandial glycaemia in response to certain wg cereal products or suppressed insulin responses in the case of rye may contribute to the metabolic benefits of a wg diet 92-94 as may the lower energy density and higher volume of meals rich in wg products as these are factors favoring satiation.

the content of total lignin was higher in the rye 2500- 6700 ug100 g than in wheat 340-2270 ug100 g and oat 820-2550 ug100 g samples 45. the variations were mainly caused by the genetic differences but in rye also environmen- tal conditions affected the lignin content through grain size as smaller grains of rye had significantly lower total lignin sy- ringaresinol and lariresinol contents than larger grains 45. as it is the case with the cinnamic and benzoic acids deriva-tives the bran contains substantially much higher concentra- tions of lignans than is the case with wg and particularly the refined flour table 2.df phenolic phytochemicals and the digestion processes in the small intestinedfthe df fraction represents the part of carbohydrates along with lignin not digested by the endogenous enzymes secreted to or present in the small intestine 46 47. nevertheless df can influence the digestion and absorption processes in the stomach and small intestine due to its physical presence and physiochemical properties fig.

cereal bran germ and endosperm showed an indepen- dent association only with the bran component thus demon- strating that bran is a key factor in determining wg health benefits 61213. the underlying physiological mechanisms behind the protective effects of wg however remain largely unknown in spite of several attempts to elucidate them in controlled dietary intervention studies using biochemical as- says 14-16 as well as nontargeted metabolomics 17 18. therefore the biochemical mechanisms behind the health benefits of wg still remain speculative but can most likely be ascribed to a concerted action of df and a wide variety of phytochemicals phenolic compounds carotenoids vitamin e sterols and phytates 2 19. an additive and synergistic action of these biologically active components as was found in an animal study with extreme diet combinations e.g.

nev- ertheless intervention 86 87 cross-sectional 88 89 and animal studies 68 have all shown higher plasma and where measured urine concentrations when consuming wg cere- als compared to refined flour.physiological effects and potential health effects of metabolites of df and phenolic phytochemicalsthe positive health effects of wg cereals as identified in epi- demiological studies are most likely caused by df and the wide array of compounds present in the wg and almost ab- sent in refined flour.

oat bran is a concentrated source of the aleurone and subaleurone layers and with a high concentration of f3-glucan 23 and wheat aleurone is a concentrated source of arabinoxylan ax along with phenolic phytochemicals 3. the main wg cereals con- sumed worldwide are wheat rice and maize followed by oats rye barley triticale millet and sorghum 1. wheat and rye are largely consumed as soft and crisp bread but also as breakfast cereals whereas the other cereal grains are mostly consumed as breakfast cereals porridges or cooked staples.df and phenolic phytochemicals in cerealsdfthe df fraction of cereals consists of nonstarch polysaccha- rides nsp resistant starch rs oligosaccharides mostly fructans and the noncarbohydrate polyphenolic ether lignin.
