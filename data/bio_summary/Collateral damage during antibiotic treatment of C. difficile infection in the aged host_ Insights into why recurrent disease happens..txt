Despite this obvious difference in pathogene- sis a study using gnotobiotic piglet model has shown clinical outcome and histopathologic changes similar to human disease.The piglet model has also recently been used to test the utility of anti-toxin antibody therapy in CDI.This new model presents another good methodology to study effects of therapeutic agents as it closely resembles human disease in the effect of anti-toxin antibody therapy.

It should be noted that there is no single animal model that is best reflective of human disease in CDI at present and while the mouse model is one of the most widely used due to various factors outlined above it is still an imperfect model and is a limitation of this study.
