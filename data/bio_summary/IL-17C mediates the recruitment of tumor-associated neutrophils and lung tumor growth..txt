il-17c was identified as a negative prognostic factor in human non-small-cell lung cancer nsclc.resultstlr-24 mediates nthi-induced pulmonary inflammation and tumor growthwe and others have shown that bacterial pathogens promote metastatic and lc growth.to study the function of tlrs in tumor-associated inflammation and tumor growth lewis lung carcinoma llc cells were injected in wild-type wt mice and mice double deficient for tlr-2 and tlr-4.

tumor proliferation and growth were significantly reduced in csnthi- exposed il-17c-  - mice 14 days after injection of llc cells supplementary figure s1a and b. the number of ly6b cells was significantly decreased in lung tumors of csnthi-exposed il-17c-  - mice compared with those of csnthi-exposed wt mice supplementary figure s1c.

exposure to nthi resulted in a significantly increased expression of il-17c in wt mice whereas the nthi- induced expression of il-17c was significantly decreased in the lungs of tlr-24-  - mice 3b.to study the function of il-17c in inflammation-induced tumor growth we injected llc cells in wt mice and in mice deficient for il-17c.

a macroscopic and microscopic pathology hematoxylin and eosin stain numbers of tumor nodules detectable on the lung surface and tumor area from total lung area were determined 21 days after the injection of llc cells n  6 for airwt airtlr-24-  - nthitlr-24-  - and n  7 for nthiwt.

moreover concentrations of the neutrophilic cytokines keratinocyte-derived chemokine kc and macrophage inflamma- tory protein 2 mip-2 were significantly reduced in bronchoalveo- lar lavage bal fluids of cancer-free tlr-24-  - mice 24 h after nthi exposure 3a.il-17c mediates nthi-induced recruitment of tumor-associated neutrophils and tumor growthit has been shown that tlrs mediate the epithelial expression of il-17c and that il-17c promotes the recruitment of neutrophils into tissues.we analyzed the nthi-induced expression of il-17c in whole lung tissue of cancer-free wt tlr-24-  - and il-17c-  - mice.

the number of ly6b cells was significantly decreased in the lung parenchyma of nthi-exposed il-17c-  - mice compared with nthi-exposed wt mice 3e.

nodule numbers and lung area covered by tumor were significantly decreased in the lungs of nthi-exposed il-17c-  - mice compared with nthi-exposed wt mice 4c.

there was no difference in the tumor-associated inflam- mation and tumor burden between air-exposed wt and il-17c-  - mice at early stages of lc development and however nthi-induced inflammation resulted in a significantly increased recruitment of ly6b cells into tumor tissue in wt mice but not in il-17c-  - mice 14 days after injection of llc cells 3c.
