IL-17C was identified as a negative prognostic factor in human non-small-cell lung cancer NSCLC.RESULTSTLR-24 mediates NTHi-induced pulmonary inflammation and tumor growthWe and others have shown that bacterial pathogens promote metastatic and LC growth.To study the function of TLRs in tumor-associated inflammation and tumor growth Lewis lung carcinoma LLC cells were injected in wild-type WT mice and mice double deficient for TLR-2 and TLR-4.

Exposure to NTHi resulted in a significantly increased expression of IL-17C in WT mice whereas the NTHi- induced expression of IL-17C was significantly decreased in the lungs of TLR-24-  - mice 3b.To study the function of IL-17C in inflammation-induced tumor growth we injected LLC cells in WT mice and in mice deficient for IL-17C.

Moreover concentrations of the neutrophilic cytokines keratinocyte-derived chemokine KC and macrophage inflamma- tory protein 2 MIP-2 were significantly reduced in bronchoalveo- lar lavage BAL fluids of cancer-free TLR-24-  - mice 24 h after NTHi exposure 3a.IL-17C mediates NTHi-induced recruitment of tumor-associated neutrophils and tumor growthIt has been shown that TLRs mediate the epithelial expression of IL-17C and that IL-17C promotes the recruitment of neutrophils into tissues.We analyzed the NTHi-induced expression of IL-17C in whole lung tissue of cancer-free WT TLR-24-  - and IL-17C-  - mice.

The number of Ly6B cells was significantly decreased in the lung parenchyma of NTHi-exposed IL-17C-  - mice compared with NTHi-exposed WT mice 3e.

Nodule numbers and lung area covered by tumor were significantly decreased in the lungs of NTHi-exposed IL-17C-  - mice compared with NTHi-exposed WT mice 4c.

The number of Ly6B cells was significantly decreased in lung tumors of CSNTHi-exposed IL-17C-  - mice compared with those of CSNTHi-exposed WT mice Supplementary Figure S1C.

There was no difference in the tumor-associated inflam- mation and tumor burden between air-exposed WT and IL-17C-  - mice at early stages of LC development and However NTHi-induced inflammation resulted in a significantly increased recruitment of Ly6B cells into tumor tissue in WT mice but not in IL-17C-  - mice 14 days after injection of LLC cells 3c.
