Indeed two cross-sectional studies have reported that vitamin-D is inversely associated with levels of C-reactive protein a marker of inflammation in psychosis  .Despite all this circumstantial evidence a recent Mendelian causation study  looking at SNPs associated with serum vitamin-D and schizophrenia in 34241 schizophrenia cases and 45604 controls found no evidence for causal effect of vitamin- D on the risk for schizophrenia.

Recent cross genomic studies which addressed the common architecture between schizophrenia and those of other psychiatric and non-psychiatric traits revealed links between schizophrenia and MS .

Intriguingly recent population-based studies found that several psychiatric comorbidities including schizophrenia anxiety depression and bipolar disorder were more common in MS population than in a matched control cohort   as were white matter changes and myelin-related dysfunction in schizophrenia .This work suggests that a subgroup of patients with schizo- phrenia may demonstrate aspects of an autoimmune process.

Injecting pregnant mice with synthetic double-stranded DNA poly IC to mimic viral infec- tionsinterferon responses and lipopolysaccharide a highly inflammatory component of bacterial cell walls elicits mor- phological and behavioral changes characteristic of the brain in schizophrenia  however the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.The autoimmune hypothesis is also strengthened by the finding of increased autoimmune disease in relatives of schizo- phrenic patients and the inverse relationship of schizophrenia with rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue diseases .

A recent meta-analysis of anti-inflammatory medica- tions in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia showed therapeutic effects of fish oils N-acetyl-cysteine and estradiol .viTAMiN-D STuDieS iN SCHiZOPHReNiA PATieNTSSeveral lines of evidence support a role for vitamin-D defi- ciency in the risk for schizophrenia.

These findings added to the evidence that dark-skinned minority groups in cold countries have a greater risk of schizophrenia  have led to the hypothesis that low vitamin-D especially during early life may be implicated in the genesis of schizophrenia .

Thus the evidence suggests that low vitamin-D not only disrupts early brain development but may also compromise later periods of brain growth and maturation.A prospective Finnish birth cohort study looked at one way of addressing this risk and found that vitamin-D supplementation in males during the first year of life resulted in a reduced risk of them later developing schizophrenia .It is therefore plausible that vitamin-D may reduce inflam- mation and enhance resilience to neurobiological or pathogen- induced insults which might increase risk of schizophrenia.

Psychiatry 847. doi In this short review we want to summarize the current findings on the role of vitamin-D in multiple sclerosis MS schizophrenia and autism.

Here we will discuss current evidence exploring the role of vitamin-D in MS schizophrenia and autism and its impact on adaptive and innate immunity antimicrobial defense the microbiome neuroinflammation behavior and neurogenesis.

More work is needed to gain insight into its role in the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions as it may offer attractive means of intervention and prevention.Keywords vitamin-D multiple sclerosis schizophrenia autism immunity microbiomeviTAMiN-D BiOLOGYVitamin-D is a member of the family of steroid hormones together with sex hormones retinoid and cortisol.
