an in- dividual microbiome or the bacteria present in a territory which is expected to result in microbiota differences among individuals rather than that communities are mostly structured by body niche .We aimed in this study to integrate different levels of comparison in a natural wild bird-microbiota system to evaluate the relationships among different animal- associated microbial communities and their association with environmental microbial communities in two sym- patric bird species.

Comparing community resemblance among sample types As a measure of phylogenetic similarity among the various sample types mean pairwise weighted UniFrac distances among sample types varied substantially among all ten pairwise comparisons but this variation was consistent for woodlarks and skylarks.

Instead cloacal commu- nities mostly resembled skin communities skin communi- ties were most similar to feather and soil communities and feather communities mostly resembled skin and nest lining communities.

We compared and visualised OTU co- occurrences among the different sample types using venn diagrams for woodlarks and skylarks separately using the methods provided by the Hallam Lab  R. For both host species separately we identified and described the most abundant OTUs in each bird-associated sample type with a mean abundance threshold of 5 across all samples per sample type using the coremicrobiome function provided by David Elliott  d.In order to identify differential OTU abundance in woo-dlarks and skylarks for each sample type we performed analysis of composition of microbiomes ANCOM  with a critical false discovery rate FDR-corrected q-value of 0.05.Pairwise community similarity between hosts and among sample typesWe assessed bacterial community composition beta di- versity using weighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities to evaluate phylogenetic similarity among groups.

A similar model that included only nest lining and surface soil communities did not reveal such individual differences LRT kh2  0.32 P  0.57 thus demonstrating that Female ID pri- marily predicted richness variation in bird-associated bacterial communities but not among nest-associated communities.OTU co-occurrence patterns between bird- andnest-associated microbiota of woodlarks and skylarks Analysis of OTU co-occurrence patterns showed that 78 80 and 89 of the OTUs identified in cloacal brood patch skin and feathers respectively were shared be- tween woodlarks and skylarks.

Analysis of mean phylogenetic distances between each pair of taxa measured as the mean NRI value per sample type showed a significant de- viation from the null distribution in cloacal communities of woodlarks but not in any other sample type implying that most of the analysed microbial communities were randomly structured deeper in each sample type's phyl- ogeny Figure S7 Additional file .DiscussionCharacterising and comparing the microbiotas of sym- patric woodlarks Lullula arborea and skylarks Alauda arvensis and their nests we found that the bird- associated microbiotas resembled the environmental mi- crobial communities and concluded that lark-associated microbiota were shaped more by horizontal acquisition than by habitat filtering or host-microbiota coevolution- ary history.

However our lark findings are in line with a series of investigations on birds mammals and reptiles that also do not find support for phylosymbiosis and instead demonstrate a lack of interspecific microbiota differences among sympatric species or strong microbiota conver- gence due to sympatry and dietary similarity To cover these studies we propose the 'niche-driven micro- biota assembly hypothesis' as an alternative to the phylosymbiosis-hypothesis stating that host-microbiota as- sociations can be shaped by environmental andor eco- logical factors instead of coevolutionary history.Bird-associated microbiota vary among individuals Differences among individual females explained 18 of the richness and 20 of the community composition based on the three bird-associated sample types but had no explanatory power for the Shannon diversity.

In vertebrates the relationships among host-associated com- munities and connections with environmental communities are understudied despite their alleged role in horizon- tal acquisition .

could provide improved insights in the relationships among microbial communities at various scales.
