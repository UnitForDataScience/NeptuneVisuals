some authors found increased numbers of macrophages in ibd patients10-1618-23 whereas others found reduced numbers2425 and a third group found no differences in the number of cd68 macrophages between cd patients uc patients collagenous colitis patients and normal controls.26 in preliminary studies we found a random distribution of slp cd68 macrophages in biopsies without inflammation in patients with uc crohn's colitis and microscopic colitis but a continu- ous slp band of cd68 macrophages in colonic biop- sies from patients without ibd.27the purpose of the present investigation was to explore the characteristics of the slp band of cd68 macrophages in a larger cohort of colon biopsies without ongoing inflammation in patients with uc in remission ucre and in patients with right-sided crohn's colitis rcc.

the lack of ongoing inflammation in colonic biopsies should rule out the participation of bone marrow- derived iems in the abrogation of the slp macro- phage barrier reported here.keywords cd68 colon crohn's colitis gut microflora macrophages ulcerative colitisintroductionblood leukocytes consist of neutrophils lymphocytes and monocytes.

consistent with their central role in host defence against microorganisms and noxious mole- cules that have breached the epithelium recognition initiates macrophage engulfment killing and degradation of the microflora.2the human colon harbours a vast and complex mixture of different bacteria bacteriophages fungi and viruses gut virome collectively called the gut microbiota.11 several authors have found an alter- ation in the gut microbiota called dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis uc and crohn's dis- ease cd.12-17 according to nakanishi et al.3 the breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier results in the inflow of commensal flora and improper immune responses against the commensal flora lead- ing to inflammatory bowel disease ibd develop- ment.3 following the initiation of an inflammatory response blood monocyte-derived inflammation-elicited inflammatory macrophages iems in tandem with their resident partners play crucial roles in the control of infection by actively pursuing invading microorgan- isms through the uptake degradation and release of inflammatory mediators.7because of the barrier function of macrophages and their bactericidal properties many workers have studied macrophages in ibds.

under normal condi- tions the gut microbiota is dominated by bacteria belonging to two phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes.5 a core set of 50 distinct bacterial species is found.figure 3. colon biopsy from a patient with ulcerative colitis.

in contrast macro- phages show an intense and protracted response to bacteria in uc patients.43 the difference in bacterial clearance is also reflected by the formation of granu- lomas in cd patients but not in uc patients.4445 in the present study granulomas were found in seven cases with crohn's colitis two showed a continuous slp band of cd68 macrophages and of the remain- ing five two had a fragmented slp band of cd68 macrophages and two had a minimal slp band of cd68 macrophages.

consequently no difference was found in the distribution of cd68 cells between cases without or with granulomas in crohn's colitis in this study.in ibd the immune response is initiated by the interaction between antigens and the innate immune system including macrophages and dcs.2546 to pre- vent overt inflammation in response to the gut micro- biota dcs generate primary t-cell responses and mediate intestinal immune tolerance.47 thus not only macrophages but also dcs contribute to pre- vent gut microbiota host invasion.

in contrast nishida et al.26 reported no sig- nificant differences in the numbers of cd68 macrophages between cd patients uc patients col- lagenous colitis patients and controls.

abnormally differen- tiated subsets of intestinal macrophage play a key role in th1- dominant chronic colitis through excess production of il-12 and il-23 in response to bacteria.
