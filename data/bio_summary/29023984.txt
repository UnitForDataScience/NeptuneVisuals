Some authors found increased numbers of macrophages in IBD patients10-1618-23 whereas others found reduced numbers2425 and a third group found no differences in the number of CD68 macrophages between CD patients UC patients collagenous colitis patients and normal controls.26 In preliminary studies we found a random distribution of SLP CD68 macrophages in biopsies without inflammation in patients with UC Crohn's colitis and microscopic colitis but a continu- ous SLP band of CD68 macrophages in colonic biop- sies from patients without IBD.27The purpose of the present investigation was to explore the characteristics of the SLP band of CD68 macrophages in a larger cohort of colon biopsies without ongoing inflammation in patients with UC in remission UCre and in patients with right-sided Crohn's colitis RCC.

The aim was to explore the characteris- tics of the SLP macrophage band in a cohort of biop- sies without inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission UCre and in patients with right- sided Crohn's colitis RCC.Methods and results Endoscopic biopsies were taken from endoscopically normal descending colon in 247 patients 80 with IBD 27 UCre and 53 RCC and 167 without IBD 90 had colonic diarrhoea 63 were enrolled in a colorectal cancer CRC surveillanceprogramme seven had microscopic colitis in remis- sion and seven had miscellaneous colonic ailments.

Partial to complete abrogation of the subepithelial macrophage barrier against the gut microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitisAims The integrity of the band of indigenous macrophages in the subepithelial layer of the lamina propria SLP is crucial in preventing the commensal gut microbiota from attacking the host.

The lack of ongoing inflammation in colonic biopsies should rule out the participation of bone marrow- derived IEMs in the abrogation of the SLP macro- phage barrier reported here.Keywords CD68 colon Crohn's colitis gut microflora macrophages ulcerative colitisIntroductionBlood leukocytes consist of neutrophils lymphocytes and monocytes.

Consistent with their central role in host defence against microorganisms and noxious mole- cules that have breached the epithelium recognition initiates macrophage engulfment killing and degradation of the microflora.2The human colon harbours a vast and complex mixture of different bacteria bacteriophages fungi and viruses gut virome collectively called the gut microbiota.11 Several authors have found an alter- ation in the gut microbiota called dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn's dis- ease CD.12-17 According to Nakanishi et al.3 the breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier results in the inflow of commensal flora and improper immune responses against the commensal flora lead- ing to inflammatory bowel disease IBD develop- ment.3 Following the initiation of an inflammatory response blood monocyte-derived inflammation-elicited inflammatory macrophages IEMs in tandem with their resident partners play crucial roles in the control of infection by actively pursuing invading microorgan- isms through the uptake degradation and release of inflammatory mediators.7Because of the barrier function of macrophages and their bactericidal properties many workers have studied macrophages in IBDs.
