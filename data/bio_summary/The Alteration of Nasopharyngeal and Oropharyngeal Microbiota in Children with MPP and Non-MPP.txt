Association analysis indicates that pneumonia onset is the most significant factor p-value  0.001 Table S2 in explaining variations in microbial samples.OP and NP Microbiota of Patients Differ Significantly from that of Healthy ChildrenGenerally bacterial diversity in NP is lower than in that of OP for all children while the diversity of NP and OP microbiota in patients is also lower than in that of healthy children Figure A. NP and OP microbiota analysis could clearly separate healthy and diseased samples Figure BC.Figure 1.

Respiratory pathogens intrude greatly on the respiratory tract through multiple virulence factors - and evade the immune response of the host  which can induce a proliferation of pathogens and may explain the simpler NP and OP microbiota structure of patients .In addition we observe a higher similarity between NP and OP microbiota in patients which can be explained by a robust intrusion of pathogens through the nasal cavity and the transmission from NP to OP and lung .

In pneumonia patients NP and OP microbiota showed greater similarities between each other suggesting transmission of NP microbiota to the OP.

In this study we would like to answer two questions 1 How does the NP and OP microbiota and the microbiota transmission in URTs of Chinese children with pneumonia differ from that of healthy children2 Are Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia MPP and non-MPP infections associated with different NP and OP microbiota alterationsMaterials and MethodsEthical ApprovalThis study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Shenzhen Children's Hospital with registration number 2016013.

and  represent q-value  0.05 0.01 and 0.001 respectively.Firmicutes predominates both in OP and NP microbiota of all children but accumulates significantly in pneumonia patients OP 63.55 vs. 47.05 in healthy children q-value  0.001 NP 72.09 vs. 43.06 in healthy children q-value  0.001 Table S3.

By contrast Bacteroidetes are enriched in the OP and NP microbiota of healthy children OP 19.64 vs. 5.34 q-value  0.001 NP 7.54 vs. 0.84 q-value  0.001 Table S3.

Proteobacteria accounts for a lower proportion of NP and OP microbiota in patients in comparison with healthy children although this does not have statistical significance.At genus-level Mycoplasma Staphylococcus Lactobacillus Ralstonia Acinetobacter and Actinomyces amass significantly in both the NP and OP microbiota of inpatients while Prevotella is particularly enriched in healthy children Figure D Table S4.

The circle size represents the relative abundance and the density of the dashed line represents the Spearman coefficient.NP and OP Microbiota Pattern of Inpatients Have an Increased Similarity to Each OtherCompared to healthy children the dissimilarity of NP and OP microbiota in patients is considerably smaller Figure A.

For P-33 who suffered the longest hospitalization period 37 days Table S1 a high abundance of M. pneumoniae was identified both in NP and OP microbiota with proportions of 14.51 and 8.48 respectively Figure A Table S5.Staphylococcus warneri is dominant in the NP microbiota of six cases where the patient was diagnosed with an unknown pathogen infection.
