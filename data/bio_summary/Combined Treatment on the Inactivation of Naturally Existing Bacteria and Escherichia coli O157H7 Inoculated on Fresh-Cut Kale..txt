likewise after the combined treatment of 30 or 50 ppm clo2 and mild heat the population of e. coli o157h7 was lower than with the combined treatment of 30 or 50 ppm clo2 and 0.2 cao.

no detection of microorganisms below the detection limit 1 log cfug.which showed a higher reduction of microorganisms on kale leaves than the other concentrations was chosen for the combined treatment with the clo2 solution at 55degc.combined treatment and color quality of kale leavesto develop an appropriate sanitizing method for fresh- cut kale a 30 or 50 ppm clo2 solution combined with 0.2 cao at 55degc was tested on kale leaves.

in addition the inactivation of bacteria by a 50 ppm of clo2 solution in various vegetables and fruits such as sprouts broccoli alfalfa and clover iceberg lettuce rbeludecbheircroiersy hpaaskbceheonisctuhderieryd to2m 1a5toe2s9 s3t2ra-w35be.rwrieesuasned combined treatments of a 30 or 50 ppm clo2 solution withfig.

thus a better antimicrobial effect can be obtained with a combined treatment of clo2 and mild heat.the naturally existing bacterial population on kale leaves treated with a combined treatment of 30 or 50 ppm clo2 and 0.2 cao solution at 55degc was 1.95 and 1.64 log cfug respectively resulting in a reduction of 2.79 and 3.10 log cfug.

the treatment procedure was the same as described above.combined treatmentfor the combined treatment fresh and inoculated kale leaves were treated with 30 or 50 ppm clo20.2 cao 30 or 50 ppm clo2mild heat at 55degc and 30 or 50 ppm clo20.2 caomild heat at 55degc respectively.

for the combined treatment of the clo2 solution with mild heat at 55degc dw was pre-heated to 55degc and a 30 or 50 ppm clo2 solution was added to the pre-heated dw.

24 investigated the efficacy of a 50 ppm clo2 solution for inactivating the total aerobic bacteria and e. coli o157h7 on kale leaves and found that the populations of the total aerobic bacteria and e. coli o17h7 were reduced by 3.07 and 3.15 log cfug respectively compared with the control.

after treatment the samples were air-dried on a laminar flow biosafety hood for 30 min.aqueous chlorine dioxide treatmenta high concentration of an aqueous clo2 solution was prepared by mixing 1 g of sodium chlorite 80 sigma-aldrich usa and 10 ml of 1 n hydrochloric acid in 100 ml of dw followed by agitating with a stirrer at 25degc for 1 h. the prepared clo2 solution was diluted with dw to make different clo2 solution concentrations 10 30 and 50 ppm.

a solution of clo2 and cao was prepared by mixing a 30 or 50 ppm clo2 solution with a 0.2 cao solution to a total volume of 200 ml.

the cao solution 0.2 was pre-heated using a hot plate until the target temperature 55degc was reached and a 30 or 50 ppm clo2 solution was mixed with the pre-heated cao solution.

these results suggest that the combined treatment of clo2 and cao at 55degc provided the best inactivation of microorganisms on fresh- cut kale.after the combined treatment of 30 or 50 ppm clo2 and 0.2 cao at 55degc the hunter color values l a and b of the kale leaves were determined table 2. the color of leafy vegetables is regarded to be an important quality parameter.

overall the combined treatment of 30 or 50 ppm clo2 with mild heat 55degc demonstrated greater microbial reduction than the combination of 30 or 50 ppm clo2 and 0.2 cao.

a combined treatment of 50 ppm clo2 and 0.2 cao at 55degc reduced the population of naturally existing bacteria on kale by 3.10 log colony forming units cfug and the counts of e. coli o157h7 were below the detection limit 1 log cfug.
