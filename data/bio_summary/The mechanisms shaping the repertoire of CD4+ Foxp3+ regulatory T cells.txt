Mice expressing MHC II molecules only on cortical epithelial cells in the thymus showed normal pro- portions of CD4 CD25 T cells in the periphery.30 How- ever a different study reported that deletion of MHC II on CD11chigh dendritic cells reduces the proportions and absolute number of Treg cells.31 Analysis of polyclonal populations of Treg cells in normal mice also found that interactions between TCRs expressed by Treg cells and heterogeneous MHC IIpeptide complexes is required to maintain Treg cells that can recognize organ-specific autoantigens.32 The ability to suppress organ-specific autoimmunity required exposure of Treg cells to natural tissue-derived self-antigens which sustained these cells' phenotype.33 This was also recently confirmed for a natu- ral antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein.11 Finally peripheral antigens were shown to not only sus- tain but also shape the TCR repertoire of Treg cells resid- ing in different anatomical locations.34 Altogether these studies suggest that the spectrum of peptide-MHC II complexes presented in peripheral tissues controls not only Treg cell fitness but also their clonal abundance and diversity.Interactions of peripheral T cells with self ligands have a significant impact to preserve the function and sensitiv- ity of T cells to foreign MHC II peptide ligands.35 Naive peripheral T and Treg cells sustain low-level signalling through their TCRs which varies between T-cell clones and this basal level of recognition of self provides homeo- static cues for both subsets.36 Similarly to thymocytes expression of Nurr77 reporter or CD5 in T cells correlates with increased basal TCR signalling and TCR-f chain phosphorylation and was used to show that mature Treg cells continue to receive stronger signals than naive CD4 T cells.133738 The Treg cells continuously scan peripheral tissues for antigens and in this process they acquire acti- vated phenotype and expand particularly in conditions promoting autoimmunity.3239 Stronger interactions with self-antigens also shape the repertoire of the Treg popula- tion to preserve clones with higher sensitivity potentially predisposing specific Treg cells to be more effective in their surveillance function.37The impact of TCR signalling on individual Treg cells was most convincingly shown in mice where surface expression of TCR on all T cells was eliminated.4041 In contrast to naive CD4 or CD8 T cells the number of peripheral Treg cells has not changed for weeks following TCR-a locus ablation however homeostatic expansion of Treg cells was decreased indicating that TCR signalling is needed for their clonal proliferation but not survival.

One mechanism that evolved to protect against uncon- trolled self-reactivity of developing TCR repertoire includes deletion of self-reactive T cells.1 Another mecha- nism is generation of a specialized regulatory T Treg cell that inhibits activation of peripheral T cells specific for self-antigens and prevents autoimmune diseases.23 This is particularly important because a recent report showed that a sizable proportion of CD4 T cells specific for ubiquitous self antigens are not eliminated by negative selection.4 Regulatory T cells that sustain immune system homeostasis and control immune and inflammatory responses develop in the thymus.

Promiscuous expression of tissue-specific proteins in medullary thymic epithelial cells was found to expose developing thymocytes to a broad range of tissue-specific antigens.25 This ectopic expression of peripheral self-pro- teins that are considered the source of peptide ligands mediating Treg selection is regulated by the transcription factor autoimmune regulator AIRE.2627 Presentation of AIRE-dependent thymic ligands has been associated with clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells but in parallel it also promotes development of Treg cells.28 Examination of autoimmune lesions in AIRE-deficient mice revealed that TCRs expressed by pathogenic effector cells are pref- erentially expressed by Treg cells in wild-type mice.28 This AIRE-dependent recruitment of potentially autoreactive T cells into the pool of Treg cells is considered an impor- tant mechanism to eliminate conventional self-reactive CD4 T cells which enforces tissue-specific tolerance.4 AIRE-dependent generation of Treg cells in the perinatal period is particularly important for preventing autoim- mune disease and where necessary to prevent autoimmu- nity throughout life.29 This latest finding indicates that the neonatal Treg population forms a distinct subset add- ing age as a factor that is important for the Treg cell ontogeny and maintenance of immune tolerance.Recruitment of peripheral Treg cellsHow self-antigens and TCR signals regulate the pool of peripheral Treg cells has also been extensivelyinvestigated.

This instructive model was proposed when it was shown that expression of the self-peptide-MHC complex directed differentiation of thymocyte precursors expressing cognate transgenic TCR into Treg cell lineage.78 Different sensitivity of the Treg precursors and conventional CD4 T cells to posi- tive selection could play the role in this process.9 A two- step model of Treg cell differentiation was later proposed where signals from the TCR induced expression of CD25 and these cells were predestined to up-regulate Foxp3 and become Treg cells under the influence of only IL-2 and without continuing signals from TCR.5 The signals from the TCR which lead to the up-regulation of CD25 areAbbreviations AIRE autoimmune Regulator transcription factor CNS conserved non-coding regulatory sequence IL-2 inter- leukin-2 pTreg peripherally derived regulatory T TCR T-cell receptor Treg regulatory Tvital for Treg cell development and highlight the impor- tance of MHC-peptide ligand complexes in this process.

TCR signalling conveyed by expression of Nur77 reporter showed that Treg cells per- ceive stronger TCR signals than conventional T cells dur- ing thymic development and in the periphery.13 In addition higher affinity of TCR is associated with more efficient recruitment into the Treg population.14 However other data show that TCRs expressed by Treg cells may not be more self-reactive than TCRs expressed by conven- tional CD4 T cells.

CD4 T cell toler- ance to tissue-restricted self antigens is mediated by antigen-specific regulatory T cells rather than deletion.
