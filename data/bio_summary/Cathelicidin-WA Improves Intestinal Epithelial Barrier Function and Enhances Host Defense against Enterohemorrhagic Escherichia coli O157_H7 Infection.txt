To further compare the intestinal barrier function of the mice treated with CWA and Enro we selected mice from the control EHEC plus Enro and EHEC plus CWA groups to reinfect with EHEC O157H7.

SCFA concentrations were normalized to the weight of the cecal contents.Bacterial transfer during second EHEC infectionAfter the mice had been treated as described in the Animals section above six mice from the control EHEC plus Enro and EHEC plus CWA groups were randomly selected.

We consistently found that in Enro-treated mice more bacteria were present in the spleen and liver during the second EHEC infection than was the case in CWA-treated mice suggesting that CWA-treated mice might have a better defense against the second bacterial infection than do antibiotic-treated mice.

B Six mice per group were randomly selected from the control EHEC plus Enro and EHEC plus CWA groups and orally challenged by second EHEC infection.

injection with sterile saline EHEC 5.46 mgkg CWA EHEC plus CWA or 22.75 mgkg enrofloxacin Enro EHEC plus Enro once a day for 3 d. The doses of CWA and Enro were calculated based on our previous study 10.

Compared with the EHEC group the EHEC plus CWA group had an increased villous height and a decreased crypt depth in the jejunum whereas the EHEC plus Enro group had only a decreased crypt depth Fig.

Compared with the EHEC group the EHEC plus CWA group had increased protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the jejunum whereas the EHEC plus Enro group had increased protein expression of only ZO-1.

However EHEC infection or EHEC infection followed by Enro treatment did not affect the Relmb and TFF3 expression in the jejunum of mice.

EHEC.CWA EHEC plus CWA EHEC.Enro EHEC plus Enro.with this finding previous studies have shown that antimicrobial peptides such as porcine b defensin 2 and Cathelicidin-BF attenuate the DSS-induced disruption of mucin expression in the intestine of mice 3 14.

However no significant differences were found between the CWA-treated mice and the untreated mice duringthe second EHEC O157H7 infection.
