according to this hypothesis disruption of intes- tinal microbial equilibrium has the capacity to alter the homeostatic network thereby eliciting deleterious host responses as observed in inflammatory bowel disease and crc.in support of this hypothesis the microbial community varies between tumor and normal flanked tissue in crcpatientsdistal versus proximal tumors and adenoma to adenocarcinoma progression.interestingly differences in luminal intestinal biota may potentially serve as noninva- sive crc biomarkers when paired with either whole genome metagenomicor 16s rrna sequencing analysis.thus a core microbial component likely drives homeostatic signaling and the identification of these microorganisms could prove invaluable for both prevention and therapeutic intervention.

a number of studies using preclinical models colonized with selected bacterial candidates eg fusobacterium nucleatum bacteroides fragilis adherent invasive escherichia coli identified from microbial genomic work have shed light on mechanisms eg inflammation genotoxicity by which bacteria could promote intestinal carcinogenesis-or even modulate therapeutic response in preclinical models.despite this however the evidence for the microbial community as a whole playing a functional role in intestinal carcinogenesis is unclear.

finally a number of oncogenic factors such as aurora kinase a cell division cycle 20 and b lymphoma mo-mlv insertion region 1 homolog bmi1 were induced in colonic tissues of mice associated with crc biota compared with healthy biota.these findings have established the functional impact of the microbial community on the development ofintestinal carcinogenesis and have identified a potential microbial carcinogenic core.

because a longitudinal microbial composition study was not performed in this cohort the stability of the transplanted microbial com- munity is unknown.

in this issue of gastroenterology wong et aldemonstrated the carcino- genic properties of microbial communities obtained from crc patients using fecal microbiota transfers into preclin- ical models .in this study the authors used 2 different approaches to dissect the impact of biota on intestinal carcinogenesis wild-type mice treated with wide spectrum antibiotics and then exposed to the procarcinogenic compound axozy- methane aom and germ-free mice both models colo- nized with stools from a pool of either 5 crc patients or 5 healthy controls.

moreover microbial organization such as biofilm forming commu- nities may also be an important component of carcino- genesis because 90 of right-sided tumors contain a biofilm positive community compared with 15 of left-sided tumors.therefore understanding the functional impact of these microorganisms in carcinogenesis would be important.

it is likely that the microbial consortia impacts various steps along the carcinogenesis process.

for example wong et alshowed that relative abundance of p anaerobius and f nucleatum increased in the crc carcinogenic biota with the former taxa activating toll-like receptor 2 and toll-like receptor 4 signaling to promote dysplastic lesions in aom-exposed wild-type miceand the latter altering crc chemothera- peutic response.finally limited understanding is available regarding the mechanisms by which microbial composition differsfigure 1. colorectal can- cer crc biota promotes neoplastic lesions after oral transfer into mice.

microbial composition present in the stools of mice reveals increased relative abundance of bacterial species forming networks in crc patients.

environmental and dietary factors in conjunction with host genetics are likely contributing to microbial function.

clearly more information is needed about mechanisms through which the microbial community both promotes and prevents carcino- genesis.

for example intestinal bacterial communities have been associated with patho- logic conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases colorectal cancer obesity and liver cirrhosis by 16s rrna gene or whole genome metagenomic sequencing analysis.

interestingly germ-free mice associated with crc or healthy biota for up to 32 weeks failed to develop polyps although increased intestinal proliferation was observed in the crc biota condition when compared with healthy controls as measured by pnca staining.

accordingly abun- dance of cd4th interferon-gth th1 and cd4th il-17th th17 immune cells in intestinal tissues was significantly increased in mice colonized with crc biota compared with healthy biota control mice.
