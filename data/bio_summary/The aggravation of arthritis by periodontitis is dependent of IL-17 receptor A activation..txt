Experimental designThe C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into four groups n  5 in each control C group including non-infected naive mice thatreceived oral inoculations of 2 carboxymethylcellulose CMC ex- perimental arthritis AR group including mice submitted to AIA with methylated bovine serum albumin mBSA periodontal disease PD group consisting of mice infected with P. gingivalis oral inoculations of 108 colony-forming units CFU per day for 5 days starting 1 day prior to the final immunisation and the ARPD group which were sub- mitted to AIA followed by P. gingivalis inoculation starting 1 day be- fore the final immunisation.

This is in line with previous reports that have shown an increased Th17 population under P. gingivalis stimuli in both mice and humans Cheng Hughes  Taams 2014 Monteiro et al.

However the effect of oral P. gingivalis infection or other oral periodontal pathogens on gut microbiota remains unclear in addi- tion to the other possible mechanisms by which P. gingivalis prime the host response at distal sites affecting the arthritis outcome.Additionally further studies are necessary to elucidate whether P. gingivalis presents an arthritogenic antigen in addition to inducing a Th17 profile and whether T cell cross-reactivity to P. gingivalis- derived epitopes and joint-derived antigens also participate in the aggravation of arthritis.Taken together our data demonstrate the pathogenic role of peri- odontal infection with P. gingivalis on the aggravation of arthritis medi- ated by increased Th17 articular production of IL-17 and activation of IL-17RA which underlie the increase in neutrophil infiltration into the joints and ultimately affect arthritis progression.These data support the importance of early periodontitis manage- ment in RA patients as well as reinforcing the role of modulation of the Th17IL17 axis in the AIA model as a mechanism for the influence ofP.
