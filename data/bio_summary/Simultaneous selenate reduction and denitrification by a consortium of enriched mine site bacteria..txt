eSimultaneous selenate reduction and denitrification by a consortium of enriched mine site bacteriaGaurav Subedi Jon Taylor Ido Hatam Susan A. BaldwinChemical and Biological Engineering University of British Columbia 2360 East Mall Vancouver British Columbia V6T 1Z3 Canadah i g h l i g h t s A consortium of bacteria reduced selenate and nitrate simultaneously.Selenate reduction rate was not inhibited by nitrate concentration.Selenate reducing culture bacteria were Pseudomonas Lysinibacillus and Thaurea related.Selenate and nitrate reducing cultures included Exiguobacterium and Tissierella.Genome analysis suggested the presence of putative selenate reductases.a r t i c l e i n f oArticle historyReceived 3 March 2017 Received in revised form 23 May 2017Accepted 24 May 2017Available online 25 May 2017 Handling Editor T.

The lag phase lends support to the second hypothesis that de- nitrifiers were present initially at low relative abundance and were only able to reduce nitrate once they had acclimatized and achieved enough growth to impact the nitrate concentration.

The addition of another electron acceptor not only changed the composition but also increased the diversity of the communityTable 3Statistical analysis results for the response surface model generated using second order analysis of variance ANOVA of the central composite design experiment with the Mine 2 natural marsh SeRB enrichment grown in media containing different initial Se and nitrate concentrations see  k1 for SeR was the dependent variable and total dissolved Se and nitrate concentrations were the independent variables.

The kinetic rate constant was independent of initial nitrate concentration over the range 3e143 mg L-1-NO-3 -N. The initial concentration of selenate inhibited selenate reduction kinetics over the range 1e24 mg-Se L-1.Dominant taxa that grew in selenate only medium were classified in the genera Pseudomonas Lysi- nibacillus and Thauera.

This indicated that either the enriched SeRB were capable of reducing nitrate as well as selenate or alternatively other microorganisms in the enrichment that survived in the high selenate concentrations were using nitrate as an electron acceptor.

Relative abundance expressed as fragments per kilobase per million FPKM of ORFs related to periplasmic nitrate reductase NapA was much greater than for membrane-bound nitrate reductase NarG.

The resulting SeRB enrichment was tested for its efficacy at reducing selenate in the presence of nitrate since the latter is a common co- contaminant of mine-influenced water particularly at Mine 2 .

The effect of nitrate concentration on Se reduction was not statistically significant but higher con- centrations of initial selenate-Se had a negative effect on SeRR p  0.001 confirming the qualitative observations made earlier.

The Mine 2 natural marsh selenate enrichment culture SeRB was used to study selenate reduction in the presence of varying concentrations of nitrate.

The samples were incubated again in a water bath at 56 oC for 1 h. The samples were briefly vortexed every 15 min to increase the efficiency of DNA extraction.
