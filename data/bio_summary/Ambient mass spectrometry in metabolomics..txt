dart-ms has also been used for animal fat authen- tication based on the triacylglycerol profiles used to build a linear discriminant model for classification164 as well as for olive oil authenticity assessment and adulteration screening.165 tm-dart-ms has been shown to be able to effectively ionize triacylglycerols diacylglycerols and free fatty acids in vegetable oils during their thermally-induced oxidation.165 dart mass spectra and pca were used to assess compositional differences between heated and non-heated vegetable oil samples.166 by means of tm-dart-ms vegetable oils phytosterol enriched margarines butters and animal oil were satisfactorily differen- tiated with characteristic ions for each sample type allowing for sample classification based on phytosterol profiles.167additional metabolomics studies on food have been performed using reims desi-ms and easi-ms. reims allowed for rapid lipidomic profiling of food grade meat products a pca-lda model successfully classified animal tissues with different anatomical origins breeds and species.168 desi-ms was proved to be a fast and simple technique for the detection and analysis of triglycerides in oil- or fat contain- ing food samples.169 easi-ms allowed quality control of amazonian vegetable oils based on triacylglycerol finger- prints170 and was used for quality control of vegetable and animal fats.171summary and perspectiveambient ms techniques have shown great capabilities and unique contributions in metabolomics studies in recent years.the ability to analyze samples in real time without the need for extensive sample preparation offers a unique opportunity to better understand the metabolism of a variety of species and subspecies where high throughput sampling is desirable.

1. the most important aspect of any metabolomics study is a careful definition of the scientific questions to be addressed the experimental design and the sample collection protocols.these factors will determine which metabolomics approach is best suited.48 examples of metabolomics studies include finding differences between complex samples and disease- related metabolic changes the identification or validation of potential biomarkers the investigation of a treatment effect longitudinal studies etc.

new opportunities are now available through the use of ambient ms. for example desi-ms and extractive electrospray ionization ms eesi-ms a technique involving the confluence of two electro- spray streams were used to analyze the central carbon meta- bolites in e. coli extracts.118 by means of tandem ms experi- ments 13 of the 17 central carbon metabolites were identified from uniformly labeled and unlabeled metabolites in the quenched supernatant.119 desi-ms has also been used to generate highly reproducible mass spectra in situ from whole bacterial cells with essentially no sample preparation.120 anuntargeted study differentiated bacteria species and strainsin situ using desi-ms with high reproducibility.120 dart has also been successfully applied to bacterial identification through fatty acid methyl ester profiles of membrane lipids.121 other studies have used nanodesi or lmj-ssp to investigate microbial colonies in real time.

there are also a few review articles that have highlighted how ms tech- niques play a useful role in bioanalysis and metabolomics with some focus on ambient ms.6465 complementing these this review outlines some of the benefits and limitations of applying ambient ms in metabolomics studies by highlighting represen- tative publications on the large swath of published applications.healthhealth-related metabolomics research is one of the most important areas that have benefited from ambient-ms develop- ments taking advantage of the ability to analyze samples in situ in vivo and in real time with minimal preparation.

discrimination of tissue samples was also achieved successfully with desi-ms to compare ts-ms results although different ionic species were responsible for sample class separation.66laesi-mssimilar to desi-ms laesi is a commercially-available and rou- tinely used technique in ambient-msi.

it provides a discussion of a selection of ambient ms applications in metabolomics reported until december 2016. key examples of these applications have been grouped accord- ing to research areas in which the ambient ms field has had more impact on metabolomics to date i.e.

literature searches performed independently by the authors using keywords such as ambient mass spectrometry or mass spectrometry and metabolomics found as anticipated5 that the number of publications on ambient ms-based metabolomics applications has sharply increased in the last 4 years.

several strategies for coupling dart-ms to multivariate stat- istical models for high-throughput metabolomics analysis of blood sera have been reported in the literature including transmission mode sampling to increase reproducibility with lower risk of cross contamination.2471114115the combination of dart- or desi-ms with nuclear mag- netic resonance nmr spectroscopy has proved to be a power- ful platform in health metabolomics.

122 with permission from the national academy of sciences c2012.plant biology and agriculturemany reviews have explored and documented the usefulness of metabolomics for understanding plant biology.128-132 one of the earlier studies using ambient ionization techniques for plant metabolomics focused on in situ analysis of alkaloids with desi.133 various parts seeds stems leaves roots and flowers of the poisonous plants studied namely poison hemlock conium maculatum jimsonweed datura stramo- nium and deadly nightshade atropa belladonna were directly analyzed via desi-ms and msms without any treatment or extraction.

increasing its popular- ity in metabolomics ambient ms offers limited sample preparation rapid and direct analysis of liquids solids and gases in situ and in vivo analysis and imaging.

despite the obvious benefits challenges center on the fact that metabolomics studies require complex data interpretation methods and complex analytical workflows involving sample preparation.the metabolome is estimated to be comprised of thou- sands to tens of thousands of chemically-diverse metabolites with a wide dynamic concentration range and the number of observed metabolites is dependent on the analytical platform.

ambient ms allows for the direct soft ionization of metabolites surface sampling and in situ analysis in real time in the ambient environment with little to no sample preparation.56this review discusses the benefits and limitations of imple- menting ambient ms techniques in a variety of metabolomics studies.
