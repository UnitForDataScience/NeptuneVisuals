these results show that cra-cm prepared from heat-killed r. albus at concentrations of 107 cfuml and 108 cfuml significantly attenuated cytotoxicity in oxidatively stressed sh-sy5y cells in particular h2o2-induced oxidative stress was greatly atten- uated by treatment with cra-cm prepared from heat-killed r. albus at a concentration of 108 cfuml.anti-apoptotic effects of cra-cm in oxidatively stressed sh-sy5y cells.

towards this end conditioned medium cra-cm was prepared using caco-2 cells treated with heat-killed r. albus and cell proliferation and cell protection against oxidative stress were measured in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells treated with cra-cm.

the cell viability measurements were 106.9 - 9.37110.0 - 4.55 and 111.5 - 3.34 in cells treated with cra-cm prepared with heat-killed r. albus at concentra- tions of 106 cfuml 107 cfuml and 108 cfuml respectively compared with the negative control 100. the cell viability significantly increased in cells treated with cra-cm prepared with heat-killed r. albus at con- centrations of 107 cfuml and 108 cfuml compared with the negative control.

in the ldh assay cra-cm didnot show any significant cytotoxicity in sh-sy5y cells at any of the concentrations used in this study.effects of cra-cm on cell proliferation-associated factors in sh-sy5y cells.

expression levels of srf a transcription factor that plays an important role in cellular differentiation and cell cycle regulation increased in the cells treated with cra-cm that was produced with heat-killed r. albus at concentrations of 106 cfuml 0.98 - 0.16-fold 107 cfuml 1.19 - 0.15-fold and 108 cfuml 1.54 - 0.06-fold compared with the negative control especially a significant increase was shown in the cells treated with cra-cm produced with heat-killed r. albus at a concentration of 108 cfuml fig.

c-fos a known ieg immediate-early gene increased in the cells treated with cra-cm that was produced with heat-killed r. albus at concentrations of 106 cfuml 0.95 - 0.39-fold 107 cfuml 1.58 - 0.27-fold and 108 cfuml 2.37 - 0.41-fold compared with the negative control especially a significant increase was shown in the cells treated with cra-cm produced with heat-killed r. albus at a concentration of 108 cfu ml fig.

cdk2 also known as cell division protein kinase 2 increased in the cells treated with cra-cm that was produced with heat-killed r. albus at concentrations of 106 cfuml 1.65 - 0.34-fold 107 cfuml 1.38 - 0.22-fold and 108 cfuml 2.09 - 0.07-fold compared with the negative control especially the cellsfigure 2. effects of cra-cm on the expression of srf c-fos and cdk2 in sh-sy5y cells.

bdnf levels in cra-cm from 106 cfuml 107 cfuml and 108 cfuml r. albus increased 1.78- 2.05- and 2.04-fold respectively compared with the negative control.effects of cra-cm on expression of b-tubulin in sh-sy5y cells.

the protein expression levels of b-tubulin significantly increased in the cells treated with cra-cm produced with heat-killed r. albus at a concentration of 108 cfuml.neuroprotective effects of cra-cm on oxidatively stressed sh-sy5y cells.

the viability of cells oxidatively stressed with h2o2 74.93 - 11.68 increased to82.61 - 10.88 92.70 - 8.97 and 94.76 - 5.68 under co-treatment with cra-cm from 106 cfuml 107figure 3. mrna expression of bdnf in caco-2 cells treated with heat-killed r. albus a and bdnf levels in cra-cm b. the relative levels of mrna expression were normalized using gapdh as an internal control.

sh-sy5y cells were pretreated with cra-cm for 4 h and then treated with h2o2 200 mm for 12 h. the number of apoptotic cells increased under h2o2 treatment and the number of shrunk and fragmented nuclei increased in cells treated with h2o2 alone compared with thefigure 5. neuroprotective effects of cra-cm on cell viability in oxidatively stressed sh-sy5y cells.

however pretreatment with cra-cm significantly decreased the baxbcl-2 ratio and bax protein expression indicating that cra-cm exhibits a neuroprotective effect in oxidatively stressed sh-sy5y cells.the issue of safety is very important in the administration of microbial agents.

to investigate these effects conditioned medium was prepared using caco-2 cells cultured with heat-killed r. albus cra-cm.

caco-2 cells cultured with heat-killed r. albus showed increased bdnf expression and bdnf protein levels increased in cra-cm.

cra-cm up-regulated the protein expression levels of srf c-fos and cdk2.
