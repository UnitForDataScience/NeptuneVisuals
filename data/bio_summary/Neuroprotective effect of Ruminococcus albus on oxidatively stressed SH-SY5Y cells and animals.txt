These results show that CRA-CM prepared from heat-killed R. albus at concentrations of 107 CFUmL and 108 CFUmL significantly attenuated cytotoxicity in oxidatively stressed SH-SY5Y cells in particular H2O2-induced oxidative stress was greatly atten- uated by treatment with CRA-CM prepared from heat-killed R. albus at a concentration of 108 CFUmL.Anti-apoptotic effects of CRA-CM in oxidatively stressed SH-SY5Y cells.

Towards this end conditioned medium CRA-CM was prepared using Caco-2 cells treated with heat-killed R. albus and cell proliferation and cell protection against oxidative stress were measured in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with CRA-CM.

In the LDH assay CRA-CM didnot show any significant cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells at any of the concentrations used in this study.Effects of CRA-CM on cell proliferation-associated factors in SH-SY5Y cells.

Expression levels of SRF a transcription factor that plays an important role in cellular differentiation and cell cycle regulation increased in the cells treated with CRA-CM that was produced with heat-killed R. albus at concentrations of 106 CFUmL 0.98 - 0.16-fold 107 CFUmL 1.19 - 0.15-fold and 108 CFUmL 1.54 - 0.06-fold compared with the negative control especially a significant increase was shown in the cells treated with CRA-CM produced with heat-killed R. albus at a concentration of 108 CFUmL Fig.

C-fos a known IEG immediate-early gene increased in the cells treated with CRA-CM that was produced with heat-killed R. albus at concentrations of 106 CFUmL 0.95 - 0.39-fold 107 CFUmL 1.58 - 0.27-fold and 108 CFUmL 2.37 - 0.41-fold compared with the negative control especially a significant increase was shown in the cells treated with CRA-CM produced with heat-killed R. albus at a concentration of 108 CFU mL Fig.

BDNF levels in CRA-CM from 106 CFUmL 107 CFUmL and 108 CFUmL R. albus increased 1.78- 2.05- and 2.04-fold respectively compared with the negative control.Effects of CRA-CM on expression of b-tubulin in SH-SY5Y cells.

The protein expression levels of b-tubulin significantly increased in the cells treated with CRA-CM produced with heat-killed R. albus at a concentration of 108 CFUmL.Neuroprotective effects of CRA-CM on oxidatively stressed SH-SY5Y cells.

The viability of cells oxidatively stressed with H2O2 74.93 - 11.68 increased to82.61 - 10.88 92.70 - 8.97 and 94.76 - 5.68 under co-treatment with CRA-CM from 106 CFUmL 107Figure 3. mRNA expression of BDNF in Caco-2 cells treated with heat-killed R. albus A and BDNF levels in CRA-CM B.

However pretreatment with CRA-CM significantly decreased the BaxBcl-2 ratio and Bax protein expression indicating that CRA-CM exhibits a neuroprotective effect in oxidatively stressed SH-SY5Y cells.The issue of safety is very important in the administration of microbial agents.

To investigate these effects conditioned medium was prepared using Caco-2 cells cultured with heat-killed R. albus CRA-CM.
