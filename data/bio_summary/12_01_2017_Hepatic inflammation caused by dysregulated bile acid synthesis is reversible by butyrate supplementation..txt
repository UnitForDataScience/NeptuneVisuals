In contrast to the whole body FXR KO mice hepatocyte-specific FXR KO mice do not spontaneously develop liver cancer and intestinal FXR KO mice are protected from diet-induced obesityand fatty liver 12 -14.

WD intake increased the body weight and caused hepatomegaly in both WT and FXR KO mice Figure 1B C. Serum lipopolysaccharide LPS concentration was higher in FXR KO mice than in WT mice when they consumed a WD Figure 1D.

Together butyrate exerts anti-inflammatory effects in the liver and colon.The effect of butyrate-deficient feces and butyrate supplementation on the development of hepatitisBecause WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the most severe hepatic inflammation the feces of 15-month-old male WD-fed FXR KO mice which lacked butyrate-generating bacteria were orally trans- planted to 7-month-old male WD-fed FXR KO mice with or without butyrate supplementation.

Consistently FXR knockout KO mice that have dysregulated BA synthesis develop hepatitis and liver cancer spontaneously and using cholestyra- mine to deplete BAs prohibits hepatic tumorigenesis in FXR KO mice 7 - 11.

P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsHepatitis and tumor formation in WD-fed FXR KO miceWhen mice were 15 months old both WD-fed WT and CD-fed FXR KO male mice had hepatitis Figure 1A and supplementary material Figure S1A.

Additionally flow cytometry data revealed that WD-fed FXR KO mice had substantially increased splenic TNF macrophage abundance indicating systemic inflamma- tion Figure 1E.The effect of diet and FXR status on hepatic and gut inflammatory signalingWD and FXR inactivation significantly increased the hepatic mRNA levels of chemokine ligand 17 Ccl17 ligand 20 Ccl20 and ligand 2 Ccl2 and WD-fed FXR KO mice had the highest levels Figure 2A.

Moreover the increased Ccna2 cyclin A2 mRNA was found in both WD-fed and FXR KO mice and WD-fed FXR KO mice had the highest Ccna2 mRNA level implying increased proliferation.

Moreover there was an impressive increase of Desulfovibrionaceae and Bacteroidaceae which rose from 1 in WT mice to 10 in FXR KO mice.

Wild-type WT and FXR knockout KO male mice were placed on a control CD or western diet WD for 15 months.

In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months.
