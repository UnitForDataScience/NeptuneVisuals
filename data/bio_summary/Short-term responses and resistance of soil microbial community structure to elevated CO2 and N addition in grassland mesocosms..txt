in contrast previous grassland studies have reported inconsistent responses of soil microbial commu- nity structure to elevated carbon dioxide co2 elevated co2 had either no effect on microbial community structure ebersberger et al.

guenet et al.

in theory increases in the fungalbacterial ratio driven by decreased soil n availability under elevated co2 could be offset by n addition especially in n-limited ecosystems lagomarsino et al.

however micro- bial community responses to simultaneous increases in n and co2 have attracted little attention to date gutknecht field and balser .the response of soil microbial communities to global changes may be mediated by the plant community via changes in plant biomass or plant-induced changes in soil resource availability such as labile c or mineral n contents bardgett freeman and ostle  gutknecht field and balser  drigo et al.

numerous studies suggest that k-strategist microor- ganisms are more resistant to global change induced distur- bances de vries and shade  bischoff et al.

zhang et al.

previ- ous work published on this mesocosm experiment has shown that soil microbial processes related to c and n cycling were al- tered by the combined effects of elevated co2 and n addition niboyet et al.

and that the abundance of nitrifiers was al- tered by experimental treatments simonin et al.

the treatments were initiated 1 month after sow- ing when the d. glomerata seedlings had fully emerged ni- boyet et al.
