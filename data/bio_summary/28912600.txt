1.large companies have been open to making initial investments in the field in the form of product-related deals with biotech companies table 1 investing directly in biotech companies such as nestle health science investing in enterome and seres therapeutics and investing in venture capital funds witha microbiome focus such as nestle health science partnering with flagship pioneering as well as danone and novartis in seventurepartners' microbiome-dedicated fund.optimization and transplant durability.

this has led to the recasting of the gut microbiome as a 'new organ' vital to human physiology that varies in composition between individuals over an individual's lifespan and in diseases such as gastrointestinal disorders infections cancer diabetes and obesity.so does the microbiome field provide viable opportunities for biopharma companies to develop innovative therapies or has it been overhyped here we argue that the opportunity is real but that multiple questions remain related to the scienceclinical development regulation and business models for microbiome-based therapies.therapeutic approaches and investment microbiome-based therapeutic approaches and companies are spreading rapidly.

companies including enterome and second genome are focusing on a functional mechanism-of- action angle by directly targeting the pathways.next-generation antibiotics 7 of total investment target drug-resistant microbial strains and provide alternatives that avoid major side effects on the microbiome.in addition to developing small molecules several companies including spero therapeutics and epibiome are focusing on novel technologies such as bacteriophages and targeted peptides.

to account for this trials may require alternative comparators other end points and additional outcomes.second related to manufacturing would new standards be required to ensure good manufacturing practice product quality and safety including reproducibility and scalability of the samples bacteria are living organisms and are subject to changes in function and relative abundance between isolations and under different storage and culture conditions.third related to market access and commercialization will futuremicrobiome-centred interventions primarily be preventive curative or act as a supplement to other therapies will they be providedas a prescription drug or as part of a nutritional supplement how will the deliverytable 1  main partnerships between biotech companies and large companies since 2013cdi clostridium difficile infection ibd inflammatory bowel disease ibs irritable bowel syndrome na not available partnership outside of ibd or cdi.

from 2005 to 2015 an estimated us1.6 billion was invested in microbiome-related companies.

human health care and nutrition represent the main fields of interest for microbiome investors accounting for 75 of the40 companies and 85 of the investments.

companies such as seres therapeutics and vedanta biosciences are focusing on these approaches.

companies including ritter pharmaceuticals and synthetic biologics are actively exploring prebiotic or contrabiotic compounds for gastrointestinal indications.host-microbiome interaction pathways 16 of total investment are being explored based on the analysis of metabolites produced by the microbiome.

a few companies including rebiotix and maat pharma are developing the next generation of fmt therapies.figure 1  overview of more advanced microbiome projects.
