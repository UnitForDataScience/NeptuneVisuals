if digestion in the absence of bc30 for these three proteins is evaluated then digestion for the individual proteins is highest for soy 87.8 of the total nitrogen of the protein intake is present in the summed dialysate fractions then pea 84.6 and finally rice protein 79.4. in the presence of bc30 digestion increase to 99.5 98.5 and 92.6 for these three proteins respectively.digestion of a-amino nitrogen in the absence and presence of bc30similar to tn bc30 also increased the cumulative amount of aan for the three proteins figure 3 with absolute numbers in supplementary table s1.

the increased digestion of the plant proteins by bc30 therefore has the additional benefit of decreasing the amount of proteins that reach the colon and might be fermented by the gut microbiota into potentially toxic metabolites.in summary bc30 increased protein digestibility for all three plant proteins in a validated in vitro model of the upper gi tract.

thus the enhanced protein digestion by bc30 showed a dual benefit enhanced amino acid bioavailability from plant proteins in the upper gi tract and a healthier environment in the colon.keywords protein digestion probiotic bacillus coagulans bc30 in vitro gastrointestinal modelintroductioningestion of plant proteins is increasing enormously nowadays.

for soy and rice however bc30 showed a 2-fold reduction in the tnaan ratio indicating that the liberated digestion products formed during digestion in the presence of bc30 were shorter peptides and more free amino acids than those liberated in the absence of bc30.

data are corrected for total tn recovery which ranged from 94 to 99.7 not shown.resultsdigestion of total nitrogen in the absence and presence of bc30figure 2 shows the cumulative amount of total nitrogen tn for the three protein sources that was 'absorbed by the body' in other words present in the jejunum and ileum dialysate fractions normalised at 100 tofigure 2. average normalised  total nitrogen tn in the jejunum  ileum dialysate fractions normalised to 100 for the experiments without bacillus coagulans bc30 representing the fraction that is taken up by the body.figure 3. average normalised  a-amino nitrogen aan in the jejunum  ileum dialysate fractions normalised to 100 for the experiments without bacillus coagulans bc30 representing the fraction that is taken up by the body.experiments without bc30.

the total volumes of the samples were measured and recorded to allow the calculation of absolute amounts of absorbed digestion products.addition of bacillus coagulans bc30in those experiments where the probiotic culture was added vegetative cells of bc30 were introduced in the jejunum compartment supplementary figure s1 part e. assuming regular intake of bc30 by the host the amount of cells in the small intestine of a human volunteer is expected to remain in steady state some cells will leave the small intestine but those will be renewed by subsequent ingestion.

this cannot be explained by the small addition of extra nitrogen due to the addition of the bc30 culture which was on average only 0.025-0.005 of the protein intake but is the beneficial effect of bc30 on protein digestion.

20.these results indicate that bc30 increases the total amount of nitrogen that is absorbed by the host indicating it aids in digestion of these proteins.

also for protein digestion the model has been validated minekus 1998. correlation analysis showed the following correlation between in vitro y and in vivo x data y  0.9882x r2  0.9728 for 8 proteins ranging in digestibility from 58.0 to 98.9 unpublished data.the genome of bc30 has been determined orru et al.

2014. the bc30 genome contains a number of genes encoding peptidases which could aid in digestion of the three plant proteins.

even when the plant proteins contain these amino acids there is no guarantee for them being released by the natural digestion process andor bc30.

however plant proteins have been known to have lower digestibility than animal- based protein-sources.the healthy pancreas secretes more than 20 zymogens in the duodenum of the gastrointestinal gi tract which are after activation into active digestive enzymes responsible for the digestion of luminal proteins lipids and carbohydrates.

the ratio of tnaan reflects the degree of digestion of the proteins in the samples where a lower ratio indicates a higher degree of digestion due to a higher aan.
