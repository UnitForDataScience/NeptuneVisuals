As shown in  the colonic ALP preparations were strongly inhibited by L-phenylalanine but not L-homoarginine or levamisole.HGM and LGM induced the gene expression of colonic IAP-I but not Akp3 or AlplCompared with the control group colonic IAP-I gene expres- sion was 3.3- and 3.1-fold higher in the HGM and LGM groups respectively P  .05 C. The expression of Akp3 and Alpl genes did not differ among the 3 groups.

Taken together we guess that the fermentable non-digestible carbohydrates similarly elevate colonic ALP activity in rats.Therefore based on the current literature we hypothe-sized that in rats fed an HF diet dietary glucomannan would affect colonic ALP activity and gene expression as well as improve the intestinal immune and barrier functions fer- mentation and microflora.

The other factors of gut epithelial homeostasis did not correlate with colonic ALP.DiscussionWe previously observed that consumption of lily bulb which is rich in glucomannan elevated colonic ALP activity without affecting intestinal liver or serum ALP activity .

colonic ALP activity in rats fed HGM and LGM may beassociated with elevated colonic IAP-I expression.

Additionallily bulb on colonic ALP activity is mainly due to glucomannan and that consumption of glucomannan regardless of its degree of viscosity specifically enhances the colonic ALP activity of rats fed an HF diet.It has not been revealed which type of ALP is elevated in the colon by fermentable carbohydrate containing diet .

Therefore the elevation of colonic ALP activity in the HGM and LGM groups is due to an increase in intestinal type ALP.There is little information whether fermentable carbohy- drate affects colonic gene expression of ALP.

Taken together these studies suggest that elevated colonic ALP activity induced by HGM and LGM has a strong relationship with increased gut IgA mucin secretion and may be related with colonic defense systems.

We anticipated that colonic ALP activity would be important for colonic function in animals and humans and speculate that this glucomannan effect is at least partly related to an improvement in colon health.

Small intestinal ALP has an established protective effect in inflammatory diseases whereas little is known about the function of colonic ALP activity.
