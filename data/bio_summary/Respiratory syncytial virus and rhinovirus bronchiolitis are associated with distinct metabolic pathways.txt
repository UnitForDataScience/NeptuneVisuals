Since the use of PPV was significantly greater in infants with RSV- only infection and may influence the metabolites Table 1 we removed the infants who underwent PPV from the anal- ysis and still found significant differences in the metabolomic profiles between infants with RSV-only infection and those with RV-only infection P  .001.

By contrast metab- olites associated with RV-only infection consisted primarily of N-acetyl metabolites from the amino acid superpathway specif- ically N-acetylthreonine N-acetylleucine N-acetylisokeucine N-acetylphenyalanine N-acetylvaline N-acetylglutamate N-acetyltyrosine and N-acetyllysine Figure 1B.Of the 254 detected metabolites 31 significantly differed between RSV-only and RV-only infections by relative inten- sity with significant differences for 25 metabolites remaining after adjustment for 7 covariates including raceethnicity and PPV use FDR P  .05 Table 2.

Taken together these results suggest that most metabolites that distinguish RSV-only from RV-only infections are host derived.DISCUSSIONIn this novel multi-omic analysis of nasopharyngeal airway samples collected from infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis RSV-only and RV-only infections were associated with signif- icantly different metabolic function.

Higher genomic load of RSV and RV was positively correlated with a higher intensity of the metabolites that distinguished RSV infection from RV infection.

RSV and RV co-occurred with bacterial species eg RSV with S. pneu- moniae and RV with H. influenzae and the associated metag- enomes significantly differed between RSV-only and RV-only infections.

While the relevance of genomic viral load requires additional validation owing to the epidemiological and now pathobiological differences between RSV and RV future clinical trials for infants with bronchiolitis should consider stratifying infants on the basis of viral etiology.Infants with RV-only infection hospitalized with bronchio- litis had altered amino acid metabolism particularly related to N-acetyl metabolism.

Although there were significant metagenomic metabolomic potential differences between infants with RSV- only infection and those with RV-only infection MIMOSA analysis of the 254 metabolites estimated that 19 metabolites 7 were derived from bacteria Supplementary Table 3.
