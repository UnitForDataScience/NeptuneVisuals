The five conditions were as follows 1-year-old S-H1 2-year-old S-H2 and 3-year-old S-H3 healthy P. notoginseng rhizospheric soils 2-year-old root-rot-diseased P. notoginseng notogin- seng rhizospheric soil S-D2 and 3-year-old root-rot- diseased P. notoginseng rhizospheric soil S-D3.

The five root conditions were as follows 1-year-old R-H1 2-year-old R-H2 and 3-year-old R-H3 healthy P. notoginseng roots 2-year-old-root-rot diseased notoginseng roots R- D2 and 3-year-old root-rot-diseased notoginseng roots R- D3.

Bacterial diversity was higher in healthy P. notoginseng rhizospheric soils and roots than in those of diseased P. notoginseng.

It is used to treat cardiovascular diseases inflammation various body pains trauma and internal and external bleeding due to injury In addition P. notoginseng roots are utilized as raw materials in more than 400 Chinese medicinal products and 1300 companies including nearly all Chinese pharma- ceutical companies Obstacles to continuous cropping have become a major constraint for the cultivation of P. notoginseng.

The planting fallow or rotation period is generally longer than 6 years that is after harvest a P. notoginseng plant cannot be planted again within 6 years The primary obstacle to the continuous cropping of P. notoginseng is root-rot disease which is highly destructive and result in yield reduction and low content of the active ingredients According to a recent survey root-rot diseases are always accompanied by bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas sp.

Among these bacteria thehighly abundant Pseudomonas which was also isolated from healthy P. notoginseng and exhibited the strongest pathoge- nicity was more abundant in diseased than in healthy plants Therefore further attention should be paid to this genus.The genus of Panax plants specifically P. ginseng P. notoginseng and P. quinquefolius are primarily reared in artificial shade for several years.

Panax notoginseng is negatively affected by continuous cropping and becomes vulnerable to attack by microbial pathogens.

In the present study culture-independent Illumina MiSeq was used to investigate root-endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria in response to continuous cropping of P. notoginseng.
