The small cohorts were underpowered to link the microbiome to disease severity the microbiome changed over time both with disease severity and with treatment making it difficult to associate microbial changes with disease and most impor- tantly many of the biomarker findings could not be replicated in other cohorts.Moreover many of the new-onset studies that existed at the time examined only the fecal microbiome.

Our 2014 study published in Cell Host  Microbe ''The Treatment-Naive Microbiome in New- Onset Crohn's Disease'' was a subset of this larger study designed to improve our understanding of how the microbiome contributes to the inflammatory cascade of CD pathogenesis  .At the onset of the study we knew that inflammatory bowel disease IBD is a complex disorder involving both genetic and environmental components and large-scale genome-wide associationstudies had linked IBD to host-microbe pathways.

The scientific community is already starting to pursue a series of interventions that target the microbiome in CD patients.

We envision the MD-index to one day become part of the CD diagnostic arma- mentarium to stratify patients based on predicted treatment response.Antibiotics Are Not The SolutionAt the time of the publication of our study overwhelming evidence already existed that antibiotics are detrimental to a healthy microbiome and it was our hypothesis that the use of antibiotics impacts the overall community structure and increases the potential for dysbiosis.

Moreover both the virome  and fungome   are also beginning to be unraveled in IBD which will ultimately contribute to a more compre- hensive understanding of microbe-host interactions in these diseases.Although we did not arrive at a single silver-bullet microbe that can point to a cure for CD our work identified a clear list of potential culprits that may be involved in the initiation andor progres- sion of CD.

This is an exciting observa- tion in the context of switching from harm- ful to beneficial networks and may change the way we think about using animal models to study CD.A Powerful Diagnostic ToolOur team aimed to quantitatively link the microbial imbalance to disease using the microbial dysbiosis index MD-index which is calculated as the log of total abundance in organisms increased in CD over total abundance of organisms decreased in CD.

The loss of protective microbes results in the proliferation of less beneficial taxa thereby exacerbating the inflammation.Genetic studies suggest that many of the genes associated with CD are respon- sible for immune system recognition of microbes suggesting that these patients are unable to either nurture beneficial bacteria or manage the harmful ones .If antibiotics are not only ineffective but exacerbate the disease then alterna- tive solutions are needed for treatment intervention.ConclusionIt was the integration of multiple disci- plines across multiple institutions that enabled us to provide a foundation for the study of CD.

Previous studies had exam- ined the role of the microbiome in patients with established disease but these studies had important limitations.

To date this study remains the largest sin- gle-cohort microbiome study related to new-onset IBD n  447 and represents the largest characterization of mucosal- associated microbiota in non-IBD sub- jects n  221.
