To exploit the microbial contribution toathlete performance prospective studies are required to bridge the gap betweencorrelation and causation and the interactions among biological co-variables and themicrobiota.4 Athletes of the future will continue to measure many parameters offitness and amongst these will be microbial indicators of health and nutritionalwelfare.Conflicts of interestFS is a founder shareholder in Atlantia Food Clinical Trials Tucana Health Ltd andAlimentary Health Ltd.FundingOC is funded by the Irish Centre for Arthritis Research and Education ICARE.

Patients with non-communicablediseases such as metabolic syndrome obesity and inflammatory bowel diseasedemonstrate distinct microbial alterations.

This has prompted vigorous pursuit of themechanisms by which this microbial organ influences host health.

This branch ofmedicine has already revealed exciting avenues for disease treatment from thediscovery of novel antibiotics to the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficileinfection.1The scale and spectrum of microbial influence is substantial and elegantstudies have linked the presence or absence of specific microbes with immunity2neuro-development and even behavioral disturbances.3 The potential impact ofmicrobiome science extends to the specialties of Sports Medicine and particularly toExercise Medicine.43EXERCISING YOUR MICROBIOTAThe development of a mature enteric microbiota is subject to modifiable and non-modifiable factors including diet and host genetics.4 The gut microbiota is perturbedby antibiotic usage and is influenced by short- and long-term dietary trends.

Recentlythe interaction between exercise and the gut microbiota has been highlightedfollowing identification of correlations between cardio-respiratory fitness and health-associated gut microbial parameters such as taxonomic diversity and richness.5 6 It isunknown whether improvements in cardio-respiratory fitness achieved duringadulthood can shift the gut microbiota toward a more healthy compositional profile.Evidence suggests that physical activity in childhood and adolescence supports thedevelopment of a diverse core microbiota that promotes psychological and metabolichealth.7 However longitudinal studies are required to establish or challenge thishypothesis.In determining the true or specific effect of exercise on the composition andactivity of the gut microbiota significant impediments must be addressed.

Simply stated athletes need toknow that when they eat and drink they are feeding not only themselves but alsotheir microbes Dietary supplementation although commonplace is generallyadopted with poor understanding of how supplements influence gut microbial healthand performance.

Athletes' microbial potentialmay also be shaped by their own genotype.8 However longitudinal studies are neededto resolve many gaps in knowledge as most of the available data on exercise and themicrobiota are cross-sectional.In summary there is significant potential for microbiota research to contributeto the specialty of Sports and Exercise Medicine.

In addition Sports and ExerciseMedicine represents a model or platform to facilitate studies of the interplay betweenhuman physiology host and microbial genetics and diet.
