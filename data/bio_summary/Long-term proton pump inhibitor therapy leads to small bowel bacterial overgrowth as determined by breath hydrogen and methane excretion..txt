An important advance of this work was very precise characterization of the study and comparison group and14C-D-xylose breath testPereira et al 1998 UK2476self-controlAspirate culturea lactulose HBTAspirate cultureH210 ppm--Yes62.50PPIT--proton pump inhibitors treated patients.SBBO--small bowel bacterial overgrowth.H2--hydrogen.

Subdivision of all patients into four categories according to results of the glucose HMBT.were measured immediately after sample collection using a gas chromatography Quintron Microlyzer0.005-2-3 ppm or 5 of full scale for Hand CH  and theBreath test parameters and identification of SBBOHMBT--hydrogenmethane breath test.

We found that PPIT had all H2 test parameters baseline H2 levels maximum peak of H2 as well as mean H2 through the whole test significantly higher than C. Even those PPIT who did not meet the criteria of breath test positivity had statistically higher breath H2 levels compared to C. Although we did not observe significant differences in CH4 excretion between groups 19.4 of PPIT and 12.9 of C would have had a false-negative HMBT results had CH4 not been taken into account.

The 1st Rome H2--Breath Testing Consensus Conference Working Group recommended the glu- cose H2 breath test as the best tool for the diagnosis of SBBO owing to its high diagnostic accuracy simpli- city low cost and non-invasiveness .
