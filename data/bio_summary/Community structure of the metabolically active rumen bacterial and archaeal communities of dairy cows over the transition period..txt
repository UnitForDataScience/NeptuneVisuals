The 16S rRNA transcript profile of all archaeal taxa showed significant changes over the transition period the Methanobacteriales order and the Methanosphaera genus increased significantly in relative abundance from 80 to 90 and 8 to 18 whereas the Methanobrevibacter genus from 69.8 to 61.8 and the Methanomassiliicoc cales Alpha diversity analysis of the rumen active methanogen and bacterial communities.1Weekly based samples groups are indicated and sample numbers for each time period were W-310 W-29 W-110 W110 W29 W39 W413.2 Alpha diversity Chao1 Observed species and PD whole tree analysis was performed for the active methanogen community profiled by Illumina amplicon sequencing of mcrA transcripts and the active bacterial community profiled by Illumina amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA transcripts.3P-value smaller than 0.05 indicates the significant effect of fixed factor 'Weeks relative to parturition'.a-cLeast square means t-test within a row with different superscripts differ significantly P  0.05 Mean standard error is indicated.Principal coordinate analysis PCoA of the active rumen bacterial community.

The RNA amplicon sequencing of prokaryotic 16S rRNA and mcrA revealed similar archaeal community structure as the DNA based amplicon sequencing man- uscript in preparation a finding that was further supported by the T-RFLP profiles generated from mcrA gene sequences DNA and mcrA transcripts RNA indicating accordance between presence and activity of the archaeal community members.Phylogenetic analysis of mcrA sequences revealed three clades of the order Methanobacter- iales Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii clade Methanobrevibacter ruminantium clade and Methanosphaera contributing more than 95 to the rumen active methanogen communities.

The entire bacterial community showed significant shifts over the transition period as evaluated by weighted UniFrac distance matrix based ANOSIM testR  0.29 P-value  0.001.Archaeal 16S rRNA transcript amplicon profileWith the universal prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene primer targeting both the bacterial and archaeal communities nearly 3 of the total sequences were assigned to the Euryarchaeota phylum of the Archaea domain .

Across the transition period predominant genera of the metabolically active rumen bacterial community consisted of unclassified Ruminococcaceae 22.3 and Lachnospiraceae 7 Ruminococcus 6.9 Prevotella 6.6 and Ruminobacter 3.2.The active bacterial community in the rumen consisted of twenty phyla of which Firmicutes 46.91 Bacteroidetes 19.97 Proteobacteria 15.97 Spirochaetes 1.58 and Fibrobac- teres 1.52 were the most abundant five phyla with a median relative abundance value shown in brackets .

A comparison between DNA 16S rRNAgene and RNA 16S rRNA clone libraries revealed distinct phylotypes of a marine bacterial community for the two approaches thus indicating that the most abundant members of a community may not necessarily be the most active or vice versa.

Community structure of the active methanogen community as revealed by Illumina amplicon sequencing of mcrA and bacterial 16S rRNA transcripts.1 Weekly based samples groups are indicated and relative abundance  of individual methanogen group at the order and genus levels are displayed.

Despite changes in the classi- fied groups a significant increase in relative abundance was observed for the unclassified Gam- maproteobacteria 1.39-27.32 and a significant decrease from 1.26 to 0.68 over the transition period was observed for the unclassified Proteobacteria.The least abundant bacteria phyla Fibrobacteres and Spirochaetes including lower taxo- nomic groups within these phyla showed no significant changes over the transition period.Diversity analysis of the active bacterial communityThe species richness Chao1 of the bacterial community decreased significantly over the tran- sition period with the highest value 3708.15 in the three weeks before parturition W-3 and the lowest value 3045.70 in the third week after parturition W3 .

Those bacterial phyla with relative abundance lower than 1 were not shown.2Sample numbers for each time period were W-310W-29W-110W110W29W39W413.3Different taxonomic levels were indicated by the first letter of each K Kingdom PPhylum CClass OOrder FFamily GGenus.4P-value smaller than 0.05 indicates the significant effect of fixed factor 'weeks relative to parturition'.a-cLeast squares means within a row with different superscripts differ significantly P  0.05 Mean standard error is presentedLachnospiraceae significantly increased from the lowest relative abundance of 5.69 in the pre- partum period to the highest relative abundance of 8.23 in the postpartum period.The Bacteroidetes phylum represented by the Bacteroidia class and the Bacteroidales order showed no significant changes over the transition period nevertheless two large families of this phylum Prevotellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae showed different patterns where the for- mer increased significantly from 6 to 12 and the latter decreased significantly from 7 to 3 over the transition period.

Total RNA was extracted from the rumen samples and cDNA thereof was subsequently used for characterizing the metabolically active bacte- rial 16S rRNA transcript amplicon sequencing and archaeal qPCR T-RFLP and mcrA and 16S rRNA transcript amplicon sequencing communities.

the bacterial families Desulfovibrio- naceae Elusimicrobiaceae and Sphaerochaetaceae were detected only with total RNA and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing but not with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.The rumen archaeal community has received special attention in particular with respect to the methanogens being a major source of anthropogenic methane emissions.
