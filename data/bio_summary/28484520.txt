The study sample consisted of 45 people with CoeD reporting mild to moderate gastro- intestinal symptoms and an external control group who had undertaken the same faecal testing used in this study at the same laboratory and within the same time period who also reported gastrointestinal symptoms from other causes but were negative for CoeD.EthicsThe study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Southern Cross University ethics approval number ECN-12-021.

Parasite detection data were analysed by con- ducting exact Chi square tests on the two-way con- tingency Tables CoeDnon-CoeD and detectednot detected.All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript.ResultsDemographicsA total of 37 females and eight males mean age47.3 years residing in New South Wales Australia were allocated to the CoeD arm of this study.

This study indicates that gastrointestinal dysbiosis is prevalent in this popula- tion and faecal assessment may provide important clinical information in this sub-group of CoeD patients.Study limitationsThe addition of ASCAs as a biomarker would have strengthened the design of this study and provided greater insight as to the potential clinical relevance of the molecular detection of saccharomyces in faecal samples of indications with CoeD.

This study may have been strengthened through having the faecal specimens analysed by two laboratories to verify the findings.Given the limitations of this study we cannot conclude there is a relationship of cause and effect but instead seek to report an important observation.

The study coordinator JH was granted access to patient test result records but not clinical progress notes.

The specimens were collected from the participant by a biological courier and delivered to the study site.

The role of candida in trig- gering aberrant immune response to dietary proteins has been supported by an animal study that demonstrated that gastrointestinal Candida colonisation promotes sensitisation against food antigens partly due to mast cell mediated hyperpermeability in the gastrointestinal mucosa .

act as an immunosuppressant through an ability to reduce sIgAthus allowing colonisation of the intestine and triggering autoimmune responses such as CoeD in the genetically predisposed The findings from this study and those from the studies discussed above warrants further research that explores the role of Candida sp.

The study concept and design drafting of the manuscript and critical revision of the manuscript for important intel- lectual content were conducted by JH and SM.
