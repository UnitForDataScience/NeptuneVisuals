This indicates that spore germination during storage which could have contributed to the observed changes in spore germination efficiency did not occur.Spore germination efficiency of C. difficile in beef jerkyThe spore germination efficiency of C. difficile strains DK1 and M120 in beef jerky at aw 0.82 and 0.72 during storage at room temperature for up to 12 weeks did not change significantly .

Removal of such layer of C. difficile spores has been reported to increase the germination efficiency of the spores of some C. difficile strains ae.Water activity aw reduction is an alternative to the high energy-cost storage of foods at low temperature.

All experiments were conducted in triplicates from a single batch spore harvest and paired t-test a 0.05 was performed to compare the RH values between fresh and stored spores using Microsoft Excel 2013.RH 1 OD440 final 1OD440 initialResults and discussionInitial C. difficile spore germination efficiencyIn this study germination efficiency was evaluated by the ability of C. difficile spores to germinate and form colonies.

Although the maturation of bacterial spores is well described in B. subtilis species  it has not been fully studied in spores of C. difficile strains.ConclusionsThe germination efficiency was reduced significantly when C. difficile strains M120 and DK1 spores were stored at room tem- perature in PBS and beef jerky with reduced aw.

Collectively these results indicate that depending on the germination properties of C. difficile spores and the media properties their germination efficiency may increase or decrease during long term food storage.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Further studies are necessary to determine the molecular mechanisms of survival and germination efficiency increase of spores from C. difficile strains such as R20291 to reduce the risk of C. difficile transmission via foods.AcknowledgmentsThis project was supported by Formula Grants no.

To investigate the germination efficiency of C. difficile spores in a commercial reduced aw meat product two samples of beef jerky with aw 0.82 Tender Bite Link Snacks Inc. Minong WI and 0.72 Monogram Food Solutions LLC Memphis TN as determined experimentally AquaLab PRE WaterActivity Meter were purchased locally.

Mechanisms explaining the difference among strains in germina- tion efficiency and superdormancy are not yet known.Spore germination efficiency during storage of C. difficile in PBS at reduced awIn the case of spores of strains M120 and DK1 aw had no sig- nificant effect on germination efficiency during the tested period.
