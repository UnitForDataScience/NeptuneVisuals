this indicates that spore germination during storage which could have contributed to the observed changes in spore germination efficiency did not occur.spore germination efficiency of c. difficile in beef jerkythe spore germination efficiency of c. difficile strains dk1 and m120 in beef jerky at aw 0.82 and 0.72 during storage at room temperature for up to 12 weeks did not change significantly .

collectively these results indicate that depending on the germination properties of c. difficile spores and the media properties their germination efficiency may increase or decrease during long term food storage.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionhealth care-associated hca and community-associated ca cases of clostridium difficile infections cdi have steadily increased over the past decades  .

removal of such layer of c. difficile spores has been reported to increase the germination efficiency of the spores of some c. difficile strains ae.water activity aw reduction is an alternative to the high energy-cost storage of foods at low temperature.

although the maturation of bacterial spores is well described in b. subtilis species  it has not been fully studied in spores of c. difficile strains.conclusionsthe germination efficiency was reduced significantly when c. difficile strains m120 and dk1 spores were stored at room tem- perature in pbs and beef jerky with reduced aw.

further studies are necessary to determine the molecular mechanisms of survival and germination efficiency increase of spores from c. difficile strains such as r20291 to reduce the risk of c. difficile transmission via foods.acknowledgmentsthis project was supported by formula grants no.

however the molecular mechanisms of this ef- fect are not known.spore surface hydrophobicity of c. difficile spore during storage at reduced awspores of c. difficile strain r20291 showed a significantly higher surface hydrophobicity than m120 and dk1 strains .

the germination efficiency of c. difficile strain r20291 spores has been shown to increase after 4 months at room temperature and this may reflect a loss of superdormancy .several studies suggest that spore surface hydrophobicity plays a significant role in cdi transmission and persistence  .

a germination effi- ciency increase of c. difficile spores has been associated with the loss of the exosporium e .

therefore the aim of this work was to determine the aw effect on the spore germination efficiency of c. difficile strains r20291 m120 and dk1 which are isolates from cdi cases animals and meat products respectively.
