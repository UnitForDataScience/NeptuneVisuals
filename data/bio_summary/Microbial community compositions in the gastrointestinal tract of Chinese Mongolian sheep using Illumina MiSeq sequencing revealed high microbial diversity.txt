The samples were then stored at -80 degC until further analysis.

The final elution volume was 200 mL and DNA concentration was con- ducted on a Nano Drop spectrophotometer Nano DropTechnologies Wilmington DE USA.

The reverse primer was barcoded with a unique 6 bp error-correcting to each sample.

The following thermal cycling conditions were used 3 min of initial denaturation at 94 degC 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 degC for 45 s annealing at 50 degC for 60 s and elongation at 72 degC for 90 s and a last step at 72 degC for 10 min.

The amplified products were evalu- ated by electrophoresis in 2 agarose gel and purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Qiagen Dus- seldorf Germany.
