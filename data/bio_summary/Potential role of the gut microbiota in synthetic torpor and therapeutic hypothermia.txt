Moreover in cases of gut injuries it is important to have a clear understanding of the gut role during hibernation.Importance of the gut in hibernation physiologyDuring hibernation the intestine especially the proximal tract undergoes a severe atrophy without changing the overall structure36.

Population-level analysis of gut microbiome variation.

The emerging role of the gut microbiota in the hibernation process suggests the importance of maintaining a mutualistic gut microbiota configuration in the application of therapeutic hypothermia as well as in the development of new strategy such as the use of synthetic torpor in humans.

Thus low levels of SCFAs during torpor may be central for the atrophy recorded in the small intestine mucosa37.The gut immune system shows alterations during hibernation indeed gut epithelium becomes leakier during the long torpor phase leading to the uncon- trolled passage of many molecules and even of bacte- ria39.

This perspective paved the way to the study of hibernation physiology in natural hibernators highlighting an unexpected importance of the gut microbial ecosystem in hibernation and torpor.

This allows the gut microbiome to provide the host with metabolites which are essential to keep the host immunological and meta- bolic homeostasis during hibernation.
