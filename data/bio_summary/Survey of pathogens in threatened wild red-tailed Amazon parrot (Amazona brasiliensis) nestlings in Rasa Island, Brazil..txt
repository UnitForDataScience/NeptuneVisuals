Antibodies to AIV NDV and C. psittaci has not been found in blue-fronted Amazon par- rots A. aestiva in Bolivia.Serologic testing in wild parakeets Aratinga weddellii and Brotogeris sanctithomae in Peru were neg- ative to antibodies for C. psittaci and NDVand four species of wild Mexican parrots showed negative serologic tests for AIV and NDV.The results of this study indicate that the red-tailed Ama- zon population located in Rasa Island is not infected by C. psittaci AIV WNV or NDV and the data obtained is supported by previous studies involving wild psittacine species.

Colonies were not isolated from four cloacal samples of parrots in PVC nests and from two oropharyngeal samples and one cloacal sample of parrots in artificial wooden nests.The prevalence of bacterial species obtained from cloacal and oropharyngeal samples according to the nest can be observed in There was no influence of the type of artifi- cial nest in the birds' microbiota P  0.05.

All data were verified for normal distribution by the Shapiro-Wilk test.were sampled in three artificial wooden and one PVC nest two birds were sampled in the same nest in five artificial wooden and three PVC nests in all other nests just one nestling was sampled per nest.Cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from 58 nestlings for C. psittaci detection and from 50 nestlings for AIV NDV and WNV detection.One hundred eighteen bacterial colonies were isolated from 73 samples of 40 nestlings totaling 91.25 7380 of pos- itive samples for enterobacteria.

All samples were kept frozen at -40 C until analysis in the laboratory.Microbiological analysesSamples were plated on brain heart infusion and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. Subsequently they were stored in 30 glycerol solution at -20 C. When thawed the samples were inocu- lated by streaking method on blood and MacConkey's agar media and incubated at 37 C for 24 h for the bacteria grow.

Cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs samples were collected from 23 birds from artificial wooden nests 15 birds from PVC nests and 2 birds from natural nests for microbiological analysis.

Much of the population of parrots is found in protected areas in Parana but the lack of supervision in the region enables the cutting of important treespecies for reproduction shelter and feeding of the parrot.Besides this these birds probably have less anthropogenic interference less contact with human beings and domestic animals and suffer less stress by environmental disorders when compared to birds from other areas such as Pantanal where modifications in the habitat are largely due to theThe presence of WNV AIV and NDV in parrots has not been detected in Brazil and is also consistent with the results of the present study.

The 74 birds had estimated age between 25 and 56 days averaging 42 days and weighed between 275 and 540 g averaging 420 g.Cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from 40 nestlings for microbiological analysis 23 individuals from 12 artificial wooden nests 15 parrots from 10 PVC nests and two parrots from two natural nests.

The influence of age adult and young and environment captive and wild could explain the difference in the diversity of bacterial community between the wild nestlings sampled in the present study and others researches.In Brazil the detection of gram-negative bacteria has been reported in asymptomatic wild A. brasiliensis nestlings in Parana and Sao Paulo coast.

Fund- ing for this project was in part provided by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP 201113821-7 201305485-2 and 200905994-9.r e f e r e n c e sand has been reported in captive parrots on outbreaks and wild prevalence studies.In the state of Parana C. psittaci'sDNA was detected in 1.2 of the samples from 117 free-livingA.

Pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance tests could be used to assess the real risks of these bacteria to the red-tailed Ama- zon parrots' health in future evaluations.Concerning the nests the excretions of the birds can accu- mulate over time increasing exposure levels of nestlings to fecal bacteria.
