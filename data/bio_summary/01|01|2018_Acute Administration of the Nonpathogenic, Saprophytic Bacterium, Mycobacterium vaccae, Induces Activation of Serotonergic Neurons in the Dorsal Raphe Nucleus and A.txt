for analysis of the effects of acute challenge with m. vaccae relative to vehicle-challenged controls on tb and lma we analyzed a baseline time period from 2 h prior tochallenge until challenge with m. vaccae or vehicle time 0 and a post-challenge time period from time 0 until 11 h after challenge whereby each individual's scores were averagedfor successive 30-min interval blocks at the start time of each averaged 30-min interval.in experiment 2 cages containing individually housed mice were moved to receivers for telemetric recordings atspecific time points on the day of the m. vaccae or vehicle challenge only during three 30-min periods 1 a baseline period from -30 min to 0 min immediately before acutechallenge with m. vaccae or vehicle 2 from 2 h to 2 h 30 min following challenge and 3 from 10 h to 10 h30 min following challenge.

to test this hypothesis in experiment 1 adult male balbc mice were implanted with telemetric recording devices and then immunized withmycobacterium vaccae nctc 11659 0.1 mg s.c. days- 28 - 14 n  36. on day 1 mice received an acute chal- lenge with m. vaccae 0.1 mg s.c. or borate-buffered saline vehicle.

together these data are consistent with the hypothesis that acute periph-eral immune activation with a heat-killed preparation of m. vaccae transiently induces mild hypothermia in association with suppression of locomotor activity activates subsets ofserotonergic neurons in the dr and induces antidepressant- like behavioral responses.keywords actinobacteria  antidepressant  body temperature  hypothermia  m. vaccae  mycobacterium vaccaeabbreviationsbbsborate-buffered salinedrdorsal raphe nucleusdrcdorsal raphe nucleus caudal partdridorsal raphe nucleus interfascicular partdrvlvlpag dorsal raphe nucleus ventrolateral partventrolateral periaqueductal grayfstforced swim testlmalocomotor activitylpslipopolysaccharidepbphosphate bufferpbsphosphate-buffered salinertroom temperaturetbcore body temperaturetphtryptophan hydroxylaseintroductionchronic low-grade inflammation is emerging as a core feature of anxiety and affective disorders rohleder  miller and raison .
