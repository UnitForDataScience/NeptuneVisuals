Total genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp Cador pathogen lysis minikit Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol.Luminal bacterial DNA extractionMedia samples were centrifuged at 6000xg to pellet bacteria and resuspended in 500mL buffer ATL Qia- gen. Pellets were subjected to mechanical lysis atmaximum speed for 10 minutes in Pathogen lysis tubes Qiagen before DNA extraction using QIAamp UCP Pathogen Mini Kit Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol.Denaturation gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE profilingA highly conserved 200bp sequence neighboring the V3 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal 16S rRNA primers 341FGC and 518R Table S1.Gels were post- stained using SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain and visualized using Image Lab software with 4 sec- onds exposure.

Data was normalized to total bacteria using universal pri- mers and the relative abundances of each phylum determined using the delta delta Ct 2DDCt algo- rithm method.Determination of total bacterial loadTotal bacterial load in the functional and defunctioned intestine was measured via qPCR using universal eubacterial 16S rRNA primers Uni334F and Uni514R Table S1 and Sybr Green ReadyMix Sigma- Aldrich.

DGGE profiles were proc- essed digitally using BioNumerics software version 7.5 Applied Maths following the manufacturer's guidelines.DGGE band excision and sequencing analysisAmplicons from DGGE bands of interest were reamplified directly from the gel via inoculation using a sterile pipette tip.

Consen- sus sequences were generated using BioEdit software available at  and sequences were then classified using nucle- otide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLASTn available online at .

Participant demographics and post-surgical clinical data are presented in .Sample acquisition and handlingLoop ileostomy reversal surgery involves reanasto- mosis of functional and defunctioned ileum using aTable 1.

Villous height was measured using ImageJ software.Coded H  E sections were scored for inflammation by a blinded observer.

Scoring applied a well-validated system which assigns a score of 0 - 4 for inflammation and mucosal damage based on degree and extent of transmural inflammation goblet cell depletion immune infiltrate and architec- ture distortion.Immunofluorescence PCNA analysisParaffin sections were dewaxed rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling in Sodium Citrate Buffer 10mM Sodium Citrate 0.05 Tween 20 pH 6.0 using a microwave oven for15 minutes.

Slides were counterstained withHoescht33342 trihydrochloride nucleic acid stain Life Technologies and mounted using VectaShield mounting medium Vector Laboratories.

Number of PCNA-positive IEC per crypt was counted by a blinded observer and the percent of proliferative cellsall nucleated cells was calculated.TUNEL assayTUNEL assay was performed on tissue sections using Click-iT Plus TUNEL Alexa Flour 594 kit according to manufacturer's protocol Thermo- Fisher Scientific.

Tissue sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling in Sodium Citrate Buffer 10mM Sodium Citrate 0.05 Tween 20 pH 6.0 using a microwave oven for 15 minutes.
