Total genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp Cador pathogen lysis minikit Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol.Luminal bacterial DNA extractionMedia samples were centrifuged at 6000xg to pellet bacteria and resuspended in 500mL buffer ATL Qia- gen. Pellets were subjected to mechanical lysis atmaximum speed for 10 minutes in Pathogen lysis tubes Qiagen before DNA extraction using QIAamp UCP Pathogen Mini Kit Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol.Denaturation gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE profilingA highly conserved 200bp sequence neighboring the V3 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal 16S rRNA primers 341FGC and 518R Table S1.Gels were post- stained using SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain and visualized using Image Lab software with 4 sec- onds exposure.

Data was normalized to total bacteria using universal pri- mers and the relative abundances of each phylum determined using the delta delta Ct 2DDCt algo- rithm method.Determination of total bacterial loadTotal bacterial load in the functional and defunctioned intestine was measured via qPCR using universal eubacterial 16S rRNA primers Uni334F and Uni514R Table S1 and Sybr Green ReadyMix Sigma- Aldrich.

A standard curve constructed for bacterial enumeration using pCR2.1 Topo-TA plasmid vector containing a cloned portion of the 16S rRNA gene.

Bacterial enumeration of A average- and B absolute-16S rRNA gene copy numbers per gram of mucosal tissue in functional and defunctioned intestine n D 27 p D 0.0003.Loss of microbial diversity and convergence toward a similar bacterial profile occurs in defunctioned intestineConsidering the decrease total bacterial load in defunctioned intestine microbial composition was investigated using DGGE.

DGGE profiles were proc- essed digitally using BioNumerics software version 7.5 Applied Maths following the manufacturer's guidelines.DGGE band excision and sequencing analysisAmplicons from DGGE bands of interest were reamplified directly from the gel via inoculation using a sterile pipette tip.

Consen- sus sequences were generated using BioEdit software available at  and sequences were then classified using nucle- otide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLASTn available online at .

A defunctioned loop ileostomy is usually reversed within 12 months rein- stating luminal flow through the entire intestine.
