as expected no changes in plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations were shown in the rg group after the intervention phase which confirmed participant adherence.stool weight frequency ph water content and scfaswe observed an increase in bowel-movement frequency p  0.03 and stool weight p  8.39 3 1028 in the wg group table 3 with no change in the rg group which resulted in between-group dif- ferences in bowel-movement frequency p  0.02 and stool weight p  1.77 3 1027. changes in stool acetate dwg compared with drg mean 6 sem 2.13 6 1.36 mmoll p  0.02 and total scfa 2.70 6 2.25 mmoll p  0.05 were larger in the wg group than in the rg group mainly because of a decline in the rg group table 4. there was also a weak correlation between acetate and 190 r  0.19 p  0.02 and total alkylresorcinol r  0.19 p  0.02 which suggested that the difference in changes between the 2 groups was a reflection of the difference in wg intake.fecal microbiota compositionsamples were sequenced in 2 batches number of samples per sequencing run w100 to generate a good depth number of sequences per sample of sequencing per sample.

a positive association was shown between lachnospira and acetate fdr-corrected p  0.002 or butyrate fdr-corrected p  0.005. we also showed that there was a higher percentage of terminal effector memory t cells p  0.03 and lps-stimulated ex vivo production of tumor necrosis factor-a p  0.04 in the wg group than in the rg group which were positively associated with plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations.

a permutation-based anova adonis function in the vegan package in r software 60 99 permutations with weighted unifrac-distance metrics revealed that the variation in the gut microbiota community structure could not be explained by the intervention group either at baseline p  0.39 or after the intervention p  0.25. however a similar analysis with the use of unweighted unifrac metrics showed differences in the microbiota structure of wg and rg groups at p  0.05 and p  0.07 for baseline and after the intervention respectively.

a total of 103 qualified volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned and 81 of these individuals completed the study with 40 subjects 25 men and 15 women in the rg group and 41 subjects 24 men and 17 women in the wg group figure 2. of 22 participants who dropped out 13 individuals dropped out during the run-in phase and 9 individuals dropped out after random assignment n  5 from the rg group and n  4 from the wg group because of personal reasons that were unrelated to the intervention including the need to take anti- biotics time constraints family events no shows and a di- verticulitis diagnosis by the primary care physician.

compared with the rg group intakes of iron magnesium zinc and selenium were higher in the wg group however intakes of vitamin d thiamin niacin and folate were lower.the consumption of wgs as expected resulted in an increasein total dietary fiber intake in the wg group than in the rg group.

increased wg consumption was accompanied by increases in total alkylresorcinols and individual alkylresorcinols 190 210 and 230 all p  0.0001 in the wg group table 2. plasma al- kylresorcinol concentrations of 190 210 and 230 and total alkylresorcinols in the wg group after the intervention were 6- 9- 5- and 7-fold higher all p  0.0001 respectively than the concentrations at baseline.

there were no between-group differences in the is however there was a moderate inverse correlation between the is and total alkylresorcinol in the wg group pearson's r  20.40 p  0.02.there was a difference in the change from baseline to follow-up between the 2 groups in lps-stimulated tnf-a production dwg compared with drg mean 6 sem 2131 6 1399 pgml p  0.04 table 10 which was mainly due to a decrease in the rg group.

the medication exclusion criteria included the use of antibiotics within the past 3 mo the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or antihistamines or the inability to discontinue the use of these substances for 72 h before the first-day blood draw until 48 h after receipt of a delayed-type hypersensitivity dth skin-test implant and the use of immunosuppressive drugs.

p values were corrected for the total number of comparisons with the use of a false-discovery rate fdr correction whereby significance was determined according to fdr-adjusted p values 0.25. we chose the fdr of 0.25 for these analyses because of the large number of tests.a-diversity values for each sample were described with the use of the whole-tree phylogenetic diversity variable.

however we observed an increase in the number of positive antigens and total diameter of induration in response to tri- chophyton in both groups table 8 which might have been a reflection of the repeated administration of the antigen.white blood cell count differential lymphocyte phenotype and lymphocyte proliferationno between-group differences occurred in total numbers of white blood cells lymphocytes monocytes eosinophils ba- sophils or neutrophils supplemental table 4. wg intake did not influence the percentages of t lymphocytes cd4 t cells and subpopulations cd8 t cells and subpopulations b cells nk cells nk t cells or regulatory t cells table 9. there was a difference in the change of the percentage of total ter- minal effector memory t cells dwg compared with drg mean 6 sem 2.68 6 2.33 p  0.03. a partial correlation analysis showed a modest positive correlation between termi- nal effector memory cells and 190 r  0.22 p  0.04 210 r  0.33 p  0.001 and total alkylresorcinols r  0.28 p  0.01 thereby suggesting that the increase in terminal effector memory t cells was associated with an increase in wg intake.there was no within- or between-group difference in t cellproliferation in response to the mitogens con a phytohemag- glutinin or anti-cd3 and anti-cd28 at any of the concentrations used supplemental table 5.plasma cytokines and lbp ex vivo production of cytokines and nk cell activitywg intake had no effect on plasma concentrations of cytokines or lbp supplemental table 6. although several inflammatory markers are used to define chronic inflammation it is increasingly appreciated that the measurement of an integrated index such as an is that takes into account multiple cytokines may be a better representation of systemic inflammation status.

a-diversity values were verified to be normally distributed with the use of the shapiro-wilks test and within- and between-group analyses were carried out with the use of a paired t test.weighted and unweighted unifrac measures of between-sample ecologic variation b diversity were used to test the hypothesis that participants were more similar to other subjects within the same treatment group.
