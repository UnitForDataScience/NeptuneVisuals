As expected no changes in plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations were shown in the RG group after the intervention phase which confirmed participant adherence.Stool weight frequency pH water content and SCFAsWe observed an increase in bowel-movement frequency P  0.03 and stool weight P  8.39 3 1028 in the WG group Table 3 with no change in the RG group which resulted in between-group dif- ferences in bowel-movement frequency P  0.02 and stool weight P  1.77 3 1027.

Results Compared with the RG group the WG group had increased plasma total alkyresorcinols a measure of WG intake P  0.0001 stool weight P  0.0001 stool frequency P  0.02 and short- chain fatty acid SCFA producer Lachnospira false-discovery rate FDR-corrected P  0.25 but decreased pro-inflammatory Entero- bacteriaceae FDR-corrected P  0.25.

Changes in stool acetate DWG compared with DRG mean 6 SEM 2.13 6 1.36 mmolL P  0.02 and total SCFA 2.70 6 2.25 mmolL P  0.05 were larger in the WG group than in the RG group mainly because of a decline in the RG group Table 4.

Compared with the RG group intakes of iron magnesium zinc and selenium were higher in the WG group however intakes of vitamin D thiamin niacin and folate were lower.The consumption of WGs as expected resulted in an increasein total dietary fiber intake in the WG group than in the RG group.

Changes in stool acetate P  0.02 and total SCFAs P  0.05 were higher in the WG group than in the RG group.

We also showed that there was a higher percentage of terminal effector memory T cells P  0.03 and LPS-stimulated ex vivo production of tumor necrosis factor-a P  0.04 in the WG group than in the RG group which were positively associated with plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations.

There were no between-group differences in the IS however there was a moderate inverse correlation between the IS and total alkylresorcinol in the WG group Pearson's r  20.40 P  0.02.There was a difference in the change from baseline to follow-up between the 2 groups in LPS-stimulated TNF-a production DWG compared with DRG mean 6 SEM 2131 6 1399 pgmL P  0.04 Table 10 which was mainly due to a decrease in the RG group.

The medication exclusion criteria included the use of antibiotics within the past 3 mo the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or antihistamines or the inability to discontinue the use of these substances for 72 h before the first-day blood draw until 48 h after receipt of a delayed-type hypersensitivity DTH skin-test implant and the use of immunosuppressive drugs.

The a diversity in stool samples that were col- lected at baseline was lower in the WG group n  38 than in the RG group n  39 P  0.01.

At the family level there was a significant relative change toward a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae abun- dance in the WG group than in the RG group DWG compared with DRG mean 6 SEM 20.07 6 0.11 FDR-adjusted P  0.25 Table 6.
