Furthermore there was no significant dif- ference in the change in triglycerides LDLs HDLs or VLDLsbetween WG or RG groups data not shown but a signifi- cantly smaller decrease from baseline to postintervention in total cholesterol was shown in the WG group than in the RG group 3.61 6 3.43 compared with 11.30 6 3.88 mgdLP  0.05.Dietary intake and adherenceBody weight was maintained within 1 kg of baseline values according to the study design.

We observed increased intake of cholesterol in the RG group this finding resulted in a small difference in cho- lesterol intake when the change between WG and RG groups was compared.

Compared with the RG group intakes of iron magnesium zinc and selenium were higher in the WG group however intakes of vitamin D thiamin niacin and folate were lower.The consumption of WGs as expected resulted in an increasein total dietary fiber intake in the WG group than in the RG group.

As expected no changes in plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations were shown in the RG group after the intervention phase which confirmed participant adherence.Stool weight frequency pH water content and SCFAsWe observed an increase in bowel-movement frequency P  0.03 and stool weight P  8.39 3 1028 in the WG group Table 3 with no change in the RG group which resulted in between-group dif- ferences in bowel-movement frequency P  0.02 and stool weight P  1.77 3 1027.

Changes in stool acetate DWG compared with DRG mean 6 SEM 2.13 6 1.36 mmolL P  0.02 and total SCFA 2.70 6 2.25 mmolL P  0.05 were larger in the WG group than in the RG group mainly because of a decline in the RG group Table 4.

Results Compared with the RG group the WG group had increased plasma total alkyresorcinols a measure of WG intake P  0.0001 stool weight P  0.0001 stool frequency P  0.02 and short- chain fatty acid SCFA producer Lachnospira false-discovery rate FDR-corrected P  0.25 but decreased pro-inflammatory Entero- bacteriaceae FDR-corrected P  0.25.

Changes in stool acetate P  0.02 and total SCFAs P  0.05 were higher in the WG group than in the RG group.

We also showed that there was a higher percentage of terminal effector memory T cells P  0.03 and LPS-stimulated ex vivo production of tumor necrosis factor-a P  0.04 in the WG group than in the RG group which were positively associated with plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations.
