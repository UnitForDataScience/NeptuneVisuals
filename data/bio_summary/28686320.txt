the discov- ery of sv2c in gwas prompted functional studies to decipher its role in pd53 and pharmacogenetic studies to test it as a candidate marker for drug response.54 functional studies found that disrupted expression of sv2c is a unique pathological feature of pd it causes reduced dopamine release in the dorsal striatum reduced striatal dopamine content disrupted a- synuclein expression abnormal motor function in rodents and alterations in neurochemical effects of nicotine.53 a clinical study examined sv2c and other biological variables as potential markers for l-dopa dose response and adverse effects.54 the original gwas had revealed a beneficial effect of the sv2c rs30196c allele in interaction with smoking the low- est pd risk was seen in individuals who had 2 copies of c and intermediate risk reduction in individuals with 1 c. a similar additive pattern was seen in the clinical study the presence of each c allele signifi- cantly reduced l-dopa dose by 76 mgday suggesting that individuals who have 1 or 2 copies of the rs30196c allele require lower doses of medication.54microbiomemicrobiome refers to the collective genomes of the microorganisms living within our body.

they also call for replication in independent cohorts when there were already at least 5 published studies of slc6a3 and response to l-dopa with conflicting out- comes2 and another negative study has since followed.24this latest study by masellis et al24 titled dopamine d2 receptor gene variants and response to rasagiline in early parkinson's disease a pharmacogenetic study raises the bar for rigor in study design and execution.

to ensure that sufficient dna is available for pharmacogenetics clinical trials the drug regulation agencies in the united states food and drug administration and europe european medicines agency strongly encour- age collection and banking of dna samples from all participants in all arms of all clinical trials.18 pharma- cogenomics although a relatively new field has already produced genetic predictors of drug response that are being used in the clinic for the treatment of cancer heart disease pain depression autoimmune disease immunosuppression and hiv infection.16candidate gene studies pharmacogeneticspharmacogenetics as opposed to pharmacogeno- mics refers to the study of candidate genes one or a few genes at a time in relation to drug response.

a phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine for the treatment of pd reported a deleterious interaction between caffeine and creatine that was dependent on the grin2a genotype.50 the second study reported an association between the grin2a genotype and l-dopa -induced dyskinesia.51 clinical trials of caffeine for the treatment of pd have reported either beneficial effects37-39 or no effect on the rate of disease progres- sion.52 pharmacogenetics studies are under way to determine if the variable results of caffeine could be explained by the grin2a genotype.gwas of a gene-smoking interaction on pd risk identified the sv2c gene32 which encodes the synap- tic vesicle protein 2c.

because the aim of the study was to test an algorithm to predict the develop- ment of pd individuals who reported conversion to pd were followed by phone and then a home visit to confirm pd diagnosis according to the standard uk brain bank criteria.online studies are feasible and reliable generatetroves of data fast and inexpensively and can be scaled upward to meet any sample size requirement enabling a well-powered and comprehensive explora- tion of the many factors that affect treatment response.

here i will use the 2 most recently published studies not cap- tured in published reviews for illustration.moreau et al recently reported a study titled polymorphism of the dopamine transporter type 1 gene modifies the treatment response in parkinson's disease.23 the study makes an exciting case they show data that variation in a highly plausible gene slc6a3 dopamine transporter 1 is associated with the efficacy of l-dopa and methylphenidate for motor symptoms with impressive-looking statistics p 5 0.0001 and proposeour results suggest that to better relieve gait disorders it may be worth increasing the dose of l-dopa in patients harboring the slc6a3 rs3836790 66 or slc6a3 rs28363170 1010 genotypes.

phar- macogenetic studies of pd exemplify this problem.there have been more than 50 articles on pd phar- macogenetics and all have produced inconsistent results for all genes investigated.2 there are several review articles on pharmacogenetics of pd one in par- ticular2 presents easy viewing of the results from each of the 501 studies for every gene that was tested.

smokingnicotine and caffeine were chosen for these studies because they are robustly associated with reduced risk of pd in epidemiological studies3334 have shown neuroprotective properties in animal models3536 and have been pursued in clinical trials for treatment of pd with variable results.37-39gwas of a gene-caffeine interaction on pd risk identified a block of variants that mapped to the grin2a gene.31 grin2a encodes the nmda recep- tor 2a subunit that binds glutamate.

dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been noted in many disorders56 includ- ing pd.57-62 the effect seen in pd was highly significant independently of the confounding effects of medica- tions diet gastrointestinal symptoms including consti- pation sex age and demographics.57in a study of nearly 4000 individuals aimed at iden- tifying variables with the most profound effects on the gut microbiome medication was found to have the largest effect size on the total variance.63 the effect size on microbiome was larger for medication than it was for parameters that defined blood bowel diet health anthropometrics or lifestyle.63 there is a 2- way interaction between drugs and the microbiome.64 the microbiome facilitates the metabolism of prescrip- tion drugs directly via microbial metabolites and indi- rectly by affecting host xenobiotic metabolism and can therefore affect the efficacy and toxicity of medi- cations.6566 in turn medications could alter the com- position of the microbiome antibiotics is the classic case cause dysbiosis and compromise health.636768two studies have examined pd medications in rela- tion to the gut microbiome.

does the pretreatment interindividual variability in the microbiome determine the efficacy and toxicity of medication does the med- ication change the microbiome and cause adverse effects depending on the answers the microbiomemay prove to be a useful biomarker for drug develop- ment and pharmacogenomics-guided treatment.moving forwardhow do we address the scattered candidate gene data on efficacy and toxicity of various pd drugs one option is for the groups to come together agree on a focused study design patient selection criteria polymorphism medication and outcome pool their data and if they have enough analytic power for dis- covery and replication retest the candidate genes.

another example is the discovery of the interleukin 28b gene as the predictor of drug response in treating hepatitis c in 3 independent genome-wide asso- ciation studies gwass conducted in 3 different popula- tions.28-30 despite the clear advantages of genome-wide studies there have been far fewer pharmacogenomics studies than candidate gene studies because they cost more require larger sample sizes and demand a more sophisticated study design and execution.there have been 2 pharmacogenomics studies for pd.
