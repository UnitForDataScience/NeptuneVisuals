email of G. barretti mortalities has not been empirically determined and no experimental research has ascertained the thermal sensitivity of this sponge species.Experimental and field research on shallow water sponge species has documented species-specific responses to elevated SST.

Cell turnover rates can be highly variable amongst sponge speciesand it is plausible that this process occurs over longer time-frames in G. bar- retti than has been documented for tropical sponges this species is a deep-water boreal sponge cold water and may therefore exhibit a slower process of cell turnover in comparison to warmer water sponges.

We aimed to replicate the thermal event that occurred on Tisler Reef to quantify the effect of thermal stress on G. barretti and whether this stressor alone is responsible for the reported mass mortality of G. barretti individuals on Tisler reef.

Of interest in the interaction are the trends at exposure temperatures of 11 degC and 12 degC where marginal means the mean of the marginalprobability distribution for G. barretti individuals were consistently higher at each sampling time point than the marginal means for G. barretti individuals exposed to 7 degC and 9 degC with the exception of the recovery period Fig.

Respiration rates for G. barretti individu- als exposed to 11 degC 2.35 - 0.45 mmol O2 gtissue DW-1 h-1 and 12 degC 2.20 - 0.20 mmol O2 gtissue DW-1 h-1 were more than 2 times higher than G. barretti individuals exposed to 7 degC 1.13 - 0.15 mmol O2 gtissue DW-1 h-1 and 9 degC 0.88 - 0.16 mmol O2 gtissue DW-1 h-1 Fig.

Trends of increased marginal means for G. barretti explants exposed to water temperatures 4 and 5 degC above ambient temperatures 11 and 12 degC respectively were consistently higher than G. barretti explants exposed to ambient temperature 7 degC for the first 24 h Fig.

Of interest in the interaction are the trends at exposure temperatures of 11 degC and 12 degC where marginal means for G. barretti individuals were consistently higher at each sampling time point after 12 h than the marginal means for G. barretti individuals exposed to 7 degC and 9 degC Fig.

The proportion of destabilised lysosomal membranes for G. barretti individuals exposed to 11 degC 24 - 1.48 and 12 degC 39.7 - 2.8 were 2-5 times higher than G. barretti individuals exposed to 7 degC 7.6 - 1.3 and 9 degC 10.4 - 0.7 Fig.

The apparent thermal tolerance of G. barretti contrasts earlier field observations where mass mortalities of G. barretti at Tisler Reef coincided with acute thermal stress events.
