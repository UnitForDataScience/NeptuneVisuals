in conclusion onion supplementation in broiler produced a positive effect on performance gut microflora and intestinal histomorphology.introductionin the last few decades a number of feed additives have been used in poultry feed.

these feed additives may result in higher growth performance and efficient feed utilization in poultry  .

the feed conversion ratio fcr was calculated from the recorded data of feed intake and body weight.analysis of selected gut microflorafor the population strength of lactobacillus streptococcus and e. coli in the gastrointestinal tract the gut content of the ileum and cecum were taken from 32 randomly selected birds 8 birds per group on 42 day of age.

three hundred and twenty day old broiler chicks ross were randomly divided into four groups as a b c and d. group a served as control without any supplementation group b c and d was supplemented with onion powder at the rate of 1.5 2 and 2.5 gkg of feed respectively.

supplementation of onion significantly p  0.05 increased weight gain and feed consump- tion.

commonly used feed additives include antimicrobials biological products emulsifiers binders herbs antioxidants ph control agents and enzymes  .

feed additives are used not only as growth promoters but also stabilize the gut microflora by preventing some specific microorganisms  .

in the last decade antibiotics used in the animal feed have been subjected to severe criticism since they pose a potential threat for human being by producing resistance in the host against the bacteria .

resultantly the european union eu in 2006 banned the addition of antibiotics in animal feed as growth promoters .

feed additives originated from plants have gained an increasing interest in poultry diets due to their safety wide range doses and almost no adverse effects .

group a was kept as control while b c and d were given onion powder at the rate of 1.5 2.0 and 2.5 gkg of feed.

the experiment was continued till day 42. the basal composition of the feed is given in .

the onion powder was given mixed at the rate of 1.5 02 and 2.5 gkg of feed in groups b c and d respectively.

the birds had free access to the feed throughout the experiment.
