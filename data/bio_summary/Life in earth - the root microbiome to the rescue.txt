recent advances in nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled a new generation of research into soil microbial communities and offer the opportunity to better under- stand and hence exploit this resource.advances in soil microbiome analysissoil microbiomes are intricate highly diverse ecosystems containing thousands of interacting microorganisms--a recent analysis of the microbiome of disease-suppressive soils identified over 33 000 bacterial and archaeal otus in the sugar beet rhizosphere  rapidly sequence and identify dna extracted from soil samples has enabled the development of several powerful metagenomic analysis techniques .

total microbiome approaches by definition are more superficial in their analyses while complete assignation of functional genes to particular microbial otus in the soil is challenging although thereconstruction of a draft genome from a novel soil metha- nogen indicates that this may become more commonplace in the future .

we propose that a combination of total community studies with more in-depth analysis of key culturable microbial taxa will further our understanding of rhizosphere microbial inter- actions more effectively than either approach taken in isolation.biocontrol pseudomonads in the soil microbiomeas the harmful environmental impacts of chemical pes- ticides become more apparent manipulation of the soil and plant-associated microbiota is gaining increasing rec- ognition as a potential alternative treatment for a range of crop diseases and pests.

this paper describes and characterises the huge interspecies diversity in the rhizo- sphere soil and shows how plants can exploit soil microbial consortia for protection against fungal infection.in this manuscript we outline a novel approach for the examination ofmicrobial genomes in a complex environment and use this to examine the relationship between crop variety fungal load and pseudomonas genetics in defined wheat fields.a comprehensive examination of the leaf- and root-derived microbiota of arabidopsis.

next- generation sequencing has enabled a new generation of research into soil microbiomes presenting the opportunity to better understand and exploit these valuable resources.

soil bacterial communities are both highly complex and variable and contain vast interspecies and intraspecies diversity both of which respond to environmental variation.

additionally the soil microbiome holds great promise for contributing to more environmentally benign agriculture.

ampli- con sequence analysis of marker genes typically 16s rrna in the case of bacteria enable us to characterize the relative abundance of different species in phyllosphere and rhizosphere communities  while metatranscriptomic approaches may be used to examine the metabolic activities and regulatory mechanisms that function in different environments .while much has been learned about the relative abundance of different microbial phyla and genera and the functional and metabolic characteristics of the plant and soil-associated microbiome  it is also impera- tive to understand the metabolic natural product and genomic diversity associated with individual species in the soil system to obtain a better understanding of micro- bial function  that the metabolic behaviour of the nitrogen fixing spe- cies rhizobium varies profoundly between the rhizo- spheres of different plant species .

these important widespread soil-dwelling microbes have an established role in the development of take-all suppressive soils  where the fungal pathogen is maintained at a low level in the soil but is unable to cause disease.

their genomes are correspondingly complex encoding around 6000 genes and with a high degree of intraspecies diversity--the pseudomonas core genome represents as little as 20 of an individual bacterial genome  over to signal transduction phenotypic output loci and secondary metabolism  genomic and metabolic plasticity among the soil pseudo- monads allows both individual bacteria and the microbial population as a whole to effectively adapt to different plant-soil-microbiome environments.pseudomonas plant colonisation is a complex tightly con- trolled process that begins with chemotaxis into the rhizosphere along a gradient of root exudates followed by surface association and migration on the rhizoplane  and ultimately the formation of a bacterial biofilm  flagella and type iv pili and the production of biosurfac- tants which together enable coordinated swarming motil- ity .
