furthermore it could prove beneficial to enrich nod2-stimulating ligands in the intestines by usingprobiotics and prebiotics.disclosuresall authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.acknowledgmentsmicrobiota and absorbed into the bloodstream reaching the bone marrow to modulate bone metabolism through nod2.recently the probiotic bacteria species lactobacillus reuteri was reported to decrease intestinal inflammation but to increase bone density in mice.44 lactobacillus paracasei and a mixture of other lactobacillus species have been shown to alleviate ovariectomy-induced bone loss by reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the ranklopg ratio.45 however the exact mechanism for the improved bone health observed after oral administration of probiotics remains to be elucidated.

for example mdp and its derivatives were found to induce adjuvant activity and antitumor activity.20 however a recent report has demonstrated that pretreatment with mdp protects mice from chemically-induced colitis.21 activation of nod2 by mdp also reduces porphyromonas gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss.22 in addition mutation of the nod2 gene is associated with pathogenesis in human inflammatory diseases especially inflammatory bowel diseases ibds.23 a decrease in the mass and mineral density of bones was observed in patients with ibd.24 recently it was reported that peptidoglycan fragments released from the intestinal microbiota are absorbed distributed and even delivered into the bone marrow where they promote neutrophil functions.25 thus the peptidoglycan fragments delivered into the bone marrow might potentially be involved in the regulation of bone metabolism.

osteoblasts originating from mesenchymal stem cells1 are differentiated by various osteogenic growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 bmp-2 and fibroblast growth factor-2 fgf-2.2 they upregulate the expression and function of runt-related transcription factor 2 runx2 which is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation skeletal development and morphogenesis.3 the osteogenic factors are involved in the expression of osteogenic marker genes including alkaline phosphatase alp bone sialoprotein bsp osteopontin and osteocalcin.4 in contrast osteoclasts originating from a monocytemacrophage lineage are multinucleated giant cells mncs differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor m-csf and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand rankl.5-7 osteoclast differentiation is regulated by the ratio of rankl and the antagonistic decoy receptor osteoprotegerinopg mainly produced by osteoblasts and stromal cells.8 rankl stimulates osteoclast differentiation via the activation of the transcription factors nfatc1 ap-1 and nf-kb causing the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase trap cathepsin k calcitonin receptor and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein dc-stamp.9microbiota continuously interact with the host and regulate the development of the immune system10 innate immunity11 and bone homeostasis.12 peptidoglycan is one of the most common and abundant cell wall components of bacteria.

primary bone marrow stromal cells bmscs were prepared from bone marrow cells and cultured in a-mem gibco supplemented with 10 fbs 100 uml penicil- lin and 100 mgml streptomycin for 14 days.

these results indicate that mdp increases bone mass by increasing bone formation with decreasing bone destruc- tion in vivo.both preventive and therapeutic effects of mdp on rankl-induced osteoporosisto examine the effects of mdp on osteoporosis we used a rankl-induced osteoporosis model.

2h-l indicating that mdp alleviates bone loss induced by osteoporosis.activation of nod2 signaling enhances bone massit has been shown that mdp is recognized by nod2.30 we next determined whether nod2 deficiency affects bone metabolism.

for example in a murine periodontitis model nod2 deficiency leads to an increase ofgingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss through the induction of osteoclast activity.22 moreover reduced bone mass and reduced bone formation were observed in patients with crohn's disease a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract in which a mutation in the nod2 gene is closely associated with the disease.24 in general nod2 is a microbial sensor sensing mdp constituents of the cell walls of gram-positive and gram- negative bacteria.18 indeed the recognition of gut microbiota by nod2 is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.42 interestingly altered gut microbiota is a typical characteristic of crohn's disease24 and an increase in bacteroidetes is observed in the gut microbiota of both nod2-- mice and patients with crohn's disease.43 therefore we suggest that peptidoglycan fragments containing mdp moieties are released from gutagainst osteoporosis have been developed to block osteoclast differentiation and activation.48 for example antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonate that potently inhibit osteoclasts have been clinically used.

next we performed calcein double-labeling experiments to examine whether the increase in trabecular bone volume was due to enhancement of new bone formation.

1g h. these results suggest that the increased bone volume by mdp results from enhanced new bone formation.

therefore mdp could be a new therapy for the treatment of osteoporotic bone diseases.runx2 is a well-known essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation and the absence of runx2 in mice yielded a complete lack of bone formation due to the blocking of osteoblast function.3 our study showed that the distal femur of mdp-administered mice exhibited an increased expression of runx2.

notably enhanced expression and transcriptional activity of runx2 appears to be a typical mechanism of action for bone- forming agents such as bmp2 insulin-like growth factor-1 transforming growth factor-b and fgf-2.35-37 the increase in runx2 activity subsequently stimulates osteogenic marker genes including alp bsp and opn to increase bone formation.38therefore because mdp increases runx2 activity by activating map kinase mdp could reasonably promote bone formation.the inhibitory effect of mdp on osteoclast differentiation appears to be indirect by modulating the ranklopg ratio in osteoblasts because mdp alone did not affect osteoclast differentiation but inhibited it in the osteoblastosteoclast co- culture system.
