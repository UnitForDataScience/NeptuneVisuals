we determined inflammation endothelial dysfunction and the potential contribution of gut microbiota by measur- ing high sensitive c-reactive protein hscrp adma l- arginine and tmao in hiv-infected persons with t2d hiv  t2d and three control groups hiv-infected persons without t2d hiv  t2d- uninfected persons with t2d hiv-t2d and healthy controls hiv-t2d-.methodsparticipantswe performed a cross-sectional study including 100 par- ticipants 25 hiv  t2d 25 hiv  t2d- 22 hiv-t2d and 28 hiv-t2d-.

l-arginineadma ratio is important since adma by a competitive reversible blocking of no-production from l-arginine affects endothelial function  .the gut microbiota is altered in both hiv infection and in t2d  and studies suggest that altered microbiota is associated with increased inflammation recently trimethylamine-n-oxide tmao a metabolite from dietary carnitine and choline was found to promote atherosclerosis and predict cvd in persons with t2d as well as hiv-uninfected cohorts production of tmao seems to be dependent on metab- olism by gut microbiota as one week of antibiotics is sufficient to block its formation  since the gut microbiota is altered in both hiv infection and in t2d elevated tmao may contribute to inflam- mation and endothelial dysfunction in these patients.little is known about the combined effect of hiv infec- tion and t2d on inflammation and endothelial function.

however only two partic- ipants were infected with hcv one in the hiv  t2d and one in hiv  t2d- group.increased inflammation in hiv  t2d compared to hiv  t2d-hiv  t2d had a higher hscrp compared to hiv  t2d- and hiv-t2d- 3.2 0.86-12.0 vs. 1.5 0.6-3.8 p  0.032 and 1.1 0.48-2.8 p  0.002 respectivelybut not compared to hiv-t2d 3.2 0.86-12.0 vs. 2.8 0.48-2.8 p  0.860. the percentage of hiv  t2d hiv  t2d- hiv-t2d and hiv-t2d- with hscrpabove cut-off 3 mgl was 50 19 47 and 11 re- spectively fig.

concentration of tmao was comparable in the four groups but a positive correlation between adma and tmao was found mainly to be driven by persons with hiv  t2d suggesting an association between gut microbiota and endothelial dysfunction in this group.higher adma and lower l-arginineadma ratio were found in patients with both hiv infection and t2d indicating increased endothelial dysfunction in pa- tients with both hiv infection and t2d.

larger prospective studies to determine if adma is associated with clinical end- points in hiv-infected persons especially in hiv- infected persons with t2d would be very interesting.conclusionsin conclusion our findings imply that elevated inflam- mation and endothelial dysfunction could be factors contributing to elevated risk of cvd in hiv-infected persons with t2d compared to hiv- infected persons without t2d.

however new challenges are emerging and in- cidence of cardiovascular disease cvd is increased in hiv-infected persons compared to the general correspondence 1department of infectious diseases rigshospitalet university hospital of copenhagen opgang 86 3 sal blegdamsvej 9 2100 kbh o copenhagen denmarkfull list of author information is available at the end of the articlepopulation chronic inflammation resulting in endo- thelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis may contribute to increased risk of cvd in hiv infection type 2 diabetes t2d is also characterized by chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction  and t2d is an independent risk factor for cvd in the general popula- tion as well as in the hiv-infected population  .

thus with an aging hiv-infected population and an emerging worldwide diabetes epidemic a combination of hiv infec- tion and t2d may become a clinical challenge.asymmetric dimethylarginine adma is elevated in both hiv infection and t2d  .

the aim of this study was to determine if concurrent t2d in hiv-infected persons results in higher levels of inflam- mation and endothelial dysfunction compared to either hiv infection by itself or t2d in uninfected persons.

we hypothesized that higher inflammation and elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction would be found in per- sons with both hiv and t2d compared to persons with either hiv or t2d.

however in other studies in un- infected individuals with metabolic syndrome or t2d and 48 and 130 increase in adma was found com- pared to controls assuming the same difference between hiv-infected individuals with and without t2d 0.59 mm vs. 0.87 mm power  0.8 and alpha  0.05 a minimum of 20 individuals are needed in each group.

inclusion criteria for persons with t2d were confirmed t2d with one or more of the following hba1c  48 mmolmol 2 tests fasting blood glucose 7 mmoll 2 tests or 2 h blood glucose level on 11.1 mmoll after a glucose tolerance test.

more participants with hiv  t2d had hscrp above cut-off compared to hiv  t2d- and hiv-t2d- but not compared to hiv-t2d p  0.05 p  0.003 and p  0.935 respectively.to further investigate potential predictors of inflam- mation a multivariate linear regression analysis was per- formed adjusting for age gender group hiv  t2d hiv  t2d- hiv-t2d and hiv-t2d- bmi cd4count and current smoking.

correlations between hscrp and tmao were not found in the total population or in any of the groups data not shown.higher adma in hiv  t2d compared to hiv  t2d- hiv  t2d had higher concentration of adma com- pared to hiv  t2d- hiv-t2d and hiv-t2d- 0.67 mm 0.63-0.72 vs. 0.60 mm 0.57-0.64 p  0.017and 0.57 mm 0.51-0.63 p  0.008 and 0.55 mm 0.52-0.58 p  0.001 respectively fig.

however in the total popu- lation there was a moderate positive correlation be- tween tmao and adma rs  0.32 p  0.001 which was driven by a strong correlation in hiv  t2d rs  0.63 p  0.001 and not significant in the other groups hiv  t2d- rs  0.35 p  0.088 hiv-t2d rs  -0.20 p  0.374 hiv-t2d- rs  0.20 p  0.305.discussionboth hiv infection and t2d are characterized by chronic inflammation and increased risk of cvd.

this finding may be of clinical relevance since studies in hiv-infected populations have found elevated adma to be independently associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension and increased cor- onary artery calcium score furthermore in the setting of t2d elevated adma was found to be associ- ated with macrovascular disease finally adma was previously shown to enhance the predictive value of hscrp for cvd in patients with t2d a recent study found elevated ratio between adma and systemic dimethylarginine sdma in hiv infec- tion.
