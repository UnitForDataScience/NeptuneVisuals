In general there are no studies on the antibacterial antagonistic capacity of the intestinal microbiota of O. mykiss.The main objective of this research was to analyse the antibacterial ability of some members of the intestinal microbiota of specimens of O. mykiss on various bacterial target strains that can contaminate food and cause disease in humans.Materials and MethodsTwenty adult males of O. mykiss between 1.3 and 1.6 kg each were obtained from the fish farming Panguilemu located in the Bio-Bio Region Chile.

2010.From the results of this study it is inter- esting to note the potential biotechnological use of these antibacterial products which could be incorporated into human foodsResults and DiscussionIn the intestinal microbiota of 20 O. mykiss specimens the presence of bacterial species with antagonistic capacity against target strains was detected.

Samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min and as above target strains were sown plated with 10 uL of supernatant and incu- bated at 37degC for 10 h. The diameter of inhibitory halos was evaluated as indicator of antibacterial action.species detected in the intestinal microbiota of the studied specimens of O. mykiss had been described previously Pond et al.

It is fur- ther noted that the catalase enzyme does notalter the biological activity of the product studied discarding the presence of hydro- gen peroxide as an antibacterial agent.Considering the peptidic nature of bac- teriocins one can argue that the intestinal microbiota of the studied specimens of O. mykiss is composed of bacterial genera with bacteriocinogenic capacity.

To test the antibacterial activity of the selected colonies three target strains were used one ATCC and two belonging to the collection of bacterial strains of the Microbiology Department MD-UTAL at University of Talca.

The obtained bacterial species with a wider spectrum of antibacterial action were L. lac- tis and H. alvei with activity against five target strains followed by P. shigelloides which was active against four strains.

It was inter- esting to note that some genera isolated from the intestinal microbiota presented a broad spectrum of antibacterial action against the target strains studied Table 2.

In addi- tion these products could act secondarily as food preservatives.Considering the chemical nature of antibacterial products elaborated by the intestinal microbiota of O. mykiss and according to the results obtained in this study it is interesting to note that the bacte- riocins are closely related to their potential application in the food industry and human health.

Further studies of these antibacterial prod- ucts are essential for potential use in the future.ConclusionsThe detection of substances of a pro- teinaceous nature possibly bacteriocins produced by bacteria of the intestinal microbiota of O. mykiss offers the possibil- ity to further study these products in order to establish biotechnological developments in the area of health protection and food biopreservation.ReferencesBalciunas EM Castillo FA Dimitrov ST Gombossy de Melo Franco BD Converti A Pinheiro de Souza OliveiraR 2013.
