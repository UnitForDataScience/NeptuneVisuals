These cohorts table S1 include i 11 fresh- frozen primary colorectal cancers and paired liver metastases frozen paired cohort ii 77 fresh-frozen primary colorectal cancers with de- tailed recurrence information frozen primary cohort iii published data from 430 resected fresh-frozen colon carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas 26 TCGA cohort together with data from 201 resected fresh-frozen hepatocellular carcinomas from TCGA 27  iv 101 formalin- fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal carcinomas and paired liver metastases FFPE paired cohort and v 13 fresh primary colorectal cancers usedwith 99.9 average nucleotide identity despite the tissue being collected months P2 or even years P1 apart Fig.

Our finding of nearly identical viable Fusobacterium strains in matched primary and metastatic colo- rectal cancers confirms the persistence of viable Fusobacterium species through the metastatic pro- cess and suggests that Fusobacterium species may migrate with the colorectal cancer cells to the metastatic site.To quantitate the relative abundance of Fuso- bacterium and to evaluate the overall microbiome in the paired primary and metastatic tumors we performed RNA sequencing of 10 primary cancers and their matched liver metastases from the frozen paired cohort P1 to P6 and P8 to P11.

The samples are separated into three groups Fusobacterium-positive primary tumor and metastases n  6 pairs Fusobacterium-positive primary tumor and Fusobacterium-negative metastases n  1 pair and Fusobacterium-negative primary tumor and metastases n  3 pairs.

Quantitative poly- merase chain reaction qPCR analysis showed that 9 of 11 82 snap-frozen primary tumors table S2 were positive for Fusobacterium in the primary tumor patients one through nine P1 through P9 we could isolate Fusobacterium spe- cies from 73 of these tumors n 8 of 11 tumors P1 through P8 Fig.

This finding extends previous results showing the presence of Fusobacterium nucleic acids in hepatic and lymph node metastases of colon cancer 7 22 28 to now demonstrate that viable Fusobacterium species are present in dis- tant metastases.To address whether the same Fusobacterium is present in primary cancers and metastases we performed whole-genome sequencing of pure Fusobacterium isolates from primary and meta- static tumors from two patients P1 and P2.

In contrast therewas little similarity between bacterial sequences in the primary colorectal cancer and liver meta- stasis in the lone sample where Fusobacterium was present in the primary cancer but not de- tected in the metastasis Fig.

We found that 43 n  44 of 101 of primary colorectal cancers tested positive for Fusobacterium by qPCR and 45 n  20 of 44 of liver metastases arising from these primary tumors were Fusobacterium- positive fig.
