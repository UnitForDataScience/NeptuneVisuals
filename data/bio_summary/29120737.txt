The spread of a transgene in a population is thought to require its super-Mendelian transmission via gene drive B. Gene drive is based on germline-specific invasion of the transgene from a chromo- some to its homologous partner making heterozygous mosquitoes able to transmitCell Host  Microbe 22 November 8 2017 a 2017 Elsevier Inc. 577Cell Host  MicrobePreviewsthe transgene to greater than 50 of their progeny often nearing 100  .

Starting with a population where 10 of males and 10 of females are heterozygous transgene carriers first generation after crossing WT and homozygous transgene carriers 9.75 of the progeny are expected to carry the transgene according to Mendelianinheritance.

In addition to this natural influence the gut microbiota is seen as a prospective tool to target disease transmission whether by selection of microbiota strains that naturally cause refractoriness or by paratransgenesis--genetic engineering of a microbiota strain to confer resistance to parasite infection.

Interest- ingly transgene spread in the population was favored by mating choice making WT mosquitoes more likely to mate with GM ones.

Strategies Proposed in the Highlighted Studies to Limit Malaria Transmission Using the Mosquito MicrobiotaTransmission-blocking strategies involved in the studies of on genetically modified GM mosquitoes and of on GM bacteria from the microbiota.Inheritance of a malaria-blocking transgene may be increased by gene drive or microbiota-mediated preference to cross-mating versus assortative mating.

GM mosquitoes harbor a microbiota of altered composition with a lower total bacterial load and it is not yet known whether the changes in load andor composition are responsible for the mating preference.

No pheromone has been identi- fied so far and previous cross-population mating experiments suggested that assortative mating choice was mostly the fact of females Figure 1.

Meanwhile S. marcescens is widely distributed in nature suggesting that such a strain may not be too disruptive to the environment.In a second study published in the same issue Dimopoulos and collaborators   elucidate a new mechanism for propagation of a transmission-blocking transgene in a mosquito population.

Gene drive leads to an increase in the chance of transmission resulting in up to 19 of the progeny carrying the transgene.

As these crosses are the most frequent the effect on transgene inheritance is significant.
