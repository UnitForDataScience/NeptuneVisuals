Similary advanced oxidation protein products AOPP a marker of oxidative damage of proteins are formed during oxidative stress by an inter- action between proteins and chlorinated compounds .

Association between oxidative status and the composition of intestinal microbiota along the gastrointestinal tractMarianna Gyuraszova Alexandra Kovalcikova Roman Gardlik Institute of Molecular Biomedicine Faculty of Medicine Comenius University 811 08 Bratislava Slovakiaa r t i c l e i n f o Article historyReceived 6 September 2016Accepted 19 April 2017a b s t r a c t Studies have shown that the microbiota along the gastrointestinal tract GIT plays an important role when it comes to the maintenance of its proper functions.

In summary we offer some insight into the differences between the oxidative status along the GIT of rats and some advice concerning supportive antioxidant therapy of gastrointestinal diseases.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Intestinal bacteria catalyze the reaction of amine with nitrite to produce nitrosamine which rapidly induces oxidative stress .

The continuous formation of ROS in the GIT is the result of the interaction between intestinal mucosa symbiotic bacteria and dietary factors.

Simi- larly in chicken it has been shown that the major groups of the chicken ileum and caecum microbiota are lactobacilli Enterococcus cecorum and butyrate producing bacteria .Another study which dealt with human intestinal microbiota has shown that microbiota in the jejunum differ from the ileum the ascending colon and the rectum.

It has been shown that AOPP contributes to the progression of IBD and that they cause intestinal epithelial cell death and intestinal tissue injury .

The imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ROS and their elimination by antioxidants leads to oxidative stress.

How- ever imbalance between ROS production and their elimination by antioxidants leads to oxidative stress.
