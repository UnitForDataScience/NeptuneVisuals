additionally although many studies have shown the relationship between various gingival tissue manipulations and bacteremia of oral species  the precise mechanisms by which oral periodontal patho- gens colonize and proliferate in human artery walls has not yet been elucidated -.metagenomics studies have largely characterizedthe nature of the oral microbiome in dental plaque associated with periodontal disease  so that comprehensive correspondence with bacterial profilesof arteries from atherosclerotic patients may be estab- lished in downstream investigations.scientific evidence supporting a possible role of oral bacterial species in atherosclerosis relies to a large extent on the detection and identification of bacterial dna in human arterial wall tissues or ather- osclerotic plaque in cross-sectional study designs .

proposed mechanisms include 1 a distant site colonization by oral microbiota resulting in heigh- tened immune reactions from various origins e.g.

genus probes can provide an estimate of 1 unidentified oral and non-oral species or 2 the presence of genera of known species for which a specific species probe within probeseq against the v3-v4 16s rrna gene sequence has not been designed.

total hits by species or genus probe by patient were used for statistical analyses.statistical analysesshannon and simpson alpha diversity indexes were determined using an online open source programjournal of oral microbiology3 .

the frequency of unmatched reads ranged from 5.9 to 83.1 m sd  29091.7 20309.9  reflective of the presence of 1 non-oral bacterial species 2 novel oral species for which probeseq probes have not been devel- oped or 3 low-quality reads possibly resulting from bacterial dna degradation.

homings data obtained for coronary n  32 and femoral n  10 artery tissues showed the presence of 230 and 118 oral bacterial species in these tissues respectively with 103 species in common .

these two taxa had similar hits per patient distributions in combined coronary and femoral artery tissues data sets figure 1a and b. however p. gingivalis was significantly more abundant p  0.0005 figure 1athis is the first study to report using homings targeted metagenomics to screen for nearly 600 known oral bacterial species in artery tissues clinically unaffected with atherosclerosis that were obtained from patients with atherosclerotic cvd who under- went coronary or femoral artery bypass surgery.

although homings focuses mainly on oral taxa approximately 70-90 of the taxa were accounted for with significant detection at the genus level by species and genus probes.
