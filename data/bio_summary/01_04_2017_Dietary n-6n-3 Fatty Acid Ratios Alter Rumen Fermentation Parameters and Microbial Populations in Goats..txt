the rumen ph obtained in this study was within the range 5.8-7 for normal rumen function.increasing the n-6n-3 ratios increased the rumen ph in goats in this study which is in line with the results of kim et al.where rumen ph numerically increased with increasing ratio of n-6 to n-3 from 2.31 to 12.81 of growingalr low n-6n-3 fatty acid ratio 2.271 mr medium n-6n-3 fattyacid ratio 5.011 hr high n-6n-3 fatty acid ratio 10.381.

thus a general understanding of the intricate ruminal microbial populations their interactions and their response to different diets is essential.the impacts of dietary fat differing in n-6n-3 pufa ratios on rumen microflora have been examined in sheep and cattle.-nonetheless there is a dearth of similar in vivo studies in goats whose rumen microflora might have a different response to dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios based on the suggested interspecies differences in lipid metabolism.this underscores the need for further studies in different production systems toallow cognizant choices and tailored decisions in the use of dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios in ruminants.

in contrast diets differing in n-6n-3 pufa ratios did not affect total vfa in sheepand cattlewhereas decreasing dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios decreased total vfa in sheepand goats.dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios did not affect the molar proportion of acetate in the rumen of goats.

a similar trend was observed in sheep.the linear decrease in c182n-6 and increase in c183n-3with decreasing n-6n-3 pufa ratios resulted in a linear decrease in the n-6n-3 ratios from 11.58 to 2.66 which reflected the decreasing dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios.the proportion of c181 trans-11 increased as dietary n-6n- 3 pufa ratios increased.

the n-6 to n-3 ratio of fatty acids in ruminant tissue is influenced by dietary fatty acids and can influence the concentration of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccennic acid in the rumen milk and meat.a lowered ratio of n-6n-3 fa in the diet is desirable due to its potential to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases in humans.this has stimulated research interest in decreasing the dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios of ruminant products.goats are gaining acceptance as a set up model for biomedical research and for surgical preparing and teaching.

in the current study the lack of dietary n-6n-3 ratios effects on the concentration of nh3-n in the rumen is consistent with those of kim et al.and toral et al.who observed that dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios did not affect nh3n concentration in the rumen of sheep.

in addition interspecies differences between ruminants concerning their lipid metabo- lism have been suggested.however there is a paucity of information on the effects of dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios on rumen microbial populations.fibrobacter succinogenes b. f ibrisolvens r. albus and r. flavefaciens are the most predominant cellulolytic species in the rumen and changes in their relative amounts could potentially affect ruminal fermentation.in the present study we observed that some bacterial populations in the rumen associated with bh of pufa were affected by dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios.

in line with our findings maia et al.reported that lna was more toxic to b. f ibrisolvens than la or cla sauggesting that increasing dietary n-6n-3 pufa ratios decreases the inhibitory effects of pufa on b. f ibrisolvens in the rumen.the proportion of r. albus and r. flavefaciens decreased as the n-6n-3 pufa ratios increased in the diet.
