In this paper we examine the potential of using a deep learning framework a convolutional neural network CNN for such a prediction.

To facilitate the CNN learning we explore the structure of abundance profiles by creating the phylogenetic tree and by designing a scheme to embed the tree to a matrix that retains the spatial relationship of nodes in the tree and their quantitative characteristics.

The proposed CNN framework is highly accurate achieving a 99.47 of accuracy based on the evaluation on a dataset 1967 samples of three phenotypes.

Our result demonstrated the feasibility and promising aspect of CNN in the classification of sample phenotype.INTRODUCTIONThe microbiome of the gut has been linked to many diseases including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel disease diabetes obesity cancer autoimmune diseases and various metabolic disorders 1.

However its classification accuracy is not as satisfactory compared with MLPNN and other models such as support vector machines and random forest.In this work we propose a novel framework using Convolutional Neural Network CNN which is a deep learning model based on the visual cortex and is more commonly used in image processing and speech recognition.

A CNN incorporates spatial information into the model and generates convolution layers with multiple feature maps.

Since microbial taxonomic abundance profiles imply structure information we take advantage of the CNN modeling approach to explore this structure by constructing a phylogenetic tree.

These matrices are input to our CNN model.

Our computational study shows the strong performance of the CNN and its ability to handle large datasets.MODELS AND METHODSIn this section we first describe how to represent the microbial taxonomic abundance data obtained from a sample on a phylogenetic tree as well as how to embed the tree into a matrix to preserve the spatial information of the phylogenetic tree.
