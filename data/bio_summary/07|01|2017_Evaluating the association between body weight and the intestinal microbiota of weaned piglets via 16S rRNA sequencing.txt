The overall compositions of the fecalmicrobiota of the lighter and heavier groups were represented as bar plots at the phylum level c and the genus level dComparison of the KEGG pathways of the fecal microbiota of the lighter and heavier pigletsWe compared the KEGG pathways predicted for the fecal mi- crobiota of the lighter and heavier piglets and found that various KEGG pathways were significantly differentially identified in the microbiota of the two groups Fig.

A two- sided Welch's t test was used to identify significant different metabolic pathways in the microbiota of the two groups with P  0.05 considered significant.ResultsDifferences in the alpha diversity of the intestinal microbiota of the lighter and heavier pigletsA total of 337534 mean value  18752 - 11675 16S rRNA gene sequence reads were generated with an average of 23067 -13261 reads per piglet in the lighter group and 14437 -8480 reads per piglet in the heavier group.ACE Chao1 observed OTUs PD Shannon index and Simpson index values were used as parameters of the alpha diversity of intestinal microbiota in this study Table .

The three dominant phyla detected in both groups were Firmicutes 48.42 in the lighter group and 53.59 in the heavier group Bacteroidetes 39.31 in the lighter group and 34.15 in the heavier group and Proteobacteria 5.25 in the lighter group and 4.23 in the heavier group.

The microbiota of the heavier group had a significant- ly higher Firmicutes level and FB ratio compared with that of the lighter group whereas a significantly higher Bacteroidetes level was observed in the microbiota of the lighter group consistent with the results observed in many previous studies Delzenne and Cani  Hildebrandt et al.

In the microbiota ofthe heavier group microbial degradation pathways for these toxic substances were more activated than they were in that of the lighter group which may have led to the body weight gain of the former group.In this study we compared the fecal microbiota of lighter and heavier piglets and their predicted metagenomes.

The diversity indices PD Shannon and Simpson were also higher for the heavier group than those for the lighter group although the differences were not significant.Differences in the microbial taxa representedin the intestinal microbiota of the lighter and heavier pigletsAt the 97 similarity level all of the OTUs observed were classified into 26 phyla and 258 genera Fig.

Therefore the body weight gain of the piglets with a microbiota that had a more activated NLR signaling pathway might be less than that of the piglets in whose microbiota pathway was less activated.We observed that three KEGG pathway- Bdioxin degradation Bxylene degradation and Bbenzoate degradation related genes belonging to the Bxenobiotics bio- degradation and metabolism pathway were significantly more abundant in the microbiota of the heavier group than those in that of the lighter group consistent with the results of other studies.

At the phylum level the microbiota of the lighter and heavier groups shared 24 phyla 92.31 with members of Acidobacteria and Armatimonadetes uniquely identi- fied in that of the lighter group and the heavier group respectively.

The Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio FB ratio was sig- nificantly higher in the heavier group than that in the ligh- ter group Table .At the genus level the levels of Anaerococcus Sediminibacterium and Butyrivibrio were significantly higher in the intestinal microbiota of the heavier group than those in that of the lighter group Fig.

The relationship between intestinal microbial diversity and body weight or obesity remains controversial issues.In this study we observed differences in the levels of sev- eral different phyla in the microbiota of the lighter and heavier groups.
