un- like WT mice G. It is important to note that under these 2o challenge conditions in Rag--cg-- mice we cannot distin- guish the requirement of Rag--cg---driven Pla2g1b expres- sion required for parasite killing from Rag--cg---dependent immune responses required for expulsion.Nevertheless these data demonstrate that PLA2g1B has direct anthelminthic properties distinct from type 2 immune re- sponses and that PLA2g1B is essential for intestinal helminth clearance during 2oH.p.

To test the infectivity and viabilityof PLA2g1B-treated L3 larvae we infected mice with PLA2g1B-treated L3 larvae and found that PLA2g1B-treated L3 larvae could embed into the intestinal wall  B However significantly fewer treated larvae developed into adulthood C impacting egg recovery in the feces although failing to reach statis- tical significance Figure S5C.

L3 larvae we treated larvae for 24 hr with PLA2g1B or control buffer and subjected the treated larvae to scanning electron micro- scopy SEM and lipid composition analysis using liquid chroma- tography-mass spectrometry LC-MS.

requires both PLA2g1B-mediated effects on L3 larvae and immune-mediated expulsion mechanisms.The requirement for a combined functional immune compart- ment alongside direct PLA2g1B-mediated action was confirmed by infecting Rag--cg-- mice with PLA2g1B-treated larvae.

Mice were secondary 2o challenge infected on day 35 or day 56 with 200 L3 infective H. polygyrus larvae p.o.. H. polygyrus worms were counted in the wall of the intestine at day 5 post infection and luminal worms were counted 14 days-post 1o or 2o infection.Nippostrongylus brasiliensisMice were infected with 350 L3 infective N. brasiliensis larvae s.c. on day 0.

C57BL6 Pla2g1b--  4get  Rag--cg-- and Rag2-- mice were bred and maintained at The Francis Crick Institute.

Briefly H. polygyrus adult worms two L4 larvae or 100 L3 larvae were homogenized using a motorised pestle in 110 mL of PBS and 110 mL of CellTiter-Glor Reagent.

PLA2g1B-mediated effects on L3 larvae were dependent on the catalytic activity of PLA2g1B as the PLA2 irreversible inhibitor manoalide completely abrogated the protective effect of PLA2g1B treat- ment in vitro Figure S5D.The protective effect of PLA2g1B-treated L3 larvae during a 1o infection did not recapitulate the full killing expulsion and clearance of worms observed during 2o H.p.

Upon 1o infection Rag--cg-- mice fail to expel PLA2g1B- treated larvae unlike WT mice F These data highlight the clear requirement of a competent immune compartment for parasite expulsion.

This observation was reinforced when Rag--cg-- mice that were infected drug cured and chal- lenged with PLA2g1B-treated L3 larvae failed to expel H.p.
