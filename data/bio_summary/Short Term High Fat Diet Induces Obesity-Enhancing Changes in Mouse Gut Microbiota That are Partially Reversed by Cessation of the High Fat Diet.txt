It was plausible that a 2-week diet intervention in the present study might not be long enough to fully restore the gut microbiota pattern that was altered by HFD.Studies in human gut microbiota continue to advance ourunderstanding on the correlation of gut microbiota compo- sition with chronic disorders such as obesity inflamma- tory bowel disease and cancer.

In the present study we exam- ined changes in the cecum and colon mucosal microbiota patterns by using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology as well as measured body weight gain and metabolic parameters in mice after a short period of HFD feeding 5 weeks followed by a low-fat diet intervention 2 weeks.Materials and MethodsAnimal ModelMale C57BL6J mice 6 weeks old were fed the following diets for 7 weeks 1 low fat control diet with 10 kcal fat Research Diets Inc. D12450B 2 high-fat diet HFD with 60 kcal fat Research Diets Inc. D12492 or 3 5-week HFD followed by 2-week low fat control diet HFD Control.

These results suggest that short-term high fat diet with- drawal can restore metabolic changes and prevent excess body weight gain however long-term dietary intervention may be required to optimize the restoration of gut micro- biota in mouse.Keywords Dietary fat intervention  High fat diet  Gut microbiota  MucosaAbbreviationsANOVAAnalysis of varianceGLMGeneral linear modelsHFDHigh fat dietKEGGKyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomesOTUOperational taxonomic unitsPCoAPrincipal coordinate analysis PERMANOVAPermutational multivariate analysis ofvariancePICRUStPhylogenetic investigation of communi-ties by reconstruction of unobserved statesQIIMEQuantitative insights into microbial ecologySTAMPStatistical analysis of metagenomicprofilesIntroductionObesity continues to be a global epidemic which pre- disposes obese people to a number of metabolic diseases including type-2 diabetes mellitus cardiovascular dis- ease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease -.

The microbial community especially the mucus-degrading bacteria is influenced by high fat diet HFD which in turn increases the degradation of the outer mucus layer in the gut .It has been reported that prolonged high fat consump- tion 8-24 weeks alters the composition and functional- ity of the gut microbiota in mice      .

The HFD Control diet partially restored the diversity and composition of microbiota in the cecum to the pattern observed in mice fed a control diet.
