unfortunately the authors did not determine microbiota composition so it is not possible to discern whether the beneficial effect arose only from the provision of nutrients to intestinal epithelial cells or whether it was co-associated with a shift in microbiota composition.pn and proprebiotic treatmentwe recently showed that the microbiota of adult sbs patients dependent on total parenteral nutrition is depleted of anaerobic butyrate producers and that the amount of scfa particularly propionate and butyrate in luminal content is accordingly very low .

nevertheless this innovative study points out an unexpected aspect of pn namely the interplay of the gut microbiota and lipid components of the nutrition mixture.patients with small intestinal resections fed vs. enterally deprived portions of the intestinethe common denominator for all of the above therapeutic or experimental settings is the absence of enteral nutrition which leaves the intestinal microbiota in a state of acute nutrient withdrawal.

the disruption of enterohepatic circulation may result in disturbed bile acid metabolism and a preference for microbiota that are tolerant to bile acids.adult sbs patients microbiota compositionoriginal studies that describe the microbiome in sbs patients are remarkably consistent in their findings.

the healthy gut microbiota provides its host with a physical barrier to incoming pathogens and stimulates it to produce various antimicrobial compounds .the microbiota and tlr signallingthe loss of diversity associated with prolonged pn administration has several adverse impacts on immune functions.

however the facts we do have at our disposal namely the shift in microbiota composition and the increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine production at least suggest a similar scenario.the microbiota and paneth cellspaneth cells are important components of mucosal immunity.

however fxr and tgr5 have different affinities to individual bas as fxr is activated by cdca  dca  lca  ca and tgr5 is activated by lca  dca  cdca  ca .interplay between bile acids and the gut microbiotabecause the transformation of bas is solely dependent on the gut microbiota the extent of ba receptor activation is largely dependent on microbiota composition .

taken together these data advocate intravenous scfa particularly butyrate supplementation as a new option for the treatment of pn-associated intestinal complications.role of the microbiota in pnald developmentin the previous sections we discussed the essential role of the gut microbiota in the maintenance of homeostasis in the intestinal environment and the adverse effects of dysbiosis figure .

suppression of the intestinal microbiota with broad-spectrum antibiotics and ablation of tlr4 signalling in tlr4 mutant mice prevented pnald development which strongly suggests the role of the microbiota in its etiopathogenesis.

therapeutic strategies focus on microbiota composition itself through the targeted delivery of beneficial microbiota products or by supplementation with immunomodulators.

finally we provide an overview of recent advances in the therapeutic utilisation of pro- and prebiotics for the mitigation of pn-associated liver complications.keywords parenteral nutrition microbiota pnald intestinal permeability gut-associated immune system bile acids fxr signalling preprobioticsintroductionparenteral nutrition pn provides life-saving nutritional support in situations where caloric supply via the enteral route is either not possible or cannot cover the necessary needs of the organism e.g.

the gut microbiota is the most abundant cohort of antigen-presenting cells.

based on the above facts it is conceivable that the radical alteration of gut microbiome composition and function as a result of switching to total parenteral nutrition could lead to detrimental effects on the intestine and significantly contribute to pnald development.pn and the gut microbiotadata on the gut microbiota in the context of pn have been obtained under three different group settings animal models mouse rat piglet neonate babies most of them premature and adult patients who have lost a substantial portion of functional gut tissue and cannot feed themselves via the enteral route.

as expected the gut microbial composition of pn-dependent piglets differed from those fed with sow milk but the microbiota further clustered according to o-3 or o-6 pufa content in the nutrition mixture.

general adaptations following intestinal resection include compensatory hyperphagia mucosal remodelling of the remaining part of the intestine and major modifications of the microbiota .

the common feature of the sbs microbiota is significantly reduced a-diversity when compared with healthy controls  which positively correlates with remaining small bowel length  and pn dependence duration .
