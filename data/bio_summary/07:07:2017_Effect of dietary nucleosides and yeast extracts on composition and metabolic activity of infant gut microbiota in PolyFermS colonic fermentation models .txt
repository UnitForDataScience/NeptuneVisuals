All F1 reactors were operated at conditions prevailing in the infant proximal colon and were fed with a medium mimicking the chyme entering the colon of a formula-fed infant Table S1 Supporting Information.F2 was set up to mimic infant proximal and distal colon con- ditions Fig.

Dagger indicates that abundance of bacterial group in proximal and distal colon reactors is significantly different from the control period.A-DTreatments in proximal and distal colon reactors with different capital letters within the same column are significantly different.were only detected in F1 while isovalerate was only present in F2 Tables .Microbial composition in donor feces and inoculum reactors of PolyFermS modelsThe microbial community composition and diversity of donor feces and inoculum reactor effluents was investigated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing Table S3 Supporting Information.In donor feces of F1 the phyla Firmicutes 17 Bacteroidetes 50 and Actinobacteria 29 contributed the majority ofreads while Proteobacteria 4 was present in low abundance Fig.

F1 was set to mimic the microbiota of the proximal colon segment of a healthy formula-fed infant while F2 was designed to mimic enteropathogen-contaminated microbiota of the proximal and distal colon segments of an infant Fig.

An inoculum reactor inoculated with immobi- lized fecal microbiota of a healthy infant was used to continu- ously inoculate 5 vv two reactors mounted in parallel run at proximal colon conditions proximal colon reactor that were each attached to second reactors run at distal colon conditions distal colon reactor Fig.

However no data exist on the impact of dietary NS or NT on infant gut mi- crobiota contaminated with enteropathogens though intesti- nal pathogen contamination is a worldwide phenomenon of in- fants living in poor hygienic conditions Baltazar Tiglao and Tempongko .We therefore aimed to investigate how NS and NT addition impacts the composition and metabolic activity of healthy and enteropathogen-contaminated infant gut microbiota using modeling in the PolyFermS platform Zihler Berner et al.

As the outcome of nutritional supplementation on gut microbiota can depend on the health status of the host we tested NT in two different PolyFermS in- testinal fermentation models mimicking a healthy infant gut F1 and an infant gut artificially contaminated with pathogens F2.

Distal colon reactors 420 mL were fed 100 with proximal colon re- actor effluent at a flow rate of 35 mL h-1 for a mean retention time of 12 h. All reactors were operated at 37C and 120 rpm un- der anaerobic conditions by continually flushing the headspace of all reactors and medium bottles with CO2.

Model 1 was inoculated with im- mobilized fecal microbiota of a 6-month formula-fed healthy infant while model 2 was inoculated with immobilized fecal microbiota of a 8-month formula-fed healthy infant that was ar- tificially contaminated with a mix of enteropathogens to mimic gut microbiota of an infant living in rural areas of Kenya Jaeggi et al.

Inter- estingly both Salmonella and C. difficile declined following re- supplementation with NS100 while only Salmonella decreased to a lesser extent with SYE7.5 suggesting that NT addition may decrease enteropathogen colonization.In conclusion our findings using advanced PolyFermS in vitro continuous intestinal fermentation models give first in- sights into the effects of dietary NS and YE containing different NT levels on the taxonomic and functional profiles of healthy and pathogen-contaminated infant gut microbiota.
