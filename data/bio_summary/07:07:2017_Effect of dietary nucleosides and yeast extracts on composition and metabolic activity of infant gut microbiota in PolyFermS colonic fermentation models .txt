in the proximal colon reactor seed categories 'carbohydrates' and 'protein metabolism' were more abundant than in distal colon reactors whereas in distal colon reactors transcripts allocated to 'stress response' were increased table s6 supporting infor- mation.figure 4. total scfa formation in dependence of equivalent nt content.

a. all f1 reactors were operated at conditions prevailing in the infant proximal colon and were fed with a medium mimicking the chyme entering the colon of a formula-fed infant table s1 supporting information.f2 was set up to mimic infant proximal and distal colon con- ditions fig.

b. an inoculum reactor inoculated with immobi- lized fecal microbiota of a healthy infant was used to continu- ously inoculate 5 vv two reactors mounted in parallel run at proximal colon conditions proximal colon reactor that were each attached to second reactors run at distal colon conditions distal colon reactor fig.

distal colon reactors 420 ml were fed 100 with proximal colon re- actor effluent at a flow rate of 35 ml h-1 for a mean retention time of 12 h. all reactors were operated at 37c and 120 rpm un- der anaerobic conditions by continually flushing the headspace of all reactors and medium bottles with co2.

subsystems overrepresented in test reactors after addition of ye are shown with a negative value.sye7.5 supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of seed categories 'nucleosides and nucleotides' 'sulfur metabolism' and 'iron acquisition and metabolism' while the relative abundance of the category 'cofactors vita- mins prosthetic groups pigments' was reduced in treated prox- imal and distal colon reactors compared to the control period fig.

after 5 days the inoculum reactor was connected to the control and test reactors in f1 and to each one of the proximal colon reactor in f2 which was in se- ries with a distal colon reactor.

a mean retention time of 6 h was maintained in control and test reactors of f1 and in proximal colon reactor of f2.

f1 was set to mimic the microbiota of the proximal colon segment of a healthy formula-fed infant while f2 was designed to mimic enteropathogen-contaminated microbiota of the proximal and distal colon segments of an infant fig.

the log gene copies of c. difficile c. perfringens and epec were similar in proximal and distal colon reactors while s. typhimuriuminva copies were 1 log unit higher in distal colon than inproximal colon reactor.the total and individual scfa concentrations recorded in in- oculum reactor and reactor of f1 showed a slight and steady in- crease during the first ca.

a. compared to donor feces the relative abundance of firmicutes and fusobacteria in the reactors was more than 2-fold higher while the abundance of bacteroidetes was re- duced.

sye7.5 supplementation decreased the rel- ative abundance of proteobacteria transcripts in proximal and distal colon reactor compared to the control period confirming the decline in relative abundance observed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr.

the relative abundance of bacteroidetes transcripts was enhanced after addition of sye7.5 due to an increase of prevotellaceae in particular in both in proximal and distal colon reactors which was also observed with 16s rrna gene sequencing.

compared to the control supplementation with ns100 increased the relative abundance of bifidobacteriaceae transcripts and resulted in a decrease of erysipelotrichaceae tran- scripts in both proximal colon reactors.
