however the interruption of this healthy interaction with an imbalance in the normal bacterial ecology in the gut defined as intestinal dysbiosis may contribute to the development of metabolic and chronic inflammatory dis eases such as t2d -.some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the influ ence of the gut microbiota on insulin resistance and t2d such as bacterial translocation metabolic endotoxemia defective secretion of incretins and decreased butyrate concentrations  .

however butyrateproducing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii with antiinflammatory effects were decreased in t2d patients .based on studies showing the importance of resilience of the intestinal microbiota in human health and studies showing that intestinal dysbiosis may be strongly associated with gut epithe lial barrier disruption bacterial translocation and metabolic endotoxemia -  we hypothesized that the abundance of gramnegative bacteria is greater in the feces of t2d patients and positively correlated with the plasma levels of proinflam matory cytokines and lps.

here we investigated the intestinal dysbiosis in brazilian t2d patients and correlated these data with systemic inflammatory cytokines lps concentrations and with clinical data.the adult healthy gut microbiota is dominated by micro organisms belonging to the firmicutes grampositive and bacteroidetes gramnegative phyla .

lps are endotoxins present in the cell wall of gramnegative bacteria and these molecules are pri marily responsible for the endotoxemia observed in metabolic disorders .changes in gramnegative bacteria concentrations in the gut combined with increased intestinal permeability could promote lps escape into the bloodstream and induce systemic inflammation .

we observed significant differences p  0.01 in the microbiota composition beta-diversity between patients and controls suggesting intestinal dysbiosis in brazilian t2d patients.

significance was set at p  0.05.observed correlations between the proinflammatory ifng with gramnegatives bacteroides and prevotella species also support ing our hypothesis.one of the mechanisms proposed to explain the imbalance in the intestinal microbiota the altered regulation of fat stor age and the development of metabolic diseases is the metabolic endotoxemia .

t2d development involves genetic and environmental factors and recent reports have implicated the gut microbiota in the regulation of glu cose and lipid metabolism  .

consistently some studies correlate important perturbations in the gut microbiota composition with systemic inflammation which is observed in metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance obesity and t2d -.in humans more than a trillion of microorganisms primar ily bacteria colonize the oralgastrointestinal tract and reside in the distal portion of the intestine  .

the gut microbiota contributes to many of the host physiological processes and in turn the host offers niche and nutrients for the survival of these microbes -.
