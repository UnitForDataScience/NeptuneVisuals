The prevalent phyla in patients were Bacteroidetes patient reads P  47.97 control reads C  46.32 and Firmicutes P  43.77 C  43.92 the prevalent classes were Bacteroidia P  44.40 C  45.73 and Clostridia P  35.31 C  34.39 the prevalent orders were Bacteroidales P  44.41 C  45.73 and Clostridiales P  35.31 C  34.39 and the prevalent families were Bacteroidaceae P  21.09 C  27.19 Ruminococcaceae P  19.05 C  17.99 Prevotellaceae P  17.11 C  8.41 and Lachnospiraceae P  11.00 C  12.43 .

Significant correlations among the proinflammatory cytokine IFNg and relative abundan ces of Firmicutes P  0.007 r  0.75 Clostridia P  0.016r  0.69 Bacteroides P  0.014 r  -0.70 and Prevotella P  0.021 r  0.66 were observed .

Prevalent phyla a classes B orders c families D genera e and species F. Bars represent the reads percentages found in metagenomic analyses.significant difference P  0.009 in the LPS concentration in plasma from T2D patients mean - SEM 13.54 - 0.86 ngmL and controls 16.98 - 0.79 ngmL .An inverse correlation between the LPS concentration in theplasma of patients and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria P  0.040 r  -0.58 was observed.

vulgatus P  13 C  18 Bacteroides rodentium P  9 C  13 and Bacteroides xylanisolvens P  8 C  6 .To identify correlations between intestinal microbiota com position and clinical data we examined the correlations among IMC fasting blood glucose and HbA1C with relative abundances of bacterial groups detected in the feces of T2D patients.

LPS are endotoxins present in the cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria and these molecules are pri marily responsible for the endotoxemia observed in metabolic disorders .Changes in Gramnegative bacteria concentrations in the gut combined with increased intestinal permeability could promote LPS escape into the bloodstream and induce systemic inflammation .

The prevalent genera in T2D patients were Bacteroides P  21.09 C  27.19 and Prevotella P  14.07 C  7.03.

The proinflammatory interleukin-6 IL-6 was significantly increased P  0.05 in patients' plasma and LPS levels were decreased.

Furthermore a positive correlation between Negativicutes reads with IL6 P  0.037 r  0.59 was observed .lPs Plasma concentrations Were Different between Patients and controlsTo evaluate the metabolic endotoxemia in the plasma of T2D patients we quantified LPS using an ELISA.

Moreover a positive correlation was observed between LPS and Prevotella reads P  0.041 r  0.58 .

However the interruption of this healthy interaction with an imbalance in the normal bacterial ecology in the gut defined as intestinal dysbiosis may contribute to the development of metabolic and chronic inflammatory dis eases such as T2D -.Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the influ ence of the gut microbiota on insulin resistance and T2D such as bacterial translocation metabolic endotoxemia defective secretion of incretins and decreased butyrate concentrations  .
