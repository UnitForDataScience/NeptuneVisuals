The Carbohydrate-Active enZymes CAZy and laccases and related multicopper oxidases MCOs engi- neering database LccED were used to fully explore the large repertoire of microbes and putative genes involved in the plant polysaccharide and lignin decomposition within the Caatinga soil metagenome and in several reported metagenomic datasets from different ecological niches.Overall this work provides a comprehensive scanning of the lignocellulose digestion capabilities of the microbiota in a natu- ral ecosystem with high biomass turnover opening up possibil- ities for further ecological and biotechnological studies aiming to unveil the mechanism by which resident soil microbial com- munities synergistically degrade the plant biomass.MATERIAL AND METHODSSampling and DNA extractionBulk soil samples were collected from Caatinga biome of semi- arid region of northeast Brazil 0850I01.6IS4233I13.3IW Serra da Capivara National Park Piaui' State during the rainy season on May 2011.

The best correlations of GH profiles were observed between Caatinga soil and other soil environmentsR2  0.758 and R2  0.668 with farm soil and soil-contactingsugarcane bagasse respectively which is not surprising con- sidering the similar habitat functions consistent with dendro- gram plot Fig.

Hence in this study high-throughput metagenomic sequencing approach was applied to unravel for the first time i the phylogenetic com- position and genetic potential for mining novel lignocellulose- degrading enzymes from a metagenomic library of Caatinga soil and ii the biodegradative capacity of the individual mem- bers of Caatinga soil microbial community for utilizing plantbiomass substrates.

Contigs an- notation by the MG-RAST pipeline allowed the identification of 532 280 protein features 63.6 of predicted proteins includ- ing 1 511 rRNA genes which corresponded to 0.18 of the to- tal sequences obtained see Table for the full information on metagenomic annotation.Taxonomic and functional assignment of Caatinga soil metagenomic libraryTo fully explore the phylogenetic diversity in the large-insert metagenomic library derived from the semiarid soil of Caatinga biome the taxonomic and functional classification of reads were performed before assembly see workflow--Fig.

The profile of oligosaccharide-degrading enzymes from the Caatinga soil metagenome 17 was also most similar to the farm soil 14 and soil-contacting sugarcane bagasse 16.5 showing higher relative abundance of GH3 which include large range of b- glucosidases N-acetylglucosaminidases NagZs b-xylosidases and a-arabinofuranosidases Table .

Thus analysis performed in this study showed for the first time that a metagenomic fosmid library from this exclusively Brazilian biome can offer a wealthy source for the discovery of new enzymes with potential for pro- ducing biofuels from plant biomass conversion.Bacterial contribution for lignocellulose-degrading genes in the Caatinga soil metagenomeIn an attempt to investigate the role of specific microbes in the lignocellulose decomposition process from Caatinga soil micro- biome ORFs filtered from the bacterial genera were recorded separately from the repertoire of CAZymes.
