however examined adult liver tissue gene expression so our finding of fewer overall sex-biased genes but a larger chromosome 19 bias suggests that sex-biased gene expression in undifferentiated larval stickleback guts most likely reflects lack of dosage com- pensation for X and Y-specific gene expression.Ward clustering of normalized expression values for a subset of 314 genes on chromosome 19--located between 6 and 12 Mb and corresponding to high sex-biased gene ex- pression according to -- revealed two major clusters of individuals that corresponded perfectly with our PCR-based sex genotypes supplementary fig.

In contrast to the effects of the microbiota and con- sistent with the multivariate transcriptome analysis see above influences of host population on gene-wise expression patterns in the gut were much more extensive we identified 3451 genes differentially expressed between OC and FW fish nearly 22 of the annotated genes expressed at appreciable levels in the gut see supplementary table S5 Supplementary Material online.To identify known gene regulatory pathways responsive to the microbiota in stickleback we tested whether certain KEGG pathways were enriched for stickleback orthologs with high or low CV-GF log2 fold changes.

This cross-species pattern suggests a directional bias toward positive as opposed to negative microbe-induced gene regulation in fish hosts.Microbe-Associated Transcriptional Responses of Innate Immunity Pathways and NLRC3-like NOD-like Receptors Depend on the Genetic Background of the HostConsidering global multivariate patterns of gene expression the interaction between host population and microbiota treat- ment was not statistically significant  perMANOVA F180 1.28 P  0.21 meaning transcriptome disparity be- tween CV and GF fish did not differ by host population.

Assuming these differences in the gut microbiota are at least in part explained by genetic variation which has been demonstrated in other vertebrate hosts      widespread evolved differences in digestive tract gene expression among populations are a potential mechanism connecting host genotype to microbial phenotype in stickleback.Sources of Global Transcriptional Variation in the Gut Highlight Considerations for Future Host-Microbe Systems ResearchGiven our conclusion that substantial divergence in host tran- scription within the digestive tract can evolve on relatively short timescales studies of host-microbe interactions in ge- netically heterogeneous host species deserve special consider- ation.

This suggests that neither the microbiota treatment nor population-specific sensitivity to a rearing salinity of 4 gL affected normal devel- opment in our experiment.To measure the relative contributions of the microbiota and host genotype to gene expression we generated RNA-seq data from 84 larval stickleback guts collected from families of freshwater and oceanic fish reared in the presence or ab- sence of microbes .

By incorporating population- and family-level genetic variation as well as hous- ing environment replicates into our experimental design we were able to contrast the relative influence of these factors with that of the microbiota on gene expression in the gut putting into context the potential significance of host genetic variation in human-microbe interactions.Microbe-Sensitive Gene Expression Patterns in Stickleback Align with Inferences from Other Vertebrate Host- Microbe Model SystemsThe first major objective of our study was to characterize the transcriptional response of larval stickleback hosts to the gut microbiota.

We then fit a linear model for each gene including the fixed effects of factor levels for host pop- ulation host family nested within host population sex and microbiota treatment using the limma lmFit function.

In addition the recent develop- ment of a protocol to generate gnotobiotic individuals  and identification of significantvariation in the gut microbiota among stickleback populations in the wild  places the stickleback model in a rare position to address systems-level questions about host genetic variation and host-microbe relationships.Global transcriptional profiles offer comprehensive system- atic insights into multi-level processes such as microbe-sensi- tive gene regulatory cascades  and are therefore useful for evaluating the relative contributions of host and environmental factors to variation in the behavior of gene regulatory networks.

Given the preponderance of these interactions we hypothesized that effects of the microbiota on gene expression in the developing gut--an important aspect of host biology--would be pervasive and that these effects would be both comparable in magnitude to and contingent on effects of the host genetic background.

To evaluate the effects of the microbiota host genotype and their interaction on gene expression in the gut of a genetically diverse gnotobiotic host model the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus we compared RNA-seq data among 84 larval fish.
