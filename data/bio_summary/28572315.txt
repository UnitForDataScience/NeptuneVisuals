we report here for the first time six metagenomes of royal jelly pollen and different types of honey from wild and cultivated lavender chestnut and fir honeydew.

four metagenomes of epiphytic and endophytic microbiota of lavender and rose flowers are also re- ported.hile the health benefits of beehive products are widely acknowledged their associated microbiota remain very little known.

metagenomic shotgun sequencing allowed for describing the microbiota of beehive- related products such as honey from wild and cultivated lavender chestnut and fir honeydew royal jelly and pollen.

we also described the epiphytic and endophyticmicrobiota of rose and lavender flowers.all samples were taken from the mountains of the national park of mercantour located north of la bollene vesubie france except one from a culture of lavendula latifolia x officinalis from the plateau of valensole located south of the national park of mercantour and one from fir abies alba honeydew honey from the vosges mountains allarmont france.

flowers of wild lavender lavandula angustifolia were sampled in the mountains of la bollene vesubie while flowers of rosa x damascena were from la pallud-sur-verdon france.

dna of epiphytic microbiota from lavender and rose flowers were extracted by incubating flowers in pbs 1x 0.15 tween 20 with shaking 400 rpm for 10 min followed by a 5-min sonication step shaking for 10 min 400 rpm prior to prefiltration and filtration on a 0.22-um sterile filter millipore germany.
