Thus these results suggest that the BAF is effec- tive for NHth4 -N removal even under low temperature and suitable as a pretreatment unit for reducing ammonia load for the follow-up process in DWTPs.Long-term removal of NO-2 -NComparing to the high while stable removal efficiency of NHth4 -N the removal efficiency of NO-2 -N changed dramatically with sea- sonal water temperature variation .

The water that used in backwashing procedure had turbidity lower than 0.1 NTU and contained no any disinfectants.Raw water quality and analytical methodsThe raw water in this study came from a natural river which is the source water of the DWTP located in Jiaxing Southeast China.

The dynamic change both of water temperature solid line and NHth4 -N A NO-2 -N B NO-3 -N D and DO C were plotted.

The effluent of NO-2 -N remained in alow level with the average value of 0.006 mgL in summer which is way below the limit of the Standards for Drinking Water Quality 1 mgL NO-2 -N GB5749-2006 in China and the EU regulations of drinking water directive 0.1 mgL Council Directive 9883EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human con- sumption.

The removal effi- ciencies shown in also exhibited the differential of the BAF performance in different seasons.Long-term removal of NHth4 -NThe removal efficiency of NHth4 -N was stable over the testing period despite the influent values fluctuated frequently e. The average removal efficiency of NHth4-N was 83.11 in the whole year .

These results suggested a low temperature- induced increase of NHth4 -N removal efficiency in the BAF.The influent concentration of NHth4 -N varied from 1.93 to 2.9 mg L  and the higher level appeared in autumn winter and early spring of which the water temperature was less than 20 oC.

The NHth4 -N removal efficiency was up to 77.5 under a low water temperature range of 5.1 oCe8.1 oC.

The removal efficiency of NO-2 -N black solid bar showed a variation matched the water temperature changes B and became negative when temperature below 7 oC which was not plotted.

Concerning the NHth4 -N removal efficiency of 77.52 at 5 oC we speculated that it was psychrophilic AOB that contributed to the performance of NHth4 -N removal in winter.Microorganisms are classified into psychrophilic bacteria with cardinal temperature less than 15 oC upper limit of 20 oC   mesophilic bacteria with optimal growth temperature be- tween 20 and 40 oC and psychrotolerant bacteria that can overlap any adjacent thermal groups.
