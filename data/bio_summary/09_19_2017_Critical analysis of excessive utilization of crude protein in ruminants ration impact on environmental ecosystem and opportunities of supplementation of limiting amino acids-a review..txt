Analysis of the effects of supple- mentation of rumen-protected AA in milk production or con- tents depends on the availability of concentration of Met and Lys in the small intestine Socha and Schwab  andTable 1Supplemented levels of rumen protected amino acids methionine and lysine their effects on milk production fat and milk protein ReferenceDietsMilk yield kgdayMilk fat kgdayMilk protein kgdaySupplemented rumen protected amino acids in rationSupplementaddition of these AA in ruminant ration increases the flow of AA at the small intestine and raise the percentage of milk production and milk contents Schwab et al.

and Ferla and Patrick .Meta-analysis on low CP diet plus rumen-protected AA and effect on dairy cowsIt is a good approach to reduce CP concentration with supple- mentation of rumen-protected AA without decline of milk performance and milk contents of dairy cows and decreasingthe environmental pollution burden by ruminant industry Leonardi et al.

In ruminant ration the balance of AA is the most significant factor compared with RDP in order to maintain milk production milk protein yield and N utili- zation in dairy cow Noftsger and St-Pierre  Laudadio and Tufarelli .

Further some dietary-soluble proteins cannot be degraded in the rumen and escaped to increase the source and absorption of AA in the small intestine and in- crease milk production and milk contents of dairy cows Choi et al.

Many proteins are deficient in essential AA rations which formulat- ed form those protein sources for medium or high yielding dairy cow are very low in Met quantity and did not maintain the requirements of milk production and lean tissue growth.

Trend of increasing CP in dairy cow diets not only increase milk production but also increase surge of ruminal NH3 production with blood urea N and subsequently increas- ing the losses of urinary N Castillo et al.

The main goal of feeding RDP is to provide a sufficient quantity of microbial protein to increase AA absorption in the small intestine of animals but rumen-undegradable AA must be supplemented to high-producing cow rations in order to increase the flow of AA in the small intestine to maintain balance of animal performance Leonardi et al.

The ruminal N losses play a major role in the metabolic losses as indigestible microbial N also reduces the absorption of AA in milk protein approximately 72 of urinary N excretion was recorded in dairy cow Tamminga .

Also N excretion was signifi- cantly low when feeding diets are with low CP during production round of dairy cow decreasing 1 CP in the diet and reducing 8 to 10 N excretion and when the CP level decreased up to 3 to 4 with supplementation of limiting AA giving up good developmental performance which reduces N excretion up to 30 Cole et al.
