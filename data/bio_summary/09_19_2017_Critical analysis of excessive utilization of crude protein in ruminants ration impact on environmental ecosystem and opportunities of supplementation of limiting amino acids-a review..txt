Analysis of the effects of supple- mentation of rumen-protected AA in milk production or con- tents depends on the availability of concentration of Met and Lys in the small intestine Socha and Schwab  andTable 1Supplemented levels of rumen protected amino acids methionine and lysine their effects on milk production fat and milk protein ReferenceDietsMilk yield kgdayMilk fat kgdayMilk protein kgdaySupplemented rumen protected amino acids in rationSupplementaddition of these AA in ruminant ration increases the flow of AA at the small intestine and raise the percentage of milk production and milk contents Schwab et al.

and Ferla and Patrick .Meta-analysis on low CP diet plus rumen-protected AA and effect on dairy cowsIt is a good approach to reduce CP concentration with supple- mentation of rumen-protected AA without decline of milk performance and milk contents of dairy cows and decreasingthe environmental pollution burden by ruminant industry Leonardi et al.

Further some dietary-soluble proteins cannot be degraded in the rumen and escaped to increase the source and absorption of AA in the small intestine and in- crease milk production and milk contents of dairy cows Choi et al.

In ruminant ration the balance of AA is the most significant factor compared with RDP in order to maintain milk production milk protein yield and N utili- zation in dairy cow Noftsger and St-Pierre  Laudadio and Tufarelli .

Trend of increasing CP in dairy cow diets not only increase milk production but also increase surge of ruminal NH3 production with blood urea N and subsequently increas- ing the losses of urinary N Castillo et al.

The most effective method is to increase the concentration of rumen-protected Met for dairy cows at the early lactation stage in order to increase milk and milk protein yield Davidson et al.

Furthermore supplementation of Met plus Lys to dairy cows increased the milk production milkprotein yield Armentano et al.
