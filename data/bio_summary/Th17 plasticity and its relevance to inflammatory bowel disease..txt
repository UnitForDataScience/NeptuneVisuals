Tumour Necrosis Factor a TNFa is a key inflammatory mediator produced by M4 and other immune cells and is responsible for a diverse range of signalling events within immune and non-immune cells leading to accelerating inflammation.Table 2List of Ikaros family influencing T cell development and plasticity.Environmental cues towards Th17 plasticityThe gut microbiotaSince transdifferentiation between Treg and Th17 is diminished in germ-free conditions the microbiota is considered a major player in the generation of this population in the gut e. Clostridia species in particular are recognised for their contribution to gut homeostasis through T cell plasticity.

Interest- ingly a lineage marker of progenitor Th17 cells CD161 is still sus- tained in Th1 cells converted from Th17 in human  and murine models  of IBD and serves as evidence for the trans- differentiation of Th17 cells into Th1 cells since the conventional Th1 population does not express CD161.Treg-Th17 transdifferentiationGut-resident FoxP3th CD4th Treg cells demonstrate a unique phenotype which is restricted by antigen-specificity against intes- tinal components comprised of harmless dietary antigens and gut microbiota .

This cytokine milieu can be a matrix of initiators of T cell transdifferentiation or plasticity.Heterogeneity of Th17In response to the surrounding microenvironment Th17 cells can secrete IFN-g and IL-22 and express FoxP3 in addition to the canonical Th17 cytokines e.g.

In addition Th17 cells occasionally express FoxP3 to maintain immune cell suppression for homeo- static status of the gut e. This could explain the greater plasticity of Th17 cells compared to other T cell classes when exposed to a change in cytokine milieu.

Interestingly in vitro administration of the active form of vitamin D to circulating CD3th T cells results in a decrease in IFN-g secreting CD8th Tc1 regardless of illness and this observation is accompanied by a decrease in IFN-gth IL-17th CD8th T cells .Influence of Ikaros family in Th17 plasticityMembers of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcriptionproposed that expression of Helios may specifically identify nTreg allowing specific tracking of Treg from different origins in health and disease  although this remains uncertain e. None- theless Heliosth and Helios- subsets may differ in surface markers and cytokines and their suppressive nature e.Aiolos IKZF3Fig.

Therefore vitB3 may induce Treg and Tr-1 cells and control Th17 plasticity along with SCFA activity by increasing expression of GPR109A.Tryptophan-IDO-AhR axesAn essential amino acid tryptophan is considered to play a unique role in the T cell plasticity via the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR which is a ligand activated transcription factor that has ef- fects upon T helper cell differentiation.

Those cytokines can induce tolerogenic and regulatory populations such as FoxP3th regulatory T cells Treg FoxP3- TGF-bth type 1 regulatory T Tr-1 cells and IFNg- IL-17- IL-22th Th22 cells while suppressing effector T cell Teff development .

Furthermore Th17 cells and Treg are implicated in both CD and UC with Th17 cells thought to play a pathogenic role whereas Treg play a crucial anti- inflammatory and immunoregulatory role .

For example IL-12 and IL- 23 can enhance T-bet and promote a switch to a Th1 phenotype or IL-17th IFNgth cells e whilst IL-4 can increase GATA3 and induce IL-4 expression in Th17 cells  and anti-TNF-a via cMaf and Aiolos could drive IL-10 expression in Th17 cells .
