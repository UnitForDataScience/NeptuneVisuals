Interest- ingly a lineage marker of progenitor Th17 cells CD161 is still sus- tained in Th1 cells converted from Th17 in human  and murine models  of IBD and serves as evidence for the trans- differentiation of Th17 cells into Th1 cells since the conventional Th1 population does not express CD161.Treg-Th17 transdifferentiationGut-resident FoxP3th CD4th Treg cells demonstrate a unique phenotype which is restricted by antigen-specificity against intes- tinal components comprised of harmless dietary antigens and gut microbiota .

Furthermore Th17 cells and Treg are implicated in both CD and UC with Th17 cells thought to play a pathogenic role whereas Treg play a crucial anti- inflammatory and immunoregulatory role .

This cytokine milieu can be a matrix of initiators of T cell transdifferentiation or plasticity.Heterogeneity of Th17In response to the surrounding microenvironment Th17 cells can secrete IFN-g and IL-22 and express FoxP3 in addition to the canonical Th17 cytokines e.g.

For example IL-12 and IL- 23 can enhance T-bet and promote a switch to a Th1 phenotype or IL-17th IFNgth cells e whilst IL-4 can increase GATA3 and induce IL-4 expression in Th17 cells  and anti-TNF-a via cMaf and Aiolos could drive IL-10 expression in Th17 cells .

IL-10 production by Th17 cells has been strongly related to the acquisi- tion of regulatory properties by Th17 cells and the resolution of intestinal inflammation .

In addition Th17 cells occasionally express FoxP3 to maintain immune cell suppression for homeo- static status of the gut e. This could explain the greater plasticity of Th17 cells compared to other T cell classes when exposed to a change in cytokine milieu.

It has beenSimilar to Ikaros Aiolos may favour a Th17 outcome as Th17 frequencies are reduced and Th1 cells increased in Aiolos deficient mice.

Although the full mechanism by which Aiolos favours Th17 development remains unclear its ability to suppress IL-2 expression  a property also shared by Ikaros and Eos  might be involved since IL-2 is inhibitory to Th17 differ- entiation.

Tumour Necrosis Factor a TNFa is a key inflammatory mediator produced by M4 and other immune cells and is responsible for a diverse range of signalling events within immune and non-immune cells leading to accelerating inflammation.Table 2List of Ikaros family influencing T cell development and plasticity.Environmental cues towards Th17 plasticityThe gut microbiotaSince transdifferentiation between Treg and Th17 is diminished in germ-free conditions the microbiota is considered a major player in the generation of this population in the gut e. Clostridia species in particular are recognised for their contribution to gut homeostasis through T cell plasticity.
