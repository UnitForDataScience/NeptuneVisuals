fumonisin b1 and hydrolysed fumonisin b1 concentration were analysed by liquid chromatograghy - mass spectrometry.

these results indicate that fumonisin b1 can be metabolised by caecal microbiota in pigs though the number of studied bacteria did not change.k e y w o r d s caecal microbiota fumonisin b1 intestinal microflora pigintroductionthe fumonisins are known as important mycotoxins produced mostly by several fusarium species which are found mainly in maize and its products all over the world.

detection was performed using selected ion monitoring sim mode.the efficiency of fb1 conversion to fully hydrolysed fb1 hfb1 was calculated on the basis of the mole-cular weight of the compounds fb1 721 gmol hfb1 405 gmol and described as belowhydrolysed fumonisin b1 molg x 721 gmol 405 gmol x fumonisin b1 molgstatistical analysis.

no significant differences in the amount of bacterial groups between the experimental buffer chyme and fumonisin b1 and control 1 groups buffer  chyme were observed in both methods.

there was no significant difference in fb1 concentration between the experimental and the control 2 group buffer and fumonisin b1 at 0 h incubation 5.185 - 0.174 ugml com- pared with 6.433 - 0.076 ugml.

fumonisin b1 concentration in the experimental group was reduced to 4.080 - 0.065 ugml at 24 h and to 2.747 - 0.548 ugml at 48 h incubation and was significantly less than that of in the control group.

hydrolysed fumonisin b1 was detected after 24 h incubation 0.012 - 0 ugml.

at 48 h incubation time hydrolysed fumonisin b1 concentration was doubled to 0.024 - 0.004 ugml.
