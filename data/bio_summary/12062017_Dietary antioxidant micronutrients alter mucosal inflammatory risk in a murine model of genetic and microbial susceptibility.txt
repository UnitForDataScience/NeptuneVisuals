In contrast to the marked histological inflammation visible in IL-10-- CONT IL-10-- AOX prevented goblet cell depletion and epithelial erosion.To investigate inflammatory contribution from lamina propria neutrophils IF was performed for myeloperoxidase staining see reference   which was found to be significantly elevated in IL-10-- CONT compared with WT CONT Pb.05 and WT AOX Pb.01 but mitigated in IL-10-- AOX samples Pb.05 compared with IL-10-- CONT.

There were no MLN weight mg g body weight differences in WT animals E. However the MLN weights in IL- 10-- CONT were significantly greater than WT CONT Pb.01 and IL- 10-- AOX MLN weight were significantly decreased compared with IL-10-- CONT Pb.05.

There were no significant changes in the relative expression of mucosal cytokines in WT mice between diets however compared with WT CONT TNFa IFNg and IL-17a were significantly elevated in IL-10-- CONT samples Pb.01 each.

At baseline IL-10-- CONT animals had larger spleen weight F compared with WT CONT Pb.01 and AOX mitigated this in IL-10-- animals Pb.05.Mucosal T lymphocyte populationsTo characterize changes in cytokines at the cellular level additional experiments were performed for flow cytometry analysis of lamina propria T lymphocytes in IL-10-- animals A.

Compared with WT CONT animals IL-10-- CONT animals expressed greater levels of CD103 expression Pb.05 at baseline while CCR9 did not reach significance.

Compared with WT CONT IgA levels were higher but not significant in IL-10-- CONT at baseline.

Consistent with the donor microbiota GF animals colonized with AOX had greater relative levels of the phylum Bacteriodetes and less Ver- rucomicrobia than CONT animals F. Principal component analysis demonstrates the composition of CONT and AOX colonized animals clustered differentially F. Taxonomic changes at the genera level are displayed in reference Table 3.DiscussionInflammatory bowel diseases IBD are believed to result from host genetic susceptibility in response to dietary environmental and microbial triggers that lead to chronic inflammatory responses.

Using a mucosal inflammatory model that resembles the human condition of ileal pouchitis we investigated the effects of Control CONT or Antioxidant AOX diet containing pharmacologically relevant levels of 4 micronutrients on disease risk in wild-type and IL-10-- animals following surgical self-filling SF ileal blind loop placement.

Although no differences were found in body weight change or survival IL-10-- CONT animals had significantly larger lymphoid organs compared with IL-10-- AOX or with WT.

SF loops from IL-10-- CONT loop mucosa demonstrated histological inflammation characterized by goblet cell depletion increased mucosal myeloperoxidase MPO and elevated IFNg TNFa and IL-17a gene expression which AOX attenuated.
