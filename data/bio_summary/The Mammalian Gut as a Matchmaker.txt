They observed that phage P10 requires the help of an intermediate bacterial host found in the mouse gut to adapt to the previously resistant bacterial strain which could help to understand some of the underlying processes behind phage persistence in the gut.

between the in vitro and in vivo responsesdue to phage adaptation to a more com- plex environment such as the mouse gut Are tail fibers the mutation hotspot of gut phages in active interaction withtheir bacterial hosts And can mutationanalysis of phages' tail fiber regions be prospectively used to improve our under- standing of phage-bacteria interactions in the human gut.

In this issue of Cell Host  Microbe provide insights into phage-bacteria interactions finding that microbial communities contribute to phage persistence in the mammalian gut by supplying new hosts.The human gut is the densest microbial habitat known containing trillions of mi- croorganisms bacteria phages or bac- terial viruses viruses fungi etc..

To avoid phage infection and killing of the cell there is a selective pressure for the bacterium to alter its re- ceptors and subsequently for the phage to modify its tail fibers  .

In addition the authors observed that the adaptation process differently affects phage P10 variants some variants showed a narrower host range compared to the wild-type strain while others had a broader host range confirming that the heterogeneity in the viral population increases their ability to adapt to new environments.SNP analysis allowed to find that the muta- tion patterns are different when phage P10 replicates in vitro rela- tive to in vivo.

Transmission of a Phage to a New Bacterium Mediated by an Intermediate HostA point mutation that changes adenine blue to guanine green in the phage tail fiber region facilitates the adaptation of the phage to a new bacterial host.

Phages may regulate bacterial physiology diver- sity and abundance in the gut as they do in other ecosystems thereby influ- encing our health  .Phages owe their specificity to a key and lock interaction mechanism between the phage's tail fibers and their cognate bacterial surface receptors.

They used comparative popula- tion genomics to study the interactions between a virulent phage P10 its bac- terial host and a bacterial strain resis- tant to P10 both in vitro using liquid cul- tures and in vivo in the mouse gut.
