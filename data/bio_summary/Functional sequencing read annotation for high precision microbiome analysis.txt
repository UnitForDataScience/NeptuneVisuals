FM and MM identified 923 E.C.s in common while 175 and 40 E.C.s were uniquely identi- fied by faser and MG-RAST respectively Figure C. In other words for the same artificial metagenome faser an- notates 14 more functions E.C.s than MG-RAST al- gorithms.

FG returned 909 E.C.s 65 588 E.C.s are GS-set specific while MM returned 1 627 E.C.s 65 1 062 E.C.s are md5nr specific.

Further an exponential decay curve as for HSSP calculations  can be used to iden- tify the alignments in this space as true positives alignments of peptides to proteins of identical function that fall above or on the curve false positives different functions above or on the curve true negatives different functions below the curve and false negatives identical functions below the curve.

However both pipelines agreed that i samples taken in the same phase were highly functionally correlated Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ii samples in oil phase were functionally more correlated with samples in recovered phase than pre-oil phase Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 which may indicate that the environment has not fully re- covered from the contamination and iii 20 of reads in all samples mapped to housekeeping functions house- keeping E.C.s complied from .

We created faser functional annotation of sequencing reads an algorithm that is optimized to map reads to molecular functions encoded by the read-correspondent genes.

The mi- faser microbiome analysis pipeline combining faser with our manually curated reference database of protein functions accurately annotates microbiome molecular functionality.

The faser algorithm in combination with the GS database annotates the artificial metagenome functions in a manner complementary to MG- RAST.

The faser al- gorithm significantly outperforms PSI-BLAST in differ- entiating functions at high-resolution levels.

The highly-parallelized and fast mi-faser pipeline faser in combination with GS was able to identify in BP oil spill data unique candidate functions associated with oil- degradation which were missed by the MG-RAST pipeline.

The Venn diagrams of the numbers of E.C.s annotated by different such combinations were generated by Venny .
