The HPLC-DAD chromatograms of tannic acid at 270 nm.Determination of GA Content in GCEGA content is 71.3-0.2 2.8-0.02 and 0.5-0.003 ww in GCE eGCE and tannic acid respectively indicating that GCE contained a high amount of GA while eGCE and tannic acid had little.Effects on Demineralization of Bovine EnamelThe CDRs analysis is presented in Fig.

GCE eGCE and tannic acid could significantly reduce the acid production and CFU counting compared with DDW group ANOVA P  0.05 whereas eGCE and tannic acid were more effective than GCE ANOVA P  0.05.

All the GCE eGCE and tannic acid contained high level of total phenolics while eGCE and Tannic acid had more tannin than GCE indicating these two extracts had stronger capability to precipitate proteins.

The present study focused on the comparison of composition and anticaries effect of Galla chinensis extracts with different isolation methods aiming to improve the efficacy of caries prevention.MethodsThe composition of water extract GCE ethanol extract eGCE and commercial tannic acid was compared.

The mz values revealed that GCE were mixtures consisting mainly of GA and its isomer and 1-3 galloylglucopyranoses GGs while eGCE mainly contained GA and 4-7 GGs and tannic acid mainly contained 5-10 GGs.Table 1.

The main molecular mass range corresponding compounds and mz values observed from negative ion experiments with HPLC-TOF-MS for eGCE and GCE and tannic acid.a 1-10GGs represented galloylglucopyranose di-galloylglucopyranose tri-galloylglucopyranose tetra-galloylglucopyranose penta- galloylglucopyranose hexa-galloylglucopyranose hepta-galloylglucopyranose octa-galloylglucopyranose ennea-galloylglucopyranose deca-  - .b 169 331 483 635 787 939 1091 1243 1395 1547 and 1699 would match with the M-H- ions of gallic acid 1-10GGs respectively.Fig.

The data show that all Galla chinensis extracts could inhibit enamel demineralization and GCE was less effective than eGCE and tannic acid.Fig.
