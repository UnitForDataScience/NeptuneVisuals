We hypothesize that the factors that control H. pylori's ability to colonize the gastric glands will help explain H. pylori's ability to persist long- term in the stomach and to cause gastric diseases.Despite living in the stomach H. pylori is not an acidophile and swims away from hydro- chloric acid HCl.

Despite the higher loads of DtlpAD H. pylori in omeprazole-treated animals the mutant is unable to colo- nize the gastric glands to the same levels as wild-type suggesting that these two chemorecep- tors are important in establishing colonization deep in the gastric glands.Our study has identified two new roles for H. pylori's chemoreceptors as acid sensors and demonstrate that H. pylori's ability to detect and respond to the acid gradient is important for its localization within the stomach its interaction with the glandular epithelium and its sur- vival in vivo.ResultsH.

Since H. pylori's TlpB chemoreceptor has been reported to detect HCl as a repellent  and we found that it detects urea as a high- sensitivity attractant  we wondered how H. pylori would respond if it were simultaneously exposed to both urea and HCl gradients emanating from one point source.We used our previously described microgradient chemotaxis assay   to record the swimming responses of a live culture of H. pylori strain PMSS1 exposed to a microscopic gra- dient of a mixture of 50 mM HCl and 5 mM urea emanating from the tip of a microinjection needle.

This may have critical implications for H. pylori's survival in the stomach.Loss of both TlpA and TlpD creates a deficiency in H. pylori's ability to colonize the stomach and this deficiency can be rescued by inhibiting acid production in the stomachGiven the importance of avoiding the acidic lumen of the stomach environment we next investigated whether DtlpAD H. pylori would be able to colonize the stomachs of mice.

By directly visualizing H. pylori swimming behavior when encountering a micro-scopic gradient consisting of the repellent acid and attractant urea we found that H. pylori isOPEN ACCESSCitation Huang JY Goers Sweeney E Guillemin K Amieva MR 2017 Multiple Acid Sensors Control Helicobacter pylori Colonization of the Stomach.

We recently reported that TlpB can also sense chemoattractants since it is a high affinity chemore- ceptor for urea that allows H. pylori to sensitively detect and swim towards urea emanating from the gastric epithelium .In this study we initially proceeded to investigate how H. pylori may be sensing both a repellent and an attractant through TlpB.

DtlpA H. pylori like wild-type responds to a minimal effective concentration of 25 mM HCl while DtlpD H. pylori requires 50 mM HCl to respond .
