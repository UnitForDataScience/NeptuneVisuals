Alterations in the gut microbiota are associated with a number of conditions that cause bone loss or increase fracture risk including malnutrition12 inflammatory bowel disease3-5 obesity67 and metabolic disease.8-10 The gut microbiota therefore have the potential to influence bone and contribute to differencesin fracture risk among patient populations.The gut microbiome is initially obtained at birth11 and subsequently shaped by factors such as environment12 and diet.1314 Exposure to the gut microbiome is necessary for the proper education and development of the innate and adaptive immune systems.15 Dendritic cells macrophages granulocytesT and B cells and intestinal epithelial cells directly interact with the gut microbiome.15 Toll-like receptors are one set of receptors on immune cells that recognize the components of the gut microbiome and facilitate communication between the gut microbiome and the immune system.16 Alterations in the gut microbiota or improper communication between the immune system and gut microbiota can lead to chronic immune responses and disease.17The effects of the microbiome on bone structure and density have been studied in mice using two standard tools for manipulating the microbiome germ-free animals and oral antibiotic treatments.1819 The changes in bone after these manipulations of the gut flora differ considerably among studies.

Third the reduction in peak bending moment seen in mice with a disrupted microbiota is not fully explained by changes in bone geometry or bone mass whereas in animal models of reduced dietary calcium and vitamin D reductions in whole- bone strength are usually well described by changes in bone geometry mass and tissue mineral density.6061 Last examina- tion of colon histology did not indicate intestinal inflammation in any of our groups suggesting that treatment with antibiotics to disrupt the gut microbiota did not lead to increased gut inflammation which can impair nutritional absorption.6263 Animal models with extensive intestinal inflammation com- monly develop reduced body mass and dramatic trabecularbone loss which again was not present in any of our treatment groups.6465Translocation of bacterial products or even live bacteria across the gut endothelial barrier is another potential mecha- nism for gut microbiota to influence bone.

The contents of the gut microbiota are dynamic and robust to external stimuli short-term treatments  1 to 2 weeks with antibiotics generate a transient change in the gut microbiota that mostly returns to baseline when treatment is suspended.49 To examine a condition of sustained alterations in the gut microbiota during growth we treated mice with chronic antibiotics from the age of weaning until skeletal maturity.

The high relative abundance of Proteobacteria observed in mice with a disrupted microbiota at 16 weeks of age was similar to the immature and unstable gut microbiota typical of newbornmice.45 As a mouse matures its immune system begins to regulate gut microbiota composition via B cell production of IgA antibodies that target Proteobacteria.45 The antibiotic treatment in the current study may have prevented the shift from Proteobacteria to Bacteroidetes that normally occurs in mice after weaning.

The diversity of the gut microbiota as measured by the Shannon diversity index was reduced in groups with a disrupted gut microbiota TLR5KO 4.8 0.5 TLR5KO DMicrobiota 1.7 0.2WT 4.7 0.4 and WT DMicrobiota 2.5 0.3 p  0.05 Fig.

Disruption of the gut microbiota with antibiotics did not alter total bacterial load but had dramatic effects on gut microbiota composition and bacterial diversity and immune cell count.

Our findings in mice suggest an intriguing possibility that alterations in gut microbiota may contribute to alterations in clinical fracture risk by regulating bone tissue mechanical properties although further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.ConclusionWe conclude that alterations in the gut microbiota throughout growth can lead to changes in whole-bone strength which are greater than expected from whole-bone size or shape.

Toll-like receptor 5 TLR5 is the innate immune receptor for flagellin and does not have an endogenous ligand.26 Hence phenotypic traits of the TLR5KO mouse are primarily due to alterations in host-microbe interactions.27 Failure of the TLR5KO mouse to respond to flagellin is associated with changes in the gut microbiome that lead to increases in intestinal and systemic inflammation and a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype characterized by mild obesity insulin resistance increased blood pressure and increased blood glucose.2728 The metabolic syndrome-like phenotype of the TLR5KO mouse does not develop in mice raised in a germ-free environment and can be transferred to wild-type WT mice through transplantation of the gut microbiota demonstrating that the phenotype depends on the gut flora.28 Although prior work has shown that the disruption or absence of the microbiome can influence bone interpreting conflicting findings among studies is challenging because many prior studies use young animals of different ages less than 12 weeks of age or low-resolution imaging techniques mouse DXA.

p  0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.To understand the mechanisms linking changes in the microbiota to impaired bone tissue material properties it is useful to consider the three primary mechanisms through which the microbiome can influence organs distant from the gut regulation of the immune system regulation of nutrient absorption and translocation of bacterial products across the epithelial barrier.53We consider the effects of the microbiota on the immune system to be a likely explanation for the differences in bone tissue material properties in the current study.
