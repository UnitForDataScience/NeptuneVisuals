In our present results the significantly high gastrocnemius muscle weights in the D-ESM8 mice indicate a lower energy demand than that in the DSS group thereby inhibiting the degradation of muscle tissue which was also reflected by high levels of plasma amino acids and the recovery of the TCA-cycle intermediates in the D-ESM8 group.Consistent with the proteome results our metabolome analysis revealed high TCA cycle and glycolysis inter- mediates in the livers of the DSS mice indicating a hepatic accumulation of these intermediates.

The percent variations by the unweighted metric of the CON DSS and D-ESM8 groups were 21.10 7.27 and 13.13 respectively 7c which indi- cates that rare bacteria altered the community structure of these groups.The clustering of the CON DSS and D-ESM8 groups by the weighted UniFrac distances showed 62.36 3.23 and 20.38 variations respectively indicating that bacterial communities were more evident d. Regardless of the rare and abundant bacteria these data suggest that microbial communities are differentially improved by ESM indicating that the changes in microbiome diversity may be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of ESM.Increased Enterobacteriaceae which is a marker of intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in human IBD and murine colitis was detected significantly more frequently in the inflammatory DSS groups Proteobacteria phylum reaching 39 of the total bacteria compared to the CON group Suppl.

5.0 software to determine the gene expression ratios for the CON versus DSS mice and for the DSS versus D-ESM8 mice.

Normal control mice CON group were given the AIN-93G basal diet and drinking water without DSS for the entire course of the experiment.The DAI was monitored every day after the start of the DSS-water administration using three scores for body weight stool consistency and fecal blood of the mice then calculated by averaging these three scores.

Exposure of DSS-treated mice to ESM also down-regulated the gene expression levels of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP family Mmp7 and Mmp9 and up-regulated the gene expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase Timp2 and Timp3 which are involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling in normal physiological processes and disease progression.In addition the expression levels of the genes coding for antimicrobial peptides and microbial growth related genes lipocalin-2 Lcn2 regenerating islet-derived 3 gamma Reg3g S100 calcium binding protein S100a8 S100a9 and formyl peptide receptor 1 Fpr1 as well as an oxidative activity-associated gene nitric oxide synthase 2 Nos2 were also lower in the D-ESM8 group compared to the DSS group 3b.Consistent with the ESM's regulatory action in Caco-2 cells the ESM diet attenuated the transcription levels of critical intestinal epithelial proliferation- and restitution-related genes which are involved in the migration of cells homing organization of the cytoskeleton proliferation of cells and necrosis Suppl.

The level of segmented filamentous bacteria SFB 5d which promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells was significantly higher in the DSS group compared to that of the control mice and this high SFB abundance was reversed in the D-ESM8 group.
