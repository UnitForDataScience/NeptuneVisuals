Similarly the beta diversity estimates for the human skin samples showed greater variability when evaluated using the Unweighted UniFrac for the two primer pairs on the two platforms when compared to the results from the Bray Curtis distance matrix.DiscussionIn this paper we have described the development of a methodology for investigation of a very low biomass bacterial community using the MiSeq platform and compared data to that generated using the Roche 454 Junior system.Comprehensive identification of any bacterial commu- nity is dependent on several steps including a robust bacterial DNA extraction method.

Therefore the data generated using the V3-V4 primer pair using the MiSeq can be compared with the existing data in the human microbiome literature.Four of the eight skin samples showed high levels of chimera 20 on data analysis on the MiSeq platform and could not be confidently included in the compara- tive analysis between platforms.

Therefore our results pro- vide evidence for validation of the MiSeq platform against the Roche454 using a known mock bacterial community containing typical skin bacteria and also evidence that the optimised method can be used in human clinical samples.MethodsAim design and setting of studyThe aim of the study was to optimise and validate the method for generation of the 16S rRNA library and compare the MiSeq against the 454 platform for the 16S rRNA data generated when using low bacterial biomass samples such as skin swabs to study the human bacterial microbiome.SubjectsHealthy volunteers age range 30-50 years were recruited to this study after obtaining informed verbal consent MREC 99884.

At the phylum level Additional file Table S2a there was an identical distribution between the two platforms for the V3-V4 hypervariable region but less consistency for the V1-V3 hypervariable region.At the genus level Additional file Table S2b again the V3-V4 primer data showed better concordance between platforms than the V1-V3 primer pair.Comparison of beta diversity estimates of the mock bacterial community and the pilot data from skin swabs using procrustes PCoA plotsThe results of the Procrustes principle coordinates matrices are presented Fig.

Results demonstrated that the MiSeq performance was similar to the Roche 454 Junior platform in identifying community diversity for both the mock bacterial community and the skin sam- ples at the phylum and the genus level.Studies using the MiSeq platform have commonly used the V4 primer pair  or the V3 primer pair which limits the read length to 250 bp.

When the primer pairs were compared between platforms the V3-V4 primer pair performed better with values closer to the expected relative abundance of the mock community in comparison to that of the V1-V3 primer pair Additional file Table S1.The V3-V4 primer pair demonstrated a maximum ab- solute difference of 7.96 and a minimum of 0.06 when compared between platforms.

The phylogenetic ana- lysis of the data was performed using QIIME  soft- ware and operational taxonomic units OTU were assigned at 97 identity at genus level using the Green- genes database  Three of the eight HV skin swab samples passed stringent QC thresholds on both the MiSeq and Roche 454 Junior and were available for subsequent NGS platform comparison.Fig.
