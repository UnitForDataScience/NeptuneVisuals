therefore our results pro- vide evidence for validation of the miseq platform against the roche454 using a known mock bacterial community containing typical skin bacteria and also evidence that the optimised method can be used in human clinical samples.methodsaim design and setting of studythe aim of the study was to optimise and validate the method for generation of the 16s rrna library and compare the miseq against the 454 platform for the 16s rrna data generated when using low bacterial biomass samples such as skin swabs to study the human bacterial microbiome.subjectshealthy volunteers age range 30-50 years were recruited to this study after obtaining informed verbal consent mrec 99884. they had no history of skin diseases or evidence of skin infections and had not used topical anti- biotics topical steroids or systemic antibiotics in the last 6 months.

similarly the beta diversity estimates for the human skin samples showed greater variability when evaluated using the unweighted unifrac for the two primer pairs on the two platforms when compared to the results from the bray curtis distance matrix.discussionin this paper we have described the development of a methodology for investigation of a very low biomass bacterial community using the miseq platform and compared data to that generated using the roche 454 junior system.comprehensive identification of any bacterial commu- nity is dependent on several steps including a robust bacterial dna extraction method.

therefore the data generated using the v3-v4 primer pair using the miseq can be compared with the existing data in the human microbiome literature.four of the eight skin samples showed high levels of chimera 20 on data analysis on the miseq platform and could not be confidently included in the compara- tive analysis between platforms.

at the phylum level additional file table s2a there was an identical distribution between the two platforms for the v3-v4 hypervariable region but less consistency for the v1-v3 hypervariable region.at the genus level additional file table s2b again the v3-v4 primer data showed better concordance between platforms than the v1-v3 primer pair.comparison of beta diversity estimates of the mock bacterial community and the pilot data from skin swabs using procrustes pcoa plotsthe results of the procrustes principle coordinates matrices are presented fig.

results demonstrated that the miseq performance was similar to the roche 454 junior platform in identifying community diversity for both the mock bacterial community and the skin sam- ples at the phylum and the genus level.studies using the miseq platform have commonly used the v4 primer pair  or the v3 primer pair which limits the read length to 250 bp.

when the primer pairs were compared between platforms the v3-v4 primer pair performed better with values closer to the expected relative abundance of the mock community in comparison to that of the v1-v3 primer pair additional file table s1.the v3-v4 primer pair demonstrated a maximum ab- solute difference of 7.96 and a minimum of 0.06 when compared between platforms.

skin swabs from healthy volunteers were also tested to confirm the method is applicable to the study of the human skin microbiome.resultsbacterial dna extraction using the mobio powersoil dna isolation kitwe modified the mobio powersoilr dna isolation kit manufacturer's protocol to include and extend the beadbeating and heat incubation steps see s to increase the efficacy of lysis of gram positive bacterial cell walls.

the phylogenetic ana- lysis of the data was performed using qiime  soft- ware and operational taxonomic units otu were assigned at 97 identity at genus level using the green- genes database  three of the eight hv skin swab samples passed stringent qc thresholds on both the miseq and roche 454 junior and were available for subsequent ngs platform comparison.fig.

however it was observed that in the hv skin samples this was not a limiting factor as bacteria could be identified to the genus level despite using the version 2 chemistry on the miseq.conclusionsour study reports on the optimization of a protocol that can be used in investigating a low microbial bio- mass community such as in skin samples.

the sampling technique described in the nih microbiome manual of procedures was used to col- lect the samples in an aseptic manner using catch-alltmepicentrer swabs pre-moistened with sample collection fluid 50mmol tris with 1 mm edta and 0.5 tween 20. to increase the yield of the skin bacterial flora the nih protocol was modified to ensure that 4 cm2 area of skin at the antecubital fossa was swabbed.

our aims were first to determine the hypervariable re- gion which will provide the most comprehensive capturetable 1 dna yield when using the modified dna extraction protocolof the microbial diversity in human skin communities second to confirm that the primer set for amplification of that hypervariable region is specific and will not amp- lify human dna contaminants and finally to compare the performance of the miseq with the roche 454 plat- form which has been the established technology.
