Green bars represent control offspring and red bars represent BPA-exposed offspring.in BPA-exposed offspring compared to control offspring.

B to D Beta diversity plots for colon B cecum C and feces D with samples clustering according to the unweighted UniFrac metric.UniFrac  distances and were significantly different between BPA-exposed offspring and control offspring for cecum and feces permutational multivariate analysis of variance PERMANOVA of unweighted UniFrac distances P values were 0.12 0.001 and0.01 for colon cecum and feces respectively.

were higher in the colonic digesta of control offspring than in that of BPA-treated offspring  and .

LDA scores that were elevated in control dams or offspring are shown in green whereas LDA scores that were greater in BPA-treated dams or offspring are shown in red.

In the colon only histidine levels were significantly reduced in the control offspring compared to the BPA-exposed offspring.

The liver metabolites whose levels were significantly different after adjusting for multiple testing FDR were reduced in BPA- exposed offspring compared to control offspring Table S2.

Ribulose-5-phosphate dihydroxy-acetone- phosphate and D-glyceraldehdye-3-phosphate levels showed a 2-fold difference between control offspring and BPA-exposed offspring.

A recent study  reported significant differences in fecal microbial composition between offspring of unexposed mice and offspring with parental exposure to BPA.

The genera Methanobrevibacter in the colon and Dorea in the cecum showed significance at P values of 0.1 after Bonferroni correction in comparisons between BPA-exposed offspring and control offspring .

However BPA exposure in rats caused a reduction in colonic paracellular permeability instead of an increase in female offspring but not in male offspring.
