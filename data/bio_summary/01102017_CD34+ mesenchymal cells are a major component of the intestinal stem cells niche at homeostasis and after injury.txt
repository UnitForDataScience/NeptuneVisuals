2d suggesting that cd34 cscs impair epithelial differentiation.to determine whether cd34 cscs affect the activity of lgr5 iescs normally restricted to crypts in fully differentiated organoids 27 we cocultured cd34 cscs with crypts isolated from lgr5-egfp mice 1. spheroids induced by cd34 cscs contained a significantly higher proportion of lgr5 stem cells up to 30 compared with organoids grown without mesen- chymal cells 2 fig.

remarkably maintenance of iescs by cd34 cscs re- quired their continuous presence because spheroids rapidly differentiated into organoids when removed from cd34 cscs- containing medium fig.

these data show that gp38 cd34 stromal cells expressing high levels of grem1 develop in the in- testinal submucosa during the first weeks after birth and then are mostly localized around the crypts after 3 wk of age.intestinal injury induces remodeling and activation of cd34 cscs.

cd34 cscs isolated from dss-inflamed colon overexpressed niche factors grem1 and rspo1 compared with cd34 cscs at steady state suggesting that their prostemness function is maintained during intestinal inflammation fig.

in addition cd34 cscs isolated from acutely inflamed colon significantly overexpressed compared with cd34 cscs at steady state transcripts coding for ccl2 mcp-1 and csf1 m-csf essential for the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to inflamed tissues and for macrophage mainte- nance respectively the neutrophil chemoattractants cxcl1 and cxcl2 the proinflammatory cytokine il6 as well as ccl19 cxcl13 icam1 trance rankl and tnfr1 all involved in the organization of adaptive immune responses and the lymphangiogenic growth factors vegfc vegfd and ffg2 fig.

consistent with this hypothesis forced expression of grem1 in epithelial cells is sufficient to disrupt intestinal morphogenic gradients pro- moting the persistence or reacquisition of stem cells properties by differentiated epithelial cells 35. the massive epithelial pro- liferation observed in cd34 csc-induced spheroids is therefore consistent with a global activation of wnt signaling normally re- stricted to the crypts 36. in the colon which lacks paneth cells cd34 cscs production of wnt2b rspo1 and grem1 may therefore represent the major source of niche signals supporting iescs.

accordingly depletion of intestinal mesenchymal cells expressing the transcription factor foxl1 28 also expressed by cd34 cscs is sufficient to severely affect crypt proliferation.we further show that cd34 cscs are topographically andfunctionally distinct from asma subepithelial myofibroblastsidentified as gp38 cd34- asmahigh cd34- myofs which are located beneath epithelial cells in the ileum villi and colon tops.

expression by cd34 cscs of ptgs2 after injury necessary for regenerativeresponses after dss-induced colitis 41 further supports this hypothesis.finally given their central role in promoting proliferation of iescs and inflammation cd34 cscs may play a role in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.

here we identify pericryptal cd34 gp38 asma- mesenchymal cells closely associated with lgr5 iescs.

we demonstrate that cd34 gp38 cells are the major intestinal producers of the niche factors wnt2b gremlin1 and r-spondin1 and are sufficient to promote maintenance of lgr5 iescs in intestinal organoids an effect mainly mediated by gremlin1.

cd34 gp38 cells develop after birth in the intestinal submucosa and expand around the crypts during the third week of life in mice independently of the microbiota.

our results indicate that cd34 gp38 mesenchymal cells are programmed to develop in the intestine after birth to constitute a specialized microenvironment that main- tains iescs at homeostasis and contribute to intestinal inflamma- tion and repair after injury.intestinal stem cells  mesenchymal niche  inflammation  cd34he adult intestinal epithelium is one of the most rapidly self- renewing tissues in mammals.
