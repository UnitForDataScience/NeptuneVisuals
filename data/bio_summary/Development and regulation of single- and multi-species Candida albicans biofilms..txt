The hyphae that form in the later stages of C. albicans biofilm development form a scaffold that supports the different components of the biofilm thereby contributing to the overall architectural stability of the biofilm structure.

It may seem counterintuitive that so many other transcriptional regulators are also required for the initial adherence step in biofilm formation however this observation indicates how little we currently understand about this step in biofilm formation.Production of the extracellular matrixA mature C. albicans biofilm is encased in an extracellular matrix that is a mixture of glycoproteins 55 carbohydrates 25 largely a-mannan and b-16-glucan polysaccharides and to a lesser extent b-13-glucan lipids 15 and nucleic acids 570.

In agreement with this notion one study has shown that eDNA is present at all stages of biofilm development and that treatment with DNase decreases biofilm biomass at later time points in biofilm formation71.Two transcriptional regulators Rlm1 and Zap1 also known as Csr1 have been implicated in matrix production.

Formation of Candida albicans biofilmsa  The formation of Candida albicans biofilms has been divided into four major stages adherence of round yeast-form cells to a surface initiation of biofilm formation during which the cells adhered to the surface form a basal layer that contains yeast-form pseudohyphal and hyphal cells also known as the proliferation stage maturation into a complex structured biofilm in which cells are encased in the extracellular matrix and dispersion of yeast-form cells from the biofilm to seed new sites.

Critically ill patients are often unable to tolerate these procedures leaving few if any available treatment options in these cases1926.In this Review we provide an overview of the processes involved in the formation of a C. albicans biofilm and discuss the transcriptional circuitry that regulates biofilm development.

albicans biofilm formationThe current understanding of C. albicans biofilm development is based on in vitro experiments in vivo animal models of infection and examination of biofilms that formed on medical devices in the clinic BOX 1.

In vitro results suggest that biofilm formation begins with the adherence of yeast-form cells to a solid surface and the formation of a basal layer that functions to anchor the biofilm.

The biofilm matrix functions as a protective physical barrier from the environment and provides structural integrity to the biofilm and it is critical in the resistance of mature biofilms to mechanical disruption.

Although the general progression of biofilm developmentand the properties of the mature structure have been studied primarily in vitro many of the same features for example a several-hundred- micrometre-thick biofilm consisting of yeast- form cells at the base hyphal and pseudohyphal cells throughout the structure and a thick extracellular matrix have also been observed in vivo in rabbit mouse and rat catheter models in vivo in rat denture models and in vivo and ex vivo in mouse vaginal models.

C. albicans biofilms have also been extensively observed in clinical settings for example on catheters and dentures of patients33-42.Lohse et al.Page 4Regulation of biofilm developmentIn light of the large number of differences between biofilm cells and planktonic cells it is not surprising that more than 50 transcriptional regulators have been linked to the formation of C. albicans biofilms143-45 FIG.
