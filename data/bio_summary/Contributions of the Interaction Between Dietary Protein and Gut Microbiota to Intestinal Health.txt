Attention should be given to the dietary strategies with judicious selection of source and sup- plementation of dietary protein to benefit gut health.Keywords Dietary protein intestinal microbiota metabolites gut barrier amino acid balance digestibility.INTRODUCTIONIntestinal microbiota play an important role in host growth and health.

Moreover several AA released by gut bacteria can serve as precursors for the synthesis of SCFAs which also play a significant role in development of obesity.In this review we aim to compile the available evidence on the contribution of dietary protein to gut microbiota com- position and function.

The more surplus nitrogen in the large gut due to a lower digesti- bility of plant proteins can benefit bacteria of those groupsinvolved in protein fermentation by providing proteins to these bacteria thus promote their proliferation.However studies contradict about the prominence of in- fluence on gut microbiome composition between higher and lower digestibility of protein.

We speculate that casein plays an important role in modulating gut microbiota through alteration of lysine and arginine in gut.

Considering that the epithelial cells of small intestinal villi absorb AA and other nutrients into gut and blood gut microbiota disturbance and malnutrition might be provoked when intestinal morphology is impaired.Diarrhea in piglets can be reduced if the feeding diet con- sists of low protein level and balanced AA composition.

By decreasing pH on the gut community 92 112 faecal butyrate has been shown to in- crease as well as total SCFAs concentrations in a more rapid gut transit 113.

However monoamine and diamine oxidases presented in the gut mu- cosa could detoxify the amines produced by the gut microbi- ota.

Thus more studies are required to elucidate rela- tionship between dietary protein and gut microbiome as well as the connection between microbial function and gut health.

Reciprocally it appears that the gut microbiota is also able to af- fect protein metabolism which gives rise to the view that function between the microbiota and protein can proceed in both directions.
