early protein intake and later obesitythere is increasing evidence that a high-protein intake during the first 2 years of life results in an increased risk of later obesity hornell lagstrom lande  thorsdottir 2013 michaelsen  greer 2014 voortman et al.

as a high intake of cow's milk during the complementary feeding period also increases the risk of iron deficiency anemia and limits the diversity of the diet it is prudent to recommend against a high intake of cow's milk during the complementary feeding period.

it has been suggested that the protein intake should not be above 15 of energy up to the age of 2 years nordic council of ministers 2012. according to the whofaounu recommenda- tions from 2007 the safe level of protein intake is 11.6 gday at the age of 1 year and 11.9 g at 2 years world health organisation foodand agriculture organization of the united nations  united nations university 2007. this can be covered by 300-350 ml of cow's milk.

2015. however there is increasing evidence that a high-fat intake during the comple- mentary feeding period is not related to later obesity agostoni  caroli 2012. furthermore one small observational study suggests that low-fat intake at 2 years can result in higher risk of obesity andleptin resistance at the age of 20 years rolland-cachera et al.2013.

although the triglyceride intake measured in this study was not necessarily representative of total fat intake it is interesting to note the parallel between these findings and those on complementary feeding discussed above.
