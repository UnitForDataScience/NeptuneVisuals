Those with an intake of cow's milk greater than 600 ml from milk intake had higher BMI up to the last examination at the age of 10 years compared to those being breastfed at 8 months Hopkins Steer Northstone  Emmett 2015.These data suggest that a high intake of protein especially dairy protein during the complementary feeding period is associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity later in childhood.

Early protein intake and later obesityThere is increasing evidence that a high-protein intake during the first 2 years of life results in an increased risk of later obesity Hornell Lagstrom Lande  Thorsdottir 2013 Michaelsen  Greer 2014 Voortman et al.

As a high intake of cow's milk during the complementary feeding period also increases the risk of iron deficiency anemia and limits the diversity of the diet it is prudent to recommend against a high intake of cow's milk during the complementary feeding period.

A low intake ofn-3 fatty acids has negative effects on cognitive development and immune functions and the balance between the intake of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids is important for immune function and growth Lauritzen Hansen Jorgensen  Michaelsen 2001.

Although the triglyceride intake measured in this study was not necessarily representative of total fat intake it is interesting to note the parallel between these findings and those on complementary feeding discussed above.

In both cases fat intake is not associated with later obesity or perhaps inversely associated whereasprotein intake is positively associated with the risk of later obesity.
