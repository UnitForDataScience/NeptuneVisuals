At the phylum level Erysipelotrichia and Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant in prebowel preparation faecal samples compared to paired biopsies P 0.010 and P  0.001 respectively whereas Bacteroidia and Betaproteobacteria were sig- nificantly lower in abundance P 14 0.033 and P 14 0.006.What Are the Effects of Bowel Preparation on the Faecal MicrobiotaTo determine the effects of bowel preparation on the faecal microbiota 6 sets of patient samples were considered each includ- ing faecal samples taken prebowel preparation luminal contents and postcolonoscopy faecal samples a median of 55 days after colonoscopy.The diversity of the microbial communities for each sample set was found to differ significantly Friedman test P 0.04 with lower diversity communities in luminal content samples median prebowel preparation diversity 14 4.82 luminal contents diversity 14 4.33 and postcolonoscopy diversity 14 4.85 although post-hoc analysis found233600 Patient 44002000BLRBLR6004002000Patient 7BLRBLR6004002000Patient 8BLRBLR6004002000Patient 9BLRPatient 13BLRGenerafamily keyOther MegamonasRuminococcaceae2 Ruminococcus Bifiobacterium Barnesiella Veillonella SutterellaDorea Pseudobutyrivibrio Alistipes Erysipelotrichaceae Streptococcus Peptostreptococcaceae Anaerostipes60040020006004002000Patient 15BLRPatient 28BLR60040020006004002000Patient 19BLRPatient 29BLR6004002000Patient 22BLR6004002000Patient 23BLRBlautiaParabacteroies Haemophilus Anaerococcus Prevotella Finegoldia Ruminococcaceae1 Lachnospiraceae3 Lachnospiraceae2 Peptoniphilus Escherichia Lachnospiraceae1Faecalibacterium BacteroidesFIGURE 3.

In our work bowel preparation appears sufficiently to cleanse the lumen to ensure that the luminal contents sampled at colonoscopy--being derived from surfacemucus-adherent microbes rather than the bulk faecal stream--contain a microbial community more similar to that of biopsy samples.Our analysis comparing patient's faecal microbiota pre- and postcolonoscopy indicates that bowel preparation does lead to changes in the faecal microbial community but that these do not appear to occur in a co-ordinated manner.

Biopsies were however significantly more similar to paired luminal contents than they were to paired pre- colonoscopy faecal samples P 0.04 mean distance between paired biopsies and colonoscopy faecal samples 0.53 4.Prebowel preparation faecal samples and paired biopsies did not have significantly different microbial community diversities median diversities of 4.48 and 4.35 respectively however multiple taxonomic groups were found to be differentially abundant.

After the removal of duplicates 17 biopsy samples 16 luminal content samples and 18 swabs taken at colonoscopy 11 prebowel preparation faecal samples and 7 postbowel preparation faecal samples were retained inclusive of 14 complete sets of sample taken at colonoscopy from patients who had undergone bowel preparation.Can Luminal Contents or Swabs Taken During Colonoscopy Act as a Surrogate for Biopsy Samples0.70.5Given the invasive nature of obtaining mucosal biopsy samples a less invasive surrogate sample would prove valuable if observations of the microbial community are sufficiently similar.

Generalized UniFrac distances between the paired biopsies and prebowel preparation faecal samples were found to be significantly lower than distances between biopsies P 0.03 median distance 0.53 between biopsies n 28 andbetween paired biopsies and prebowel preparation faecal samples n 8.

We investigate the relatedness of samples obtained by different methods and the effects of bowel preparation on the gastrointestinal community in a paediatric population.Methods We recruited a cohort of patients undergoing colonoscopy collecting serial samples via differing methods rectal swabs biopsies and faecal matterluminal contents prebowel preparation during colonoscopy and after colonoscopy.

These signals are not evident in samples before bowel preparation however suggesting that faecal material during colo- noscopy and postbowel preparation is more representative of the mucosal layer.The study population was comparable in size to similar studies and provides new paediatric data which build upon what is known from adult populations.Although larger patient cohorts could further explore our conclusions we provide evidence that the paediatric colonic micro- biota is subject to systematic variation depending upon sample method and bowel cleansing effects and that in pursuit of the mucosa-associated microbiota an invasive gut biopsy may not be required.
