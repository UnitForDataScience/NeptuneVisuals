in our work bowel preparation appears sufficiently to cleanse the lumen to ensure that the luminal contents sampled at colonoscopy--being derived from surfacemucus-adherent microbes rather than the bulk faecal stream--contain a microbial community more similar to that of biopsy samples.our analysis comparing patient's faecal microbiota pre- and postcolonoscopy indicates that bowel preparation does lead to changes in the faecal microbial community but that these do not appear to occur in a co-ordinated manner.

the authors report no conflicts of interest.copyright  2016 by european society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition and north american society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutritiondoi umans carry approximately 1011 bacterial organisms per gram of faecal material in their gastrointestinal tract alone collectively known as the gastrointestinal microbiota.

there is increasing evidence to suggest an associ- ation between dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and disease states most notably inflammatory bowel disease ibd colorectal cancer and obesity the gut microbiota can be sampled by a rectal mucosal biopsy faecal matterluminal contents or rectal swab but which is most representative all 3 methods have distinct advantages and disadvantages when practiced in paediatric populations.

where the interest is in the microbiota bacterial populations and diversity can also be assessed in faecal matter or rectal swabs.

faecal matter sampling is noninvasive and easy although patients dislike handling faeces and especially where sampling is requested at home compliance is often poor.

rectal swabbing is noninvasive less expensive less time consuming and more comfortable and acceptable for both adult and paediatric patients so this might be an ideal sampling method however the extent to which either approach provides information compar- able to mucosal biopsy is unknown.we hypothesize that rectal swabbing andor faecal sampling may be suitable noninvasive alternatives to a mucosal biopsy for sampling the gut microbiota.

sixteen patients provided a full set of samples swab biopsy and faecal sample at colonoscopy.

the precolonoscopy faecal sample was obtained before bowel preparation.
