At the phylum level Erysipelotrichia and Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant in prebowel preparation faecal samples compared to paired biopsies P 0.010 and P  0.001 respectively whereas Bacteroidia and Betaproteobacteria were sig- nificantly lower in abundance P 14 0.033 and P 14 0.006.What Are the Effects of Bowel Preparation on the Faecal MicrobiotaTo determine the effects of bowel preparation on the faecal microbiota 6 sets of patient samples were considered each includ- ing faecal samples taken prebowel preparation luminal contents and postcolonoscopy faecal samples a median of 55 days after colonoscopy.The diversity of the microbial communities for each sample set was found to differ significantly Friedman test P 0.04 with lower diversity communities in luminal content samples median prebowel preparation diversity 14 4.82 luminal contents diversity 14 4.33 and postcolonoscopy diversity 14 4.85 although post-hoc analysis found233600 Patient 44002000BLRBLR6004002000Patient 7BLRBLR6004002000Patient 8BLRBLR6004002000Patient 9BLRPatient 13BLRGenerafamily keyOther MegamonasRuminococcaceae2 Ruminococcus Bifiobacterium Barnesiella Veillonella SutterellaDorea Pseudobutyrivibrio Alistipes Erysipelotrichaceae Streptococcus Peptostreptococcaceae Anaerostipes60040020006004002000Patient 15BLRPatient 28BLR60040020006004002000Patient 19BLRPatient 29BLR6004002000Patient 22BLR6004002000Patient 23BLRBlautiaParabacteroies Haemophilus Anaerococcus Prevotella Finegoldia Ruminococcaceae1 Lachnospiraceae3 Lachnospiraceae2 Peptoniphilus Escherichia Lachnospiraceae1Faecalibacterium BacteroidesFIGURE 3.

Rectal swabs had a greater number of taxonomic groups that differed from paired biopsies with significant decreases in 3 Lachnospiraceae taxonomic groups P  0.001 P 0.027 P 0.038 Bacteroides P 0.015 Blautia P  0.001 and Ruminococcaceae P  0.001 and significant increases in Peptoniphilus and Finegoldia P  0.001.

Com- pared to paired biopsies the prebowel preparation faecal samples were found to have significantly higher abundances of Ruminococcus Bifidobacterium Blautia Subdoligranulum and Peptostreptococca- ceae P  0.001 and significantly decreased abundances of Faeca- libacterium P 0.002 and a Lachnospiraceae taxonomic group P  0.001.

Biopsies were however significantly more similar to paired luminal contents than they were to paired pre- colonoscopy faecal samples P 0.04 mean distance between paired biopsies and colonoscopy faecal samples 0.53 4.Prebowel preparation faecal samples and paired biopsies did not have significantly different microbial community diversities median diversities of 4.48 and 4.35 respectively however multiple taxonomic groups were found to be differentially abundant.

Generalized UniFrac distances between the paired biopsies and prebowel preparation faecal samples were found to be significantly lower than distances between biopsies P 0.03 median distance 0.53 between biopsies n 28 andbetween paired biopsies and prebowel preparation faecal samples n 8.

In our work bowel preparation appears sufficiently to cleanse the lumen to ensure that the luminal contents sampled at colonoscopy--being derived from surfacemucus-adherent microbes rather than the bulk faecal stream--contain a microbial community more similar to that of biopsy samples.Our analysis comparing patient's faecal microbiota pre- and postcolonoscopy indicates that bowel preparation does lead to changes in the faecal microbial community but that these do not appear to occur in a co-ordinated manner.

A significant increase in Faecalibacterium P  0.001 and0.60.40.2significant decreases in Ruminococcus Escherichia Pseudobutyr- ivibrio and Subdoligranulum P  0.001 were found in luminal contents when compared to prebowel preparation faecal samples.

At the phylum level despite some temporary changes as a result of the bowel preparation a significant reduction in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria P  0.001 and an increase in Bacteroidia P 0.014 in luminal contents no significant alterations were found between pre- and postbowel preparation samples.

After the removal of duplicates 17 biopsy samples 16 luminal content samples and 18 swabs taken at colonoscopy 11 prebowel preparation faecal samples and 7 postbowel preparation faecal samples were retained inclusive of 14 complete sets of sample taken at colonoscopy from patients who had undergone bowel preparation.Can Luminal Contents or Swabs Taken During Colonoscopy Act as a Surrogate for Biopsy Samples0.70.5Given the invasive nature of obtaining mucosal biopsy samples a less invasive surrogate sample would prove valuable if observations of the microbial community are sufficiently similar.

GLMs indicated that rectal swabs had significantly increased abundances of Actinobacteria and fusobac- teria P  0.001 compared to paired biopsies.Similarity of Biopsies to Faecal Samples Taken Before Bowel PreparationGiven that luminal contents despite the lower diversity at the time of colonoscopy are more similar than rectal swabs to paired biopsies we sought to determine the similarity of faecal samples taken before bowel preparation versus paired biopsy samples.
