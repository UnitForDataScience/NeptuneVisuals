thus higher donor microbiota diversity may indicate higher donor immunologic tolerance.although the association between high donor diversity and lower gvhd risk remained significant after adjusting for measured donor-based risk factors for example cmv seropositivity and sex match other donor traits for example age and obesity were not collected and thus should be thoroughly examined in follow-up donor studies.

one donor associated with an aggvhd-negative recipient appears to have an outlying phylogenetic diversity pd value of 517 but the association between donor diversity and lower aggvhd odds remains significant with the putative outlier's removal resulting or  0.20 p  0.049. b spearman's correlations between bacterial diversity and taxa relative abundances where blue indicates higher spearman correlation that is taxa enriched in high diversity donors or recipients.

moreover while we have presented speculation on the mechanisms underlying the association between high donor diversity and decreased aggvhd risk future investigations of the donor gut microbiota that aim to characterize causes of donor diversity and to integrate 16s rrna data with immunolo- gical measurements may yield novel insights about the etiology of gvhd.conflict of interestthe authors declare no conflict of interest.acknowledgementswe thank our study participants and clinical staff.

interestingly higher diversity donors harbored higher relative abundances of com- mensal bacteria with evidence for anti-inflammatory effects 3 including bacteria associated with regulatory t cell differentiation for example bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium spp.. pairing donor microbiota profiles with measurements of graft immune cell subsets or investigation of the immune modulatory activities of donor microbiota in vitro may yield more insight into this hypothesis.to our knowledge associations between the donor microbiome and gvhd have only previously been explored in mice.

the absencepresence of a donor microbiota that is whether the donor mouse was germ-free did not affect donor t-cell alloreactivity or gvhd severity.however more nuanced features for example diversity and membership were not evaluated.

we explored associations between aggvhd incidence and1 the diversity and relative abundance of taxa in the baseline recipient microbiota 2 donor-recipient microbiota dissimilarity and 3 the diversity and abundance profiles of the donor microbiota.subjects and methodssubject recruitmentwe prospectively recruited allo-hsct transplant recipients from the university of colorado hospital between 2012 and 2014. if the transplant was sourced from an hla-matched sibling we also recruited the stem cell donor.

taxa relative abun- dances were log-transformed and scaled with the z-transformation to remove order of magnitude differences in interpreting ors and hazard ratios.regression models included adjustment for the following covariatesrecipient age years obesity body mass index 30 versus o30 underlying disease leukemiaother donor sex-match yesno donor cmv status seropositiveseronegative or cordcord donor hla-matched and related yesno and conditioning intensity low reduced and high.

rows taxa at the family resolution were sorted by unsupervised hierarchical clustering euclidean distance.the association between high donor diversity and decreased aggvhd risk is also supportive of our hypothesis that the donor's microbiota may influence gvhd incidence through mechanisms independent of the recipient's microbiota.

measuring donor-patient dissimilarity using unifrac was unin- formative as unifrac was primarily driven by the degree of recipient microbiota 'disturbance' which was in turn not significantly associated with gvhd 3. however this hypothesis may be supported by higher relative abundances of facultative anaerobes like enterococcus and lactobacillus among high diversity donors 3. these species were often enriched in our recipients before conditioning 1 and expand following transplant procedures peri-engraftment and during gvhd onset.thus higher diversity donors may be more immunotolerant of the taxa characteristic of many allo-hsct recipients.ab500400300200coriobacteriales  coriobacteriaceae bacteroidales  rikenellaceae bifidobacteriales  bifidobacteriaceae clostridiales  clostridiaceae bacteroidales  paraprevotellaceae bacteroidales  porphyromonadaceae burkholdeiales  alcaligenaceae erysipelotrichales  erysipelotrichaceae clostridiales  lachnospiraceae clostridiales  ruminococcaceae bacteroidales  bacteroidaceaeverrucomicrobiales  verrucomicrobiaceae clostridiales  veillonellaceae bacteroidales  prevotellaceae enterobacteriales  enterobacteriaceae bacteroidales  s24-7lactobacillales  enterococcaceae lactobacillales  lactobacillaceae lactobacillales  streptococcaceaespearman's correlation 1.00.80.60.40.20.0-0.2-0.4-0.6-0.8-1.0negativepositive aggvhd incidencefigure 4. associations between donor microbiota and aggvhd incidence.

in principle different donor microbiota may promote different compositions of transplanted allo-hsct donor immune cells consequently impacting alloreactivity and gvhd.

it is critical toreexamine this association in broader transplant settings-- particularly as other populations for example recipients with no suitable 'gold standard' donor may benefit most from new donor screening criteria.

we thus hypothesized that the composition and diversity of the donor microbiota itself is associated with gvhd.to examine these three non-competing hypotheses we used 16s rrna gene sequencing to characterize fecal bacterial1department of biostatistics and informatics university of colorado aurora co usa 2department of medicine university of colorado aurora co usa and 3department of medicine university of chicago chicago il usa.
