Coefficient plots extracted from the OPLS-DA models comparing rats receiving a REF diet with C10 diet b REF diet with CF diet and c C10 diet with CF diet.

P  005 v. REF diet  P  005 v. C10 diet  P  005 v. CF diet.Leptin concentration was not affected after the C10 diet but it was up-regulated as a result of the CF diet intake compared with that in the rest of the groups P  005 1.Faecal IgAThe C10 diet intake resulted in a decrease in the secretory IgA concentration compared with that in the other groups P  005 2.

The CF diet did not produce any change in the secreted IgA concentration which was similar to that quantified in the REF group.Urinary metabolic profileAn OPLS-DA model with strong predictive ability Q2Y  093 P  0001 was returned comparing the metabolic profiles from rats receiving the C10 diet and the REF diet 3a and Rats fed the C10 diet excreted cocoa-derived metabolites such as N-methylnicotinic acid NMNA and nicotine mono- nucleotide NMN as well as methylxanthine metabolites that is theobromine xanthine 1-methylxanthine 1-MX 3-methylxanthine 3-MX 7-methylxanthine 7-MX imidazole dimethyluric acid DMU.

Sebacate 4-guanidinobutanoate creatinine allantoin and pseudouridine were also present in lower amounts in the urine samples of C10-fed animals compared with those in the REF group.With regard to the CF diet clear metabolic variation wasobserved in the urine samples of rats fed this diet compared with the samples of those fed the REF diet 3b and OPLS-DA model Q2Y  065 P  0001.

To this effect Wistar rats were fed for 3 weeks a diet containing 10  cocoa C10 or two other diets with same the proportion of fibres one based on cocoa fibre CF and another containing inulin as a reference REF diet.

The C10 group received chow containing 10  cocoa that provided a final diet concentration of 04 polyphenols 085  soluble fibre and 255  insoluble fibre the CF group received a diet with the same cocoa soluble and insoluble fibre proportions as the C10 group but with a very low amount of polyphenols 002  and the REF group received the same amount of fibre as the C10 group with the soluble portion 085  as inulin in order to distinguish the particular effect of cocoa fibre as has been previously reported.

Moreover rats receiving the C10 diet also excreted greater amounts of taurine compared with those receiving the REF diet.

Conversely animals receiving the C10 diet excreted lower amounts of metabolites related to energy metabolism acetone citrate 2-oxoglutarate 2-OG N-methylnicotinamide NMND choline metabolism dimethylamine DMA dime- thylglycine DMG choline and the metabolism of dietary components sucrose glucose tartrate compared with those receiving the REF diet.
