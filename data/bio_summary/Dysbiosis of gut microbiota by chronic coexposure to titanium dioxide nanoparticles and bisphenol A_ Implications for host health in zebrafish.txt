interestingly in females single exposure to nano-tio2 or 2 mgl bpa resulted in significantly higher intestinal levels of serotonin than the controls while coexposure resulted in a comparatively smaller increase b. however compared to the controls exposure to 20 mgl bpa alone did not significantly alter the female intestinal serotonin levels but the coexistence of nano- tio2 and 20 mgl bpa raised the serotonin levels appreciably b.chronic exposure to nano-tio2 alone led to significantly increased expression of the tjp2 protein in male intestines single exposure to bpa did not c. notably the incorporation of 2 mg l bpa in the binary media not only nullified the nano-tio2 induced tjp2 up-regulation but actually led to down-regulation.

significant difference between control and exposure groups is indicated by p  0.05 p  0.01 and p  0.001 while p  0.01 andp  0.001 indicate significant difference between coexposure groups and the corresponding bpa groups without tio2.levels marked down-regulation of tjp2 was detected in the single 20 mgl bpa exposure group but the incorporation of nano-tio2 to the exposure mixture reversed this effect d.decreased levels of il1b were observed in male intestines after exposure to 2 mgl bpa alone or the 2ti binary mixture e. however significantly higher levels of il1b in female intestines were induced by 20 mgl bpa alone or the 20ti binary mixturef.furthermore measurement of various sensitive biomarkers showed that the balance between oxidative stress and detoxifying capacity in the intestines was impaired by single or combined exposure .

phyla of lower relative abundances are pooled in 'others' group.recovery towards control group levels at 88.1 for hyphomicrobium and 0.9 for lawsonia a. although chronic exposure to 20 mgl bpa did not markedly change the generic composition the combination of nano-tio2 and 20 mgl bpa 20ti substantially increased the reproduction of lawsonia 66.4 over hyphomi- crobium 10.4 in view of markedly higher relative abundances of lawsonia a. similar compositional trends were observed in the female intestines where antagonistic effects were observed when both pollutants were combined in the 2ti mixture but syn- ergistic effects were observed for the 20ti mixture b. additionally a significant difference between the 2 mgl bpa and 2ti mixture groups in female intestine was observed for alpha di- versity and richness as characterized by the number of species detected shannon simpson chao1 and ace indices .principal component analysis based on generic abundancethe disrupting influence of exposure to nano-tio2 bpa 0 2 and 20 mgl and their combinations 2ti and 20ti on gut microbiota were elucidated through pca based on the relative abundance of genera .

the arrows indicate the major generic contribution to the variances among samples.impairment of host intestinal healthcompared to the control group chronic exposure to either nano-tio2 or bpa or mixtures of the two did not change the body length of male zebrafish although there were significant differ- ences between the bpa groups and the corresponding mixture groups a. significantly decreased male fish body weight was observed in the 2 mgl bpa group relative to the control b. the male body weights of both binary mixture groups were also significantly different to the respective bpa groups b. a significant decrease in the male condition factor k-factor 14 weight glength cm3 x 100 indicative of fish overall fitness was also noted after exposure to 2 mgl bpa alone c. in female zebrafish there were no significant differences in body length body weight and condition factor data not shown.single exposure to 2 mgl or 20 mgl bpa significantly decreased the serotonin levels in the male intestines.

after two weeks acclimationthe zebrafish were exposed to nano-tio2 100 mgl or bpa 0 2 and 20 mgl individually or in their binary combinations 2ti 2 mg l bpa and nano-tio2 20ti 20 mgl bpa and nano-tio2.

different exposure groups were separated into four categories on the pca1 axis 77.8. for both sexes the 2 mgl bpa group and nano-tio2 group were separated from the control group whereas the binary 2ti group was closer to the control on the pca1 axis  indicative of the antagonistic action of 2 mgl bpa and nano-tio2 when combined at these concentrations.

however the combination of the higher 20 mgl bpa concentration with nano-tio2 further enhanced the up-regulation of tjp2 expression in male intestines c. tjp2 expression in female intestines d was significantly up-regulated upon exposure to either nano-tio2 or 2 mgl bpa alone.

furthermore exposure of males to 2 mg l bpa only led to a higher abundance of actinobacteria 13.9 p  0.001 in the intestinal community relative to the control level at 1.8 a. the binary combination of nano-tio2 and 2 mgl bpa in the 2ti group antagonized these single exposure effects resulting in a microbial profile similar to that of the controls in the male intestines.

however there were still higher abundances of firmicutes 10.3 in the 20ti group despite being statistically nonsignificant a. in the female intestines single exposure to nano-tio2 or 2 mgl bpa elevated the abundance of actinobacteria to 32.2 p  0.001 and 15.7 p  0.001 respectively compared with 3.6 in control intestines whereas exposure to the two binary mixtures resulted in a similar microbial phylic composition to the control group b.at genus level hyphomicrobium was the most abundant genus in the male and female gut in all groups with the exception of the 20ti group which was dominated by lawsonia .

single exposure to either nano-tio2 or 2 mgl bpa depressed the hypho- microbium genus 36.3 and 46.6 respectively p  0.001 but raised the lawsonia genus 8.6 and 22.3 respectively p  0.001 in male intestines whereas exposure to the binary mixture led tofig.

the exact concentrations of bpa in the exposure media 2 mgl 2ti 20 mgl and 20ti groups were previously determined to be 1.4 1.4 20.2 and 19.6 mgl respectively while no bpa was detected in the con- trol group .

adult zebrafish d. rerio were exposed to nano-tio2 100 mgl or bpa 0 2 and 20 mgl or to their binary mixtures for 3 months.

significant difference between control and exposure groups is indicated by p  0.01 and p  0.001 while p  0.05 p  0.01 and p  0.001 indicate significant difference between coexposure groups and the corresponding bpa groups without tio2.while nano-tio2 tended to enhance the toxic effects of 20 mgl bpa.correlation between gut microbiota and fish healthcorrelation analysis demonstrated that the lawsonia genus positively despite not significantly correlated with intestinal ros levels but negatively correlated with cat activity a. compared with the lawsonia genus an inverse relationship withros and cat was observed for the hyphomicrobium genus a. additionally the pseudomonas genus significantly positively correlated with the ros levels in zebrafish intestines a. among the intestinal indices indicative of host health serotonin showed a positive correlation with tjp2 expression.

furthermore nano-tio2 and bpa interacted mutually in an antagonistic manner when bpa was present at a low concentration 2 mgl but in a synergistic manner when bpa was present at a high concentration 20 mgl at least at the level of the microbial composition.
