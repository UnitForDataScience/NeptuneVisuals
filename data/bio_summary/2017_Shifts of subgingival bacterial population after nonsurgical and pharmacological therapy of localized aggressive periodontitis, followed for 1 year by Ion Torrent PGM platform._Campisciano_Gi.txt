case reportshifts of subgingival bacterial population after nonsurgical and pharmacological therapy of localized aggressive periodontitis followed for 1 year by ion torrent pgm platformgiuseppina campisciano12 annamaria toschetti3 manola comar12 rosanna di taranto3federico berton1 claudio stacchi1correspondence dr. claudio stacchi email 1department of medical surgical and health sciences university of trieste trieste italy2advanced diagnostics department institute for maternal and child health irccs burlo garofolo trieste italy3private practice gorizia italyabstractthe possibility of targeting the hypervariable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene using ion torrent personal genome machine pgm could provide a complete analysis of subgingival plaque samples potentially able to identify microbiological species missed by culture-based methods.

an accurate definition of the shifts of the bacterial community might help periodontal researchers for a better understanding of the impact of different treatment approaches or in intercepting nonresponsive conditions.key words anaerobic bacteria full-mouth disinfection ion torrent personal genome machine localized aggressive periodontitis nonsurgical treatmentintroductionlocalized and generalized aggressive periodontitis show different clinical features12 being also characterized by slightly diverse bacterial profiles in the subgingival microbiota.34 the etiology of both diseases is widely thought to be polymicrobial56but the role of individual species and their complex interactions with the host have not been clearly defined yet.

template preparation was performed using the ion pgm template ot2 200 kit on ion onetouchtm 2 system life technologies gran island new york usa after which the enrichment percentage was carried out on qubitr 2.0 fluorometer.

the templates were sequenced on the ion pgmtm system machine using the ion pgm sequencing 200 kit v2 life technologies new york usa.sequence data analysis qiime 1.8.0 knight lab boulder colorado usa was used to process the sequence data.

it is interesting to note that the bacterial shift toward a higher prevalence of pathogen species was not accompanied by clinical signs of inflammation microbiological analysis seems to predict the necessity of further therapies before the clinical scenario becomes evident.figure 2 periapical radiographs comparing baseline condition upper line with the situation 1 year after nonsurgical and pharmacological therapy lower linethe main advantage of the ion torrent pgm platform is basically due to the high throughput of the technique able to identify microbiological species missed by culture-based method.
