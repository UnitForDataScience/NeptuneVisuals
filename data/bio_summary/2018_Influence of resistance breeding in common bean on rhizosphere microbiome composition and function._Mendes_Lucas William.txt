The ADE soils are anthropogenic horizons built-up by the Pre-Colombian Indians between 500 and 8700 years ago and they are characterized by their high fertility and high microbial diversity The AGR was collected in an experimental area of the 'Luiz de Queiroz' College of Agriculture ESALQ USP Piracicaba Brazil located at Anhembi muni- cipality Sao Paulo Brazil 22deg40'S and 48deg10'W.

Microorganisms inhabiting the rhizo- sphere may provide a range of beneficial functions for the host plant in particular nutrient acquisition stress tolerance and protection against soil-borne pathogens The bulk soil is the main source of microbial species colonizing the rhizo- sphere and the plant genotype drives in part the selection of the microorganisms by depositing specific exudates in the soil-root interface Hence plant species cultivars and soil type are key drivers ofrhizosphere microbiome composition and function- ing .Over the past decades plant breeders have exploited plant genetic traits to improve plant growth and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses .

The resistance is quantitatively inher- ited and influenced by environmental conditions .

The ADE soil was collected at the Hatahara site located within the Amazon basin near Iranduba-Manaus Brazil 03deg16'S and 60deg12'W.

The AGR soil is characterized as oxisol and this area has been used for agricultural experiments with common bean and corn.

The results of macro and micronutrients allowed the calculation of exchangeable bases SB the sum of Ca Mg and K cation exchange capacity the sum of Ca Mg K Al and H base saturation V the percentage relation between SB and cation exchange capacity and Al saturation m the percentage relation between exchangeable Al and cation exchange capacity.

The texture of the soil samples was determined using Bouyoucos densimeter after shaking the soil vigorously with NaOH 1 M as dispersant.

The choice of the common bean cultivars was based on levels of genetic resistance to Fox Supplementary Table 1 and the seeds were provided by the Agronomic Institute of Campinas IAC Campinas Sao Paulo.
