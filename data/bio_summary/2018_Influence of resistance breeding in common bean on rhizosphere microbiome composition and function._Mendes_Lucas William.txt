microorganisms inhabiting the rhizo- sphere may provide a range of beneficial functions for the host plant in particular nutrient acquisition stress tolerance and protection against soil-borne pathogens the bulk soil is the main source of microbial species colonizing the rhizo- sphere and the plant genotype drives in part the selection of the microorganisms by depositing specific exudates in the soil-root interface hence plant species cultivars and soil type are key drivers ofrhizosphere microbiome composition and function- ing .over the past decades plant breeders have exploited plant genetic traits to improve plant growth and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses .

it is important to note that a pathogen invader may manage to displace the key taxa and collapse the network structure .conclusionsthe importance of the rhizosphere microbiome in the plant ecosystem functioning has been widely recognized but traditional approaches of plant breeding do not take the plant microbiome into account.

our results reinforce the importance of understanding the genetic and bio chemical mechanisms involved in the interplay between soil type plant genotype rhizosphere microbiome plant growth and plant health.

our findings suggest that breeding for fox resistance in common bean may have co-selected for other unknown plant traits that support a higher abundance of specific beneficial bacterial families in the rhizosphere with functional traits that reinforce the first line of defense.the isme journal 2018 12 212-224 published online 13 october 2017introductionthe rhizosphere microbiome that is the totality of microorganisms their genomes and interactions in the rhizosphere has been the focus of numerous studies to resolve its role in plant growth and health .

overall the rhizosphere effect was stronger in the agr soil supplementary tables4 and 5. these changes are most likely due to several processes occurring at the root-soil interface during plant development including the release of exudates uptake of water and nutrients and root respiration in addition the nutrient availability in rhizosphere is controlled by interactions among soil properties plant character- istics and microbial activity.

although fox resistance is based on plant genetic traits our data support the hypothesis that breeding for resistance may have unintentionally altered the rhizosphere microbiome composition altering the frequency of beneficial microorganisms and traits that may contribute to plant growth or assist in protection against the pathogen.

in this context stated that future breeding programs should evaluate plant lines for their broad interaction with soil microorganisms.

previous studies on the microbial basis of disease suppressive soils already showed that plants rely at least in part on the rhizosphere microbiome as a first line of defense against pathogen invasion correspondence lw mendes cell and molecular biology laboratory center for nuclear energy in agriculture cena university of sao paulo usp avenida centenario 303 piracicaba sao paulo 13400-970 brazil.e-mail received 16 september 2016 revised 21 june 2017 accepted 24june 2017 published online 13 october 2017 a recent study has shown that the phytohormone salicylic acid modulates colonization of arabidopsis roots by specific bacterial taxa illustrating how plant defense pathways impact on the rhizosphere microbiome composition .

although a decrease of iron and calcium in the rhizosphere is common accumulation owing to exudates and microbial solubilization may occur at some plant develop- mental stage in addition to these chemical alterations the taxonomic composition and functional profile of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of all bean cultivars was different from that of the bulk soil exemplifying the well-known rhizosphere effect.

in a previous study we showed that soybean plants are able to recruit microbial taxa based on the functional cores related to benefits for the plant such as growth promotion and nutrition .

in a recent study demonstrated that variation in lignin biosynthesis modulates the composition of the plant endosphere microbiome.
