Following peroral challenge with a clinical P. aeruginosa isolate on two consecutive days mice harboring a human or murine microbiota were only partially protected from stable intestinal P. aeruginosa colonization given that up to 78 of mice were P. aeruginosa-positive at day 28 post-infection p.i.. Irrespective of the host-specificity of the microbiota P. aeruginosa colonized mice were clinically uncompromised.

However despite observed pro-inflammatory immune responses with pronounced intestinal epithelial apoptosis sequelae of intestinal MDR P. aeruginosa carriage was not sufficient enough to drive gut microbiota shifts towards overgrowth with potentially pro-inflammatory commensals.CONCLUSIONOur study demonstrates that in with a complex microbiota reconstituted secondary abiotic mice the established intestinal microbiota irrespective whether of human or murine origin does not sufficiently prevent the host from intestinal colonization with a MDR P. aeruginosa strain.

This is even more surprising given that not all mice under investigation were stable P. aeruginosa carriers further underlining the pathogenic potential of MDR P. aeruginosa.Despite several reports of diarrhea caused by P. aeruginosa in patients with prior antibiotic treatment P. aeruginosa is not regarded as a common intestinal pathogen in the healthy host    .

aeruginosa by clinically unaffected mice results in pro-inflammatory sequelae not only in intestinal but also systemic compartments.Keywords multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria intestinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization fecal microbiota transplantation human microbiota associated mice colonization resistance host-pathogen- interaction intestinal and systemic sequelae of colonization broad-spectrum antibiotic treatmentINTRODUCTIONPseudomonas aeruginosa constitute strictly aerobic Gram- negative bacteria that normally inhabit the soil and surfaces in aqueous environments.

Experiments were reproduced at least twice.RESULTSIntestinal P. aeruginosa Colonization in Mice Harboring a Complex Human vs. Murine Gut MicrobiotaIn the present study we addressed whether a complex human or murine gut microbiota could sufficiently confer colonization resistance against MDR P. aeruginosa to the vertebrate host and if not whether intestinal P. aeruginosa carriage resulted in intestinal or even systemic inflammatory sequelae.

Until the end of the observation period however fecal P. aeruginosa loads were comparable in mice with either microbiota whereas64.7 of mice following human FMT and 77.8 of murine controls harbored the bacterial strain in their intestinal tract at day 28 p.i.

aeruginosa colonization increased innate immune cell subsets could be observed in the large intestines of mice harboring either a human or murine gut microbiota whereas this held true for adaptive immune cells such as B lymphocytes in the small and large intestinal tract of mice with a murine microbiota rather later in the course of P. aeruginosa colonization.Intestinal Cytokine Responses uponP.

Prior infection the P. aeruginosa strain was grown on cetrimide agar Oxoid for 48 h in an aerobic atmosphere at 37C.On days 0 and 1 mice were perorally challenged with 109 CFUof the MDR P. aeruginosa strain by gavage in a total volume of0.3 mL PBS as reported earlier  .For quantitative assessment of fecal P. aeruginosa loads over time p.i.

However no data are available whether P. aeruginosa carriage particularly of a MDR strain results in distinct host immune responses.This prompted us to investigate whether mice harboring a human vs. murine gut microbiota could be stably colonized by a clinical MDR P. aeruginosa strain and whether opportunistic pathogenic carriage was associated with intestinal or even systemic inflammatory host responses.

aeruginosa Colonization of Mice Harboring a Complex Human vs. Murine Gut MicrobiotaWe next addressed whether changes in intestinal innate and adaptive immune cell numbers upon P. aeruginosa colonization of human vs. murine fecal microbiota transplanted mice was accompanied by pro- andor anti-inflammatory cytokine responses within the intestinal tract.
