surprisingly some mabs from naive b cells or anti-influenza plasma- blasts also bound microbiota and resembled iga mabs though these were found more rarely at a frequency of 30. dose titration suggested that microbiota-reactive mabs regardless of or- igin were moderate to low affinity fig.

initial experiments indicated that most iga-derived mabs bound mi- crobiota consistent with their intestinal pc ori- gin whereas most mabs from naive splenic b2 cells peritoneal b1b or anti-influenza human plasmablasts did not fig.

together these data indicate that iga- derived mabs recapitulate the binding patterns of endogenous igas that coat the microbiota.notably naturally microbiota-reactive mabs from naive b cells showed the same patterns of microbiota binding by 16s sequencing as those derived from igas and also selectively stained endogenously iga-coated microbiota fig.

3 mabs were assigned a microbiota-reactivity per- centile score based on a control distribution of the 47 splenic b2 or 27 anti-influenza mabs shown in fig.

5 mabs were classi- fied categorically as high microbiota-reactivity if their percentile score was 70 and low microbiota- reactivity if their percentile score was 70. this cutoff was selected based on the observation that mabs with scores of 70 showed reactivity that was reproducibly above background.purification of mab-bound or unbound microbiotasmall intestinal contents from two or more 6- to 20-week-old rag1-- mice were isolated by run- ning forceps along the length of the intestinal tissue pooled and placed into a 2 ml eppendorf biopur tube on ice.

however despite its abundance the specificity of homeostatic iga has long remained elusive.rationale to elucidate the specificity and origins of homeostatic iga we performed un- biased large-scale cloning and characterization of monoclonal antibodies mabs from single murine iga plasma cells and other b cell popu- lations of different origins.
