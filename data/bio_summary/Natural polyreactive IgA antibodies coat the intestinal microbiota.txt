Email and origins of IgA responses with an unbiased large-scale analysis of mAbs derived from mu- rine IgA PC populations and other B cell subsets.Microbiota-reactivity and polyreactivity of mAbs from IgA PCs or naiveB cell subsetsWe first sought to establish the frequency of microbiota-reactive specificities within the reper- toire of murine small intestinal lamina propria SI IgA PCs compared with naive B cell popu- lations that express IgM and IgD.

Initial experiments indicated that most IgA-derived mAbs bound mi- crobiota consistent with their intestinal PC ori- gin whereas most mAbs from naive splenic B2 cells peritoneal B1b or anti-influenza human plasmablasts did not fig.

Surprisingly some mAbs from naive B cells or anti-influenza plasma- blasts also bound microbiota and resembled IgA mAbs though these were found more rarely at a frequency of 30.

All mAbs were expressed as monomers with murine variable regions and human IgG1-Igk con- stant regions except anti-influenza mAbs which had fully human varia-39F1012293D743G1015305E7High Microbiota- reactivity mAbsLow Microbiota-3 DNA2100.01 0.113 Albumin23 Insulin2100.01 0.1 13 Cardiolipin23 LPS2100.01 0.1 13 KLH23 Flagellin2100.01 0.1 1 3H943B6 Polyreactiveble regions.

Together these data indicate that IgA- derived mAbs recapitulate the binding patterns of endogenous IgAs that coat the microbiota.Notably naturally microbiota-reactive mAbs from naive B cells showed the same patterns of microbiota binding by 16S sequencing as those derived from IgAs and also selectively stained endogenously IgA-coated microbiota Fig.
