Clustering was based on BSAHN software following the unweighted pair group method algorithm UPGMA.Phospholipid fatty acid analysis of the aged landfill leachate microbiotaPLFA analysis of the mixed microbial population of the aged landfill leachate was performed by extracting membrane lipids through the implementation of the Bligh and Dyer method  and methyl esterification Ntougias et al.

Landfill leachate is a wastewater formed inside a san- itary landfill site and is considered an important environmen- tal issue due to the recalcitrant nature of the organic matter Fernandes et al.

Landfill leachate contains several or- ganic and inorganic groups of pollutants with broad variation in their chemical structures depending on the age and the nature of the wastes present in the landfill the climate factors humidity and rainfall rates and the selected landfilling tech- nique Di Iaconi et al.

By proceeding the sta- bilization process through landfill site maturation recalcitrant humic and fulvic compounds of high molecular weight and low biodegradability remain in the soluble fraction of the landfill leachate thus resulting in BOD5COD values below0.1 Di Iaconi et al.

At this stage the stabilized leachate is characterized by low BOD5 high ammonium concentration and an increasing toxicity which further compromises the biological processes Bashir et al.

.Despite the fact that some research has been carried out in the past decade on the treatment of mature landfill leachate regarding the appropriate method for carbon and nitrogen re- moval Yapsakli et al.

Identification of their closest rela- tives was performed through BLAST search and sequence alignment was conducted by Clustal Omega Sievers et al.. MEGA6 Tamura et al.

At this stage humic substrates appear to be among the major organic compounds identified in the landfill leachate Kjeldsen et al.
