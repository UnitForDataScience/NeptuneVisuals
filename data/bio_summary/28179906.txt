Therefore although these findings are in contrast with previous observa- tions showing a protective role of NLRP3 during colitis  both highlight the relevance of NLRP3-enteric microbiota interplay in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.Non-Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome ActivationBesides canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation over the last years a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation has been proposed also for non-canonical caspase- 11-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

In addition given the relevance of intestinal microbiota in caspase-11 activation extensive investigations are needed to evaluate whether changes in enteric bacteria composition could influence caspase-11 activity and consequent non-canonical inflammasome assembly.PHARMACOLOGiCAL MODULATiON OF NLRP3 iNFLAMMASOMe iN BOweL iNFLAMMATiONThe involvement of inflammasome pathways in the patho- physiology of intestinal inflammation is fostering research on the potential therapeutic benefits in terms of anti-inflammatory activity resulting from the pharmacological targeting of NLRP3 inflammasome.

Moreover special attention has been paid to the pharmacological modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome emphasizing the concept that this multiprotein complex could represent a suitable target for the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.Keywords canonical non-canonical NLRP3 bowel inflammation intestinal homeostasis immune system enteric microbiotaiNTRODUCTiONA growing body of evidence highlights the relevance of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of several autoinflammatory syndromes i.e.

Inaddition a non- canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation which depends on caspase-11 in mice human orthologs are caspase 4 and caspase 5 has been described to be pivotal in the maintenance of intes- tinal immune homeostasis .Several lines of preclinical evidence have unraveled a dual role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of bowel inflam- mation .

In this context research efforts are currently being focused on a better understanding of the role of canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation.Based on the above background the present review has been intended to provide an integrated and critical appraisal of the available knowledge about the protective or detrimental role of canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis as well as in sustaining the pathophysiological events underlying bowel inflammation.

Special attention has been paid to point out how NLRP3 inflammasome influences the dynamic interplay between microbiota intestinal epithelium and innate immune system as well as how the pharmacological modulation of this enzymatic complex could represent a suitable strategy in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases IBDs.MeCHANiSMS OF CANONiCAL AND NON-CANONiCAL NLRP3 iNFLAMMASOMe ACTivATiONCanonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two paral- lel and independent steps transcription and oligomerization  .

Accordingly current data on the involvement of canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 pathways in the pathophysiology of bowel inflammation are addressed in the following section.Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome ActivationIn an attempt of understanding the role of canonical NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of bowel inflammation several efforts have been made to implement research on the effects of NLRP3 gene deletion and its components on immune and non-immune cell activity as well as on pathophysiological events downstream its activation in preclinical models of colitis see .

Taken together these findings suggest that caspase-11 via non-canonical inflammasome activation regulates mucosal and epithelial barrier integrity during intestinal inflammation by increasing epithelial cell proliferation and inhibiting cell death .The protective role of caspase-11-induced non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been shown in a model of Gram-negative C. rodentium infection-induced colitis .

suggested that sensitivity to DSS colitis in Casp11-- mice is independent from caspase-1-induced canonical inflammasome activation since the colonic levels of IL-1b and IL-18 as well as circulating HMGB1in DSS Casp11-- mice did not differ from DSS WT mice sug-gesting that caspase-11 protects against colitis independently from inflammasome activation and therefore hypothesizing an unidentified pathway for caspase-11 in bowel inflammation  .

For instance since caspase-11 is activated by Gram-negative bacteria changes in gut microbiota composition could i influence hypo- or hyper-activation of caspase-11-induced non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome ii alter basal IFN production   with subsequent changes in caspase-11 expression andor function or iii trigger yet unidentified molecular NLRP3-independent pathways involved in the pathophysiology of gut inflammation.DiscussionCurrent data allow to hypothesize that NLRP3 inflammasome can play both protective and detrimental roles in bowel inflam- mation depending on the choice of colitis models and variations of commensal enteric microflora.
