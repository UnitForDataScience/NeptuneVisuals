Further work is warranted in a larger patient cohort utilizing next generation sequencing plat- forms to achieve better microbiota profiling together with histo- logical analyses of explanted sphenoid sinus and pituitary tissue.ConclusionIn this preliminary study we characterised the sphenoid sinus mucosal microbiota in patients with PA and compared findings to a control group comprising of surgically treated NFPAs.

This article is an open access publicationAbstractPurpose There is a high incidence of abnormal sphenoid sinus changes in patients with pituitary apoplexy PA. Their pathophysiology is currently unexplored and may reflect an inflammatory or infective process.

In this preliminary study we characterised the microbiota of sphenoid sinus mucosa in patients with PA and compared findings to a control group of surgically treated non-functioning pituitary adenomas NFPAs.Methods In this prospective observational study of patients undergoing trans-sphenoidal surgery for PA or NFPA sphe- noid sinus mucosal specimens were microbiologically pro- filed through PCR-cloning of the 16S rRNA gene.Results Ten patients five with PA and five with NFPAs with a mean age of 51 years range 23-71 were included.

Differences in the sphenoid sinus microbiota of the PA and NFPA groups were observed.

PA is presumed to be a sponta- neous vascular event and risk factors include anticoagulant therapy major surgery dopamine agonist therapy pregnancy and radiation therapy .We and others have observed a high incidence of abnor- mal sphenoid sinus changes in PA .

In a recent study we noted that sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening SSMT was present in 62 of PA patients compared to just 6 of a con- trol group of non-functioning pituitary adenomas NFPAs .

The aetiology of SSMT in PA is unknown and possibili- ties include inflammation or infection.In this preliminary study we sought to characterise the sphenoid sinus mucosal microbiota in patients with PA and compare them to a control group comprising surgically treated NFPAs.MethodsThis was a prospective single-center observational study.

Overall differences were observed between the sphenoid sinus microbiota of the PA and NFPA groups Table .

One NFPA patient Case N4 was found to harbour Streptococ- cus pneumoniae only and had evidence of asymptomatic sphenoid sinus disease preoperatively.DiscussionCompositional differences in the sinus microbiota between patients with and without PA have not been reported previ- ously.
