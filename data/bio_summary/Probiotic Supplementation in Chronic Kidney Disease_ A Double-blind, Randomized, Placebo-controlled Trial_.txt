Consequently the disruption of the epithelial barrier facilitates the transloca- tion of uremic toxins and other microbial substances from the gut lumen into the systemic circulation resulting in worsening of systemic inflammation.At baseline a negative correlation between the average number of bands and predialysis urea plasma levels was found suggesting indirect evidence of the role of biochem- ical milieu in modulating the gut microbiome.In a previous study published by our group a negative association between the average number of bands and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 plasma levels was observed in nondialysis CKD patients suggesting a possible relationship between gut microbiota and cardiovascular risk in CKD patients.Ureolytic bacteria belong to both symbiotic and patho- genic microbiota.

2012showed that human enterocytes incu- bated with uremic plasma showed depletion of claudin-1 and occludin key components of the junctional complex of the gut barrier which confirms the role of uremia in the dysfunction of gut barrier components.Our results also show a significant increase in IS plasma levels after probiotic supplementation which could be a consequence of increased permeability of the gut barrier al- lowing greater diffusion of uremic toxins from the gut lumen into the bloodstream.

Over the next years the authors hope that studies have results about strategies capable of reestablishing the gut's biochemical environment to provide more favorable conditions for the maintenance of a balanced intestinal microbiota and healthy colonic epithelium.In view of our results and considering the peculiarities of CKD patients it is plausible to consider that a prebiotic or symbiotic supplementation can promote a synergistic ac- tion and to be more effective to modulate the gut dysbiosis in CKD patients.

Prebiotics may contribute to modulation of the gut microbiota and to improve the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier decreasing uremic toxins production and attenuating local and systemic inflammation thus promoting a more favorable scenario for the introduction of probiotic microorganisms.Besides the prebiotics other therapeutic strategies for have already emerged to improve the gut imbalance in CKD such as physical exerciseand the use of oral adsorbents.The present study presents a number of limitations.

However complexities in the composition of the gut microbiota in CKD patients should be taken into account when strains are given to these patients as a strategy to reestablish the gut microbiota equilibrium.

These au- thors believe that a larger long-term and crossover with a washout study is crucial to better characterize the probi- otics effects.summarizes the hypothetical effects of probiotic supplementation in CKD patients according to the results observed in this study emphasizing that many other factors should be considered.ConclusionsIn conclusion the importance that gut microbiota has in CKD is clear as are the deadlocks associated with the use of probiotics in this population.

Further studies addressing probiotic therapy in chronic kidney disease patients are needed.c 2017 by the National Kidney Foundation Inc.

Thus the present study evaluated the effects of a probiotic formulation on the biochemical and inflammatory parameters uremic toxins levels and gut microbiota profile in CKD patients on hemodialysis HD.MethodsRecruitment of ParticipantsForty-six HD patients were included in this randomized double blind placebo-controlled study 23 received probi- otic supplement and 23 received placebo.

Global health organizations such as World Health Organization attribute health bene- fits to this approach.Over recent years researchers have supported the hypothesis that probiotics may be a promising adjuvant therapy for CKDgiven the role of the gut microbiota alterations in uremic toxicity and systemic inflammation.Some studies have shown benefits of probiotic supple- mentation in CKD patients.

The P value is reflecting the differences of the vari- ables between baseline and after intervention moment in each group.Thus probiotic supplementation may have failed to pro- mote benefits in this study because of the unfavorable envi- ronment in which such strains were introduced.In parallel CKD patients present factors that impair the maintenance of the gut pH within the proper range mak- ing it less acid.
