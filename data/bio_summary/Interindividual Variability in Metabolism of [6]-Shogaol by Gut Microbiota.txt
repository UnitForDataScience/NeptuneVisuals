Thus mechanismspathways underlying observed biological effects of 6S remain unclear.Metabolism of 6S in mice showed that 6S and its metabolites phase I metabolites and thiol conjugates were excreted into urine mainly in a glucuronidated form while being present in fecal samples in free forms.We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiota may play an important role in the metabolism of 6S converting inactive glucuronated 6S and its metabolites to bioactive free molecules leading to exposure of colon tissues to a relatively high concentration of bioactive molecules including 6S and its phase I metabolites as well as its thiol conjugates.

Our laboratory has previously established that 6S was extensively metabolized to its phase I metabolites such as 1-4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl-4-decen-3-ol M6 5- methoxy-1-4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl-decan-3-one M7metabolites including 5-cysteinyl-M6 M1 5-cysteinyl-6- shogaol M2 5-cysteinylglycinyl-M6 M3 5-N-acetylcystein- yl-M6 M4 and 5-N-acetylcysteinyl-6-shogaol M5.- We have also proved that the phase I and thiol conjugated metabolites of 6S remain bioactive and in the blood circulation most of them were transported in their glucuronidated forms.-We recently further revealed that the glucuronida- tion of 6S can largely eliminate its bioactivities.

6S was incubated with fecal slurries to yield microbial metabolites which were analyzed by HPLC-ECD and LC-MS. shows the representative HPLC-ECD chromatograms for 6S and its microbial metabolites obtained from subject-1.

We have previously reported M9 and M11 as the metabolites of 6S in liver microsomes.To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of M9 and M11 as the microbial-derived metabolites of 6S.

The presence of 6S and its metabolites M1-M12 were confirmed by comparing their respective retention times and tandem mass data with those of the authentic standards as described previously.-The profiles of metabolites were also similar to that from 6S-treated mouse fecal samples suggesting a b- glucuronidase-like activity of the gut microbiota.

Studies have revealed that ginger phytochemicals upon oral administration underwent enter- ohepatic recirculation in mice.We hypothesize that in the gastrointestinal tract especially in the colon the glucuronidated forms of 6S and its metabolites phase I and thiol-conjugatedmetabolites can be deconjugated andor further metabolized by gut microbiota.To test this hypothesis the metabolic fates of 6S and its metabolites in the mouse intestinal tract were studied.

And two major metabolites M9 and M11 were identified as the microbial-derived metabolites.

We also demonstrated that the glucuronides of 6S and its metabolites could be rapidly deconjugated by human gut microbiota and in mouse gastrointestinal track releasing bioactive free forms of 6S and its metabolites.
