Nevertheless we detected a significantly increased beta diversity in the microbiota of H compared with the H- counterpart together with compositional changes in the gut microbiota of H H- and and Ht subjects thus indicating a distinct effect of both helminth infection and continued prophylactic treatment on the host gut microbiota.

This aspect deserves further investigation using pre-defined and standardised experimental set-ups.Whilst we detected no differences in overall bacterial richness and alpha diversity between H H- and Ht groups beta diversity was significantly increased in H and Ht subjects when each of these groups were individually compared to the uninfected H- cohort.

A helminth-positive H and helminth-negative H- B regularly treated Ht and H- and C H and Ht subjects.Differentially abundant faecal bacteria in helminth-positive H helminth-negative H- and helminth-negative but regularly treated Ht subjects based on LDA Effect Size LEfSe analysis.

While this observation supports the findings from a previous study carried out in a cohort of human volunteers experimentally infected with N. americanus  an investigation of the impact of naturally acquired helminth infections on the composition of the gut microbiota of a cohort of Ecuadorean children  resulted in contrasting results.Indeed while sole infections by T. trichiura could not be associated with detectable changes in microbial richness and alpha diversity the gut microbiota of subjects with concomitant infec- tions by T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides displayed a notable decrease of the latter .

Beta diversity was calculated using weighted UniFrac distances and differences in beta diversity were calculated using PERMDISP PermutationalAnalysis of Multivariate Dispersions through the betadisper function .

Clearly this data requires experimental vali- dation using comprehensive metabolomics studies of the gut microbiota of helminth-infected hosts during acute and chronic infections.ConclusionData from this study augments current knowledge of the effect that helminth infections and continued prophylactic treatment exert on the composition of the gut microbiota of the human host.

However 'lipid metabolism' P  0.003 'rig-like receptor signalling pathway' P  0.024 and 'apoptosis' P  0.04 were down-regulated in H com- pared with H-Ht subjects while the 'biotin pathway' was upregulated in H compared with H-Ht P  0.008 .DiscussionIn this study we analysed the effects of patent infections by parasitic helminths as well as of repeated prophylactic administrations of anthelmintics on the composition of the faecalmicrobiota of human volunteers from endemic areas of Sri Lanka.
