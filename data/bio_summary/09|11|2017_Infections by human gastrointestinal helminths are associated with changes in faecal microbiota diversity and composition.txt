While this observation supports the findings from a previous study carried out in a cohort of human volunteers experimentally infected with N. americanus  an investigation of the impact of naturally acquired helminth infections on the composition of the gut microbiota of a cohort of Ecuadorean children  resulted in contrasting results.Indeed while sole infections by T. trichiura could not be associated with detectable changes in microbial richness and alpha diversity the gut microbiota of subjects with concomitant infec- tions by T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides displayed a notable decrease of the latter .

Nevertheless we detected a significantly increased beta diversity in the microbiota of H compared with the H- counterpart together with compositional changes in the gut microbiota of H H- and and Ht subjects thus indicating a distinct effect of both helminth infection and continued prophylactic treatment on the host gut microbiota.

Beta diversity was calculated using weighted UniFrac distances and differences in beta diversity were calculated using PERMDISP PermutationalAnalysis of Multivariate Dispersions through the betadisper function .

This aspect deserves further investigation using pre-defined and standardised experimental set-ups.Whilst we detected no differences in overall bacterial richness and alpha diversity between H H- and Ht groups beta diversity was significantly increased in H and Ht subjects when each of these groups were individually compared to the uninfected H- cohort.

Clearly this data requires experimental vali- dation using comprehensive metabolomics studies of the gut microbiota of helminth-infected hosts during acute and chronic infections.ConclusionData from this study augments current knowledge of the effect that helminth infections and continued prophylactic treatment exert on the composition of the gut microbiota of the human host.

Briefly the V3-V4 region was PCR-amplified using universal primers  that contained the Illumina adapter overhang nucleotide sequences using the NEBNext hot start high-fidelity DNA polymerase New England Biolabs and the following thermocy- cling protocol using DNA 2ngml 2 min at 98C 20 cycles of 15 s at 98C- 30 s at 63C- 30 s at 72C and a final elongation of 5 min at 72C.

Differences in bacterial alpha diversity Shannon diversity and richness between groups as well as in the abundance of individual taxa were evaluated using paired t-test.

The spe- cific groups of lactic acid bacteria shown to be associated with helminth infection are inconsis- tent between this and previous studies which could be linked to host-specific responses to parasites nevertheless in the future studies of parasite-microbiota interactions conducted onlarger human andor animal cohorts should particularly focus on this group of probiotics  .In order to correlate data on the composition of the human gut microbiota in response to helminth infection and anthelmintic treatment to inferred changes in bacterial metabolism we conducted a predictive metagenomics analysis using PICRUSt.

The pellets were then emulsified using saturated sucrose solution mixed thoroughly and centrifuged for 20 min at 2045 g. Approximately 5 ml of the top meniscus of the resulting suspensions were collected in a centrifuge tube mixed with distilled water up to a final volume of 15 ml and centrifuged for 10 min at 1370 g. This procedure was repeated and 1 ml of eachsuspension with the pellet was transferred to 1.5 ml eppendorf1 tubes using a Pasteur pipette.

Helminth eggs were identified using established morphological keys .DNA extraction and bacterial 16S rRNA Illumina sequencingGenomic DNA was extracted directly from each sample as well as from two negative no- DNA template controls using the PowerSoil1 DNA Isolation Kit MO BIO Laboratories Carlsbad CA USA according to manufacturers' instructions within 1 month from collec- tion.
