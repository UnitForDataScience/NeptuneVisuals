therefore we decided to provide sequences only up to genus level.identification of mucor species by pyrosequencingin each sample where the mucor genus was detected in the initial pyrosequencing analysis we created a custom dna sequencing library specific for mucor spp.

no correlation was observed between mucor and total cholesterol figure 2.in this context mucor ra was negatively associated with cimt of right common carotid artery r-0.38 p0.025 left common carotid artery r-0.37 p0.03 common carotid arteries r-0.40 p0.02 and mean value of all carotid segments r-0.44 p0.01 fdr0.032 figure 2 and supplementary table s2.interestingly among subjects with detectable mucor spp.

three prevalent species were identified mucor racemosus 64.3 mucor circineloides 21.5 and mucor fuscus 14.2. correlation analysis by spearman's rank correlation indicated that m. racemosus ra was significantly and negatively correlated with cimt of left common carotid artery r-0.34 p0.05 both common carotid arteries r-035 p0.034 and mean value of all carotid segments r-0.38 p0.027 figure 3a.

fungibelonging to genera xenomyces and saccharomyces were also related to framingham 10-year risk score r-0.35 p0.043 and r-0.36 p0.034 respectively.finally the ra of fungi belonging to genus cladosporium was found to be directly associated with serum cholesterol r0.34 p0.049 fdr0.4 and ldl-cholesterol levelsr0.38 p0.050 figure 2. the ra of the genus eurotium was associated with hba1c r0.34 p0.048 and fasting glucose r0.35 p0.037.association of gut mycobiota with cardiovascular parameters at the species level the importance of mucor racemosusgiven the favourable associations observed with the presence of mucor spp.

from all taxa identified the relative abundance of the phylum zygomycota comprising the family mucoraceae and genus mucor was negatively associated with cimt and this association remained significant after controlling for false discovery rate.

obese subjects with detectable mucor spp.

interestingly the relative abundance of mucor racemosus was negatively associated both with frs and cimt.

partial least square discriminant analyses modelling evaluating the potential relevance of gut mycobiota in patients stratified by mean values of cimt showed that even a 1 component model had a high accuracy 0.789 with a high r2 value 0.51. variable importance in projection scores showed that m. racemosus abundance had the same impact in the model as waist-to-hip ratio high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol fasting triglycerides or fasting glucose suggesting that m. racemosus relative abundance in the gut may be a relevant biomarker for cardiovascular risk.keywords mycobiota mucor racemosus cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis pyrosequencing obesity intestinalintroductionatherosclerosis is the main cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide and is characterised by the progressive accumulation of lipids in the intima layer of arterial walls of large- and medium-sized arteries.

two-way anova followed by bonferroni post hoc comparison test prism 5 software graphpad software inc. san diego ca usa was used to assess differences on metabolic changes by mucor spp.

by contrast the ra of fungi belonging to family davidiellaceae were positively related to ldl-cholesterol r0.36 p0.036 and serum cholesterol r0.40 p0.02 while family saccharomycetaceae ra was positively associated with cimt of the right common carotid artery r0.37 p0.03 supplementary table s2.association of gut mycobiota with cardiovascular parameters at the genus levelthe ra of fungi belonging to penicillium and mucor genera were negatively associated with fasting triglycerides r- 0.39 p0.022 fdr0.055 and r-0.43 p0.01 respectively with a fdr for the latter 0.032 figure 2 and supplementary table s2.

mucor ra was also positively associated with hdl-cholesterol r0.39 p0.022 fdr0.065 figure 2 hdl-cholesterolldl-cholesterol ratio r0.52 p0.002 and negative with ldl-cholesterol r-0.33 p0.06 supplementary table s2.

framingham 10-year risk r-0.36 p0.056 and frs r-0.33 p0.055 werealso negatively associated with mucor.

supplementary figure s1 no significant differences between obese and non-obese subjects were observed they had similar frs and cimt in all carotid segments table 2. by contrast obese subjects with undetectable mucor spp.
