a better characterization of the envir- onmental constraints and of the other micro-organisms for example bacteria will allow us to better understand and model network connectivity and species interactions within such freshwater aquatic ecosystem overall our analyses of the network of commu- nities revealed several types of communities with a clear transition from communities of the non-potable water sources to a diversity of compositionally distinct communities in street gutters.

on the contrary gm communities showed high variability among samples highlighting that gm samples can be very dissimilar to each other and that a fraction of the gm samples tended to be more similar to rw or fw samples than to gm samples fi.

we then com- pared the street gutter mat gm communities to the non-potable water sources nps corresponding to fw and rw samples.analyses of the otus that are specific to the water sources or to the street gutters revealed 1118 otus only found in nps with 1060 rare otus that is that have less than 10 sequences and 1029 shared between nps and gm with 381 rare otus supplementary figure 4. these results indicate that a large proportion of the otus present in the incoming waters are able to tolerate the abiotic conditions and the biotic interactions found in gutters.

we also compare the street gutters' eukaryotic photo- autotrophic and heterotrophic communities to the ones of the non-potable water sources.materials and methodsdescription of the water supply networksthe non-potable water used for the watering of street pavement and gutters originates from three factories.

similarly bacterial richness and diversity have been shown to be significantly lower in stream biofilms compared with the stream water community despite this pattern of diversity reduction a few gm sites outliers in supplementary figure 3 presented a12001000800600400200fwrwgm1.00.50.0-0.5-1.0-1.5-2-1012gnmds-125201510npsgm50al u oo d os h am rfnpsgmfigure 3 richness and diversity of the parisian street gutters and the non-potable sources.

during the same spring period without rain we also performed sampling of non-potable waters from the primary water supply sources these 6 samples are named flowing water samples or fws and from the secondary non-potable water sources that are provided by several subnets these 8 samples are named raw water samples or rws for further details see materials and methods.environmental dna extracted from 104 samples supplementary table 1 was purified and used for pcr amplifications.

network analyses demonstrated that street microbiome present many species restricted to gutters and an overlapping composition between the water sources used for street cleaning for example intra-urban aquatic networks and the associated rivers and the gutters.

our data suggests a new pattern in urban biodiversity with a high level of species only found in street gutters as well as a continuum in the community composition from the sources of non-potable waters to their actual state in streets.conclusionswe reported here for the first time that street gutters harbor an extremely diverse community of eukar- yotic microbes with varying patterns of otu composition abundance and species exclusive to one compartment.

photoautotrophic organisms are found on the surface of built or natural hard substrata such as sand rocks stone sculptures concrete walls and building facades for example in association with other organisms it was shown that subaerial algae which can form phototrophic biofilms contribute to bio- genic weathering and to the degradation of the built environment .cities also present a large diversity of built and vacant landscapes with a number of informal urban surfaces and area build- ing gaps vacant lots street verges watersides wallsfigure 1 microbial inventory of the non-potable water networks and street gutters of paris.

this pattern illustrates the important role of water sources in the colonization process of street gutters source communities are dominated by abundant diatom otus and these diatoms probably colonize gutters when water is used to clean the streets.

then we observed a clear transition from sources and similar clusters that were dominated by diatoms clusters 1 2 5 and smaller clusters to compositionally distinct clusters dominated mainly by alveolata cluster 4 fungi clusters 3 9 and 10 rhizaria cluster 6 orother stramenopiles clusters 7 and 8. interestingly the transition in mat species composition seemed not to be correlated with geographical location as sites grouped into a single cluster were distributed throughout the entire city fi4b.our analysis of the network of communities provide insights into the structure of microbial communities of street gutters and into the processes underlying their community assemblages.

we then graphically filtered out all nodes without at least one link greater than or equal to 50 that is we kept all samples and otus containing at least 50 sequences.results and discussiondiversity and structure of the microeukaryotic gutter communities in the french metropolisto perform the molecular inventory of the french metropolitan city we collected water and biofilmsfwrwabundance 104 sites 586352 reads100500richness 104 sites 6900 otus100500from 90 street gutters gms that cover all of the twenty districts of paris during a period without any precipitation.

interactions at the community level might have potentially impor- tant yet disregarded ecological roles in cities.important challenges remain associated with understanding the processes that structure gutter communities such as study of the temporal evolu- tion of street gutter communities and comparison of these communities between different megapolises cities across the world.

it also suggests the existence of microbial hotspots of diversity in parisian gutters.regarding the beta diversity we also found significant differences between gm fw and rw in terms of community composition 3b genetic diversity amova fs  25.76 po0.001 homovab  24.46 po0.001 and phylogenetic diversity unweighted unifrac po0.001 weighted unifrac po0.001 indicating that the three studied compart- ments were distinct.

the main advantages of this network approach compared with a hierarchical ascendant classification are as followsspecies identity is not lost that is we can map the connection between samples using species ii clusters are composed of both samples and species that is we can describe which taxa are driving clusters iii the results are very similar to clusters based on upgma classifications except that 'transi- tion' communities between two clusters are not arbitrarily assigned to one of the two clusters but are classified as distinct transition clusters iv the network maps the connections between clusters and thus enables a detailed analysis of how our samples are structured and v the map equation algorithm takes into account link weights and thus allows us to include species abundance in the clustering analyses.
