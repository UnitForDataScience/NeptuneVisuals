the results show that in the colon firmicutes constitute 25 of the bacterial population in both iap-ko and wt rats followed by bacter- oidetes 20 and proteobacteria 15. the bacterial popula- tion of the ti followed similar patterns as the colon with firmicutes constituting 30 of the bacterial population in both iap-ko and wt rats followed by bacteroidetes 17 and proteobacteria 15.despite the lack of difference at the level of the phyla there were significant changes at the genus level and is listed in .

intestinal permeability was quantified by fluorescein isothiocyanateedextran permeability and bacterial translocation by qrt-pcr for bacterial 16s ribosomal rna in mesenteric lymph nodes.

iap-ko pups had a nonstatistically significant 3.9-fold increased inducible nitric oxide synthase messenger rna expression compared with wt iap-ko 3.92 - 1.36 wt 1.0 - 0.27 p 14 0.03. iap-ko also had significantly increased bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes occurred in iap-ko iap-ko 7625 rfug - 3469 wt 4957 rfug - 1552 p 14 0.04.furthermore iap-ko had increased permeability iap-ko 0.297 mgml - 0.2 wt0.189 mgml - 0.15 p 14 0.07 but was not statistically significant.conclusions deficiency of iap in the newborn intestine is associated with dysbiosis and increased inflammation permeability and bacterial translocation.a 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.

to our knowledge this is the first study to examine the role of iap plays in bacterial colonization in the newborneinfant period.although the congenital absence of iap did not result in overt illness it did result in a low-grade intestinal infla- mmation a shift in the acquired microbiome favoring oppor- tunistic pathogens and increased bacterial translocation.

decreased expression of iap has been linked with pediatric intestinal diseases associated with bacterial overgrowth and subsequent inflammation.

the microbiotas of terminal ileum ti and colon was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr of subphylum- specific bacterial 16s ribosomal rna.

however iap knockout iap-ko had significantly decreased diversity of bacterial species in their colonic stool compared with heterozygous and wild-type wt.

we hypothesize that a deficiency of iap in the newborn intestine will be associated with abnormal bacterial colonization of the intestine.

in this study we examined the bacterial microbiome and the effect on intestinal homeostasis in littermate iap-ko heterozygote and wild-type wt rats at the time of weaning.segment and placed in rnalater ambion grand island ny and stored at -200c.

samples were then shipped to metanome at baylor college of medicine where 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene sequencing methods were adapted from the methods developed for the national institute of health-human micro- biome project.briefly bacterial genomic dna was extrac- ted from the samples of the ti and colon with stool left in situ using mo bio powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio labora- tories carlsbad ca.

2 e wt and iap-ko rats bacterial composition of the ti and colon were compared via phylogenetic analysis at the phylum level.

we compared the bacterial microbiome from both the ti as well as the colon in litermate iap-ko het and wt rats at the time of weaning.
