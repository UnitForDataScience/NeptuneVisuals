Given a p times s matrix X and t times s matrix Y the basic idea of JNMF is to find k basis vectors W in Rpxk and V in Rtxk for both profiles that share a common coefficient matrix H in Rkxs.

If we have v views of data we write the corresponding weighted matrix as AdvTh.To construct a consensus weighted matrix AdvThfrommulti-view dataset the simplest way is to average the sin- gle-view weighted matrix.

This technique is to define the weight matrix Ad1Th using  where L is the Laplacian matrix of the constructed weighted graph from data.

Similarly we can also obtain the weighted matrix Ad2Th from data matrix Y .

Data integration methods including approaches based on nonnegative matrix factorization NMF combine multi-view data to create a comprehensive view of a given microbiome study by integrating multi-view information.

In this paper we proposed a novel variant of NMF which called Laplacian regularized joint non-negative matrix factorization LJ-NMF for integrating functional and phylogenetic profiles from HMP.

The experimental results indicate that the proposed method offers an efficient framework for microbiome data analysis.Index Terms--Human microbiome nonnegative matrix factorization multi-view clustering data integration data representationC1INTRODUCTIONT was very hard to study the functional and phylogenetic diversity of a microbial ecosystem before the introduction of metagenomics sequencing 1.

Novel methods and software are urgently needed in this field to disentangle complex microbial community using large-scale microbiome data.Non-negative matrix factorization NMF also has been applied on analyzing microbiome datasets 12 13.
