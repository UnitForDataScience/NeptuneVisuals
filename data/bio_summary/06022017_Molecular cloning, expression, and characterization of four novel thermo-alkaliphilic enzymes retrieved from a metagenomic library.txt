Thus EcoR1BamH1 was used for gene 1 3146 bp HindIIIBamH1 for gene 2 2.4 kb EcoR1HindIII for gene 3 2.4 kb BamH1Xho1 for gene 4 and gene 8 size of 624 bp and 1134 bp respectively and HindIIIBamH1 for gene 5 1.2 kb gene 6 673 bp and gene 7 2.0 kb.

With reference to our previous study here we selected gene 2 instead of gene 3 from fosmid cloneT5-5 based on the high thermo-alkaliphilic activity with pNP-Xyl whereas the gene 3 mother fosmid clone T4-1 had shown only slight activity against pNP-Xyl .Protein 1With respect to the identification of protein 1 as an EC.3.2.1.23 GH2 several new b-galactosidase family -GH2 enzymes have recently been discovered and character- ized -.

Specifically gene 2 was selected instead of the similar gene 3 because our previous study showed that its mother fosmid clone T5-5 had yielded extracts in which proteins with thermo-alkaliphilic b-xylosidase activity were present whereas fosmid clone T4-1 source for gene 3 showed only slight b-xylosidase activity .Enzyme sizing and activityWe scaled up the production of the gene 1 2 5 and 6 products in order to obtain sufficient soluble protein for further testing.

The characterization and in vitro studies identified two new glycoside hydrolase family enzymes with a-glucosidase activities.MethodsCloning systemCloning vector pET28b Novagen Amsterdam The Netherlands was used for the expression of the selected genes.

The enzyme samples were concentrated using Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter units Millipore Amsterdam The Netherlands and quantified using the Bradford method Bradford 1X dye Biorad Veenendaal The Netherlands.

The Km values of proteins 5 and 6 with pNP-a-d-glucopyranoside were 7.4 and21.4 mM and the Vmax values were 196 and 588.2 Umg respectively.Stability of the selected enzymes at elevated temperatures In a second set of experiments we determined the stabil- ities of the enzymes encoded by genes 1 2 5 and 6 at ele- vated temperatures.

Remarkably gene 5 is here described as a gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase family GH53 protein analysis by the CAZymes analysis toolkit CAT server with predicted endo-b-1 4-galactanaseTable 2 Effects of metal ions and NaCl on the enzymatic activities of recombinant enzymes each treatment had three biological replicates aSubstrate refer to Fig.

j and this was slightly higher than the product of gene 5.Comparison of gene 5 and gene 6 productsThe products of genes 5 and 6 showed similar enzymatic activities on pNP-a-d-glucopyranoside at pH 4.0-6.0 under the same conditions.

In silico structure prediction of protein 5 revealed the presence of a potential GGDEFcatalytic site encoding a-glucosidase activity whereas that of protein 6 showed a GDSL site encoding a 'new family' a-glucosidase activity.Conclusion Using a rational screening approach we identified and characterized four thermo-alkaliphilic glycosyl hydrolases that have the potential to serve as constituents of enzyme cocktails that produce sugars from lignocellu- losic plant remains.Keywords Recombinant glycoside hydrolases Thermo-alkaliphilic enzymes Galactosidase Biomass pretreatment Biotechnological applicationBackgroundPlant biomass is considered to represent a sustainable source of sugars for biofuel production via fermentation.Correspondence Department of Microbial Ecology Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences University of Groningen Nijenborgh 7 9747AG Groningen The NetherlandsIn this biomass lignocellulosic material is the key source of 'renewable' energy .

However despite large research efforts over the past decade our limited understanding of how the glycosyl hydrolases and their associated enzymes andor proteins function together to break down ligno- cellulosic materials remains a key limitation for many applications .In a previous study we constructed fosmid librar- ies from two wheat straw-degrading microbial consor- tia which were subsequently screened for the presence of genes for hemicellulose-degrading enzymes using a multi-substrate approach .
