with reference to our previous study here we selected gene 2 instead of gene 3 from fosmid clonet5-5 based on the high thermo-alkaliphilic activity with pnp-xyl whereas the gene 3 mother fosmid clone t4-1 had shown only slight activity against pnp-xyl .protein 1with respect to the identification of protein 1 as an ec.3.2.1.23 gh2 several new b-galactosidase family -gh2 enzymes have recently been discovered and character- ized -.

specifically gene 2 was selected instead of the similar gene 3 because our previous study showed that its mother fosmid clone t5-5 had yielded extracts in which proteins with thermo-alkaliphilic b-xylosidase activity were present whereas fosmid clone t4-1 source for gene 3 showed only slight b-xylosidase activity .enzyme sizing and activitywe scaled up the production of the gene 1 2 5 and 6 products in order to obtain sufficient soluble protein for further testing.

however despite large research efforts over the past decade our limited understanding of how the glycosyl hydrolases and their associated enzymes andor proteins function together to break down ligno- cellulosic materials remains a key limitation for many applications .in a previous study we constructed fosmid librar- ies from two wheat straw-degrading microbial consor- tia which were subsequently screened for the presence of genes for hemicellulose-degrading enzymes using a multi-substrate approach .

the km values of proteins 5 and 6 with pnp-a-d-glucopyranoside were 7.4 and21.4 mm and the vmax values were 196 and 588.2 umg respectively.stability of the selected enzymes at elevated temperatures in a second set of experiments we determined the stabil- ities of the enzymes encoded by genes 1 2 5 and 6 at ele- vated temperatures.

on the other hand clone nt18-17 presumably carried a gene for a protein with a-glucosidase activity next to those for other glycoside hydrolase fam- ily enzymes as predicted by cazy database annotation.

to confirm the fidelity of the cloning the pet28b plasmids with inserts were extracted from selected clones per gene of each of the two strains and the presence of the cloned fragments detected by restriction with specific restriction enzymes followed by gel electrophoresis.
