Strik- ingly the protein 5 a-glucosidase activity decreased in the presence of all additives the activity was significantly low- ered upon addition of both 5 mM of Mg2 and 2000 mM NaCl p0.05.Analysis of the sequences of proteins 5 and 6Evidence for a new a-glucosidase encoded by gene 5 Analyses of protein 5 using BLAST-P multiple sequence alignment and subsequent tree building with the first 19wv 5-HMF inhibited all enzymes by 50-60 whereas protein 2 with pNP-Ara showed nearly 100 inhibition.

The Km values of proteins 5 and 6 with pNP-a-d-glucopyranoside were 7.4 and21.4 mM and the Vmax values were 196 and 588.2 Umg respectively.Stability of the selected enzymes at elevated temperatures In a second set of experiments we determined the stabil- ities of the enzymes encoded by genes 1 2 5 and 6 at ele- vated temperatures.

j and this was slightly higher than the product of gene 5.Comparison of gene 5 and gene 6 productsThe products of genes 5 and 6 showed similar enzymatic activities on pNP-a-d-glucopyranoside at pH 4.0-6.0 under the same conditions.

Specifically gene 2 was selected instead of the similar gene 3 because our previous study showed that its mother fosmid clone T5-5 had yielded extracts in which proteins with thermo-alkaliphilic b-xylosidase activity were present whereas fosmid clone T4-1 source for gene 3 showed only slight b-xylosidase activity .Enzyme sizing and activityWe scaled up the production of the gene 1 2 5 and 6 products in order to obtain sufficient soluble protein for further testing.

Remarkably gene 5 is here described as a gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase family GH53 protein analysis by the CAZymes analysis toolkit CAT server with predicted endo-b-1 4-galactanaseTable 2 Effects of metal ions and NaCl on the enzymatic activities of recombinant enzymes each treatment had three biological replicates aSubstrate refer to Fig.

With reference to our previous study here we selected gene 2 instead of gene 3 from fosmid cloneT5-5 based on the high thermo-alkaliphilic activity with pNP-Xyl whereas the gene 3 mother fosmid clone T4-1 had shown only slight activity against pNP-Xyl .Protein 1With respect to the identification of protein 1 as an EC.3.2.1.23 GH2 several new b-galactosidase family -GH2 enzymes have recently been discovered and character- ized -.

Statistical comparisons among samples were performed using one-way ANOVA Tukey's test using the software Past3  .Amino acid sequence and structure analyses of the gene 5 and 6 productsThe products of genes 5 and 6 proteins 5 and 6 were investigated for homology with proteins in the non- redundant protein database   using BLAST-P .

The characterization and in vitro studies identified two new glycoside hydrolase family enzymes with a-glucosidase activities.MethodsCloning systemCloning vector pET28b Novagen Amsterdam The Netherlands was used for the expression of the selected genes.
