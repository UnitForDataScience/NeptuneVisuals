A and B The GM inhibits both hypha elongation A and hypha formation B. C. albicans SC5314 cells growing at 37degC in the presence of FBS were treated with 2 and 8 GM for 1 h. The number of germ tubes of at least 100 cells treated with GM or not was counted and compared to cells treated with the control culture medium only B.

The antigrowth and antivirulence activities were partially recapitulated by secretions from Roseburia spp.

The hu- man gastrointestinal tract is the main reservoir of C. albicans from where systemic infections originate as a consequence of the disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier.

The human gastrointestinal GI tract is the main reservoir of C. albi-NovemberDecember 2017 Volume 2 Issue 6 e00555-17msphere.asm.org 1cans from where systemic infections originate as a consequence of the disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier  .

The obtained data indicated that the GM inhibits the C. albicans TOR pathway a central signaling circuit that controls cellular growth in response to environmental nutrient status in eukaryotes.

The antimicrobial activity of the gut microbiota is mediated by their rich secreted metabolome which has been shown to exhibit a significant chemical diversity   .

The obtained data demonstrate that the GM inhibited the growth of all tested fungal species with C. albicans exhibiting the highest sensitivity followed by C. tropicalis C. parapsilosis S. cerevisiae C. glabrata and C. krusei .

The activity of microbial metabolites derived from defined communities from feces of an additional donor donor 2 in addition to the therapeutic microbial ecosystem MET-1 from donor 1 was tested on C. albicans .

A and B The C. albicans SC5314 strain was grown in SC medium supplemented with 1 A and 8 B bioreactor effluent DEC60 gut metabolome GM.

The histogram in each panel indicates OD595 after 24 h of exposure.
