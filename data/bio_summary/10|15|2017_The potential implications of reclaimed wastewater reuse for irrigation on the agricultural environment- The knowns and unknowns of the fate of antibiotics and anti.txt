these are key issues in a world where the increasing water scarcity and the continuous appeal of circular economy demand answers for a long- term safe use of rww for irrigation.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.contentsintroduction449why should antibiotics and antibiotic resistance be considered as contaminants of emerging concern449fate of antibiotics in reclaimed wastewater-irrigated agricultural soil450sorption451transport in soil452transformation in soil452detection and quantification of antibiotics arb and args in soils and crops453extraction and analysis of antibiotics in soils and crops453extraction methodologies454instrumental analysis454detection and quantification of arb and args in rww soil and crop samples456effects of antibiotics on soil biota microbiome and soil fauna456antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes457uptake of antibiotics by reclaimed wastewater-irrigated crop plants in real and simulated field conditions458phytotoxic effects459public health implicationsrisk assessment462concluding remarks and recommendations for future research463acknowledgements464references464introductionwhy should antibiotics and antibiotic resistance be considered as contaminants of emerging concernsince their introduction into medicine in the 1940s antibiotics have been central to modern healthcare   .

the use of rww for irrigation and the use of biosolids as soil amendments constitute additional significant pathways for theintroduction of antibiotics in the agricultural environment as conventional wastewater treatment processes are only moderately effective at removing antibiotics from the rww  .

consequently anti- biotics are routinely detected in rww and biosolids and in rww- irrigated agricultural soils and runoff from such sites biosolids- and manure-amended soils and surface and groundwater systems and sediments receiving rww  .

currently rww is commonly used to irrigate agricultural land and urban greeneries and replenish surface and groundwater resources  .this review collates recent knowledge on antibiotics and arb and args in the agricultural environment as a result or the use of rww for irrigation.

among others the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the fate of these contaminants of emerging concern in the agricultural environment receiving rww irrigation as well as implications for plant uptake and potential negative effects on public health will be discussed and highlighted.fate of antibiotics in reclaimed wastewater-irrigated agricultural soila great number and variety of antibiotics and related elements are present in rww constituting mixtures which may continu- ously vary intra- and inter-daily seasonally and inter-annually in composition and concentrations  .

found sulfamethox- azole in soil in concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 0.28 mg kg-1 depending on the soil type following the irrigation of carrot crop with rww for a single growing period.antibiotics are ionizable molecules and can occur as neutral andor charged species zwitterionic negative or positive in the rww used for irrigation and in the receiving soil .

ionizable antibiotics regularly show lower sorption rates in alkaline soils whereas lower rates of sorption may be registered in acidic soils receiving rww irrigation as rww regularly has ph values greater than 7 7e8 which may result in elevated ph values of the soil pore water  .the effects of rhizosphere in antibiotics speciation andbioavailability should also be taken into account as the root exu- dates which may contain organic acids such as citric oxalic and malonic acids can reduce the soil pore water ph up to two units as far as 2e3 mm from the root surface compared with bulk soil .

the application of biosolids was found to increase the retardation of antibiotics in soils thus mitigating their leaching potential whereas rww irrigation may increase the mobility of weakly acidic antibiotics as the elevation of soil pore water ph due to the neutral-basic nature of rww results in the predominant presence of the anionic form of these antibiotics in soil the repulsion of antibi- otics from the negatively charged soil surfaces enhance the leaching potential .

due to prolonged rww irrigation or irrigation with rww containing high concentrations of antibiotics are necessary to induce changes in the soil microbial community structure or to promote the expression of biodegradation enzymes  .

the reuse of rww for irrigation constitutes a significant pathway for the introduction of antibiotics to the agricultural environment as conventional wastewater treatment processes are only moderately effective at removing antibiotics from the rww.

consequently antibiotics are routinely detected in rww and in rww-irrigated agricultural soils and runoff from such sites and surface and groundwater systems and sediments receiving rww.

detection and quantification of arb and args in rww soil and crop samplesthe occurrence and abundance of arb and arg in rww and soil samples may be determined either based on culture-dependent methods or on the direct analyses of total dna see .
