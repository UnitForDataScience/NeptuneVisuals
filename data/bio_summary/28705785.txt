When we only considered the obese subgroup with NASH A. muciniphila levels were significantly lower p0.037 and Enterobacteriaceae levels and F. prausnitzii levels were significantly higher p0.0019 and p0.002 respectively when compared to the normal-weight healthy controls.Fecal F. prausnitzii was found at higher levels as compared to other bacterial groups studied in both patients and controls 11.75 log10g feces.Dominant Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium SpeciesThe most abundant Lactobacillus species was L. ruminis in both patients 44.6 and healthy controls 50.0.

Blood samples were drawn for rou-tine biochemical tests and also for circulating inflammatory cy- tokines endotoxin levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein hs-cRP levels.

Se-rum endotoxin levels were also significantly higher in NASH patients when compared to controls 9.05-11.73 EUmL vs. 2.75-1.31 EUmL p0.001 Figure 2.All of the samples were studied in duplicate and the intra-assay CV was less than 10 for all assays TNF-a 5.3 and 7.8 IL-6 4.6 and 3.8 hs-CRP 9.8 and 3.4 and endotoxin 2.6 and 9.6 for patients and controls respectively.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we showed that the NASH patients had significantly lower A. muciniphila and higher Enterobacteria- ceae as well as elevated serum endotoxin and hs-CRP levels compared to healthy controls.

In our study population we also demonstrated higher circulating endotox- in levels in the patient group along with lower A. muciniphila levels suggesting the role of this bacterium in maintaining the gut barrier function.

Consistent with the in- creased Enterobacteriaceae levels in NASH patients higher serum endotoxin levels were also shown in those patients as expected.

This finding supports the possible underlying mech- anism of NASH with respect to the increased gut permeability which accelerates the bacterial translocation that is likely to be caused by reduced A. muciniphila levels and increased Entero- bacteriaceae levels.

According to our present results and the literature we suggest that the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in the gut microbiota should be considered before using probiotic treatments.To demonstrate the inflammation levels in patients with NASH we also determined the serum IL-6 and TNF-a levels which show conflicting results in the literature as inflammation mark- ers in patients with liver injury 33.

Moreover we also showed elevated circulating endotoxin levels in the patient group and higher hs-CRP levels indicating inflammation which supports the possibly increased gut bacterial translocation in NASH patients.Further studies with metagenomic approaches on NASH pa- tients might shed light on the exact effect of the microbiota.

This endotoxin translocation across the intestinal barrier is likely to be caused by dysbiosis which refers to microbial imbalance and subsequent disruption of gut barrier function due to alterations of the gut microbiota.The aim of our study was to reveal the quantitative differences of certain bacterial species in fecal microbiota in patients with bi- opsy-proven NASH a subgroup of NAFLD and healthy controls as well as to determine endotoxin levels and the inflammation status of these patients.
