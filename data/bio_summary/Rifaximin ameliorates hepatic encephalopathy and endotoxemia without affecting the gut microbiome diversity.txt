No statistically significant differences were observed in the diversity estimator Shannon diversity index and major components of the gut microbiome between the baseline and after treatment groups 3.948 - 0.548 at baseline vs 3.980- 0.968 after treatment P  0.544 but the relative abundances of genus Veillonella and Streptococcus were lowered.CONCLUSIONRifaximin significantly improved cognition and reduced endotoxin activity without significantly affecting the composition of the gut microbiome in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.Key words gut microbiome Hepatic encephalopathy Liver cirrhosis Endotoxin Rifaximinc The Authors 2017.

Rifaximin markedly improved cognition and reduced endotoxin activity without significantly affecting the composition of the gut microbiome indicating that the effect of rifaximin is independent of modification of gut microbial diversity.

These effects of rifaximin are independent of alteration of gut microbial diversity indicating that rifaximin has a potential capacity to decrease ammonia and endotoxin level other than the effect on gut microbiome such as the improvement of intestinal barrier function.

Moreover the relationship between the endotoxin activity and microbial alteration at the gene level has not been elucidated.Hepatic encephalopathy HE is a spectrum of neurop sychiatric syndromes that form major complicationsThe present study aimed to evaluate the impact of rifaximin on the endotoxin activity and gut microbKaji K et al .

Moreover the relationship between the endotoxin activity and microbial alteration at the gene level.Research objectivesTo determine the efficacy of rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy HE evaluated with serum ammonia level NCT and endotoxin activity with the linkage of gut microbiome in decompensated cirrhotic patients.Research methodsTwenty patients with decompensated cirrhosis were enrolled for this study.

Most quantitative limulus amebocyte lysate LAL tests which are widely used to measure the endotoxin levels are not endotoxin specific as these tests detect both endotoxin from Gramnegative bacteria and 13bDglucan from fungus which are microbial products translocated from the intestine.

Currently rifaximin has been suggested to partially affect gut microbiome in the patients with HE.Research motivationThe effects of rifaximin on the gut microbiome in patients from the Eastern countries have not been assessed.

The diversity and major components of gut microbiome analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are not altered by treatment with rifaximin although the relative abundances of genus Veillonella and Streptococcus were lowered.Research conclusionsThis study demonstrates that rifaximin significantly improves hepatic encephalopathy with minor modification of the gut microbiome in Japanese patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
