rifaximin effect on he and gut microbiomeeffect of rifaximin on hepatic encephalopathythe mean levels of serum ammonia among all patients remain unaltered after 4 wk of treatment with rifaximin as compared with baseline 66.7 - 29.8 mgdl at baseline vs 62.7 - 27.6 mgdl after treatment p  0.440 figure 2a although the mean levels among the patients who revealed high levels of serum ammonia  70 mgdl at baseline were significantly decreased after treatment 90.6 - 23.9 mgdl at baseline vs73.1 - 33.1 mgdl after treatment p  0.05 figure 2b.

because the microbial taxa involved are slightly different in cirrhotic patients from eastern and western countries we undertook this study to assess the effects of rifaximinon he in cirrhotic patients from eastern countries3031.rifaximin exerts its antibiotic actions via inhibition of bacterial rna synthesis by binding to the bsubunit of bacterial dnadependent rna polymerase32.

veillonella is an anaerobic gramnegative coccus and previous studies reported that its abundance increased in the colonic mucosa of cirrhotic patients with he as compared with those without he and decreased less in patients treated with rifaximin and nonabsorbable disaccharide than in those receiving nonabsorbable disaccharide monotherapy34.

currently rifaximin has been suggested to partially affect gut microbiome in the patients with he.research motivationthe effects of rifaximin on the gut microbiome in patients from the eastern countries have not been assessed.

because the microbial taxa involved are slightly different in cirrhotic patients from eastern and western countries we undertook this study to assess the effects of rifaximin on he in cirrhotic patients from eastern countries.

this effect of rifaximin on gut microbiome in japanese cirrhotic patients is similar to the patients in the west.
