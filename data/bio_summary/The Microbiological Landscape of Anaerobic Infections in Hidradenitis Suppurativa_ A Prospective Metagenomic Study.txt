We show that the microbiology of HS lesions strikingly differs from that of patients' nonlesional skin- folds confirm that S. lugdunensis a virulent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species is associated with mild HS lesions and demonstrate that specific anaerobic bacteria proliferate within a vast majority of lesions.Two predominant anaerobic gram-negative rods were enriched in anaerobic HS lesions Prevotella and Porphyromonas.

In a given patient the patient's Hurley stage corresponds to the clinical severity of the most severe HS lesion.This project was approved by the Ethical Committee Comite de Protection des Personnes Ile de France 2.SamplesTo identify bacterial taxa associated with HS lesions we com- pared the microbiology of lesions to that of nonaffected patients' skinfold areas.

For multiple comparisons procedures P values were adjusted by the false discovery rate FDR method.RESULTSMicrobiology of HS Lesions as Assessed by Bacterial CulturesThe most prevalent microbiological profile associated with HS lesions was a polymorphous anaerobic microbiota combined with normal skin commensals 83 of lesions vs 53 of con- trol samples P  10-4 Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1.

A pure or predominant culture of S. lugdunensis was recovered from 22 of samples and aerobic skin commensals in 18 of cases.Staphylococcus aureus abscesses were observed in only 2 cases.To identify other bacterial species or groups associated with HS lesions we compared the microbiology of polymi- crobial HS lesions with that of uninvolved patients' skinfolds Figure 1B and Table 2.

The association of Fusobacterium with severe HS lesions may account for their high inflammatory clinical presentation.The pathogenicity of these anaerobic commensal bacteria in HS probably results from copathogenicity 26 and adap- tive properties.

Although not demonstrated yet in HS it is likely that the high abundance of Prevotella and Porphyromonas in HS lesions reflects similar adaptive and pathogenic properties.Modification of the skin microbiome has been reported in inflammatory skin diseases and it not always clear whether skin dysbiosis may cause or is a consequence of the disease.

The low pathogenicity of the anaerobic bacteria identified here could explain the chronicity of HS lesions and the absence of systemic dissemination of the infectious process.The clinical presentation of the disease with a high frequency of acute skin abscesses and the sometimes real efficacy of TNF- blocking agents suggest that HS is not primarily an infec- tious disease but rather a skin barrier disease that predisposes patients to recurrent infections.

Further studies should focus on this issue using shotgun sequencing.CONCLUSIONSIn this study we demonstrate that specific anaerobic commensals with particular pathogenic traits proliferate within HS lesions pro- viding a rationale for antibiotic treatments of HS.

Hidradenitis suppurativa HS is a frequent and severe disease of the skin characterized by recurrent or chronic skinfold suppurative lesions with a high impact on quality of life.
