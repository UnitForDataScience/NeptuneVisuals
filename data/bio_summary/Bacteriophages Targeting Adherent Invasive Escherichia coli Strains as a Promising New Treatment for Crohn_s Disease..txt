Thus by direct and indirect methods we showed that the administration of a bac- teriophage cocktail on 1 day progressively reduced the level of LF82 colonisation of the entire GIT over the following 5 days despite the expression of the CEACAM6 receptor for AIEC.Bacteriophages reduce colitis symptoms in conventional mice colonised with AIEC strain LF82SKWe moved one step closer to clinical settings by investigating the relationship between the ability of bacteriophages to decrease col- onisation by AIEC and the control of intestinal colitis symptoms induced by DSS in conventional mice by determining DAI score see Methods.

As a prelimi- nary study showed that DAI score increased between 7 and 9 days after the administration of the LF82SK strain see Methods we investigated whether the administration of a single dose of the bac- teriophage cocktail 3 x 107 pfu either before on Day 8 preven- tive treatment or after on Day 10 curative treatment LF82SKAcocktail orstr LF82 PBSDSS 0.25-3-2-101210945 days8B 11ns 10987  7654PBS cocktail PBS cocktail PBS cocktail PBS cocktail62525ileumcolon5days41235days C109876541235daysFigure 2.

A single day of per os treatment with the three bacteriophages cocktail given to LF82-colonised CEABAC10 transgenic mice expressing the human CEACAM6 receptor for AIEC decreased significantly the number of AIEC in faeces and in the adherent flora of intestinal sections.

Bacteriophages LF82P2 and LF82P6 displayed similar profiles with higher levels of amplifica- tion from ileal and colonic sections than from the caecum and faeces whereas amplification levels for LF82P8 were high and similar for all gut sections.Bacteriophages reduce the colonisation of the gut by AIEC strain LF82 in transgenic mice expressing the human CEACAM6 glycoproteinWe then investigated the ability of a cocktail of these three bacte- riophages equal amounts of each bacteriophage to infect adherent LF82 bacteria in the CEABAC10 transgenic mouse model which expresses the human CEACAM6 receptor for AIEC bacteria.

These bacteria constitute a new pathovar of E. coli lacking the type III secretion system and other classical virulence factors typically associated with pathogenic intestinal E. coli.The prototype AIEC strain LF82 was isolated in 1998 from a chronic ileal lesion from a CD patient.Strain LF82 has type 1 pili that can bind to the host adhesion receptor carcinoembryonic anti- gen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 CEACAM6 which is more strongly expressed in the ileal tissues of CD patients than in those of controls.In transgenic CEABAC10 mice with high levels of expres- sion of human CEACAMs LF82 efficiently binds to epithelial cells and colonises gut mucosa in a type 1 pilus-dependent manner.Several therapeutic strategies targeting AIEC colonisationhave been proposed to slow or even halt the natural course of CD.

We then spotted 10-fold serial dilutions of samples onto LB agar plates covered with a lawn of strain LF82SK for the counting of bacteriophages.Bacteriophage treatment in CEABAC10 miceWe assessed the colonisation of the gut of CEABAC10 mice with LF82 using a modified version of the method described by Carvalho et al.

The bacteriophage cocktail strongly reduces the colonisation of the entire gut with the adherent invasive E. coli AIEC strain LF82.
