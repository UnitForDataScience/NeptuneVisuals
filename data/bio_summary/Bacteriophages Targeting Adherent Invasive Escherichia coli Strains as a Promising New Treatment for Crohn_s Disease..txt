mean faecal levels of strain lf82sk from day 7 to day 25 remained stable in the control group from 3.6 x 109 - 2.2 x 109 to 3.6 x 108 - 3.34 x 108cfug but decreased by 6.000 from 4.8 x 109 - 1.6 x 109 to 7.7 x105 - 1.1 x 106 cfug and 43.000 4.0 x 109 - 1.4 x 109 to 9.3 x104 - 1.1 x 105 cfug times respectively in the preventive and curative groups.

also recent evidence showed that some bacteriophages bind mucus which could affect their persistence in the git.using ceabac10 mice we showed that the cocktail of bacte-riophages strongly decreased intestinal colonisation by strain lf82 suggesting that bacteriophages were able to reach the epithelial sur- face bearing the ceacam6 receptor of strain lf82.

active replication of the cocktail was measured after 5 h from bacteriophage adminis- tration mean n-fold replication 9.43 x 103 - 2.07 x 103 and after24 h mean n-fold replication 3.22 x 104 - 6.31 x 103 confirming the killing potential of the cocktail in such environment.

bacteriophages lf82p2 and lf82p6 displayed similar profiles with higher levels of amplifica- tion from ileal and colonic sections than from the caecum and faeces whereas amplification levels for lf82p8 were high and similar for all gut sections.bacteriophages reduce the colonisation of the gut by aiec strain lf82 in transgenic mice expressing the human ceacam6 glycoproteinwe then investigated the ability of a cocktail of these three bacte- riophages equal amounts of each bacteriophage to infect adherent lf82 bacteria in the ceabac10 transgenic mouse model which expresses the human ceacam6 receptor for aiec bacteria.

these bacteria constitute a new pathovar of e. coli lacking the type iii secretion system and other classical virulence factors typically associated with pathogenic intestinal e. coli.the prototype aiec strain lf82 was isolated in 1998 from a chronic ileal lesion from a cd patient.strain lf82 has type 1 pili that can bind to the host adhesion receptor carcinoembryonic anti- gen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 ceacam6 which is more strongly expressed in the ileal tissues of cd patients than in those of controls.in transgenic ceabac10 mice with high levels of expres- sion of human ceacams lf82 efficiently binds to epithelial cells and colonises gut mucosa in a type 1 pilus-dependent manner.several therapeutic strategies targeting aiec colonisationhave been proposed to slow or even halt the natural course of cd.

one or 4 days after phage administration the mice were euthanised by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anaesthesia for assessment of the numbers of lf82 bacteria associated with colonic or ileal tissues by direct and indirect methods and for the determina- tion of bacteriophage levels by the spotting of 10-fold serial dilutions onto lb agar plates covered with a lawn of strain lf82.

thus by direct and indirect methods we showed that the administration of a bac- teriophage cocktail on 1 day progressively reduced the level of lf82 colonisation of the entire git over the following 5 days despite the expression of the ceacam6 receptor for aiec.bacteriophages reduce colitis symptoms in conventional mice colonised with aiec strain lf82skwe moved one step closer to clinical settings by investigating the relationship between the ability of bacteriophages to decrease col- onisation by aiec and the control of intestinal colitis symptoms induced by dss in conventional mice by determining dai score see methods.

a single bacteriophage application therefore successfully decreased colitis symptoms and mediated the long-term decolonisation of the git with aiec.figure 3. the bacteriophage cocktail strongly reduces the colonisation of the entire gut with the adherent invasive e. coli aiec strain lf82.

briefly 8- to 10-week-old fvbn ceabac10 transgenic mice were given dextran sodium sulphate dss molecular mass 36000-50000 daltons mp biomedicals at a concentration of 0.25 in drinking water previously shown to favour gut colonisa- tion of strain lf8210 beginning 3 days before administration of the lf82 strain.

in addition a single dose of the cocktail reduced dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis symptoms on conventional mice colonised with the strain lf82 over a 2-week period.

concomitantly we observed that the number of bacteriophages in faeces in the bacteriophage group decreases according to the concentration of strain lf82 whereas in the group of non-colonised mice it had fallen below the detection threshold within 24 h .
