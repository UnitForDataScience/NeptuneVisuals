Also the mean rate kA at which the acetic acid levels declined upon lactic acid deple- tion during the stationary growth phase was lower for S. carnosusTable 1Biokinetic parameters mean - standard deviation related to bacterial growth and arginine conversion under microaerobic or aerobic conditions and in the absence or presence of glucose.Table 2Biokinetic parameters mean - standard deviation related to glucose conversion under microaerobic or aerobic conditions in a meat simulation medium with glucose and arginine.833 than for S. haemolyticus G110 p0.05 d2.1.For the two ADI-positive strains addition of glucose slowed down arginine conversion as compared to the experiments in the absence of added glucose.

The mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-1 wascomposed of ultrapure water containing 0.05 volvol hepta- fluorobutyric acid 0.05 volvol formic acid and 1 acetonitrile volvol eluent A as well as of ultrapure water containing 0.1 volvol heptafluorobutyric acid 0.05 volvol formic acid and 99 acetonitrile volvol eluent B.

Due to matrix interference all quantifications were carried out through standard addition a.Extracellular concentrations of glucose lactic acid acetic acid and acetoin were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detection HPLC-RI using aDuring the microaerobic experiments the glucose level G in mol liter-1 was linked to the evolution of the biomass concentration X and its conversion into lactic acid L in mol liter-1 as followsdGdt 14 -1.YXGdXdt - mGX1dLdt 14 -YLGdGdt2with YXG in CFU mol-1 mG in mol CFU h -1 and YLG in mol mol-1 being the cell yield coefficient on glucose the cell mainte- nance coefficient related to glucose consumption and the lactic acid yield coefficient on glucose respectively.During the aerobic experiments the conversion patterns were more convoluted and consisted of three phases see below.

Upon aeration the three CNS strains studied simultaneously produced acetic acid lactic acid and acetoin after which a conversion of lactic acid into acetic acid was found.

In this study the conversion of the amino acid arginine by two strains with arginine deiminase ADI activity Staphylo- coccus carnosus 833 and S. pasteuri as3-13 and a strain with nitric oxide synthase NOS activity S. haemolyticus G110 was modelled as a function of glucose and oxygen availability.

When changing from microaerobic conditions to aerobiosis a switch from homolactic fermentation to a combined formation of lactic acid acetic acid and acetoin was found in all cases after which lactic acidand acetic acid were used as substrates.

Once glucose is depleted and catabolic repression of the tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle is lifted lactic acid and acetic acid are taken up by the cells0740-0020c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.and catabolised .
