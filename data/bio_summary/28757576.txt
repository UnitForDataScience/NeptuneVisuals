the high aerobic fitness group had lower serum triglycerides and leptin p  0.05 and tended to have lower cholesterol concentration than the low aerobic fitness group.comparison of microbial composition in different fitness groupsthe microbiota composition of the different fitness groups are presented in figure .

the high aerobic fitness group was relatively younger than the low aerobic fitness and control groups p  0.01. the high aerobic fitness group weighed less had lower bmi and fat and were more active than the other two groups p  0.005. no significant differences in energy yield nutrients carbohydrate protein fat and fiber intake were found among the groups.

using multivariable comparison we found that the high fitness group had higher proportions of bacteroides p  0.038 but lower erec p  0.040 than the low fitness group.

nerveless our results provide new information that there is a moderate association between physical fitness and certain gut microbiota in premenopausal women.conclusionsin conclusion a low proportion of erec in the gut is associated with high aerobic fitness in women independent of age and dietary intakes.

however earlier studies were done in athletic men and young adults a current study has shown that estrogen in women influences gut microbiota  but overweight or obese women with relatively low physical fitness remain to be studied.physical fitness is considered one of the most objective measures of the level of physical activity .

more specifically we examined 1 the correlations between cardiorespiratory fitness and specific bacteria groups and 2 whether these correlations between cardiorespiratory fitness and specific bacteria groups were independent of age dietary intake and whole-body fat mass.materials and methodsstudy design and subjectsthe study participants consisted of 71 finnish women aged 19 to 49 years who resided in the city of jyvaskyla central finland which has a population of approximately 150000 .

however when fat was included in the model the significant differences between erec and vo2max triglycerides and leptin disappeared.figure 2. the associations of erec group with vo2max fat and energy yield e nutrients.

the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and certain bacteria in our study was confounded by adiposity which raised the question of whether cardiorespiratory fitness plays a role in altering gut microbiota.

controlling for fat the significant associations between the erec group and triglycerides remained but disappeared between the erec group and hdl.
