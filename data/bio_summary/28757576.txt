We found that EreC was inversely correlated with VO2max p  0.010 Figure a and carbohydrate intake p  0.034 Figure c but positively with fat p  0.002 Figure b and fat intake p  0.034 Figure d. EreC was also negatively correlated with HDL p  0.028 but positively with triglycerides p  0.002 and leptin p  0.001 Table .

By contrast EreC was positively associated with fat r  0.382 p  0.002 dietary fat intake r  0.258 p  0.034 triglycerides r  0.390 p  0.002 and leptin r  0.424 p  0.001 but negatively with carbohydrate intake r  -0.252 p  0.034 and HDL r  -0.26 p  0.028.

VO2max also negatively correlated with fat r  -0.755 p  0.001 triglycerides r  -0.274 p  0.021 and leptin r  -0.574 p  0.001.

On the other hand VO2max was negatively correlated with fat r  -0.755 p  0.001 triglycerides r  -0.274 p  0.021 and leptin r  -0.574 p  0.001.

We found that participants with low VO2max had lower Bacteroides but higher Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides than the high VO2max group p  0.05 for all.

Therefore to study whether the level of physical fitness is associated with certain compositions of the gut microbiota using VO2max as a segregate variable is possible option in a cross-sectional study design.

VO2max was inversely associated with EreC r  -0.309 p  0.01 but not with other bacteria.

The association between VO2max and EreC however appears to be mediated by body fatness.Keywords exercise VO2max gut microbiota body fatnessIntroductionThere is growing awareness that microbial communities colonize different regions of the gastrointestinal tract playing a major role in the health and disease of their host .

In our early study 80 of the people who participated in our study were still living in Jyvaskyla after 10 years and there were no differences between people who were living inside the city compared to those who were living outside the city unpublished data.

Using multivariable comparison we found that the high fitness group had higher proportions of Bacteroides p  0.038 but lower EreC p  0.040 than the low fitness group.
