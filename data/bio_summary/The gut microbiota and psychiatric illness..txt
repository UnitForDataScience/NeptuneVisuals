JB1 also increased exploratory be haviour6 and this effect was associated with brain region- specific changes in the gaminobutyric acid GABA system and was dependent on vagal integrity.6 Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 normalized anxiety in mice with chemically induced lowgrade inflammation.7 In contrast other bacteria can induce anxietylike behaviour in rodents and this is ef fect also appears to be mediated by the vagus nerve.89 Social disruption in rodent models is associated with reduced rich ness and diversity of the gut microbial community along with shifts at the level of operational taxonomic units OTUs groups of microorganisms clustered by DNA sequence similarity suggesting a bidirectional component to brain-gut- microbiota relations.1011 Diet may also play a role.12 Animal studies therefore provide strong support to the notion that altering the gut microbiota might result in altered behaviour.

One recent study found that there was no significant difference in species richness between depressed and nondepressed participants19 although another study reported that depression was associated with decreased gut microbiota richness and diversity20 and another reported lower Bifidobacterium counts in patients with MDD.21Fecal microbiota transfer from patients with MDD to microbiotadeficient animals can induce behavioural changes in the recipient animal that are considered analogues of de pression or anxiety.1819There are few reports of randomized controlled trials evalu ating the effect of probiotics in psychiatric patients.

Finally describing alteration in the microbiota of people with psychiatric illness requires a multidisciplinary team in cluding disciplines such as psychiatry neurobiology infor matics microbiology gastroenterology and epidemiology.Such a team would be difficult to assemble and coordinate.Are there other ways to approach the study of the brain and microbiomePatients with GI disorders have higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population25 and those with other chronic diseases.26 This applies to both patients with in flammatory bowel disease IBD27 and those with irritable bowel syndrome IBS.28The corollary is also true patients with anxiety and depres sion have more GI symptoms than healthy controls.29 A group recently reported that fecal microbiota signatures are similar be tween patients with depression and those with IBS in that they were less diverse than samples from controls and had similar abundances of alterations.30 Although the gut-brain axis has been widely recognized the nature of these interactions remains poorly understood.

Animal studies consistently report that behaviour and the function of the nervous system are modulated by gut microbiota see the reviews by Dinan and Cryan2 Foster3 and Anglin and colleagues4.

Perturbing the gut microbiota in mice with antibiotics is associated with altered brainderived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus and amygdala and an increase in mouse exploratory behaviour considered a surrogate for decreased anxiety.5 Chronic administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus str.

These findings are consistent with those of a study in which healthy volunteers who took 1 of 2 prebiotics for 3 weeks had decreased attentional vigilance to negative ver sus positive information in a dotprobe task.15 In that study however there were more measures anxiety perceived stress memory that did not change with either of the pre biotic products making it hard to evaluate the significance of change on the dotprobe only.15 A small study reported that women who consumed fermented milk product with pro biotics had changes in midbrain connectivity during an emo tional attention task compared with women who did not con sume the product with probiotics.16Correspondence to G.

There are even fewer data on diet antibiot ics and fecal microbiota transplant therapy some or all of which may have a role in modulating the gut microbiome to improve psychiatric illness.What are the barriers to microbiome research in people with psychiatric illnessesThere are substantial challenges to elucidating the role of the microbiome in human health and disease.

A portion of the cohort will participate in treatment trials that The gut microbiota and psychiatric illness will allow for testing of novel therapies for the treatment of IBD and IBS and the psychiatric disorders associated with these diseases.
