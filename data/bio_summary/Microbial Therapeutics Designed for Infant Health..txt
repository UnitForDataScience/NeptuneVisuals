on the infant gut have been noted in two human interventions .TaBle 1  A Prebiotics effective in altering the intestinal microbiota in human infant studies B probiotic strains effective in altering the intestinal microbiota in a number of human infant studies and C synbiotics effective in altering the intestinal microbiota in a number of human infant studies.Healthy FT-FFB.

The aim of this mini-review is to highlight the beneficial effects of different probiotic and prebiotic treatments in early life with particular emphasis on the different conditions which nega- tively impact microbial colonisation at birth.Keywords probiotics prebiotics gut microbiota infant healthinTRODUCTiOnFrom birth through to the initial stages of weaning intestinal microbial composition has a significant impact on infant gut health.

found that prolonged breast feeding 4 months had a signifi- cant effect on the microbial composition of cesarean delivered FT infants at 24 weeks of life in comparison to vaginally deliveredinfants suggesting that breastmilk may prove to be even more beneficial in caesarian delivered infants.Prebiotics and weaningIt is well known that the infant gut microbiome does not fully develop until an infant reaches 2-3 years of age.

Therefore it is important that we recognize the changes occurring in the infant gut during this transition from early infant feeding to solid foods.

Digestion of these foods provides a vari- ety of fermentable substrates necessary for the growth of colonic bacteria and thus further investigation into the by-products of predigested foods may provide valuable information to posi- tively modulate the infant gut throughout weaning.With respect to prebiotic supplementation of infant formulae recent studies have investigated the use of GOS and FOS to reduce pH and produce a similar short-chain fatty acid SCFA profile to that of exclusively breastfed infants .

Indeed where infant formulae have been supplemented with GOSFOS a higher abundance of B. longum was found in the infant gut  .

This suggests that a microbe-mediated therapy such as B. fragilis may alleviate various behavioral disorders during childhood.COnClUSiOnThroughout this mini-review we have discussed the introduction of microbial therapeutics in addition to prebiotic supplementa- tion to highlight the health benefits for their use in relieving GI distress in early life.With regards to infant formulae prebiotic supplementation with a mixture of GOSFOS can help mimic the composition of breastmilk and promote the development of Bifidobacterium in the infant gut in particular B. longum.In terms of the clinical use of probiotics it is crucial that we develop standardized treatments which take into account the age group of a specific human cohort in addition to health status of the group in question.

Host genetics maternal health status mode of delivery gestational age feeding regime and perinatal antibiotic usage are known factors which can influence the development of the infant gut microbiome.

Thus it is imperative that we understand how the introduction of particular microbial species and prebiotic additives may restore balance and ameliorate the effects associated with gastrointestinal GI disorders.gi Microbial Development at BirthMany studies have begun to focus on the development of the infant gut microbiome over time -.

A study by our group found that in full-term FT cesarean delivered infants an increased fecal abundance of Firmicutes and lower abundance of Actinobacteria was evident after the first week of life how- ever the gut microbiota of preterm PT infants displayed a significantly greater abundance of Proteobacteria compared to the FT infant group.
