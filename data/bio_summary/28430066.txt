As the authors mention we have already provided an in depth discussion of most of their issues and others in our 2013 book The Human Microbiome Ethical Legal and Social Concerns Rhodes Gligorov and Schwab 2013.

The other matter that we address is the authors' adoption of a rather standard and problematic approach to vulnerability.UNCERTAINTYThe National Institutes of Health NIH launched the Human Microbiome Project HMP in 2007.

The scientific work sup- ported by HMP quickly and significantly advanced our knowledge of the human microbiome.

The combination of the vastness of the unknown together with the enthusiasm for expanding the application of FMT strikes us as dangerous.

The unsupported hype about the purported efficacy of FMT is likely to encour- age physicians to incorporate it into their standard practice and patients to clamor for the treatment.

The availability of the unstudied intervention will make patients reluctant to participate in clinical trials and manufacturers reluctant to ini- tiate trials that could show that their financially successful products are actually useless or harmful Bender Flicker and Rhodes 2007.

The posi- tion taken also seems somewhat inconsistent with Ma and colleagues' concerns about vulnerability which we discuss next.VULNERABILITYBiologically we are all vulnerable to death disease injury pain suffering and disability.

The new guidelines also recognize that context and risk related factors are relevant considerations in deciding when and how groups should be protected Council for International Organizations of Medical1.
