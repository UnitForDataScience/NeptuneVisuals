we also found that mi significantly affected the gut microbiota by comparison of the mi group with the sham r2 0.22 p  0.05 or non-surgery group r2 0.21 p  0.01 among the exercise-trained mice and similar findings were observed for the sedentary mice mi group vs. sham group r2 0.19 p  0.01 mi group vs. non-surgery group r2 0.21 p  0.01 .

additionally our results suggest that the mi mice harbored a distinct gut bacterial community structure as demonstrated by the fact that the dissimilarities observed between the negative control group and the sham group were significantly smaller than those between the mi and sham groups in the weighted unifrac and unweighted unifrac distance analyses.one potential reason that there was no significant difference between the mi groups is that mi severely influences cardiac function and leads to changes in intestinal blood perfusion and the intestinal microenvironment and these alterations might disguise the influence of exercise.

the dissimilarity distance in the mi vs. sham comparison was significantly higher than that in the non-surgery vs. sham comparison further suggesting that the mi groups experienced greater changes in the gut microbiota than wereobserved in the sham-operated mice and those not treated with surgery .we also analyzed the differences in composition between the exercise-trained and control mice in the non-surgery sham and mi groups .

while exercise may also affect the community composition of the gut microbiota in the mi group a beta-diversity analysis of the unifrac distance was performed in a pcoa analysis and revealed clustering between the exercise and non-exercise samples obtained from the mi groups.

to acquire a more accurate view of the changes that occurred in the gut microbial community of mi mice we performed beta diversity analysis using weightedunifrac and unweightedunifrac distances to compare the differences between non-surgery vs. sham and mi vs. sham groups for both the exercise-trained and non-exercise- trained mice.

moreover compared to control mi mice exercise mi mice tended to have higher ef and fs although these differences were not significant.

of particular note is the finding that exercise was previously shown to exert cardioprotective effects in mi mice by inhibiting oxidative stress ameliorating inflammatory injury increasing the expression of vegf vascular endothelial growth factor and reducing mi size     .

in exercise-trained mi mice the relative abundance of phenylobacterium and roseateles was higher than that observed in the corresponding control mi mice.

in addition the mi model was induced by coronary ligation in contrast with spontaneous mi which is typically accompanied by risk factors such as diabetes hyperlipidemia or hypertension.

however the metabolic state of mi mice is different from that of patients as the most common type of mi was caused by plaque rupture and was associated with various cardiovascular risk factors.

this model of mi is most likely type-ii mi which is caused by coronary spasm or embolization  .

here we focused on the relationships among exercise the gut microbiota and cardiac function after myocardial infarction mi.

in addition physical exercise and mi led to alterations in gut microbial composition.

however the effect of exercise training on the microbiome in myocardial infarction mi remains unexplored.

here we hypothesize that exercise training will trigger changes in the gut microbiome that favor a healthier phenotype and improve cardiac function in mi mice.
