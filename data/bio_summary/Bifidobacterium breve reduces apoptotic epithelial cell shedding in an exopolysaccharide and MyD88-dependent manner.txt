Mice were then administered LPS to induce pathological cell shedding followed by sacrifice at 1.5 h. Following dosing with B. breve UCC2003 and inductionof cell shedding with LPS mice showed a marked reduction in the levels of CC3-positive shedding cells compared with LPS- treated control mice receiving PBS gavage ab.

To determine the contribution of bifidobacteria in cell shedding we employed a well character- ized in vivo mouse model in which pathological cell shedding is induced by intraperitoneal IP administration of lipopoly- saccharide LPS driving mononuclear cell expression of TNF-a and subsequent caspase-3-positive shedding cells .

A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as significant in all cases.ResultsLipopolysaccharide induces cell shedding from small intestinal villi in a dose-dependent mannerCaspase-3 is activated in IECs during their extrusion from the tips of small intestinal villi Similar to previous reports we found that control C57 BL6 mice receiving IP PBS injection showed low levels of cell shedding as evi- denced by low level expression of cleaved caspase-3 CC3 in the epithelial cell layer a.

PBS e. Taken together these data indicate that functional MyD88 signalling potentially via TLR2 is required for modulating the protective effect of B. breve against cell shedding outcomes.Bifidobacterium breve exopolysaccharide plays a role in modulating protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced cell sheddingRecently a number of functions modulated by bifidobacteria have been shown to be mediated through surface-associated EPS including resistance to gut infection Interestingly the eps gene clusters represent a relatively conserved feature of bifidobacterial genomes including those of the species B. breve In order to investigate the role of EPS in modulat- ing the response against cell shedding we used a deletion mutant B. breve UCC2003-EPSdel that expresses neither EPS1 nor EPS2 Mice were stably colonized by dosing with B. breve EPS-positive or EPS-negative strains followed by challenge with LPS electronic supplementary material figure S1.

Our studies with confocal endomicroscopy of patients with IBD in clinical remission have demonstrated that those patients with high rates of cell shedding are more likely to relapse than those with low shedding rates demonstrating a causative link between barrier function and the inflammatory response .Given reports of beneficial effects of certain members of the gut microbiota in IBD and potential roles of microbial dysbiosis in these diseases we hypothesized that certain health- promoting microbiota members including Bifidobacterium may play a role in protecting against the cell shedding response by modulating IEC function.

Recent studies have demonstrated that following IP injection of mice with LPS isolated from Escherichia coli 0111B4 a potent cell shedding response is induced similar to that observed in relapsing IBD patients In agreement with these studies we found a significant increase in CC3-mediated cell shedding at 1.5 h post-injection of 1.25 mg kg21 LPS not only at the villus tip but also along the shoulders and sides of the villus b.

Thus to determine whether the cell shedding outcome as modulated by B. breve was caused by reduced expression of TNF-a from macrophages we isolated RNA and protein from whole small intestine of control and B. breve UCC2003- treated C57 BL6 mice following LPS-mediated induction of cell shedding.

In a UV model of apoptosis MyD88 signalling appears to reduce caspase-3 and in turn increase cell survival and more recently B. bifidum has been shown to reduce apoptosis in vitro necrotizing enterocolitis IEC-6 cell model as also indi- cated by reduced CC3-positive cells Thus our data in tandem with these studies indicate that B. breve UCC2003 may regulate epithelial integrity in response to LPS-induced cell shedding as marked by caspase-3 via these central MyD88 signalling mechanisms potentially downstream of TLR2.Having determined the importance of host adaptor MyD88 we next sought to determine if there was a specific bifidobacterial molecule central to the observed protective response.

Together these data suggest that coloniza- tion with B. breve does not produce significant shifts in the overall gut microbiota community structure and that the observed protective effects after colonization are more likely to be related to direct effects of B. breve possibly through interactions with the IECs.The mechanism of protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced cell shedding is TNF-a independentLPS-induced cell shedding is caused by the release of TNF-a from lamina propria tissue-resident macrophages which binds to TNF-receptor 1 TNF-R1 on IECs  thereby driv- ing the apoptotic response.

C57 BL6 MyD8822 villin-cre showed no protection against cell shedding after colonization of B. breve UCC2003 cd this was in stark contrast to MyD88- positive control animals which again showed significant protection against LPS-induced cell shedding ab.
