The mRNA levels of TNF-a IL-1b IL-10 and Saa were higher in L. casei BL23-treated larvae than in GF larvae at 24 h  P  0.01 and lower except IL-10 at 48 h after challenge with A. veronii P  0.05.Collectively these data indicated that the protection of L. casei BL23 against A. veronii infection in zebrafish larvae was mediated by baceterium itself and did not involve the microbiota.Protective Effect of L. casei BL23 Irrespective of Cells' ViabilityIn order to determine whether protective effect of L. casei BL23 in zebrafish is mediated by cellular metabolites or cell structural components we tested the effect of live and dead 4 paraformaldehyde fixed cells of L. casei BL23 in both conventional and GF zebrafish.

However gene knockout zebrafish lacking related factors are needed to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the action of EPSP.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAll authors listed have made a substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the Key Project of Chinese National Programs for Fundamental Research and Development2015CB150605 the National Natural Science Foundation of China 31272672 31572633 and National gm project National gm project.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThe authors thank LetPub  for providing linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at FIGURE S1  The anti-infective effect of potential protiotics against Aeromonas veronii in zebrafish larvae.FIGURE S2  Gut microbiota of zebrafish from control or Lactobacillus casei BL23 treated fish at class A order B and family C level.FIGURE S3  The mRNA levels of TLR3a A TLR3b B TLR4a C TLR5a DTLR5b E MyD88 F and NF-kB G in ZFL cells from control and Exopolysaccharide-protein complex EPSP-treated 10 ugmL groups after 24 h treatment.REFERENCESAbbass A.

Wherever applicable P-values are reported and a P-value of 0.05 is considered significant.RESULTSIdentification of Probiotic Bacteria That Mitigate A. veronii Infection inPre-colonized Zebrafish LarvaeIn order to screen the probiotic strains that protect zebrafish larva from damage induced by A. veronii infection we pre-colonized unhatched 3 dpf conventional zebrafish larvae with 17 Gram-positive bacteria commonly often used as probiotics in aquaculture and elsewhere in the food industry .

These gut microbiota recipient larvae were then infected with A. veronii at 7 dpf and their mortality was compared to that of the A. veronii-infected GF larvae.

The results showed that for both conventional and GF zebrafish live and dead cells of L. casei BL23 both efficiently increased the survival rate of zebrafish larvae after infection with A. veronii  2EF P  0.05.

Then the larvae were infected with A. veronii at 7 dpf and the survival rates of these fish were compared to the A. veronii-infected GF fish.

These findings indicated that the EPSP enhanced zebrafish immuneresponse against A. veronii might involve the TLR1TLR2 signal pathway.CONCLUSIONOur results indicated that the L. casei BL23 showed high efficiency against A. veronii infection in zebrafish irrespective of cell viability.
