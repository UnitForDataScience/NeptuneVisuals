The certainty in the evidence is low or very low because of the risk of bias inconsistency and imprecision of results and indirectness of available research.As underlined in two recent reviews replication of the promising results in collaborative well-coordinated multicen- tre harmonized studies with multidisciplinary expertise in pediatrics immunology and microbiology would thus be of great importance to enable future evidence-based implementa- tion .A more prolonged gut microbiota management could achieve a long-lasting impact  .GUiDelineS ReCOMMenDATiOnS OveR TO SCienTiFiC SOCieTieSThe European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology EAACI stated in its food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines on primary prevention of allergy that there is no evidence to recommend prebiotics or probiotics or other dietary supple- ments based on particular nutrients to prevent food allergy in at risk groups and in the general population grade of recommendation B .The Nutrition Committee of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition ESPGHAN concluded 2011 after a systematic literature review on the effect of infant formula supplemented with prebiotics or probiotics on the preventive effect on allergy that there is too much uncertainty to draw reliable conclu- sions from the available data .The World Allergy Organization WAO suggested 2015 on their guidelines on the prevention of allergy to consider using probiotics inwomen pregnant with children with high risk for allergywomen who breastfeed infants at high risk of developing allergy andinfants at risk of developing allergies because there is a net benefit resulting in primary prevention of eczema .COnClUSiOnThere is no positive recommendation from any scientific com- munity to use specific probiotics for the prevention of food allergy or other allergic manifestations  but their use in prevention as a whole class has widespread in clinical practice  .

Currently there is no positive recommendation from scientific societies to use pre- or probiotics for treatment of food allergy or other allergic manifestations while their use in prevention is being custom-cleared.

Studies relying on bacterial cultures showed that infants allergic to cow's milk had higher total bacteria and anaerobic counts  but this finding was not consistent across studies  and no association could be established between culturable gut bacteria and sensitization to food including milk casein egg peanut and hazelnut .The hypothesized mechanisms by which the commensal microbiota influences the outcome of the allergic response are manifold .
