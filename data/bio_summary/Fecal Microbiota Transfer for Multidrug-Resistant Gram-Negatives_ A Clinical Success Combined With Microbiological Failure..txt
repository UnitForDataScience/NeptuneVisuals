Fecal microbiota transfer may have contributed to clin- ical success but it cannot be excluded that MDR P aeruginosa was already eradicated from the gut before FMT because the P aeruginosa could not be cultured the day before FMT.A remarkable observation is the persistence of an ESBL- positive E coli after FMT.

This suggests that novel strains acquired via FMT can colonize the gut without replac- ing the indigenous strain population of the recipient.In contrast to the diminished microbiota of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection CDI patients our patient had an intact microbiota diversity and composition at phylum level before FMT.

It is clear that more research on FMT for eradication of colonization of differ- ent MDR bacterial species is required.Only 8 case reports have been published showing that FMT resulted in intestinal decolonization of ESBL- and carbapene- mase-producing Enterobacteriaceae VRE or methicillin-re- sistant S aureus .

A few reports men- tion success with fecal microbiota transfer FMT to elim- inate extended-spectrum b-lactamase ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

We pres- ent a 34-year-old patient on peritoneal dialysis PD treated with FMT to eradicate a Verona integron-encoded metal- lo-b-lactamase VIM-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa caus- ing recurrent urinary tract infections UTIs which hampered planned kidney-pancreas transplantation.

CA MSSA catheter-related bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus areus FMT fecal microbiotica transfer GI gastrointestinal MDR multidrug resistant PD peritoneal dialysis.Seventy-five grams of feces was homogenized with saline and sieved 300-mm mesh to remove undigested food fragments.

The stool cul- ture taken before FMT was negative for the MDR P aeruginosa but it did contain an ESBL-producing Escherichia coli suscep- tible to carbapenems gentamicin piperacillintazobactam and colistin.

The E coli post-FMT was identical to the E coli found before FMT using AFLP.

However the patient was treated once with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for cystitis caused by an ESBL-positive E coli 8 months after FMT.

Unfortunately this strain was not available for AFLP analysis.16S analysis of the patient's stool 19 and 1 days before FMT revealed a diverse microbiota composition ie high Shannon diversity index of 7.8 and 8.1 respectively.
