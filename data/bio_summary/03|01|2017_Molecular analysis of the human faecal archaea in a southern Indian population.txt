1996. a study in a western population reported that archaea transiently occurred in the faeces of neonates in the first weeks of life and thereafter reappeared only at a much later age palmer et al.

overall mean distance was 0.4 and sequences were used to produce an unrooted phylogenetic tree accord- ing to the neighbour-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates and using the jukes-cantor model.nucleotide sequence accession numbersthe nucleotide sequences reported in this study appear in the genbank nucleotide sequence database with the following accession numbers nea - kf607113 - kf607228 pwa- kf607229 - kf607339 psa - kf607567 - kf607681 sga- kf607340 - kf607449 ada - kf607450 - kf607566 ela - kf607682 - kf607798 and taa- kf607799 - kf607918.ethical considerationsthe consent forms and study protocol were approved by the institutional review board irb christian medical col- lege vellore.resultscleaned sequences from neonate 116 clones post-weaning 111 clones preschool 115 clones school going 110 clones rural adult 117 clones elderly population 117 clones and tribal adult 120 clones were used for taxonom- ic and phylogenetic analysis.

as can be seen from this the overwhelming majority of faecal archaeal sequences in all the groups belonged to methano-brevibacter smithii.distribution of archaeal taxa among the different study groupswe attempted to compare the distribution of archaeal taxa among the various study groups.
