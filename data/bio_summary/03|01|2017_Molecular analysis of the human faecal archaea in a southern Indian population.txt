Twenty-two sequences that corre- sponded with 99 similarity to those already available in the NCBI database were labelled with the NCBI accession number while nine sequences that were described for the first time in this study are depicted by green diamonds and marked with study identifier numbers Ne neonate PW pre-weaning TA tribal adult.gut in the developing countries is consistent with the very early microbial colonization of the gut that we have earlier noted in newborn infants in southern India Kabeerdoss et al.

Examination of 16S ribosomal RNA genes provides a powerful tool to study the gastrointestinal microbiota without culturing them Yarza et al.

A study in Italy did not find meth- anogenic archaea in children below the age of 27 months Rutili et al.

A study in a Western population reported that archaea transiently occurred in the faeces of neonates in the first weeks of life and thereafter reappeared only at a much later age Palmer et al.

Overall mean distance was 0.4 and sequences were used to produce an unrooted phylogenetic tree accord- ing to the neighbour-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates and using the Jukes-Cantor model.Nucleotide sequence accession numbersThe nucleotide sequences reported in this study appear in the GenBank nucleotide sequence database with the following accession numbers NeA - KF607113 - KF607228 PWA- KF607229 - KF607339 PSA - KF607567 - KF607681 SGA- KF607340 - KF607449 AdA - KF607450 - KF607566 ElA - KF607682 - KF607798 and TAA- KF607799 - KF607918.Ethical considerationsThe consent forms and study protocol were approved by the Institutional Review Board IRB Christian Medical Col- lege Vellore.ResultsCleaned sequences from neonate 116 clones post-weaning 111 clones preschool 115 clones school going 110 clones rural adult 117 clones elderly population 117 clones and tribal adult 120 clones were used for taxonom- ic and phylogenetic analysis.

As can be seen from this the overwhelming majority of faecal archaeal sequences in all the groups belonged to Methano-brevibacter smithii.Distribution of archaeal taxa among the different study groupsWe attempted to compare the distribution of archaeal taxa among the various study groups.

The enormous progress of the last two decades in characterizing the composition and function of the gut microbiota was primarily driven by the development of molecular tools for analysis and the development of molecular phylogenetics Ramakrishna 2007 Lagier et al.

There are four phyla of archaea thatare widely distributed in the environment Schleper et al.
