Still one fami- ly Leuconostocaceae and six low abundant genera unclassCoriobacterineae unclassifiedEnterobacteria- ceae Clostridium XIVa Holdemania Leuconostoc and Haemophilus were different between lean and obese after long-term calorie restriction.Long-term calorie restriction shifted the structure of thebGAL microbiota of obese individuals to a lean oneHaving defined the composition and structure of the total gut microbiota we studied the effect of calorie restriction on the composition of the bGAL microbiota.

In contrast to the extensive shifts in the composition and structure of bGAL microbiota in obese subjects our results showed that calorie restric- tion did not modify the carbohydrate metabolic capacity of gut microbiota that was significantly higher compared to lean subjects at all time points.Microbial diversity and metabolic performance correlate with body mass index and insulin resistanceWith the demonstration of obesogenic microbiota in rodent systems and in humans the focus of the field has shifted to the understanding of the mechanisms through which bacteria regulate obesity Delzenne and Cani 2011.

Faecal microorganisms were marked by means of fluorescent labelling of b-galactosidase activity bGAL microbiota and were separated by fluorescent activatedGut microbiota responses to calorie restriction in obese 1537cell sorting FACS.

This result suggested that there may be a group of widespread phylotypes within the total gut microbiota whereas the bGAL microbiota may be unique to each individual.

These results suggest that the bGAL microbiota is a subset of thetotal gut microbiota comprised by a lower number of spe- cialized bacterial groups whose relative abundances are more equally distributed among its constituents.Impact of calorie restriction on the structure and diversity of the total gut microbiotaDietary interventions with calorie restricted diets in obese cohorts have mainly measured community shifts on short timescales and have failed to find significant diet specific effects Tagliabue and Elli 2013.

Arguably diet is one of the most easily controlled factors that can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota in humans Xu and Knight 2015.VC 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley  Sons Ltd Environmental Microbiology 19 1536-15511546 A. Ruiz et al.Calorie restricted diets reduce weight and are suspected to impact human gut microbiota independently of its cause.

Only long-term calorie restriction induced clear changes in the microbiota of obese adolescents.

Long-term calorie restriction induced significant shifts in total and bGAL gut microbiota reducing the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio and enhancing the growth of beneficial microorganisms such as Bacteroides Roseburia Faecalibacterium and Clostridium XIVa.

Our study shows that calorie restriction is a strong environmental force reshaping gut microbiota though its metabolic performance is linked to host's adiposity suggesting that functional redundancy and metabolic plasticity are fundamental properties of gut microbial ecosystem.IntroductionObesity is an enormous public health problem that arises as a consequence of complex socioeconomic and genetic factors that favour increased dietary intake and reduced physical activity ultimately disrupting energy homeostasis Swinburn et al.

Experimental evidences indicate a role for the gut microbiota in promoting obesity and it is viewed increasingly as an important target of dietary inter- ventions and pharmacologic agents Delzenne and Cani 2011 Xu and Knight 2015 Marchesi et al.
