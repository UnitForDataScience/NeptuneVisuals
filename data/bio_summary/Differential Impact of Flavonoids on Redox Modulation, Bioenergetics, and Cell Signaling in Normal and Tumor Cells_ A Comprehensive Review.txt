Oxidation of quercetin yields superoxide and a more reactive quinone form which can interact with glutathione or with cysteine residues on a protein such as Nrf2 or Keap-1.oxidation of quercetin and inhibits formation of the quinone forms 131 but once formed quercetin quinone reacts preferentially with thiol groups compared with ascorbate 23.

In contrast when benzoa- pyrene was used to generate lung cancer in Swiss albino mice quercetin supplementation exerted a protective effect against cancer development but crucially as a guide for mechanism of action the effect was much more pronounced when quercetin was given as a chemopreventive agent rather than as a chemotherapeutic agent 110.

When female ACI rats were given quercetin 2.5 gkg food for 8 months there was no protection against breast cancer 224 but quercetin together with doxorubicin increased anti-tumor activity in mice with 4T1 breast cancer 63.

Consequently although Caco-2 or Caco-2TC7 cells can be used as a model to examine theabsorption or biological effects of quercetin as an aglycone they cannot be used to examine the action of quercetin gly- cosides or indeed any other phytochemical bound to a sugar moiety this includes plant extracts where the active com- ponents are glycosylated.

Although there are no external docking sites on the sugar transporter GLUT1 for quercetin within the inner vestibule glutamate and lysine residues hydrogen-bond quercetin completely inhibiting glucose transfer when bound 48.

After consumption of quercetin in humans glutathionyl quercetin adducts are found at low levels in urine suggesting that the conjugation reaction can occur in vivo 101.

The quinone form of quercetin is only a poor substrate for NQO1 and although NQO1 is induced by quercetin NQO1 does not provide protection from the effects of quer- cetin quinone 22.

Although these conjugation reactions clearly occur both in vitro and in vivo the predominant re- action of quercetin is conjugation with methyl glucuronosyl or sulfate groups 20 55 86 and as a result these metabo- lites of quercetin dominate in urine 101 166 and plasma 53 166 Figs.

However some studies have suggested that quercetin does not interact with Nrf2 in en- dothelial cells 214 although we have data showing that quercetin is a potent HO-1 inducer in HUVECs unpublished data.

Whentreated with 20 lM quercetin GSH concentration in HAEC transiently dropped by 20 and returned to baseline within 18 h. Since GSSG also decreased this suggests that these changes were due to consumption of glutathione rather than thiol oxidation and in support of this quercetin glutathione conjugates were exported into the medium 132.A substantial literature documents the chemopreventive effect of Nrf2 activators 268 particularly those that are naturally occurring.
