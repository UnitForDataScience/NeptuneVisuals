it has been also demonstrated that patients having nsclc and receiving antibiotics had significantly shorter os compared with the other group 7.0 vs 13.8 months p  0.038. furthermore median pfs was significantly lower in patients having renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma and receiving antibiotics 4.3 vs 7.4 months p  0.013 and 1.8 vs 4.3 months p  0.048 respectively.

in addition diversity and abundance of specific bacteria were associated with higher pfs in response to pd-1 inhibitors p  0.009 and p  0.007 respectively 8.since broad-spectrum antibiotics can affect 30 of gut microbiota their effect on ici efficacy was retrospectively evaluated in patients having advanced renal cell carcinoma urothelial carcinoma and nsclc and treated with anti-pd1pd-l1.

it can be attributed to a bias in the reconstitution of microbiota in mice using human fecal microbiota transplantation 57.recent report evaluating the microbiome in patients treated with pd-1 inhibitors in metastatic melanoma showed that diversity and composition of gut microbiome was significantly different in patients responding to anti-pd-1 compared with those who do not respond.

antibiotics and the human gut microbiome dysbioses and accumulation of resistances.

in addition the manipulation of the microbiome by broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to increased susceptibility to infections accumulation of antibiotic resistancesderegulated metabolism and compromised immune homeostasis 4.recent reports focused on the role of microbiome in the response to ici.

researchers found that median pfs and os was significantly shorter in patients receiving antibiotics compared with those who do not receive 3.4 vs 5.2 p  0.013 for pfs and 12.2 vs 20.8 months p  0.001 for os.

several candidate biomarkers had been explored including immunological ones such as intratumoral lymphoid infiltrates and intratumoral pd-l1 expression genetic biomarkers like oncogenic mutations mutational load and dna-mismatch repair deficiency 3. recently emerging data show that gut microbiome might affect the efficacy of ici making it a potential biomarker of response.

it was first evaluated in murine models and preclinical studies showed the contribution of gut microbiome in the efficacy of ici.

gut microbiome represents an interesting landscape to explore as predictive marker to immune checkpoint inhibitors with promising preliminary results.

demonstrated that tumor progression of sarcomas in mice housed in specific pathogen-free condition was inhibited with anti-ctla-4 in contrast to mice housed in germ-free gf condition 5. in addition the use of broad- spectrum antibiotics such as colistin and imipenem to eliminate gut microbiata altered the antitumor effect of ctla-4 inhibitors.
