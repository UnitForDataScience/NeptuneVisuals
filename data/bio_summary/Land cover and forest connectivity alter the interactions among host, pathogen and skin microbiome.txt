Furthermore the relative abundance of anti-Bd OTUs did not predict Bd infection loads b 14 28.957 t 14 21.38 p 14 0.168.Our PCoA ordinations unweighted UniFrac distances showed that skin bacterial community composition signifi- cantly differed between Bdth and Bd2 individuals from the best-sampled pond in Araucaria forest PermANOVA F116 14 3.75 R2 14 0.20 p 14 0.002 electronic supplementary material figure S3a with a similar trend in Serra do Mar F110 14 1.53 R2 14 0.15 p 14 0.090 electronic supplementaryPCoA-1u 0.984Figure 4.

Higher Bd loads marginally predicted an increase in the number of anti-Bd OTUs per host b 14 0.567 t 14 1.93 p 14 0.055 though this trend disappeared when con- trolling for Faith's phylogenetic diversity of OTUs b 14 0.229 t 14 0.85 p 14 0.394.

Forest connectivity was also positively correlated with bacterial community simila- rity in Serra do Mar r 14 0.537 p 14 0.019 b while Euclidean distance showed a negative non-significant trend r 14 20.293 p 14 0.071.

In Serra do Mar all indicator OTUs were significantly associated with areas of high natural forest cover electronic supplementary material figure S2 further indicating an ordered loss of amphibian skin bacterial diversity with increasing deforestation.22.520.517.5Bd load logSkin bacterial diversity and Bd across gradients of habitat qualityFaith's phylogenetic diversity of OTUs increased towardsareas of natural forest cover t 14 2.88 b 14 0.026 p 14 0.010 2 electronic supplementary material table S1 both15.012.510.0disturbed vegetationnatural vegetationdisturbed vegetationnatural vegetationrichness and Shannon diversity of OTUs showed a similarAraucaria forestSerra do Marnon-significant trend of higher diversity in hosts from natural habitats electronic supplementary material table S1.

of sampling sites for Serra do Mar 14 929.9  71.4 m for Araucaria forest 14 918.0  10.2 m. For the habitat connectivity analyses among sampling locations we used the national land cover data- base for Brazil 1  50 000 scale shapefiles  and used a binary classification of natural and non-natural land cover.

We coded low resistance pixels raster value 14 1 for natural forest cover and high resistance pixels raster value 14 10 for non-natural vegetation cover.

We found that forest connectivity was positively correlated with bacterial community similarity among amphibian popu- lations from Araucaria forest when Euclidean distance was held constant unweighed UniFrac distances r 14 0.522 p 14 0.018 a.

In this highly disturbed landscape Eucli- dean distance alone had no effect on bacterial community similarity r 14 20.029 p 14 0.436.
