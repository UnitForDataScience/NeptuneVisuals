A single-cell layer of IECs forms a continuous physical barrier with tight junctions connecting adjacent IECs and associating with cytoplasmic actin and myosin networks that regulate intestinal permeability .

Secretory immunoglobulin A sIgA directed against intestinal bacteria and produced by Lipopeptidelipoprotein LP plasma cells binds the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor pIgR and transcytoses across the epithelium to prevent microbial translocation across the epithelial barrier  .

In the colon epithelium for example it was shown that the protective effect of MyD88 is at least in part mediated by the IL-1 cytokine family member IL-18 .The monoassociation of germ-free mice with the prominent gut commensal Bacteroides fragilis revealed that this bacterium specifically signals through TLR2 on regulatory T cell via its polysaccharide A PSA symbiosis factor to enable its niche- specific mucosal colonization .
