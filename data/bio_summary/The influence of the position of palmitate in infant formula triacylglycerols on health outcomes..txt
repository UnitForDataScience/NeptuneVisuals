evaluated the effects of a formula containing high sn-2 palmitate 36 of palmitic acid at sn-2 position an identical formula supplemented with oligofructose at 2 concentrations 3 or 5 gL and a low-sn-2 palmitate formula 12 sn-2 palmitate on stool composition stool characteris- tics and fecal bifidobacteria in term Filipino infants.

Recent studies in infants confirm that formula with a high sn-2 palmitate content reduces stool fat palmitic acid fat soaps palmitate soaps and calcium compared with formula with a low sn-2 palmitate content.

It is concluded that infant formula high in sn-2 palmitate is superior to formula with low sn-2 palmitate but does not fully match human breast milk.

Thus it has been considered that having most palmitic acid in the sn-2 position could play a role in promoting fat and calcium availability and preventing stool hardness and constipation in formula-fed infants .A synthetic TG with palmitic acid in the sn-2 position hasbeen used experimentally for a number of years to study the effect of positional distribution of palmitic acid.

Both fat and calcium were better absorbed by preterm and healthy term infants given formula with a significant proportion of palmitic acid at the sn-2 position compared with formula with little sn-2 palmitic acid but the same total amount of palmitic acid .

Furthermore term infants given formula high in sn-2 palmitate had better fat absorption higher bone mineral content softer stools and lower stool fatty acid calcium soap content than infants receiving formula with palmitic acid not in the sn-2 position .TG with palmitate at sn-1 and sn-3 positions2-Monoacylglycerol  2 Free palmitates-OHO-O-C-RO-O-COLipases-O-C-R O-OHO-O-COAbsorptionCaC-O- Ca -O-COOPalmitate calcium soapReduced palmitate absorption and reduced calcium absorptionHigher fecal fat and calcium harder stools and constipationFig.

Thus in this study infants consuming formula with high sn-2 palmitate had changes in bone strength that were comparable to those of infants consuming breast milk and that were more favorable than the changes seen in infants consuming formula with lower sn-2 palmitate.

examined the effect of formula with high sn-2 palmitate 39 of palmitate compared with low sn- 2 palmitate 13 on gastrointestinal tolerance stool consis- tency and stool fatty acid soap palmitate soap and calcium concentrations in Taiwanese term infants the study also included a group receiving high sn-2 palmitate and oligofructose and a breast-fed comparator group.

Infants received formula with high 44 of palmitic acid in sn-2 position or low 14 sn-2 palmitate or were breast-fed.

Diets were low 12 of palmitate in sn-2 position medium 40 or high 56 in sn-2 palmitate.
