overall these observations support the existence in the transplanted lung of distinct remodeling activities differentially interconnected and regulated in a time-dependent manner.relation between airway microbiota composition and host remodeling gene profilingwe previously reported that the airway microbiota composi- tion varies in concert with bal cell gene profiling posttrans- plantation.in particular we showed that dysbiosis defined by a strong predominance of a single phylum exceeding 70 of rela- tive abundance was associated with a high expression of 2 con- trasting sets of genes linked to either inflammation or remodeling depending on the predominant phylum while more balanced bacterial communities aligned with a neutral gene expression profile.

in this setting bacteria identified in lung transplant recipients on a catabolic remodeling background a mix ofs aureus and p aeruginosa induced a globally distinct remodeling gene expression profile in macrophage-fibroblast cocultures as compared to the representatives of the community linked to anabolic remodeling p melaninogenica and s pneumoniae  a. specifically staphylococcus and pseudomonas induced maximal expression of mmp7 -9 and-12 while prevotella and streptococcus were linked to higher thbs1 expression 2 features aligning with catabolic and anabolic gene expression profiling in bal cells of lung transplant recipients respectively  b. staphylococcus and pseudomonas were more potent in repressing expression of themarker of fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation a-smooth muscle actin along with that of the matrix components collagen type 1 a1and fibronectin 1  b. these divergent gene expression profiles were ultimately reflected by a marked decrease in matrix deposition linked to staphylococcus and pseudomonas versus prevotella and streptococcus exposure as determined by collagen type 1 and fibronectin immunostaining  c and d.consequently this dataset underscored the critical role of bacterial stimulation in the maintenance of homeostatic matrix turnover suggesting that the detrimental impact of airway microbiota dysbiosis following transplantation may consist of exaggerated anabolic or catabolic remodeling processes.discussionthe view of the lower airways representing an ecosystem implies that host cells and the constituents of the microbiota vary in a coordinated manner particularly in the case of a breakdown in local homeostasis.

microbiota composition was characterized using 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing and culture.results we identified 4 host gene expression profiles among which catabolic remodeling associated with high expression of metallopeptidase-7 -9 and -12 diverged from anabolic remodeling linked to maximal thrombospondin and platelet- derived growth factor d expression.

these data highlighted the need to develop an analytical toolkit able to further dissect the complexity of remodeling gene expression profiles posttransplantation.to this end we employed 2 complementary approaches experimental scheme detailed in  a. a subset of 9 bal samples that represented an inflammatory remodeling or intermediate gene expression profile in our first-round real-time pcr was analyzed by rna sequencing.

real-time pcr validation analysis indicated that expression of the selected genes in our initial set of 9 bal samples was associated with a widespread distribution of corresponding eigenvectors as ob- tained by principal component analysis consistent with implications in diverse remodeling-related activities  c. indeed the corresponding encoded proteins have been linked to multiple aspects of remodeling including matrix composition accumulation and degradation.four host remodeling gene expression profiles prevail in the transplanted lungto gain further insight into remodeling gene expression profiles posttransplantation we analyzed by real-time pcr 189 bal samples obtained from 116 patients between 0.5 and 24 months posttransplantation see for details using our new analytical toolkit.

specif- ically pcr amplification of the 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene using phylum-specific primers indicated that dysbiosis observed in 37 of total bal samples was increased when driven by firmicutes or actinobacteria and decreased when bacteroidetes predominated on a catabolic remodeling back- ground  a. moreover sequence analysis at genus level underscored the association of catabolic remodeling with staph- ylococcus corynebacterium stenotrophomonas and haemo- philus  b. in contrast a microbial community comprising prevotella streptococcus veillonella and neisse- ria was poorly represented in this catabolic remodeling context while strongly predominating in association with lowalowanabolicbintermediatecatabolic806040200pc1 37 explainedcthbs1pdgfdmmp7mmp9mmp12  0-1-2-1-2-3-4  -2 -3-4-5  -1  -2-3-4  0  -1-2-3-4low anabolic intermediate catabolic-3-5-6-5-5col6a2fn1igf1spp1chi3l1igfbp2          0   -2 -3-4-5-2  -3-4-5-1   -2-3-2  -3 -4-5-6-1  -2-3-4   -1-2-3-6d10080-6-4e4030anabolic20-7-5-4f4030intermediate2060402000.5-33-6 6-12 12-24catabolic intermediate anabolic lowremodelingprofile10acquisition04030lowremodeling20profileacquisition100remodelingprofile10acquisition04030catabolic remodeling20profileacquisition100months post-transplant0.5-3 3-6 6-1212-24months post-transplant0.5-3 3-6 6-1212-24months post-transplantfig 2. identification of 4 remodeling gene expression profiles in posttransplantation bal samples.

bal samples with catabolic and anabolic remodeling gene expression profiles aligned with maximal and minimal rates of clinical infection respectively  c. moreover when considering all of those samples associated with a clinical suspicion of infection we found a striking difference in the bacteria identified by culture andor type of detected dysbiosis depending on the remodeling context  d. hence combined with the information we obtained on the kinetics of gene expression profiles  d and e and microbiota states  e and f this dataset indicated that the early acquisition of a catabolic remodeling profile and dysbiosis driven by highly stimulatory bacteria is linked to inflammation and a more frequent association with clinical infection.

first although our in vitro dataset revealed a link between remodeling gene expression levels and activities we acknowledge that remodeling in the transplanted lung cannot be inferred solely from the identification of bal cell gene expression profiles given the importance of posttranscriptional regulation in this process.

third given that remodeling gene expression was measured from unsorted bal cells we could not ascertain the cellular source of gene transcripts which would provide information about the underlying pathophysiological processes.
