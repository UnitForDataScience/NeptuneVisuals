Furthermore internal negative and positive controls were always satisfied in all the assays performed by the RLs using the different instruments.NGS analysisTo confirm the presence of the specific gut microbiota on the pos- itive samples and exclude accidental contaminations or real-time PCR artifacts samples identified as positive were tested by NGS whenever sufficient DNA was available for a total of 48 positive samples analyzed.

False negatives were considered all those samples testing negative in used andor not fully sanitized devices false positives were all those samples testing pos- itive in unused andor fully sanitized devices.NGS analysisNGS samples were prepared according to the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation guide part 15044223 rev A Illumina San Diego CA.

Regard- ing the used devices 98 resulted clearly positives and only 1 sample was not amplifiable by any indicator in any of the multiplex am- plification mixes sample 10 s. The majority of samples collected from fully reprocessed colonoscopy devices resulted in clear nega- tives 90.4 whereas in 5 samples mfDNA traces were detected at least 2 markers in at least 2 amplification mixes suggesting aTable 1Multicentric survey summary.

However not all true-positive samples were confirmed by microbiology and or NGS as clean and fully reprocessed samples.

The RL received all supplementary materials for processing the samples including DNA extraction kits QIAmp DNA Mini Kit and DNeasy Blood  Tissue Kit Qiagen Hilden Germany NAO nucleic acids optimizer basket Copan Italia lysozyme solution and glass beads 1 spiked sample as an internal positive control the Microsan-F Kit MDD University Spin Off Viterbo Italy containing standardized amplification mix with aliquots of positive and negative controls and the protocol.

The comparison of the protocols and the optimization tests were performed preparing mock contaminated swabs about 104 CFU using a solution from fecal samples or a pure culture of Enterococ- cus faecalis ATCC 7080.Protocol 1 has been described elsewhere but appeared too labor- and time-consuming for routine surveillance.

The spiked samples consisted of 100 mL fresh bacterial suspension of E faecalis corresponding to 105 CFU spotted on nylon swabs and sent from the Coordinating Laborato- ry Unit to each RL.

The performance of mfDNA analysis in the interlaboratory exper- imental study and in the multicenter survey was calculated in terms of sensitivity specificity false positive and false negative rates ef- ficiency and selectivity as follows sensitivity aa  b specificity dc  d false positive rate ca  c false negative rate bb  d efficiency a  dn and selectivity Log10 a  ca  b  c  d where a is the number of true positives b is the number of false posi- tives c is the number of false negatives d is the number of true negatives and n is the number of samples.

The optimized protocol was easily and successfully applied in all laboratories and both DNA extrac- tion and amplification steps were validated.In-field multicenter surveyA total of 111 samples from colonoscopy devices including used devices n  59 and fully reprocessed endoscopes n  52 were col- lected by the 10 PUs and processed by the 5 RLs.
