No difference in vertebrate viral diversity was observed between individuals with or without enteric GVHD P  0.98 but decreased richness at the species level was observed during the first few weeks following transplantationFigure 1 Collection of stool samples for virome analysis according tostage of enteric GVHD.

In addition herpesvirus reactivation was not predictive of subsequent develop- ment of enteric GvHD P  0.68 and P  0.84 for CMV and HHV-6 reactivation respectively as analyzed using a time-dependent Cox proportional-hazards model despite more frequent detection of cytomegalovirus viral load 3.5 log10 IUml and human her- pesvirus 6 HHV-6 in blood from individuals with enteric GVHD P  0.04 and P  0.0001 respectively.

Similarly the development of GVHD was not correlated with viral host type except for viruses of plants which were associated with a lower risk of GVHD of any type Supplementary Table 9.Among all eukaryotic viruses only the detection of PBV was pre-dictive of later development of GVHD both enteric and of any type HR  1.75 95 CI  1.07-2.85 P  0.02 with a stronger asso- ciation for severe enteric GVHD of stage 2 or higher HR  2.66 95 CI  1.46-4.86 P  0.001 Supplementary Table 9.
