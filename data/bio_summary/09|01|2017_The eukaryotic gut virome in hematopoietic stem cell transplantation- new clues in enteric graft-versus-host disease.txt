although previously investigated in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases or solid-organ transplants virome dynamics in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct and enteric graft-versus-hostdisease gvhd remain unexplored.

these results reveal a progressive expansion of vertebrate viral infections over time following hsct and they suggest an unexpected association of picobirnaviruses with early post-transplant gvhd.viruses arising mainly from the herpesviridae and adenoviridae families have been reported to be frequently linked to enteric gvhd.

broad surveillance approaches are needed to capture these changes given the high degree of viral-sequence diversity and continual dis- covery of novel viruses in human stool by metagenomics.in this study we characterized the profile and longitudinal evolu- tion of the human eukaryotic gut virome in individuals before and after hsct to investigate potential links between changing viral dynamics and the development of enteric gvhd .
