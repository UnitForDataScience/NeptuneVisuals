The micropillar chip with bacterial cells was then immediately stamped onto the microwell chip containing 800 nL of in vitro TNT reaction solutions and the stamped chip was incubated for 3 h. The micropillar chip with bacterial cells challenged by the cell lytic enzymes synthesized from in vitro TNT was moved into the microwell chip containing BHI medium.

2008.Bacterial Cell Staining and Chip ScanningAfter growing the bacterial cells in the micropillarmicrowell chip the micropillar chip containing bacteria cells was stained for 15 min in the dark using LIVEDEAD1 BacLightTM Bacterial Viability Kit ThermoFisher.

At the end of a 1 h incubation period the chip was stained with a bacterial LiveDead staining dye ThermoFisher for 15 min in the dark.Western Blot AnalysisWestern blotting was performed after collecting multiple replicates of in vitro TNT reaction solutions in microwell chip.

A Layout of microwell chip containing different concentration of three cell lytic enzymes and micropillar chip containing four different pathogenic bacteria for quantitative evaluation of their pathogen-specific antimicrobial activities.

This bacterial cell chip is sandwiched or stamped with a complementary microwell chip that contains lysins in 800 nLwell buffer solution.

The bacterial cell chip treated with lysostaphin was then stamped into a new microwell chip filled with brain heart infusion BHI medium and incubated for additional 1 h which was sufficient to reach 12000 cellsspot Supplemen- tary Fig.

We then sequentially stamped the micropillar chip with four different pathogenic bacteria into the microwell chip containing all 11 cell lytic enzymes and the negative control TNT mixture containing plasmid carrying the gene encoding GFP pT7-GFP to evaluate their bacterial-specific antimicrobial activities Fig.

2015.We herein demonstrate a bacterial cell chip platform for rapid quantitative sensitive and high-throughput functional analysis of putative lysins for targeting S. aureus B. anthracis and L. innocua which combines bioinformatics analysis and chip-based in vitro TNT.

For these reasons there is significant interest in developing safe and selective routes to target and decontaminate these bacterial pathogens.The in vitro TNT-coupled bacterial cell chip can be used to screen rapidly plasmid libraries and assess potentially useful yet poorly soluble lysins that are not easily expressed in E. coli expression systems.

In addition species-specific antimicrobial activity can be quantified rapidly in the bacterial cell chip to compare potencies of the lysins toward different target bacteria which may be translated to pathogen-specific therapies.Materials and MethodsBacterial Strains Media and Growth ConditionsBacillus anthracis Sterne 34F23 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33807 Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 S. epidermidis ATCC 12228S.
