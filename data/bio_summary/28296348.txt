in contrast in the current study participants were only required to restrict their diet of brassica vegetables and other glucosinolate-containing foods.while analysis of the bacterial communities with the use of the unifrac metric indicated the brassica diets were not as- sociated with a change at the community level fig.

faecal microbiota composition was measured in samples collected following 2-wk brassica- free periods consumption of all brassica prohibited and after each diet whereby the only brassica consumed was that supplied by the study team.

the secondary aims are to identify whether the consumption of brassica vegetables is associated with changes to the relative abundance of srb or an alteration to the community structure of the microbiota in the human gi tract.materials and methodsstudy participantsten men and women aged between 18 and 50 years old with a bmi between 19.5 and 30 kgm2 were recruited from nor- wich uk into the brassica dietary study which was run at the institute of food research norwich.

the primary outcome of the study was the difference in abundance of members of lactobacillus in faecal samples collected following the low- brassica and high-brassica interventions within a randomised two-way crossover study.

figure 4g shows that there is little evidence of a difference in the proportions of the genus faecalibacterium a prominent and important member of the human gut microbiota following the consumption of either brassica diet p  0.8473.discussionwe report the results of a randomised crossover study to investigate whether a 2-wk diet rich in brassica vegetables would be associated with an increase in members of the in- testinal lactobacilli or srb or cause other perturbations to the colonic microbiota.

comparisons based on data from nine individuals n  9.figure 4. decreased proportions of the strongly significant members of the bacterial taxa associated with the brassica diets p  0.01 a-e are observed in most of the nine par- ticipants tested after consumption of the high- brassica diet.

however the results from this study indicate that a diet rich in brassica vegetables would not be expected to be associated with gi complaints linked to increased levels of srb.the authors would like to thank dr. jack dainty for per- forming the power calculation for the study.

fermented brassica food products such as sauerkraut and kimchi are particu- larly rich in lactobacillus and a diet rich in brassica may promote lactobacillus growth in the colon.

following an initial 2-wk period in which the participants avoided the consumption of brassica and other foods that contain glucosinolates the participants were allocated to either low-high or high-low brassica diets.
