The increased consumption of Brassica was associated with a reduction in the relative abundance of SRB p  0.0215 and members of the Rikenellaceae Ruminococcaceae Mogibacteriaceae Clostridium and unclassified Clostridiales p  0.01.Conclusion The increased consumption of Brassica vegetables was linked to a reduced relative abundance of SRB and therefore may be potentially beneficial to gastrointestinal health.KeywordsBrassica  Gastrointestinal health  Gut microbiota  Randomised crossover study  Sulphate-reducing bacteriaAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived November 11 2016Revised February 16 2017Accepted February 24 2017IntroductionThere is a growing body of largely epidemiological evi- dence that suggests that diets rich in Brassica vegetables may be associated with multiple health benefits includ- ing a reduction in both the incidence and progression ofCorrespondence Richard MithenAbbreviations ANOVA analysis of variance GI gastrointestinal H2S hydrogen sulphide QIIME Quantitative Insights into Mi- crobial Ecology rRNA ribosomal RNA SRB sulphate-reducing bacteriacancers 1 2.

The secondary aims are to identify whether the consumption of Brassica vegetables is associated with changes to the relative abundance of SRB or an alteration to the community structure of the microbiota in the human GI tract.Materials and methodsStudy participantsTen men and women aged between 18 and 50 years old with a BMI between 19.5 and 30 kgm2 were recruited from Nor- wich UK into the Brassica dietary study which was run at the Institute of Food Research Norwich.

The primary outcome of the study was the difference in abundance of members of Lactobacillus in faecal samples collected following the low- Brassica and high-Brassica interventions within a randomised two-way crossover study.

In contrast in the current study participants were only required to restrict their diet of Brassica vegetables and other glucosinolate-containing foods.While analysis of the bacterial communities with the use of the Unifrac metric indicated the Brassica diets were not as- sociated with a change at the community level Fig.

The study was sup- ported by The Danish Council for Strategic Research as part of the NAT4LIFE project and a strategic programme grant to IFR from the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council BBJ0045451.

The in- formed consent of all participating subjects was obtained and the trial is registered at NCT02291328.Dietary interventionThe study was a randomised two-phase crossover interven- tion study with one phase representing a low-Brassica diet and the other phase a high-Brassica diet separated by a min- imum 2-wk washout period.

The re- sultant data did not support the hypothesis that the increased consumption of Brassica vegetables would be associated with a change in the relative abundance of members of the genus Lactobacillus p  0.8019.Association between Brassica diets and SRBInterrogation of the 16S rRNA dataset revealed the popu- lations of SRB within the gut microbiota of participants.

The results of this study suggest that the high consumption of Brassica vegetables reduced the abundance of SRB.

The response variable was the transformed post-intervention bac- terial proportion and the four explanatory variables were respectively the transformed pre-intervention bacterial pro- portion continuous the participant code n-level categorical where n is the number of participants the study phase two- level categorical first intervention and second intervention and the dietary intervention identifier two-level categorical high-Brassica and low-Brassica diets.

The relative propor- tions of total SRB were observed to range between 0.01 and 0.46 of the total population of bacteria present in each of the 67 faecal samples obtained throughout the study with a geometric mean of 0.056 of the total bacterial population across all 67 faecal samples additional data in Supporting Information Table 1.
