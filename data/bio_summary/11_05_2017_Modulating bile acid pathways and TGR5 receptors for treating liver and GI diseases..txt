in a long-term follow-up study of patients with a median time from bile acid diarrhea diagnosis of6.8 years 38 were still on bile acid sequestrants with adequate relief of their symptoms while 24 discontin- ued therapy most commonly due to poor tolerability .fxr agonistobeticholic acid oca a potent fxr agonist that sti- mulates fgf-19 production and decreases hepatic biletherapeutic bile acid modulation malhi and camilleri 83acid synthesis was administered at 25 mg orally daily for two weeks it decreased stool frequency improved stool consistency increased fgf-19 levels and decreased serum c4 and serum bile acids in patients with primary and secondary bile acid diarrhea but not in patients with diarrhea and normal 75sehcat levels .udca reduces clostridium difficile sporulation infection and pouchitisit has been suggested that restoration of secondary bileacid metabolism may be a key mechanism for the bene- ficial effects of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating recurrent c. difficile infection.

similar pharmacody- namics  and clinical effects to those of ileocolonic delivery of cdc were observed with an ibat inhibitor elobixibat in chronic idiopathic constipation .a preliminary study of ngm282 a non-mitogenic variant of fgf19 reported acceleration of colonic transit and relief of constipation in a single-center phase 1 trial in patients with functional constipation .treatment options for bile acid diarrheabile acid sequestrantsabout 25-33 of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ibs-d or functional diarrhea82 gastrointestinalfigure 2bile acid induced fxr and tgr5 signaling in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

there are three currently available bile acid sequestrants cholestyramine powder form colestipol and colesevelam both available in tablet form.the only randomized trial of cholestyramine efficacy in bile acid diarrhea showed response rates of 40 and 53.8 in patients with 75sehcat selenium homocholic acid taurine retention 10 or 20 respectively.

this was associated with a modest weight loss an increase in plasma low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and a decrease in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol which reversed upon discontinuation of drug at study completion.results from a phase 2a trial of the fgf19 analog ngm282 in nash patients showed significant reduc- tion in liver fat alt and serum c4 and increase in serum ldl .accumulated empirical data have shown that loss of intestinal fxr protected high fat-fed mice from hepatic steatosis therapeutic bile acid modulation malhi and camilleri 85increased fecal bile acid loss and altered the bile acid pool to increase bile acids which are agonists to fxr and enhance resistance to high fat diet-induced hepatic stea- tosis and glucose intolerance .

discovery of the tissue distribution and signaling pathways activated by the natural receptors for bile acids farnesoid x receptor and g protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 gpbar1 also known as tgr5 and bile acid transporters has led to the development of therapeutic agents that target these molecules.

the primary bile acids produced in the liver are cholic acid ca and chenodeoxycholic acid cdca which are conjugated with taurine and glycine and are excreted into bile and stored in the gallbladder  after food ingestion the gallbladder contracts delivering bile acids into the small bowel and facilitating digestion and absorption of fat.

theunabsorbed  5 ca and cdca reaching the colon are deconjugated by bacterial bile salt hydrolases and 7a- dehydroxylated by bacteria to secondary bile acids pre- dominantly deoxycholic acid dca and lithocholic acid lca.

these two pathways constitute the major negative regulators of bile acid synthesis .g-protein coupled bile acid target receptorthis receptor also called takeda g-coupled receptor 5 tgr5 is located on cholangiocytes the epithelial sur- face of gallbladder and intestinal cells the basolateral surface of smooth muscle neural cells brown adipose tissue immune cells including dendritic cells and macro- phages and enteroendocrine cells that produce glucagon- like peptide 1 glp-1 .

of the natural bile acids chenodeoxycholic acid cdca most potently activates fxr leading to the induction of small heterodimer protein shp and inhibition of cytochrome p450 cyp 7a1 and cyp8b1 and negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis from cholesterol.

bsep bile salt export pump.have evidence of bile acid diarrhea  sequestrants bind bile acids and decrease diarrhea in bile acid diarrhea.

cholestyramine is unpalatable and associated with bloat- ing hence compliance is low .in an open-label trial in patients with bile acid diarrhea with 75sehcat retention 20 colestipol reduced stool frequency and ibs severity score .in another open-label study in patients with high 48-hour stool bile acid excretion colesevelam 1875 mg twice daily for 10 days decreased stool consistency and increased stool excretion of sequestered bile acids .

colesevelam also slowed emptying of the ascending colon compared with placebo in ibs-d the treatment effect was associated with baseline serum c4 which reflects the hepatic bile acid synthesis rate .further controlled trials are necessary to assess the effects of bile acid sequestrants for diarrhea.

in the poise trial only 4 of patients discontinued oca due to pruritus most in the 10 mg dosage group.ibat inhibitorsin a phase 2a 14-day trial in pbc patients the ibat inhibitor gsk2330672 reduced pruritus and the serum total bile acid by 50s and increased serum c4 about 3-fold consistent with impaired reabsorption and increased fecal bile acid losses.

obeticholic acid a selective fxr agonist and ngm282 a non- mitogenic fgf-19 analog are two of the agents in this pipeline.
