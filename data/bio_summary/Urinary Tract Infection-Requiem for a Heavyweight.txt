The biological plausibility of a sterile urinary tract is quite low.InfectionThe urinary tract resembles the respiratory tract also an open system from alveolus to nose and mouth.

Invasive bacterial diseases such as bacteremic bacteriuria and pyelonephritis arise in the urinary tract and like pneumonia in the respiratory tract can be lethal without antibiotic treatment.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis rarely progresses tosevere disease even if untreated thus the primary goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms.13 The situation is fluid with frequent spontaneous resolution of bacteriuria and of symptoms.814 The generally benign other than symptoms nature of 'symptomatic UTI' is suggested by the billions of persons around the world and over the eons who have suffered 'UTI' without access to antibiotics and have recovered fully.15Asymptomatic BacteriuriaPregnant women and individuals scheduled to undergo invasive urinary tract procedures benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Pyuria accom- panying bacteriuria is not an indication for antimicrobial treatment.3CURRENT TREATMENTAcute Uncomplicated CystitisAntibiotic treatment for individuals with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria is standard of care but five random- ized placebo-controlled trials show no benefit beyond modestly faster symptom improvement.10 In the two trials that reported episodes of pyelonephritis and in a separate metaanalysis of five antibiotic treatment trials the inci- dence of pyelonephritis was low and approximately the same in individuals receiving placebo as in those receiving antibiotic treatment.11 A randomized trial of approxi- mately 500 women younger than 65 compared ibuprofen with fosfomycin for treatment of acute cystitis.

Decision- making with or on behalf of long-term care residents with bacteriuria who develop delirium should also include dis- closure of the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in stable residents the corresponding likelihood that the bacteriuria is coincidental lack of evidence of benefit from treatment risks imparted by treatment and consistent expert advice counselling against treatment.

The urinary tract vir- ome4 for example is ignored in clinical decision-making but may be as important to UTI as the respiratory tract virome is to upper respiratory infection.CURRENT DIAGNOSISBacteriuriaCultures done on agar-based media used since the 19th century to determine presence or absence of bacteria areJAGS 651650-1655 2017c 2017 Copyright the AuthorJournal compilation c 2017 The American Geriatrics Society0002-86141715.00Table 1.

The question-naire asked about lower urinary tract symptoms other thanBacteriuria and urinarysymptomsUTI refers to significant bacteriuria in apatient with symptoms or signs attributable to the urinary tract and no alternate source.

No differences in symptoms were found when bacteriuric subjects were com- pared with themselves when they were nonbacteriuric ... bacteriuria without dysuria in the elderly seems to be asymptomatic.8Urinary tract symptoms do not reliably indicate riskUrinary symptomsstudy to describe the course of lowerurinary tract infection .. .

Emphasizing the microbiome's significance and using the term urinary tract dysbiosis instead of UTI might also help and might encourage mindful study of the relation- ships among host aging microbiome disease and antibi- otic treatment.
