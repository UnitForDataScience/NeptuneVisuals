Thus genetic susceptibility to inflammation promotes colon but not small intestinal tumorigenesis in SPF ApcMinthIl10-- mice while age appears to be the primary factor contributing to small intes- tinal tumorigenesis in SPF ApcMinthIl10-- and ApcMinth mice.Due to its role in promoting cellular proliferation we evaluated the distribution of nuclear catenin beta 1 CTNNB1 and prolif- erating cell nuclear antigen PCNA in actively inflamed and neoplastic regions of ApcMinthIl10-- and ApcMinth colons.

Taken together these data suggest that the heightened inflammatory and proliferative state observed in ApcMinthIl10-- compared with ApcMinth mice increased propensity for colorectal tumor formation and progression.Differential microbial composition within ApcMinthIl10-- mice correlates with tumor multiplicity and inflammation statusWe previously showed that inflammation altered microbial composition 17 a condition important for colorectal cancer development.

There- fore the microbial community composition is correlated with higher tumor numbers and inflammation suggesting specific bacteria play a role in the development of colon inflammation and tumorigenesis in ApcMinthIl10- mice.Bacteria are essential for development of colon tumorigenesis in ApcMinthIl10--miceTo stringently evaluate the impact of bacteria on colorectal cancer development we derived ApcMinthIl10-- and ApcMinCancer Res 7710 May 15 20172623Tomkovich et al.Figure 2.ApcMinthIl10-- mice have increased colon proliferation and inflammation.

Interestingly endpoint age see Materials and Methods for description of the chosen endpoint age range was a significant contributor to tumorigenesis in the small bowel of both ApcMinthIl10-- andApcMinth mice r 0.6458 0.8208 respectively P  0.0001 but only weakly contributed to neoplasia in the large bowel of ApcMinthIl10-- mice r 0.2561 P 0.0256 Fig.

Furthermore ApcMinthIl10-- mice with a high number of tumors 2 had significantly increased levels of TNFa IFNg and IL1b mRNA compared to low tumor number  2 ApcMinthIl10-- mice Fig.
