interest- ingly approximately 13 of these genera 1026 were signif- icantly increased in mice with colon tumors andor inflamma- tion while approximately 23 were decreased 1626. there- fore the microbial community composition is correlated with higher tumor numbers and inflammation suggesting specific bacteria play a role in the development of colon inflammation and tumorigenesis in apcminthil10- mice.bacteria are essential for development of colon tumorigenesis in apcminthil10--miceto stringently evaluate the impact of bacteria on colorectal cancer development we derived apcminthil10-- and apcmincancer res 7710 may 15 20172623tomkovich et al.figure 2.apcminthil10-- mice have increased colon proliferation and inflammation.

overall these findings show that apcminthil10-- mice are sen- sitive to microbial status and develop site specific tumors with colibactin-producing e. coli but not fadath fap2-th f. nucleatum enhancing colon tumor development.discussiongenetics and environmental factors play an important role in colorectal cancer development with increasing attention directed toward the intestinal microbiota as a key environmental component 26. in general the microbiota is thought to play a procarcinogenic role in colorectal cancer with numerous colorec- tal cancer mouse models demonstrating tumor reduction in antibiotic treated or gf mice 27. here we utilized gnotobiotic apcminthand apcminthil10-- mice to define the relationship between inflammation microbial status and tumorigenesis.

nevertheless these studies suggest that small intestine cancers with a relatively low lifetime risk are driven by intrinsic risk factors while 82.9 of the mutation signa- tures in colorectal cancers are from extrinsic factors correlating with a much higher lifetime risk 46. we postulate that one of the extrinsic factors contributing to colorectal cancer risk is the microbiota which not coincidentally is also affected by life- style and environmental factors 48 49. interestingly the concentration of bacteria increases along the gastrointestinal tract with 103-104 bacteriaml in the small intestine to 1011 bacteriaml in the colon mirroring the distribution of cancer risk along the human intestinal tract 50. similarly in the apcminthil10-- model age strongly correlates with small intestine tumor numbers while inflammation and bacteria composition play a strong role in colon tumorigenesis.

gnotobiotic experi- ments revealed that e. coli colibactin but not f. nucleatum fada and fap2 adhesins promote colon tumorigenesis suggesting an intricate interaction between host genetics and bacteria.we observed an inflammation-dependent increase in colon tumorigenesis in 129 svev apcminthil10-- mice which is in line with previous reports on il10-deficient c57bl6 apcminth and apcd468 mice 13 14. however in the small intestine compartment tumors developed at a comparable rate regard- less of il10 status in apcminth mice which is in contrast to previous findings showing a delay in small intestinal polyp formation in il10 deficient apcd468 mice 15. possible expla- nations for the differences in small intestine tumor formation may be due to genetic background differences that have been shown to strongly modulate tumor multiplicity particularly in the small intestine of apcminthmice 28. nevertheless our findings that apcminthil10--and apcminth small intestine tumor development significantly correlated with age but notcancer res 7710 may 15 20172629tomkovich et al.inflammation suggest that age-related factors are a primary driver of small intestinal tumorigenesiswe observed changes in the abundance of 26 genera that correlated with colon inflammation andor tumor number.

thus genetic susceptibility to inflammation promotes colon but not small intestinal tumorigenesis in spf apcminthil10-- mice while age appears to be the primary factor contributing to small intes- tinal tumorigenesis in spf apcminthil10-- and apcminth mice.due to its role in promoting cellular proliferation we evaluated the distribution of nuclear catenin beta 1 ctnnb1 and prolif- erating cell nuclear antigen pcna in actively inflamed and neoplastic regions of apcminthil10-- and apcminth colons.

our results suggest a distinct etiology of cancers in different locations of the gut where colon cancer is primarily driven by inflammation and the microbiome while age is a driving force for small intestine cancer.
