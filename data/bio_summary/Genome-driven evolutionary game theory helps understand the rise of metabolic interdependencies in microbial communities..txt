What prevents 00 11 from being a Nash equilibrium here One of the conditions for 00 11 to be a Nash equilibrium is that in the presence of 11 the fitness of the non-producer 00 should be higher than any of the partial producers 01 and 10 as one would intuitively expect because 00 does not incur the production cost of the two amino acids.

for arginine and glutamate and glycine and threonine see below.For the first anomalous pair arginine and glutamate Nash equilibria in the sustainable leakiness region includes 10 11 and 00 11 but not the cross-feeding state 01 10 Fig.

the sustainable leakiness region with 00 11 and 01 10 as Nash equilibria.

By perform- ing a number of targeted in silico invasion experiments see Methods we found that this depends strongly on the initiala4030f  99f  13f  13f  13b20100010203040lys leakiness level Time hTime h010203040lys leakiness level Time hc403020100010203040lys leakiness level Time hTime hFig.

01 10 is the only viable association excessive leakiness in this region makes the full producer 11 non-viable e.g.

a gene whose modification affectsmore than one metabolic phenotype and illustrates how core biochemistry can impact ecological interactions.A more complex scenario occurs for the glycine and threonine pair where cross-feeding 01 10 is the only Nash equilibrium that emerges in the sustainable leakiness region Fig.

00 01 10 and 00 01 10 11 are possible as well.

This models an alternative scenario for the two-step loss of leaky functions leading to stable cross-feeders Two partial producer mutant genotypes 01 and 10 simultaneously originate from 11 followed by the rise of the 00 genotype from 01 andor 10 in a later stage.

These alternative out-comes include the Mutually Beneficial game where producers dominate and the Snowdrift game where producers and non- producers coexist.We constructed the in silico producer and non-producer strains using the iAZ900 yeast metabolic model and inferred the Nash equilibria of the system as a function of the glucose fructose capture efficiency and the invertase production cost seeMethods and Supplementary Methods for details of flux balance analysis formulations to estimate the payoffs.
