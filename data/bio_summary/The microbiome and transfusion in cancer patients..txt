the distribution of 16sdna spreads over a broad range among donors and most of the blood bacte- rial dna was located in the bc 93.74 whereas rbcs contained more bacterial dna 6.23 than the plasma 0.03. blood frac- tions contain bacterial dna mostly from the proteobacteria phylum more than 80 but also from actinobacteria firmicutes and bac- teroidetes and among the taxa that are significantly more present in rbcs at least seven are genera acinetobacter escherichiashigella corynebacterium pseudomonas staphylococcus stenotrophomonas and shewanella containing species that are pathogens known to infect human blood the blood microbiome therefore is derived at least partially if not mostly from the gut microbiome as a result of several mechanisms of bacterial translocation it should be kept in mind that bacteria identified as blood micro- biome could however result from artefactual contamination from reagents or the introduction of bacterial contaminants dur- ing phlebotomy and sample manipulation interestingly an association between the abo blood group andthe human intestinal microbiota composition was reported where the microbiota from the individuals harbouring the b antigen secretor b and ab differed from the non-b antigen groups and also showed higher diversity of the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides erec and clostridium leptum clept groups in com- parison to other blood groups.the impact of the microbiome can possibly affect blood directly through our blood microbiota but also indirectly through the inter- play of the gut and body microbiota and the immune system resulting in enhanced immunogenicity of specific donor units or enhanced or suppressed reactivity in specific recipients.microbiotamicrobiome and immunitydysbiosis can modulate the host's innate and adaptive immune system according to the hygiene hypothesis gnotobiotics the rearing of animals under germ-free conditions with or without subsequent exposure at various stages of postnatal life or adult- hood to a microbial species or species consortium results in an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases.

however it has not been fully established whether these changes are induced by an inhibition of vitamin k production by intesti- nal microorganisms alone or by an inhibitory action of these antibiotics on endogenous vitamin k metabolism as well any compositional or functional disturbance of the microbiota defined as dysbiosis is associated with a wide variety of morbidities rang- ing from inflammation to obesity and from cardiovascular disease to autoimmunity and cancer with improved bacterial culture methods as well as the use of next generation sequencing techniques recent research demon- strated that bacteria including many known pathogens can remain dormant in blood and within blood cells a plethora of non-communicable diseases in all aspects of medicine have been shown to be associated with a non-negligible bacterial component sometimes detectable in blood this new paradigm--thathealthy individuals harbour a rich microbiota in their blood--raises the question of the role of this microbiota and its impact on the risk associated with blood transfusion in their elegant study conducted on 30 healthy blood donors paisse et al.

1. the microbiota and immunity either directly or indirectly through the effect of the microbiota on nutrients metabolites and micronutrients the immune the humoral and adaptive immune systems are modulated with activation of the complement cascade.ride biosynthesis by the gut microbiota promotes inflammation and immune priming micronutrients and vitaminsa wide variety of vitamins are synthetized by the intestinal microbiota.

the introduction of metabolomics and proteomics omics to transfusion medicine will allow for a better understanding of the donorhost variability and the role played by the microbiome.it is likely that our microbiota affect the immune system shaping the antigenicity and potentially contributing to transfusion-related immune modulation trim as well as potential transmission of infection by donors.

even more children with microbiota that produce poorly immunogenic lipopolysaccharides are more at risk for autoimmunity it is known from metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiotamicrobiome that early postnatal envi- ronment exposures are crucial in determining the phylogenetic structures of adult microbiota that are fully assembled by three years and often shared by family members microbiota can affect the immune system as a result of cross reactivity of its structure with self-antigens by directly affecting the immune system as a result of some of their molecular patterns or through nutrients and micronutrient alterations or through the stimulation of cytokines and hormonal mediators antigen cross-reactivityin view of the huge diversity persistent colonization and high load of our microbiota it is logical to presume that sharing peptidesequences between the commensals and the host is likely.

the absorbed tryptophan produced as a microbial protein metabolite is known to affect macrophages sup- presses t cell proliferation interacting with an ido1 target recently is was demonstrated that the microbiota from animal models deficient in caspase recruitment domain family member 9 card9 fails to metabolize tryptophan into metabolites that act as aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr ligands sharing in the inflam- mation and autoimmunity observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease arginine also modulates the immune response during infections leading to suppression of immune reactivity l-carnitine on the other hand is metabolized by gut flora into trimethylamineoxide tmao the level of which is highly associ- ated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease short chain fatty acids scfas are among the most impor- tant microbiota derived nutrients and metabolites.

iron is crucial for bacterial growth as well triggering cytokine productionthe cascade of immune reactions occurring in the context of microbiotahost interaction results in the production of a myriad of cytokines implying crucial immune roles.

furthermorethe virome might trigger the production of interferon-a produc- tion particular microbiota patterns can therefore promote or prevent the host inflammatory immune responses illus- trates the various mechanisms through which the microbiota affect the immune system.quite often endogenous virome will produce nucleic acids capable of triggering interferon-a production.

the microbiota is not only confined to the gut and skin but is also recoverable from blood of healthy donors.the microbiota shape our immune system through cross reactivity with antigens the expression of direct molecular patterns the release of cytokines the effects on nutrients and micronutrients and even through an interplay with epigenetics.

it is likely therefore that a donor's microbiota could alter the antigenicity of blood and its components and potentially contribute to transfusion-related immune mod- ulation trim.

furthermore chemotherapy and radiation induce mucositis that likely results in significant translocation of gut microbiota and abnormal immune reactions to transfused blood.

furthermore the gut microbiota of the donor affects a wide range of immune competent cells and results in the generation of a myriad of cytokines that can be transmitted to recipients and would affect the quality of the blood when stored resulting directly or indirectly in transfusion- related immunomodulation.

in vulnerable cancer patients the newly introduced knowledge of donor blood microbiota and the understanding about the altered recipient's immune response as a result of abnormal gut and skin microbiota will probably push researchers to consider the various methods of pathogen reductionand to revisit transfusion thresholds and consider transfu-sion saving strategies.
