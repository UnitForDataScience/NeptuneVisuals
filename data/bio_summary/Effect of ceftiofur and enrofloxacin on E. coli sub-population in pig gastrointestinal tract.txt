PFGE profiles of cefotaxime-susceptible E. coli strains recovered at different time points in the ceftiofur sub-therapeutic group also displayed a more diverse PFGE profile while within the same isolation point identical clone could be detected Group3b  suggesting that the cefotaxime-susceptible E. coli population changed consistently upon antibiotic treatment.Taken together our results and those of these few previous studies allow us to conclude that resistant organisms in the gut microbiota could well adapt to the GI tract environment and not readily eradicated during antibiotic treatment.

These data suggested that majority of the resistant E. coli in animal GI tract were commensal E. coli while not pathogenic E. coli.

These data suggested that the increase of resistant population of E. coli was mainly due to the transmission of existing CTX-M to other susceptible populations.To check whether the increase in prevalence of cefotaxime- resistant E. coli after ceftiofur treatment was due to clonal expansion of specific strains or transmission of CTX-M encoding plasmids five cefotaxime-resistant E. coli strains recovered from one animal at different treatment time points in each of the ceftiofur therapeutic and sub-therapeutic group were subjected to PFGE analysis.

The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the phenotypic and genotypic changes in the antibiotic resistant sub-population in the gut microbiome in animals before and after encountering different levels of antibiotic stress.Materials and methodsStudy designTo test the effects of the antibiotic treatment regimens on the gut microflora of the test piglets a batch of twenty 30-day-old piglets which were weaned at the same time and supposed to have never been treated with antibiotic previously were obtained from the same pig farm and housed in our animal facility throughout the process of antibiotic treatment experiments.

A total of 21 PFGE patterns were observed among the 27 E. coli strains collected at three different time points without any antibiotic treatment suggesting the very diversified cefotaxime- resistant E. coli existing in the GI tract of the piglets Group G1 .
