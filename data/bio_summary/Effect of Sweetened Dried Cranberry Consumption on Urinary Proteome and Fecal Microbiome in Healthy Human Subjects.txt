a decrease in uromodulin in all subjects and an increase in akkermansia bacteria in most subjects were observed and warrant further investigation.

six of 10 subjects increased the representation of bacteroidetes and 7 of 10 subjects decreased the representation of firmicutes in the total bacteria present.

therefore 8 of 10 subjects had increased or unchanged species diversity approaching statistical significance  p  0.0546875. nine subjects had measurable levels of akkermansia and 7 of 9 had a higher relative abundance of akkermansia in the total bacterial population in the postsample with a p-value of 0.08984375 trending toward significance fig.

in the current study it was neither found to be common to all subjects nor was it found to be significantly different in the subjects in which it was found.

since we assume that the subjects maintained a healthy urinary tract system throughout the trial a decrease in all subjects is an important observation regarding the relationship between uromodulin and urinary tract health.

specifically 610 subjects increased bacteroidetes and 710 subjects decreased firmi- cutes.

2015. of our 10 subjects 9 subjects had detectable levels of akkermansia in both the pretrial state and post-intervention.

baseline urine and fecal samples were collected from the subjects in the fasted 8-12 h state.

the subjects then consumed one serving 42 g of sdc daily with lunch for 2 weeks.

2013 2014. in light of these past studies and the in- crease in consumption of sweetened dried cranberries sdc we determined if the consumption of sdc by healthy human subjects results in detectable changes to the urinary proteomeand the fecal microbiome.cranberries contain proanthocyanidins pacs which im- prove gut barrier function in mouse models anhe et al.2015 pierre et al.

subjects who already reg- ularly consumed cranberry products were excluded.

volunteers disclosed prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as supplements and these were taken into consideration when we selected the study subjects.
