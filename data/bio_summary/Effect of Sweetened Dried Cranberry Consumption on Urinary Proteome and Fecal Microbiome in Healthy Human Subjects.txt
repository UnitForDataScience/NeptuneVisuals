A decrease in uromodulin in all subjects and an increase in Akkermansia bacteria in most subjects were observed and warrant further investigation.

Each bar is the total number of proteins identified in the study the black portion of each bar represents proteins not previously identified while the gray portion represents proteins identified in one or more of the previous works.Table 2. Notable Differences in Pre- Versus Post-trial Proteins in Our Study Sample n  10 SubjectsUniProt KBDescriptionChangeleast 80 of our subjects a high percentage of proteins were only identified in individual subjects 420767 54.76.Twenty-two proteins were found to significantly change  p  0.05 between the pre- and postsamples Table 2.

Seven of these proteins are mapped to GO pathways Table 3.Of the 25 proteins found in all subjects Table 4 three proteins namely the vesicular integral membrane protein phosphoinositide 3-kinase interacting protein 1 and ur- omodulin were observed to significantly decrease in all subjects after the consumption of SDC  p  0.000977.

Six of 10 subjects increased the representation of Bacteroidetes and 7 of 10 subjects decreased the representation of Firmicutes in the total bacteria present.

In the current study it was neither found to be common to all subjects nor was it found to be significantly different in the subjects in which it was found.

Since we assume that the subjects maintained a healthy urinary tract system throughout the trial a decrease in all subjects is an important observation regarding the relationship between uromodulin and urinary tract health.

Specifically 610 subjects increased Bacteroidetes and 710 subjects decreased Firmi- cutes.

Of our 10 subjects 9 subjects had detectable levels of Akkermansia in both the pretrial state and post-intervention.

Baseline urine and fecal samples were collected from the subjects in the fasted 8-12 h state.

The subjects then consumed one serving 42 g of SDC daily with lunch for 2 weeks.
