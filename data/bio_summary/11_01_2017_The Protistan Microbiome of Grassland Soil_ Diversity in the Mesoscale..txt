Again correct identification would be of pivotal prophylactic importance because this oomycete can cause damage to a wide array of plant species in agriculture  Our study of 150 soil samples supports the recent findings of from the analysis of 12 soil samples that oomycotan plant parasites are ubiquitous components of soil protistan communi- ties.As animal parasites ichthyosporeans can playan important role in arable soil  Detecting ichthyosporeans Ichthyophonae and Rhinosporidaceae was previously regarded as problematic using sequencing techniques because of their low environmental abundance  We however detected 5 OTUs clustering 43 UIRs one of which occurs at 64 sites and of this OTU a single UIR with 100 sequence identity to Anurofeca richardsi was identified at 54 of the 150 sites.

We assume several sequences may belong to inactive forms from the soil seedbank which are included in molecular soil studies On the other hand some OTUs with 100 sequence identity may have been represented by more than one species due to conserved sequences Statistical analysis Data for annotated UIRs at class tax- onomic level  80 genus or general OTU taxonomic level  97 and species taxonomic level  99.7 were each converted to presence-absence matrixes binary data to cir- cumvent the effect of inflated abundance.

taxa-area relationships is a central topic in ecology  hypothesized that microbial life is uniformly distributed due to its small size 2 mm and that the 'environment selects' its inhabitants implying high turnover rates  According to this hypothesis local sites are expected to harbor 104 to 107 active indi- viduals of live protist species per gram of soil and a huge number of encysted species in their seedbank representing a signif- icant proportion of global diversity  This implies a moderate slope in the species-area curve resulting from low global species richness and the absence of endemic species for geograph- ically distant sites.

On the other hand lower levels might include con- generic UIRs  Because of the unresolved species concept  and differences in the rates of evolution within the V4 region of the SSU across taxa  we classified UIRs to be an exact match or approximate species taxonomic level when UIRs were identified at 99.7 sequence similarity.

The 97 pairwise identity level commonly used as a binning value for species taxonomic level was used to allow com- parisons with other studies and therefore used as a conservative proxy level to separate genera  UIRs were included up to the final cut- off of 80 pairwise identity a level which stood as proxy for class taxonomic level  and an attempt to avoid false placement in higher taxonomic ranks We only removed very few reads 80 pairwise identity 11 OTUs or 652 UIRs to be exact all other UIRs passing the filter criteria were retained.Based on common blast hit results and pair- wise identity thresholds for UIRs the lineages for these assigned UIRs could be grouped into OTUs for respective taxonomic levels Supplemen- tary Material Fig.

Here we confirm that DNA databases lack a huge amount of protist reference sequences and that protists especially parasitic species are much more diverse than previously thought  All this warrants a robust approach in sequencing analysis with access to dataset-true sequences UIRs as fingerprints for species as an upper limit in addition to database defined OTUs as a lower limit to estimate taxa richness.

Cut-offs represent proxy taxonomic levels of class  80 genus  97 and species  99.7 according to pairwise identity of OTUsUIRs to reference sequences in the PR2 database.richness saturation at97 reference sequence similarity cut-off but only when UIRs clustered to known taxa accession numbers - OTUs in the PR2 database A and not if UIRs alone were used B.

In our study using UIRs revealed up to ten times more taxa than OTUs equaling the expected load per gram of soil 104-107  Para- sites mostly dominant in soil are heterogeneously spread some sequences could be detected across continental distances.

Therefore de novo clustering is still possible for sequences with higher dissimilarity to reference sequences and in contrast to open-reference methods OTUs may contain UIR sequences across several lev- els of sequence similarity or taxonomic ranks.
