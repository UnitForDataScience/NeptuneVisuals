in other words is ac an important determinant of microbial diversity structure function and evolution in microbial ecosystems such as the human gutwhat are the potential functional consequences of ac and phage-mediated bacterial diversification in the gutthe most probable impact of bacteria-phage ac on host health and disease will be via its roles in driving bacterial diversification at the strain level.

i then examine the evidence and discuss the potential role of ac in driving observed patterns of intra- and interindividual variation in the gut microbiome together with detailing the potential functional consequen- ces of such ac-driven microbial variation for human health and disease.towards an understanding of the factors driving microbial diversity in the human gut microbiomethe human gut is host to a diverse and complex microbial ecosystem that plays a fundamental role in health and disease .

more recently a series of studies that combined la and time-shift analysis to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of bacteria-phage interactions in thephyllosphere clearly demonstrated a role for phage-mediated selection on bacterial popula- tions and vice versa in this natural microbial ecosystem .is there evidence for bacteria-phage ac in the gutbacteria and phages are highly abundant in the human gut  and although the potential significance of ac in driving microbial diversification in the gut has yet to be explicitly investi- gated  studies have shown that variation in gene content between strains of many species of gut bacteria is predominantly associated with phage resistance as well as highlighting rapidly evolving clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr-mediated bacteria-phage interactions in the human gut .

in addition within-host coevolution between bacteria and phages may also play an important role in host-microbe interactions and disease processes in the human gut by selecting for microbial phenotypes with altered virulence  key figure.host-microbe interactions the pleiotropic effects of resistance evolution to phages during ac are particularly pertinent to the ability of bacteria to colonise persist in the gut and interact with the host.

moreover this study unequivocally showed that biotic interactions such as interspecific competition compe-tition between the focal host bacterium p. fluorescens sbw25 and other bacteria present in thesoil and the reduced population sizes of both bacteria and phage in soil microcosms compared to that in nutrient broth microcosms did not constrain coevolution .similar experiments have been conducted under seminatural conditions with marine bacteria including cellulophaga baltica mm3 with two lytic phages wsm and wst  and the cyanobacterium synechococcus sp.

even though the consequences of variation at this level on bacterial functionality in the gut remain poorly understood it is evident from the variable efficacy of probiotic strains of single species of bacteria  and variation in virulence of many gut bacteria such as escherichia coli  that many important aspects of bacterial functionality are meted out at the strain level.

nonethelessthe apparent ubiquity of ac in microbial ecosystems together with its ability to generate microbial diversity resulting in novel genotypes with altered functionality indicates that bacteria- phage ac may have profound implications for microbial ecosystem structure and function and gut microbiome research.acknowledgments i thank professor paul rainey dr alex hall and two anonymous reviewers for providing expert opinion and comments on my manuscript.

it is conceivable that direct lysis of bacterial cells in the gut may play an important role in releasing nutrients into the environmentbut the phenotypic changes linked to phage resistance in bacteria may also affect nutrient turnover and flow through different metabolic pathways due to the direct pleiotropic and epistatic effects of resistance evolution see also .for example mutations in genes that affect cell-surface components such as lps and outer- membrane proteins could have a key impact on bacterial metabolic processes due to indirect or pleiotropic effects on a bacterium to uptake key nutrients or substrates.

moreover the possibility for within- host microbial evolution is rarely addressed even though temporal analysis of single individuals clearly shows that the human gut is host to a rapidly evolving and dynamic microbiota.

here coevolved bacteria may play an important role in disease resistance and adaptive immunity via niche exclusion against invading pathogens and also in exposing the host to a range of epitopes such that it serves to 'educate' the host immune system.
