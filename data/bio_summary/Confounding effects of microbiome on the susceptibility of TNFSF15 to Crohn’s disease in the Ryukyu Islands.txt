.We evaluated a genetic effect of each susceptible allele by fitting dominant additive and recessive models to observed genotype frequency with two different meth- ods a logistic regression and a modified genotype relative risk mGRR test Nakagome et al.

The use of population isolates provides the advantage of mapping disease-associated variants due to genetic and environmental homogeneity within an isolated population Danjou et al.

Kyushu were genotyped for 6 SNP sites at the TNFSF15 locus with the overall success rates of genotyping were greater than 99 in RyukyuTable 2 LASSO logistic regression of CD on genetic effect and bacterial abundanceLASSO regression with genetic effect and bacteria at the phylum levelLASSO regression with genetic effect and bacteria at the genus levelExplanatory variablesaCoefficients estimated with the L1 penaltyp valuesb0.05 0.01Explanatory variablesaCoefficients estimated with the L1 penaltyp valuesb0.05 0.01Fusobacteria0.0230.198Gemella-0.0500.008TM7-0.1480.230-SR1-0.1090.399-a Explanatory variables are shown if a coefficient is non-zero under the L1 penalty chosen by the tenfold cross validation see Supplementary Fig.

These results suggest that bacterial com- positions are likely to be stronger predictors on CD than the genetic effect at the TNFSF15 locus.Contributions of the genetic effect at TNFSF15 to bacterial abundanceBecause the SNPs at the TNFSF15 locus showed the sus- ceptibility to CD Table  Supplementary Tables 2-7 the contribution of the genetic effect to CD risk may go through changes in bacterial composition.

Genome-wide association studies GWAS have successfully identified more than 150 genomic regions particularly from European- ancestry populations Barrett et al.

One of the sus- ceptible loci tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 TNFSF15 has been well characterized as the locus of trans- ancestry association between Europeans and East Asians Barrett et al.
