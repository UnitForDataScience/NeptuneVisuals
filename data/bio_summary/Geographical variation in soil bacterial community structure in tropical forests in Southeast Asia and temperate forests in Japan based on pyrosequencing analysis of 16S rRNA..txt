to examine the uniqueness of soil bacterial community structure in bkoman and the effect of salinity on the soil bacterial community structure it would be necessary not only to study other mangrove for- est soils but also to measure salinity in other forest soils in future studies.environmental properties and mechanisms that influence soil bacterial species composition to investigate the association between soil bacterial com- munity structure especially species composition and soil environmental properties pearson's correlation coef- ficient was examined for the 1st and 2nd ordination scores of pcoa table 8. a highly significant correlation was detected between the 1st ordinate values and soil ph with a less strong correlation observed for eight other physi- cochemical properties of soil.

therefore it would be very informative to take into account aboveground plant a-diversity for stud- ies of soil bacterial community structure in future.taken together the results of this study suggest that soil bacterial community structure species composition in particular was influenced significantly by soil physi- cochemical properties mainly ph and salinity which influence bacterial growth by distance effects which might be related to local adaptation evolutionary his- tory from common ancestors and migration of bacterial species among forests and finally by aboveground forest type.

these results suggest that soil bacterial communities in different forests evolve largely independently of each other and that soil bacterial communities adapt to their local environment modulated by bacterial dispersal distance effect and forest type.

this indicated that bacterial composition at the species otu level was largely differentiated by forest especially for bkoman.relative divergence of soil bacterial communities in investigated forests to investigate the differen- tiation of soil bacterial communities distance matrices calculated for all pairwise comparisons of 28 forests 378 pairwise comparisons based on the abundant jaccard index chao et al.

for this purpose we conducted the following analyses 1 comparison of higher taxonomic composition and species diversity among soil bacterial communities geographic regions and aboveground vegetation forest type 2 com- parison of operational taxonomic unit otu occurrence within and between forests 3 examination of the dis- tance effect by testing the correlation between -diversity and direct distance between forests 4 examination of the effect of geographical region and aboveground vegeta- tion forest type on the soil bacterial community com- position and 5 evaluation of the association between a- and -diversities and physicochemical properties of soil.

forest soils in indonesia especially java had the highest bacterial spe-cies diversity while forest soils in singapore had the low- est bacterial species diversity table 4b.

as for the for- est type as noted above the mangrove forest bkoman had exceptionally high bacterial species diversity and mixed dipteroparp forests which may be considered natural forests with minimal human activity had lower diversity than acacia and oil palm plantations which are artificial forests with a single tree species table 4c indicating that aboveground tree composition was not strongly related to forest soil bacterial diversity.

actually in the japanese forests ashiu and ibulim 1- the percentage of forest- specific otus which is the percentage of otus in a for- est shared with other forests was 0.575 and 0.3 table 3 respectively indicating that a high percentage of otus injapanese forests were shared with the southeast asian forests given that the -diversity estimates between the two japanese forests were relatively high table 5.although it was not clear from the average values of-diversity table 5 permanova tests also indicated that aboveground forest type has a significant influence on soil bacterial species composition -diversity table 6 indicating that forests with the same forest type are likely to have similar soil bacterial composition.

this indicates that the overall conclusion with respect to soil bacterial species diversity was not influenced by sequence read variation and that tropical forests did not necessarily have higher soil bacterial spe- cies diversity than temperate forests in japan tables 3 and 4a.soil bacterial species diversity also varied according to the geographical area of the soil sample.

4 confirmed by the permanova test for the effect of geographical region on soil bacterial community structure table 6. this implies that the biogeography of soil bacterial compo- sition is non-random such that bacterial composition is influenced by local adaptation and limited dispersal hughes martiny et al.

2013 we also observed a similar composition of higher taxonomic taxa and similar bacterial species diversity in the six forests.the present study investigates bacterial diversity and composition in 28 forest soils based on pyrosequencing analyses of the 16s rrna region.

primary conclusions were as follows 1 among the investigated forests bacterial phyla were represented in similar proportions despite diverse environmental dif- ferences but species diversity differed considerably 2 otu distribution was skewed and forest-specific otus were predominant 3 a significant and positive correla- tion was detected between -diversity and direct distance between forests suggesting local adaptation and bacterial dispersal among forests 4 both geographical region and aboveground vegetation forest type influenced soil bac- terial composition 5 a- and -diversities were correlated with soil ph.materials and methodssoil sampling and dna extraction soil samples were collected from 26 tropical forests in malaysia sarawak indonesia java sumatra and singapore and from two temperate forests in japan in 2010-2011 supplementary fig.

a mixture of fresh water and seawater irrigates the soil in bkoman a mangrove forest and it was reported that salinity influ- ences the structure of bacterial communities lozupone and knight 2007. this could promote growth of salt- tolerant and anaerobic bacteria in bkoman soil contrib- uting to the unique structure of its bacterial community at the levels of phylum and species.
