conversely we did not observe a significant change in the rorgfoxp3 mrna ratio after 30 days in the placebo group 0.8995 iqr  1.146 at day 0 and 0.6887 iqr  0.276 at day 30 p  .19 .furthermore after l reuteri administration for 30 days in the infants with colic we observed a significant increase in the percentage of lactobacillus the medians were 9.49 iqr  15.31 at day 0 and 23.06 iqr  33.19 after 30 days p  .049. placebo administration did not produce any sig- nificant change in the intestinal microbiota indicators all p values were .05 .in addition we observed a decrease in the fecal calprotectin values p  .0001 the medians were 541 ugg iqr  429.5 at day 0 and 165 ugg iqr  246.8 at day 30. moreover placebo administration did not significantly reduce the calprotectin values p  .23 the medians were 361 ugg iqr  376.5 at day 0 and 182 ugg iqr  321.5 at day 30.we also compared children with colic n  32 with a group of healthy children n  27. no significant difference in the rorgfoxp3 mrna ratio was observed between groups.

gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin were evaluated.results after infants with colic were supplemented with l reuteri dsm 17938 for 30 days crying times were sig- nificantly shorter among infants with colic in the probiotic group compared with infants in the placebo group 74.67 - 25.04 iqr  79 minutes day vs 147.85 iqr  135 minutes day p  .001. the foxp3 concentration increased sig- nificantly p  .009 resulting in decreased rorgfoxp3 ratios 0.61 iqr  0.60 at day 0 and 0.48 iqr  0.28 at day 30 p  .028. furthermore the probiotic increased the percentage of lactobacillus p  .049 and de- creased fecal calprotectin p  .0001.conclusions infants with colic treated with l reuteri for 30 days had a significantly decreased crying time andan increased foxp3 concentration resulting in a decreased rorgfoxp3 ratio.

at enrollment day 0 the average crying time per day minutesday was similar in the 2 groups 299 minutes day iqr  115 in the first group treated with the probiotic vs 305.4 minutesday iqr  133 in the second group treated with the placebo p  .191. infants treated with l reuteri showed a significant reduction in the daily crying time at the end of the study day 30 74.67 - 25.04 iqr  79 minutes day vs 147.85 iqr  135 minutesday in infants adminis- tered the placebo p  .001. although the daily duration of crying decreased over the study period in both groups the decline at 1 month was greater in the probiotic group than in the placebo group .

moreover some studies thus far conducted only in vitro or in animal models have also demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect of l reuteri which could at least partly explain the clini- cal effect.despite growing data confirming the clinical ef- ficacy of l reuteri on colic in breastfed infantsthe role of this bacteria remains under investigation.in this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial we in- vestigated whether supplementation with the probiotic l reuteri dsm 17938 for 1 month could reduce the crying time and modify the rorgfoxp3 expression gut microbiota or fecal calprotectin level in a group of infants with colic.

the parents of the chil- dren who received the probiotic all recorded an average score of 8.34 whereas the parents of the placebo group reported a low score with an average of 4.14 p  .00001.after supplementation with l reuteri dsm 17938 for 30 days in the infants with colic the foxp3 concentration increased significantly p  .009 resulting in decreased a rorgfoxp3 mrna ratio 0.61 iqr  0.60 at day 0 and 0.48 iqr  0.28at day 30 p  .028  available at .

con- versely in terms of the gut microbiota we observed that the absolute number and percentage of e coli had medians of 266.1 genomemg feces iqr  18.28 and 2.91 iqr  15.54 re- spectively in the colic group whereas in the healthy control group the median e coli concentration was 66.15 genome mg feces iqr  1238.75 and the median percentage was 0.40 iqr  4.23. among all analyzed indicators there were significant differences in the absolute number p  .0193 and the percentage p  .0085 of e coli.

the effects on treg lymphocytes could result from increased il-10 secretion which is a criti- cal cytokine in determining the differentiation of lympho- cytes into treg cells il-10 secretion is reduced not only in colitis models but also in children with colic.furthermore we showed that the administration of l reuteri was associated with a significant decrease in the fecal calprotectin level which is a clinical marker of intestinal in- flammation in both adults and children.regarding the gut microbiota we showed that in children with colic after a 1-month administration of l reuteri a sig- nificantly increased lactobacillus percentage was evident in the total bacterial count.

the l reuteri dosage was the same dosage used in our previous trials which showed effective management of colic.randomization allocation concealment blinding infants with colic were randomly assigned to receive l reuteri dsm 17938 or placebo using a computer-generated random- ization list created by an independent statistician.

after the visit we collected 2 fecal samples and atube of peripheral blood in a routine manner.the children were divided into 2 groups based on the clini- cal examination and the wessel criteria as follows infants with colic n  60 and healthy control infants n  27. the parents were asked to complete a cry and fussing diary in which they recorded the frequency of colic episodes and the daily crying and fussing time in minutes.in the group of infants with colic 32 infants received supple- mentation with l reuteri dsm 17938 and the remaining 28 infants were given the placebo.

a hospital pharmacist assigned a study identifica- tion number to each enrolled infant and dispensed the study product according to the randomization schedule.the primary outcome was evaluated based on changes in the crying time per day in a group of infants with colic at the time of allocation and after supplementation for 30 days with l reuteri dsm17938 or the placebo.the secondary outcomes were to determine the rorg th17 cell marker and foxp3 treg marker messenger rna mrna expression levels and their ratio and to evaluate the gut microbiota and the value of fecal calprotectin after ad- ministration of the probiotic or the placebo.

infant responders were signifi- cantly higher in the l reuteri-treated group than in the placebo group p  .004. at day 30 we asked the parents to com- plete a questionnaire concerning their degree of satisfaction assessment of quality of life scale melbourne australia where the minimum score was 1 not satisfied and the maximum was 10 very satisfied.

moreover e coli is a potential producer of inflamma- tory lipopolysaccharide which may be associated with the in- flammation present in infants with colic.furthermore we observed that infants with colic presented significantly higher levels of fecal calprotectin which was in accordance with the data of rhoads et al.therefore we hypothesized that a local state of inflammation existed in children with colic.walter et alreported that the effects of l reuteri on immune cells contribute to tolerance in the gut.

the fecal calprotectin concentration is primarily used in gastroenterology as a marker for inflamma- tory bowel conditions.rhoads et alobserved increased fecal calprotectin levels in infants with colic.lactobacillus reuteri is a probiotic species with antimicro- bial activity the dsm 17938 strain reduces pain perception via the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channelin- fluences the activity of the potassium-dependent calcium channel intermediate konductance in enteric neurons and serves as a tonic inhibitor of the contractility of the colon.
