Conversely we did not observe a significant change in the RoRgFOXP3 mRNA ratio after 30 days in the placebo group 0.8995 IQR  1.146 at day 0 and 0.6887 IQR  0.276 at day 30 P  .19 .Furthermore after L reuteri administration for 30 days in the infants with colic we observed a significant increase in the percentage of Lactobacillus the medians were 9.49 IQR  15.31 at day 0 and 23.06 IQR  33.19 after 30 days P  .049.

Gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin were evaluated.Results After infants with colic were supplemented with L reuteri DSM 17938 for 30 days crying times were sig- nificantly shorter among infants with colic in the probiotic group compared with infants in the placebo group 74.67 - 25.04 IQR  79 minutes day vs 147.85 IQR  135 minutes day P  .001.

The parents of the chil- dren who received the probiotic all recorded an average score of 8.34 whereas the parents of the placebo group reported a low score with an average of 4.14 P  .00001.After supplementation with L reuteri DSM 17938 for 30 days in the infants with colic the FOXP3 concentration increased significantly P  .009 resulting in decreased a RoRgFOXP3 mRNA ratio 0.61 IQR  0.60 at day 0 and 0.48 IQR  0.28at day 30 P  .028  available at .

Con- versely in terms of the gut microbiota we observed that the absolute number and percentage of E coli had medians of 266.1 genomemg feces IQR  18.28 and 2.91 IQR  15.54 re- spectively in the colic group whereas in the healthy control group the median E coli concentration was 66.15 genome mg feces IQR  1238.75 and the median percentage was 0.40 IQR  4.23.

Finally the average crying time per day minutesday was significantly lower in the healthy group than in the colic group 55.2 minutesday IQR  71 vs299.66 minutesday IQR  115 P  .015 .Mann-Whitney t test.No adverse events were reported by parents during the study in either group of infants.

Moreover some studies thus far conducted only in vitro or in animal models have also demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect of L reuteri which could at least partly explain the clini- cal effect.Despite growing data confirming the clinical ef- ficacy of L reuteri on colic in breastfed infantsthe role of this bacteria remains under investigation.In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial we in- vestigated whether supplementation with the probiotic L reuteri DSM 17938 for 1 month could reduce the crying time and modify the RORgFOXP3 expression gut microbiota or fecal calprotectin level in a group of infants with colic.

At enrollment day 0 the average crying time per day minutesday was similar in the 2 groups 299 minutes day IQR  115 in the first group treated with the probiotic vs 305.4 minutesday IQR  133 in the second group treated with the placebo P  .191.

The children with infan- tile colic had a higher median fecal calprotectin concentra- tion 500 ugg IQR  415 vs 145 ugg IQR  106 in the healthy group P  .0001.

Placebo administration did not produce any sig- nificant change in the intestinal microbiota indicators all P values were .05 .In addition we observed a decrease in the fecal calprotectin values P  .0001 the medians were 541 ugg IQR  429.5 at day 0 and 165 ugg IQR  246.8 at day 30.

Moreover placebo administration did not significantly reduce the calprotectin values P  .23 the medians were 361 ugg IQR  376.5 at day 0 and 182 ugg IQR  321.5 at day 30.We also compared children with colic n  32 with a group of healthy children n  27.
