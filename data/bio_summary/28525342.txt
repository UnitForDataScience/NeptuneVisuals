The effects of sound on animal physiology and behavior depend not only on its intensity or loudness which is measured in decibels dB its fre- quency which is measured in hertz Hz and its dur- ation and pattern including vibration potential but also on the hearing ability of the animal species and strain the age and physiological state of the animal at the time of exposure to what sounds the animal has been exposed during its lifetime noise exposure his- tory of the animal and to the predictability of the acoustic stimulus Clough 1982 Gamble 1982 Voipio 1997 Turner et al.

Meaningful sounds at relatively low-intensity levels can have a considerable impact on animal physiology and be- haviour by engaging limbic structures and higher cen- ters involved in determining context and meaning Turner et al.

Ro- dents not only produce sounds that we can hear but also produce and hear frequencies that are inaudible to humans above 20 kHz perceiving sounds up to 80 kHz Kelly and Masterton 1977 Bjork et al.

The negative impact of building construc- tion noise from demolition and refurbishment on hu- man health is well known Suter 2002 Leensen et al.

Intense noise exposure can damage the cochlea and inner ear and lead to a cascade of auditory effects along the entire central auditory cascade Turner et al.
