Briefly 10 uL of each phage lysate was spotted against the individual mem- bers of the lactococcal strain collection via the double layer agar method as previously described Lillehaug 1997 and a host-range analysis was thus performed for all identified phages.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevalence and Geographical Distribution of Phages from Dairy FacilitiesTo assess phage prevalence in dairy facilities an extensive phage identification and phage-host screen was performed using a large number of whey samples that were individually tested against a collection of 113 industrial lactococcal strains.

Finally the c2-group genomes were concise ranging between20 and 22 kb phage names and relevant information are provided in Supplemental Tables S1 S2 and S3.Several studies investigating phage biodiversity in dairy facilities have been performed and incorporate a vast array of geographical locations including France 19 whey samples screened Ly-Chatain et al.

Among the 10 currently recognized lactococcal phage groups members of the so-called 936 P335 and c2 groups appear to be the most frequently encountered phages in the dairy environment Deveau et al.

This resistance may be due to the activity of anti- phage systems which are known to be abundant among lactococcal strains Emond et al.

Additionally to identify the host receptor used by certain phages and to enable the development of predictive tools and improved strain rotation strate- gies lactococcal strains have been grouped based on the operon that specifies the biosynthetic machinery for the cell wall polysaccharide CWPS produced by the lactococcal host Dupont et al.

Using a previously described method Lillehaug 1997 plaque assays were performed to determine the phage titer for each isolated phage typi- cally 108 to 109 plaque-forming units pfumL and phage stocks were maintained as lysates at 4degC.Phage DNA Extraction and Restriction Profile AnalysisFifty milliliters of GM17 broth was inoculated with a 1 fresh overnight Lc.
