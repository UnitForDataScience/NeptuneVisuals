therefore to assess possible phylogeographi- cal links and relative phage distribution more detailed information regarding the isolation of whey samples source starter culture information origin and dis- tribution is required for future biodiversity studies of dairy phages.phage host-range determinationas mentioned above the host range of the 137 lacto- coccal phages identified in this study was determined by spot assays against a collection of 113 lactococcal strains using a previously described method lillehaug 1997. the resulting host-range data which represent 15481 potential phage-host interactions revealed that 93 lactococcal strains from our collection of 113 were sensitive to at least one phage and 20 lactococcal strains were shown to exhibit complete resistance against all phages assessed in this study figure 2a and table 5. this resistance may be due to the activity of anti- phage systems which are known to be abundant among lactococcal strains emond et al.

phage dna extracts were used as a template for the pcr reactions and the amplification conditions were identical to those described previously labrie and moineau 2000. gen- erated pcr products were subjected to electrophoretic examination as described above.cwps typing of lactococcal strains by multiplex pcrto determine which particular cwps type was as- sociated with the corresponding host range of a given phage a multiplex pcr-based cwps typing method was used as described previously mahony et al.

finally the c2-group genomes were concise ranging between20 and 22 kb phage names and relevant information are provided in supplemental tables s1 s2 and s3.several studies investigating phage biodiversity in dairy facilities have been performed and incorporate a vast array of geographical locations including france 19 whey samples screened ly-chatain et al.

using a previously described method lillehaug 1997 plaque assays were performed to determine the phage titer for each isolated phage typi- cally 108 to 109 plaque-forming units pfuml and phage stocks were maintained as lysates at 4degc.phage dna extraction and restriction profile analysisfifty milliliters of gm17 broth was inoculated with a 1 fresh overnight lc.

the reaction mixture was incubated at 37degc for 15 min and the resulting restriction products were applied to a 1 agarose gel and visualized by using a uv transilluminator.multiplex pcr for phage speciationphage genotyping was performed using a previously established multiplex pcr methodology labrie andtable 1. multiplex pcr primers fw  forward rv  reverse for genotypic characterization of phage isolatesproductmoineau 2000 in which 3 sets of primers based on the species-specific regions of the 3 dominant lactococcal phage groups 936 p335 and c2 primers are listed in table 1 were used.

briefly 10 ul of each phage lysate was spotted against the individual mem- bers of the lactococcal strain collection via the double layer agar method as previously described lillehaug 1997 and a host-range analysis was thus performed for all identified phages.results and discussionprevalence and geographical distribution of phages from dairy facilitiesto assess phage prevalence in dairy facilities an extensive phage identification and phage-host screen was performed using a large number of whey samples that were individually tested against a collection of 113 industrial lactococcal strains.

in this manner we showed that among the 137 lactococcal phages isolated in this study members of the 936 lactococcal phage groups were the most dominant 84137 isolates 61.31. the remain- ing isolated phages belonged to either the p335 group 32137 isolates 23.36 or the c2 group 21137 15.33 table 3.the geographical and phage group distribution pat-terns of these 137 isolated lactococcal phages are shown in figure 1. a large proportion of the identified phages 38 and 20 out of 137 respectively were isolated from whey samples derived from factories in the united states and the united kingdom and contained repre- sentatives of all 3 identified lactococcal phage groups.

representative susceptibility of 113 lactococcal strains to infection by b a collection of 84 isolated phages identified as belonging to the 936 group c a collection of 21 isolated phages identified as belonging to the c2 group and d a collection of 32 isolated phages identified as belonging to the p335 group.files were compared resulting in the identification of 49 distinct restriction profiles among the 936-group phage isolates out of 84 analyzed representative profiles are presented in figure 3. using a similar approach 21 distinct p335 phage genotypes and 12 distinct c2 phage genotypes were identified out of 32 and 21 analyzed respectively figure 4. comparing the intra-group en- zymatic restriction profiles and the accumulated sizes of generated restriction fragments the genomes of the p335-group phages were observed to be the largest fol- lowed in descending order by those of the 936 and c2 groups.

2006 mahony and van sinderen 2014. among the 10 currently recognized lactococcal phage groups members of the so-called 936 p335 and c2 groups appear to be the most frequently encountered phages in the dairy environment deveau et al.

2003 millen and romero 2016. comparative genomic analysis of phages belonging to the p335 group has revealed sig- nificant genetic diversity and the absence of a core genome that is no single gene is conserved among all assigned members of this phage group mahony et al.

polyethylene glycol peg8000 sigma-aldrich st. louis mo was added to a final concentration of 10 followed by incu- bation at 4degc for 16 h. phage dna extraction was per- formed as described previously mahony et al.

equally it is possible that phage recep- tors on the cell surface are absent shielded or altered in these strains providing insensitivity to the phages present in the current collection labrie et al.
