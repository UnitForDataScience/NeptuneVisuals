IL-22 that eliminate the microbiota Do humans and mice who are stressed release host stress-derived compensatory factors that induce Salmonella to express these virulence factors that then determine if and how infection occurs     The last is a particularly important question given that we know that host stress depletes the microbiota activates IL-22   which further can deplete the microbiota releases cytokines that directly signal bacteria to activate their quorum sensing circuits  and diminishes local resources   i.e.

It could be postulated that the intestinal microbiota sense that the host is under duress and decrease their growth rate and metabolism both anticipating that resourceswill be limited and that the host cannot tolerate activation of its immune system by the intestinal microbiota   .

Yet understanding how the microbiota collapse following host stress how the pathobiota emerge to achieve a new state of equilibrium with the host and whether the resilience of the host to achieverecovery depends on the ability of the microbiota to refaunate remains a challenging but important line of inquiry  .IS HOST RECOVERY FROM STRESS DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF THE MICROBIOTA TO REFAUNATEWhile resilience to host injury and recovery from infection is generally attributed to a robust host immune clearance mechanism emerging knowledge in microbiome science suggests that the intestinal microbiome plays a key role in driving a recovery-directed immune response  .
