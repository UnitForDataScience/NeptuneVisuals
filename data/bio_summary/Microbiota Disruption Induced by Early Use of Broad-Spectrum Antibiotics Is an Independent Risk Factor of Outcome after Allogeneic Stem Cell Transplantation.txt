mean urinary 3-is levels between days 0 and 28 after asct indicate signficant long-term suppression of commensal clostridiales by early antibiotic treatment.table 3trm in relation to the beginning of antibiotic treatment for neutropenic fever at the 2 centerstrm was significantly increased in the early ab group compared with the late ab group.

between days 0 and 7 after asct significantly lower copy numbers were found in the early ab group 2.4 x 104 compared with the late ab group 2.6 x 108 p  .005 indicating directly that early antibiotic treatment markedly reduced this subset of com- mensal intestinal bacteria.

the inde- pendent effect of early antibiotic treatment on gvhd- associated trm p  .004 could be demonstrated in a competing risk analysis whereas infection-related trm and relapse were not associated with start of systemic antibiot- ic treatment not significant.table 4multivariate risk factor analysis for trm after asct early initiation of an- tibiotic treatment patient age  40 years karnofsky performance status  90 and donor female-male recipient sex combination were significantly as- sociated with increased risk of trmrisk factorphr95 ci for hrin the early ab 34 79236 compared with the late ab group21 62297. the lowest rate of trm 7 688 was found in patients who had not received additional antibiotic therapy.
