At both centers patients received first- and second-line treatment accord- ing to international guidelines for treatment of neutropenic feverinfections .All patients were classified into 3 groups according to the timing of ad- ditional antibiotic initiation 1 early exposure to antibiotics between days-7 and 0 early AB group n  236 38 2 exposure to antibiotics on day 0 or thereafter late AB group n  297 48 and 3 no systemic antibi- otic treatment during the course of ASCT beyond prophylactic regimens no AB group n  88 14 .

The inde- pendent effect of early antibiotic treatment on GVHD- associated TRM P  .004 could be demonstrated in a competing risk analysis whereas infection-related TRM and relapse were not associated with start of systemic antibiot- ic treatment not significant.Table 4Multivariate Risk Factor Analysis for TRM after ASCT Early Initiation of An- tibiotic Treatment Patient Age  40 Years Karnofsky Performance Status  90 and Donor Female-Male Recipient Sex Combination Were Significantly As- sociated with Increased Risk of TRMRisk factorPHR95 CI for HRin the early AB 34 79236 compared with the late AB group21 62297.

Timing of antibiotic treatment was the dominant independent risk factor for TRM HR 2.0 P  .001 in multivariate analysis besides increase age HR 2.15 P  .004 reduced Karnofsky performance status HR 1.47 P  .03 and female donor- male recipient sex combination HR 1.56 P  .02 A competing risk analysis revealed the independent effect of early initiation of antibiotics on graft-versus-host disease-related TRM P  .004 in contrast to infection- related TRM and relapse not significant.

TRM was highest in the early AB group compared with the late and no AB groups in patients with acute leukemia.DISCUSSIONOur study reveals a novel association between the timing of antibiotic treatment microbiota disruption and outcome after ASCT.

Although these data need to be confirmed by a prospective study compet- ing risk analysis identified the independent interaction of early antibiotic treatment and GVHD-associated TRM whereas early exposure to antibiotics had no impact on infectious TRM.

Between days 0 and 7 after ASCT significantly lower copy numbers were found in the early AB group 2.4 x 104 compared with the late AB group 2.6 x 108 P  .005 indicating directly that early antibiotic treatment markedly reduced this subset of com- mensal intestinal bacteria.

In contrast significantlylower mean urinary concentrations of 3-IS between days 0 and 28 after ASCT were found in the early AB group n  62 mean 5.5 STD 13.6 mmolmmol creatinine than in late AB n  57 mean 9.9 STD 8.2 mmolmmol creatinine P  .001 and no AB groups n  11 mean 11.1 STD 10.5 mmolmmol cre- atinine P  .02 respectively in the Regensburg cohort.

Similarly overall survival was lower in the early 51 121236 than in the late 67 200 297 log rank  .001 and no AB groups 73 6488 log rank  .001 respectively.In the Regensburg cohort we observed a significantly higher rate of death from severe acute andor chronic GVHD in the early 23 44190 compared with the late AB 16 26160 and the no AB groups 3 130 P  .003.
