However the diversity and specificity of nonsymbiotic microbes associated with legume roots their interactions with the symbiotic microbes and their responses to soil conditions and plant growth remain unclear.Therefore the objectives of this study were as fol-lows i to investigate the hierarchical community com- positions of microbes in the four rhizocompartments of legumes - nodule endosphere root endosphere rhizo- sphere and root zone a narrow region outside the rhi- zosphere - providing a spatial gradient to assist in observing the variation in the microbial community from the outer soil to the nodules ii to clarify the structure and composition of legume nodule endo- phytes and iii to illustrate the effects of legumespecies and soil types on the microbial community of each rhizocompartment.Materials and methodsSoil collection and preparationFarmland soil samples representing the main Chinese soil types - chernozem CH Mollisol in Heilongjiang Pro- vince 46deg24010.2''N 125deg21059.5''E cinnamon soils CI Alfisol in Shaanxi Province 34deg4014.88''N 108deg3608.28''E and red earth RE Acrorthox in Jiangxi Province 28deg21041.5''N 115deg5500.80''E - were collected separately.

c d Mean relative abundances  of dominant lineages phylum level in the rhizocompartments nodule root rhizosphere and root zone and bulk soil of soya bean c and alfalfa d. Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.comCompared to that of other rhizocompartments the com- position and structure of microbial communities of the root zone soil were more similar to those of the bulk soil as shown in the Venn diagram Fig.

Substantial components of significantly enriched microbes in nodule c compared with bulk soil root zone soil and rhizosphere soil.

Substantial components of significantly depleted microbes in nodule compared with bulk soil root zone soil rhizosphere soil and root d. Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.comsignificantly enriched in nodules belonged to Ensifer Bradyrhizobium Escherichia Tardiphaga Hydrogenophaga Porphyromonas Gordonia and other genera Fig.

1 The flow chart of the experimental design and the sketch of four rhizocompartments which include nodule endosphere root endosphere rhizosphere soil and root zone soil.

Each time the samples consisted of four rhizocompartments nod- ule root rhizosphere soil and root zone soil Fig.

Finally a total of 234 DNA samples two plant species 9 three soils 9 three periods 9 four rhi- zocompartments 9 three replicates  three bulk soil no plant cultivation 9 three periods  three bulk soil be- fore transplantation 9 three replicates were used for PCR amplification of the V4-V5 regions and the subse- quent metagenomic sequencing Fig.

The Shannon-Weiner index and richness significantly increased in the order of nodule  root  rhizosphere  root zone soil Figs 2a and S3 Tables S3 and S4 Supporting information.Our results showed that there were significant differ- ences in the Shannon-Weiner indexes of the micro- biomes of root endosphere rhizosphere and root zone samples among the soil types Table S3 Supporting information.

ANOSIM revealed a striking difference between the structure of bulk soil and root zone soil microbial communities R  0.1254 P  0.012.

In the pre- sent study the discovery that soil type has a major effect on the soil rhizosphere and root zone microbiome and that the plant species had major effects on the endophytic microbiomes supports the suggestion that niche-related selection of functional groups of microbes causes the fil- tration in rhizocompartments.
