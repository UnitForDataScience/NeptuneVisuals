Outstanding issues include Can gut microbiota protect insects from fungal infection Do microbiota and fungal pathogens interact or do they act independently Can com- mensal gut bacteria become virulent when a fungal pathogen infects an insect Understanding the tripartite interactions between mos- quito host resident microbiota and fungal pathogen may yield newAuthor contributions S.W.

Our findings reveal the important contribution of the gut microbiota in B. bassiana-killing activity providing new insights into the mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis in insects.Anopheles  gut microbiota  dysbiosis  entomopathogenic fungus  immunityosquitoes transmit a wide range of pathogens that cause diseases such as malaria dengue yellow fever and Zika which have a devastating impact on human health 1.

These data show that fungal infection results in translocation of opportunistic bacteria such as S. marcescens from the midgut to the hemocoel where they switch from asymptomatic gut symbionts to hemocoelic pathogens and fa- cilitate fungal killing of mosquitoes.Fungal Infection Down-Regulates Immune Gene Expression in the Midgut.

We propose a model in which a fungal pathogen interacts with the midgut microbiota to accelerate mosquito death via down-regulation of antimicrobial peptides and dual oxidase in the midgut Fig.

Down- regulation of Duox in the midgut may cause the opportunistic pathogen S. marcescens to outgrow other commensal bacteria.In conclusion we have discovered a contributory role for the gut microbiota in promoting fungal killing of mosquitoes.

Furthermore fungal in- fection causes dysbiosis of mosquito gut microbiota with a significant increase in gut bacterial load and a significant decrease in bacterial diversity.

Moran University of Texas at Austin Austin TX and approved May 4 2017 received for review March 2 2017The insect gut microbiota plays crucial roles in modulating the interactions between the host and intestinal pathogens.

For example the gut commensal microbiota promotes viral infection directly by activating the immunosuppressive cytokine or indirectly by stimulating the proliferation of target cells 35-37.Bacterial overproliferation is limited by the delicate balancebetween the commensal gut microbiota and the immune system of the mosquito host.

After topical fungal infection mosquitoes with gut microbiota die significantly faster than mosquitoes without microbiota.
