Overall our results sug- gested that although pH N 5.0 aw N 0.94 and shelf-life N 5 days of all semi-hard tested cheeses do satisfy the regulated criteria offor growth of L. monocytogenes  however on Edam and Gouda the pathogen do not managed to grow during storage at 7 degC.Effect of initial indigenous microbiota on L. monocytogenes growthThe impact of varying initial levels either of starter culture or in- digenous spoilage microbiota on pathogen growth was evaluated by purchasing commercial packages of cheeses on different dates in rela- tion to production and expiration date namely close to the production date approximately at the middle of their shelf-life and close to the ex- piration date.represents the effect of varying TVC population referred as batches on L. monocytogenes growth in Mascarpone cream on Camembert and Mozzarella soft and on Halloumi semi-hard cheeses during storage at 7 degC.

Three major clusters of cheeses the- oretically representing different classes of risk were identified based on the levels of L. monocytogenes during storage and after exposure to SGFi cheeses showing high survival and  presence of L. monocytogenes after 120 min in SGF combined with high logarithmic increase of the pathogen during storage ii cheeses showing low survival and high  presence after 120 min in SGF combined with low logarithmic increase of L. monocytogenes during storage and iii cheeses with low survival and low  presence after 120 min in SGF combined with low logarithmic increase of L. monocytogenes during storage.

Thus considering the variability of types and levels of intrinsic parameters on cheeses which makes the re- sponse of the pathogen also variable there is a need to expand the existing predictive models for L. monocytogenes growth on the surface of cheeses and especially on semi-hard cheeses to account for the im- pact of additional intrinsic factors such as food structure-related de- terminants and competition with background microbiota that influence the behaviour of the organism.Simulated gastric fluid experimentsThe enumeration results on Cottage Mastelor and Gouda support- ed survival of L. monocytogenes during storage at 7 degC highlighted that surviving populations of the pathogen and its  ratio of positive samples after enrichment with non-quantifiable L. monocytogenes have not been significantly p  0.05 affected by storage time beginning middle or end of storage after which gastric challenge took place I I and I.

On Anthotyros and Manouri the in- creased acidity during storage at 7 degC was manifested as a significant drop of pH from 6.72 - 0.01 to 4.84 - 0.00 p b 0.05 and from5.71 - 0.07 to 5.11 - 0.33 p b 0.05 respectively due to LAB growth likely inhibited L. monocytogenes growth  a and c. Thus although the initial pH and aw values indicated that both cheeses satisfy the requirements of for supporting growth of L. monocytogenes the relative fast decrease of pH to levels close to 4.8-5.1  along with the high competition probably inhibited growth of the pathogen.

Contrary to Mascarpone the low initial pH of Cottage 5.03 - 0.00 was possibly the major restricting factor for L. monocytogenes growth since both cheeses showed similarities in the low initial levels of indigenous microbiota p  0.05 and the significant reduction of aw p b 0.05 during storage  b c d. However previous studies have reported growth of L. monocytogenes maximum 2.0-3.0 log CFUg in Cottage during storage at 7 degC coming in agreement with the  according to which Cottage may support the growth of L. monocytogenes based on its aw and pH  .

2-fold lower  moisture compared to Cottage  potentially protected pathogen during storage andor permitted a persistent survival of L. monocytogenes dur- ing subsequent acid challenge .Regarding Mascarpone Camembert and Halloumi supported growth of L. monocytogenes during storage at 7 degC the enumeration and enrichment results showed that the survivors and  positive sam- ples after enrichment respectively were significantly increased p b 0.05 with storage somehow following the pattern of increased acid resistance during transition from early exponential middle of stor- age to early stationary phase of growth end of storage II II and II.

The objectives of the present study were to assess i the survival or growth potential of L. monocytogenes on various cheeses dur- ing storage ii the effect of initial indigenous microbiota on pathogen growth in comparison to expected growth curves retrieved by existing predictive models and iii the impact of habituation onin cheeses surfaces on the subsequent acid resistance during simulated gastric digestion.

monocytogenes to survive gastrointestinal simulation are limited .Considering the above the objectives of the present study were i to assess the ability of various cheese types for potential growth or survival of L. monocytogenes during storage ii to evaluate the effect of initial in- digenous microbiota on pathogen growth in comparison to expected growth curves retrieved by existing predictive models and iii to exam- ine the impact of habituation onin cheeses on the subsequent acid re- sistance during simulated gastric digestion.Materials and methodsL.

Thus taking into account the above clustering Mascarpone Camembert and Halloumi were characterized as cheeses of high risk red cluster when exposure toSGF for 120 min carried out close to the middle and the end of storage Mascarpone and Camembert or throughout storage Halloumi since they showed increased survival and  presence combined with high growth of L. monocytogenes during storage.
