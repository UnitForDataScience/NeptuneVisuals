In addition the concentration of short-chain fatty acids SCFAs detected in the isoflavone-containing faecal cultures was higher in those inoculated with faecal slurries from equol-producing women.Conclusions This study constitutes the first step in the development of a faecal culturing system with isoflavones that would further allow the selection and isolation of intestinal bacterial types able to metabolize these compounds and produce equol in vitro.

In agreement with the present results isofla- vones have further been described to stimulate in vivo majority microorganisms of the Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV to the latter of which F. prausnitzii belongs  On the other hand like other polyphenols isoflavones mayhave antimicrobial activity which could modulate the diversity and composition of the faecal bacterial communi- ties In this work addition of isoflavones to the faecal cultures drove to a decrease of some taxa.

Although this the presence in the supplement of other minor components apart from isoflavones excipients that might influence the faecal bacterial communities cannot be completely ruled out.Production of SCFAs relevant gut bacterial metabolites was determined in the batch faecal cultures in relation with the addition of isoflavones and the production of equol.

by supplying suitable equol-producing probiotic bacteria.In this study anaerobic batch cultures of faecal samples from equol producer and non-producer menopausal women as determined by urine equol excretion of1000 nM under treatment with soy isoflavones were performed using media with and without isoflavones to examine which bacteria take benefit from soy isoflavones and could be involved in equol production.

In this work we developed an in vitro anaerobic culture model based on faecal slurries to assess the impact of isoflavone supplementation on the overall intestinal bacterial composition changes and associated metabolic transformations.Results In the faecal anaerobic batch cultures of this study bioconversion of isoflavones into equol was possible suggesting the presence of viable equol-producing bacterial taxa within the faeces of menopausal women with an equol producer phenotype.

At the genus-level between 52 and 75 different genera were identified within each faecal culture.Table 2 Short chain fatty acid SCFA production mean - standard deviation in faecal culturesmMCB modified medium for colonic bacteria mMCBISO modified medium for colonic bacteria supplemented with isoflavones Key of statistical significance mMCB compared to mMCBISO p  0.05Among the dominant genera Bacteroides presented the highest percentage with a relative abundance between 10 and 20 of assigned reads Faecalibacterium ranged between 5 and 10 and sequences related to the Clostrid- ium sensu stricto group also reached these percentages 5-10 but only in the primary cultures from the equol non-producing woman Fig.

The metabolism of isoflavones involves several steps me- diated by enzymes provided by different bacterial taxa Even though scientific information is accumulat- ing on the microorganisms producing equol their en- zymes and the metabolic routes involved our current knowledge is still limited Most of the equol- producing bacteria characterized so far belong to the family Coriobacteriaceae However it is not yet clear whether this family is the only intestinal group acting on isoflavones and producing equol.Previously the metabolism of daidzein by faecal bacterial consortia has been microbiologically characterized by con- ventional culturing methods - The availability of high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques opens new potentials to tracking changes in the bacterial communitiesduring isoflavone supplementation in both in vitro and in vivo systems.

Epidemiological studies suggest high intakes of isoflavones to be associated with fewer and less intense menopause symptoms and a reduced inci- dence of hormone-dependent and aging-associated dis- eases such as osteoporosis cardiovascular diseases and cancer Although there is a growing body of scientific evidence showing beneficial effects in counteracting symptoms such as hot flushes and vasomotor reactions in menopausal women the European Food Safety Authority EFSA has recently refuted health claims about the role of isoflavones in body functions This may be so because the functionality of isoflavones depends on their bioavailability and their conversion into more active metabolites within the intestinal tract.

Simi- lar levels of equol production to those obtained with this control strain were recorded in the primary faecal cultures for women with an equol producer phenotype as deter- mined previously by equol urinary excretion  - but not in the faecal cultures from a non-equol producer.

It should be noted that with the UHPLC methodology used in this study other daidzein-derived metabolites that could be formed in the faecal cultures such as hydroxydadidzein DHD and O-desmethylango- lensin O-DMA might have passed undetected.In our study the bacterial composition of the faecal primary and secondary cultures was characterized by two culture-independent methods.
