The escape of microbial factors from the gut can result from perturbations in the gut microbiota and its interaction with immune system components that weakens the mucosal and epithelial lining of the gut.

A dietary fiber-deprived gut microbiota degrades the colonic mucus barrier and enhances pathogen susceptibility.

The absence of gut microbiota leads to functional alterations in immune and intes- tinal epithelial cells which express less microbe sensing toll-like receptors TLR  and major histocompatibility complex II molecules for antigen presentation .Certain aspects of an underdeveloped less responsive gut immune system seem to have beneficial effects in obesity.

These observations suggest that hepatocyte TLR5 plays a role in protecting the liver and in preventing diet-induced liver disease.DYSReGULATiOn OF GUT MUCOSAL SURFACeS CAn COnTRiBUTe TO SYSTeMiC MiCROBiAL eFFeCTSChanges in the gut microbiota can modulate systemic microbe- derived metabolite levels by affecting their biosynthesis or by changing the intestinal permeability and gut barrier.

Changes in gut microbiota control inflammation in obese mice through a mechanism involving GLP-2-driven improvement of gut permeability.

As modulators of the immune response the microbiota-derived signals influence func- tions of distant organs and can change susceptibility to metabolic diseases.Keywords gut microbiota immune system toll-like receptors short chain fatty acids mucosal barrier metabolism dysbiosisMiCROBiOTA SHAPeS THe iMMUne SYSTeM AnD THe HOST MeTABOLiSMThe human microbiota comprises an enormous amount and variety of microorganisms.

Consequently peripheral anti- or proinflammatory responses take place and modulate host metabolism empha- sizing to which substantial extent microbiota can influence systemic health.In addition to the above discussed mechanisms bile acids which can be modified by microbiota or result from microbiota changes could modulate host metabolism   and also have immunomodulatory effects .
