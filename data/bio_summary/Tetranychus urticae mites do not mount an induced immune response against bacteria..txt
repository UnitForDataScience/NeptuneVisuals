importantly this difference is hardly attributable to any of the four most commonly described endosymbionts of spider mites  which are absent from our tested populations electronic supplementary material figure s5.together these results concur in that most bacteria found in these species are inside the mite gut and that betweenurticae and s. berlesei their numbers differ by roughly three orders of magnitude.discussionspider mites are susceptible to bacterial infectionsusing bacteria that are non-pathogenic to d. melanogaster we have shown that spider mites infected over a 100-fold concen- tration range with both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria display high mortality when compared with controls both mock-infected and infected with heat-killed bacteria.

as pre- viously reported  within the same time frame and bacteria inoculum range as our experiment with t. urticae the survival of d. melanogaster was not reduced upon infection with either bacterium cox model bacterial concentration effect x2 14 3501 p 14 0.7439 electronic supplementary material figure s1.the transcriptomic profile of tetranychus urticaeis unaltered upon infectionnext we analysed genome-wide gene-expression patterns to assess the effect of bacterial infection on spider mites using a qpcr-validated microarray set-up differential transcript levels were determined in mites injected with e. coli or withb.

a reduction in survival was observed upon bacterial injection with either bacterial species at all tested concentrations e. coli od 0.1 z 14 3.513 p  0.0022 e. coli od 1 z 14 3.446 p 14 0.0022e.

indeedin t. urticae the number of cfus increased across time points fa whereas for d. melanogaster the number of cfus started to decrease 2 -3 days after injection reaching in the last time point a value similar to the bacterial number initially injected t20 14 20.201 p 14 0.8427. by contrast no significant differences were found between the dynamics of bacteria infecting s. berlesei and d. melanogaster anova f120 14 0.51 p 14 0.482 b between time points anova f420 14 2.287 p 14 0.0957 and in the interaction between time points and species anova f420 14 0.069 p 14 0.9906.this experiment provides a further line of evidence thats.

p  0.05 p  0.01 and p  0.001.however when survival of s. berlesei and t. urticae is con- trasted it is unequivocal that the grain mite is far more capable of surviving infection than the spider mite compare a with a and b with b. finally the same experiment using heat-killed bacteria did not show a differential survi- val of the two mite species electronic supplementary material figure s3.

taken together these observations suggest that to a great extent the immune response in most insects is directly comparable to that of the dipteran drosophila.in chelicerates however the imd pathway seems to be incomplete in all species thus far analysed notwithstanding in carcinoscorpius rotundicauda an orthologue of the drosophila nf-kb-like transcription factors relish has been described and implicated in the immune response against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection .

two general hypotheses may explain this observation i the spider mite mounts an immune response based on a different genetic basis as do other chelicerates or ii as in aphids t. urticae does not possess an inducible anti-bacterial immune response.to distinguish between these hypotheses we present experimental data describing the response of mites to bac- terial systemic infection including host survival bacterial proliferation in the host and transcriptional responses.

we quantified bacteria in individuals that were i surface-sterilized in bleach and alco- hol which should not have bacteria in their external surfaceii fed on rifampicin which should not have bacteria in the gut or iii both which should have neither and iv mites taken directly from their natural substrate which should present both internally and externally associated bacteria.
