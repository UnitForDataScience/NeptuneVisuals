Hazard ratios revealed no significant change in survival between mites injected with LB or with B. megaterium at OD 0.1 z 14 1.769 p 14 0.0769 but sur- vival of T. urticae decreased significantly relative to the LB control at OD 1 and OD 10 B. megaterium OD 1 z 14 8.792p  0.0001 B. megaterium OD 10 z 14 8.797 p  0.0001 c.The high mortality rate in T. urticae caused by infection with bacteria known to be non-pathogenic to Drosophila mela- nogaster  raised the possibility that our bacterial strains had an unexpected level of pathogenicity.

A pairwise comparison of the hazard ratios between spider mites injected with E. coli or with Luria broth LB confir- med that spider mite survival was severely affected OD 0.1 z 14 9.828 p  0.0001 OD 1 z 14 11.124 p  0.0001 and OD 10 z 14 14.267 p  0.0001 c.Injecting spider mites with B. megaterium at three different concentrations ODs 0.1 1 or 10 also significantly affected survival Cox model bacterial concentration effect x2 14 19471 p  0.0006 b.

A reduction in survival was observed upon bacterial injection with either bacterial species at all tested concentrations E. coli OD 0.1 z 14 3.513 p  0.0022 E. coli OD 1 z 14 3.446 p 14 0.0022E.

Taken together these observations suggest that to a great extent the immune response in most insects is directly comparable to that of the dipteran Drosophila.In chelicerates however the Imd pathway seems to be incomplete in all species thus far analysed Notwithstanding in Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda an orthologue of the Drosophila NF-kB-like transcription factors Relish has been described and implicated in the immune response against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection .

Importantly this difference is hardly attributable to any of the four most commonly described endosymbionts of spider mites  which are absent from our tested populations electronic supplementary material figure S5.Together these results concur in that most bacteria found in these species are inside the mite gut and that betweenurticae and S. berlesei their numbers differ by roughly three orders of magnitude.DiscussionSpider mites are susceptible to bacterial infectionsUsing bacteria that are non-pathogenic to D. melanogaster we have shown that spider mites infected over a 100-fold concen- tration range with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria display high mortality when compared with controls both mock-infected and infected with heat-killed bacteria.

Two general hypotheses may explain this observation i the spider mite mounts an immune response based on a different genetic basis as do other chelicerates or ii as in aphids T. urticae does not possess an inducible anti-bacterial immune response.To distinguish between these hypotheses we present experimental data describing the response of mites to bac- terial systemic infection including host survival bacterial proliferation in the host and transcriptional responses.
