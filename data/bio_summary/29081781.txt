In yet another example the fusion peptide MG2A which was synthesized by conjugating MGN-II to the NH2-terminal of the cell-penetrating peptide penetratin Antp exhibited augmented cytotoxicity against a variety of human cancer cells and rat glioma cells while having very limited off-target effects on normal cells .MinOR THeRAPeUTiC CLASSeS OF AMPsStructurally LTX-302 is a 9-mer peptide derived from its parental peptide LfcinB and features an a-helical secondary structure optimized to exert greater antitumor activity -.

Considering that these in vitro malignant phenotypic traits correlate with a pri- mary tumor's propensity to establish life-threatening metastatic outgrowths the finding that defensins are effective at repressing cancer cell motility suggests that they can be developed as poten- tial antimetastatic agents .Furthermore natural defensins appear to exert antiprolifera- tive and proapoptotic effects on cancer cells and to induce cell cycle arrest  - which are evidenced by increases in the levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein suppressed activities of transcriptional and cell cycle cyclin-dependent kinases and their catalytic cyclin partners  and enhanced expression of caspase 7 and 9 and other markers of apoptosis.

Studies have demonstrated that the treatment of a range of human cancer cell lines with temporin-1CEa rapidly induces tumor cell death by disrupting their cell membrane and mitochondria  .

Novexatin NP-213 a cyclic and highly cationic peptide based on humana- and b-defensins has shown promise in treating recalcitrant fungal infections in toenails while CZEN-002 a dimeric peptide sequentially derived from a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is targeting vaginal candidiasis .Antimicrobial peptides are only beginning to encroach into the oncological sphere and therefore efficacy data are relatively limited .

Discovery of a 9-mer cationic peptide LTX-315 as a potential first in class oncolytic peptide.

As an ionophoric peptide with a helical struc- ture it has been shown to perforate cancer cell membranes to act as ion channels causing cytolysis of cancerous cells .

Intriguingly as has also been demonstrated in aforementioned AMPs GGN6 derivatives potently induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in multidrug-resistant cancer cells suggesting its potential to bedeployed in the treatment of refractory malignancies .Polybia-MPI is a cationic peptide extracted from the social wasp Polybia paulista.

Antitumor activity of the antimicrobial peptide magainin II against bladder cancer cell lines.

Apoptosis-inducing activity of the antimicrobial peptide cecropin of Musca domestica in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402 and the possible mechanism.

FK-16 derived from the anticancer peptide LL-37 induces caspase-independent apoptosis and autophagic cell death in colon cancer cells.
