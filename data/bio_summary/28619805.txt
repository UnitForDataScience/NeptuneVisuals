salivarius ATCC 27945a Jahna T. A. Soomer-Jamesa Michel Frenetteb aDepartment of Biology Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago Illinois USAa Departement de Biochimie Microbiologie et Bio-informatique Faculte des Sciences et de Genie Universite Laval Quebec Quebec CanadabABSTRACT Streptococcus salivarius strains are significant contributors to the human oral microbiome.

We present here the complete ge- nomes of Streptococcus salivarius Lancefield K K strains ATCC 25975 and ATCC 27945 which can and cannot respectively produce fimbriae.treptococcus salivarius is a well-known commensal in the human oral microbiome.

Here we present the complete circular genomes of two S. salivarius strains ATCC 25975 originally deposited as S. salivarius Andrewes and Horder and ATCC 27945originally deposited as S. hominis which are Lancefield K and K respectively.Pure cultures of the two strains were provided by American Type Culture Collection ATCC.

PROKARYOTESComplete Genome Sequences of Two Human Oral Microbiome Commensals Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 andS.

Certain S. salivarius strains are classified as Lancefield K because they lack the K antigen .

Streptococcus salivarius strains carry either fibrils or fimbriae on the cell surface.

Streptococcus salivarius fimbriae are composed of a glycoprotein containing a repeated motif assembled into a filamentous nondissociable structure.

The csp operon ofStreptococcus salivarius encodes two predicted cell-surface proteins one of which CspB is associated with the fimbriae.

Coaggregation of Streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens evidence for involvement of fim- briae in the interaction with Prevotella intermedia.
