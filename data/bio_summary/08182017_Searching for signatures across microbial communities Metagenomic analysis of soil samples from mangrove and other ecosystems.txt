Following quality trim- ming a total of 54833910 85.13 of the total remained including for 7809729 reads for PGD average read length of 408 - 138 bp 7303470 reads for MAL average read length of 408 - 138 bp 6414174 reads for VL1 average read length of 200 - 68 bp and 5920270 reads for PYN average read length of 193 - 64 bp.

The classes within Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla have similar diversity and percentage of reads assigned to their top classes across all of the Kerala samples.A majority of the reads assigned to Archaea 1.32 - 0.44 of total reads mapped to the phylum Euryarchaeota 81.77 - 7.02 across all four samples Fig.

A total ofGB 64 million reads were obtained across all four of the Kerala mangrove samples and 54 million reads 85.13 were retained for further analysis following quality control.

Collectively bacterial sequences dom- inated the overall reads accounting for 96.81 of the total assigned reads with Eukaryota and Archaea assigned 1.8 and 1.32 respectively.

The reads that mapped to each genus were calculated and only those genera with more than 1 of the total mapped reads were noted Fig.

3 of the ocean reads mapped to Archaea and more than 95 of the arboreal reads both mangrove and rain forest are bacterial.

Reads that mapped to these particular classes were not even found or barely registered in any of the ocean samples which instead had Thermococci and Methanococci as the most prevalent classes among the ocean reads that mapped to the Euryarchaeota phyla.Less than 2 of the total reads from any sample mapped to Eukaryota.

The forest samples had similar profiles the exception being Protein Metabolism where the India mangrove sample PGD had many fewer reads Supplementary Table 2 and the ocean sample with a clear majority of mapping reads.

Summary of reads and distribution across kingdoms in the samples from India Brazil Puerto Rico and from the isolates taken from the South China Sea.Except for absorption of nutrients transformation processes of nutrients can also be important for avoiding eutrophication.The impact that mangrove forests and their supporting ecosystem extends beyond their local ecological impact.

Taxonomic structure and diversity of the reads mapping to Bacteria.
