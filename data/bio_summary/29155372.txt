Patients with GI disorders have higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population and patients with anxiety and depression experience more GI symptoms than healthy people.learning From Microbe-Free MiceMajor scientific interest in the microbiome-gut-brain axis was sparked by a 2004 study of germ-free GF mice.

Fecal microbiota transplantation is being tested as a method to manipulate or modulate the gut microbiome in a way that may relieve diseases like depression associated with abnormalities in the microbial community of the gut.In a study by Cryan and colleagues a fecal microbiota trans- plantation from depressed human patients to GF rats resulted in behavioral and physiological symptoms of depression in theNovemberDecember 2017 V ieee pulse 17animals.

Researchers are finding that microbes seem to play a role not only in intestinal health but also in psychiatric health including an individual's proclivity to depression.

Elevated blood levels of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with depression and their levels are par- tially regulated by gut microbiota.The bidirectional nature of gut-brain communication is illus- trated by the high degree of overlap between GI and psychiatric disorders.

We submitted it a million times.stress Bacteria and DepressionDespite initial skepticism research has continued to demon- strate a link between gut bacteria the brain and depression.

The baby mice with normal gut microbes that ex- perienced early life stress exhibited signs of depression and anxiety and they pro- duced more of the stress hormone cor- ticosterone.

Within several weeks the mice started showing signs of anxiety and depression.

Mayer thinks that the bacteria in the yogurtis not only gut bacteria but also changes in the microbiome-gut- brain axis that lead to depression in animals subjected to early life stress.

Cryan and his colleagues found that the administration of either of these two bacteria was as effective as the antidepressant Lexapro in treating depression symp- toms in mice.Yet despite compelling animal evidence there is little re- search on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in humans.
