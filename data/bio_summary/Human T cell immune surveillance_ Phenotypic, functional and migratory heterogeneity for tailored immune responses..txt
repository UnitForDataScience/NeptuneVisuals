Novel technologies and computational developments that allow an in-depth dissection of T cell heterogeneity on the single-cell level such as time of flight mass cytometry CyTOF and single-cell transcriptomics are expected to unravel even more T cell specializations fates developmental programs and functional states that translate into precisely tailored immune responses .Together the diversification of human T helper cell subsets and the co-regulation of their migration properties exemplify the division of labour of human immune surveillance on the effector T cell level.

In addition the mismatch of T cell phenotypes in peripheral tissues and blood suggests distinct T cell identities in the tissues that are sequestered from recirculation.Over the past several years the existence of a novel T cell popula-tion has been established the tissue-resident memory T cells TRM .

This review highlights and discusses re- cent developments in human T cell immune surveillance with a particular focus on functional and migratory T cell heterogeneity and provides a critical framework for new conceptual ideas which could serve as a starting point in the quest for novel targeted therapies for chronic tissue restricted inflammatory diseases.Dissecting human immunity - challenge and chanceT cells have critical roles in the defence against a great variety of pathogens as well as in the tolerance of autoantigens and of the com- mensal microbiota.

T cell receptor signal strength and duration costimulation and cytokines represent the classic signals for the instruction of divergent T cell dif- ferentiation .

The identifi- cation of Th17 cells as a distinct T helper cell subset has shaken this dichotomous view on the division of labour between T cells and has heralded the discovery of a so far unappreciated heterogeneity of T cell identities and fates.

GM-CSF producing T cells have been detected in highly increased frequencies in the cere- brospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis which suggests an association of this T cell functionality with multiple sclerosis and pos- sibly also with other autoimmune diseases .Likewise several other T cell differentiation programs have been demonstrated which translate into specialized functions and migratory preferences i.e.

The absence of T cell recirculation via the blood as assessed byparabiosis experiments in which the blood circulation of two mice is conjoined is compelling evidence for T cell maintenance in the tissues .

It remains unresolved how tissue residency is transcriptionally regulated in the CD4 T cell compartment as Hobit and Blimp-1 are not expressed in the T helper cell lineage except for in rare cases that go along with cytotoxic functionalities .Naive T cells recirculate between blood and secondary lymphoid tissues which they enter through high endothelial venules .

Whether this constitutes a peripheral maintenance mechanism of the naive T cell pool after thymic involution or serves another physiological purpose remains to be elucidated.Implications for human health and diseaseThe last few years have witnessed a very successful translation of growing insights into the heterogeneity of human T cell subsets into therapeutic strategies.
