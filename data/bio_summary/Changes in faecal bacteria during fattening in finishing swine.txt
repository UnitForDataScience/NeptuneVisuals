The ratio of propionic acid and butyric acid to total SCFA were stable from 0 to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment and significantly decreased at 14 weeks P  0.05.Plasma leptin and PUN concentrationsPlasma leptin concentration significantly increased until 10 weeks P  0.05 and then stabilized until the end of the experi- ment A. PUN concentration increased until 8 weeks of growth P  0.05 and then remained unchanged from week 8e14 B.Quantification of firmicutes bacteroidetes and bacteroidesThe changes in the number of Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides in porcine faeces were monitored.

The levels of Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides significantly correlated with feed intake body weight plasma leptin concentration or PUN concentration P  0.001.

demonstrated SCFAs areTable 4Correlation between the levels of Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides and body weight plasma leptin and plasma urea nitrogen PUN concentration.activators of GPR 41 and SCFAs stimulate leptin production in cultured adipocyte and whole animal of mice through the GPR41.

All calculations were made using a commercially available computer program .ResultsFeed intake and body weightFeed intake was increased P  0.05 from start of the experi- ment until 8 weeks and then it was significantly decreased P  0.05 until the end of the experiment .

The level of Firmicutes increased P  0.05 whereas those of Bacteroides and Bacteroidetes decreased P  0.05 with fattening.

Similarly the levels of Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides in faeces correlated with body weight in pigs and humans but there was no correlation between the level of Firmi- cutes and body weight .Gut microbiota convert undigested carbohydrates into SCFAs and the SCFAs produced by fermentation are absorbed in the large intestine and utilized as an energy source by host animals .

In swine leptin sup- pressed feed intake  and leptin mRNA expression increased with age and body weight gain as shown in mouse.

Furthermore the levels of Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides correlated with body weight and the correlation coefficient in Bacteroides was higher than that in Bacteroidetes.

Plasma leptin concentrations were found to be significantly correlated with the levels of Bacteroidetes and Bacter- oidetes and the levels of gut microbes might be related to body fat accumulation.

The levels of Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides correlated with feed intake body weight and plasma leptin or plasma urea nitrogen PUN concentration.
