The high-dose B. adolescentis CCFM 626 CCFM 667 and CCFM 669 and L. plantarum ST-III groups and the low-dose B. adolescentis CCFM 626 CCFM 667 and CCFM 669 and L. plantarum ST-III groups received 0.25 mL of 4 x 1010 CFUmL or 4 x 108 CFUmL bacterial suspension respectively in the same manner as the treatment groups for 14 days and the positive drug control group was treated with a 70 mgkg body weight dose of phenolphthalein once per day for 14 days.

adolescentis could alleviate constipation and that inter-strain differences exist in the alleviation of constipation induced by loperamide in BALBc mice.Based on this background the aims of this study were 1 to determine whether B. adolescentis shows inter-strain differences in the alleviation of constipation induced by loperamide in mice 2 to analyze the main reasons for the inter-strain differences such as the basic biological characteristics of the strains the concentration changes of short-chain fatty acids SCFAs in feces and the changes in the fecal flora and 3 to determine the changes in other indicators of constipation including some parameters of the enteric nervous system including motilin MTL gastrin Gas substance P SP endothelin ET somatostatin SS and vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP.ResultsGrowth Characteristics of B. adolescentis In VitroThe growth curve of each strain of B. adolescentis cultured under anaerobic conditions at 37 C in cMRS broth was drawn to determine the growth characteristics of B. adolescentis in vitro.

These results revealed that B. adolescentis CCFM 667 relieves constipation by improving the colonic transit time and that B. adolescentis CCFM 669 relieves constipation by promoting small intestinal peristalsis.

The water content of defecation in the B. adolescentis CCFM 626 group was similar to that in the control group which indicates that B. adolescentis CCFM 626 has no effect on constipation.

These results revealed that B. adolescentis CCFM 669 CCFM 667 and CCFM 626 exerted strain-specific effects on relieving constipation.

The small intestinal transit rates in the high-dose B. adolescentis CCFM 669 and CCFM 667 groups were the highest that in the phenolphthalein group was the second and that in the high-dose B. adolescentis CCFM 626 group was the lowest.

All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego CA USA and OriginPro8.5 OriginLab Corporation Northampton MA USA.ConclusionsIn conclusion by measuring related constipation indicators stool status water content of defecation GI transit rate and time to the first black stool defecation it was found that B. adolescentis CCFM 669 and 667 could alleviate constipation.

Thus CCFM 667 and 669 could relieve constipation whereas CCFM 626 could not.
