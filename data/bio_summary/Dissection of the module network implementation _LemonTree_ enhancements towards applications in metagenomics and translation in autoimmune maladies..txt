the two steps gene clustering and regulators assignment are computed independently.module network algorithms have been implemented in a variety of software packages such as genomica5 lemone learning module networks and merlin.6-12 among them lemone has been under development for several years and its most recent version ''lemontree'' used in this analysis has been greatly improved in terms of user friendliness and integration of the pipeline written in pure java no longer dependent on perl and matlab to process intermediate results.6 the major distinctive characteristic of lemontree is the extensive usage of the ''ensemble approach'' - a machine learning strategy that combines multiple models to obtain better performances than single model approaches and allows flexibility in the final structure.13 the ensemble approach is used both in the gene clustering and in the regulator assignment step where a stochastic sampling technique confines the regulator list to the most likely ones.to perform our tests we first exploit the synthetic data software syntren14 for the analysis of the solutions' accuracy using metrics including sensitivity specificity and false discovery rate vital to practical applications of the software under different parameter settings and data quality.

the candidate regulator list consists of 2060 mirnas and mrnasannotated to functions go0007165 signal transducer activity and go0003677 dna binding.7 we subsampled this list to derive four candidate regulator lists at different lengths defined by the parameter reg  10 50 100 500. for more details see table 1.synthetic data for performance evaluationto warrant objective evaluations of the performance syntren was used to generate a series of 200-gene expression datasets.14 syntren subsamples two networks from the yeast regulatory gene network the foreground network consisting of true yeast regulators and their regulated genes and the background network using false candidate regulators.16 to simulate interactions corre- lations were imposed between genes across different treatments conditions in the foreground but not in the background.

2 rows from top to bottom larger sample size is generally associated with better auc in spite of a few exceptions nreplicate  10 bn  0.5 is lower than nreplicate  2 possibly resulting from the instability of the regulators assignment algorithm as we observed before.in this context it is worthwhile warning the users of the peculiar meaning of the ''random regulator list'' output by lemontree alongside the ''assigned regulator list'' for each module.

in the process we uncovered and fixed an issue in the code for the regulator assignment procedure.

leaves and nodes are computed in two steps the gene clustering step and the regulator assignment step.

we then deepen this analysis with quantification of the solutions' stability on a real cancer dataset15 and implement a correction to the original code which overcomes an issue compromising the regulator assignment task when candidate regulators have opposite expressions between a partition of experiments samples.the emerging guidelines are applied in a novel inferential setting the changes in the composition of the gut intestinal gi microbiome in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis ra.materials and methodsreal data for performance evaluationthe real data contain paired mrna and mirna expression profiles from 89 cancer samples.15 we preprocessed the mrna expression data to be zero centered with standard deviation sd  1 for each gene and we filtered low dispersion sd o 0.5 following lemontree specifics 3826 mrnas were removed.

given the small number of true regulators 17 we kept the candidate regulator list unvaried to avoid loss of information due to random subsampling.

regulator performances are assessed by varying the input parameters reg nreg and perc.

it is noteworthy that the real data benchmark complements the synthetic data for the accessibility to multiple modules and candidate lists and is more adapted to the char- acterization of regulator stability.at the end of these three testing subsections we present motivation and results for lemontree software correction.
