We then deepen this analysis with quantification of the solutions' stability on a real cancer dataset15 and implement a correction to the original code which overcomes an issue compromising the regulator assignment task when candidate regulators have opposite expressions between a partition of experiments samples.The emerging guidelines are applied in a novel inferential setting the changes in the composition of the gut intestinal GI microbiome in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis RA.Materials and methodsReal data for performance evaluationThe real data contain paired mRNA and miRNA expression profiles from 89 cancer samples.15 We preprocessed the mRNA expression data to be zero centered with standard deviation SD  1 for each gene and we filtered low dispersion SD o 0.5 following LemonTree specifics 3826 mRNAs were removed.

The two steps gene clustering and regulators assignment are computed independently.Module network algorithms have been implemented in a variety of software packages such as Genomica5 LeMoNe Learning Module Networks and MERLIN.6-12 Among them LeMoNe has been under development for several years and its most recent version ''LemonTree'' used in this analysis has been greatly improved in terms of user friendliness and integration of the pipeline written in pure Java no longer dependent on Perl and Matlab to process intermediate results.6 The major distinctive characteristic of LemonTree is the extensive usage of the ''ensemble approach'' - a machine learning strategy that combines multiple models to obtain better performances than single model approaches and allows flexibility in the final structure.13 The ensemble approach is used both in the gene clustering and in the regulator assignment step where a stochastic sampling technique confines the regulator list to the most likely ones.To perform our tests we first exploit the synthetic data software SynTReN14 for the analysis of the solutions' accuracy using metrics including sensitivity specificity and false discovery rate vital to practical applications of the software under different parameter settings and data quality.

For definitions of input parameters and output variables see Methods.Regarding modules we assessed the stability using the number of tight clusters NTC by varying the input parameter nc.For regulators we evaluated the accuracy with an array of metrics including true positive rate TPR sensitivity false positive rate FPR 1-specificity false discovery rate FDR and the corresponding receiver operating characteristic ROC curves and areas under the curve AUC y-axis TPR x-axis FPR orFDR as well as the stability with the average overlapping ofResults and discussionBenchmarking results are organized in the first three subsec- tions the first concerns module stability affected by nc mea- sured with NTC using real data the second characterizes the performances reported using AUC on the regulator output for variations of the input parameters nreg and perc with synthetic data as biological noise - bn - and sample size - nreplicate -regulators AOR defined as 1N1i jNIRi  RjIjRij where Rcan be tuned.

It is noteworthy that the real data benchmark complements the synthetic data for the accessibility to multiple modules and candidate lists and is more adapted to the char- acterization of regulator stability.At the end of these three testing subsections we present motivation and results for LemonTree software correction.

In particular in our real- world GI-microbiome data application we tested and verified the impact of perc on regulator assignment stability.

As per our synthetic data analysis perc should be set atleast to 30 in order to achieve a decent TPR 40.6.We hypothesized that high FDRs could be overcome by a stringent perc.

S3-2 and that strikingly Roseburia appears as a constant top regulator in every instantiation thus clearly identifying a highly probable regulator that would survive more stringent perc 10-20 ESI Data S3 and Table S3-4.ConclusionsIn this study we surveyed the parameter landscape of a freely available module network implementation - LemonTree.

In comparison for datasets with a modest sample size and little noise nreplicate  10-50 bn r 0.2 FDR is no longer an issue even when perc  100 the full ''assigned regulator list'' for examplewhen nreplicate  10 bn r 0.2 we recommend perc  20 for a TPR E 0.6 and FDR o 0.2 a good balance between sensitivity and FDR.

Therefore LemonTree's default perc  1 showing the most extreme variability should be revised in light of these results.We also observe that at a fixed perc stability tends to decrease as the candidate regulator list gets longer e.g.

We hence carefully assessed for LemonTree - a popular and open source module network implementation - the dependency of the software performances sensitivity specificity false discovery rate solutions' stability on the input parameters and on the data quality sample size expression noise based on synthetic and real data.
