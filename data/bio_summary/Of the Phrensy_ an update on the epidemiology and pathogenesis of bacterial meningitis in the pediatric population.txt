Recent studies of the human microbiome have illustrated dynamic relationships of bacterial and viral populations with the host which may potentiate the risk of bacterial meningitis.IntroductionAt the turn of the 20th century bacterial meningitis was an almost universally fatal disease.

We review some of these models and provide an update on the role of the microbiome in the development of meningitis.Overview of the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in childhoodTraditional descriptions of bacterial meningitis in childhood have stratified causative pathogens on the basis of age as there is a stark contrast in the bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis in newborns compared with older children.

Despite the distinc- tions in pathogens between the age cohorts pathogens of pediatric bacterial meningitis can also cause disease in young infants and vice versa.Pediatric bacterial meningitisFor over 30 years the Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion CDC in the US has published surveillance data of bacterial meningitis.

Serogroup A accounts for 80-85 of all outbreak cases and many global efforts in distributing vaccines to epidemic regions of Africa have significantly reduced the incidence of meningitis.Young infant bacterial meningitisIn older studies Streptococcus agalactiae Group B Streptococcus or GBS was the most frequently identified pathogen from cases of young infant bacterial meningitis followed in incidence by other organisms including Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes.

The release of bacterial products causes direct toxicity to neurons and stimulation of the immune response which contributes to additional neurotoxicity.Interactions with the host are not limited to the bacterial domain as co-inhabitation of specific viruses with bacteria led to synergis- tic relationships.

In a longitudinal study of healthy twins the neonatal bacterial microbiome gained bacterial diversity with increased age and conversely bacteriophage diver- sity decreased with age.

This may suggest an essential relation- ship between bacteriophages and development of the gut bacterial microbiome in which the bacteriophage population guides the diversity of the bacterial population.

Further data are needed to determine whether the risk of invasive bacterial disease is increased by certain compositions of the microbiome and whether bacteri- ophage populations potentiate this risk.The relatively immature immune system of the neonate also contributes to the invasive risk of bacterial pathogens.

Though significant these immune defects are transient likely contributing to the decreased inci- dence of serious bacterial infections with increasing age.ConclusionsThe incidence of bacterial meningitis in children has been dramatically reduced and this is primarily because of immunization and intrapartum prophylaxis strategies.
