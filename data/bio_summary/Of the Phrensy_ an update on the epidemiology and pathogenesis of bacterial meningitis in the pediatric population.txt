early onset disease is caused predominantly by bacteria transmitted at the time of parturition whereas late-onset disease is caused by members of the micro- biome transmitted at birth or through exposures after birth such as maternal contact or method of feeding.

despite the distinc- tions in pathogens between the age cohorts pathogens of pediatric bacterial meningitis can also cause disease in young infants and vice versa.pediatric bacterial meningitisfor over 30 years the centers for disease control and preven- tion cdc in the us has published surveillance data of bacterial meningitis.

recent studies of the human microbiome have illustrated dynamic relationships of bacterial and viral populations with the host which may potentiate the risk of bacterial meningitis.introductionat the turn of the 20th century bacterial meningitis was an almost universally fatal disease.

in general infections that occur within the first 7 days of life of a term neonate are described as early onset dis- ease whereas infections occurring from 7 to 60 days after birth are described as late-onset disease.

in 2000 a seven-valent pneumococcal vaccine pcv7 targeting asubset of serotypes associated with invasive disease was licensed in the us.
