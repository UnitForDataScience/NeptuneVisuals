Interestingly most of them belong to the phylum Actinobacteria 17 species followed by g-Proteobacteria 9 species and Firmicutes 5 species.

Lipid-accumulative species and species with additional compound accumulation together constitute be- tween 8 Fig.

Hot desert species are assumed to accumulate larger amounts of lipids per gram cell dry weight than humid soil species.

An explicit comparison of these species and their ex- tent of lipid accumulation with non-extremophilic bacteria may be helpful.If especially hot desert species produce a high cellular lipid content focusing on these habitats will save time and moneyFig.

However species from salt-rich locations may possibly be much easier to cultivate than species from desert locations.In summary new applicable strains must show not only efficient lipid accumulation but also suitability for large- scale cultivation.

Comparison of corre- sponding literature resulted in several bacterial species from desert habitats which had already been described as lipid- accumulative elsewhere.

With more than 50 of the total com- munity size in single studies hot deserts appear to be more favorable for lipid-accumulative species then humid soil 20 and cold deserts 17.
