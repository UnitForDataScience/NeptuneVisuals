All animal protocols conform to national animal care committee guidelines with IACUC approval UF IACUC Approval 102004234 July 2016.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSerp-1 Structure and Crystallographic Arrangement.The structure of Serp-1 was determined in a C2 space group unit cell dimensions of a  99.01 A b  122.1 A c  130.1 A and b  94.9deg to a high resolution of 2.5 A and Rcryst and Rfree values of 20.6 and 25.7 respectively .

Our goal was to design peptides that would increase the number of interactions with human serpins and improve the antiplaque activity of the peptides in comparison to the number in the original peptide.12 calculated free energy changes associated with single-point mutants to S-7 15 amino acids in RCL peptides of Serp-1 and sought to implement the following criteria in modified peptide design 1 implementing residue substitutions toward the C-terminus facing toward the protein surface of the peptide to minimize potential loss of binding interactions due to steric hindrance of residue side chains in the protein core and 2 increasing the potential for hydrogen bonding interactions in regions that are conserved or semiconserved between each of the human serpins.
