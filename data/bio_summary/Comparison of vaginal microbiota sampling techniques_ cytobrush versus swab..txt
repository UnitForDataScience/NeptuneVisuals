A comparison of swabs and cytobrushes used for vaginal microbiota sampling and subsequent analysis by sequencing has not previously been conducted.ResultsThirty premenopausal non-pregnant women with histologically-proven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions HSIL were recruited in the colposcopy clinic between July 2014 and April 2015.

We therefore hypothesised that cytobrushes would be associated with higher diversity due to these different properties.In this study we compared the results obtained using swabs and cytobrushes from a population of 30 women with HSIL to determine whether these two techniques provide a comparable overview of the structure of the vaginal microbiota.

dominant vaginal microbiota on swab sampling were subsequently found to have a high-diversity CST IV on cytobrush sampling.the cytobrush-collected samples may contain a high load of host DNA which can be problematic however this was not assessed in the current study.Overall our study demonstrated that swab and cytobrush samples provide comparable VM results at all tax- onomic levels as demonstrated by two-groupsample correlation coefficients hierarchical clustering analysis and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index.

Given the wide surface of the cervix and the amount of discharge found in women it is unlikely that the gentle tip of the swab would be sufficient to disturb the microbiota in the cytobrush hence the reason for such a study design.This report is the first study to compare the VM in women sampled using swabs or cervical cytobrushes.

Sobs Species observed.for the purpose of sequencing bacterial DNA to study the human vaginal microbiota in a variety of patient cohorts the most common being swabs but the use of cytobrushes as well as cervicovaginal lavage epithe- lial scrapes and biopsieshas also been reported.

Further larger studies are required to confirm the findings of this study.In conclusion analysis of our data shows that rayon swabs and polyethylene cervical cytobrushes produce comparable results when comparing the vaginal microbiota composition at species level and did not show any significant difference in diversity or richness.

We have also demonstrated the higher biomass collected by cytobrushes in a separate cohort of 20 further women in whom the mean weight of sample collected by swabs was 50 milligrams mg compared to 1560 mg by cytobrushes unpublished data which supports that cytobrushes collect a much higher biomass than swabs.

We chose women with high-grade pre-invasive disease as opposed to low-grade or normal controls or a mixture since our previous study which included women with various disease severity and healthy controls indicated that women with HSIL should have good representation of major vaginal CSTs.
