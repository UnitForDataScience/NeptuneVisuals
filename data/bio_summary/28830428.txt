iron deficiency and anaemia are also com- mon complications in cd and their prevalence ranges from 12 to 69 of newly diagnosed patients lower bone mass density was determined in 74 of adult cd sufferers who stuck to a gfd for long periods of time  taking into consideration the abovementioned research results it could be sug- gest that gfd alone may not effectively reverse the clinical symptoms and re-establish intestinal micro- biota balance in cd patients even if gfd is still con- sidered the most rational treatment approach.

our findings could also have important implications for nutrition and supplementation guide- lines for children with cd as well as protocols for nutri- tional management of cd which aim to alleviate the harmful effects of the disease.additional fileabbreviationsalt alanine aminotransferase anova one-way analysis of varianceast aspartate aminotransferase bmi body mass index cd coeliac disease consort consolidated standards of reporting trials crp c-reactive protein edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay espghan european society for paediatric gastroenterology hepatologyand nutrition ffq frequently consumed foods questionnaire gc-fid gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detector gc-ms gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector gfd gluten-free diet hplc-dad high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector iga immunoglobulin a il-1a interleukin 1a itf inulin-type fructans lsd least significant difference pcr polymerase chain reaction pdai pouchitis disease activity index scfa short chain fatty acids sd standarddeviation sds standard deviation scores tnf-a tumour necrosis factora ttg anti-tissue transglutaminaseacknowledgementswe are grateful to lidia maria wadolowska and ewa niedzwiedzka for help with description of food frequency questionnaire.fundingthe research was supported by the statutory funds of the department of chemistry and biodynamics of food in the institute of animal reproduction and food research pas and by preludium project 201621nnz901510 of the national science centre poland.availability of data and materialsnot applicable.authors' contributionsukk conceived the study.

in a follow-up full-size multicentre study a larger population will be investigated and differentiated accord- ing to age duration of gfd andor other parameters.despite these limitations the results of this study could contribute to the development of novel nutritional strategies for cd patients.

the par- ticipants were recruited for the study between novem- ber 2015 and january 2016. a total of 96 cd patients were invited to participate in the pilot trial during regu- lar visits at the clinic or by way of an invitation letter de- scribing the details of the planned trial.

the duodenal microbiota composition of adult celiac disease patients is associated with the clinical manifestation of the disease.

many cd patients who observe a strict gfd continue to experience symp- toms of the disease.

in 20-80 of patients following a gfd the mucosal lesions marsh ii and iii were reportedsimilar to intestinal epithelia impairment that is noted in newly diagnosed patients.

this study is reported according to the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in nutritional epidemiology strobe-nut checklist participant selectionchildren and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years diagnosed with cd based on the criteria developed by the european society for paediatric gastroenterology hepa- tology and nutrition espghan  were recruited from among the patients of the department of paediat- rics gastroenterology and nutrition of the children's hospital in olsztyn at least 6 months before the study.

the results obtained in the pilot study will be used to calculate the sample size for a fully-powered study that will be carried out in the future on paediatric cd patients receiving oligofructose- enriched inulin with gfd.statistical analysisanthropometric and demographic data will be analysed using descriptive statistical methods.

research indicates that rigorous observance of gfd alleviates gastrointestinal symptoms and restores gut health in cd patients  however compliance with gfd guidelines varies consider- ably from 80 to less than 40 .

detailed information relating to the measured anthropometric parameters is presented in table diet controlin line with strobe-nut recommendation in the present study a modified ffq-6 was applied it is a semi-qualitative food intake frequency questionnaire commonly used as a retrospective dietary assessment method suitable to evaluate the relation betweentable 2 the participants' baseline anthropometric datatotal sampleintervention group placebo group n341816aaverageconsumed food and disease the applied ffq-6 was a modified version from the original ffq-6 available online that was developed and validated using a re- liability testing method in the population of young women aging form 13-21 years old from olsztyn poland.

to fill this research gap a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to assess the influence of the oligofructose-enriched inulin on paediatric cd patients following a gfd.based on the literature data it could be hypothesized that the inclusion of prebiotics in gfd could be an easy to administer and cost-effective alternative treatment for cd.

the main aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of an oligofructose-enriched inu- lin synergy 1 on selected biochemical parameters and nu- tritional status of paediatric cd patients following a gfd.
