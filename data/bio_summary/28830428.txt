Iron deficiency and anaemia are also com- mon complications in CD and their prevalence ranges from 12 to 69 of newly diagnosed patients Lower bone mass density was determined in 74 of adult CD sufferers who stuck to a GFD for long periods of time  Taking into consideration the abovementioned research results it could be sug- gest that GFD alone may not effectively reverse the clinical symptoms and re-establish intestinal micro- biota balance in CD patients even if GFD is still con- sidered the most rational treatment approach.

Our findings could also have important implications for nutrition and supplementation guide- lines for children with CD as well as protocols for nutri- tional management of CD which aim to alleviate the harmful effects of the disease.Additional fileAbbreviationsALT Alanine aminotransferase ANOVA One-way analysis of varianceAST Aspartate aminotransferase BMI Body mass index CD Coeliac disease CONSORT Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials CRP C-reactive protein EDTA Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ELISA Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ESPGHAN European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatologyand Nutrition FFQ Frequently consumed foods questionnaire GC-FID Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detector GC-MS Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector GFD Gluten-free diet HPLC-DAD High performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector IgA Immunoglobulin A IL-1a Interleukin 1a ITF Inulin-type fructans LSD Least Significant Difference PCR Polymerase chain reaction PDAI Pouchitis disease activity index SCFA Short chain fatty acids SD Standarddeviation SDS Standard deviation scores TNF-a Tumour necrosis factora tTG Anti-tissue transglutaminaseAcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Lidia Maria Wadolowska and Ewa Niedzwiedzka for help with description of food frequency questionnaire.FundingThe research was supported by the statutory funds of the Department of Chemistry and Biodynamics of Food in the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research PAS and by PRELUDIUM project 201621NNZ901510 of the National Science Centre Poland.Availability of data and materialsNot applicable.Authors' contributionsUKK conceived the study.

To fill this research gap a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to assess the influence of the oligofructose-enriched inulin on paediatric CD patients following a GFD.Based on the literature data it could be hypothesized that the inclusion of prebiotics in GFD could be an easy to administer and cost-effective alternative treatment for CD.

In addition to the inflammation of the small in- testine CD can also be manifested by other symptoms affecting different organs or tissues  .

Untreated CD could lead to chronic inflammation malabsorption and nutritional defi- ciencies.

A strict lifelong gluten-free diet GFD which re- quires complete abstinence from foods and grains that contain gluten wheat rye barley is regarded as the only proven and accepted therapy for CD.

Research indicates that rigorous observance of GFD alleviates gastrointestinal symptoms and restores gut health in CD patients  however compliance with GFD guidelines varies consider- ably from 80 to less than 40 .

Many CD patients who observe a strict GFD continue to experience symp- toms of the disease.

In microbiological stud- ies - the diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifido- bacterium bacteria was reduced in CD patients which is associated with intestinal dysbiosis.
