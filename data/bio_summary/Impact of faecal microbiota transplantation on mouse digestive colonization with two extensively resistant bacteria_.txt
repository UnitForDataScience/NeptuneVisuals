EveillardAccepted 22 April 2017a 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Infection Association.QFT has proved more specific than the Tuberculin-Skin test TST for detecting tuberculosis TB in countries where TB incidence is low1 its use in pediatric tuberculosis TB is limited by the lower sensitivity of the test in immunocom- petent children younger than 5 years old and in HIV- infected children.2In this journal we recently reported the potential added value of combining IFN-gamma IP-10 and IL-13 releases for diagnosing latent TB in 0e5 years old immunocompetent children.3 Here we further explored the potential added value of these biomarkers in HIV-infected children.

Actually the growing incidence of extensively drug-resistant XDR bacteria such as carbapenemase- producing Enterobacteriaceae CPE and vancomycin- resistant Enterococci VRE is considered as a global threat.Faecal microbiota transplantation FMT has been widely used in recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and proved that FMT can effectively eradicate a specific pathogen from digestive tract.Successful digestive decol- onization has been recently reported for two patient cases a patient colonized with a CPE OXA-48-producing Entero- bacteriaceaeand a patient colonized with an ESBL.In the present study we aimed comparing the effec- tiveness of FMT for decreasing the load of digestive colonization with two XDR bacteria a CPE isolate and a VRE isolate by using a mouse model.Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Commit- tee in Animal Experimentation of Pays-de-la-Loire France reference 2015041415088410APAFIS 513 and conducted according to European directives concerning the use of animals in research 86609EEC.Eighty 8-week old mice Swiss type were used for the model.

Also TB status was similar in the two groups ongoing active TB before anti-TB treat- ment n Z 412 and 312 untreated latent TB or past active TB n Z 812 and 912 children in HIVthTBth and HIV-TB- respectively.Lower M.tb-specific QFT value was observed in HIVthTBth children median 0.63 IUml than among HIV-TBth children median 9.42 IUml p Z 0.007.

They were seeded on agar media after serial dilutions for VRE Brilliance VRE Oxoid UK and CPE Chrom ID CARBA bioMerieux France screening and for describing commensal bacterial flora by using chromogenic media UTI Oxoid horse blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid CNA bioMerieux.

In our study FMT has been associated with a significant but transient reduction of VRE and CPE faecal carriage in a mouse model of digestive colonization with a significantly greater effect on VRE.

The study was conducted in Ile-de-France France a low TB burden area where the sensitivity of QFT to diagnose active TB is impaired in HIV-infected children Hormi et al.

Mice were then randomized to receive a high inoculum 5.109 bacte- ria of a strain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus fae- cium VRE or a strain of Escherichia coli producing a New Delhi metallo-b-lactamase-1 NDM-1 CPE.

Stools were screened for the presence of VRE and CPE and were microbiologically charac- terized as described thereafter.
