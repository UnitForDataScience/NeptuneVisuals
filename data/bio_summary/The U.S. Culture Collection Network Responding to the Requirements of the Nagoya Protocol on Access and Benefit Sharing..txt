Historical biodiversity collections and research resource collections often have very simple accession and transfer re- quirements while formal government collections often have more-formal MTA agree- ments .

Many of these approaches depend on access to validated microorganisms from public culture collections   many of which began as personal research collections or as the result of systematic collecting mutagenesis manipulation or taxonomic descrip- tion.

Importantly Brazil has taken the position that access to all genetic resources from Brazil begins not when they were collected exported and deposited in collections but when the research and development activities access take place.

The Member States are responsible for considering inclusion and verification of these collections however the requirements and responsibilities of such a status have limited the number of culture collections engaging in this process.

The American Phytopathological Society has been a leader in issues related to living microbe collections  and also provides administrative support to the USCCN.The World Federation for Culture Collections WFCC has served as a venue for interaction among culture collections for nearly 70 years.

Many U.S. research resource collections hold genetically characterized model organism strains with various histories such as strains that were isolated in the early classical genetic era genetically crossed mutagenized and modified by various molecular genetic techniques .Additional U.S. collections described at the February 2017 USCCN meeting included a freshwater alga collection UTEX Culture Collection of Algae  a cave microbe collection University of Akron  and a biodiversity collection of yeasts Phaff Yeast Culture Collection University of California Davis .

Of these collections the FGSC is primarily a research resource repository serving a specific research community by holding and managing classical genetic and gene deletion mutant strains in addition to nearly 5000 wild-type strains isolated in nature around the world.While classical and targeted genetic mutants are primarily research tools their impor- tance was recently reemphasized by the inability to recapitulate phenotypes seen in zebra fish gene suppression lines using mutant lines generated with molecular tools such as CRISPR-Cas .Among the biodiversity collections described at the meeting the collection of cave microbes held at the University of Akron has special provenance.

Other collections represented at the meeting include the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA Agriculture Research Service ARS Culture Collection Peoria IL the USDA ARS security back-up collection Fort Collins CO which holds more than 111000 microbial isolates from 20 different U.S. culture collections the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center Bloomington IN the USDA Forest Service's Center for Forest Mycology Research collection Madison WI and The Mollicutes Collection of Cultures and Antisera Gainesville FL.EXISTING PRACTICESTo allow comparison and establish precedent participants at the February 2017 meeting shared their accession and distribution practices.

The fact that most living collections can distribute materials while keeping the original distinguishes them from other types of collections.
