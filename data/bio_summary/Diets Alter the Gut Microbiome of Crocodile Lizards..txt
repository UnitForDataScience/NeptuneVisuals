This study aimed to describe for the first time the wild state of the crocodile lizard gut microbiota as well as potential alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota of crocodile lizards with different diseases and diets compared with that in wild and healthy control subjects.The composition of the gut microbiota in crocodile lizards is unique.

However there is no sufficient evidence that the gut microbiota contributes to either disease A or disease B.This study provides an overview of the gut microbiota of the crocodile lizard an extremely endangered lizard at different states as well as the first examination of the relationship between disease and the gut microbiota in lizards.

These results provide a reference for the conservation of endangered crocodile lizards and the first insight into the relationship between disease and the gut microbiota in lizards.Keywords wild and captive lizards disease diet gut microbiota Shinisaurus crocodilurusINTRODUCTIONThe crocodile lizard Shinisaurus crocodilurus Ahl 1930 is the only species in the monotypic genus Shinisaurus and the monotypic family Shinisauridae.

The gut microbiota of loach- fed crocodile lizard was significantly different from the gut microbiota of the wild and the earthworm-fed crocodile lizards.

In the gut microbiota of other lizards the abundance of Fusobacterium if any was very low similar to that of the wild group of crocodile lizards         .The loach-based diet resulted in the significant predominance of Elizabethkingia Halomonas Morganella and Salmonella in the crocodile lizard gut microbiota.

The high content of potential pathogenic bacteria in loach-fed group suggests that the diet of loach not only altered the structure of gut microbiota but also increased the risk of infection for crocodile lizards.CONCLUSIONThe composition of the crocodile lizard gut microbiota is unique compared with other animals.

Is the gut microbiota associated with disease susceptibility in crocodile lizards How does cultivation shape the gut microbiome of crocodile lizards To explore these questions and to facilitate the protection of this endangered species we analyzed the amplicon-based microbiome of cloacal swab samples from crocodile lizards using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

We compared the gut microbiota of sick healthy captive and wild lizards to identify the interactions among specific diseases diets and the gut microbiota in crocodile lizards.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample CollectionAll samples were collected from Guangdong LuokengS.

However captivity had no effect on the community diversity of gut microbiota of crocodile lizards according to the Shannon index.The effect of captivity in shaping of gut microbiota was also reflected in the enrichment of specific microbes.

Here we examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and diet and disease by comparing the fecal microbiota of wild lizards with those of sick and healthy lizards in captivity.
