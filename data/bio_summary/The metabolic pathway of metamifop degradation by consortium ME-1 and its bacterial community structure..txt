the comprehensive degradation capability of microbial consortium me-1 shows superiority to previous reported studies in which consortium w1 merely had the ability of fe and metamifop degradation dong et al.

the consortium designated as me-1 with stable metamifop-degrading ability was obtained.growth and degradation curvethe cells from consortium me-1 precultured in msm supplemented with 100 mg l-1 metamifop were harvested by centrifugation allegra x-22r cen- trifuge f0630 rotor beckman coulter usa at 31409g for 5 min then washed twice with sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7.5 and resus- pended in sterilized msm to obtain an optical density od600 of 1.0 1.0 9 108 cells ml-1.

these results demonstrated that consortium me-1 will be a potential candidate for bioremediation of aopp herbicide contaminated soil.metabolites identificationto explore the degradation pathway of metamifop by consortium me-1 the intermediate metabolites were collected and identified by hplc-ms as shown in fig.

and the biodegradation pathway of the metamifop by consortium me-1 was consistent with one of the four pathways.bacterial community analysissince the behavior of bacteria influenced pollutants degradation further research by high throughputsequencing was conducted to analyze the bacterial community diversities and phylogenetic structures of consortium me-1.

the optimal ph for degradation of metamifop was between 7.0 and 8.0. the degradation ability decreased at initial ph values at and above 10.0 or below 6.0 and consortium me-1 did not show degradation ability at initial ph value below 4.0 fig.

.degradation of other aopp by consortium me-1fe cp qe and cb are members of the aopp herbicide family so their degradation by microbial consortium me-1 was examined with the concentra- tion of 100 mg l-1 in msm.

the consortium me-1 was able to transform all of the four aopp withtable 1 the degradation of various aopps by consortium me-1cyhalofop-butyl7 - 244 - 7.85 - 8quizalofop-p-ethyl1 - 114 - 463 - 4clodinafop-propargyl5 - 136 - 440 - 10fenoxaprop-p-ethyl7 - 333 - 676 - 9transformation percentages of 76 - 8 40 - 1063 - 4 and 85 - 8 after 120 h for fe cp qe and cb respectively table .

in addition 50 genera were classified in consortium me-1 of which methylobacillus sphingobacterium bordetella and flavobacterium were the dominant genera with sequence percentages of 25.79 25.61 14.68 and9.55 respectively.keywords metamifop  consortium me-1  metabolic pathway  community structure  aryloxyphenoxy propionate herbicideintroductionmetamifop r-2-4-6-chloro-13-benzoxazol-2-yloxy phenoxy-20-fluoro-n -methyl-propionanilide a syn- thetic pesticide belonging to post-emergent aryloxyphe- noxy propionate herbicide aopp is broadly used100-150 g active ingredient ha-1 for controlling a wide range of annual and perennial grass weeds in cereal crops and rice fields whitacre and ware .

d nmfa treated with consortium me-1 for 6 daysconcentration was observed in the control without inoculation of consortium me-1.

a the degradation efficiencies of 100 mg l-1 metamifop after 6 days of incubation increased from 18 to 91 when the inoculum size was raised from 1 to 10. the results indicated that the degradation efficiencies of metam- ifop were positively correlated with the consortium me-1 inoculum size.

degradation of metamifop and its metabolites was qualitatively evaluated by ultraviolet scanning.microbial community analysisdna extraction and pcr amplificationthe consortium me-1 was harvested from msm containing 100 mg l-1 metamifop with degradation efficiency above 80 by centrifugation at 31409g for 5 min.

d.in order to further confirm metabolites during metamifop degradation the abilities of consortium me-1 for cdhb hpp and nmfa degradation were determined by uv scanning.

phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbor-joining method and evaluated by bootstrap analyses based on 1000 re- samplings.results and discussiondegradation of metamifop by consortium me-1the microbial consortium me-1 with the capability of metamifop-degradation was isolated using continuous enrichment method.

all degradation experiments consisted of three replicates.metabolites identificationthe consortium me-1 as described above was inoc- ulated into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml msm supplemented with 100 mg l-1 metamifop.
