The comprehensive degradation capability of microbial consortium ME-1 shows superiority to previous reported studies in which consortium W1 merely had the ability of FE and metamifop degradation Dong et al.

The consortium designated as ME-1 with stable metamifop-degrading ability was obtained.Growth and degradation curveThe cells from consortium ME-1 precultured in MSM supplemented with 100 mg L-1 metamifop were harvested by centrifugation Allegra X-22R Cen- trifuge F0630 rotor Beckman Coulter USA at 31409g for 5 min then washed twice with sterilized phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.5 and resus- pended in sterilized MSM to obtain an optical density OD600 of 1.0 1.0 9 108 cells mL-1.

The consortium ME-1 was able to transform all of the four AOPP withTable 1 The degradation of various AOPPs by consortium ME-1Cyhalofop-butyl7 - 244 - 7.85 - 8Quizalofop-p-ethyl1 - 114 - 463 - 4Clodinafop-propargyl5 - 136 - 440 - 10Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl7 - 333 - 676 - 9transformation percentages of 76 - 8 40 - 1063 - 4 and 85 - 8 after 120 h for FE CP QE and CB respectively Table .

The scale bar indicates 0.05 substitution per nucleotide positionTable 3 The blast results of dominant OTUs of consortium ME-1a The ''T'' after strain names represented type strainIn the present study nearly all sequences over 99.99 were assigned to bacteria and the bacterial community of consortium ME-1 at the phylum level was accordingly illustrated in Fig.

These results demonstrated that consortium ME-1 will be a potential candidate for bioremediation of AOPP herbicide contaminated soil.Metabolites identificationTo explore the degradation pathway of metamifop by consortium ME-1 the intermediate metabolites were collected and identified by HPLC-MS as shown in Fig.

And the biodegradation pathway of the metamifop by consortium ME-1 was consistent with one of the four pathways.Bacterial community analysisSince the behavior of bacteria influenced pollutants degradation further research by high throughputsequencing was conducted to analyze the bacterial community diversities and phylogenetic structures of consortium ME-1.

The degradation ability decreased at initial pH values at and above 10.0 or below 6.0 and consortium ME-1 did not show degradation ability at initial pH value below 4.0 Fig.

.Degradation of other AOPP by consortium ME-1FE CP QE and CB are members of the AOPP herbicide family so their degradation by microbial consortium ME-1 was examined with the concentra- tion of 100 mg L-1 in MSM.

d NMFA treated with consortium ME-1 for 6 daysconcentration was observed in the control without inoculation of consortium ME-1.

d.In order to further confirm metabolites during metamifop degradation the abilities of consortium ME-1 for CDHB HPP and NMFA degradation were determined by UV scanning.
