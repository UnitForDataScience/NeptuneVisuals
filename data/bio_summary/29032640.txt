It varies from 0 to 1 and the index increases as the diversity decreases 23.When we compare Shannon-Weaver or Simpson diversity indices between samples with different number of sequences normalization of the number of sequences in all samples is important before examining microbial community diversity because these diversity index values increase as the number of sample size increases hence normalization is crucial to avoid biases in the results 21.RarefactionWhen microbiota are collected from a certain niche there is a need to evaluate how well a sample reflects the true diversity of the specific niche which is synonymous with species richness and relative abundance in time and space 14.

Even though there is no general agreement on which diversity index is the best to use diversity indices have been used to compare the diversity among samples and between treatments with controls.

Shannon-Weaver and Simpson diversity indices have been traditionally used to measure the diversity of communities 15.Shannon-Weaver and Simpson diversity indices provide more inference about the community composition than simple species richness or evenness Table 1.

However the uses of Shannon-Weaver andSimpson diversity indices have been recommended to robustly measure microbial diversity 20.

In this review important questions concerning microbial diversity are addressed.Shannon-Weaver and Simpson Diversity IndicesA definition of biodiversity is widely cited as follows Biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from the ecological complexes of which organisms are part and it is defined as species richness and relative species abundance in space and time 14.

A species diversity index denotes a mathematical measure of species diversity in a community.
