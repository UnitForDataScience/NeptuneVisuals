2.Physiological VariablesTreatment x time interactions were detected P  0.04 for plasma concentrations of TNFa haptoglobin cortisol insulin leptin and serum NEFA and a ten- dency P  0.09 for such interaction was detected for plasma cholecystokinin concentrations.Steers receiving LPS had greater P  0.01 plas- ma TNFa concentration at 2 h and greater P  0.05 plasma haptoglobin concentrations from 24 to 72 h relative to treatment administration compared with CON steers Fig.

Average concentrations of plasma insulin prior to treatment application was also a significant covari- ate P  0.02 within its analysis and tended P  0.06 to be greater in LPS steers than in CON steers Table 1.

Accordingly treatment x hour interactions were detected P  0.02 for DM and NDF disappearance as percent remaining of initial DM and NDF content given that these variables were less P  0.01 in LPS steers than in CON steers from 4 to 12 h relative totreatment administration Fig.

Steers receiving LPS also had greater P  0.01 plasma insulin and glucose concentration at 2 h but reduced P  0.05 plasma glucose concentrations from 4 to 12 h rela- tive to treatment administration compared with CON steers Fig.
