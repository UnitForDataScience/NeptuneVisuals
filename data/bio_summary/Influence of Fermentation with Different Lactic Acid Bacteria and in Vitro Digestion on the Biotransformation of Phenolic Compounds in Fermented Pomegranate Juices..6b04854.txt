in other studies with apples and blackberries phenolic compounds such as flavonoids lignans and phenolic acids were stable to the gastric conditions.however in other studies with dried figs and pomegranate extracts a slight decrease in such compounds was observed.it has to be pointed out that none of the previous studies was performed with fermented food matrices.metabolism and biotransformation of phenolic compounds in fermented pomegranate juices during and after intestinal digestion.

therefore the lab used in this study can transform the phenolic compounds present in pomegranate juices suggesting a possible prebiotic effect of phenolic compounds.microbial metabolites derived from the fermentation of pomegranate juices and the high viability of microorganisms reaching the colon may contribute to the maintenance of gut health.

further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of action of phenolic microbial metabolites in humans.associated contents supporting informationthe supporting information is available free of charge on the at doi .representative hplc chromatograms of fermented pomegranate juices and fermented pomegranate juices after gastrointestinal in vitro digestion author informationcorresponding authorm.j.f.

therefore the health effects are not the same for everyone.in recent years pomegranate juice has been investigated due to its beneficial properties because of its elevated concentration of polyphenols.those polyphenols include mainly anthocya- nins procyanidins phenolic acids flavonol glycosides and hydrolyzable tannins such as ellagitannins gallotannins and punicalagins.however humans cannot absorb those hydro- lyzable tannins and therefore these compounds are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid which is also poorly absorbed being metabolized in the colon by the microbiota to produce urolithins.the urolithins together with other phenolic metabolites are mainly responsible for the health properties.the capacity of lactic acid bacteria lab to metabolize the phenolic compounds depends on the species or on the strain.the microbial conversion of polyphenols can occur during a foodfermentation process by lab.- those bacteria are the main source of probiotics which are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host.

although health beneficial effects due to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium have been shown their function as antioxidants has not been fully investigated.the aim of this study was to investigate the biotransforma- tion of the phenolic compounds in pomegranate juices a after fermentation by four lab and b during in vitro digestion of unfermented and fermented juices.

the antioxidant properties and lab survival were also investigated in different fermented pomegranate juices to study the influence of fermentation and in vitro digestion on the polyphenol biotransformations.materials and methodsactivated bacterial strains and culture preparations.

the cultures were separated by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min at 4 degc washed twice with sterile phosphate buffer saline pbs and stored with glycerol at -80 degc until used.fermented pomegranate juices.

pomegranate juices in aseptic bags of 4.5 kg were provided by probelte biotecnologia s.l.

according to the supplier's certificate of analysis the pomegranate juice had 14.9 of soluble solids content ph 3.7 and an acidity of 0.31 g citric acid100 ml as well as compliance with the microbiological criteria specified total plate count yeast and mold salmonella sp.
