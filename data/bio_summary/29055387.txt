Determination of passive electrical properties of the colon wall is a good candidate for such purpose.1 In relation to ''take care of the colon we believe that we all should become a kind of ''micro-farmers in that we ought to maintain or restore an equilibrated intestinal microbiota.2 In this context and in addition to the afore mentioned Hippocratic aphorism that ''all diseases begin in the gut we also ought to recall assertions like those of Huan Ti the father of Chinese medicine also known as the Yellow Emperor when he states that ''One should criticize and correct the faults in the patient's mode of life one should restore their bodies and open the anus so that the bowels can be cleansed and so that the secretions come at the proper time.. .

The sequence they proposed as a hypothesis on bacterial induced metabolic disease was 1 high fat feeding  2 change in gut flora  3 increased intestinal per- meability  4 increased endotoxemia  5 inflammation  6 metabolic disorders.In our model we add the following aspectsDisruption of the colonic mucus layer between steps 2 and 3Bacterial translocation between steps 4 and 5 simultane- ously with ''increased endotoxemiaExacerbation of the enteric nervous system ENS also known as ''our second brainMaladaptation and abnormal responses of the myenteric tis- sue like the ''occult reflex see section ''Colon maladapta- tion and dysfunction.For CNCDs in general we will then have 1 unhealthy diet rich in fat refined carbohydrates and red meat and low in fiber  low amount or lack of exercise  over emotional stress  and permanent exposition to xenobiotics and all kinds of noxious stim- uli   2 dysbiosis alteration in the ratio of ''harmful and ''beneficial commensal bacteria   3 alteration of the mucus layer  4 disruption of the tight junctions with increased intestinal permeability  5 metabolic endotox- emia  bacterial translocation  6 inflammation also ter- med ''meta-inflammation or ''low grade inflammation 7 Exacerbation of the enteric nervous system ENS and maladaptation and malfunctioning of the colon   8 individ- ual genetic and epigenetic predisposition  9 CNCDs or ''chronopath.

The main idea is that there is a common pathway from wellbeing and health to chronic disease ''chronopathy and even to death which comprises following steps 1 unhealthy diet sedentary life style and permanent exposition to xenobiotics and all kinds of noxious stimuli  2 intestinal dysbiosis  3 alteration of the intestinal mucus layer especially that of the colon  4 dis- ruption of the endothelial tight junctions  5 metabolic endotoxemia  bacterial translocation  6 inflammation  7 exacerbation of the enteric nervous system ENS and consequent maladaptation and malfunctioning of the colon  8 epigenetic manifestations  9 ''chronopathy and premature death.

This division is marked by a clear line from which the inner layer is transformed into the external layer a change mediated by a proteolytic activity dependant on the host The ''loose layer is easily removed while the ''firm layer is not.The internal layer is usually thinner than the outer layer measuring about 116 - 51 mm in the colon of rats while only 15 - 2 mm in the jejunum The external layer is both the habitat and a partial source of energy for the bacteria while the internal layer is devoid of bacteria and in physiologic homeostatic conditions consti- tutes a physical barrier that avoids the invasion of our organ- ism by the microbiota When the ''firm layer becomes permeable to bacteria either by deficiencies in its composition or structure bacteria and different toxins but especially lipopolysaccharides or LPSs come in contact with the epithelial cells and induce a disrup- tion of the tight junctions causing an increase in the intesti- nal permeability This increased permeability allow the further penetration of bacteria and toxins which come in contact to the cells of our immune system and of the enteric nervous system ENS or our ''second brain The mucus layer maintains high concentrations of immunoglobulin A IgA and lysoenzymes acts as a neutral- izer of free radicals and also present some antigens to the immune system Mucus is permanently secreted an effect that is controlled by paracrine hormonal and nervous effects mediated by nitrous oxide NO prostaglandins and other neurotransmit- ters and hormones Its functional effectiveness depends on various factors as its thickness and stability as well as its physical and chemical properties .Increased intestinal permeabilityThe next step in the physiopathology of ''chronopathy is the increase in intestinal permeability due to malfunctioning of the tight junctions.

In the former for instance there is production of cytokines in response to the presence of LPSs of which it is estimated that there can be at least 1 g in the entire gut of an adult human being which presence in the blood stream can be produced by an increased intestinal permeabilityBiochemical bacterial production of abundant potentially encephalotoxic metabolites like D-lactic acid and ammonia as well as short chain fatty acids SCFA especially acetate butyrate and propionate which even if they have many beneficial effects can also play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of disorders like autismNeuroendocrine Bacteria can produce hormones and neu- rotransmitters and also respond to them affecting intestinal motility and afferent excitation to the brain.

This implies not only that we should con- sciously take care of it but also to monitor it permanently.In conjunction with this low risk and low cost interventions to restore an altered colon homeostasis could also be useful.

In the epithelium we find different types of cells with different functions stem cells in charge of the permanent epithelial turnover enterocytes especially abundant in the small intestine and responsible for the digestion and subsequent absorption of nutrients water and electrolytes but which also produce some antimicrobial peptidesmucus secreting Globet cells predominantly in the colon Paneth cells which produce antibacterial peptides and proteinsTuft cells with secretory absorptive and reception functions not yet very well establishedenteroendocrine cells which secrete different types of hor- mones with both systemic and local effects acting in the latter case as local messengers or also acting upon the ENS in order to activate nervous responses.All these cells are kept together by three types of structures or junctions desmosome adherent and tight.

also studied how the development of colon cancer is associated with increased tight junctional permeability.EndotoxemiaThe concept of endotoxemia also known as ''metabolic endo- toxemia consists in a translocation of LPSs with an increase of 2-3 times its blood concentration.

This altered equilibrium has two main characteristics  reduc- tion of the microbiota biodiversity and changes in the proportionsor prevalence of some operational taxonomic units OTUs at dif- ferent levels from harmful increases in phyla firmicutes for instance or genera as Clostridia and Escherichia to decreases in bacteroidetes at phylum level or lactobacilli and bifidobacteria at genera level.Disruption of the intestinal mucus layerAn early consequence of dysbiosis is the disruption of the mucus layer that covers the intestinal wall which in reality is a bilayer the outer luminal layer is the natural habitat of the intestinal microbiota and the inner epithelial layer which acts as a physicochemical barrier to it .

In this perspective we are designing a comprehensive fat reduction pro- gram which is a combination of the orthodox medical non- pharmacological approach as recommended by the WHO and an alternative treatment known as colon therapy or colon hydrotherapy.
