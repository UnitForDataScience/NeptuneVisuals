Here we investigated whether the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 ECN could mod- ulate the outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE a murine model of MS. We evidenced that daily oral treatment with ECN but not with the archetypal K12 E. coli strain MG1655 reduced the severity of EAE induced by immunization with the MOG35-55 peptide.

To investigate the impact of ECN treatment on intestinal barrier function during EAE progression we measured the intestinal permeability of mice treated daily with ECN 7 and 14 days after MOG35-55 immunization.

It is also possible that ECN may reduce microbial imbal- ance in the EAE gut through inter or intraspecies competition for which ECN genome encodes specialized molecules .In conclusion our findings show that alteration of the intes- tinal barrier function is associated with EAE progression and severity.

Interestingly ECN-treated mice exhibited increased numbers of MOG-specific CD4 T cells in the periphery contrasting with severely reduced numbers in the CNS sug- gesting that ECN might affect T cell migration from the periphery to the CNS through a modulation of their activation andor differentiation.

We show that ECN administration has beneficial effects on EAE and this beneficial effect is associated with changes in T cell compartmen- talization cytokines production by autoreactive CD4 T cells and intestinal permeability.aniMals anD MeThODs animalsC57BL6J male mice were obtained from Janvier Labs Le Genest Saint-Isle France and housed under specific pathogen-freeconditions with ad libitum access to food and water.

We further checked whether oral treatment with ECN could modulate the effector function of MOG-specific CD4 T cells.

Intriguingly treatment with ECN significantly increased the production of IL-10 by MOG-specificCD4 T cells  which is a hallmark of Tregs  .

In contrast to the CNS there was an increase in the total number of MOG-specific CD4 T cells in the inguinal cervical and to larger extent mesenteric lymph nodes of mice treated with ECN.

In addition MS patients exhibit defects in regulatory T cells Tregs known to suppress the activity of effec- tor T cells .In recent years the incidence of autoimmune diseases in populations from developed countries has dramatically risen.

coli intestinal loads were equivalent regardless of the type of strain and .encephalitogenic MOg-specific cD4 T cells are Trapped in the Periphery in ecn-Treated animalsPeripheral activation and subsequent migration of autoreactive CD4 T cells into the CNS are critical steps in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS  .
