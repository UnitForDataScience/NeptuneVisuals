additional but often unappre- ciated insight afforded by studies of the oral microbiome developed from 16s microbiomemetagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches include the observation that there is con- siderable variation in the microflora within and between patients including healthy and dis- eased sites  .the role diabetes plays in altering the oral microbiome as it relates to periodontal disease is under continuous study.

these results may not be directly applicable given that our cohort had minimal oral disease and better glycemic control.the oral microbiome in patients with periodontal disease is most often studied by sampling supra- andor subgingival dental plaque.

nevertheless while treatment of periodontal disease may not improve overall glycemic control preventive dental care could have a positive impact on the adverse metabolic consequences of t2d.there has been a recent surge in the characterization of the oral microbiome in health and periodontal disease.

while there is also some evidence that therapies aimed at reducing the inflammatory burden of periodontal disease moderately improve glycemic control  - a recent ran- domized trial in adults using non-surgical periodontal therapy demonstrated no change in hemoglobin a1c hba1c in spite of improvement in periodontal measures .

each subject completed an oral health survey received a clinical oral examination and provided unstimulated saliva for measurement of inflammatory markers and microbiome analysis.resultsthe diabetes group was less likely to have had a dental visit within the last six months.

these observations highlight the importance of a better understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiome and chronic inflammation associated with obesity and t2d.several studies show higher rates of caries and gingivitis in children with type 1 diabetes   yet there is a relative absence of information regarding the oral health status of obesechildren with and without t2d .

this study examines the oral health salivary biomarkers and the oral microbiome of obese children with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance.

more recent molecular method techniques based 16s rrna sequencing which is used to define the oral microbiome have revealed further complexities including the observation that much of the oral flora has yet be cultivated  including bacteria such as filifactor alocis and tm7  .
