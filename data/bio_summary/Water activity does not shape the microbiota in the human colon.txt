The values recorded are consist- ently higher than 0.97 aw .Given the relevance of water activity in the context of food spoilage there is ample availability of data regarding minimal aw values required to allow thegrowth of specific micro-organisms From these reports it is clear that aw above 0.97 provide sufficient unbound water to support the growth of most bacteria.As aw values of fresh faecal samples can be expected not to exceed those in the colon environment our results indicate thatB.

While the impact of passage rate on ecosystem composition has recently been shown to partially account for BSS-associated microbiota variation the potential correlation with water avail- ability remains unexplored.Water activity aw is a dimensionless variable that reflects the availability of water in a system aw pure water1.

Its relevance in a driving force for gut ecosys- tem compositional variation is currently unclear.Here we measure water activity of 62 fresh faecal samples with different consist- encies using a resistive electrolytic hygrometer LabMaster Novasina Lachen Switzerland accuracy 0.003 aw technical variability 0.002 aw which measures relative air humidity through the resistance of an electrolyte at constant temperature 37degC.
