Many microbiome studies including large-scale micro- biome efforts of the National Institutes of Health's Com- mon Fund Human Microbiome Project and MetaHIT have most often focused on bacteria with fewer efforts focused on examining human fungi.Fungi comprise a smaller proportion of human microbial sequences as compared with bacteria but remain an important com- ponent of the human microbiome.Fungi have been studied for well over a century with research ranging from the role of fungi in human diseases to the influence of fungi on bacterial growth and from the interactions between fungi and host immunity to the biologic activi- ties of fungal metabolic products.

A growing body of literature now highlights the bacterial communities in the lung in the healthy host and in individuals with lung disease but as with the gut the fungal composition of the lung is not as well-understood.

The emergence of genomic methods to study fungi has the potential to expand our understanding of the contributions of human fungi to health and disease.

The lung comes into contact with environmental fungi routinely during respiration and oral fungi may be aspirated into the lungs.

Because fungi can trigger both the innate and adaptive immune systems it is hypothesized that fungal dysbiosis may be a component of chronic lung diseases such as asthma cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD.

Despite these difficulties studies of the lung mycobiome in both humans and animal models focusing on the composition and function of the lung mycobiome as well as its effects on the host are critical to advance the field.Fungi are an integral component of the vaginal micro- bial ecosystem in many healthy women with early stud- ies reporting cultivation of fungal isolates from vaginal samples.

This issue of Viru- lence reviews literature on the human mycobiome focusing on distinct body sites.Studies of the bacterial microbiome of the gastrointes- tinal tract have formed the foundation of next-genera- tion sequencing investigations of the human microbiome.

We are only beginning to understand how the mycobiome functions to both maintain health and to cause disease but fungi may be an underappreciated component of many illnesses.Disclosure of potential conflicts of interestNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.FundingSupported by the NCI Intramural Research Program HHK.ORCIDHeidi H.

Far fewer studies have examined the myco- biome of the gut in health and disease or investigated its functional impact on the host.While bacteria outnum- ber fungi in the gut there are a significant number of fungal taxa in the gut and the majority of them can only be detected with non-culture-based techniques.
