Rigorous studies together with curated microbiome data will provide an in-depth understanding of the maternal micro- biomes and their impact on pregnancy and hopefully iden- tify new therapeutic strategies to decrease the incidence and burden of PTB.allergy may arise when the community structure is abnormal.Koren et al.

A standard pipeline for conducting human microbiome research is well-described by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium and in a recent review by Goodrich et al.Here for a clinical perinatology research audience we present the key steps for conducting a high-throughput micro- biome analysis of pregnant subjects including 1 designing the study 2 sampling the subjects 3 extracting the DNA generation 16S amplicons sequencing on a high-throughput platform 4 performing community analysis and reporting findings.

For example Aagaard et al.found that chorioamnionitis is associated with a modified fetal membrane community.
