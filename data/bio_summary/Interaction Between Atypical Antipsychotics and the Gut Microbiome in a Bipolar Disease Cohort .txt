gut species diversity is often cited as a marker of gut health because it is decreased in a number of populations with metabolic syndrome risk factors such as obesity or diabetes.28 rele- vant to our findings rat models of antipsychotic- induced weight gain and microbiome analysis also show a gender bias in which female rats experience greater weight gain and microbiota community differences than do males.14 29 30 although our cohort was underpowered for male patients to investigate gender differences in medi- cation response properly a previous publication looking at microbiome changes in males observedfigure 4. fecal microbiota diversity as measured by inverse simpson diversity index  in aap-treated yes and non- aap treated no patients with bipolar disease.

up to 30 years of life are lost in this population primarily due to cvd.1 for patients receiving an atypical antipsychotic aap the risk of metabolic syndrome is more than twice that seen in the general population.2 at least 40 of those taking an aap meet metabolic syndrome criteria that consist of aconstellation of cardiovascular symptoms that together significantly increase cvd risk.3 in addi- tion a gender bias exists for aap-associated cvd risks as seen by a comparison of clinical antipsy- chotic trial of intervention effectiveness catie participants with matched healthy controls from the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii.4 when investigators exam- ined participants based on the 10-year coronary heart disease risk using the framingham heart study formula significant differences were seen for elevations in cvd risk 50 females vs 34 males5 6 and metabolic syndrome 137 more likely in females 85 more likely in men.7 the mechanisms that lead to greater cvd risk in this population have not been defined.a wealth of data is available pertaining tothe role of the gut microbiota in cvd dia- betes metabolism and systemic inflamma- tion.8 9 without prospective studies it is difficult to determine whether the gut micro- biome predisposes patients to these illnesses or if these illnesses modulate the microbiome.

differences in microbiota diversity between the female medi- cation cohorts remained significant after adjust- ing for age bmi and benzodiazepine treatment p0.02 b-4.6 r20.12.discussionalthough the pathogenesis of aap-associated metabolic disease is undoubtedly multifactorial the contribution of the gut to this phenotype is an avenue worth investigating.

however when examining the rela- tive abundance of otu25 in the nonobese we observed a significant decrease in otu25 in those treated with aaps.a significant decrease in microbiome commu-nity diversity for aap-treated patients was revealed when calculating the inverse simpson diversity index between the medication treat- ment cohorts figure 4a p0.045.

due to reports linking gut bacteria func- tion to metabolic disease we hypothesize that aap treatment in adults results in gut dysbiosis potentiating metabolic criteria.

muciniphila is a mucin degrader in the intesti- nal tract and has a notable inverse association with inflammation insulin resistance altered adi- pose metabolism and atherosclerosis.24-26 data suggest that in response to aaps without increases in bmi both human and animal models incur metabolic phenotypes such as glucose dys- regulation.27 this makes the decreased relative abundance of a. muciniphila in nonobese patients notable.we also observed a significant decrease in spe- cies diversity for the aap-treated cohort acorrelation that was stronger in aap-treated females.

analysis of molecular variance amova was used to detect significant clustering of microbial communities between groups and the inverse simpson diversity index was used to calculate alpha diversity.
