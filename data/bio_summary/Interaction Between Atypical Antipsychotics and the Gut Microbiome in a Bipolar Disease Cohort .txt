Up to 30 years of life are lost in this population primarily due to CVD.1 For patients receiving an atypical antipsychotic AAP the risk of metabolic syndrome is more than twice that seen in the general population.2 At least 40 of those taking an AAP meet metabolic syndrome criteria that consist of aconstellation of cardiovascular symptoms that together significantly increase CVD risk.3 In addi- tion a gender bias exists for AAP-associated CVD risks as seen by a comparison of Clinical Antipsy- chotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness CATIE participants with matched healthy controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES III.4 When investigators exam- ined participants based on the 10-year coronary heart disease risk using the Framingham Heart Study formula significant differences were seen for elevations in CVD risk 50 females vs 34 males5 6 and metabolic syndrome 137 more likely in females 85 more likely in men.7 The mechanisms that lead to greater CVD risk in this population have not been defined.A wealth of data is available pertaining tothe role of the gut microbiota in CVD dia- betes metabolism and systemic inflamma- tion.8 9 Without prospective studies it is difficult to determine whether the gut micro- biome predisposes patients to these illnesses or if these illnesses modulate the microbiome.

Differences in microbiota diversity between the female medi- cation cohorts remained significant after adjust- ing for age BMI and benzodiazepine treatment p0.02 b-4.6 R20.12.DiscussionAlthough the pathogenesis of AAP-associated metabolic disease is undoubtedly multifactorial the contribution of the gut to this phenotype is an avenue worth investigating.

Due to reports linking gut bacteria func- tion to metabolic disease we hypothesize that AAP treatment in adults results in gut dysbiosis potentiating metabolic criteria.

Gut species diversity is often cited as a marker of gut health because it is decreased in a number of populations with metabolic syndrome risk factors such as obesity or diabetes.28 Rele- vant to our findings rat models of antipsychotic- induced weight gain and microbiome analysis also show a gender bias in which female rats experience greater weight gain and microbiota community differences than do males.14 29 30 Although our cohort was underpowered for male patients to investigate gender differences in medi- cation response properly a previous publication looking at microbiome changes in males observedFigure 4.

Differentially abundant OTUs between treatment groups were OTU1 OTU25 and OTU32 that classified to Lachnospiraceae Akkermansia and Sutterella respectively.CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that AAP treatment is associated with specific representation of gut bacterial families in AAP-treated patients.

This report describes recent findings linking AAP treatment with differences in gut microbiota communities in a human cohort with bipolar disorder BD.METHODS In a cross-sectional design we obtained 16S ribosomal sequences from 117 BD patients 49 AAP treated 68 non-AAP treated.

Gastric bypass surgery studies show that aside from sustained weight loss this procedure also precipitates decreased type II diabetes prior to any weight decrease.10 11 Furthermore gastric bypass directly affects glucose regulation and other studies have cited a shift in microbiota composition suggesting that the microbiome may improve metabolic function.12 13In a recent study of 18 human male adoles-cents 9-15 years old chronic use of the AAP risperidone longer than 1 year was associatedThe purpose of this study was to determine if treatment-specific differences in gut microbe communities were detectable in a well-character- ized cohort of patients with a serious mental ill- ness.

In the future obtaining this informa- tion will give us critical insight into how AAP- specific changes in microbiome composition affect microbiome output and ultimately host phenotype.In conclusion these data support our hypoth-esis that AAP treatment results in measurable differences in gut microbiota composition in a well-characterized group of patients with BD.AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by the Heinz C.

Males showed no significant diversity between treatment groups p0.8.

We hypothesized that AAP treatment would associate with a significant separation in fecal microbiota communities from bipolar dis- order BD patients treated with AAPs compared with those patients with BD not treated with AAPs.MethodsParticipantsThe Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder is an ongoing observational study of BD at the University of Michigan HUM00000606.17 Medication group for each patient was defined by the use of an AAP at the time of fecal sample col- lection.
