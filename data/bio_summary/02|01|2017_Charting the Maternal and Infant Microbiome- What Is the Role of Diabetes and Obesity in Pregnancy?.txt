such studies will help to not only illuminate whether there are natural pregnancy-related changes to the gut and vaginal microbial communities and their functions but also whether these chang- es are adaptive for the health of mothers and their offspring.curr diab rep 2017 17 11page 3 of 11 11diabetes and obesity in pregnancy and the maternal microbiomealthough no investigations have directly examined the asso- ciation of gestational diabetes with the maternal body-habitat- associated microbiota during pregnancy data exist on the as- sociations of gestational diabetes with the postpartum mater- nal gut microbiota  weight status and metabolic hor- mones with the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy   and pre-pregnancy body mass index bmi and gestational weight gain with the maternal gut microbiota dur- ing pregnancy   table .fugmann and colleagues aimed to examine whether gesta- tional diabetes was associated with postpartum gut microbiota composition and structure by collecting stools 3 to 16 months post-delivery from 42 women who in their most recent preg- nancy had gestational diabetes and 35 women who had expe- rienced normoglycemic pregnancies controls .

there is also a dearth of studies on the effect of obesity excess gestational weight gain or diabetes on the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy which is a critical area for fu- ture research because of its role in seeding the infant off- spring microbiome at birth.considering the growing prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy and the potential importance of the maternal microbiome for maternal and infant health there is need for large longitudinal cohort studies of racially and ethni- cally diverse mother-child dyads with serial collection of maternal samples from early pregnancy through parturi- tion along with infant bio-specimens and clinical out- comes.

maternal diabetes in one study and pregnancy weight status in three studies were found to be associated with the infant offspring gut microbiome although some associations only appeared in certain cohort strata.this article is part of the topical collection on diabetes and pregnancy noel t. mueller sirtaj singh margaret r. karagas 1 department of epidemiology johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health 615 north wolfe street  baltimore md 21205 usa2 department of epidemiology geisel school of medicine at dartmouth one medical center drive 7927 rubin building lebanon nh 03756 usa3 welch center for prevention epidemiology and clinical research johns hopkins university baltimore md usapatterns of association across both maternal and infant microbiome studies however lacked consistency which may owe to biologic or technical differences or to the lack of control for important confounders or effect modifiers e.g.

however the authors did not stratify analyses by deliv- ery mode nor did they report if c-section rates differed by ses status delivery mode could be an important effect modifier of the maternal bmi-infant microbiota association.the impact of maternal diabetes in pregnancy on the microbiome of meconium i.e.

based on this small but growing literature base it is tempting to postulate that metformin--a drug with no known risks for the mother or fetus--could not only help ameliorate diabetes-associated dysbiosis in pregnancy but also reduce transmission of diabesogenic bacteria to the newborn.seeding and development of the infant gut microbiome mom mattersthe mother is the source of the newborn's first microbiota either through low biomass exposure before birth the rich inoculum of vaginal and gut microbiota during labor or the skin microbiota during c-section delivery .

while there has been speculation that the vaginal microbiome is colonized by the maternal gut microbiome via the rectum toward the end of pregnancy  there is limited empirical support for this hypothesis .given the lack of consensus about programmatic changes to the maternal microbiome during gestation there is need for large prospective studies that use consistent sample collection storage and processing.

although the results indicate associations of maternal weight statusand metabolic markers in pregnancy with gut microbiome composition the cross-sectional nature of this study leaves the direction of these associations uncertain.two studies have examined the impact of pre-pregnancy body weight and weight gain during pregnancy on the mater- nal gut microbiome  .

thus while we are aware of studies showing associations of gestational diabetes  and maternal pregnancy weight gain  with bacterial dna in the placenta we have focused our review on less bias-prone studies that have examined the impact of metabolic disorders in pregnancy on mother-to-newborn transmission of the rich microbial ecosystem at birth.after seeding at birth an infant's gut microbiome typically undergoes three distinct phases of development .

the authors also reported no differences in newborn meconium microbiota composition or structure by delivery mode which raises the possibility that maternal diabetes may alter the fetal acquisition of microbiota from amniotic fluid before birth.
