Such studies will help to not only illuminate whether there are natural pregnancy-related changes to the gut and vaginal microbial communities and their functions but also whether these chang- es are adaptive for the health of mothers and their offspring.Curr Diab Rep 2017 17 11Page 3 of 11 11Diabetes and Obesity in Pregnancy and the Maternal MicrobiomeAlthough no investigations have directly examined the asso- ciation of gestational diabetes with the maternal body-habitat- associated microbiota during pregnancy data exist on the as- sociations of gestational diabetes with the postpartum mater- nal gut microbiota  weight status and metabolic hor- mones with the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy   and pre-pregnancy body mass index BMI and gestational weight gain with the maternal gut microbiota dur- ing pregnancy   Table .Fugmann and colleagues aimed to examine whether gesta- tional diabetes was associated with postpartum gut microbiota composition and structure by collecting stools 3 to 16 months post-delivery from 42 women who in their most recent preg- nancy had gestational diabetes and 35 women who had expe- rienced normoglycemic pregnancies controls .

There is also a dearth of studies on the effect of obesity excess gestational weight gain or diabetes on the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy which is a critical area for fu- ture research because of its role in seeding the infant off- spring microbiome at birth.Considering the growing prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy and the potential importance of the maternal microbiome for maternal and infant health there is need for large longitudinal cohort studies of racially and ethni- cally diverse mother-child dyads with serial collection of maternal samples from early pregnancy through parturi- tion along with infant bio-specimens and clinical out- comes.

Based on this small but growing literature base it is tempting to postulate that metformin--a drug with no known risks for the mother or fetus--could not only help ameliorate diabetes-associated dysbiosis in pregnancy but also reduce transmission of diabesogenic bacteria to the newborn.Seeding and Development of the Infant Gut Microbiome Mom MattersThe mother is the source of the newborn's first microbiota either through low biomass exposure before birth the rich inoculum of vaginal and gut microbiota during labor or the skin microbiota during C-section delivery .

Likewise a study of 56 Tanzanian women 26 of whom received probiotic sup- plementation in which monthly stools were collected from 12 to 24 weeks of pregnancy to parturition found no significant changes in the gut microbiota beta diver- sity over the course of pregnancy in this study changes in alpha diversity or relative abundance of specific taxa with pregnancy were not reported .

However the authors did not stratify analyses by deliv- ery mode nor did they report if C-section rates differed by SES status delivery mode could be an important effect modifier of the maternal BMI-infant microbiota association.The impact of maternal diabetes in pregnancy on the microbiome of meconium i.e.

Mueller13Published online 7 February 2017 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York 2017AbstractPurpose of Review The purpose of this review is to summa- rize the evidence on whether diabetes obesity and related metabolic derangements during pregnancy are associated with the maternal and infant microbiomes and to identify gaps in the literature and offer guidance on future research on this topic.Recent Findings We found circumstantial evidence from four observational studies that the maternal gut microbiome was associated with either pre-pregnancy body mass index gesta- tional weight gain gestational diabetes andor related metabol- ic biomarkers in pregnancy we did not identify any studies that examined whether the vaginal microbiome varied according to these metabolic parameters.

This may be further modified by metabolic status in pregnancy.Table 1Human studies on the associations of obesity diabetes and related metabolic factors in pregnancy on the maternal gut microbiomeStudyExposureoutcomeStudy populationMethodsDiversity measuresMicrobial taxonomy measuresLimitationsFugmann et al.

Compared to mice that received the first trimester microbiota those receiving the third tri- mester microbiota gained more weight became more in- sulin resistant and had higher levels of inflammatory markers  suggesting that the gut microbiota may be responsible for pregnancy-related metabolic changes.

The authors also reported no differences in newborn meconium microbiota composition or structure by delivery mode which raises the possibility that maternal diabetes may alter the fetal acquisition of microbiota from amniotic fluid before birth.
