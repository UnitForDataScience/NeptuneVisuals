These results suggested that the gut microbiome of high feed efficiency pigs might be more available to utilize the diet protein than that of pigs with low feed efficiency.We observed that KEGG orthologies related to the metabolism and transport of monosaccharides were negatively associated with porcine feed efficiency Figure 4.

Taken together the gut microbiome of pigs with low feed efficiency may contribute to the development of host fatness that reduces feed efficiency.In conclusion we detected 31 OTUs that were potentially linked to porcine feed efficiency by an OTU-based association analysis in the 280 Duroc pigs.

2016 defined the interaction network of gut microbiota in pigs and found that the enterotype-like clustering was significantly associated with porcine growth traits.Feed efficiency is generally expressed as feed conversion ratio FCR or residual feed intake RFI also called net feed efficiency.

Understanding how the intestinal microbial community alters the host's capacity for metabolism and energy harvest is a significant issue for improving feed efficiency in the pig production industry.In this study we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to uncover the effects of host and environmental factors on the diversity of porcine gut microbial communities and to identify gut microbiota and the potential function capacity correlated with swine feed efficiency.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Feeding and ManagementA total of 280 commercial Duroc pigs including 169 males and 111 females from Shahu farm were used in this study.

Relations among individual residual feed intake growth performance and feed intake pattern of growing pigs in group housing.

We chose 18 fecal samples for metagenomic sequencing including nine samples from the pigs with the low RFI-values high feed efficiency 5 and 4  RFI -0.22 - 0.08 and nine samples with the high RFI-values low feed efficiency 4 and 5  RFI 0.094 - 0.068Supplementary Figure 1.

Improved nutrient digestibility and retention partially explains feed efficiency gains in pigs selected for low residual feed intake.

In the sPLS- DA analysis three components and 10 KEGG genes for each component were selected as the optimal parameters.RESULTSPhenotypic Values of Porcine RFI in the Experimental CohortAll experimental pigs were separately recorded daily feed intake and daily body weight gain from 30 kg 70-90 days of age to 100 kg of body weight 170-190 days of age which was the fastest growth stage of pigs.

Only bacterial phosphotransferase system PTS and phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism were more abundant in the pigs with high RFI-value while theother eight pathways such as PPAR signaling pathway amino acid metabolism fatty acid metabolism and adipocytokine signaling pathway were enriched in those individuals with low RFI-value.DISCUSSIONIn this study we investigated the fecal microbial composition of commercial Duroc pigs and systematically evaluated the association of gut microbiome with pig feed efficiency from both enterotype and microbial taxa with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing data.

The present results provided important basic knowledge for improving porcine feed efficiency through modulating gut microbiome.Keywords feed efficiency gut microbiota metagenome 16S rRNA gene swineINTRODUCTIONFeed costs account for 60-70 of the total costs involved in pig production.
