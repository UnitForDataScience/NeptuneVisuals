Some arrhythmias that can lead to SCD may involve ROS and result from inherited disorders such as in Kearns-Sayre syndrome a rare disease and in this case the diseased mitochondria seems to be the source for ROS and yet no specific therapies have been developed that target ROS in the pathophysiology of such disorders 31.Other ''rare'' mechanisms that are not because of athero- sclerotic coronary artery disease cardiac hypertrophy or channelopathies include rare conditions such as valve dis- orders arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia hemo- chromatosis coronary anomaly or sarcoidosis as examples of ''rare'' diseases that can cause common SCD 40.

Individuals with so-called common diseases may have a number of symptoms that are shared by all affected but also other distinct and more specific symptoms that result in the reclassification of the ''common'' disease in the bin of ''not as common'' or even ''rare'' illnesses Fig.

In particular victims of SCD can be very young sometimes athletes and develop SCD as a result of a ''rare'' condition of cardiac hypertrophy the most common known cause of SCD in the very young 26.

This editorial is taking into account the uniqueness of each individual and surrounding environment and stresses the point that a more accurate definition of a ''common'' disorder could be simply the amalgamation of a myriad of ''rare'' diseases.

We make the case that it is highly unlikely that such treatments despite their statistical success measured with large cohorts using standardized clinical research will be effective on all patients until we increase the depth and fidelity of our understanding of the individual ''rare'' diseases that are grouped together in the ''buckets'' of common illnesses.

''Common'' diseases may cause a few or many symptoms that can be similar or even identical to those found in ''rare'' diseases.

Con- sequently it is clear that many ''rare'' categorized conditions can result in common SCD and the SCD case is an example of an endpoint to a disease that is the result of a compendium of factors including common and rare contributing factors thus validating our belief that a common disease process is a compendium of rare diseases.When a Rare Disease Gets a Ticket to Rideas a Common Illness ROS and Virus CooperationKaposi's sarcoma KS is diagnosed on the base of one or multiple discolored purplish lesions of the skin or mucosa.

Finding new cures for all ''rare'' diseases will be at the core of the new era of big data analysis with accuracy and precision in both molecular and genetic diagnostics of deficiencies that lead to diseases and individualized therapeutic interventions re- sulting from advances in biomedical technologies at the macro- micro- and nanoscale 1 9.
