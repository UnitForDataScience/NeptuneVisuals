In addition the data suggest that B. subtilis CSL2 exerts protect- ive effects against S. Gallinarum infection by altering the faecal microbiota of broiler chickens.MethodsAnimals and experimental designA total of 36 Ross-308 broiler chickens were bred and divided into the following three groups the control group NC n  12 Salmonella-challenged SC n  12 group and Bacillus-treated BT n  12 group.

Lactobacillus is a dominant and important gut commensal genus present at frequen- cies of up to 109g Increased abundance of Lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens is considered beneficial for their health and performance Certain strains of Lactobacillus produce antimicro- bial substances exopolysaccharides and short-chain fatty acids as additional energy sources  B. subtilis CSL2 promotes the growth of beneficial lactobacilli as do other types of in-feed probiotics Furthermore Enterobacteriaceae abundance was re- duced in the BT group after 24 h of Salmonella chal- lenge and increased numbers of Enterobacteriaceae inSC broilers might imbalance the microbiota and thus exert harmful effects on the gut The impact of S. Gallinarum and B. subtilis CSL2 on the overall compos- ition of the gut microbiota can be detected within 24 h post infection Surprisingly in this study Salmonella spp.

These major bacterial phyla are also major constituents of the gut microbiota of other birds and livestock animals At the 24-h post- Salmonella challenge the abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly increased and that of Firmicutes de- creased in the SC group whereas those in the BT group had recovered to levels similar to the NC group.

In previous studies micro- bial shifts were evident after probiotic administration and pathogenic invasion  In-feed administra- tion of E. faecium NCIMB 11181 changed the microbial composition in piglets  Furthermore pathogen in- fection led to significant alterations in the chicken gut microbiota Pathogen infection disrupts gut microbial diversity and overwhelms the microbiota by producing toxins and harmful agents Lower microbial diversity indicates a reduced ability of the microbiota to maintain gut homeostasis and resist inva- sion.

No significant differences P  0.05 in alpha diversity were detected between groups using comparealphadiversity.py scriptcomposition of broiler chickens resulting in higher abundance of Firmicutes and lower abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria .At the genus level a total of 124 bacterial genera were detected in all broiler samples Additional file Table S2 which is comparable to other avians .

the high- est values of both were in the NC group and lowest in the SC group Table implying that Salmonella infec- tion negatively affects overall microbial diversity.

In addition the abundance of genes related to repair and recombination of DNA was highest in the BT group and lowest in the NC group Fig.

unclassi- fied Neisseriaceae Ruminococcus and Candidatus Arthromitus abundance in the SC group suggested the effects of S. Gallinarum infection in broilers.

The greater abundance of genes associated with the PTS system in the BT group might be beneficial to broiler chickens.
