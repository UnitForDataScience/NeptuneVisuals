Because the expression of ARF4 and miR-21-5p appears to increase intestinal epithelial permeability it is possible that ARF4 is under the control of miR-21-5p but not directly down- regulated by this miRNA.

The finding that both ARF4 and miR-21-5p were induced by the microbiota in LIECs also supports the hypothesis that ARF4 is not a direct target of miR-21-5p.

Because proteome analysis revealed that ARF4 expression was increased by the miR-21-5p inhibitor we hypothesized that ARF4 is a direct target of miR-21-5p which decreases intestinal epithelial permeability.

These results suggest that the induction of miR-21-5p expression by bacterial stimu- lation is mediated by TLRs.miR-21-5p affects intestinal epithelial permeability but not IL-8 production from IECsTo clarify the role of miR-21-5p in IECs we analyzed the effect of the miR-21-5p locked nucleic acid LNA inhibitor on intestinal epithelial permeability using filter-grown Caco-2 cells as an intestinal epithelial monolayer model.

One of these spots was identified by MS-MS analysis as ARF4 which was deemed a candidate target molecule of miR-21-5p in IECs as it had 9-fold higher expression in the presence of miR-21-5p inhibitor than in the presence of the control Fig.

These results confirmed that miR-21-5p expres- sion in IECs was induced by commensal bacteria.Furthermore we investigated the regulatory mechanism of miR-21-5p expression in the human IEC lines HT-29 SW480 and Caco-2.

Because these diseases are known to be associated with dysbio- sis of intestinal microbiota our results suggest that miR-21-5p may become a useful marker for inflammatory diseases associ- ated with intestinal dysbiosis.Although miR-21-5p is expressed at a physiological level in IECs of CV mice it does not induce severe inflammation under steady-state conditions.
