Therefore the gut microbiota in L. japonica is more complex than in L. morii.Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were detected as the dominant phyla in the intestine of L. morii .

Numbers of OTUs of intestinal microbe from hindgut contents of three individuals of L. japonica under different taxonomic level.The rarefaction and the rank abundance analysis of the microbe species from hindgut contents of L. japonica.

The microbial diversity index including Chao1 ACE Simpson and Shannon of 16S rRNA sequence library from three individuals of L. japonica at a given rarefied depth.Microflora distributions of the microbe species from hindgut contents of L. japonica in five classification levels.

There are 5415 shared function clusters existing in all of the three samples while 94 89 and 41 functional clusters of microbes distributing in each group of lamprey.DiscussionIn the present study gut content library from L. japonica contained 32 different phyla the number of which is much higher compared with gut microbiota from L. morii .

The differ- ence of gut microbiota between the two species is probably due to their different life cycle.Unlike L. japonica L. morii live in fresh water throughout their life cycle.

Firmicutes another dominant phylum in L. japonica intestine was not detected in L. morii.

In conclusion the gut microbiota of L. japonica displays little similarity with other aquatic organism of Vertebrata because of their different diets and living environments.Given the importance of microbiota in the development and maintenance of the immune system of host the characterization of the bacterial community in intestine of L. japonica will give clues for understanding the unique immune systems of lamprey.

Also the gut microbiota derived from L. japonica displays little similarity with other aquatic organism of Vertebrata after UPGMA analysis.

This study represents the first analysis of the bacterial community composition in the gut content of L. japonica.

The investigation of the gut micro- biota associated with L. japonica will broaden our understanding of this unique organism.IntroductionThe microorganisms harboring in digestive system play important roles in nutritional immune and defense functions .
