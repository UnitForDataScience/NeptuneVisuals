Rats in both immunosuppressant groups developed significant hyperglycemia with a glucose of 22 mmolL -2.1 SEM in the Sirolimus group and 16 mmolL -2.1 SEM in the Tacrolimus group Fig.

Cholesterol levels increased significantly by 4 weeks in both immunosup- pressant groups mean 3.5 mmolL - 0.3 in the Sirolimus group and mean 3.0 mmolL - 0.02 in the Tacrolimus group p  0.05 vs control Fig.

The cholesterol normalized in the Tacrolimus group following probiotic therapy but remained elevated in the Sirolimus group despite probiotics.

A pairwise Welch's two-sided t-test was used to compare the control group to each treatment group both separately by drug type and together.

In our study we exposed the animals to the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum after the immunosuppression phase and were able to demonstrate normalization of glu- cose in the tacrolimus group and improvement in the sirolimus group.

However the cholesterol levels normalized only in the tacrolimus group but not in the sirolimus group.

In our study the tacrolimus group did not develop cholesterol levels as elevated as those in the sirolimus group.

This may account for the difference in response to probiotics with the tacrolimus group having normalization of cholesterol levels as opposed to the persistent hypercholesterolemia in the sirolimus group.

However it should be noted that despite discontinuation of both immu- nosuppressants and initiation of probiotics glucose levels only normalized in the tacrolimus but not sirolimus group suggestive of a beneficial effect of the probiotic specifically in the former group.

as compared to the normal glu- cose levels of 5.7 mmolL in the control group p 0.0006.
