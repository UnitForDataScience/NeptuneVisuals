the bal microbiome from propionate-detectable individuals did not significantly differ from supraglottic samples based on b diversity analysis permanova p  0.17. the propionate- undetectable bal samples more closely resembled background samples than supraglottic samples although they were significantly different from background samples permanova p  0.01 fig- ure s2 table s3.

foxp1 is a candidate to mediate some of the inhibitory effects of scfas on cd4- and cd8- lymphocyte-mediated immune response but the role of foxp1 induction by scfas in the lung host microbial interfaceneeds confirmation in animal models with cell-specific condi- tional deletion.since lung scfas are on average 370-fold higher than blood diffusion of scfas from blood cannot explain scfas observed in the lung.

the inferred potential of the lower airway microbiome using taxonomic data  demonstrated reduction of genes in the pro- pionate and butyrate pathways in propionate-detectable samples figure s3 a finding confirmed with shotgun sequencing of bac- terial dna from bal figure s4we then measured blood and bal cd4 lymphocytes to assess whether the effectiveness of immune reconstitution correlated with enrichment of anaerobic taxa in the lung.

there was no association between blood cd4 lymphocytes and lung prevotella or veillonella relative abundance in post-art in- dividuals rho  -0.001 p  0.99 and rho  -0.074 p  0.72 respectively.

hiv-infected individuals also had a trend toward increased acetate p  0.08 but butyrate was not significantly different in bal p  0.291 due to the small number of individuals 427 with butyrate above the limits of detection.

elevated acetate or propionate correlated with greater foxp3-expressing tregs in bal cells after ppd stimulation c rho  0.644 p  0.027 and rho  0.798 p  0.009 respectively.to better understand the impact of scfas on the immune response to tb we measured ifn-g or il-17a production in pe- ripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from ten hiv-in- fected art-treated individuals who had latent tb infection.

however as bal cd4 lymphocytes decreased in hiv-infected individuals the relative abundances of prevotella or veillonella significantly increased d rho  -0.691 p  0.006 and rho  -0.581 p  0.03 respectively.discussionin this report we investigated a south african hiv-infected art- treated cohort with high incidence of tb to evaluate the charac- teristics of post-art tb susceptibility.

our observation that immunologically active anaer- obic metabolites are associated with enrichment in the lung of oral anaerobes such as prevotella illustrates potential conse- quences of post-art lung dysbiosis with increased prevotella.

the inverse correlation between lung oral anaerobes and pulmonary but not systemic cd4 lymphocytes could be due to reduced lymphocyte recruitment to the lung or due to increased destruc- tion at mucosal sites.

we also assessed the lung microbiome and metagenome to understand the characteristics of the bacterial communities associated with high pulmonary scfa concentration defined by detectable bal bronchoalveolar lavage propionate.

to better understand the lower airway environment and measured levels of lung scfas we performed bronchoscopy with bal on 27 hiv-infected individuals 19 from cape town and 8 from new york and 12 hiv-uninfected individuals from new york table s2.
