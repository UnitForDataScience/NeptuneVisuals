HIV-infected individuals also had a trend toward increased acetate p  0.08 but butyrate was not significantly different in BAL p  0.291 due to the small number of individuals 427 with butyrate above the limits of detection.

Similarly doubling butyrate or halving IL-17A increased the TB hazard 1.6-fold p  0.011 and 5.3-fold p  0.017 respectively doubling propionate or halving IL-17A increased TB hazard 1.7-fold p  0.005 and 3.7-fold p  0.047 respectively.Propionate and Butyrate Are Present in the Lungs of HIV-Infected Individuals on ART and Butyrate Impairs Cellular Immunity to TBPropionate and butyrate are anti-inflammatory via induction ofModels adjusted for age gender vital capacity body mass index andserum acetate.

Elevated acetate or propionate correlated with greater FoxP3-expressing Tregs in BAL cells after PPD stimulation C rho  0.644 p  0.027 and rho  0.798 p  0.009 respectively.To better understand the impact of SCFAs on the immune response to TB we measured IFN-g or IL-17A production in pe- ripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs from ten HIV-in- fected ART-treated individuals who had latent TB infection.

However as BAL CD4 lymphocytes decreased in HIV-infected individuals the relative abundances of Prevotella or Veillonella significantly increased D rho  -0.691 p  0.006 and rho  -0.581 p  0.03 respectively.DISCUSSIONIn this report we investigated a South African HIV-infected ART- treated cohort with high incidence of TB to evaluate the charac- teristics of post-ART TB susceptibility.

To better understand the lower airway environment and measured levels of lung SCFAs we performed bronchoscopy with BAL on 27 HIV-infected individuals 19 from Cape Town and 8 from New York and 12 HIV-uninfected individuals from New York Table S2.

Butyrate or propionate was detectable in the epithelial lining fluid ELF  of 1027 HIV-infected individuals 8 from Cape Town and 2 from New York but not in any of 12 HIV-uninfected individuals from New York A p  0.025 Mann-Whitney U test.

Thereis a trend to difference in b diversity when HIV-infected individuals with BAL-propio- nate-detectable samples are compared to HIV-infected individuals with propio-nate-undetectable samples PERMANOVA p  0.07.

Error bars are 95 confidence intervals.A principal-component analysis based on UniFrac distance demonstrates a significant difference in the b-diversity between propionate-detectable and propionate-undetectable individuals p value based on PERMANOVA.LEfSe demonstrates enrichment of anaerobes such as Prevotella or Veillonella in the lung microbiome of propionate-detectable individuals.

The BAL microbiome from propionate-detectable individuals did not significantly differ from supraglottic samples based on b diversity analysis PERMANOVA p  0.17.

We utilized 2mM butyrate  a concentration slightly lower than the range of 5.6-33 mM butyrate observed in ELF on those BAL samples with butyrate-detectable levels.
