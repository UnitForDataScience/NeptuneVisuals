Based on taxonomic classification species within the genera Vibrio Nautella Ruegeria Marinobacter Lentisphaera and Flaviobacterium were common representatives within the microbial community associated with E. pallida.Regarding the Symbiodinium composition associated with E. pallida we detected five Symbiodinium types associated with the studied Exaiptasia samples .

Recent data have shown the importance of the presence of photosymbionts Symbiodinium on the bacterial community assemblages associated with E. pallida  however we still lack baseline knowledge about the bacterial diversity and assemblages associated with this sea anemone over wide geographical distributions.

The number of permutations performed was 999 and the resemblance measure used was S17 Bray-Curtis similarity.Symbiodinium composition hosted by Exaiptasia pallida anemones To determine whether the patterns of bacterial assemblages associated with Exaiptasia pallida across the different geographical sites was correlated with differential compositionof associated Symbiodinium we conducted species genetic identification of the microalgal symbionts.

It is expected that the metabolic contribution from Symbiodinium to the anemone host has an effect structuring the associated bacterial community compared with aposymbiotic anemones lacking Symbiodinium but differential Symbiodinium species composition may not drive further changes of anemone microbiomes.When examined at the phylum level bacterial diversity and abundance associated with the cosmopolitan sea anemone E. pallida are broadly conserved across geographic localities with samples containing largely Proteobacteria and Bacteroides.

Moreover changes in the microbial community structure were revealed after rearing specimens of E. pallida in captivity within a period of just four months supporting the idea that differences in aquatic environments have a strong effect on shaping associated bacterial assemblages at the species level.The finding of Vibrio tubiashii as the most ubiquitous bacteria associated with Exaiptasia pallida found in 75 of all samples was interesting as this bacterium was recognized as a significant pathogen of several species of bivalve larvae in the 60's  .

To address this problem we analyzed whether the bacterial community associated with the cosmopolitan and model sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida shows specific patterns across worldwide populations ranging from the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

When examined at the phylum level bacterial diversity and abundance associated with E. pallida are broadly conserved across geographic space with samples containing largely Proteobacteria and Bacteroides.

Our findings suggest that environmental settings not host specificity seem to dictate bacterial community structure associated with this sea anemone.

The examination of the previously uncharacterized bacterial community associated with the cnidarian sea anemone model E. pallida is the first global-scale study of its kind.How to cite this article Brown et al.

In many marine invertebrates bacteria associated withhost epithelium have also been shown to play a pivotal role in host development .
