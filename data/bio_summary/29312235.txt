Based on the findings in most recent studies on endophytic bacteria we explore 1 which bacteria live in plant endophytic habitats2 how do endosphere bacterial communities respond to plant stresses and environmental stimuli 3 where exactly do endophytic bacteria colonize plants 4 what are the traits that enable bacteria to successfully invade and persist into standing heterogeneous communities 5 how do bacterial endophytes deal with the plant's immune system 6 how does the planthost influence endophytic colonization via hormone signaling pathways and 7 what are the traits of endophytic bacteria that deliver plant phenotypes and therefore may hold promise for use in agriculture.

Updating the insights into the mechanism of endophytic bacterial colonization and interactions with plants is an important step in potentially manipulating endophytic bacteriamicrobiome for viable strategies to improve agricultural production.Keywords biocontrol bacteria endophytic bacteria plant defense signaling plant growth promotion plant microbiomeINTRODUCTIONIt has been projected that the world's population will increase to 9.1 billion by 2050  .

Besides optimizing the PCR conditions a non- biased enrichment of endophytic bacterial cells from plant tissues may circumvent this problem  .Although there is a wealth of literature on culture- dependent and independent characterization of endophytic bacterial diversity and the associated in vitro mechanisms for plant growth promotion reports on successful use of endophytic bacteria in plants under field conditions are extremely scarce.

Exploring the plant growth promoting traits of endophytic bacteria such as boosting plant nutrient uptake or buffering capacity from abiotic stress is a relatively novel but promising area for the development of sustainable agriculture    .In this review the authors aim to discuss key issues within the scope of plants and endophytic bacteria interactions.

In the context of climate change and given the importance of endophytic bacteria for plant growth and health understanding how endophytic bacteria respond to an elevated CO2 or temperature can aid in future decision- making policies around environmental issues.

Taken all together endophytic bacteria tend to lack T3SS and T4SS that in pathogens are related to induction of defense responses but some rhizobium-type endophytic bacteria may require T3SS to establish in the plant endosphere .Production of a range of reactive oxygen species ROS is typically a non-specific tactic for plant defense to induce HR and PCD against biotrophic pathogens  .

Below we review the increasingly recognized or novel PGPTs of endophytic bacteria and discuss their potential applications in agriculture.Phytohormone ProductionProducing phytohormones is a common feature of endophytic bacteria to boost plant growth and increase plant stress tolerance  .

The importance of endophytic bacteria in N cycling is also supported by the evidence that N2 fixation by foliar endophytic bacteria has occurred in many subalpine conifer species  .

We believe that understanding the interactions between endophytic bacteria and their plant hosts will assist in the design of new strategies for productive and sustainable practices in agriculture.BIODIVERSITY AND ACQUISITION OF ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIADifferent plant organs are associated with different endophytic bacterial communities in terms of diversity and composition.

This study also provides evidence to suggest that particular functional attributes of endophytic bacteria are induced in plants suffering from stress.DISTRIBUTION OF ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA AND COLONIZATION PATTERNSBacterial colonization patterns in plant endophytic compartments have thus far been mainly studied in grasses e.g.
