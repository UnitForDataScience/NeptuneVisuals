Dysregulation of FoxP3 Treg cells hyperactivation of effector T cells in- creased circulating memory T cells and lymphocytic infil- tration of target organs were evidenced.

CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency also causes progressive loss of circulat- ing B cells associated with an increase of predominantly autoreactive CD21lo B cells and accumulation of B cells in non-lymphoid organs.

It also needs binding of CD80 and CD86 ligands on the antigen-presenting cells with CD28 co-stimulatory receptor on the T cells  .

Anti-CTLA- 4 mAbs reactivate T cells that are primed in lymphoid organs regardless of the antigen specificity and therefore affect amuch wider repertoire of T cells than those involved in the anti-cancer response  .

It is therefore not surprising that ipilimumab induces immune-related adverse events enteroco- litis is one of the most frequent of them.The role of CTLA-4 in intestinal homeostasisCTLA-4 is upregulated on naive T cells upon activation but it is also expressed in a high proportion of Treg cells which play an important role in intestinal homeostasis.

Anti-CTLA-4 mAbs might also induce the depletion of Treg cells which express CTLA-4.

These cells are susceptible to antibody-dependent cell-medi- ated cytotoxicity after binding of anti-CTLA-4 antibody to the CD16-expressing monocytes and macrophages -.

In an experimental colitis model based upon T cell transfers antibodies to CTLA-4 induced colitis by targeting Treg cells and disrupting their activ- ity thereby abolishing their immunomodulatory role .

This effect was due to the blockade of the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligand not by depletion of CTLA-4 Treg cells .
