Since 90- 95 of the total RNA consists of ribosomal RNA the Ribominus Transcriptome Isolation Kit Yeast and Bacteria Invitrogen USA was applied according to the manual and the RNA was precipitated with the help of glycogen and two volumes 100 ethanol.

The RNA was extracted from the gel slice as described Results of pilot experiments showed that RNase I cuts the 5' ends of the 16S rRNA producing a fragment of about the size expected for the footprints contributing about 50 to the size-selected RNA fragments after sequencing.

Wright5 Cameron Smith5 Rolf Backofen5 Romy Wecko1 Daniel A. Keim3 and Siegfried Scherer1BackgroundBacterial RNA molecules consist of non-coding RNAs ncRNAs including rRNAs and tRNAs and protein-coding mRNAs.

To even further reduce the possibility that the expressed RNA and not the peptide itself causes the phenotype we changed all codons of the ORF such that the same peptide is produced but the underlying RNA sequence differs maximally from the wild type sequence P2.

If this opening facilitates ribosomal binding for translation initiation of the RyhB RNA and subse- quent progression of ribosomes along the RNA must remain open.ConclusionIn the past very short proteins or peptides were ex- cluded from annotation and believed to be unlikely.

The RNA population which is covered by ribosomes is termed translatome and bioinformatics tools are now available to analyze these novel data Combined with strand-specific RNA-sequencing we suggest that this approach provides additional evidence to distin- guish between non-coding RNAs and RNAs covered by ribosomes.In the past RNAs have been found which function as ncRNA i.e.

To ensure that RNA which is not protected by ribosomes is fully digested and to get a highly enriched ribosomal fraction the procedure of RNase-digestion and gradient centrifugation was repeated The ribosomal fraction was diluted 11 with gradient buffer without SYBR Gold and sucrose and was loaded on a sucrose gradient without the 10 sucrose layer.

The FASTQ files were mapped to the reference genome NC002655 using Bowtie2  with default settings except for a changed seed length of 19 nt and zero mismatches permittedRCV thresholdsTo distinguish between translated and non-translated for a given RNA the ribosomal coverage value i.e.

For instance some mRNAs are blocked by riboswitches or bound byTable 1 Transcriptome and translatome profiles of 115 ncRNAs known from E. coli O157H7 EDL933Table 1 Transcriptome and translatome profiles of 115 ncRNAs known from E. coli O157H7 EDL933 ContinuedTable 1 Transcriptome and translatome profiles of 115 ncRNAs known from E. coli O157H7 EDL933 Continued The P values give the probability that the RCV of the given RNA is similar to  results from the RCV distribution of the tRNAs.

A sufficiently high number of RNA molecules are needed to generate a signal passing the detection threshold a problem also common to mi- croarrays Putative functions and differential expression of the novel ncRNAsTo examine putative functions of the novel ncRNA can- didates we used the sRNA target prediction tool CopraRNA  For 14 of the 150 novel ncRNAs a significant functional enrichment was found Table The targets include a diversity of metabolic and regula- tory functions within the cell e.g.
