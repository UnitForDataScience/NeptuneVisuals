By contrast the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is resistant to lipocalin-2 and can thus outcompete the pathogen for iron .Commensal bacteria develop complex ecological networks with other bacteria in the gut to acquire micronutrients.

Gram- negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli require less magnesium than Gram-positive bacteria.

The availability of micronutrients theoretically modulates microbiota networks by allowing the expansion of bacteria that are more efficient at competing for micronutrients.

illustrates how these deficiencies affect the composition and function of gut microbiota and further how differ- ent species realize changes in gene expression and cellularmetabolism to cope with micronu- trient shortages.Diet is a major factor that shapes the gut microbiota and microbiome .

ele- gantly illustrated that a diet devoid of one single micronutrient vitamin A iron zinc or folic acid or devoid of all of the four aforementioned molecules disrupted the gut microbiota composition and function in gnotobiotic mice colonized with spe- cific human microbiota.

Abbreviations Vit E vitamin E Vit A vitamin A.illustrating the importance of studying the impact of micronutrient metabolism by the microbiota and how micronutrients alter the composition and function of the microbiota as well as host physiology and health.

In bacteria a number of micronutrients are substrates and cofactors for a vari- ety of physiological processes includ- ing DNA synthesis and repair growth signal transduction transamination methyl transfer reactions decarboxyl- ation and extracellular processes such as electron transfer as well as the establishment of symbiotic associations within the gut .

However there is little information known about bacterial genomic regulation and intes- tinal microbial ecosystem equilibrium when key micronutrients for physiologi- cal processes are insufficiently deliv- ered from either other bacteria or the gut environment.A recent study by Hibberd et al.

Responding effectively to stress allows bacteria to survive in otherwise unfriendly environments.

For instance vitamin A defi- ciency promotes the fitness of segmented filamentous bacteria while vitamin C and E deficienciesinhibit the abundance of Bacteroides .
