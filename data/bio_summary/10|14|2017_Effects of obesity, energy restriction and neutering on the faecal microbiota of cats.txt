average food intake by obese cats during ad libitum and energy restriction phases was 737 and 516 gd respectively.body weight and compositionthere were no differences in bw lean or fm between the lean intact and lean neutered cats 1. the lean neutered cats had a lower p  005 lean body mass compared with the obese neutered cats.

while not meeting the p  01 cutoff as a trend the lean intact and lean neutered group include a nearly 25-fold reduced abundance of prevotella p  0104 however these differences were not statistically significant because of high variability among individual cats 4. correlations among bacterial genera and age bw lean and fm are presented in 3. several bacteria significantly correlated with age and body composition.discussionto our knowledge this is the first study comparing gut microbial diversity in lean intact lean neutered and obesedownloaded from .

the aim of this study was to compare the feline faecal microbiota composition in 1 lean neutered and lean intact cats 2 lean neutered and obese neutered cats and3 obese neutered cats before and after 6 weeks of energy restriction with the goal of identifying microbial shifts that occur with neutering or energy restriction.methodsapproval of the experimental protocol protocol 17261 was granted by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of california davis.animals and dietsin all twenty-four adult range 1-12 years median age 64 years specific pathogen free domestic shorthair cats owned by the university of california were used in this study.

within the firmicutes phylum lachnospiraceae peptostreptococcaceae veillonellaceae and ruminococcaceae were the predominant families identified in cat faeces 3. the greater abun- dance of firmicutes and reduced proportions of bacteroidetes in the lean neutered cats compared with obese neutered cats was driven by significantly greater proportions of peptos- treptococcaceae p  0015 and reduced proportions of prevotellaceae p  005. an unidentified family within the order bacteroidales showed a trend for an increase in the obese neutered cats p  0077. there were notable family-level dif- ferences between lean intact and lean neutered cats however these did not reach statistical significance.

for group comparisons ancova was performed with sex and age as covariates c. significance of differences between lean intact v. lean neutered cats and lean neutered v. obese neutered cats was assessed bytukey's honest significant difference test while controlling for a family-wise type i error.

we also observed the genus clostridium to negatively correlate with lean body mass and positively correlate with fm in the lean intact and lean neutered cats.

this study aimed to determine whether alterations in intestinal bacteria were associated with obesity energy restriction and neutering by characterising faecal microbiota using 16s rrna gene sequencing in eight lean intact eight lean neutered and eight obese neutered cats before and after 6 weeks of energy restriction.

there were no other phylum-level differences between lean intact and lean neutered cats or obese neutered cats before and after energy restriction.family-level faecal microbiota.

there were eight obese four male and four female eight lean intact four male and four female and eight lean neutered six male and two female cats.

the lean intact four male and four female mean age 575 years range 1-10 years and lean neutered six male and two female mean age 625 years range 4-12 years cats were group-housed and consumed the previously described diet ad libitum for at least 8 weeks.

there was also a trend p  010 towards the lean neutered cats showing this same shift in firmicutes and bacteroidetes populations compared with the lean intact cats.
