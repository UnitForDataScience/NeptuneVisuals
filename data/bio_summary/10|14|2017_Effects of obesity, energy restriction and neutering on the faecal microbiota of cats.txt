The aim of this study was to compare the feline faecal microbiota composition in 1 lean neutered and lean intact cats 2 lean neutered and obese neutered cats and3 obese neutered cats before and after 6 weeks of energy restriction with the goal of identifying microbial shifts that occur with neutering or energy restriction.MethodsApproval of the experimental protocol Protocol 17261 was granted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California Davis.Animals and dietsIn all twenty-four adult range 1-12 years median age 64 years specific pathogen free domestic shorthair cats owned by the University of California were used in this study.

Partial least squares-discriminant analysis reveals discriminating characteristics of genus-level microbiota with respect to neutering between lean intact   v. lean neutered   a obesity lean neutered   v. obese neutered   b and energy restriction obese neutered   before v. after energy restriction   energy-restricted ER-obese c. Inset in each panel displays the scores plot clustering based on group assignment with the coloured ellipses representing the 95  confidence of the populations as calculated based on Hotelling's T2 test each symbol represents an individual cat.

For group comparisons ANCOVA was performed with sex and age as covariates c. Significance of differences between lean intact v. lean neutered cats and lean neutered v. obese neutered cats was assessed byTukey's honest significant difference test while controlling for a family-wise type I error.

Average food intake by obese cats during ad libitum and energy restriction phases was 737 and 516 gd respectively.Body weight and compositionThere were no differences in BW lean or FM between the lean intact and lean neutered cats 1.

We also observed the genus Clostridium to negatively correlate with lean body mass and positively correlate with FM in the lean intact and lean neutered cats.

This study aimed to determine whether alterations in intestinal bacteria were associated with obesity energy restriction and neutering by characterising faecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in eight lean intact eight lean neutered and eight obese neutered cats before and after 6 weeks of energy restriction.

The lean neutered cats had a lower P  005 lean body mass compared with the obese neutered cats.

There were no other phylum-level differences between lean intact and lean neutered cats or obese neutered cats before and after energy restriction.Family-level faecal microbiota.
