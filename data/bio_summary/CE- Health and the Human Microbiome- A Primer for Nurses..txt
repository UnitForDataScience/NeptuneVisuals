That said there is evidence that vaginal dysbiosis an imbalance of the vaginal microbi- ota characterized by potentially harmful combinations of certain types and levels of bacteria is common in women of reproductive age.57 60Vaginal dysbiosis includes bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis in the United States up to 50 of women of reproductive age may be affected.61 Poten- tial adverse effects include vaginal discomfort un- wanted odor and itching increased risk of preterm birth and postpartum infection poor outcomes in future pregnancies and increased incidence of sexu- ally transmitted infections including HIV.62-67 No sin- gle microbial community profile is associated with bacterial vaginosis or other vaginal dysbioses but these conditions are typically characterized by a pau- city of lactobacilli and elevated vaginal pH greater than 5.Factors correlated with bacterial vaginosis and other changes in vaginal microbiota have been welldocumented.63 65 68 69 Hygienic and sexual practices that have been linked to vaginal dysbiosis include douching using vaginal lubricants and having a greater number of sexual partners.65 68 69 Research indicates that certain bacterial species are generally more prevalent during dysbiosis.70 Yet bacteria asso- ciated with bacterial vaginosis are sometimes present in moderate amounts in women with no accompa- nying signs or symptoms of illness.57 60 This suggests that other factors such as genetics or immune sys- tem interactions may be relevant in progression to a symptomatic or harmful state but at this writing such factors remain unexplored.In addition to providing protection against infec- tion the vaginal microbiota contribute to neonatal GI tract colonization during birth.17 19 It's imperative that we learn more about the structure and functions that vaginal microbiota play during pregnancy and more researchers are including pregnant women in their studies.

For decades it's been known that lactobacilli are integral members of the vaginal microbiota.49 Lactic acid produced by lacto- bacilli contributes to the acidic environment of the vagina.50 The low vaginal pH typically 3.5 to 4.5 enhances the protective function of vaginal microbi- ota by preventing pathogenic overgrowth and subse- quent infection.51In recent years 16S rRNA gene profiling has dem- onstrated that the vaginal microbiota transform over the course of the female life cycle in response to hor- monal changes that occur during puberty pregnancy and menopause.52 53 A small number of studies have focused on the vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls these have found that as girls progress through the stages of puberty lactobacilli become more abundant even before menarche.54 55 Similarly few studies have focused on the vaginal microbiota in postmenopausal women.

For example the practice of douching is still common in certain cul- tures.73 Yet studies have shown that douching is as- sociated with an increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis.65 74 Women presenting with bacterial vag- inosis should be asked about douching habits and provided with education on safer hygienic practices as warranted.The stability of the vaginal microbiota is crucial during pregnancy because of the role that vaginal de- livery plays in establishing an infant's GI microbiota.

Thus establishing the con- stituents of the GI microbiota early in life is critical if this process is disrupted there may be lasting detri- mental effects.18 27The composition of a child's GI microbiota gener- ally resembles that of an adult's once breastfeeding ceases and solid food dominates the diet--a transition that typically occurs between the ages of one and three years.19 21 29 It's been estimated that by adult- hood there are more than 1000 different species of bacteria in the GI tract depending on dietary intake environmental exposures such as antibiotics and physiologic maturation.3 4 30 31 In general an adult's GI microbiota contains species belonging to four major bacterial phyla Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Actinobac- teria and Proteobacteria.

Factors Influencing GI and Vaginal MicrobiotaBMI  body mass index GI  gastrointestinal.the many functions of the GI tract and that GI micro- biota are unique when compared with microbiota found elsewhere in or on the human body.VAGINAL MICROBIOTAThe vaginal microbiota includes all microbes residing in the vagina and the ectocervix.

It's imperative for perinatal nurses to understand that common practices such as antibiotic administration and lubricant use during labor and delivery can alter the composition of the vaginal microbiota leading to suboptimal colonization of the newborn.68 75 Perinatal nurses can minimize the number of vaginal examina- tions involving lubricants during labor.

One study conducted in mice given humanized gut ecosystems found that switching from a low-fat plant-rich diet to a high-fat high-sugar Western diet shifted the composition of the GI microbiota within a single day.46 Similarly a small study among humans found that consuming a diet emphasizing animal- based foods such as meat eggs and cheese resulted in increased levels of bile-tolerant microbes and de- creased levels of Firmicutes which metabolize dietary plant sugars within days.47 Longer-term dietary pat- terns also influence GI microbiota.

De Filippo and colleagues compared the GI microbiota of rural Af- rican children who typically consume a low-fat low-protein high-fiber diet with those of European children who typically consume a high-fat high- protein low-fiber diet and found significant differ- ences.48 For example Bacteroidetes species which are involved in the fermentation of complex carbo- hydrates were more abundant in the GI microbiota of the African children than the European children 58 and 22 respectively.

Firmicutes species which are often associated with obesity were more abundant in the GI microbiota of the European chil- dren than the African children 64 and 27 re- spectively.Taken together such findings strongly suggest that the structure of the GI microbiota is closely tied toFigure 1.

There is also evidence that it's the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods that influences the development of the GI microbiota.19 Backhed and colleagues found that compared with infants still being breastfed those who had stopped breastfeeding had gut microbiota that more closely resembled those found in adults.19 The researchers noted that such bacteria have last- ing effects on essential processes such as metabo- lism and may play a role in brain development.In both children and adults antibiotic administra- tion and unhealthy eating behaviors can induce per- turbations in the GI microbiota that may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome or autoim- mune diseases.
