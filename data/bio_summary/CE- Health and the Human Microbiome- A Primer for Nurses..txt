that said there is evidence that vaginal dysbiosis an imbalance of the vaginal microbi- ota characterized by potentially harmful combinations of certain types and levels of bacteria is common in women of reproductive age.57 60vaginal dysbiosis includes bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis in the united states up to 50 of women of reproductive age may be affected.61 poten- tial adverse effects include vaginal discomfort un- wanted odor and itching increased risk of preterm birth and postpartum infection poor outcomes in future pregnancies and increased incidence of sexu- ally transmitted infections including hiv.62-67 no sin- gle microbial community profile is associated with bacterial vaginosis or other vaginal dysbioses but these conditions are typically characterized by a pau- city of lactobacilli and elevated vaginal ph greater than 5.factors correlated with bacterial vaginosis and other changes in vaginal microbiota have been welldocumented.63 65 68 69 hygienic and sexual practices that have been linked to vaginal dysbiosis include douching using vaginal lubricants and having a greater number of sexual partners.65 68 69 research indicates that certain bacterial species are generally more prevalent during dysbiosis.70 yet bacteria asso- ciated with bacterial vaginosis are sometimes present in moderate amounts in women with no accompa- nying signs or symptoms of illness.57 60 this suggests that other factors such as genetics or immune sys- tem interactions may be relevant in progression to a symptomatic or harmful state but at this writing such factors remain unexplored.in addition to providing protection against infec- tion the vaginal microbiota contribute to neonatal gi tract colonization during birth.17 19 it's imperative that we learn more about the structure and functions that vaginal microbiota play during pregnancy and more researchers are including pregnant women in their studies.

it's now recog- nized that microbes once unequivocally regarded as dangerous invaders often serve us as integral com- panions providing critical functions in fundamental human processes.the human microbiome is so intrinsically linked to human physiology that it's now considered a discrete body organ in its own right.1 2 indeed it's been esti- mated that the human body contains at least as many microbial cells as human cells with microbial genes vastly outnumbering human genes.3-5 furthermorethe microbial communities that make up the human microbiome are found in every niche of the body in- cluding on the skin in the ears and in the gastroin- testinal gi and reproductive tracts.

for decades it's been known that lactobacilli are integral members of the vaginal microbiota.49 lactic acid produced by lacto- bacilli contributes to the acidic environment of the vagina.50 the low vaginal ph typically 3.5 to 4.5 enhances the protective function of vaginal microbi- ota by preventing pathogenic overgrowth and subse- quent infection.51in recent years 16s rrna gene profiling has dem- onstrated that the vaginal microbiota transform over the course of the female life cycle in response to hor- monal changes that occur during puberty pregnancy and menopause.52 53 a small number of studies have focused on the vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls these have found that as girls progress through the stages of puberty lactobacilli become more abundant even before menarche.54 55 similarly few studies have focused on the vaginal microbiota in postmenopausal women.

firmicutes species which are often associated with obesity were more abundant in the gi microbiota of the european chil- dren than the african children 64 and 27 re- spectively.taken together such findings strongly suggest that the structure of the gi microbiota is closely tied tofigure 1. factors influencing gi and vaginal microbiotabmi  body mass index gi  gastrointestinal.the many functions of the gi tract and that gi micro- biota are unique when compared with microbiota found elsewhere in or on the human body.vaginal microbiotathe vaginal microbiota includes all microbes residing in the vagina and the ectocervix.

for example the practice of douching is still common in certain cul- tures.73 yet studies have shown that douching is as- sociated with an increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis.65 74 women presenting with bacterial vag- inosis should be asked about douching habits and provided with education on safer hygienic practices as warranted.the stability of the vaginal microbiota is crucial during pregnancy because of the role that vaginal de- livery plays in establishing an infant's gi microbiota.

it's imperative for perinatal nurses to understand that common practices such as antibiotic administration and lubricant use during labor and delivery can alter the composition of the vaginal microbiota leading to suboptimal colonization of the newborn.68 75 perinatal nurses can minimize the number of vaginal examina- tions involving lubricants during labor.

for women given antibiotics nurses can emphasize the increased need for other actions associated with healthier neo- natal gi colonization such as immediate and longer- term breastfeeding.perinatal nurses should also know that cesarean- born infants have different gi tract colonization pat- terns than vaginally born infants19 76 and may be at higher risk for adverse outcomes such as asthma and childhood obesity.17 77 78 one recent study by dominguez-bello and colleagues explored the poten- tial for inoculating cesarean-born infants with their mother's vaginal fluids.79 while the early results were promising--the researchers reported partial resto- ration of vaginal microbes into the infants' micro- bial communities--further research is needed before this intervention can be introduced into the clinical setting.

the impact that these various microbial communities have on human health makes it imperative for nurses to understand their basic structures and functions.this article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge about the human microbiome and the implications for nursing practice.

we focus particu- larly on the microbiota in the gi tract and the vagina as these are the most commonly studied body sites.studying the human microbiomebefore dna technology became readily available in the 1980s researchers had limited options for studying the human microbiome.

although at this writing neither the optimal healthy microbes and microbial communities nor their mechanisms have been fully identified fecal transplantation using specimens from healthy donors has reportedly been shown to alleviate symptoms ofdifficile infection by restoring the balance of an al- tered microbial community.82 more research inves- tigating indications for and methodologies of fecal transplantation is currently under way.83there is no doubt that the human microbiome profoundly influences human health and the body of evidence in this area is growing rapidly.

for example vaginal and oral swabs taken from the same person will yield even greater differ- ences indicating that each body site has a distinct composition that likely relates to the functions of the microbes at that site.11gi microbiotathe microbiota in the gut inhabit the entire gi tract from the oral cavity to the rectum.

at birth infants come into physical contact with micro- bial communities in the birth canal during vaginal de- liveries and on the skin of hospital staff and parents during cesarean deliveries.17 18 the mode of micro- bial exposure at birth combined with other early life factors contributes to varying gi tract colonization patterns among infants.19 20the other factors that influence the development of the gi microbiota include the feeding method breastor bottle medications given during the neonatal and infancy periods and exposures in the external environment such as via siblings.19 21-24 backhed and colleagues found that exclusively breastfed infants harbored more gut bacteria that are often used as pro- biotics.19 other researchers have found that formula- fed infants have a higher abundance of clostridium difficile in the gi tract.22 24 c. difficile an opportunis- tic pathogen that can cause severe gastric disturbances has also been associated with later development of al- lergies.25not surprisingly infants treated with antibiotics show differences in the bacterial composition of the gi tract when compared with untreated infants.19 23 24 the implications of this are not well understood.
