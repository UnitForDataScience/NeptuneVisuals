The database for human anti-targets human gut microbiota and list of pathogenic organisms were compiled from literature Shanmugham and Pan 2013 Raman et al.

This necessitates the filtering out of microbial proteins that share structural similarity with human gut flora proteome in the target identification workflow  Raman et al.

This module helps to screen out se- quences that show significant sequence similarity to known human anti-targets.Non-homology analysis against human gut flora proteomes This module helps to screen out sequences that share high sequence similarity with human gut microbiota.

The server is hosted on Apache 2.4 webserver.A brief description of the use of various modules available in PBIT is described belowSpecificity analysisNon-homology analysis against human proteomeThis module helps to filter out sequences that share high sequence similarity with human proteome UP000005640.

The sequence similarity of the input sequences to the human proteome is com- puted using BLAST.Non-homology analysis against human anti-targetsProteins that trigger hazardous side effects under the influence of a drug are termed as 'anti-targets'.
