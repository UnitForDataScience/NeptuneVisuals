The direct pathway for Puptake is through root hairs or the root epidermis restricting P uptake to the soil volume closest to the root surface.

Many members in the plant growth promoting bacteria group can alter root architecture and morphology by synthesizing major plant hormones such as auxin and ethylene stimulating the formation of lateral roots decreasing primary root length and increasing root hairs - indirectly influencing the effectiveness of soil foraging      .

Site level P availability is presented as an average of the nine cores taken at each site.Root ClustersThe first three most distal ends of the root were collected for the root phosphatase assay according to recent studies that indicate functional differences in the root system.

In total 12 root clusters were collected from Icacos 9 root clusters from Ridge and 9 root clusters from Valley n 3 per tree species.

Linear regressions of average root PME and root PDE at each site with respect to average resin P availability indicated a negatively correlated trend between root phosphatase and P availability.

As expected root phosphatase was negatively correlated with resin P availability supporting the view that root phosphatase may be an important functional trait that forms a critical aspect of nutrient acquisition in low P environments.Our second hypothesis that phosphatase activity would be influenced by tree species was supported by both root and bacterial two-way repeated measures MANOVAs albeit our limited sample size.

Similarly a comparison between lianas and trees demonstrated that roots of lianas seem to favor high P acquisition correlated with root traits such as greater root branching intensity higher N and P concentrations and higher specific root lengths   .

Furthermore our results indicated that tree species played an important role in determining root and bacterial PME activity supporting efforts to build more species-specific trait understanding of P mineralization.The root system is highly plastic responding to variations in P availability through changes in root morphology architecture exudation and interactions with soil microbes    .

Numerous reviews describe how this intimate association between trees and fungi influence root branching fine roots root shoot ratio specific root length and responses to elevated CO2 as well as the finer details of the root- fungal interface and the exchange of nutrients          .
