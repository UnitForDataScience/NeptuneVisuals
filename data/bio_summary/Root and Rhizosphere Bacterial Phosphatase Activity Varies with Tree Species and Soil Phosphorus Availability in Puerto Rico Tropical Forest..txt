These results are certainly consistent with previous findings that point to the importance of tree species and of plant functional groups in determining phosphatase activity          .The importance of tree species on root phosphatase can also be tied to the combination of conservative and acquisitive traits that regulate tissue P demand and therefore the necessity of acquiringP via root phosphatase.

We hypothesized that 1 phosphatase activity would be higher in areas with low P availability 2 within a site tree species would differ in phosphatase activity and 3 bacterial community composition would primarily depend on tree species.

Indeed the role of phosphatase activity in determining P mineralization is likely to depend on merging how phosphatase correlates with other root functional traits and the microbial community.Finally our third hypothesis that bacterial communities would be largely influenced by tree species was contradicted by results that indicated the significance of site but not of tree species in determining bacterial community composition.

The improved understanding of variations among different tree species of root and bacterial function may provide a means to improve representation of tropical forests in ecosystem models and help us gain a more thorough understanding of how roots and their bacterial community enable tropical forests to thrive in severely limited P soils.To understand how root and bacterial function differed by tree species and soil P availability we assessed phosphatase activity in roots and bacterial isolates.

However it is important to note that site is likely to be a confounding factor with tree species given that the soil environment can modify thesefunctional traits      .Although our alpha level of 0.05 excluded site as a significant determinant of root and bacterial phosphatase activity we suspect that they are likely influenced by feedbacks between site and tree species.

Though tree species was the only significant factor in root phosphatase activity there was a negative trend between soil P availability and phosphatase activity in linear regressions of average root phosphatase and resinP.

The lack of an interaction term between site and tree species suggests that tree species is driving differences in root phosphatase activity independently.

In addition PDE activity of P. montana differed from C. schreberiana p- value  0.05.The initial MANOVA of root phosphatase as related to siteand tree species indicated the significant effect of tree species but not of site in determining enzyme activity.

The variation of root phosphatase with tree species is encouraging as it may be an important trait for predicting how different tree species respond in altered climatic regimes.

As expected root phosphatase was negatively correlated with resin P availability supporting the view that root phosphatase may be an important functional trait that forms a critical aspect of nutrient acquisition in low P environments.Our second hypothesis that phosphatase activity would be influenced by tree species was supported by both root and bacterial two-way repeated measures MANOVAs albeit our limited sample size.
