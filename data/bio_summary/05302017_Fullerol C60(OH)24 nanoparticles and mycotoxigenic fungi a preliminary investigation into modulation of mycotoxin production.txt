but further measurements were not performed.Influence of FNP on mycelial growth oxidative stress and aflatoxin concentration The effect of FNP on mycelial growth is shown in Fig.

In opposition to our results they determined a stimulation of aflatoxin synthesis by FNP and taken at face value the results may reflect the unpredictable nature of FNPapparent in our results too weaker inhibition of toxin synthe- sis at higher FNP levels.

However it cannot be excluded that FNP interfered with the enzymes in the aflatoxin bioynthesis pathway andor the re- lease of aflatoxin from the fungal cell.

There is little information available on the interaction of mycotoxigenic fungi and FNP despite FNP having a great potential of modifying mycotoxin production.

Strong anti-aflatoxigenic activity of FNP was detected in the presence of 10 and 100 ngmL whereas no aflatoxins were detected in YES medium after 48 h of growth in the presence of 10 ngmL nor after 72 h of growth at 100 ngmL of FNP.

Thereafter the activity rapidly fell except for the greatest FNP level which retained high activity for 72 h.Elevated Mn-SOD activity was detected in mycelia grown in the presence of 100 and 1000 ngmL of FNP for 96 and 120 h which was the beginning of the stationary growth phase Fig.

They also reported a reduction in A. flavus mycelial biomass weight in the presence of FNP which corresponds with our results at the highest FNP concentration.

The latter could also explain the impaired fungal growth as a consequence of afla- toxin accumulation within cells.The weaker anti-mycotoxigenic effect of FNP at the highest dose may imply a different behaviour of FNP andor fungal cell reaction at lower 10 and 100 ngmL vs higher concentrations 1000 ngmL in this particular medium Fig.

In order to shed some light on the extent of interaction between FNP and mycotoxigenic fungi the effects of fullerol C60OH24 nanoparticles 10 100 1000 ngmL on mycelial growth aflatoxin production and oxidative stress modulation in an aflatoxigenic strain of Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3251 during 168 h of incubation in a liquid culture medium were examined.

FNP slightly reduced mycelial biomass weight but significantly decreased aflatoxin concentration in media.
