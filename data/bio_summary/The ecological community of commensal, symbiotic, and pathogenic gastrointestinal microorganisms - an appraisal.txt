the aim of this study was to review and discuss how the human body interacts with its gut microbiome and in turn the effects that the microorganisms have on its host overall resulting in a true mutualistic relationship.keywords gastrointestinal commensal symbiotic pathogenic microorganismsnational defense university of malaysia kem sungai besi kualalumpur malaysiaintroductionthe word microbiome was first coined by american molecular biologist dr joshua lederberg to imply the environmental and biological community of commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that share human body space and have been all but ignored as elements of health and disease.1 the microbiome is defined as the overall collection of microbiota that resides inside humans or on their skin surface.2-5 it has been recognized for some time that the human body is colonized by at least ten times more bacteria than the figure of human cells in the body and that most of these bacteria live in the human gastrointestinal gi territory.6-8 it has been estimated that 10-100 trillion commensal bacteria occupy the human gi tract therefore the figure that vastly outnumbers the number of cells of human origin.589 nevertheless the total cell number of a human being ranges between 102 and 1016 and it is widely mentioned without a proper reference.10 in a recent report it was found that the number of cells in the human microbiota is likely to be highly variable depending on nutritional input body size age ethnicity culture and environment.11 although worldwide most research has concentrated on micro- organisms that cause disease and microbial drug resistance due to unknown reasons studies on the microbiome and their its benefits in the human body did has not had a similar prioritisation or urgency as those on pathogenic microorganismsin many communities and countries.712-19 there are an innumerable variety of microorganismscorrespondence mainul haque unit of pharmacology faculty ofmedicine and defense health national defense university of malaysia kem sungai besi 57000 kuala lumpur malaysiatel 60 1 0926 5543email in nature many of which can cause diseases in humans.

there is more of a mutualistic nature to the bond shared by human host and bacterial colonizers in that the relationship benefits both parties the microbiome is provided with an environment to live in and a readily available source of nutrients and the human receives metabolites from bacterial digestion which it could not have otherwise obtained.29-31 as the human hostages the gut microbiome gains a level of stability that suggests a strong interrelationship between host and bacteria which has evolved over a substantial period.3233 in addition in the process of digestion and metabolism these bacteria play an important role in the immune system and other body functions.3435 over the last 20 years it has been shown that it is possible to modulate the composition and metabolic activities of the gut microbiome such that the health benefits to the host are maximized while reducing the deleterious effects of pathogenic organisms.3436-39 this has made the study of the microbiome a subject of great interest.anatomy of the gut and bacterial compositionsthe gi tract starts at the mouth connects to the esophagus and thence to the stomach and small and large intestines and ends at the rectum.

the transit of contents through the colon takes considerably longer time which provides time for complex microbial communities to develop.42 currently the microbe population living in the human intestine is named gut microbiota previously known as gut flora.43 human gut microbiota comprises tens of trillions of microorganisms counting at least 1000 different species of known bacteria with more than three million genes 150 times more thanhuman genes.4344 the most abundant species belong to the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes which account for up to 90 of all the bacteria in the distal gut.45 human intestine accommodates multifarious-community microbial cells that have an impact on humanoid physiology metabolism nutrition and immune function while disruption to the gut microbiota has been linked with gi conditions such as inflam- matory bowel disease ibd and obesity.37digestion in the human gutit was traditionally considered that the main function of the large intestine was principally the reclamation of water and salts and that it had little or no role in digestive processes which occurred in the stomach and small intestine.

however traditional food regimes rich in plant polysac-charides are linked with a prevotella enterotype.52112 it also reported that such a typical diet can cause 71 upsurge in plasma levels of endotoxins proposing that endotoxemia may progress in folks with gi barrier dysfunction associated with dysbiosis.113 dietary polyphenols extant in a wide-range of vegetables and fruits have been associated with positive health benefits.114115 it has also been reported that variances in the dispersal of bacteria are linked with dietary habits and this in reality provocates and promotes the host to be exposed to microbial metabolites.115 another group of scientist revealed that the gut microbiome of children living in remote west african countries was significantly different from that of the children of the same age from the most sophisticated european countries.116 similar observation of differences in gut microbiome was found between communities in rural and urban areas and residents in non-industrialized and industrialized societies.117118 multiple studies reported that dietary polyphenols are entrusted to conserve the intestinal health by protecting the gut microbial equilibrium through the encouragement of the development of beneficial bacte- ria ie lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria wielding prebiotic-like properties.119-125fecal microbiota transplantation fmtfmt or bacteriotherapy is the relocation of stool from a healthy giver into the gi tract with the determination of treating recurrent clostridium difficile colitis.126 c. difficile infection cdi is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the infection rates are increasing.127-129 cdi treatment choices are restricted and seem to lose efficacy due to resistance.

recent study pigeonholed a placental microbiome profile and found that nonpathogenic commensal microbiota from the firmicutes tenericutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and fusobacteria phyla.166 thereafter it was reported that within the first week of life the full-term neo- natal gut microbiome is largely colonized by actinobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes and much less firmicutes phyla.165166 oversterilizations of our environment a lower incidence of disease as well as changes to diet have resulted in lowered exposure to pathogens and antigens and have led to a change in the communities of friendly bacteria that live inside humans.

the microbiota has also been shown to provide protection from many chronic diseases of the gut and they truly deserve the nickname of friendly bacteria.disclosurethe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.referenceslederberg j mccray at webpage on the internet.

the bacterium that predominated in all categories waslongum.92 synergy 1 is made from inulin from the chicory plant and oligofructose.67 another important bacterium is faecalibacterium prausnitzii which is found in ample quantity 5 of the total bacterial population in the human intestinal microbiota of healthy adults.93 this species is a highly function- ally active member of the microbiome influencing numerous host pathways.94 several intestinal disorders were noticed to contain low numbers of f. prausnitzii particularly in ibd patients.9395 hence the number of intestinal f. prausnitzii can be recommended as an indicator of intestinal health.93-95 immu- nologic dysregulation is the reason of numerous noninfectious human illnesses.

the three principal scfas found in the human body are butyrate propionate and acetate in an approximate ratio of 113.49 approxi- mately 95-99 the clear majority of scfas produced in the gut are absorbed.50 scfas predominantly butyrate are vital sources of energy for colonocytes and up to 70 of their energy needs may be gained through fermentation.41 it has been shown in mice that a lack of a microbiome and therefore no production of butyrate can lead to autophagy self-digestion of cells in response to an energy and nutri- ent deficit of the colon cells.95152 the colonocytes of these germ-free mice were also found to be energy-deficient as well as having reduced levels of enzymes that catalyze reactions such as those in the citric acid cycle.51 this highlights the importance of a microbiome and the substantial contribution they make to energy supply.

this evidence points to protein breakdown and the production of toxic by-products as potential causes of diseases in the distal large gut.41modulation of the microbiomeas it is well established that a healthy gut microbiome has many positive effects on their human hosts and has influ- ence on diseases thoughts have turned to how to change and enhance the microbiome to gain further health benefits.prebioticsa prebiotic is defined as a nonviable food component that confers a health benefit on the host associated with themodulation of the microbiota.6263 although most foodstuff will change the levels of bacteria in the gut64 nonviable food ingredients such as inulin fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides have a more specific effect on the growth of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.65 both are gram-positive anaerobes which are specialized in the breakdown of carbohydrates in the gut.66 as mentioned above carbohydrate digestion produces scfas which is beneficial to the gut.

these are all known to disturb the gut microbiome therefore it is hypothesized that this disruption to the bacteria is key to the pathogenesis of ibs.161 investigations have shown that the composition of the microbiome in ibs patients differs from the norm with a higher presence of facultatively anaerobic microorgan- isms such as streptococcus spp.

many studies have been conducted but the results are yet being not conclusive but it shows some promise.bacteria in the body over timeneonatesthe gut microbiome and principally the study of its ances- tries in neonates have become subtopics of great curiosity within the arena of genomics.162 the human body does not develop a microbiome until after birth the sterile nature of the womb prevents microbial colonization until birth.
