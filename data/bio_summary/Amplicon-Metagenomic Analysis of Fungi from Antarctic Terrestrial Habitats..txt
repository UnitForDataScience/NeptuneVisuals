Furthermore new genes from Antarctica have been found through metagenomic and functional analysis such as a new cytosolic esterase from the ab hydrolase family 6   a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene which was proposed as a novel reporter gene for promoter trapping    bacterial hydrocarbon-degrading genes   genes encoding proteins that functionally respond to environmental stress such as exopolysaccharides cold shock proteins and membrane modifications   and genes encoding enzymes with potential in industrial applications such as lipaseesterase amylase protease and cellulase   .The microfungal diversity in the terrestrial habitats of eight islands of the South Shetland Archipelago two islands located on the Antarctic Peninsula and from Union Glacier was studied in this work through amplicon-metagenome analysis.
