Currently there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of IBS.5 Diagnosis is difficult because there are no reliable or standardized biomarkers and because the pathology cannot be detected with radiological or endoscopic tests.6 Patients with IBS are further subtyped using the Bristol Stool Form Scale BSFS according to their predominant stool pattern constipation-predominant IBS-C or diarrhoea-pre- dominant IBS-D mixed or unsubtypedunclassified ie insufficient abnormality of stool consistency to meet criteria for the other IBS subtypes.7 Patients with alarming features should undergo colonoscopy to rule out organic disease and random biopsies should be obtained to test for microscopic colitis in patients with IBS-D.8Patients with IBS have an average duration of disease of 10 or more years.9 Irritable bowel syndrome is often undiagnosedor untreated with as few as 25 of IBS sufferers seeking pro- fessional health care.10 Those seeking care are often frustrated by the lack of results of traditional treatment and management strategies.

A retrospective study64 showed that of the 23 patients who returned for visit within 4 to 5 months 19 82.6 P  .01 had negative glucose breath test results vs baseline.A recent retrospective study investigated the association between rifaximin therapy and LHBT changes in nonconsti- pated patients with IBS who showed normalized LHBT values after treatment.65 Patients with IBS symptoms and similar LHBT values prior to therapy received rifaximin 1200 mg daily for treatment periods of 4 8 or 12 weeks.

One meta-analysis showed that alosetron positively affected global symptoms pain and discomfort in nonconstipated female patients with IBS.23 However 1 in 4 patients treated with alosetron may develop constipation and its more serious complications such as ischaemic colitis.24 The efficacy of alosetron is unclear in male patients.23 Antidepressant therapy especially tricyclic antidepressants has generally proven effective to some degree.25 In terms of psychological treatment options such as cognitive behavioural therapy mindfulness gut-directed hypnotherapy and psychodynamic therapy the evidence supporting their use in patients with IBS is strong but their availability limits their use in clinical practice.26Rifaximin a minimally absorbed antibiotic is the latest drug to be approved by the FDA it was approved in May 201527 after it showed promising results in 2 large-scale randomized trials.2829 It is an oral wide-spectrum long-acting GI-specific antibiotic that has no clinically relevant bacterial resistance.3031 Therefore rifaximin may be useful in the treatment of GI dis- orders associated with altered bacterial flora including IBS and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO.In the following sections we will evaluate the clinical poten- tial of this drug.

In addition rifaximin has proven to be very effective against the cultures obtained from patients with SIBO affects the inflammatory environ- ment in patients having a multitude of intestinal diseases and eliminates the toxins produced by bacteria eg lipid metabo- lism end products.6869 With these mechanisms backed by the results of a number of credible randomized studies demon- strating its favourable efficacy and safety profile rifaximin is the latest drug to be approved by FDA for treatment of IBS-D. As it has been observed that the patients do not relapse long after treatment it is safe to suggest that the pathology of IBS in these patients has been treated.

Nonpharmacologic interventions which may improve symp- toms include exercise stress reduction and treating coexisting sleep disorders.11 Most of the patients with IBS believe that certain food items are important triggers of the GI symptoms and self-address their dietary concerns.13Diarrhoea-predominant IBS is the most common subtypes occurring in approximately 40 of patients.14 The most com- monly used over-the-counter treatments include prebiotics and antidiarrhoeals such as loperamide.

Probiotics are effective treatments for IBS although which individual species and strains are the most beneficial remains unclear.15-17 Loperamide generally improves the symptoms of diarrhoea such as stool consistency and borborygmi although it provides no significantCreative Commons Non Commercial CC BY-NC This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial4.0 License which permits non-commercial use reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages httpsus.sagepub.comen-usnamopen-access-at-sage.improvement in global IBS symptoms compared with placebo and it does not improve abdominal pain or distension.18 Regarding antispasmodics a recent Cochrane review concluded that although there is weak evidence of the benefit for abdomi- nal pain and global symptom relief it is unclear whether indi- vidual antispasmodic classes are effective.19 In addition in higher doses antispasmodics have anticholinergic-like effects.

It is generally defined as the presence of 105 bacte- riamL of upper GI aspiration.37 However this definition is generally relaxed for the consideration of SIBO in IBS stud- ies.38 Several studies have shown a definite relationship between IBS and SIBO.

In IBS it not only increased the number of bacteria in the gut but also the bacterial composition that is implicated in the disease.39Technique used to diagnose SIBOThe role of SIBO in IBS depends on the mode of testing for SIBO.
