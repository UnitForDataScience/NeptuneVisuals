currently there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of ibs.5 diagnosis is difficult because there are no reliable or standardized biomarkers and because the pathology cannot be detected with radiological or endoscopic tests.6 patients with ibs are further subtyped using the bristol stool form scale bsfs according to their predominant stool pattern constipation-predominant ibs-c or diarrhoea-pre- dominant ibs-d mixed or unsubtypedunclassified ie insufficient abnormality of stool consistency to meet criteria for the other ibs subtypes.7 patients with alarming features should undergo colonoscopy to rule out organic disease and random biopsies should be obtained to test for microscopic colitis in patients with ibs-d.8patients with ibs have an average duration of disease of 10 or more years.9 irritable bowel syndrome is often undiagnosedor untreated with as few as 25 of ibs sufferers seeking pro- fessional health care.10 those seeking care are often frustrated by the lack of results of traditional treatment and management strategies.

these factors support the use of a min-imally absorbable antibiotic for the treatment of ibs-d.pathogenesis of sibo in ibsthe pathophysiology of ibs includes infection and immune activation serotonin dysregulation central dysregulation and dysfunction of the brain-gut interaction genetic predisposi- tion and bacterial overgrowth.12table 1. significant clinical trials involving rifaximin.abbreviations ibs irritable bowel syndrome ibs-d diarrhoea-predominant ibs lhbt lactose hydrogen breath test.a plethora of vital functions are performed by the intestinal bacteria.

nonpharmacologic interventions which may improve symp- toms include exercise stress reduction and treating coexisting sleep disorders.11 most of the patients with ibs believe that certain food items are important triggers of the gi symptoms and self-address their dietary concerns.13diarrhoea-predominant ibs is the most common subtypes occurring in approximately 40 of patients.14 the most com- monly used over-the-counter treatments include prebiotics and antidiarrhoeals such as loperamide.

probiotics are effective treatments for ibs although which individual species and strains are the most beneficial remains unclear.15-17 loperamide generally improves the symptoms of diarrhoea such as stool consistency and borborygmi although it provides no significantcreative commons non commercial cc by-nc this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noncommercial4.0 license which permits non-commercial use reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the sage and open access pages httpsus.sagepub.comen-usnamopen-access-at-sage.improvement in global ibs symptoms compared with placebo and it does not improve abdominal pain or distension.18 regarding antispasmodics a recent cochrane review concluded that although there is weak evidence of the benefit for abdomi- nal pain and global symptom relief it is unclear whether indi- vidual antispasmodic classes are effective.19 in addition in higher doses antispasmodics have anticholinergic-like effects.

one meta-analysis showed that alosetron positively affected global symptoms pain and discomfort in nonconstipated female patients with ibs.23 however 1 in 4 patients treated with alosetron may develop constipation and its more serious complications such as ischaemic colitis.24 the efficacy of alosetron is unclear in male patients.23 antidepressant therapy especially tricyclic antidepressants has generally proven effective to some degree.25 in terms of psychological treatment options such as cognitive behavioural therapy mindfulness gut-directed hypnotherapy and psychodynamic therapy the evidence supporting their use in patients with ibs is strong but their availability limits their use in clinical practice.26rifaximin a minimally absorbed antibiotic is the latest drug to be approved by the fda it was approved in may 201527 after it showed promising results in 2 large-scale randomized trials.2829 it is an oral wide-spectrum long-acting gi-specific antibiotic that has no clinically relevant bacterial resistance.3031 therefore rifaximin may be useful in the treatment of gi dis- orders associated with altered bacterial flora including ibs and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo.in the following sections we will evaluate the clinical poten- tial of this drug.

it is generally defined as the presence of 105 bacte- riaml of upper gi aspiration.37 however this definition is generally relaxed for the consideration of sibo in ibs stud- ies.38 several studies have shown a definite relationship between ibs and sibo.

in ibs it not only increased the number of bacteria in the gut but also the bacterial composition that is implicated in the disease.39technique used to diagnose sibothe role of sibo in ibs depends on the mode of testing for sibo.

although the reported range varies breath testing has been found to be abnormal in patients with ibs.4243 in one study 68 of 93 patients who had a positive breath test were found to have ibs-d 73.43 in a meta-analysis of 11 studies breath testing was found to be abnormal more often among ibs subjects than healthy controls odds ratio  4.46.44 breath test results normalize in patients with the use of antibi- otics.42 although the lactose breath test lbt or lactose hydrogen breath test lhbt is often used data show that their diagnostic accuracy is inferior to that of glucose breath testing gbt 55.1 vs 71.7 suggesting a need to switch to the more accurate gbt in future clinical trials assessing bacterial overgrowth in patients with ibs.45when duodenal aspirate cultures collected using upper gi endoscopy were studied it was concluded that sibo of aerobic bacteria is independently linked with ibs.

this was more com- mon in cases of ibs-d 60 than in other types 27.3.46 a recent study disapproved the hypothesis that bacterial overgrowth in patients with ibs was caused using proton pump inhibitors.47 the newest method for studying the intestinal microbiota is isolating and analysing the 16s profile of the genetic material ie dna from the duodenal material of patients with ibs-d and controls.46 such studies have confirmed the presence of microbial overgrowth in the small bowel in ibs with a con- comitant reduction in bacterial diversity.
