Cao.1 First author.2 Equally contributing author.a b s t r a c t For the development of disease prevention and intervention strategies a better understanding of the dynamics and interactions within cervical bacterial communities in both healthy cows and cows with metritis is required.

To gain deeper insight into fluctuations within the cervical microbiota swab samples were collected from 40 Holstein dairy cows and16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to analyze cervical bacterial diversity.

The superior certain side of the external cervical os was smeared with the sampler thoroughly then samples were then placed in a nitrogen canister for trans-portation back to the laboratory lag time of approximately 4 h and stored at -80 oC until used.Total bacterial genomic DNA extractionTotal genomic DNA was extracted from cervical swabs using TIANamp Bacteria DNA Kits Tiangen Technology.

However the number of OTUs in the metritis group was only 265 indicating a comparatively simple cervical microbial community.Concomitant with an increase in sample size species accumu- lation curves gradually slowed after a certain range indicating that our rarified sequencing depth was sufficient to evaluate the di- versity of cervical bacterial communities in cows .The calculated ACE index  demonstrates the complexity of the bacterial species within groups.

In other words the composition of cervical mi- crobial communities was more complex in formative cows than in gestating and postpartum cows.Recent studies have suggested that the diversity of cervical bacterial composition in dairy cows is likely to be even more complex than previously described by traditional culture- dependent methods .

However our 16SrDNA sequencing results showed that the cervical bacterial community in the formative gestational and postpartum stages of cows was composed of mainly Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Bac- teroidetes while cows with metritis had a cervical bacterial com- munity composed of mainly Bacteroidetes Fusobacteria andFirmicutes.

These results provide a reference to evaluate the cervical microbial community in the formative gestational and postpartum stages of cows as well as in cows with metritis thus enabling large- scale cohort studies of the cervical ecosystem.

The results revealed a complex profile with extensive differences in the cervical bacterial composition.

At the phylum level the cervical microbial community in the CF CG and CP groups included mainly Firmicutes which accounted for 39.3 48.3 and 49.6 of the total microbial composition of each group respectively.

However the cervical bacterial community in the CM group consisted of mostly Bacteroidetes which accounted for 72.6 of the total microbial composi- tion.
