Asthma during pregnancy often leads to maternal antibiotic treatment and delivery by caesarean interventions that can interrupt the transfer of maternal lactobacilli which become more prominent in the placenta gut and vaginal tract in the last trimester of pregnancy - Reduced abundance of Lactobacillales has been observed in the meconium of newborns of mothers with atopic disease Female infants are generally born smaller than male infants however in response to maternal asthma the Caucasian male fetus is more likely to have a lower birthweight and show growth retardation when delivered at term than the female fetus MARTIN et al.

Prenatal maternal asthma was not differentially distributed by infant sex or ethnicity birth mode early term birth birthweight breastfeeding status maternal pre-pregnancy weight and maternal intrapartum antibiotic treatment 1 it tended to be higher in both the lowest and highest infant weight gain tertiles.

On the other hand while the pregnancy questionnaire included criteria which had been validated as measures of prenatal asthma morbidity maternal asthma status during pregnancy was not verified by a physician neither did we test asthma severity which might explain the modest impact of maternal asthma on birthweight .Both prenatal and postnatal exposures are potential stimuli for health programming in the infant through the modification of intestinal microbiota Initial colonisation of the neonatal gut plays a central role in the development of the immune system Our results provide the first evidence of a programming effect of prenatal maternal asthma on gut microbial composition that is independent of birth and postnatal events.

Similar differences in infant gut microbial composition according to maternal prenatal asthma status were also more evident among women with food or environmental allergies.Gut lactobacilli were less abundant in male infants but Bacteroidaceae were more abundant in female infants at 3-4 months of age following maternal asthma during pregnancy.This article has supplementary material available from erj.ersjournals.com Received Feb 08 2017  Accepted after revision Aug 16 2017Support statement The Canadian Institutes of Health Research CIHR and the Allergy Genes and Environment AllerGen Network of Centres of Excellence provided core support for the CHILD study.

Second we sought evidence for a fetal programming role of maternal asthma that was independent of birth mode and related events and was enhanced by maternal comorbid conditions such as overweight and atopic disease.Material and methodsStudy design and sample collectionThis study was conducted on 1021 mothers and their infants who participated in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development CHILD Study - a national population-based birth cohort - Pregnant women were recruited in their second or third trimester at the Manitoba Edmonton Alberta and Vancouver Ontario sites of the CHILD cohort.

To determine the impact of maternal comorbid conditions statistical testing was also performed following stratification by maternal prenatal atopy status and pre-pregnancy weight normal weight 24.9 overweight 25.0 body mass index.

P restricted to Caucasian vaginally delivered breastfed infants not exposed to maternal antibiotics during birth  comparison of Lactobacillus was the primary hypothesis.Adjustment for covariates in multi-variable regression showed the association between prenatal maternal asthma and gut lactobacilli in offspring to be quite robust 5.

Independent of maternal atopy status and pre-pregnancy weight birth mode intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis breastfeeding status and sex infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy were one-third as likely to have Lactobacillus abundance in the highest tertile at 3-4 months of age.

While no prior evidence exists for maternal prenatal asthma these findings are compatible with the reduced Lactobacillales abundance observed in the meconium of newborns of mothers with eczema and lower faecal colonisation with Lactobacillus species in infants of atopic parents In our study male infants born to mothers with prenatal asthma were one-third aOR 0.26 95 CI 0.07-0.89 as likely to be colonised with high levels of lactobacilli independent of maternal overweight or atopy status birth mode or infant diet.
