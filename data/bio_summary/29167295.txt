p restricted to caucasian vaginally delivered breastfed infants not exposed to maternal antibiotics during birth  comparison of lactobacillus was the primary hypothesis.adjustment for covariates in multi-variable regression showed the association between prenatal maternal asthma and gut lactobacilli in offspring to be quite robust 5. independent of maternal atopy status and pre-pregnancy weight birth mode intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis breastfeeding status and sex infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy were one-third as likely to have lactobacillus abundance in the highest tertile at 3-4 months of age.

these associations were not present in female offspring.male infants are at higher risk of developing wheeze during infancy than female infants especially if they are caucasian although sex differences in gut microbiota composition have not been a focus of attention until recently literature reporting a higher risk for overweight with antibiotic use in maleasthmatic normala sunclactinomyces b gactinomycesc factinomycetaceae d sunclgemellaceae e gunclgemellaceae f fgemellaceaeg suncllactobacillus h suncllactococcus i glactococcusj sunclmegamonas k gmegamonasl othertrabulsiella m gtrabulsiellaasthmatic normala sfragilisb gbacteroidesc fbacteroidaceae d othercloistridiume sunclmegasphaera f gmegasphaerag sunclpseudomonas h gpseudomonasi fpseudomonas4433221100-1-1-2-2-3-3-4-4-5figure 1 cladogram and linear discriminant analysis lda plots for prenatal maternal atopic asthma by a male and b female caucasian infants from lda effect size lefse methods.but not female infants suggests differential sensitivity of male gut microbiota to environmental perturbations in their australian caucasian cohort clifton et al.

crude differences in median and high abundance were found for gut colonisation by members of the genus lactobacillus according to infant feeding and asthma status of the mother 1.the abundance of lactobacillus was significantly lower among infants born to women with non-caucasian ethnicity and to women with asthma during pregnancy 1. based on the art test the p-value for the interaction term between prenatal asthma and caucasian ethnicity was 0.002. in caucasian infants prenatal maternal asthma was significantly associated with a lower relative abundance of the genus lactobacillus median 0.001 versus 0.002 p0.01 2. this genus was not differentially abundant by maternal asthma status in non-caucasian infants data not shown.

asthma during pregnancy often leads to maternal antibiotic treatment and delivery by caesarean interventions that can interrupt the transfer of maternal lactobacilli which become more prominent in the placenta gut and vaginal tract in the last trimester of pregnancy - reduced abundance of lactobacillales has been observed in the meconium of newborns of mothers with atopic disease female infants are generally born smaller than male infants however in response to maternal asthma the caucasian male fetus is more likely to have a lower birthweight and show growth retardation when delivered at term than the female fetus martin et al.

similar differences in infant gut microbial composition according to maternal prenatal asthma status were also more evident among women with food or environmental allergies.gut lactobacilli were less abundant in male infants but bacteroidaceae were more abundant in female infants at 3-4 months of age following maternal asthma during pregnancy.this article has supplementary material available from erj.ersjournals.com received feb 08 2017  accepted after revision aug 16 2017support statement the canadian institutes of health research cihr and the allergy genes and environment allergen network of centres of excellence provided core support for the child study.

while no prior evidence exists for maternal prenatal asthma these findings are compatible with the reduced lactobacillales abundance observed in the meconium of newborns of mothers with eczema and lower faecal colonisation with lactobacillus species in infants of atopic parents in our study male infants born to mothers with prenatal asthma were one-third aor 0.26 95 ci 0.07-0.89 as likely to be colonised with high levels of lactobacilli independent of maternal overweight or atopy status birth mode or infant diet.

restriction to caucasian ethnicity also allowed us to test associations within a population at highest risk for infant wheeze male caucasian infants to test the a priori research question on infant sex and adjust for putative confounding factors analyses were stratified by infant sex birth mode breastfeeding status and intrapartum antibiotic exposure also a strong marker for infant antibiotic use using the adjusted rank transform art nonparametric test for interaction the p-value for the interaction between infant sex and maternal prenatal asthma on lactobacillus abundance was 0.001. to determine the impact of maternal comorbid conditions statistical testing was also performed following stratification by maternal prenatal atopy status and pre-pregnancy weight normal weight 24.9 overweight 25.0 body mass index.

microbiota in female infants tended to be enhanced with bacteroidetes median relative abundance 20.8 versus 9.3. with the exception of firmicutes being less abundant in female infants born to women with asthma  p0.03 no other differences were evident in phylum abundance microbial richness or diversity between infants born to women with versus those without prenatal asthma supplementary figure s1 supplementary table s1.

to identify discriminative taxonomic biomarkers the linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was conducted with a linear discriminant analysis lda log score cut-off of 2 followed by the kruskal-wallis test with the dunn's multiple comparison test using no prenatal maternal asthma as the reference group.results9 of the infants under study were born to women with asthma during pregnancy the majority by vaginal delivery 8 of these infants were born by emergency caesarean and 7 by elective caesarean.

following prenatal asthma the gut of female caucasian infants born vaginally and breastfed without exposure to maternal intrapartum antibiotics was more abundant in members of theall infants with caucasian mothersno asthmaasthmacrude p-valuedata are presented as median interquartile range unless otherwise stated.

other high-risk cohort studies have found discordant faecal microbial biomarkers for atopic disease such aslower abundance of bacteroidetes or ruminococcaceae or higher abundance of the clostridium cluster but these observations were evident either at a much younger or older infant age furthermore sex-specific findings were not reported in these studies .maternal overweight during pregnancy has been linked to a higher risk of asthma and other atopic diseases in offspring in our study infants maternal asthma comorbidity with this added risk for offspring also yielded a reduction in the abundance of faecal megasphaera in female infants and an elevation in the abundance of bacteroidaceae.

of interest in the same cohort of infants we found that a lower ratio of the faecal abundance of enterobactericeae to bacteroidaceae protected against food sensitisation hence our findings suggest a programming role for maternal asthma in shaping early gut colonisation which cannot be attributed to caesarean delivery antibiotic use or formula feeding and which differs by sex and might confer less immediate risk for allergy in female infants there are several strengths to our research.

our findings were based on a large population-based cohort of full-term infants that included early-term infants who are more likely to be delivered by asthmatic women and develop asthma the large sample size also afforded stratification by covariates to identify associations between microbiota and maternal asthma which were independent of birth-related events .

second we sought evidence for a fetal programming role of maternal asthma that was independent of birth mode and related events and was enhanced by maternal comorbid conditions such as overweight and atopic disease.material and methodsstudy design and sample collectionthis study was conducted on 1021 mothers and their infants who participated in the canadian healthy infant longitudinal development child study - a national population-based birth cohort - pregnant women were recruited in their second or third trimester at the manitoba edmonton alberta and vancouver ontario sites of the child cohort.

the megasphaera species utilise lactate as a substrate to produce propionate whereas bacteroides species produce propionate when lactate levels are low propionate is absorbed by the host for liver gluconeogenesis possesses anti-inflammatory and satiety properties and protects against the development of allergic asthma in a murine model lactobacillus bacteria are available to the newborn during vaginal delivery and breastfeeding and are sensitive to antibiotic treatment caesarean delivery and formula feeding have the potential to diminish maternal transfer of lactobacilli and other microbes to the infant yet the reduction in lactobacillus abundance was also evident in male infants who were breastfed following vaginal delivery without maternal antibiotics although statistical significance was lost after the reduction in sample size.
