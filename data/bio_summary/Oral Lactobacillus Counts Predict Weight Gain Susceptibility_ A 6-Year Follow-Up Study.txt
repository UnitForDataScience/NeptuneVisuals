The largest proportion 38.8 n  125 of the subjects had an oral Lactobacillus count of 103 colonies while 67 20.8 subjects had a count of 106 oral Lactobacillus colonies.Cross-sectional associations between BMI at baseline and counts of Lactobacillus colonies were neither significant before p  0.54 nor after adjusting for relevant covariates such as sex age socioeconomic position alcohol smoking complex carbohydrate intake sugar intake and energy intake p  0.28 data not shown.An overall inverse association was found between counts of oral Lactobacillus and subse- quent 6-year change in BMI p  0.03 before adjusting for covariates 103 b  0 104 b  0.13 95 CI -0.40 0.65  105 b  -0.09 95 CI -0.64 0.44  106 b  -0.70 95 CI -1.23 -0.18data not shown.

In support of our findings most species of Lactobacillus in the oral cavity belong to the L. casei group 18.The inverse association between oral Lactobacillus and weight change remained similar before and after adjusting for numerous covariates including sugar intake alcohol intake and smoking which in other studies have been found to influence both oral and intestinal Lactobacillus count as well as risk of obesity 19 20 21.

To examine if there was an association between dietary carbohydrates and oral bacteria subjects agreed to give saliva and have their oral Lactobacillus cultivated.The three health examinations included measurements of height and weight and questionnaires on life- style including socioeconomic positioning smoking and alcohol consumption.The project was approved by the Ethics Committee for Copenhagen County and is in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983.Anthropometric MeasurementsAll anthropometric measurements were made in accordance with the WHO standards.

The adjusted analyses however revealed significant interactions between counts of oral Lactobacillus colonies and complex carbohydrate intake p for interaction  0.04.The associations between the counts of oral Lactobacillus and the subsequent 6-year change in BMI by levels of carbohydrate intake are shown in figure 1.

The adjusted analysis also revealed a significant interaction p  0.03 between counts of oral Lactobacillus colonies and total energy intake.We performed specific sensitivity analyses to examine confounding from sugar intake and smoking included as both a continuous and a categorical variable but all results were essentially similar before and after inclusion of these variables data not shown.Also none of the other covariates including the indicator variable whether participants had developed gallstones or additional variables on active caries dental hygiene or antibi- otics use in the past 5 years were found to influence the association between Lactobacillus and 6-year weight gain data not shown and none of these variables were consequently included in the final model except for BMI at baseline.DiscussionThe present study proposes oral Lactobacillus counts as a novel biomarker for weight gain susceptibility in people with low and medium intake of complex carbohydrates.

We found that high oral Lactobacillus count predicted weight loss if the intake of complex carbo- hydrates was low while at medium intake of complex carbohydrates high oral Lactobacillus count 106 predicted weight maintenance.

There was no association between oral Lactoba- cillus and 6-year changes in BMI in subjects with high intakes of complex carbohydrates.The mechanism behind our observations remains elusive but alterations in the gut microbiota are a possible confounding cause giving the proposed interrelationship between the oral and gut microbiome 11.

The finding that oral Lactobacillus counts were unrelated to weight devel- opment in subjects with high intake of complex carbohydrates supports the previously reported observation of L. casei dominating the oral cavity 18.

Aim We examined the association between the level of oral Lactobacillus and the subsequent 6-year weight change in a healthy population of 322 Danish adults aged 35-65 years at base- line.

Results In unadjusted analysis the level of oral Lactobacillus was inversely associated with subsequent 6-year change in BMI.
