Further perturbation of phenylalanine metabolism to tyrosine was observed during CSFV infection but the tyrosine derivative dopamine was unexpectedly increased.Equol the gut bacteria-regulated metabolite from daidzein was observed to be elevated at dpi 3 and decreased at dpi7 following infection Table 1 a change that may further reflect the perturbation of the gut microbiota induced by CSFV infection.

In addition Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  was used to identify the altered metabolic pathways in piglets following CSFV infection.RESULTSClinical Presentations of Piglets Infected with CSFVAfter infection with CSFV virulent Shimen strain viremia was detected at low level 105.0 genome copiesml in piglets at dpi 3 and reached high level at about 109.0 genome copiesml at dpi 7 Figure 1A.

Taken together altered levels of aromatic amino acids and otherdifferential metabolites in the serum of infected piglets may provide an indication of intestinal dysbiosis induced by CSFV infection which will be confirmed in future studies.In summary we have analyzed the serum metabolomics of CSFV-infected piglets and shown that changes in the levels of certain metabolites can separate infected animals from healthy ones.

Phenylalanine derivatives including phenylacetylglycineTABLE 1  Differential metabolites in CSFV-infected piglets compared to healthy controls.VIP Variable Importance in the Projection FC fold change SM piglets infected with CSFV Shimen strain dpi day post infection.FIGURE 3  Heat map of differentially expressed metabolites in piglets infected with CSFV.

Likewise a metabolite in another tryptophan metabolism pathway serotonin was significantly decreased during infection Table 1.Phenylalanine metabolism was also changed by infection.

Although inosine was found to be elevated only in the early stages of CSFV infection its derivatives uric acid and allantoin were significantly up-regulated throughout.In addition to the alterations in nucleotide metabolism nitrogen homeostasis was also perturbed during infection as evidenced by the decreased levels of citrulline and ornithine and the elevation of urea.

Another energy pathway for acetyl-CoA production fatty acid b-oxidation was also suppressed immediately following CSFV infection as evidenced by the substantial accumulation of long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids carnitine and acylcarnitines.In addition elevated levels of long chain fatty acids suggest that CSFV infection promotes fatty acid biosynthesis which may in turn facilitate the formation of membranous viral replication complexes and promote viral propagation.

To reveal metabolic changes occurring following infection the unsupervised method primary component analysis PCA was utilized to provide an overview of systemic variations and general clustering among all groups and the supervised method partial least- square discriminant analysis PLS-DA was utilized to identify differential metabolites accounting for the separation betweengroups of piglets.

Of note is that one of the infected piglets did not show any clinical signs until dpi 8 while serum samples collected at dpi 3 and 7 from this animal were included in the metabolomic analysis.Metabolomic Analysis of Serum MetabolitesSerum metabolomic profiles following CSFV infection were characterized using UPLCESI-Q-TOFMS and PCA and PLS- DA were applied to the data.

Intermediates including citric succinic fumaric and malic acids decreased as the infection developed except for an up-regulation of oxaloacetate in the late stages Figure 4 indicating the blocking of energy production in CSFV infected piglets.
