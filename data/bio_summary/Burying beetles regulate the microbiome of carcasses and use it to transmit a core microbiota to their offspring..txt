However little is known about their role in regulating carcass microbiota micro- bial community dynamics over stages of carcass burial and prepa- ration and the relative contribution of the beetles the original carcass microbiota and that of the surrounding soil in determining carcass microbial assemblages.

At this time beetles begin removal of hair from the carcass and nibble at the carcass possi- bly eating the carcass and applying oral secretions and smearing the carcass with anal secretions Pukowski 1933.

Given their prevalence in meat either fresh or decomposing and in the gut of flesh-feeding insects and their diverse digestive and antimicrobial properties these bacteria could play important roles in carcass diges- tion and preservation.Total bacterial and fungal gene copy numbers increased subse- quent to carcass preparation by the beetles indicating that utiliza- tion of carcasses by the burying beetles is accompanied by an increase in fungal and bacterial gene copy numbers rather thanab0-2-4-6-8-100-2-4-6-8-10-12Carcasses without beetlesBeetle-prepared carcassesCarcasses without beetlesBeetle-prepared carcasses86420Carcasses without beetlesBeetle-prepared carcassesCarcasses without beetlesBeetle-prepared carcassesFI GU RE 5 Quantitative PCR analyses estimating a relative proportion of 16S DNA copy numbers belonging to Vagococcus Wohlfahrtiimonas Providencia Morganella and b ITS gene copy numbers belonging to Candida and Yarrowia in decomposing carcasses that had no exposure to beetles versus beetle-prepared carcasses of a similar age.

DNA extractionAll carcass stages were sampled homogenously using sterile DNA-free swabs swabbing with equal intensity while gentlyrotating the swab for approximately 10 s over the carcass sur- face or inside the carcass cavity created by breeding beetles.

The beetles carry a characteristic and diverse hindgut bacterial community which is consistent across Sil- phidae beetles Kaltenpoth  Steiger 2014 which is transmitted by the beetles to the carcass through the anal and oral secretions.

Despite such an advantage we find that stage 3 carcass communities were highly dissimilar to stage 1 bacterial communities and thus beetle-introduced micro- organisms outcompeted those that were already present on the carcass surface.These data indicate that apart from being a source of nutrition for the larvae the carcass could also act as a medium fortransmission of mutualistic micro-organisms from parent to offspring Figure 3.

We show that the beetles inoculate and regu- late the carcass microbiota resulting in a characteristic community composition on the carcass.

Shifts in carcass microbiota during breedingFor characterization of the carcass microbiota we sampled the same carcasses at three distinct stages timepoints Figure 1 using a fresh set of sexually mature beetles.

The bacterial communities of both the feeding cavities and nonfeeding regions of Stage 3 carcasses had greater similarity with the beetles' anal and oral secretions than to the original carcass bacterial commu- nity untreated carcass or the surrounding soil Figure 2b.
