2017 wang  rozen 2017. however little is known about their role in regulating carcass microbiota micro- bial community dynamics over stages of carcass burial and prepa- ration and the relative contribution of the beetles the original carcass microbiota and that of the surrounding soil in determining carcass microbial assemblages.

2017. using a culture-based approach wang and rozen 2017 demonstrated vertical transmission of the maternal gut community to the larvae via the carcass surface whereas in the absence of parental care the larvae primarily acquired microbesthat are native to the carcass wang  rozen 2017. however this culture-dependent aerobic characterization excluded anaero- bic and uncultivable bacteria as well as fungal associates of the beetles although yarrowia-like yeasts are highly abundant and consistently present in burying beetles kaltenpoth  steiger 2014. application of parental anal secretions to the carcass and transferring oral secretions to larvae are important mechanisms through which n. vespilloides may transmit microbiota to their off- spring vogel et al.

given their prevalence in meat either fresh or decomposing and in the gut of flesh-feeding insects and their diverse digestive and antimicrobial properties these bacteria could play important roles in carcass diges- tion and preservation.total bacterial and fungal gene copy numbers increased subse- quent to carcass preparation by the beetles indicating that utiliza- tion of carcasses by the burying beetles is accompanied by an increase in fungal and bacterial gene copy numbers rather thanab0-2-4-6-8-100-2-4-6-8-10-12carcasses without beetlesbeetle-prepared carcassescarcasses without beetlesbeetle-prepared carcasses86420carcasses without beetlesbeetle-prepared carcassescarcasses without beetlesbeetle-prepared carcassesfi gu re 5 quantitative pcr analyses estimating a relative proportion of 16s dna copy numbers belonging to vagococcus wohlfahrtiimonas providencia morganella and b its gene copy numbers belonging to candida and yarrowia in decomposing carcasses that had no exposure to beetles versus beetle-prepared carcasses of a similar age.

despite such an advantage we find that stage 3 carcass communities were highly dissimilar to stage 1 bacterial communities and thus beetle-introduced micro- organisms outcompeted those that were already present on the carcass surface.these data indicate that apart from being a source of nutrition for the larvae the carcass could also act as a medium fortransmission of mutualistic micro-organisms from parent to offspring figure 3. although beetle-prepared carcasses hosted a yeast-domi- nant fungal community only the yarrowia-like yeasts were consis- tently present in the beetle life stages their secretions and the carcass surface.

dna extractionall carcass stages were sampled homogenously using sterile dna-free swabs swabbing with equal intensity while gentlyrotating the swab for approximately 10 s over the carcass sur- face or inside the carcass cavity created by breeding beetles.

the beetles carry a characteristic and diverse hindgut bacterial community which is consistent across sil- phidae beetles kaltenpoth  steiger 2014 which is transmitted by the beetles to the carcass through the anal and oral secretions.

we show that the beetles inoculate and regu- late the carcass microbiota resulting in a characteristic community composition on the carcass.

shifts in carcass microbiota during breedingfor characterization of the carcass microbiota we sampled the same carcasses at three distinct stages timepoints figure 1 using a fresh set of sexually mature beetles.

the bacterial communities of both the feeding cavities and nonfeeding regions of stage 3 carcasses had greater similarity with the beetles' anal and oral secretions than to the original carcass bacterial commu- nity untreated carcass or the surrounding soil figure 2b.

of these otus assigned to wohlfahrtiimonas vagococcus providencia and morganella were also present in adult guts andor their anal and oral secretions and in the feeding cavity of the carcass surface but were not consistently present in untreated carcasses or soil figure 3.bacterial abundance increased significantly after beetles initiated carcass preparation figure 4a with 16s rrna gene copy numbers increasing by about three orders of magnitude from untreated to trea- ted carcasses and remaining the same between stage 2 and stage 3 carcasses feeding and nonfeeding regions.

otus assigned to wohlfahrtiimonas providencia morganella and vagococcus were consistently present in larvae and were also detected in beetles and their secretions but were not consistently present in untreated carcass stages or soil indicating a parent to offspring transmission of the core microbiota via the carcass surface through the anal and oral secretionsin the negative control indicating that these taxa are most likely pre- sent only in beetle-utilized carcasses.

2017 identified extracellular antimicrobial peptides amps such as defensins thaumatins atta- cins and lysozymes c-type and i-type lysozymes that showed dif- ferential expression in the gut regions likely contributing to the composition of anal and oral secretions that may in turn regulate the microbiota of the gut and the carcass.the hindgut microbiota of burying beetles is characterized bya species-rich and characteristic bacterial and fungal community that is consistent across the subfamily nicrophorinae and possibly aids in carrion digestion detoxification or preservation kaltenpoth  steiger 2014. the bacterial community is dominated by mem- bers of xanthomonadaceae enterobacteriaceae clostridiales and enterococcaceae which clusters according to host geographic dis- tribution suggesting occasional acquisition of microbes from the environment kaltenpoth  steiger 2014. in addition phylogeneti- cally diverse yarrowia-like yeasts were detected in adult and larval life stages the beetles' exudates and in beetle-prepared carrion indicating parent to offspring transmission of the yeast through the carcass surface kaltenpoth  steiger 2014 vogel et al.

results  shifts in microbial communities during carcass preparationto study the changes in the microbial community of carcasses asso- ciated with their preparation by beetles we sampled the same set of carcasses before and after beetles took possession figure 1. there were significant differences in bacterial diversity between the untreated carcasses stage 2 treated before larvae arrived and feeding and nonfeeding regions of stage 3 treated with larvae car- casses anosim analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances p  .01 999 permutations.

by contrast yarrowia was not detected in untreated carcasses on decomposing carcasses that had no exposure to beetles or in the soil appearing on carcasses only after beetles initiate carcass prepa- ration.
