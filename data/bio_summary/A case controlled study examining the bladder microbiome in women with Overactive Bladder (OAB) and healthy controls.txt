The genus lactobacillus was present less commonly in urine from OAB patients when compared to urine taken from controls p  0.02.

A total of 95 different genera were identified from the urine samples.Conclusion The female human bladder has a diverse microbiome with stastistically significant differences between bacterial species present in OAB patients and controls.c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.IntroductionHistorically urine was considered to be sterile but current evidence suggests that this is not the case .

Multiple organisms can be identified in the urine of women with and without overactive bladder OAB with a negative mid- stream urine MSU culture processed in a hospital microbiology laboratory .

The urine remaining from the original sample collection was subsequently taken for further study specific laboratory testing within four hours of initial collection.Bacterial species isolation and amplificationA 5 ml urine sample was taken and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 mins the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 50 ml of the supernatant and 5 ml streaked onto two chocolate agar plates Eand O laboratories.

The collection of urine samples in the study were approved by the National Research Ethics Service where required.ResultsThe urine samples of 95 women were analysed 60 from women with OAB and 35 from healthy female controls with over 700 bacterial colonies characterised.

Of all urine samples tested 97.8 grew at least one bacterial species and a total of 66 different bacterial genera were identified resident in the urine of both cohorts at different frequencies Appendix A.

found Lactobacillus in 29 of control urine samples compared with 12 of urine samples from patients with OAB .

Moreover another study comparing bacteria in the urine from women with urgency urinary incontinence UUI to that in the urine of controls found decreased Lactobacillus amongst the UUI group .

Lactobacillus has additionally been identified in the urine of men and from suprapubic aspirate providing further evidence that Lactobacillus colonisation of urine is not solely due to vaginal contamination.

A study comparing CSUs to MSUs and relating this to symptoms is needed to fully address this.Data trends observed in this study regarding pathogenicorganisms commonly seen in patients with urinary tract infection indicated that these bacteria were more commonly identified in the urine of patients with OAB than urine of controls.
