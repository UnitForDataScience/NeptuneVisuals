Thus we distinguished cross 2 larvae that did not express the tumor non-cancerous larvae henceforth referred to as G from those showing the GFP-labeled tumor cancerous larvae henceforth C.After determining the cancerous status we obtained 30 larvae for each group cancerous non-cancerous and control and three control microbiota-free larvae of each cross.

Alternatively colonization of axenic larvae with modified Bacillaceae unable to produce LPS could help distinguishing if LPS production is the only active mechanism involved in cancer development.Drosophila is a recognized model for cancer studyand may be useful in the study of questions that may notbe addressable with human biological data.

Therefore one could expect that immune responses directed towards cancer cells in the brain could affect the microbial community in the gut or that alteration in microbiota structure could result in cancer proliferation.

Such experiments are defi- nitely crucial before being able extrapolating to human diseases because intestinal microbiota is not considered to be heritable--or to a very low extent--whereas several oncogenic mutations could be.The bacterial signature between cancerous and non-cancerous individuals is due to the Bacillaceae family.However our study does not test if a higher relative abundance of this family protects against cancer development or conversely if the development of cancer cells affects Bacillaceae populations specifically.

Thus we hypothesize that species of Bacillaceae could help to eliminate cancer cells at the beginning of carcinogenesis and therefore avoiding cancer emergence for individuals carrying oncogenic mutations.

Most human studies linking microbiota structure and diversity to cancer principally colorectal cancer have identified changes in the proportions of Bacteroides in communities seefor a review.

In this context the long-distance crosstalk between brain cancer and intestinal microbiota should be investigated in humans in order to identify precise bacterial signatures of brain cancer.

Further studies should consider interactions of alimentation with the gut-brain axis to accurately identify bacterial cancer signatures.The three-way interconnection between intestinal microbiome cancer and the immune system is increas-ingly recognized.

Second we identified a bacterial signature at the family level of cancer cancerous larvae host a significantly lower relative abundance of Bacillaceae than individuals that did not develop the tumor.

We characterized the diversity and structure of the intestinal microbiota in Drosophila larvae developing a cancer of the eye-antennal disc.
