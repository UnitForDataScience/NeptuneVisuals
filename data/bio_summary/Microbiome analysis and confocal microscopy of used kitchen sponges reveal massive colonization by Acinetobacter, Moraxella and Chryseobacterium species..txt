After removal of chimeric OTUs 1371 singleton OTUs 2218 and further plas- tidic OTUs 63 362 bacterial OTUs remained representing a total of 27473 sequences 357-1418 sequences per sample with an average of 981.2 reads per sample Supplementary Figure .

Our dataset was based on 14 sponges sepa- rated into top and bottom parts each and yielded 362 OTUs in total with an average of 31 OTUs 8-62 and an average PD of 4.28 1.92-7.46 per sample not including singleton OTUs.

If singleton OTUs were included the total number of OTUs would increase to 1823 and our dataset would yield an average of 96 OTUs 42-199 and an average PD of 10.06 5.08-18.50 per sponge sample.

To identify significant patterns of correlated bacteria in the used kitchen sponges the OTUs with a relative frequency higher than 0.5 of the total non-rarified sequence dataset 27 OTUs in total were subjected to a Spearman correlation analysis of the occurrence patterns .

Five of the ten most abundant OTUs were closely related to risk group 2 RG2 species previously detected in the BE and kitchen microbiome.

Two of the ten dominant OTUs closely related to the RG2-species Chryseobacterium hominis and Moraxella osloensis showed significantly greater proportions in regularly sanitized sponges thereby questioning such sanitation methods in a long term perspective.

After lengthquality filtering a total of 33181 high quality sequences were kept Supplementary log File  which were then grouped into 4014 OTUs at 97 sequence similarity threshold.

No mitochondrial OTUs occurred.

The sequence dataset was submitted to EMBL  under the project number PRJEB18578.The taxonomic assignment of the OTUs performed by QIIME according to the RDP database revealed 9 phyla 17 classes 35 orders 73 families and 118 genera Fig.

The ten most abun- dant OTUs accounted for 68.72 of all sequences and were quite ubiquitous each occurring in 11 to 14 sponges with the only exception of OTU1492 that was detected in 8 sponges only.
