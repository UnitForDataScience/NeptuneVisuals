The second round of nifH PCR used the same components and thermocycling conditions as the first round except the DNA extract was replaced with 1 uL of the amplified product generated during the first round PCR reaction and custom primers were used consisting of gene-specific sites nifH1 and nifH2 dual- indexed barcodes Illumina linkers and a sequencing primer binding region similar to those described by Kozich et al.

The first round contained 1X PCR buffer 0.1U Platinum High Fidelity Taq polymerase Invitrogen 200 umol L-1 dNTPs 3 BSA 4 mmol L-1 Mg2 1 uL DNA or cDNA and 1 umol L-1 nifH3 and nifH4 primers Zani et al.

Forward and reverse nifH PCR primers are indicated by nifH1 TGYGAYCCNAARGCNGA and nifH2 ADNGCCATCATYTCNCC note the misprint of this primer in the original manuscript by Zani et al.

PCR negative controls and filter blank samples were included in PCR reactions.Finally there was a mistake in the legend for Supplementary Table 1 as published.
