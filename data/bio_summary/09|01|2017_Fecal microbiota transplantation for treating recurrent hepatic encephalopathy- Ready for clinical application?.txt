The frequent administration of antibiot- ics further disrupts gut microbiota in cirrhotic patients.

The authors published the first open-label randomized controlled trial RCT of single FMT versus SOC in 20 male patients with more than two episodes of overt HE.

The most discriminat- ing methodology in this study was the selection of a rationally selected donor.

The primary outcome was the occurrence of serious adverse events SAEs which were defined by the rate of mortality rate of hospitalization number of hospital admissions and number infections.

The secondary outcome was neurological and cognitive changes.

The relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Rumi-nococcaceae primarily beneficial bacteria increased in HE patients and significantly reduced after the adminis- tration of antibiotics.

The use of a rationally selected donor from a stool bank microbiome profile is studied and well-known is ground- breaking for gut microbiota modulation therapies.There are some weak points that should be considered.

The sample size of patients who underwent FMT was relatively small although this is the largest trial on FMT in cirrhosis patients.

The primary outcome was safety.

The 3-month readmission rate remains unacceptably high in a large North American cohort of patients with cirrhosis.
