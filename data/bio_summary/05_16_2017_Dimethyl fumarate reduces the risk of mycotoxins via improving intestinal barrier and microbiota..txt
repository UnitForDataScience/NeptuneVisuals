In the TC treatment the bacteria richness in ileum was similar to the control group but a significant decreasing was detected both in the jejunum and colon.The Shannon index analysis Table 1 indicated that in the TC treatment the Shannon index was always the lowest no matter compared to the DMF or the NC one.

TC traditional control DMF dimethyl fumarate NC negative control.Table 1 Effects of DMF on bacterial communities' diversity in the jejunal ileal and colonic digesta 121Sequences with similarity scores greater than or equal to 0.97 were clustered into an OTU.2NC negative control TC traditional control DMF dimethyl fumarate OTU operational taxonomic unit.such as the colon the Shannon index after DMF treatment was similar to both control groups.Jejunal bacteria community structureJejunal bacterial community of three groups shared with 249 OTUs as shown in Venn diagrams which accounted for 33.29 of the proportion Figure 4A.

Lactobacillaceae was significantly increased in TC group from 33.37 to 78.03 while the proportion of S24-7 dropped dramatically from 39.25 to 0.14 and 26.69 after applying TC and DMF separately.

NC negative control TC traditional control DMF dimethyl fumarate.still detect the decreased trend in the TC from 50.27 to 45.84 and the increased trend in the DMF group from 50.27 to 69.80.Within these two dominating phyla there were some significant changes of each treatment at family level when compared to the NC group.

These reported germicidal functions of TC 10 11 was paralleled with our research that three major mycotoxins such as AFB1 ppb FB1ppm and ZEAppb were all significantly deceased in the TC group.

Ourstudy also showed that the detoxification function of TC in ZEA was even much better than DMF indicating that there were some individual functions between TC and ZEA.

It seemed contradictory to the effective anti-mildew capacity of TC as former reported to some extent but actually TC could inhibit mold growth and the toxin production only on the surface of grain.

Our study also compared with the ultraviolet radiation UR treatment a traditional anti-mildew control TC.

Moreover the efficiency of DMF was better than TC P  0.05.

The most abundant OTUs belonged to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and their changes in DMF were more moderate than the TC group suggesting a more stable micro- ecology and the positive impact of DMF on the biodiversity of intestine.
