The abundance of Lactoba- cillaceae was higher in ileal digesta 16 than in feces 2 and contrary the abundance of Ruminococcaceae was higher in feces 23 than in ileal digesta 0.5.Table 6 Results from PERMANOVA test for dietary effect on 16S rRNA sequencing data from ileal digesta1Pperm-value of protein level2Pperm-value of probiotic supplementation with Bacillus spp.3Pperm-value of interaction between protein level and probiotic supplementation with Bacillus spp.Table 7 Ileal gene copy numbersa in ileal digesta of growing pigsHigh-proteinLow-proteinSEMP-valueItem--P1B2Px B31P-value of protein level2P-value of probiotic supplementation with Bacillus spp.3P-value of interaction between protein level and probiotic supplementation with Bacillus spp.alog10 16S rRNA gene copiesg digesta LS means and standard error of the meansbcWithin a row LS means with a common superscript are not different at a  0.05DiscussionAccording to previous studies B. subtilis and B. licheni- formis produce extracellular enzymes including prote- ases and a-amylase which may enhance nutrient digestibility resulting in improved feed conver- sion in finisher pigs In addition B. subtilis exceedsB.

in cecal samples of pigs while supplementa- tion of diets with B. subtilis and B. licheniformis showed similar results in slurry samples from pigs due to a lowering effect on the pH Therefore LP dietssupplemented with B. subtilis and B. licheniformis might be used to reduce the production of harmful microbial metabolites in the large intestine of pigs.ConclusionsSupplementation with Bacillus spp.

In the present study the dietary CP level and the supple- mentation of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis showed an interaction as supplementation of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis increased Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyro- monas in the LP diets when compared to HP diets.

such as Ba- cillus subtilis B. subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis B. licheniformis are frequently supplemented to pig diets - as these two species have been listed to be added as non-toxigenic biological supplements to livestock di- ets  and additionally they are widely used for the large-scale industrial production of proteins including extracellular enzymes Positive effects of dietary sup- plementation of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis on pigs' growth performance have been reported before Activity of probiotics is influenced by diet composition and variations in dietary protein supply thereby pos- sibly affecting microbial composition in the gut  .

A high diversity in intestinal microbiota might be preferable to cope effectively with potential challenging conditions .Regardless of dietary protein level the supplementa- tion of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis had a stimulating effect on targeted quantity of Roseburia spp.

Pigs' BW was determined at the beginning of each experimental period.The assay diets were based on wheat barley and soy- bean meal with 2 protein levels resulting in a low- protein 14 CP as-fed LP and a high-protein diet 18 CP as-fed HP.

The analyzed CP and AA contents of the assay diets and mi- crobial numbers of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis in assay diets are presented in Table As expected CP and AA contents in LP were approximately 76.5 and 76.6 that of HP respectively.

The LP diet supplemented with B. sub- tilis and B. licheniformis may be used as an alternative feeding strategy to support gut health in pigs.AbbreviationsAA Amino acid ADF Acid detergent fiber ADL Acid detergent lignin AID Apparent ileal digestibility ANOSIM Analysis of similarity BW Body weight CFU Colony forming units CP Crude protein DM Dry matter GIT Gastrointestinal tract HP High-protein diet LP Low-protein diet ME Metabolizable energy N Nitrogen NDF Neutral detergent fiberOTU Operativ taxonomic unit PERMANOVA Permutational multivariate analysis of variance qPCR Quantitative real-time PCR RELATE Mantel type test SCFA Short chain fatty acids SID Standardized ileal digestibilityAcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank S.

However concerning antibiotic resist- ance which is considered to be an important key re- quirement for probiotics a higher concentration of antibiotics is tolerated by B. licheniformis than by B. sub- tilis Recently probiotic characteristics were de- scribed for spores of B. subtilis although interactions with porcine epithelial cells are not understood so farFor example the supplementation of B. subtilis to a soybean meal diet showed slight improvements in AID and SID of some AA in weaning pigs as described by Kim et al.
