the abundance of lactoba- cillaceae was higher in ileal digesta 16 than in feces 2 and contrary the abundance of ruminococcaceae was higher in feces 23 than in ileal digesta 0.5.table 6 results from permanova test for dietary effect on 16s rrna sequencing data from ileal digesta1pperm-value of protein level2pperm-value of probiotic supplementation with bacillus spp.3pperm-value of interaction between protein level and probiotic supplementation with bacillus spp.table 7 ileal gene copy numbersa in ileal digesta of growing pigshigh-proteinlow-proteinsemp-valueitem--p1b2px b31p-value of protein level2p-value of probiotic supplementation with bacillus spp.3p-value of interaction between protein level and probiotic supplementation with bacillus spp.alog10 16s rrna gene copiesg digesta ls means and standard error of the meansbcwithin a row ls means with a common superscript are not different at a  0.05discussionaccording to previous studies b. subtilis and b. licheni- formis produce extracellular enzymes including prote- ases and a-amylase which may enhance nutrient digestibility resulting in improved feed conver- sion in finisher pigs in addition b. subtilis exceedsb.

this is con- firmed by the results of a recent study  where sid of cp and most aa decreased linearly with increasing diet- ary cp from 6.8 to 21.4 as-fed due to the greater ndf and adf contents.the higher numbers of lactobacillus spp.

the basal ileal endogenous loss of cp and aa iaaend is considered to be constant among groups of pigs and therefore mean values for iaaend can be used for transformation of aid into their sid values.the sid of cp and aa in assay diets was estimated according to the following equationsidd 14 aidd th diaaend adth x 100 where sidd  sid of cp or aa in the assay diet .statistical analyseshomogeneity of variances and normal distribution of the data were confirmed using the univariate pro- cedure of sas sas inst.

it has been suggested that increasing age may be a contributing factor in building up the complexity of the microbial community  with growing pigs being more resistant to intestinal disorders than young pigs .dietary content of cp has been reported to be associ- ated with aid due to the variation in endogenous cp and aa losses in ileal digesta .

this variation along sampling sites is in agreement with a previous study in- vestigating as well ileal digesta and fecal samples from pigs where abundance patterns of prevotella species in the git of pigs were different between ileal digesta and fecal samples.the results of this study demonstrate an overall lower bacterial diversity for ileal digesta compared with fecal samples.

resulted in a higher abundance of healthy gut associated bacteria without affecting ileal cp and aa digestibility whereas lp diet may reduce the flow of undigested protein to the large intestine of pigs.keywords bacillus spp.

in contrast increasing the dietary cp intake may stimulate the prolif- eration of almost all bacteria groups over the entire git including beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium spp.

the assay diets were based on wheat-barley-soybean meal with two protein levels lp 14 cp as-fed and hp diet 18 cp as-fed.

pigs' bw was determined at the beginning of each experimental period.the assay diets were based on wheat barley and soy- bean meal with 2 protein levels resulting in a low- protein 14 cp as-fed lp and a high-protein diet 18 cp as-fed hp.

during each of the 3 experimental periods the pigs were allowed to adapt to their assay diets for 14 d before ileal digesta was collected for a total of 24 h from 0700 to 1900 h on d 15 and from 1900 on d 16 to 0700 h on d 17. digesta collection procedure wastable 1 ingredient composition of assay diets  as-fed basisitemhigh-proteinlow-proteinbarley20.0015.00wheat51.0038.24soybean meal21.5116.13oila1.501.50cornstarchb2.0825.55vitamins and minerals premixc0.760.76sodium chloride0.070.07l-lysine-hcle0.610.46dl-methioninee0.220.16l-isoleucinee0.030.02l-valinee0.120.09titanium dioxide0.400.40bacillus spp.f-- calculated chemical compositiongmetabolizable energy mjkg13.4314.25crude protein 18.0014.00calcium 0.660.63available phosphorus 0.270.25sidg lysine 1.200.92sidg methionine 0.430.33sidg threonine 0.730.56for each sampling period freeze-dried and ground to0.5 mm prior to analyses.
