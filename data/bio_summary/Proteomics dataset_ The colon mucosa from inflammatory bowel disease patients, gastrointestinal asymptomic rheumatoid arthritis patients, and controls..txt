Direct download links Value of the dataThe dataset contains the largest number of identified human proteins from colon mucosa biopsies as of 2017.The dataset was obtained in one batch allowing for label-free comparison of the colon mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls.The first dataset of the colon mucosa of gastrointestinal healthy RA patients.The datasets can be analyzed for novel proteome effects of disease and treatments.The datasets allow for extended statistical analysis and we encourage such collaborations.DataThe datasets in this article provides information on the proteome of the colon mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients with ulcerative colitis  gastrointestinal healthy rheumatoid arthritis patients  and controls.

Studies have found an altered composition of the gut microbiota in rheumatoid arthritis patients Zhang et al.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license Neutrophil extracellular traps DatasetSigmoidoscopy Colonoscopycolon mucosa biopsies from 10 inflammatory bowel disease ulcera- tive colitis UC patients 11 gastrointestinal healthy rheumatoid arthritis RA patients and 10 controls.

The proteomics data and search results have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Con- sortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifiers PXD001608 for ulcerative colitis and control samples and PXD003082 for rheumatoid arthritis samples.

The biopsies were tryptic digested and analyzed by electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.The Laboratory for Medical Mass Spectrometry Department of Health Science and Technology Aalborg University Fredrik Bajers Vej 7E 9220 Aalborg East DenmarkData accessibilityThe proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Con- sortium via the PRIDE partner repository -with dataset identifiers PXD001608 - Ulcerative colitis patients and controls.PXD003082 - Gastrointestinal healthy rheumatoid arthritis patients.

The study was motivated by the finding of an altered composition of the gut microbiota in rheumatoid arthritis patients - and inflammatory bowel disease patients -.

The unprocessed pro- teomics data files  and processed search result files  have been deposited to the Pro- teomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD001608 forulcerative colitis and control samples and PXD003082 for rheumatoid arthritis samples .A cumulated 6768 proteins FDRo1 were identified representing the largest proteome dataset of the colon mucosa so far.

Additionally the dataset represents the first analysis of the colon mucosa of gastrointestinal healthy rheumatoid arthritis patients.
