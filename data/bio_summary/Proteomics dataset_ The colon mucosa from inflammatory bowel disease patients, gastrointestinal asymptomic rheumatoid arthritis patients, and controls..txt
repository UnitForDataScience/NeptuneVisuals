additional information regarding the participants can be found in the publications.experimental design materials and methodsstudy cohort and sample collectionthe sample material was extracted and processed as described in and .colon mucosal biopsies roughly 1 mm3 were sampled 40 cm from the anus by sigmoidoscopy at the regional hospital silkeborg denmark from 10 ulcerative colitis patients 11 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 10 controls in the period from 2012 to 2013. the biopsies were immediately transferred to cryotubes and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at minus 80 degc until proteomics sample preparation.
