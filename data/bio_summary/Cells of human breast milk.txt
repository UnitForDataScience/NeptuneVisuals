Studies performed in the 1950s revealed that colostrum contains epithelial cells In the last decade it was shown that in addition to these cell populations breast milk contains stem and progenitor cells The presence of stem and pro- genitor cells in the mammary gland and breast milk was postulated earlier based on the ability of the mammary gland to program changes and transforms into the fully secretory state during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.Thus human breastmilk contains heterogeneous cell populations including lactocytes milk-secretory cells myoepithelial cells from the ducts and alveoli of mammarygland and a hierarchy of progenitor and stem cells.

It is possible that hBSCs may originate from the maternal bloodstream like the CD34 hematopoietic stem cells also present in human milk Without any doubt breast milk contains a hierarchy of cells from early-stage embryonic-like stem cells to fully differentiated mammary epithelial cells.

Their properties role and mechanism of transfer from maternal blood into breast milk require further study.Non-immune cells and stemprogenitor human breast milk cellsWhile the nutritional and protective function of breast milk has been previously exam- ined little is known about the properties and roles of the non-immune cells that are present.

no convincing evidence currently exists supporting the presence of MSCs in breast milk The existence of pluripotent stem cells within human breast milk human breast milk stem cells hBSCs was reported for the first time in 2012 by Hassiotou et al.

A time-course analysis of OCT4 SOX2 and NANOG mRNA expression from days 1 to 12 of spheroid formation revealed a stable upregulation of these genes.It has been shown that hBSCs may differentiate in vitro into adipose cells chondro- cytes osteoblasts neuronal cells hepatocyte-like cells and pancreatic beta cells.

The heterogeneous mixture of breast milk cells includes leukocytes epithelial cells stem cells and bacteria.

confirmed the presence of live bacteria moving inside the extracellular matrix of immune cells In another study bacterial translocation from gut to mesenteric lymph nodes and mammary glands in pregnant and lactating mice was observed It has been suggested that bacterial translocation to extraintestinal tissues is a beneficial physiological event in a healthy host and it may be associated with maturation of the neonatal immune system.Table 2 Probiotic bacterial species isolated from the breast milk of healthy womenConclusionsDuring pregnancy labor and lactation a gradual remodeling of the mammary gland occurs facilitated by the orchestrated secretion of the lactogenic hormone complex which acts on mammary stem and progenitor cells.Milk composition varies and depend on stage of lactation the degree of breast full- ness infant feeding the mother and infant health status and many other factors and may be associated with the maternal diet and environment and potentially with genetic factors Milk is a complex fluid composed of several phases that can be separated by centrifu- gation into a cream layer an aqueous phase and a pellet that consists of milk cells.

Typically breast milk is thought to contain epithelial cells and immune cells.
