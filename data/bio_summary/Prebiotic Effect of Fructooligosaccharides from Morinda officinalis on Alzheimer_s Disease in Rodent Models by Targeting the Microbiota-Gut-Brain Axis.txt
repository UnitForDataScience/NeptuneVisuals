studies in germ-free animals and those exposed to pathogenic microbial infections antibiotics probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation suggest the link of gut microbiota with host cognition or ad-related pathogenesis      .several studies have supported the theory of the occurrence of a pathway of communication between the gut and the brain modulated by gut microbiota   .

together with the changes in the gut microbiota community diversity shown in  and the transcriptome analysis data of intestine and brain we concluded that the ab1-42 levels in hippocampus interact the gut and microbiota although further studies are essential for substantiation.antibiotics intervention in appsweps1e9 mouse model suggests that the diversity of the gut microbiota community can regulate the host innate immunity mechanisms that impact ab amyloidosis  .

our data in d-galactose-induced deficient rats showed that the akkermansia were increased p  0.05  and the intestinal pathological tissue changes  were improved after administration of omo thereby indicating that omo administration can improve the gut barrier function via targeting the abundance of akkermansia but need more studies.increased gut permeability leaky gut and alterations in gut microbiota are now widely accepted as an important link with the etiology course and treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders  .

we also monitored the transcriptome of the small intestine and brain tissues at the 5th week after injection of ab1-42.dynamic variations of gut microbiota and kegg pathway analysis in the ab1 42-induced deficient ratsthe dynamic variations of gut microbiota showed that the diversity in the ab1-42-induced microbial community injected10 or 20 ug fibrillar state of ab1-42 into the ca1 regiongroup was reduced in the 4th week l3 h3 than that in the 2nd and 3rd week l1 l2 and h1 h2 as shown in  thereby indicating that such a diversity was reduced with the progression of the disease.

the go term enrichment results showed that the immune system extracellular environment and antigen reaction supplementary tables s1-1-s1-3 altered in different ab1-42 levels treated groups which indicated that the inflammatory response of the gut is activated the variations in the gut microbiota induced by ab1-42 primarily influences the immune or inflammatory response in the gut.the kegg pathway results showed that the degs were mainly enriched in phagosome antigen processing andpresentation cell adhesion molecules cams pi3k-akt signaling pathway cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction ppar signaling pathway ecm-receptor interaction b cell receptor signaling pathway and chemokine signaling pathway  and more details were showed in supplementary tables s2-1- s2-3 thereby indicating that ab1-42 levels in the brain can influence the intestinal functions.brain transcriptome analysisafter injection of ab1-42 for 4 weeks the rats were sacrificed and the brain tissues dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for rna extraction and high-throughput rna-sequencing.

in addition omo administration exerted an adequate prebiotic role in regulating the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota in an overdose antibiotics-treated ibd mice model.gut microbiota plays a major role in maintaining normal physiological functions in the host.

the modulation of gut microbiota by germ-free animals probiotics or antibiotics intervention and fecal microbiota transplantation fmt can influence the cognitive behavior of the host  .

although the complex networks of communication between the gut microbiota and the brain are not yet fully elucidates it is clear that prebiotics strongly modulates the ecology of the microbiota.

9403. doi gut microbiota influences the central nervous system disorders such as alzheimer's disease ad.

16s rrna sequencing of gut microbiota indicated that omo administration maintains the diversity and stability of the microbial community.

in addition omo regulated the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease ibd mice model treated by overdosed antibiotics and thus showed the prebiotic potential.

moreover gut microbiota plays a major role in neurodevelopment leading to alterations in gene expression in critical brain and intestinal regions thereby resulting in perturbation to the programming of normal cognitive behaviors.

taken together our findings suggest thatthe therapeutic effect of the traditional medicine m. officinalis on various neurological diseases such as ad is at least partially contributed by its naturally occurring chemical constituent omo via modulating the interaction between gut ecology and brain physiology.keywords fructooligosaccharides prebiotics alzheimer's disease behavior microbiota-gut-brain axisintroductiongut microbiota is associated with several diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson's disease pd and alzheimer's disease ad   .

previous findings strengthened the evidence supporting the therapeutic targeting of gut microbiota in brain-gut axis disorders thereby opening new prospects in the field of nutritional neuropsychopharmacology.

together these results demonstrated that the omo administration could ameliorate the d-galactose-induced deficient rats.changes in gut microbiota after omo administration operational taxonomic unit otu abundance and taxonomic profiles were analyzed as shown in .
