similarly nod2 was reported to be associated with acute experimental and clinical acute gvhd.3 the role of prrs in acute gvhd has been covered in other recent reviews.3nonetheless the prrs do not completely allow for understanding the changes in microbial communities and their causal role if any in acute gvhd severity.5  microbial metabolites and acute gvhd the changes in microbiome structure cause a change in intestinal metabolites.

of interest one small study in 20 healthy young adults showed that potato-based starches induce production of bu- tyrate from the microbiota.49 a clinical trial of this prebiotic aimed at increasing butyrate levels and prevention of acute gvhd is under- way nct02763033.currently there is paucity of data on other intestinal microbial metabolites and their impact in acute gvhd table 1. however one clinical study in allo-hct patients showed that lower levels of urine 3-indoxyl sulfate a metabolite derived from indole produced by com- mensal bacteria and an ahr ligand correlated with higher treatment related mortality and lower overall survival.506  future perspectives the aforementioned recent study which explored the role of microbial metabolites in acute gvhd severity45 raises several interesting ques- tions including but not limited to whether it is possible to mitigate gi damage by directly affecting target cells without substantially af- fecting the immune system.51 do other scfas a role or is this unique to butyrate if so then is butyrate protective primarily by inhibiting hdacs andor by providing energy to the iecs under duress from in- flammation this study demonstrated that microbial metabolites are critical and suggest these are relevant causal mediators of the micro- bial changes associated with acute gvhd severity.45 it opens up ques- tions for the putative roles of other metabolites their correlation and relationship to the dynamics of microbiome alterations the role of sen- sors of these metabolites the impact of these on immune system on iecs iscs paneth cells and other tissues in acute gvhd.

a reduction in ahr ligands in response to cyp1a1 enzyme activity in the iecs decreased th17 cells and impaired il-22 production in response to enteric infections.314  intestinal microbiota and acute gvhd a healthy intestinal microbiota is diverse and dominated by obligate anaerobic bacteria.1 during the process of allo-hct patients lose this diversity and experience alterations in community composition which are influenced by antibiotic treatment and the development of acute gvhd.32-34 holler et al showed a shift towards enterococci after allo-hct with a decrease in the obligate anaerobic bacteria from the phylum frimicutes that was pronounced in those that were treated with antibiotics.32 thus the process of allo-hct has been shown to alter the intestinal microbiota composition and affect the intestinal homeostasis.reciprocally the intestinal microbiota has been shown to mod- ulate post allo-hct outcomes including acute gvhd.35-38 studies from the 1970s investigated the role of the intestinal mcirobiota in allo-hct and found less acute gvhd in mice transplanted in germ- free conditions or receiving gut decontamination antibiotics.4 some follow-up clinical studies showed similar beneficial effects of bacterial decontamination in allo-hct patients while a few others did not.39-42 the reasons for these disparate results remain unclear but couldbe due to variation in success of decontamination techniques or the specifics of the alteration in the microbiota composition rather than just a global loss of diversity.

host microbial sensing by pathogen recog- nition receptors prrs has been suggested to play a role in modu- lating experimental acute gvhd.3 for example donor cell responses to pamps such as lipopolysaccharides lps amplifies experimental acute gvhd.3 in humans tlr4 polymorphisms were associated with lower risk of acute gvhd.43 tlr9 was shown to play a role in an ex- perimental model of acute gvhd.

of particular interest ahr was necessary for expansion of il-22 producing ilcs.30 il-22 is an epithelial cell regenerative factor and il-22 producing ilcs were found to be depleted in the intestines of mice with acute gvhd and treatment with il-22 enhanced the recovery of iscs increased epithelial regeneration and reduced acute gvhd.52 administration of il-22 along with systemic corticosteroids is now being investigated in a clinical trial for initial treatment of grade ii-iv lower gi acute gvhd nct02406651 but the role that ahr plays in modulating il-22 producing ilcs in acute gvhd and whether dietary ligands can modulate that role are yet to be investigated.

high intestinal abundance of blautia correlated with lower rates of acute gvhd and improved survival.36 it was recently shown that administration of a cocktail of 17 species of clostridia reduced experimental acute gvhd and improved survival.45 these data sug- gest that changing the microbial architecture in the right manner may be a potentially novel approach for ameliorating acute gvhd.

of in- terest recent very small studies suggested that fmt after allo-hct issafe and may have clinical impact in patients with advanced acute gi gvhd.46-48most of the aforementioned studies of the effect of the microbi- ota on acute gvhd are based on associations but the causations and potential mechanisms of how the microbiota modulates acute gvhd severity remain unknown.

while these data suggest protective effects on acute gvhd could occur inde- pendent of donor tregs the study did not explore whether host tregs played a role in acute gvhd protection.

however the effective- ness of allo-h ct is limited by acute graft versus host disease gvhd which is the principal cause of non-r elapse mortality.2 conditioning regimens used in allo-h ct cause host tissue injuries which release danger signals that activate host or donor antigen presenting cells apcs which in turn present allo-a ntigens via major histocompati- bility complex mhc class i or class ii to donor t cells.3 in addition activated apcs produce t- cell stimulating cytokines which further escalate the inflammatory response.

stimulated donor t cells expand and differentiate into effector t cells which migrate into and damage acute gvhd target organs such as the gastrointestinal gi tract.

20181823-29. c 2017 the american society of transplantation  23 and the american society of transplant surgeonsthe relationship between the intestinal microbiota and acute gvhd has been a topic of interest since the 1970s following seminal observations by van bekkum et al in experimental models.4 however scrupulous examination of this relationship has become possible only recently with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies.

emerging data suggest that alterations in the intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites may play important roles in modulating the se- verity of acute gvhd.

in this review we summarize these data and recent efforts that investigated the roles of the intestinal microbial metabolites in shaping the host immune system as well as discuss po- tential new avenues for exploring these roles in intestinal acute gvhd.2  intestinal microbiotaherein we briefly discuss intestinal microbiota and its role in interact- ing with the immune system and modulating intestinal homeostasis.

recent studies show that changes in microbial composition post allo-hct were more pronounced in those that developed acute gvhd including greater loss of diversity ex- pansion of enterobacteriales lactobacillales proteobacteria and akkermansia.4344 this was accompanied by the loss of obligate an- aerobic bacteria from the phylum firmicutes including clostridia and blautia.
