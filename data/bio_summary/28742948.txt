A reduction in AhR ligands in response to Cyp1a1 enzyme activity in the IECs decreased Th17 cells and impaired Il-22 production in response to enteric infections.314  INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA AND ACUTE GVHD A healthy intestinal microbiota is diverse and dominated by obligate anaerobic bacteria.1 During the process of allo-HCT patients lose this diversity and experience alterations in community composition which are influenced by antibiotic treatment and the development of acute GVHD.32-34 Holler et al showed a shift towards Enterococci after allo-HCT with a decrease in the obligate anaerobic bacteria from the phylum Frimicutes that was pronounced in those that were treated with antibiotics.32 Thus the process of allo-HCT has been shown to alter the intestinal microbiota composition and affect the intestinal homeostasis.Reciprocally the intestinal microbiota has been shown to mod- ulate post allo-HCT outcomes including acute GVHD.35-38 Studies from the 1970s investigated the role of the intestinal mcirobiota in allo-HCT and found less acute GVHD in mice transplanted in germ- free conditions or receiving gut decontamination antibiotics.4 Some follow-up clinical studies showed similar beneficial effects of bacterial decontamination in allo-HCT patients while a few others did not.39-42 The reasons for these disparate results remain unclear but couldbe due to variation in success of decontamination techniques or the specifics of the alteration in the microbiota composition rather than just a global loss of diversity.

Host microbial sensing by pathogen recog- nition receptors PRRs has been suggested to play a role in modu- lating experimental acute GVHD.3 For example donor cell responses to PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharides LPS amplifies experimental acute GVHD.3 In humans TLR4 polymorphisms were associated with lower risk of acute GVHD.43 TLR9 was shown to play a role in an ex- perimental model of acute GVHD.

Similarly NOD2 was reported to be associated with acute experimental and clinical acute GVHD.3 The role of PRRs in acute GVHD has been covered in other recent reviews.3Nonetheless the PRRs do not completely allow for understanding the changes in microbial communities and their causal role if any in acute GVHD severity.5  MICROBIAL METABOLITES AND ACUTE GVHD The changes in microbiome structure cause a change in intestinal metabolites.

Of particular interest AhR was necessary for expansion of IL-22 producing ILCs.30 IL-22 is an epithelial cell regenerative factor and IL-22 producing ILCs were found to be depleted in the intestines of mice with acute GVHD and treatment with IL-22 enhanced the recovery of ISCs increased epithelial regeneration and reduced acute GVHD.52 Administration of IL-22 along with systemic corticosteroids is now being investigated in a clinical trial for initial treatment of grade II-IV lower GI acute GVHD NCT02406651 but the role that AhR plays in modulating IL-22 producing ILCs in acute GVHD and whether dietary ligands can modulate that role are yet to be investigated.

Of in- terest recent very small studies suggested that FMT after allo-HCT issafe and may have clinical impact in patients with advanced acute GI GVHD.46-48Most of the aforementioned studies of the effect of the microbi- ota on acute GVHD are based on associations but the causations and potential mechanisms of how the microbiota modulates acute GVHD severity remain unknown.

High intestinal abundance of Blautia correlated with lower rates of acute GVHD and improved survival.36 It was recently shown that administration of a cocktail of 17 species of Clostridia reduced experimental acute GVHD and improved survival.45 These data sug- gest that changing the microbial architecture in the right manner may be a potentially novel approach for ameliorating acute GVHD.

A recent study explored the role of microbial metabo-TABLE 1 Microbial metabolites involved in maintaining the health of the intestinal barrier surface and modulating immune responses and their known roles in acute graft versus host disease GVHDShort chain fatty acids SCFADirect effect of the SCFA butyrateon intestinal epithelial cells IECs reduced severity of experimental intestinal acute GVHDBile acidsTo be determinedPolyaminesTo be determinedlites in acute GVHD severity.45 The study reported data primarily on SCFAs and long chain fatty acids LCFAs from skin intestine and liver post experimental allo-HCT.

However one clinical study in allo-HCT patients showed that lower levels of urine 3-indoxyl sulfate a metabolite derived from indole produced by com- mensal bacteria and an AhR ligand correlated with higher treatment related mortality and lower overall survival.506  FUTURE PERSPECTIVES The aforementioned recent study which explored the role of microbial metabolites in acute GVHD severity45 raises several interesting ques- tions including but not limited to whether it is possible to mitigate GI damage by directly affecting target cells without substantially af- fecting the immune system.51 Do other SCFAs a role or is this unique to butyrate If so then is butyrate protective primarily by inhibiting HDACs andor by providing energy to the IECs under duress from in- flammation This study demonstrated that microbial metabolites are critical and suggest these are relevant causal mediators of the micro- bial changes associated with acute GVHD severity.45 It opens up ques- tions for the putative roles of other metabolites their correlation and relationship to the dynamics of microbiome alterations the role of sen- sors of these metabolites the impact of these on immune system on IECs ISCs Paneth cells and other tissues in acute GVHD.

Repeated fecal microbiota transplantations attenuate diarrhea and lead to sustained changes in the fecal microbiota in acute refractory gastrointestinal graft-versus- host-disease.

Germ free mice colonized with conventional intestinal microbiota devel- oped innate immune responses and structural changes with increase in the depth of the intestinal epithelial crypts as well as expansion in the lamina propria with an increase in the immune cells within 4 days after exposure to intestinal bacteria.7 The intestinal microbiota was also linked to the regulation of adaptive immune cells as intesti- nal commensal microbes were shown to induce forkhead box protein Foxp3- expressing regulatory T cells Tregs which produce IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine.8 In contrast stimuli associated withpathogenic bacteria cause inflammatory responses via IL-1 and IL-6 induction which result in Th1 and Th17 activation.15Non-immune intestinal cells such as intestinal epithelial cells IECs Goblet cells Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells ISCs play important roles in regulating the barrier function of the GI tract and the intestinal microbiota has been shown to promote the functions of these cells.
