This procedure yields GF bees with 105 bacteria per gut consisting of an erratic mix of bacterial species versus CV bees with 108 bacteria per gut and consisting primarily of core bee gut species as in naturally inoculated hive bees 19 20.

After 15 d the wet weights of both midgut and ileum were also larger in CV bees than in GF bees and were similar to those of nurse bees collected from hives Fig.

The ILPs are preferentially expressed in the heads ofworker bees whereas InRs and Vg are more highly expressed in abdomens 32.We examined the expression levels of the two ILP genes ilp1 and ilp2 in heads of 7-d-old bees and of two InR genes inR1 and inR2 and one Vg gene in the abdomens of the same bees.

CV bees were obtained by feeding newly emerged bees with homogenates of hindguts of nurse bees from their original hive.

This inoculation method was chosen because it yields CV bees with robust gut communities similar in size and composition to those of normal bees sampled from hives 19 20 however we cannot entirely rule out effects of other components of the homogenized guts on the treatment bees.

Although GF and CV bees showed similar survi- vorship in laboratory experiments CV bees attained greater body weight Fig.

As observed in previous studies all bees gained weight during the first 10 d following emergence 24 but we found that the gain was almost halved for bees deprived of gut microbiota Fig.

The ilp1 and Vg genes were expressed 5.8 and 4.9 times higher in CV than in GF bees respectively and ilp2 and inR1 also increased expression in CV bees Fig.
