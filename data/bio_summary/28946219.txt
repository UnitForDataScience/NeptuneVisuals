in spiteof their relative abundance in mate tea flavonol metabolites only comprised 0.18 of the total urinary metabolites pointing to a very low bioavailability of these flavonoids in contrast to hydroxycinnamic acids.it has to be noted that no diacylquinic acids were identified in urine or plasma samples in spite of the high amounts of these compounds in mate tea specially dicaffeoylquinic acids .in conclusion the total amount of metabolites derived from hy- droxycinnamates and flavonols in yerba mate that were excreted in the 24 h urine collected after the intake of a single serving of this beverage added up to 149.6 mmol  corresponding to 13.4 of the 1118 mmol polyphenols consumed.discussionthe health properties associated with yerba mate mainly related to its high phenolic content point to the importance of advancing knowledge on the bioavailability of mate polyphenols in humans and in particular of identifying the circulating metabolites with potential biological activity.although yerba mate is extensively consumed mostly in latin america the bioavailability of mate polyphenols had not been pre- viously addressed.

flavonol metabolites were among the least abundant of all the identified plasma metabolites cmax 12 nm showing kinetics matching colonic formation tmax 4 h.although hydroxyphenylpropionic hydroxyphenylacetic and hy- droxybenzoic acids metabolites were also detected in plasma no dif- ferences were observed in their concentration during the 12 h bloodmostly caffeoylquinic acids and only minor amounts of feruloylquinic acids  it can be hypothesized that part of the excreted fer- uloylquinic acids result from phase ii metabolism i.e.

thus reduced forms of hydroxycinnamic acids dihydrohydroxycinnamic acids mainly as the phase ii conjugated metabolites formed after absorption in the colon were the predominant metabolites in plasma and urine underlying the importance of the microbiota on the metabolism of hydroxycinnamic compounds.however direct absorption of hydroxycinnamate esters takes place in the small intestine as confirmed by the presence of caffeoylquinic feruloylquinic and coumaroylquinic acids in urine peaking at short times after mate intake 2-4 h yet in low proportion compared to other excreted metabolites 1.6 of the total phenolic derivatives in urine.

the fact that the main intestinal metabolites quanti- fied in plasma were sulfated and glucuronidated caffeic and ferulic acids supports the prevalent intestinal absorption of hydroxycinnamic acids over hydroxycinnamate esters.as mentioned above part of the ferulic acid metabolites wouldderive from the hydrolysis of feruloylquinic and caffeoylferuloylquinic acids present in yerba mate but most came from the methylation of caffeic acid by comt considering the relative ratio caffeicferulic acids derivatives in mate compared to biological samples.hydroxycinnamates caffeoyl- feruloyl- and coumaroylquinic acids hydroxycinnamic acids their phase ii derivatives along withcaffeoylquinic lactones quickly tmax 0.6-2.1 h reached plasma cmax 11-37 nm and were mainly excreted in urine between 2-4 h after mate ingestion accounting for 13.5 of the metabolites excreted in urine after yerba mate consumption.

urine samples were collected in 24 h urine collection containers containing 5 mg of ascorbic acid atdifferent time intervals t  -2 to 0 0-2 2-5 5-8 8-12 12-24 haliquoted and frozen at -20 degc until analysis.extraction of phenolic metabolites from biological samplesa liquid-liquid extraction and protein precipitation with acetonitrile and methanol was used to isolate metabolites from plasma following the procedure described by with some modifications.

due to the lack of standards for some phase ii metabolites they were tentatively quantified using the calibration curves corresponding to their phenolic precursors.thus 5-caffeoylquinic acid was used to quantify mono-hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives caffeic ferulic dihydrocaffeic dihy- droferulic and dihydrocoumaric acids were used to quantify their re- spective free hydroxycinnamic acids and phase ii metabolites and quercetin to quantify phase ii derivatives of flavonols.

the identification of phase ii metabolites was based on previous studies carried out using coffee with similar phenoliccomposition .table 2lc-qtof identification of hydroxycinnamate esters and flavonol metabolites detected in plasma p and urine u samples obtained after the ingestion of yerba mate.to the best of our knowledge a new group of reduced forms re- sulting from the microbial metabolism of hydroxycinnamates namely dihydrohydroxycinnamoylquinic acids had not been described before.

results represent mean - standard deviation n  12. gluc glucuronide sulf sulfate.quantification of plasma metabolites and nutrikinetic parametersof the 45 metabolites identified after mate consumption 31 were detected in plasma although only 16 showed levels above limit of quantification.

caffeic acid 3- sulfate and ferulic acid 4-sulfate were the most abundant hydro- xycinnamic acids with urinary excretions as high as 4.8 and 8.1 mmol in 24 h urine respectively .all these metabolites were preferentially excreted between 2 and 4 h after mate intake in total amounting to 20.12 mmol in 24 h 13.4 of the total metabolites excreted.

finally excretion of dihydrocoumaric acid and its sulfated and glucuronidated metabolites amounted to 10.02 mmol in 24 h in accordance with the lower presence of coumaroylquinic acids in the yerba mate infusion.it is worth noting that sulfation was the predominant phase iitransformation of reduced hydroxycinnamic acids since total excretion of sulfated metabolites amounted to 72.26 mmol in contrast withtable 4metabolites excreted in urine from 0 to 24 h by healthy volunteers after consumption of yerba mate.4-methoxy-3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid0.172 - 0.040 0.134 - 0.044 0.152 - 0.0390.241 - 0.0310.552 - 0.0630.237 - 0.0311.488 - 0.2483-hydroxyphenylacetic acid0.256 - 0.046 0.164 - 0.214 0.317 - 0.0600.359 - 0.0670.761 - 0.1480.387 - 0.0702.244 - 0.605protocatechuic acid0.065 - 0.023 0.034 - 0.008 0.035 - 0.0090.041 - 0.0060.059 - 0.0090.057 - 0.0080.291 - 0.063vanillic acid0.153 - 0.044 0.072 - 0.015 0.130 - 0.0280.139 - 0.0250.288 - 0.0360.282 - 0.0551.064 - 0.203hydroxybenzoic acid0.046 - 0.012 0.091 - 0.027 0.168 - 0.1010.085 - 0.0110.143 - 0.0190.162 - 0.0390.695 - 0.2084-hydroxyhipuric acidn.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.0.086 - 0.011n.d.0.086 - 0.0113-hydroxyhipuric acidn.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.0.084 - 0.013n.d.0.084 - 0.013floroglucinol0.285 - 0.063 0.122 - 0.030 0.155 - 0.0290.184 - 0.0310.311 - 0.0460.458 - 0.1241.515 - 0.323total other microbial metabolites1.093 - 0.245 0.691 - 0.368 1.510 - 0.4762.842 - 0.6193.269 - 0.6261.802 - 0.40611.207 - 2.747l.q.

in line with this the presence in urine of small amounts of sulfated caffeoylquinic lactone shows the ability of hydroxycinnamate esters to be conjugated by phase ii enzymes.although in relatively low amounts compared to the total excretion of phenolic metabolites 11.77 hydroxycinnamic acids like isoferulic acid together with phase ii metabolites of caffeic ferulic and isoferulic acids were more abundant in urine than the non-metabolized hydro- xycinnamate esters.

thus dihydrocaffeic dihydroferulic and dihydrocoumaric acids and their phase ii metabolites accounted for 63.1 of the total metabolites excreted in urine.

only flavonol metabolites and some hydroxycinnamate esters and hydroxycinnamic acid metabolites were completely excreted within the 24 h after mate intake.

however the results are in line with other studies on the bioavailability of coffee hydroxycinnamates  .in all total excretion of metabolites in urine excluding metabolites which origin was not considered to be exclusively derived from the biotransformation of hydroxycinnamic acids such as hydro- xyphenylacetic hydroxyphenylpropionic and hydroxybenzoic acids resulted in a recovery of just 13.4 of the phenols ingested with yerbamate.
