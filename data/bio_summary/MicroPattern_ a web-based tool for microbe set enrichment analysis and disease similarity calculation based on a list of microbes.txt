For every disease i 39 in total and every microbe j 292 in total we described the wij as the quantitative strength of relationship between them N wij  Eij x Wij x log nj 2Eij Eij  -1 1 represents the changing direction of microbe j in disease i. Eij equals to 1 when microbe j is increased in disease i while Eij equals to -1 when microbe j is decreased in disease i. Wij represents the number of associations of disease i and microbe j. N here is 39 is the number of all disease and nj is the number of diseases associated with microbe j.

In total 47 microbe sets were collected including 37 disease sets where microbes in the same set is associated with the same disease and 10 position sets where microbes in the same set is colonized on the same body position.

Among these sets the size of 36 sets was in the range of 1577 5 sets in the range of 61011 1 set in the range of 11152 2 sets in the range of 16204 and 3sets in the range of 212096 see also 2.

Thus for every disease i it has a vector di of length M M is the number total microbes here is 292.Then we took the cosine similarity value between two vectors di and dj as similarity between disease i and disease j ascosdi d j M 1di m x d j m 3ReferencesSommer F.

Stepwise guideline for running the disease similarity calculating procedure.Diet altering the human gut microbiome which is associated with disease.

We adapted the equation for the calculation of symptoms-based disease similarity to calculate the microbe-based disease similarity.

Thus two disease sets were abandoned due to lack of such specified microbe association.

Moreover with the accumulation of study focus on human microbiome more associations between microbe and disease will be curated and MicroPattern will be improved greatly.Materials and MethodsCollection of microbe sets.

So current microbe sets were collected according to two rules the microbe associated disease and the microbe colonized positions.
