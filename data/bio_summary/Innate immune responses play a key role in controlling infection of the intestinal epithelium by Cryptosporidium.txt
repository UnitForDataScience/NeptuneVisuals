Neonatal mice possess fewer CD103 DCs in the intestinal lamina propria than weaned and adult mice .

In adult mice adoptive transfer of stimulated bone marrow derived DCs in DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice significantly lowered parasite load .

The SCIDbgMN mice died within 16 days of C. parvum infec- tion whereas 100 of SCIDbg mice exposed to the parasite sur- vived .

In a mouse model of malnutrition in which 21-day-old wild-type mice were fed a low protein diet isocaloric chow containing 2 protein before infection and during the entire experiment after infection mice receiving daily gavage of CpG- ODN1668 had less body weight loss and a slightly decreased par- asite burden in the ileum .

Adult mice are much more resistant than neonatal mice to C. parvum infection.

Antibiotic-treated adult mice were still resistant to C. parvum infection whereas germ-free adult mice could be moderately infected .

In our laboratory experimental infec- tion of germ-free neonatal mice and neonatal mice born to antibi- otic-treated mothers unexpectedly revealed no significant difference in terms of parasite load and kinetics of elimination rel-Fig.

A TLR4- mediated response was required for efficient eradication of the infection in a model of biliary cryptosporidiosis in which C. parvum was injected into the gallbladders of adult mice  .

In contrast deficiency of both TLR4 and TLR2 did not result in higher parasite load in the intestine of neonatal mice in a natural model of infection .

We were the first to show in vitro and in vivo in a model of human intestinal xeno- grafts in SCID mice that C. parvum infection of intestinal ECsFig.
