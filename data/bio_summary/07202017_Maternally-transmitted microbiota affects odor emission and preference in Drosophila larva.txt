We also tested the effect of Di2 larvae resulting of control eggs CE or of washed eggs WE or of dechorionated eggs DE either in plain food c or in FoodH3B2 d. We also tested the effect of an extract of crushed larvae CL or crushed adults added in plain food c. Data are shown as box plots representing the 50 median data second and third quartile separated with a small horizontal bar indicating the median value.

The comparison between the two food types for each respective strain and age revealed no difference except in Di2 3d plain food and Cs 6d foodH3B2 vials where acetoin levels dropped compared to Di2 3d foodH3B2 p  0.05 and Cs 6d plain food vials p  0.01 respectively.Microorganisms involved in the dynamic change of acetoin.

a Each individual early third instar larva was given a binary choice between two food patches either impregnated with plain food empty circle and bars or with acetoin-rich food FoodH3B2 filled circle and bars.

We tested the effect of control larvae either on plain food a or on food mixed with 0.02 acetoin FoodH3B2 b.

Larvae derived from control eggs CE showed a very different response according to their exposure larvae raised on plain food were attracted N 50 p  0.015--whereas those raised on foodH3B2 were repulsed N  100 p  0.006--by acetoin-rich food.

At each generation progenitors flies inducing the next generation were kept only two days for egg-laying on the food in order to reduce microorganism transmission see Material and methods.between the two types of lines HIGH larvae were attracted--whereas LOW lines pooled were repulsed--by acetoin-rich food N  50 p  0.033 Figs and .

In this case freshly laid eggs 6 h were dechorionated and individually deposited in a fresh food vial either containing Plain food or FoodH3B2 and kept until early L3 stage for testing.Body extracts whole bodies of fresh anesthetized animals 5 min at -20 degC corresponding to 3 g of washed larvae L1-L3 or 4 g of mixed adults 2-4 day-old were crushed using a sterile grinding glass apparatus in 30 or 40 ml de-ionized sterile water respectively.

In contrast olfactory-defective Orco2 mutant larvae--raisedand tested in similar conditions--showed no preference p  ns Figs and .In the two other experiments we compared the response to food2 ug H3B2 the preferred dose of Di2 larvae originating from manipulated eggs and either raised on plain food Figs and  or on foodH3B2 Figs and .

We tested Di2 larvae bde and anosmic Orco2 mutant larvae c. Each double-sided bar represents the frequency for the first chosen food in the binary choice test.

Our findings fits wellwith the attraction of D. melanogaster larvae to uncharacterized volatiles produced by laboratory food mixed with L. plantarum bacteria.Our data reveals the existence of a relationship between the level of acetoin produced by larvae and to which they are exposed and their behavioral response to this compound.
