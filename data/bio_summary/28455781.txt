the common ground of the named unhealthy states can be attributed to gut dysbiosis characterized by the reduction of microbial rich- ness an increase in enteric pathogens and an elevated level of intestinal mucosal inflammation .an important feature of the fecal microbiota structural imbal- ance of the mrsa-positive group is a significant decrease infig.

the number of otus per sample ranged from 379 to 5714 table s3.all four indicators that assess the alpha-diversity and mi- crobial community richness namely chao1 index p0.001 simpson index p0.049 shannon index p0.015 and number of observed species p0.002 significantly reduced in the mrsa-positive group as compared to the mrsa- negative group table  table s3.distinctive fecal microbial communities associated with mrsa infectionsat the phylum level fig.

for the mrsa-positive group the relative abundances of akkermansia muciniphila bacteroides fragilis bacteroides ovatus bacteroides plebeius bacteroides thetaiotaomicron clostridium ramosum dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides eubacterium rectale faecalibacterium prausnitzii parabacteroides distasonis prevotella stercorea streptococcus lactarius and veillonella dispar exceeded 1. for the mrsa- negative group species with relative abundances of over 1 in- cluded bacteroides eggerthii bacteroides fragilis bacteroides ovatus bacteroides plebeius escherichiashigella dysenteriae escherichia coli eubacterium rectale faecalibacterium prausnitzii klebsiella pneumoniae megamonas rupellensis parabacteroides distasonis and roseburia inulinivorans.significantly more acinetobacter baumannii and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were detected in the mrsa-positive group whereas 17 other species namely bacteroides stercoris bacteroides caccae butyricimonas virosa clostridium clostridioforme clostridium colinum dialister invisus dorea formicigenerans escherichiashigella dysenteriae eubacterium ventriosum faecalibacterium prausnitzii lactobacillus rogosae megamonas rupellensis oscillibacter valericigenes paraprevotella clara phascolarctobacterium faecium roseburia inulinivorans and ruminococcus callidus showed an opposite trend p0.050 table .

revealed that the gut microbiota of colorectal cancer crc patients differed from those of healthy volunteers and the gut microbiota imbalance is characterized by significant depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and increase in vari- ous opportunistic pathogens eg.

the genera acinetobacter and enterococcus were significantly more abundant in the mrsa-positive group whereas barnesiella butyricimonas coprococcus escherichiashigella eubacterium faecalibacterium megamonas oscillibacter phascolarctobacterium roseburia ruminococcus and sutterella were significantly enriched in the mrsa-negativetable 1diversity indices of fecal microbiota communities of the mrsa-positive and mrsa-negative groupsab100 100755025others unclassified verrucomicrobia tenericutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes755025others unclassified dysgonomonas sutterella streptococcus roseburia akkermansia megamonas parabacteroidesescherichiashigella eubacterium veillonella clostridium faecalibacterium enterococcus bacteroides0m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 m9 m10 m11 m12 m13 m14 m15 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c150m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 m9 m10 m11 m12 m13 m14 m15 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15mrsa--positivemrsa--negativemrsa--positivemrsa--negativefig.

both the fecal microbial diversity and com- munity richness were lower in the mrsa-positive group.

in addition faecalibacterium prausnitzii is able to produce a 15 kda anti-inflammatory protein called microbial anti-inflammatory molecule mam which inhibits the nf-kb pathway in intestinal epithelial cells .in summary our study applied the third generation pacbio smrt dna sequencing system and qpcr to characterize the fecal microbiota of mrsa-positive and mrsa-negative in- dividuals n15 for each sample group.

the genera acinetobacter and enterococcus were highly enriched in the mrsa-positive group whereas less short-chain fatty acid scfa-producing bacteria including butyricimonas faecalibacterium roseburia ruminococcus megamonas and phascolarctobacterium were detected in the mrsa-positive group.

compared with the control group a marked decrease in the relative abundance of proteobacteria mean 3.522 versus 12.450 p0.050 was detected in the mrsa-positive group.

moreover fusobacteria and tenericutes were only detected in the mrsa-negative group but not in the mrsa-positive group.

significant more escherichia coli and enterococcus were detected in the mrsa-positive group p0.050 whereas more lactobacillus was found in themrsa-negative group p0.050.

the relative abundances of several genera including barnesiella butyricimonas  faecalibacterium  megamonas  phascolarctobacterium roseburia and ruminococcus decreased in the mrsa-positive group compared with the mrsa-negative group.

yet whether patients with mrsa infections carry specific sig- natures in their fecal microbiota composition has not been deter- mined.
