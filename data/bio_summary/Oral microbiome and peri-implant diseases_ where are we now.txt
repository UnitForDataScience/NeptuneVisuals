Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as penicillin or clindamycin are usually administrated in the pre- and early postoperative period in almost all fields of implant surgery in medicine.89 Dental implants however being partially external devices are under increased risk of bacterial contamination during the whole period of the implant functioning in the oral cavity.10 Late infections represent a significant cause of dental implant failure and they develop most commonly.

Despite a high success rate ranging up to 98 biological complications such as peri- implant mucositis PIM and periimplantitis PI are still possible threats to treatment success.12 PIM describes an inflammatory lesion that resides in the mucosa while PI also affects the supporting bone.34 Inflammatory destruction of the implant-supporting tissues is a result of biofilm formation on the implant surface.

The prevalence of peri- implant infective diseases PIIDs was reported to be up to 80 for PIM and 56 for PI.5 PIID in oral surgery may develop in the early postoperative period as a result of impaired wound healing early infection or after the process of implant integra- tion late infection.6Surgical procedures in the oral cavity are classified as type 2 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.7 Hence to minimize the risk of early infection a prophylactic antibiotic therapy is applied.

Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus auto- immune disorders genetic factors bisphosphonate therapy head and neck radiotherapy chemotherapy smoking and alcohol consumption are the most commonly listed general risk factors for infection.2324 Chronic systemic diseases chemotherapy surgical trauma or bacterial contamination during implant surgery are considered risk factors associated with early implant failures.

These result in impaired healing of the surgically wounded tissues.25-27 Antibiotic prophylaxis as well as preoperative mouth rinse with 0.2 chlorhexidine can reduce the incidence of early failures.2829 Local factors such as dental calculus improper dental fillings and failed endodontic treatment of neighboring teeth increase the risk of implant infection and hence these issues must be resolved prior to any surgical procedure in the oral cavity.30-32Dental implant susceptibility to infection is also caused by the morphology of peri-implant tissues.

While those structures develop during tooth eruption peri-implant tissues form as a result of surgical trauma during wound repair.3637 These fundamental differences in tissue morphogenesis implicate further distinct features of peri-implant tissue morphology.2238 These include the following a lack of periodontal space the scar tissue nature of soft tissues receded blood flow caused by poor vascularity and a deeper sulcus which allows for deeper penetration of bacteria.3940 Thus even a fully integrated dental implant exhibits a space which is more susceptible to bacterial infection than periodontal tissues.The process of biofilm formation on implant surface is comparable to biofilm formation on natural teeth.

Therefore it may also have an impact on implant surface properties obtained during implant manufacturing.

Therefore the problem of biofilm formation around dental implants is still pending regardless of the shape macro- and microfeatures or surface modification.23Bacterial colonization of the surface irregularities starts around 30 minutes after the implant is introduced into the environment of the oral cavity.2057 Initial adhesion begins at locations where bacteria are sheltered from shear forces.4958 Initial attachment of bacteria is driven by hydrophobic electrostatic and van der Waals forces which bring the cells closer to the implant surface coated by AP.

Soft tissues around rough implant surfaces are characterized by greater microvessel density and a higher number of T- and B-cell infiltrate when compared to tissues around smooth implant surfaces.74 Peri-implant mucosa may also present less Langerhans cells and more interstitial cells.75 Release of TNF IL-17 and IL exacerbates the inflammatory response by stimulation of PMNs to produce enzymes ROS and fibroblasts to release MMPs.

An implant that has lost its integrity with the bony tissue requires removal.849697Implant failure may be a result of both mechanical and or biological complications where peri-implant infections represent the latter.9899 Modern dentistry regards implant treatment as a continuous process where regular checkup visits are an absolute requirement for therapeutic success.
