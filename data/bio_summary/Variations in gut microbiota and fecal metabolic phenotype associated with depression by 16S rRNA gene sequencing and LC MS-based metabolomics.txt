However the altered gut microbiota and its effects on metabolic phenotype in the host under depressive con- ditions remain unknown and would be a focal point to interpret the possible mechanisms of depression.Meanwhile regarding the relationship of gut microbiota with the host metabolic phenotype the consequential question of how microbial communities affect the metabolic function can be explored by non-targeted metabolomics.

Recently metabolomics of fecal samples have unraveled that metabolic phenotype changes are correlated with gut microbiota perturbations in the development of diseases such as obesity nonalcoholic fatty liver disease IBS and Crohn'sdisease In the present work fecal metabolic profile of depression was performed and we found the fecal metabolic pro- file of depression model rats were significantly different from those of the normal controls.

However such reports delineating fecal metabolic profiles are scarce and no information is available regarding the changes of fecal metabolic phenotype in depression.

The fold changes for these genera are shown in B.Fecal metabolic profiling of CVS-induced depressionFecal metabolic profiles of CVS treated rats and control animals were acquired by LC-MS.

In summary CVS-induced depression changed the structurecomposition of the gut microbiota disturbed hippocampus catecholamine levels and substantially altered fecal metabolic phenotype.DiscussionAn integrated 16S rRNA gene sequencing and LC-MS based metabolomics approach was performed to explore the impact of CVS-induced depression on the gut microbiota and fecal metabolic phenotype.

Therefore our results further confirmed that the variations in gutmicrobiota and fecal metabolic phenotype associated with the development of depression.Conclusions16S rRNA gene sequencing and LC-MS based metabolomics were combined to assess the effects of CVS-induced depression on the gut microbiota and fecal metabolic phenotype.

To assess the impact of gut microbiota on fecal metabolic phenotype in depressive conditions an integrated approach of 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrome- try UHPLC-MS based metabolomics was performed in chronic variable stress CVS-induced depression rat model.

Meanwhile distinct changes in fecal metabolic phenotype of depressive rats were also found including lower levels of amino acids and fatty acids and higher amounts of bile acids hypoxanthine and stercobilins.
