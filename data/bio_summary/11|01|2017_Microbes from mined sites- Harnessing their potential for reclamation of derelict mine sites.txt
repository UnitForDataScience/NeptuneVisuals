Currently remediation strategies such as revegetation and phytoremediation have been employed predom- inantly in heavy metal-contaminated sites   however more emphasis must be given in understanding the role of plantemicrobiome interactions in mined sites for developing sus- tainable remediation methods.

Thus the occurrence of diverse microbes reported from all the mine sites suggests that these communities can eitherthrive or adapt in extreme conditions.The microbial diversity in these sites is abundant with complex life cycles nutrient uptake and metabolism.

Role of rhizosphere microorganisms in mined site environments.Signalling plantmicrobiome interactions in contaminated mine sitesThe strategies that are followed for remediating the contami- nated sites using plant-microbe interaction signalling are i phy- toremediation which uses the translocation properties of the plants to remediate the sites  and ii rhizoremediation where the root exudates of plants facilitate the growth of microbial community in rhizosphere soil and those microbes growing in nutrient-rich environment in return will degrade the contaminants and environmental pollutants .

Prog- ress towards a fundamental understanding as to how mycorrhizae and associated bacteria influence the vegetation development at polluted sites is still a big challenge.Microbe-assisted revegetation in mine site remediationRevival of a polluted or disturbed site into its original state in order to restore the normal interactions between biotic and abiotic factors of the ecosystem is called 'reclamation' while 'revegetation' is a process of establishing suitable plant species which can survive the odds of all ecological factors and grow faster at the contami- nated sites .

Once the risk assessment and evaluation is performed at the site phytoremediation is the widely adopted strategy however revegetation is also possible by overcoming challenges of soil pH depleted nutrients and heavy metal accumulations in contami- nated sites since the kind of vegetation in these sites is limited to very few species that tolerate extreme conditions.

Future research in mine site microbiology must focus on engineering the microbiomes of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere at mine sites to harness the full potential of microbiota in the rehabilitation of unusedabandoned mine sites.

Yet microorganisms generally remain an undervalued asset in mined sites.

The microbial diversity in derelict mine sites consists of diverse species belonging to four key phyla Proteobacteria Acidobacteria Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.
