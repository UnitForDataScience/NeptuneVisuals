considering the results that can be obtained with such techniques as the genome sequencing and biochemical characterization of whole microbial communities becomes increasingly more feasible the application of cb methods to microbial communities is turning out as a very promising field.metabolic modeling of microbial communitiesin the last years a number of works describing diverse aspects of multi-organism metabolic modeling has testified the growing interest in this field    .

in the face of these advances here we focus on providing an overview of the possibilities and challenges related to the modeling of metabolic interactions within a bacterial community discussing the feasibility and the perspectives of this kind of analysis in the near future.keywords microbial communities metabolic modeling constraint-based modeling metabolic interactions microbiome mcfbametabolic-based interactions and the microbiomethe advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms ngs represents one of the most significant milestones in the field of microbial ecology.

in this sense artificial microbial communities can be designed being geared toward precise and efficient bio-performances and at the same time maintaining the resilience and the complexity of near native microbial communities.

however despite their crucial importance the mechanisms that influence the functioning of microbial communities and their relationship with environmental perturbations are obscure.
