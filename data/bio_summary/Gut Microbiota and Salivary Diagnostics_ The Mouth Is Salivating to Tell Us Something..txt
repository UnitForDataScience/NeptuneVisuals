1.1-8 Mounting data show that for each individual the collective composition of their microbiota microbiome3910 is host-specific and relatively stable over time.411-13Of the different ecosystems of flora that inhabit the human body the gut microbiota system is emerging as the preeminent ''microbial organ'' of study and there is great expectation that by better understanding the complexity of the role of microbiota our micro- biome will become an indispensable and integral part of our personalized healthcare in preventing andor treating diseases more effectively and in a more precise and targeted clinical approach.314-19 Indeed gaining a better understanding of the gut microbiota system may help to enable a revolution in precision medicine20211Bridgewater College Bridgewater Virginia.2ShangPharma Innovation Inc.

Allergies atherosclerosis colorectal cancer diabetes inflammatory bowel disease neuro- logical conditions and obesity are some examples.50-54 An association between aberrant mental states and di- gestive disturbances was described by Hippocrates55 and is the single consistently linked comorbidity reported in the medical literature from ancient times to the present.56 Diet figures prominently in maintaining or al- tering the commensal homeostasis composition of the GI microbiota10145457-59 and the formulation of diets rich in functional medicinal foods food-drugs60 is driv- ing the emergent field of neuroregenerative nutri- tion.6162 Although the mechanistic pathways remain mostly obscure numerous studies show that through re- ciprocal interactions with the gut-brain axis5163-67 the gut microbiome can influence neural development cog- nition and behavior.43465468-70 In turn changes in be- havior can alter the gut microbial composition.43677172 Consuming the Mediterranean diet in particular has been demonstrated to improve the health of patients with various chronic diseases2673-78 presumably by al- tering the gut microbiome2679-83 and can help miti- gate with some degree of efficacy abnormal behavior associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.68 Thus opting to incorporate a tailor-made diet plan in the overall treatment of neurologic conditions including autism and schizophrenia is increasingly common practice.104168717284-86 However for microbiota toplay a clinical role in nutritional interventions for maintaining brain health6887 a reliable diagnostic determination of the gut microbial composition is wanting88-91--hence the focus of this forward-looking review article.Fecal-Derived MicrobiotaThe majority 60 of the bacterial species residing in the GI tract primarily the stomach small intestine and large intestine92 are reported to be unculturable.93 In addition gut microbiota are not readily accessed52 and characterization of intestinal microbiota currently relies on analysis of the microbial composition in patient-derived fecal stool samples9495 using DNA- based culture-independent methods as a surrogate rep- resentation.7193949697 However the method of sample collection laboratory handling analysis bioinformatic processing of the data and other factors can greatly af- fect microbiome study findings.9398-100 When a healthy state of the gut microbiota is altered opportu- nistic bacteria such as Clostridium difficile sometimes referred to as C. diff.

Importantly however the bacte- rial composition of the fecal microbiota was shown to be different from those of salivary and gastric fluid microbiota.112 Furthermore the interindividual vari- ability of fecal microbiota was much higher compared with that of salivary and gastric fluid microbiota as might be expected with the colon habitat being com- pletely different from the other two habitats with re- spect to their biological and ecological features.112 Curiously in a seemingly unconnected relationship the placental microbiome8 is also reported to share similarity with that of the oral cavity and not those of the more proximal vaginal or gut flora.113-116Rapid advances in genome sequencing technologies have given rise to user-friendly commercially avail- able kits with buccal swabs for collecting genomic material.118 It is worth noting the current lack of stan- dards accessible control data and variable results from one commercial provider to another nonetheless our expectation is that standardization and suitable compar- isons of data and results would quickly follow once the practice is adopted and dentists are more fully engaged.

The hope is that such bacterial preparations will be suc- cessful in treating various conditions including C. difficile infection.103105106 The composition of fecal microbiota as a valid surrogate representation of the eubiotic normal gut microbiome system aimed to be reconstituted71103104107108 is also gaining greater scrutiny104109 particularly if antibiotics were taken within 12 months before stool collection.98 Indeed because of resulting alterations in a patient's micro- biome the impact of antibiotics on the life-saving po- tential of powerful new therapeutic approaches including immuno-oncology checkpoint inhibitors and other state-of-the-art immune system modulators is currently a hot topic in medical practice.110111Oral Cavity-Derived MicrobiotaThere is mounting evidence that the spectrum of mi- crobial species living in the mouth is both in diversity and in composition a close representation of the microbiota inhabiting the upper GI tract.

In a study to evaluate the influence of proton pump inhibitors on the luminal microbiota in the GI tract reported by Tsuda et al.112 an analysis of microbial samples takenfrom the oral cavity saliva the stomach gastric fluid and the colon stools of 45 individuals found that the bacteria are similar in overall species richness among the three microbiota irrespective of their differ- ent habitats Fig.

During antibiotic therapy unlike the oral and upper gut microbiomes that resist induced perturba- tion of their eubiotic state the microbiota in the colon habitat are vulnerable98112 and recent exposure to antibiotics is an exclusionary criterion in screening donors for fecal microbiota transplantation.104An evolving alternative to antibiotics for selectively killing odor-causing bacteria in the mouth including pathogenic bacteria that could seed growth in the gut is a technique that exposes the oral cavity to blue light for a short period of time.141-144 The bacterial composi- tions in the human oral and gut microbiomes are closely related to each other.112 Interestingly a corroborative analogy from the agricultural sector comes into play here.

Diabetes is a sys- temic chronic illness intimately associated with periodontal disease.131133153 Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome can lead to periodontitis136153 which pro- motes pathogenic bacterial growth and facilitates dis- semination of oral bacteria systemically.131153 A causative link between oral pathogens and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota as well as inflam- matory changes in various tissues and organs has been demonstrated in mice.154-157 Conversely emerging ev- idence shows that diabetes a chronic disease linked to alterations in the gut microbiome18505254102158159 causes a pathogenic shift in the oral microbiome with increased bone loss and inflammation in the mouth that ultimately give way to periodontal disease.160 Sup- pressing the growth of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity is important in reducing the systemic dis- semination of oral bacteria and crucial in the daily practice of good oral hygiene especially in the manage- ment of diabetes.131153 Oral photo-inactivation is a promising nonobtrusive and nonantibiotic method that may have advantage in this effort.144149161While inconclusive and speculative there are sporadic reports in the literature that imply the chronic oral infec- tion of periodontitis may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease AD and Parkinson's disease PD.162-164 Ele- vated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in sub- jects were observed years before the onset of symptoms in people suffering from AD164165 inferring that there was an increased translocation of bacteria andor bacte- rial toxins from the mouth into the bloodstream.162 An investigative study by Pereira et al.163 identified differ- ences in beta diversity which quantifies community composition similarity between samples and abun- dances of individual bacterial taxa in oral microbiota of PD patients and control subjects.

''147 However the total withdrawal of this class of antibiotics is now as- sociated with a deterioration in animal health including increased diarrhea weight loss and mortality due to Escherichia coli and Lawsonia intracellularis in early postweaning pigs and clostridial necrotic enteritis in broilers.147 To compensate in the hope of providing a means for reducing the superfluous use of such drugs in our food-production chain in general agricultural businesses are investigating oral exposure to blue light as a potential replacement for classical antibiotic prophy- laxis in food animals.148149Leveraging the Oral Microbiome in Diagnosing and Treating DiseaseAlthough the oral cavity is continuously subjected to a barrage of host and environmental insults the oral microbiome remains relatively stable over time in healthy people.122131150151 Given this fact changes in the profile of the oral microbiome may provide cor- relative insight into the onset progression and recur- rence of disease.102118120-122125-129152 For example in a retrospective clinical assessment Zawadzki et al.152 examined the oral environment in different human populations and compared and determined the patho- genicity of the resident oral microbiota linked to health complications in three distinct patient groups.
