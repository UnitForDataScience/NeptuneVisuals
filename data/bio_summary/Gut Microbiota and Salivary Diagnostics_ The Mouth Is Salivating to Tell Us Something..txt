1.1-8 mounting data show that for each individual the collective composition of their microbiota microbiome3910 is host-specific and relatively stable over time.411-13of the different ecosystems of flora that inhabit the human body the gut microbiota system is emerging as the preeminent ''microbial organ'' of study and there is great expectation that by better understanding the complexity of the role of microbiota our micro- biome will become an indispensable and integral part of our personalized healthcare in preventing andor treating diseases more effectively and in a more precise and targeted clinical approach.314-19 indeed gaining a better understanding of the gut microbiota system may help to enable a revolution in precision medicine20211bridgewater college bridgewater virginia.2shangpharma innovation inc. south san francisco california.3phenomatrix inc. natick massachusetts.4department of medicine boston university school of medicine boston massachusetts.

during antibiotic therapy unlike the oral and upper gut microbiomes that resist induced perturba- tion of their eubiotic state the microbiota in the colon habitat are vulnerable98112 and recent exposure to antibiotics is an exclusionary criterion in screening donors for fecal microbiota transplantation.104an evolving alternative to antibiotics for selectively killing odor-causing bacteria in the mouth including pathogenic bacteria that could seed growth in the gut is a technique that exposes the oral cavity to blue light for a short period of time.141-144 the bacterial composi- tions in the human oral and gut microbiomes are closely related to each other.112 interestingly a corroborative analogy from the agricultural sector comes into play here.

2. importantly however the bacte- rial composition of the fecal microbiota was shown to be different from those of salivary and gastric fluid microbiota.112 furthermore the interindividual vari- ability of fecal microbiota was much higher compared with that of salivary and gastric fluid microbiota as might be expected with the colon habitat being com- pletely different from the other two habitats with re- spect to their biological and ecological features.112 curiously in a seemingly unconnected relationship the placental microbiome8 is also reported to share similarity with that of the oral cavity and not those of the more proximal vaginal or gut flora.113-116rapid advances in genome sequencing technologies have given rise to user-friendly commercially avail- able kits with buccal swabs for collecting genomic material.118 it is worth noting the current lack of stan- dards accessible control data and variable results from one commercial provider to another nonetheless our expectation is that standardization and suitable compar- isons of data and results would quickly follow once the practice is adopted and dentists are more fully engaged.

diabetes is a sys- temic chronic illness intimately associated with periodontal disease.131133153 dysbiosis of the oral microbiome can lead to periodontitis136153 which pro- motes pathogenic bacterial growth and facilitates dis- semination of oral bacteria systemically.131153 a causative link between oral pathogens and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota as well as inflam- matory changes in various tissues and organs has been demonstrated in mice.154-157 conversely emerging ev- idence shows that diabetes a chronic disease linked to alterations in the gut microbiome18505254102158159 causes a pathogenic shift in the oral microbiome with increased bone loss and inflammation in the mouth that ultimately give way to periodontal disease.160 sup- pressing the growth of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity is important in reducing the systemic dis- semination of oral bacteria and crucial in the daily practice of good oral hygiene especially in the manage- ment of diabetes.131153 oral photo-inactivation is a promising nonobtrusive and nonantibiotic method that may have advantage in this effort.144149161while inconclusive and speculative there are sporadic reports in the literature that imply the chronic oral infec- tion of periodontitis may be a risk factor for alzheimer's disease ad and parkinson's disease pd.162-164 ele- vated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in sub- jects were observed years before the onset of symptoms in people suffering from ad164165 inferring that there was an increased translocation of bacteria andor bacte- rial toxins from the mouth into the bloodstream.162 an investigative study by pereira et al.163 identified differ- ences in beta diversity which quantifies community composition similarity between samples and abun- dances of individual bacterial taxa in oral microbiota of pd patients and control subjects.

differences in the gut andor oral microbiomes distinguished individuals with ra from healthy con- trols and were used to stratify individuals according to their response to therapy.167 the altered composi- tion of the gut or oral microbiomes in individuals with ra correlated with the prognosis and diagnosis of the disease.167 moreover in two separate and unre- lated double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials168169 aimed to evaluate the benefit of oral probiotic supplements as an adjunct microbial therapeutic intervention the ra patients who received daily capsules of the probiotic lactobacillus casei 01 over a 2-month period had statistically significant im- provements in their disease activity and inflammatory status compared with controls.166168169concluding remarksobesity is an expanding healthcare issue world- wide170171 and is a leading risk factor to a plethora of chronic conditions and diseases associated with dysbio- sis in the oral and gut microbiomes--cardiovascular cancer diabetes periodontitis and ra are principal ex- amples.185059172 although the science exposing how the human microbiome influences the development and maintenance of the human body is still in the em- bryonic stage the existing data show unequivocally that microbiota and our wellbeing are intimately linked.

the hope is that such bacterial preparations will be suc- cessful in treating various conditions including c. difficile infection.103105106 the composition of fecal microbiota as a valid surrogate representation of the eubiotic normal gut microbiome system aimed to be reconstituted71103104107108 is also gaining greater scrutiny104109 particularly if antibiotics were taken within 12 months before stool collection.98 indeed because of resulting alterations in a patient's micro- biome the impact of antibiotics on the life-saving po- tential of powerful new therapeutic approaches including immuno-oncology checkpoint inhibitors and other state-of-the-art immune system modulators is currently a hot topic in medical practice.110111oral cavity-derived microbiotathere is mounting evidence that the spectrum of mi- crobial species living in the mouth is both in diversity and in composition a close representation of the microbiota inhabiting the upper gi tract.

introduction to the special focus issue on the impact of diet on gut microbiota composition and function and future opportu- nities for nutritional modulation of the gut microbiome to improve human health.

environmental chemicals in the air we breathe and extraneous additives in our foods27-29 they play a fundamental role in the induc- tion basic development training and function of our immune system2630-33 and in the process of helping us digest fibrous foods they produce short-chain fatty acids252634 that inhibit inflammation35-37 and affect epi- genetic regulation of gene expression by influencing multiple regulatory mechanisms table 1. importantly these regulatory mechanisms include acetylation of dna-associated histone proteins and methylation of dna.103338-41consequently it should not be surprising that gut dysbiosis also called dysbacteriosis or gut microbial imbalance or maladaptation can profoundly affect our wellbeing42 lead to the manifestation of neuropsy- chiatric symptoms and conditions43-46 and underlie a multitude of immune-related disorders gut-brain- immune axis.47-50 gut dysbiosis may also exacerbate the progression of a number of common and often chronic diseases.

in a study to evaluate the influence of proton pump inhibitors on the luminal microbiota in the gi tract reported by tsuda et al.112 an analysis of microbial samples takenfrom the oral cavity saliva the stomach gastric fluid and the colon stools of 45 individuals found that the bacteria are similar in overall species richness among the three microbiota irrespective of their differ- ent habitats fig.

in general an examination of the oral cavity environment for infectious microbiota could help re- duce surgical complications and also support andor guide the surgical treatment.additional evidence reinforcing similarities between the oral and gut microbiomes is observed in their recip- rocal exchange of bacterial pathogens.
