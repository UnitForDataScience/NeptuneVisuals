The importance of understanding the microbial assemblage of the BE is multifold as iti enables a greater insight into the potential influence of building designs on shaping microbial communities2-4 ii allows the assess- ment of potential health impacts of the baseline BE microbial assem- blage and the detection of opportunistic pathogens within the BE56and iii permits in-depth investigation on how occupants affect the microbiomes of their predominant indoor spaces.7-9With recent advances in culture-independent high-throughput sequencing technology the scientific community is more knowledge- able on the microbiome of the BE and how building and occupant attributes shape the BE microbiome.2-481011 It is now known that the breadth of microbial diversity in indoor air is much greater than previ- ously appreciated.2-46-812-17 In addition these important works have provided novel ways in reinforcing the notion that indoor bioaerosols can be influenced by temporal factors as well as geography tempera- ture humidity airflow rates occupancy outdoor environment venti- lation strategy room type and spatial connectedness.40  c 2017 John Wiley  Sons AS.

Given that bioaerosol research in green buildings is in its infancy a greater understanding on how energy-efficient designs in such buildings change their microbial communities should first involve tightly controlled chamber experi- ments simulating the passive and active designs adopted Table 1 so as to potentially associate specific green building strategies to indoor air microbiome variations.1044 In addition it is envisioned that the ZCB microbiome also includes fungi viruses and parasites as in other BEs.131657 Future characterization of these other microbial domains will provide a more comprehensive assessment of the total ZCB air microbial assemblage.In conclusion our case study characterized the air microbial as- semblage of a single ZCB which appeared to be similar to that of BEs of low to medium occupancy.

Investigating the microbial assemblages of green buildings will further enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between building designs and aerosol microbial communities.

In this case study by employing next-generation sequencing we characterized the microbial assem- blage the terms microbial assemblage and microbiome in this study are hereafter referred to the bacterial and archaeal communities and its dynamics within a ZCB in Hong Kong HK.

In agreement with this microbial community compositions between samples of the same locations mean weighted UniFrac  0.143 were neither significantly more nor less similar that those between rooms mean weighted UniFrac  0.141 MW P  .05 indicating a lack of location-based clustering of microbial assemblages within ZCB during sampling when OTU abundance was considered Table S4.Microbial communities detected in samples that were collected within the same day were more similar in both community member- ship and composition compared to those collected on different days regardless of location Figure 2A and Table S8 and season Figure 2BaTotal all samples included in analysis Outdoor only outdoor samples included in analysis Indoor only indoor samples included in analysis.bNS not significant P  .05.FIGURE 2 Community diversity and clustering of ZCB air microbiome by seasons.

The surrounding landscaping of ZCB dominated with shrubs and trees may have also influenced the ZCB microbial community by shaping the adjacent outdoor microbiome.4748 Whileoccupants were still potential sources of the human-associated taxa in the ZCB as suggested by our SourceTracker analysis the presence of human-associated taxa in the outdoor air may explain the lack of differences in relative abundances of occupant-associated genera be- tween indoor and outdoor areas.122345 Still ZCB occupants may have contributed to the bioaerosol communities by resuspending particles from carpets and floors containing environmental microbes838 or by transporting outdoor microbes into the ZCB indoor space via items of clothing andor shoes.710 In a low- to moderate-occupancy BE such as the ZCB resuspension of environmental taxa from human activity may be a larger contribution by occupants in shaping the BE micro- biome as supposed to the direct shedding of occupant-associated bacteria from skin.10In the ZCB the importance of the outdoors as a microbiome source was evidently greater than that of the skin microbial assem- blage.

Our non-adjacent outdoor air sources represented a collection of outdoor microbial assemblages throughout urban and rural sites around HK12 which may be more different from the ZCB indoor microbial assemblage compared to the adjacent ZCB outdoor microbiome.

Importantly our observations alsoreinforced the notion that local outdoor environments are invaluable in understanding the indoor bioaerosol of a given BE.42 The different proportions derived by the different outdoor sources may also suggest that the bacterial microbiome in HK outdoor air may not be as spa- tially homogenous as appreciated previously49 which is not surprising given that outdoor air bacterial communities can be influenced by local vegetation.474850 While other human microbiome sources may have contributed to indoor microbial communities of different BEs23455152 the low percentage of microbial community within the ZCB with un- identified sources suggests that the contributions of these sources were relatively minor.a-diversity was higher when the ZCB was occupied i.e.

This is in contrast to previous studies where rooms andor space types within a building presented distinguishable microbial communities.1351 Variations in microbial as- semblages among indoor spaces may depend on the spatial relation- ships between different indoor locations within a building.4 The ZCB locations selected for this work have relatively similar room type and function and are highly connected with minimal number of walls and partitions which may explain the lack of location-based differences in indoor bioaerosols.

Whether these considerations will lead to green building de- signs that potentially govern changes in indoor microbial communities is important to microbial community research.
