the air exiting the vent is designed to have a maximum velocity of 2.5 ms. the design of the under-floor air supply distribution different from the ceiling air supply distribution commonly seen in conventional bes and the air return toward the ceiling is aimed to provide good indoor air quality and thermal comfort.

cool air from floor plenum enters the space by means of displacement ventilation method and the air brings the heat and air pollutant from low level to high level through the resulted up- ward convective force.with ventilation system off the windows at opposite sides east and west of the building are manually opened to allow cross- ventilation.

when the zcb is naturally ventilated it provides a minimum air exchange rate of six air changes per hour under the tested condi- tion as described previously21 which is approximately 10-fold higher than when the zcb is mechanically ventilated.in the summer of 2014 the various active designs table 1 were activated in the zcb to cool the air inside the building from the sub- tropical climate of hk.

source-tracking analysis of the zcbindoor microbiomethe microbiome of the adjacent zcb outdoor air represented a major source of the zcb indoor microbial community for both seasons figure 3. the adjacent outdoor and skin microbiomes represented respectively on average 81.2 and 6.0 of the zcb microbiome.even when comparing the skin microbiome source with that of an non- adjacent outdoor air microbiome dataset12 the non-adjacent outdoor air dataset representing 9.4 of zcb indoor microbiome was still a greater source than the skin microbial assemblage.

given that bioaerosol research in green buildings is in its infancy a greater understanding on how energy-efficient designs in such buildings change their microbial communities should first involve tightly controlled chamber experi- ments simulating the passive and active designs adopted table 1 so as to potentially associate specific green building strategies to indoor air microbiome variations.1044 in addition it is envisioned that the zcb microbiome also includes fungi viruses and parasites as in other bes.131657 future characterization of these other microbial domains will provide a more comprehensive assessment of the total zcb air microbial assemblage.in conclusion our case study characterized the air microbial as- semblage of a single zcb which appeared to be similar to that of bes of low to medium occupancy.

system on is a partial mechanical ventilation where fresh air intake with adjustable amount coming from the outdoors is mixed together with the returned indoor air to an air-handling unit for cooling before supplying the inte- riors of the building.

to estimate the relative proportions of the outdoor air and skin bacterial communities on shaping the zcb air microbiome we used sourcetracker analysis29 using the zcb outdoor sample data as a mi- crobiome source and the zcb indoor sample data as the microbiome sink.

the subway air study included ground-level outdoor air microbi- ome data from different locations around hk and was collected at sites approximately 2-18 km away from the zcb.

in the zcb occupants were predominantly seated which may have lowered their effects on the indoor bioaerosol by minimizing the shedding or resuspension of skin microorganisms.93839 there was no significant change in the estimated proportions of adjacent out- door air microbiome inside the zcb between day and night p  .05. approximately 3.3 of the microbiome inside the zcb air could not be accounted for.figure 3 sourcetracker prediction of potential microbiome sources contributing to the zcb indoor microbiome.

importantly our observations alsoreinforced the notion that local outdoor environments are invaluable in understanding the indoor bioaerosol of a given be.42 the different proportions derived by the different outdoor sources may also suggest that the bacterial microbiome in hk outdoor air may not be as spa- tially homogenous as appreciated previously49 which is not surprising given that outdoor air bacterial communities can be influenced by local vegetation.474850 while other human microbiome sources may have contributed to indoor microbial communities of different bes23455152 the low percentage of microbial community within the zcb with un- identified sources suggests that the contributions of these sources were relatively minor.a-diversity was higher when the zcb was occupied i.e.

this was in contrast to a previous indoor air study showing a higher diversity with naturally ventilated rooms3 but was in accordance with an outdoor study in hk showing air microbial com- munities being less diverse in autumn.49 without specific evidence linking the zcb ventilation system to microbiome changes in this case study we attribute the observed community variations to daily differ- ences in the zcb microbiome1749 which is consistent with day-to-day variations being an important factor in driving differentiations in com- munity structure in the zcb.samples collected further apart in days within a season exhib- ited more bioaerosols in some zcb locations.

dispersal in microbes fungi in indoor air are dominated by outdoor air and show dispersal limitation at short distances.

the importance of understanding the microbial assemblage of the be is multifold as iti enables a greater insight into the potential influence of building designs on shaping microbial communities2-4 ii allows the assess- ment of potential health impacts of the baseline be microbial assem- blage and the detection of opportunistic pathogens within the be56and iii permits in-depth investigation on how occupants affect the microbiomes of their predominant indoor spaces.7-9with recent advances in culture-independent high-throughput sequencing technology the scientific community is more knowledge- able on the microbiome of the be and how building and occupant attributes shape the be microbiome.2-481011 it is now known that the breadth of microbial diversity in indoor air is much greater than previ- ously appreciated.2-46-812-17 in addition these important works have provided novel ways in reinforcing the notion that indoor bioaerosols can be influenced by temporal factors as well as geography tempera- ture humidity airflow rates occupancy outdoor environment venti- lation strategy room type and spatial connectedness.40  c 2017 john wiley  sons as.
