This indicates that different gut microbes exert distinct effects on host well-being which is crucial for understating the contribution of gut microbiota to the development of colitis.Combined with the fact that carrageenan is highly unabsorbed afteroral intake  recent exciting advances in dissecting the unique impact of gut microbiota on the development and prevention of colitis prompted us to focus on uncovering the effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota in the context of colitis.

Altogether we provide further proof of the toxic effect of carrageenan in rodent animals and illustrate that different isomers of carrageenan have similar pro-inflammatory effects on the colon.Carrageenans profoundly changed the structure of the gut microbiota in C57BL6J miceGiven the critical role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of co- litis   we next sought to investigate whether intake of carra- geenan induced any changes in the structure of gut microbiota since carrageenan is highly unabsorbed after oral administration  .

Given that carrageenan is unabsorbed after oral administration and also in light of the fact that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of colitis we further investigated the effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing.

p  0.05 versus NC group  p  0.01 versus NC group.and PCoA visualized the relative similarity of gut community compo- sition and illustrated that each group of experimental mice had its own unique structure of gut microbiota C D. Altogether in line with our preliminary data Table S1 these results confirmed the modulatory effects of carrageenans on gut microbiota of C57BL6J Mice.Carrageenans modulated gut microbiota at different taxonomic levelsTo understand what kind of bacteria was affected by intake of carrageenan we analyzed the composition of the intestinal microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels.

Altogether our results corroborate previous studies demonstrating harmful gastro- intestinal effect of carrageenan and from a gut microbiota perspective shed new light into the mechanism by which carrageenan induces colitis in experimental animals.IntroductionCarrageenan is a marine-derived polysaccharide that has been used as a food additive for years  .

Our study adds new data to the literature and from a gut microbiota perspective illustrates that carrageenan-induced colitis shares some similarities with DSS-induced colitis and other in- flammatory diseases in the colon which is especially relevant for comprehending the toxic effect of carrageenan.Recently intake of caffeic acid was found to ameliorate colitis byincreasing the abundance of A. muciniphila in the gut of mice  .

According to  the dosage used in the present study in mice is comparable to a 233 mg daily consumption in a 70 kg human lower than the average daily intake in the USA.ConclusionsAltogether our study corroborates the toxic effect of carrageenan on the colon in experimental C57BL6J mice and provides compelling evidence for the modulatory effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota.

Significantly we validated the proinflammatory effect of carrageenan on the colon in experimental mice and interestingly demonstrated that all isomers of carrageenan could induce colitis with a comparable ac- tivity.During the experiment no remarkable changes in body weight wereobserved Fig.
