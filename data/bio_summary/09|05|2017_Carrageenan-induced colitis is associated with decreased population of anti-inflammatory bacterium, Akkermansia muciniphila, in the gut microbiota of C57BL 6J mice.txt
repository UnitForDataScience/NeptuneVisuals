this indicates that different gut microbes exert distinct effects on host well-being which is crucial for understating the contribution of gut microbiota to the development of colitis.combined with the fact that carrageenan is highly unabsorbed afteroral intake  recent exciting advances in dissecting the unique impact of gut microbiota on the development and prevention of colitis prompted us to focus on uncovering the effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota in the context of colitis.

altogether we provide further proof of the toxic effect of carrageenan in rodent animals and illustrate that different isomers of carrageenan have similar pro-inflammatory effects on the colon.carrageenans profoundly changed the structure of the gut microbiota in c57bl6j micegiven the critical role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of co- litis   we next sought to investigate whether intake of carra- geenan induced any changes in the structure of gut microbiota since carrageenan is highly unabsorbed after oral administration  .

given that carrageenan is unabsorbed after oral administration and also in light of the fact that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of colitis we further investigated the effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing.

altogether our results corroborate previous studies demonstrating harmful gastro- intestinal effect of carrageenan and from a gut microbiota perspective shed new light into the mechanism by which carrageenan induces colitis in experimental animals.introductioncarrageenan is a marine-derived polysaccharide that has been used as a food additive for years  .

however as illustrated by h  e staining dietary intake of carrageenan did disrupt the epithelial layer of the colon and induce colitis in c57bl6j mice a. based on a well- established criterion  the histological score of in- flammation in both proximal and distal colons were calculated b. intriguingly although the three isomers of carrageenan arestructurally identical they share the same capability to induce colitis.

our study adds new data to the literature and from a gut microbiota perspective illustrates that carrageenan-induced colitis shares some similarities with dss-induced colitis and other in- flammatory diseases in the colon which is especially relevant for comprehending the toxic effect of carrageenan.recently intake of caffeic acid was found to ameliorate colitis byincreasing the abundance of a. muciniphila in the gut of mice  .

significantly we validated the proinflammatory effect of carrageenan on the colon in experimental mice and interestingly demonstrated that all isomers of carrageenan could induce colitis with a comparable ac- tivity.during the experiment no remarkable changes in body weight wereobserved fig.

according to  the dosage used in the present study in mice is comparable to a 233 mg daily consumption in a 70 kg human lower than the average daily intake in the usa.conclusionsaltogether our study corroborates the toxic effect of carrageenan on the colon in experimental c57bl6j mice and provides compelling evidence for the modulatory effect of carrageenan on gut microbiota.

besides more prac- tically and more importantly even though a plethora of in vitro cell studies have proposed certain mechanisms underlying carrageenan-in- duced colitis   a significant knowledge gap on how carra- geenan induces colitis in vivo still exists given the super complexity of the gut ecosystem and the extremely low bioavailability of this poly- saccharide.often called the metaorgan gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in virtually all aspects of host physiology  .

but unfortunately although an evolving body of literature supports the removal of carrageenan from the list of gras more detailed studies are warranted to corroborate the harmful effect of carrageenan .

however controversy exists regarding to the safety of carrageenan and accumulating evidence indicates that it could induce colitis in experimental models.

interestingly all isomers of carrageenan were found to induce colitis with a comparable activity.
