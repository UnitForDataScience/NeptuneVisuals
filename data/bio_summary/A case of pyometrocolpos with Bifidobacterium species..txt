However there are several case reports describing Bifidobacterium species causing peritonitis urinary tract infections pulmonary infections septic prosthetic joint arthritis bacteraemia and sepsis e.Case presentationA 4-years old developmentally normal girl child known case of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis on T. Cefixime prophylaxis 2 weeks Corresponding author.

Bifidobacterium species could be considered as non pathogenic bacteria and infections caused by these bacteria are usu- ally overlooked or underestimated as they are part of the normal vaginal and gastrointestinal tract.

Definitive identification requires 16S rRNA sequencing or analysis of metabolic products by gas liquid chromatography .In our case we feel that Bifidobacterium species isolated from the pyometra pus was the sole pathogen and it is the combination of antibiotics as well as drainage of pus that has led to the symp- tomatic relief and recovery of the patient.

There is a close relationship between the losses of genital microbiota and increasing incidence of UTIs hence replenishing it in the form of probiotics may be beneficial e. Even though probiotics can be considered as the single most powerful alternative option under clinical development for treatment of chronic intractable conditions the usage of these probiotics in children and individuals with underlying conditions should be with caution.As seen in our case and other reports from the literature itshould be noted that if isolated from clinically appropriate spec- imen Bifidobacterium species should not be dismissed as a contaminant.

Repeated urine cultures were also sent to rule out any urinary tract infection as the patient was a known case of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and the cul- tures remained sterile.Treatment givenOn admission after the drainage of pus through the hymen patient was started on Inj.

There can be a chance that probiotic was used in the past for this patient for the pre- vention and treatment of urinary tract infection as she is a known case of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis even though we could not elicit any probiotic usage in the past.

Clinical outcome of the patient was good after emergency drainage and antibiotic treatment with Cefoperazone sulbactam and Metronidazole.Keywords Bifidobacterium Probiotics Pyometrocolposc 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To date more than 30 different species of Bifidobacterium has been identified though they differ little in their genetic makeup.
