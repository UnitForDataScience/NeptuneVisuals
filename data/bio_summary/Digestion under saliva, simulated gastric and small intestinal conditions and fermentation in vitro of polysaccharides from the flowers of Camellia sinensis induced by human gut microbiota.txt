Each experiment was repli- cated independently three times.Determination of chemical properties of TFPSThe total carbohydrate content of TFPS was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method with Glc as the standard.30 The reducing sugar content was determined by the DNS method with Glc as the standard.31 The content of protein was deter- mined with bovine serum albumin as the standard according to the reported method.32 The content of uronic acid was determined by the reported method with GalA as the stan- dard33 and the content of sulfate radical was determined with potassium sulfate as the standard according to the reported method.34 The monosaccharides were analyzed by HPLC according to the reported method.35 Digested solution 100 mL was mixed with 0.6 M NaOH 100 mL and the resulting mixture was derivatized with PMP 0.5 M methanol solution 200 mL at 70 degC for 100 min.

The index of observed species can be used to estimate the richness of communities and the Shannon index is usually used to estimate species diversity.43 The complexity of the sample was proportional to the values of observed species and the Shannon index.

The results indicated that human saliva and simulated gastric and intestinal juices had no effect on TFPS while TFPS could be utilized by human fecal microbiota which was proved from the decreased molecular weight and lower content of total or reducing sugars after fermentation under anaerobic conditions.

The present results suggest that TFPS has the potential to be developed as functional foods to modify gut microbiota.IntroductionIncreased interest in gut microbiota has been shown in recent years due to their important roles in human health by interact- ing with host diets.1 It has been reported that gut microbiota is closely related to host physiology nutrition metabolism and immune function such as digestion of food regulation of fat metabolism homeostasis of immune cells stimulation of angiogenesis and adjusting of enteric nerves.23 Changes in gut microbial communities are associated with many intesti- nal disorders such as autism type 2 diabetes and inflamma- tory bowel disease.1 Thus gut microbiota is considered the human body's forgotten organ since it is involved in energy capture and storage as well as in numerous metabolic func- tions like fermentation and absorption of undigested carbo- hydrates.4 Notably a recent study has shown that the relation- ship between the gut microflora and diseases is bidirectionalaCollege of Food Science and Technology Nanjing Agricultural UniversityNanjing 210095 Jiangsu China.

The polysaccharides from the seeds of Plantago asiatica L. and mulberry fruits were not digested by human saliva but degraded in simulated gastric and intestinal juices in vitro.1718 A previous study demon- strated that polysaccharides were biologically active in the human large bowel due to the production of short-chain fatty acids SCFAs.19 Much attention has been focused on the mod- ulating activity of polysaccharides on gut microbiota.Ganoderma lucidum could modulate the microflora compo- sition of mice to prevent obesity primarily due to the presence of high molecular weight polysaccharides 300 kDa20 which is in accordance with the result for laminarin.21Earlier studies have demonstrated that the flower of Camellia sinensis is rich in polysaccharides and tea flower polysaccharides TFPS have been reported to have a variety of bioactivities such as inhibitory effects against a-amylase and a-glucosidase and antioxidant antitumor immunomodula- tory and hypoglycemic activities.1522-24 Furthermore it was found that crude TFPS is composed of mannose Man rham- nose Rha glucose Glc galactose Gal xylose Xyl arabi-nose Ara and fucose Fuc with a molar ratio of 2.68 10.17 11.54 22.04 1.49 49.52 and 2.58 respectively.15 However there are no reports about the digestion characteristics of TFPS and effects of TFPS on the intestinal microbial composition.

The alteration of gut micro- biota due to TFPS fermentation was examined by using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing amplification technique.

The results would provide insights into the degradation of TFPS and its modulatory effect on the microbiota composition in the simu- lated gastrointestinal tract and large bowel.Materials and methodsMaterials and reagentsThe dried tea flowers of Longjing 43 provided by the Department of Tea Science of Zhejiang University Hangzhou China were crushed to fine powder before use.

All other reagents used in the present study were of analytical grade.Preparation of TFPSIn order to remove most of the alcohol soluble fats saponins pigments and other small molecules the powder of tea flowers was treated twice with aqueous 80 ethanol solution vv in a ratio of 1  20 wv at 75 degC for 1 h. The resulting residue was dried and extracted twice with distilled water in a ratio material  water of 1  25 wv at 96 degC for 4 h and the com- bined extract was filtered and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for20 min.

The supernatants were concentrated mixed with a quadruple volume of absolute ethanol and kept overnight.

The resulting precipitates were dissolved in deionized water dia- lyzed over distilled water concentrated and lyophilized affording TFPS.Collection of human salivaThe collection of saliva was carried out according to the reported method25 with some modifications.
