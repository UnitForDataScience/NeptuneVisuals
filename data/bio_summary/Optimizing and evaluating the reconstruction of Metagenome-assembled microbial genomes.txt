However the manipulation of the kelpILlow project did not result in a significant decrease in taxonomic diversity.Assembly evaluationThe 12 contig files 4 projects 3 assemblers were ana- lyzed using QUAST which identified that SPAdes and IDBA provided high contig continuity compared to MetaVelvet that assembled fewer contigs with short contig lengths see Additional file Table S3.Contig continuity was further assessed using contig length length of 1000 contigs from 12 contig files the total number of contigs per assembly and by calculating of proportion of reads assembled 1000 contigs from 12 contig files.

The pro- gram QUAST Quality Assessment for Genome Assem- blies calculates contig continuity by describing both contig length and number of contigs Contig chime- rism is due to random sequence overlap therefore a contig contains sequences from divergent bacteria andcan be removed by tools that assess read coverage like Bowtie While not often recognized changes in spe- cies richness and evenness from raw sequences com- pared with assembled contigs can also be used to assess contig chimerism as assemblers should maintain rich- ness number of taxa identified while increasing even- ness greatest with equal distribution of taxa - In addition a substantial reduction in diversity may indi- cate chimera formation.

We assessed the efficiency of assemblers using statistics that including contig continuity and contig chimerism and the effectiveness of binning tools using genome completeness and taxonomic identification.Results We concluded that SPAdes assembled more contigs 143718 - 124 contigs of longer length N50  1632- 108 bp and incorporated the most sequences sequences-assembled  19.65.

Incorrect assembly draws ambiguous conclusions from the data and reduces the number of annotations  Therefore assembly evaluation is an important step that includes both contig continuity and contig chimerism.

First the assembly quality for the three assemblers IDBA Iterative De Bruijn graph Assembler MetaVelvet METAgenomic-Velvet assembler and SPAdes St. Petersburg genome assembler was assessed using a set of assembly statistics including contig continuity and contig chimerism.

Default kmer sizes were applied for each tool IDBA k min 25 MetaVelvet kmer 31 and SPAdes kmers 21 33 and 55.Assembly evaluationEach assembler IDBA MetaVelvet and SPAdes pro- vides one output contig file for each project therefore providing 12 contig files in total.

We calculated the as- sembly statistics for the 12 contig files using QUAST including N50 length L50 which includes the num- ber of contigs longer than N50 the number of contigs assembled the length of the largest contig and the total length of the assembly.

The resulting information was used to calculate the Margalef richness and Pielou's evenness of the 12 contig files using Primer statistics tool FOCUS was used explicitly for this step as each contig is assigned to bac- terial species based on kmer ratios Contig chimeras will have variable kmer ratios and will remain unidenti- fied by Focus and be removed from further analysis.

The second step for assessing contig chimerism included a comparison of Margalef richness and Pielou's evenness of the 12 contig files against the metagenomic reads.

Therefore based on our data of contig continuity and contig chimerism we selected SPAdes as the optimal assembler.Binning tools evaluationSPAdes assembled contigs for the four projects were binned using two different binning tools GroopM and MetaBat.
