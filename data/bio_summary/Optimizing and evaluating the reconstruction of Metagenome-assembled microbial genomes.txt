however the manipulation of the kelpillow project did not result in a significant decrease in taxonomic diversity.assembly evaluationthe 12 contig files 4 projects 3 assemblers were ana- lyzed using quast which identified that spades and idba provided high contig continuity compared to metavelvet that assembled fewer contigs with short contig lengths see additional file table s3.contig continuity was further assessed using contig length length of 1000 contigs from 12 contig files the total number of contigs per assembly and by calculating of proportion of reads assembled 1000 contigs from 12 contig files.

we assessed the efficiency of assemblers using statistics that including contig continuity and contig chimerism and the effectiveness of binning tools using genome completeness and taxonomic identification.results we concluded that spades assembled more contigs 143718 - 124 contigs of longer length n50  1632- 108 bp and incorporated the most sequences sequences-assembled  19.65. the microbial richness and evenness were maintained across the assembly suggesting low contig chimeras.

the pro- gram quast quality assessment for genome assem- blies calculates contig continuity by describing both contig length and number of contigs contig chime- rism is due to random sequence overlap therefore a contig contains sequences from divergent bacteria andcan be removed by tools that assess read coverage like bowtie while not often recognized changes in spe- cies richness and evenness from raw sequences com- pared with assembled contigs can also be used to assess contig chimerism as assemblers should maintain rich- ness number of taxa identified while increasing even- ness greatest with equal distribution of taxa - in addition a substantial reduction in diversity may indi- cate chimera formation.

the phylogeny and genomic content of the novel genomes are investigated using tools such as checkm phylosift phylogenetic analysis of ge- nomes and metagenomes and rast rapid anno- tations using subsystems technology further relatedness to species can also be identified using average nucleotide identity ani that reciprocates the results from dna-dna hybridization experiments to show species relatedness in dna-dna hybridization a 70 cut-off delineates species relatedness and is reflected in the ani calculations as the propor- tion of protein-coding regions that align between two genomes if ani is  95 it represents speciesrelatedness as metagenomics analysis of microbial communities becomes more popular many new genomic tools are being produced to analyze the dna sequences .

the identification of the novel genomes provides support that the metagenome-assembled genomes contain environmen- tally relevant genomic material that is not in the cultured relatives from the databases.discussionwe present a set of evaluation parameters to optimize the workflow to reconstruct metagenome-assembled ge- nomes from environmental microbial communities using assembly evaluation parameters the number of contigs contig length the proportion of reads assembled genus richness evenness and binning evaluation parameters gc content species richness and genome completeness.

high coverage is preferred in diverse com- munities to identify rare species similarly if the di- vergence within the species in the metagenome is small reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes will inherently become difficult due to the inseparability of the microbial genomes it is unresolved how se- quencing characteristics of read length and depth inter- act with the biological variation of the microbial community during the reconstruction of genomes on real metagenomic datasets.the first step in the reconstruction of genomes is as-sembly where short metagenomic reads are joined based on sequence overlap to form longer sequences called contigs.

we predict as the spades assembler fur- ther fragments the reads to different kmer sizes to form contigs the overlapping region between forwards and reverse reads from illumina facilitates the forming of longer contigs more reads were incorporated to contigs for coral environment samples when using spades and for kelp forest samples when using idba which could be due to the bias associated with the algo- rithms in handling the variability within the microbial communities.

we calculated the as- sembly statistics for the 12 contig files using quast including n50 length l50 which includes the num- ber of contigs longer than n50 the number of contigs assembled the length of the largest contig and the total length of the assembly.

contig continuity was assessed using contig length length of 1000 contigs from 12 con- tig files and the total number of contigs per assembly.

communities that have high coverage of phylo- genetically distinct organisms and low taxonomic diversity resulted in better quality genome reconstruction.additional filesabbreviationsani average nucleotide identity anova analysis of variancebwa burrows-wheeler aligner ccom contig clustering of metagenomics checkm check genome completeness coralilhigh coral high diversity coralitlow coral low diversity focus find organisms by composition usage groopm group metagenomes idba iterative de bruijn graph assembler il illumina miseq it ion torrent pgm kelpillow kelp low diversity kelpithigh kelp high diversity metabat metagenome binning with abundance and tetra-nucleotide frequenciesmetavelvet metagenomic-velvet assembler mg-rast metagenomics- rapid annotation using subsystems technology patric pathosystems resource integration center pear paired-end read mergerphylosift phylogenetic analysis of genomes and metagenomesprinseq preprocessing and information of sequence data quast quality assessment for genome assemblies rast rapid annotations using subsystems technology spades st. petersburg genome assemblertcs tetranucleotide correlation searchacknowledgmentswe acknowledge funding from cnpq faperj and capes and permits provided by brazilian federal government license usa national fisheries and wildlife permit for sample collection.

the resulting metagenome-assembled ge- nomes enable linking taxa to function to understand the role of the population in the microbial community and we are currently investigating the role of these genomes in the coral reef environment our pipeline meets the minimum standards for metagenome-assembled genomes in the process novel genomes genes and sequences were identified which can now be deposited in a database to improve future annotation conclusionswe present a set of assembly and binning evaluation parameters to select for an optimized workflow to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes see additional file the set of parameters provides biologically relevant information regarding richness evenness and gc content to help infer the optimal tools for the dataset.

the resulting information was used to calculate the margalef richness and pielou's evenness of the 12 contig files using primer statistics tool focus was used explicitly for this step as each contig is assigned to bac- terial species based on kmer ratios contig chimeras will have variable kmer ratios and will remain unidenti- fied by focus and be removed from further analysis.

contig chimerism was first assessed by calculating the proportion of reads assembled for 1000 contigs from 12 contig files using bowtie .

the overall proportion of reads assembled into theentire assembly for the 12 contig files were also calcu- lated using bowtie.the contigs from the optimal assemblers for each project were selected and uploaded to the contig clustering of metagenomics ccom tool 49 along with their read files in fasta format to perform groopm  and metabat clustering.

therefore based on our data of contig continuity and contig chimerism we selected spades as the optimal assembler.binning tools evaluationspades assembled contigs for the four projects were binned using two different binning tools groopm and metabat.
