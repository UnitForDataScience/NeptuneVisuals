However none of OTUs was significantly higher after ST treatment Figure 4 Figure S1.For the microbial communities present in the rumen mucosal layer referred to as the NSTLCRM and STLCRM groups a total of 16FIGURE 2 Phylum-level comparison of rumen fluid RF microbiota and rumen mucosal RM microbiota between samples from goats without exposure to the antibiotic and samples from goats with antibiotic treatment.

Antibiotic pretreatment weakenedeffects of dietary concentrate on rumen microbiota reconstructionThe effect of dietary concentrate on the rumen microbiota of goats without ST treatment was revealed by a comparison of theFIGURE 4 Maximum likelihood tree of 37 detectable OTUs the relative abundance  1 in at least one of the given samples observed in rumen fluid RF microbiota.

However a comparison of the concentrations of individual SCFAs and TSCFA before the dietary switch baselines revealed that all of them were lower in goats with ST treatment than those in goats without ST treatment Table 1.4  DISCUSSION Recent studies have noted that heterogeneity exists between the fluid and mucosal microbiota of rumen.

In this study the molar percentages of individual SCFAs and the increased percentage of TSCFA upon the shift of diet exhibited no significant changes after ST treatment indi- cating that the composition of the core membersfunctional genes of the rumen microbiota concerning the rumen fermentation are not af- fected by the antibiotic.

Data submissionThe metagenomic data are available at the NCBI under BioProject PRJNA349213.3  RESULTS  Antibiotic induced long-lasting alterations in rumen fluid and mucosal microbiotaThe long-lasting 66 d effect of antibiotic on rumen microbiota was revealed by a comparison of microbial structure between the NSTLC and STLC groups Figures 2 and 3.For the microbial communities present in the rumen fluid referred to as the NSTLCRF and STLCRF groups a total of 14 phyla were found at the phylum level.

Star indicates that significant differences are observed in the t-test p  .05FIGURE 3 Genus-level comparison of rumen fluid RF microbiota and rumen mucosal RM microbiota between samples from goats without exposure to the antibiotic and samples from goats with antibiotic treatment.

In the present study we first investigated the compositional recovery of rumen fluid and mucosal microbiota in goats undergoing a 10-day streptomycin ST treatment.

The effect of dietary concentrate on rumen microbiota of goats with ST treatment was revealed by a comparison of the microbial structurebetween the STLC and STMC groups.

Antibiotic pretreatment decreases the baselines of rumen fermentation productsNo matter whether the goats underwent ST treatment or not the con- centrations of acetate propinate and total SCFA TSCFA were en- hanced after 4-week MC feeding p  .05.
