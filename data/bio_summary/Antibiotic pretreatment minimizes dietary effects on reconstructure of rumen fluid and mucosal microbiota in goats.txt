in this study the molar percentages of individual scfas and the increased percentage of tscfa upon the shift of diet exhibited no significant changes after st treatment indi- cating that the composition of the core membersfunctional genes of the rumen microbiota concerning the rumen fermentation are not af- fected by the antibiotic.

however a comparison of the concentrations of individual scfas and tscfa before the dietary switch baselines revealed that all of them were lower in goats with st treatment than those in goats without st treatment table 1.4  discussion recent studies have noted that heterogeneity exists between the fluid and mucosal microbiota of rumen.

antibiotic pretreatment decreases the baselines of rumen fermentation productsno matter whether the goats underwent st treatment or not the con- centrations of acetate propinate and total scfa tscfa were en- hanced after 4-week mc feeding p  .05. moreover the increased percentages of acetate and tscfa concentrations were nearly the same between the nst and st groups.

the posteffects of antibiotic use on rumen fermentation were estimated by comparing the responses of recovered rumen mi- crobiota to the increase in dietary concentrate with the responses of that without exposure to the antibiotic.

2008. to date the posteffects of antibiotic use on the spatial organization and fermentation function of rumen microbiota have not yet been reported.our previous studies have shown that dietary concentrate pro- motes microbial fermentation and energetic absorption in the goat rumen lu et al.

next the re- sults also showed that the environmental factor that reshaped the rf microbiota during the antibiotic period did not disappear in the dietary modulation period and moreover that it was still the dominant factor in the shaping of rf microbiota in the dietary modulation period.previous studies have indicated that functional redundancy is an important feature for the rumen microbiota and that it allows an al- tered community to perform ecosystem functions equivalent to those of the original community weimer 2015. rumen fermentation pat- terns including acetate-type fermentation the ratio of acetate to pro- pionate is higher than 3 and propionate-type fermentation the ratio of acetate to propionate is lower than 3 reflect the ratio of two major microbial populations i.e.

2015 yan zhang  shen 2014. in the present study we first investigated the compositional recovery of rumen fluid and mucosal microbiota in goats undergoing a 10-day streptomycin st treatment.

the effect of dietary concentrate on rumen microbiota of goats with st treatment was revealed by a comparison of the microbial structurebetween the stlc and stmc groups.

goats and rumen microbiota were given 4 weeks to recover from the antibiotic treatment.
