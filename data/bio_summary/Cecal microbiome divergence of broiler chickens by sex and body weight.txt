Due to the diversity of metabolic path-ways found in predicted metagenome functions we narrowed pathways by selecting carbohydrate energy endocrine system lipid and glycan metabolism about nutrient metabolisms.Identification of bacterial features that discriminate groupsLinear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size LEfSe explored the bacterial features that differentiate bacterial communities of sex or BW groups in the ceca of broiler chickens Segata et al.

This result shows that bacterial communities in chicken ceca vary for sex and their performance.Several bacterial taxa were found to discriminate different sex broiler chicken groups via LEfSe Segata et al.

A variety of factors has been known to in- fluence the GIT microbiome of animals including geno- type Turnbaugh et al.

However this sexual variation in the growth rate may also be associated with differences in the GIT microbiome between sexes because the GIT microbiome has a consider- able effect on nutrient digestion absorption and metabolism in animal's body Turnbaugh et al.
