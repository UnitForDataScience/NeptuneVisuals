stratification of samples was performed using the following parameters uaf and af zones under a or b treatment four groups patient status at day 28 compared to day 1 remission if scorad decreased or was equal between day 1 and day 28 two groups and relapse if scorad increased and treatment a or b.resultsthis study enrolled 60 patients 27 males and 33 females 13-14 years 0.5-63 years diagnosed with moderate form of ad scorad 21-8. at day 1 53 patients presented with a scorad of 11-6 and were included in the study table s1.

one month after the end of the therapeutic treatment day 28 the average evolution of scorad at day 28 compared to day 1 of patients treated with product a was significantly lower than that of the patients treated with product b. a significantly increased level of xanthomonas genus was noticed in the group treated with product a versus product b. on the other hand the level of staphylococcus genus increased between day 1 and day 28 in the group treated with product b but not in the group treated with product a. interestingly these differences were more pronounced for patients in relapse and the associated scorad worsening was less in the group treated with product a versus the group treated with product b.conclusion this study demonstrated that a specific emollient containing a biomass of non- pathogenic bacteria vf grown in a medium containing tsw and associated with a selected carbon source is able to normalize skin microbiota and significantly reduce the number and severity of flare-ups compared with another emollient.keywords skin microbiota atopic dermatitis emollient vitreoscilla filiformis thermal spring water xanthomonas genus introductioncorrespondence sophie seite la roche-posay dermatological laboratories 110 avenue henribarbusse 92600 asnieres france tel 33 1 4688 6544fax 33 1 4688 6688email changes in the composition of microbial communities that colonize skin have been linked to several dermatological diseases in particular atopic dermatitis ad.12 staphylococci colonization or infection has been associated with this pathol- ogy.

group a patients used product a emollient containing lrp-vfb associated with mannose and group b patients used product b another emollient between d1 and d28.abbreviation lrp-vfb la roche-posay-vitreoscilla filiformis biomass.recently the same strategy was used and exactly the same results were obtained after a 4-week treatment period with a topical corticosteroid.18prebiotics were initially defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth andor activity of one or a limited number of bacteria.19 prebiotics that might be included in topically applied skin products also have the potential to support normal skin microbiota maintenance or normalizedysbiosis if it occurs.20 relatively little is known about the benefits of this approach but it has been shown that applying a biomass lysate of the nonpathogenic gram-negative pro- teobacterium vf helped to improve symptoms in patients with atopic or seborrheic dermatitis.121321 it is interesting to note that vfb prepared from organisms grown in a medium enriched with tsw lrp-vfb resulted in more potent stimulation of mrna expression for antimicrobial peptides and other innate immune defense mechanisms through acti- vation of tlr2 in reconstructed epidermis.14 this original biological activity should be mainly explained by the specific structure of the lipid a moiety of the lipopolysaccharide part of vf vf-lps.22in the present study treating the symptoms of ad with an emollient containing lrp-vfb and mannose as a carbon source versus another recommended emollient yielded greater clinical improvement.

interestingly these differences in the microbial landscape were more pronounced for patients in relapse patients with an increased scorad at day 28 versus day 1.discussionusing a high-throughput sequencing approach that targets two portions of the 16s rrna gene v1-v2 as recom- mended by meisel et al17 to study cutaneous bacterial com- munities and dysbiosis associated with the severity of ad and comparing an af skin area to the closest uaf area per patient is a sensitive method to evaluate product efficacy.

seven patients presented with an improvement25 and were excluded from the study.after eliminating those individuals who lacked paired samples scorad and microbiota from both visits 30 paired samples remained and were analyzed for their rela- tion between scorad evolution and microbial community.

before starting the study participants were pretreated for 15 days with drug therapy to improve their scoring atopic dermatitis scorad by at least 25. on day 1 the eligible patients were randomized to either the emollient containing lrp- vfb associated with mannose product a or another emollient product b and were treated twice daily for 1 month.

of particular note the associated scorad in relaps- ing patients worsened less in the group treated with product a 46 versus the group treated with product b 79.at day 28 the microbial landscape of af and uaf areas was similar in both groups but very different between each treatment figure 4. particularly a significantly increased level of xanthomonas genus p-value 2.57e-02 was noticed in the group treated with product a versus prod- uct b figure 5. on the other hand the level of staphylo- coccus genus increased between day 1 and day 28 in the group treated with product b p-value 0.1534 on uaf and p-value 0.2642 on af but was not observed in the group treated with product a p-value 0.7697 on uaf and p-value 0.9729 on af.

only individuals with scorad values between 0 and 40 at day 1 and with at least a reduced scorad score of 25 between day -15 and day 1 were included in the study n53.skin microbiota samples were collected by the samesampler using aseptic techniques as previously described.4 swabs were rubbed firmly for 20 seconds over 1 cm2 skin areas identified as being the most representative of af.

to determine the differences between product a and product b at day 1 and day 28 scorad and delta scorad values were compared using the wilcoxon rank-sum test for paired samples.statistical analysis of sequence datastatistical analysis was performed using r-2.15.

patients were randomized to apply either emollient a or emollient b. they were then instructed to apply their allocated product to their entire body twice daily once in the morning and once in the evening.

they were also instructed not to change their hygiene practices or to apply any other emollient or any drugs including corti- cotherapy or antibiotherapy during the study.patient recruitment and samplingthis double-blind randomized comparative study included 60 patients 27 males and 33 females aged from 6 months to 63 years diagnosed with moderate ad.
