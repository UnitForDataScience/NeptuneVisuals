The microbial communities of AF areas and closest UAF areas for each participant were also similar Figure 2.Microbiota of UAF and AF skin at Day 28One month after the end of the therapeutic treatment Day 28 the average SCORAD of the patients treated with product A was lower than that of the patients treated with product B SCORAD 9.3-6.1 and 13.2-9.6 respectivelyUAFAF0200040006000800010000Streptococcus Xanthomonas Acinetobacter Enhydrobacter Staphylococcus Unassigned Corynebacterium Micrococcus Haemophilus Prevotella Neisseria Klebsiella Granulicatella VeillonellaRothia Prevotella Porphyromonas Actinomyces Peptoniphilus Pseudomonas Paracoccus LeptotrichiaChryseobacterium Kocuria Lactococcus Anaerococcus Unassigned FinegoldiaFigure 2 Average taxonomic composition 30 main genus of the skin microbiota associated with UAF and AF areas in AD patients at Day 1 n34.Abbreviations UAF unaffected AF affected AD atopic dermatitis.Figure 3 SCORAD variation between Day 1 and Day 28 in each treatment group A n26 and B n27.Notes Bold line represents the median value p-value 0.01884.

Group A patients used product A emollient containing LRP-VFB associated with mannose and Group B patients used product B another emollient between D1 and D28.Abbreviation LRP-VFB La Roche-Posay-Vitreoscilla filiformis biomass.recently the same strategy was used and exactly the same results were obtained after a 4-week treatment period with a topical corticosteroid.18Prebiotics were initially defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth andor activity of one or a limited number of bacteria.19 Prebiotics that might be included in topically applied skin products also have the potential to support normal skin microbiota maintenance or normalizedysbiosis if it occurs.20 Relatively little is known about the benefits of this approach but it has been shown that applying a biomass lysate of the nonpathogenic Gram-negative pro- teobacterium Vf helped to improve symptoms in patients with atopic or seborrheic dermatitis.121321 It is interesting to note that VFB prepared from organisms grown in a medium enriched with TSW LRP-VFB resulted in more potent stimulation of mRNA expression for antimicrobial peptides and other innate immune defense mechanisms through acti- vation of TLR2 in reconstructed epidermis.14 This original biological activity should be mainly explained by the specific structure of the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide part of Vf Vf-LPS.22In the present study treating the symptoms of AD with an emollient containing LRP-VFB and mannose as a carbon source versus another recommended emollient yielded greater clinical improvement.

On the other hand the level of Staphylococcus genus increased between Day 1 and Day 28 in the group treated with product B but not in the group treated with product A. Interestingly these differences were more pronounced for patients in relapse and the associated SCORAD worsening was less in the group treated with product A versus the group treated with product B.Conclusion This study demonstrated that a specific emollient containing a biomass of non- pathogenic bacteria Vf grown in a medium containing TSW and associated with a selected carbon source is able to normalize skin microbiota and significantly reduce the number and severity of flare-ups compared with another emollient.Keywords skin microbiota atopic dermatitis emollient Vitreoscilla filiformis thermal spring water Xanthomonas genus IntroductionCorrespondence Sophie Seite La Roche-Posay Dermatological Laboratories 110 Avenue HenriBarbusse 92600 Asnieres France Tel 33 1 4688 6544Fax 33 1 4688 6688Email Changes in the composition of microbial communities that colonize skin have been linked to several dermatological diseases in particular atopic dermatitis AD.12 Staphylococci colonization or infection has been associated with this pathol- ogy.

Nevertheless to distinguish the singular effect of each component of the product it would be necessary to perform other in vivo andor in vitro studies.ConclusionThis study highlights the long-lasting efficacy for managing AD reducing flare-ups and decreasing the flare severity of a moisturizer containing emollient humectant moisturizing or occlusive agents that restore skin barrier function having acceptable cosmetic quality and excellent dermatological tolerance and supplemented with ingredients that provide nutritional supplements to revive natural cutaneous defenses and normalize the cutaneous microbiota.These data suggest that a prebiotic made of a nonliving extract of a specific Gram-negative proteobacterium with an original nontoxic LPS structure ie Vf grown in a con- trolled medium and associated with a selected carbon source mannose onto the skin is a new therapeutic approach to modulate or balance the immune system and would enable normalization of the cutaneous microbiota that could be beneficial in various immune-mediated skin diseases.

Interestingly these differences in the microbial landscape were more pronounced for patients in relapse patients with an increased SCORAD at Day 28 versus Day 1.DiscussionUsing a high-throughput sequencing approach that targets two portions of the 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 as recom- mended by Meisel et al17 to study cutaneous bacterial com- munities and dysbiosis associated with the severity of AD and comparing an AF skin area to the closest UAF area per patient is a sensitive method to evaluate product efficacy.

For the first time this study demonstrated that the topical application of a prebiotic ie nonliving extracts from nonpathogenic bacteria is an interesting therapeutic approach to modu- late or balance the immune system and so normalize the cutaneous microbiota for at least 1 month after the end of a therapeutic treatment.It is known that staphylococci are present on both healthy and AF skin of 90 of patients with AD.

Microbiome of affected and unaf- fected skin of patients with atopic dermatitis before and after emollient treatment.

One month after the end of the therapeutic treatment Day 28 the average evolution of SCORAD at Day 28 compared to Day 1 of patients treated with product A was significantly lower than that of the patients treated with product B.
