the results indicated that both the bacterioplankton and microeukaryote community composition derived from the two lake zones were significantly different.

moreover the results of the phylogenetic structure suggest that deterministic processes played overwhelming roles in driving the assembly of both the bacterioplankton and microeukaryote community in xkb.keywords community composition .

bacterioplankton .

taihu lakeintroductionin freshwater ecosystems microorganisms including bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes have received in- creasing attention as important components of aquatic ecosystems grossart and ploug  newton et al.

it has also been observed that the community structure of bacterioplankton changed in response to the addition of nutrients to the ecosystem zhou et al.

the high nutrient levels could affect the compo- sition of bacterioplankton haukka et al.

however studies evaluating the response of the microeukaryote com- munity assembly and the differences between the community assembly of bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes to changes in the nutrient loading level in freshwater lakes are not available.characterizing the processes that underlie spatial variation in biotic communities across an ecosystem is another major theme of ecological research martiny et al.
