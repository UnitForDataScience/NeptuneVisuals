Significantly higher OTU richness P  0.01 and phylogenetic diversity P  0.05 were found in the bacterioplankton community of MLB than those of the bacterioplankton community of XKB.

The obtained results suggested that the un- measured environmental variables maintained only small ef- fects on the bacterioplankton and microeukaryote community composition in the two lake zones.Next we evaluated the roles of the deterministic and sto- chastic processes on microbial community assembly in fresh- water lakes of different nutrient loading levels.
