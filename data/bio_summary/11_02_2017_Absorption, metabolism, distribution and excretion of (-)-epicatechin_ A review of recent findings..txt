these compounds together with related srems were excreted mainly in the initial 0-4 h collection period with relatively small amounts in urine collected over later time periods  in keeping with the plasma pharmacokinetic profiles a and b.the 5c-rfms were excreted later mainly over the 4-8 h 8-12 h and 12-24 h collection periods  which again is in line with their plasma pharmacokinetic profiles c. as far as 23c-rfms are concerned excretion of 14c-labeled 3-30-hydroxyphenyl hydracrylic acid continued more than 24 h after ingestion of 14cec as did excretion of radiolabeled hippuric acid and 30-hydrox- yhippuric acid .

in epidemiological studies 5-40-hydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate and 5-40-hydroxyphenyl-g- valerolactone-30-o-glucuronide the principal 5c-rfms in both plasma and urine could serve as key biomarkers of e-epicatechin intake.c 2017 published by elsevier ltd.contentsintroduction00pioneering studies and their limitations00initial investigations in human volunteers analysed using authentic e-epicatechin metabolites00bioavailability of flavan-3-ol stereoisomers00bioavailability of 2-14c--epicatechin in humans 00recovery of radioactivity in urine feces and plasma00pharmacokinetics of plasma metabolites00 corresponding author.e-mail address a. crozier.

while this may be explained by interindividual differences in e-epicatechin metabolism coupled with potential matrix effects it is also possible that the compounds reported were metabolites of  -epicatechinwhich would co-chromatograph with their e-epicatechin coun- terparts when analysed by reversed phase hplc.in addition to plasma also analysed urine collected 0-24 h after chocolate intake and the overall excretion of srems was 55.7 mmol which is equivalent to 20.1 of the ingested --epicatechin.

after attaining an overall cmax of 1223 nmoll 1.0 h after 14cec intake the srems declined rapidly with an apparent elimination half-life at12 of 1.9 h  and in almost all instances had disappeared from the circulatory system within 8 h a and b.5c-rfms were also detected in plasma but with different pharmacokinetic profiles and tmax times of 6 h which is charac- teristic of colon-derived products  c. the main ca- tabolites were 5-40ehydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate cmax 272 nmoll and 5-40ehydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30- o-glucuronide cmax 125 nmoll.

the main 5c-rfm 5-40ehydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate was still present in plasma at a concentration of 50 nmoll 24 h after e-epicatechin ingestion c.although 14c-labeled hippuric acids and ring fission metabolites with three two or one carbon side chain 321-rfms were detected in urine see below radioactivity associated with these compounds in plasma was low and this precluded their detection by hplc-rc.

subsequently also identified and quantified an array of --epicatechin metabolites in plasma after the ingestion of 100 g of dark chocolate containing 241 mmol of --epicatechin and 90 mmol of --catechin.

4. pharmacokinetic profiles of the concentration of the srems a --epicatechin metabolites and b methyl-e-epicatechin metabolites and c the 5c-rfms g-valer- olactone and valeric acid metabolites detected in plasma 0e24 h after the ingestion of 207 mmoles of 2-14c--epicatechin by volunteers.

none-the-less based on the very few studies that investigated this question  -epicatechin metabolites seem to be present in the brain of rodents at levels that offer the possibility of being of physiological relevance such as in animal models of alzheimer's disease where the grape flavan-3-ol monomer extract has been shown to improve cognitive function .biomarkers of -epicatechin consumptionit is of note that following e-epicatechin intake by humans colon-derived 5-hydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone and hydrox- yphenylvaleric acid sulfate and glucuronide metabolites began to appear in the circulatory system after 2 h and that 5-40-hydrox- yphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate was still present albeit in lower amounts 22 h later as shown in c. the substantial amounts of these 5c-rfms that appear in urine over the same period  indicate that the plasma pools are being continu- ally turned over being replenished by absorption from the colon which is counter balanced by removal via urinary excretion.

the pharmacokinetic profile is biphasic with maxima at 1 h and 6 h. the total radioactivity in plasma never exceeded 2 of intake although 0.2 of intake presumably derived from colonic absorption was still present 24 h after ingestion.mean total recovery of radioactivity in urine from the 8 volun- teers over the 0-48 h period after ingestion of 14cec was82.5 - 4.7 of intake with individual values ranging from 49.9 to 90.2 .

several of the metabolites including major components such as e-epicatechin-30-o-glucuronide e-epicatechin-30-sul- fate 30-o-methyl-e-epicatechin-7-sulfate 30-o-methyl-e-epi- catechin-5-sulfate but also minor metabolites such as --epicatechin-7-o-glucuronide e-epicatechin-5-sulfate and 30-o-methyl-e-epicatechin-7-o-glucuronide were detected in plasma 30 min after e-epicatechin ingestion with a combined concentration of 854 nmoll .

however after 10 days of chronic supplementation plasma metabolite levels increased substantially and the brain contained trace amounts of free --epicatechin and 363 pmolg of a mixture of an --epicatechin-o-glucuronide presumably -epicatechin-5-o-glucuronideand30-o-methyl- -epi-catechin-5-o-glucuronide .

studies have shown that 2-14ce-epicatechin is absorbed in the small intestine with the 12 structural-related e-epicatechin metabolites srems mainly in the form of e-epicatechin-30-o-glucuronide 30-o-methyl-e-epicatechin-5-sulfate and e-epicatechin- 30-sulfate attaining sub-mmoll peak plasma concentrations cmax 1 h after ingestion.
