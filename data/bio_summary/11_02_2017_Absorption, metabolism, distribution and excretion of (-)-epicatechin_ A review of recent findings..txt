The combined Cmax of the 5C-RFMs was 588 nmoLL and their Tmax was5.8 h. They were retained in the circulatory systems for longer that the SREMs with a AT12 of 5.7 h and also had an area under the curve concentration 3-fold higher than that of the SREMs .

These compounds together with related SREMs were excreted mainly in the initial 0-4 h collection period with relatively small amounts in urine collected over later time periods  in keeping with the plasma pharmacokinetic profiles A and B.The 5C-RFMs were excreted later mainly over the 4-8 h 8-12 h and 12-24 h collection periods  which again is in line with their plasma pharmacokinetic profiles C. As far as 23C-RFMs are concerned excretion of 14C-labeled 3-30-hydroxyphenyl hydracrylic acid continued more than 24 h after ingestion of 14CEC as did excretion of radiolabeled hippuric acid and 30-hydrox- yhippuric acid .

In epidemiological studies 5-40-hydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate and 5-40-hydroxyphenyl-g- valerolactone-30-O-glucuronide the principal 5C-RFMs in both plasma and urine could serve as key biomarkers of e-epicatechin intake.c 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.ContentsIntroduction00Pioneering studies and their limitations00Initial investigations in human volunteers analysed using authentic e-epicatechin metabolites00Bioavailability of flavan-3-ol stereoisomers00Bioavailability of 2-14C--epicatechin in humans 00Recovery of radioactivity in urine feces and plasma00Pharmacokinetics of plasma metabolites00 Corresponding author.E-mail address A.

While this may be explained by interindividual differences in e-epicatechin metabolism coupled with potential matrix effects it is also possible that the compounds reported were metabolites of  -epicatechinwhich would co-chromatograph with their e-epicatechin coun- terparts when analysed by reversed phase HPLC.In addition to plasma also analysed urine collected 0-24 h after chocolate intake and the overall excretion of SREMs was 55.7 mmol which is equivalent to 20.1 of the ingested --epicatechin.

After attaining an overall Cmax of 1223 nmoLL 1.0 h after 14CEC intake the SREMs declined rapidly with an apparent elimination half-life AT12 of 1.9 h  and in almost all instances had disappeared from the circulatory system within 8 h A and B.5C-RFMs were also detected in plasma but with different pharmacokinetic profiles and Tmax times of 6 h which is charac- teristic of colon-derived products  C. The main ca- tabolites were 5-40ehydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate Cmax 272 nmoLL and 5-40ehydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30- O-glucuronide Cmax 125 nmoLL.

Subsequently also identified and quantified an array of --epicatechin metabolites in plasma after the ingestion of 100 g of dark chocolate containing 241 mmol of --epicatechin and 90 mmol of --catechin.

The main 5C-RFM 5-40ehydroxyphenyl-g-valerolactone-30-sulfate was still present in plasma at a concentration of 50 nmoLL 24 h after e-epicatechin ingestion C.Although 14C-labeled hippuric acids and ring fission metabolites with three two or one carbon side chain 321-RFMs were detected in urine see below radioactivity associated with these compounds in plasma was low and this precluded their detection by HPLC-RC.

Pharmacokinetic profiles of the concentration of the SREMs A --epicatechin metabolites and B methyl-e-epicatechin metabolites and C the 5C-RFMs g-valer- olactone and valeric acid metabolites detected in plasma 0e24 h after the ingestion of 207 mmoles of 2-14C--epicatechin by volunteers.
