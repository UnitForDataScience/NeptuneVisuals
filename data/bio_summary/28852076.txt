To our knowledge this is the only available approach implemented as 'DrugBug' tool for the prediction of xenobioticdrug metabolism by metabolic enzymes of human gut microbiota.The human gut harbours more than 100 trillion microbial cells belonging to about 1000 different bacterial spe- cies and hence it constitutes a huge reservoir of metabolic enzymes in the gut capable of showing a vast array of metabolic activities in addition to those carried out by the host enzymes.

Furthermore all the gut bacteria harbouring the identified enzymes were considered as the gut bacteria capable of metabolizing the query molecule.ReferencesGuinane C. M.  Cotter P. D. Role of the gut microbiota in health and chronic gastrointestinal disease understanding a hidden metabolic organ.

The diverse metabolic activities of gut microbes can modulate the host metabolic machinery by interfering with the processes of energy harvesting and extraction of essential nutrients from dietary food and through the metabolism of xenobioticdrug molecules-.Reports on xenobioticdrug metabolism by gut bacteria have been known since last three decades.

The capability of gut bacteria to alter the pharma- cokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of orally administered drugs is especially significant in the field of pharmaceutical research since most of the orally administered drugs are first encountered by gut microbes which can modify the overall activity and toxicity of a drug in the human gastrointestinal tract- -.

OPENReceived 5 April 2017Accepted 7 August 2017 Published xx xx xxxxA novel approach for the prediction of species-specific biotransformation of xenobiotic drug molecules by the human gut microbiotaAshok K. Sharma Shubham K. Jaiswal Nikhil Chaudhary  Vineet K. SharmaThe human gut microbiota is constituted of a diverse group of microbial species harbouring an enormous metabolic potential which can alter the metabolism of orally administered drugs leading to individualpopulation-specific differences in drug responses.

Therefore for most of the orally administered drugs that encounter gut microbiota before their absorption the gut microbial species and the corresponding enzymes capable of their metabolism are largely unknown.

To our knowledge there is no tool or computational approach available to predict the biotransformation of xenobioticdrug in human gut by the metabolic enzymes encoded by the gut bacteria.

Therefore the molecular properties of substrates of all known metabolic enzymes encoded by the gut microbiota can be used to predict the metabolic enzymes and gut bacteria which can potentially carry out the biotransformation of xenobioticdrug molecules-.

To develop an approach for the prediction of metabolic enzymes and gut bacteria which can potentially act on a xenobioticdrug molecule the first step is the construc- tion of a comprehensive dataset of metabolic enzymes and their substrates from all known human gut bacteria.

identi- fied the gut bacterium 'Eggerthella lenta' previously known as Eubacterium lentum capable of reducing active digoxin into inactive dihydrodigoxin and also suggested the potential metabolism by other gut bacterial species.
