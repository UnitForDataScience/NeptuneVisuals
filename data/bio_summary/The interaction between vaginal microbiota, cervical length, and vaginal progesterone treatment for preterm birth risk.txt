The association of the vaginal microbiome at 16 weeks of gestation and risk of preterm birthMajor differences were detected in vaginal microbial communities at 16 weeks in women subsequently delivering early preterm 340 weeks compared those delivering late preterm 340 to 366 weeks or at term370 weeks Fig.

At 18 weeks of gestation L. iners dominance was observed in 100 44 of women who subsequently delivered 34 weeks of gestation compared to 24 521 in women delivering 34 weeks.

Spontaneous preterm birth 37 weeks oc- curred in 34 women 21 mean 326 weeks SD - 36 weeks range 244-366 weeks.

Moreover we show that the insertion of a progesterone pessary for prevention of preterm birth has no adverse impact on vaginal microbial communities.A healthy vaginal microbiome in non-gravid and gravid subjects is often described as being synonymous with low bacterial diversity and Lactobacillus species dominance - Examination of vaginal microbiota at the time of delivery using culture andor microscopy- based techniques has shown that Lactobacillus species dominance is negatively associated with delivery before 37 weeks of gestation odds ratio 0.2 whereas bacterial dysbiosis is positively associated with preterm deliveryodds ratio 2.3 Using similar methodology Donders and colleagues recently reported that a lactobacilli-dominated vaginal microbiome in the first trimester was associated with a 75 lower risk of deliv- ery before 35 weeks of gestation 0.26 95 confidence interval CI 0.12-0.56 compared to women harboring a vaginal microbiome void of Lactobacillus species OR 2.4 95 CI 1.2-4.8 Using culture-independent characterization of vaginal bacterial communities in a high-risk pregnant population we show that the per- ceived benefit of lactobacilli dominance in pregnancy is species specific L. crispatus is advantageous and associ- ated with term delivery whereas L. iners is associated with increased risk of preterm delivery.
