Hence B cells expressing germline-encoded self-reactive VH4-34 antibodies may represent an innate-like B cell population specialized in the containment of commensal bacteria when gut barriers are breached.IntroductIonThe clonal selection theory by Burnet and Talmage postulates that B cells express antibodies on their cell surface allowing negative selection of autoreactive clones during early B cell development while permitting the acti- vation and expansion of specific mature B cells recognizing foreign antigens.Antigen stimulation drives the maturation of naive B cells into memory B cells and plasma cells after the induction of somatic hypermutations SHMs followed by a series of selection steps allowing antibody maturation in ger- minal centers The induction of class-switch re- combination in B cells permits the production of either IgG or IgA class-switched memory B cells that are able to react quickly to a recurrent antigenic challenge thereby providing serological immune protection IgA memory B cells are mostly present in mucosa where they regulate gut microbiota homeostasis and mediate protection against invading pathogens whereas IgG memory B cells areCorrespondence to Eric Meffre Abbreviations used AVY Ala-Val-Tyr BCR B cell receptor CDR complementary determining region dsDNA double-stranded DNA FWR framework region NHS N-glycosylation site SHM somatic hypermutation SLE systemic lupus erythemato- sus TACI transmembrane activator and CAML interactor.generated after systemic antigenic exposure Although IgG and IgA human memory B cells are produced during specific immune chal- lenges both populations express a higher frequency of mul- tispecificpolyreactive and autoreactive antibodies compared with the mature naive B cells from which they originated a feature not anticipated by the clonal selection theory However the proportions of autoreactive clones in naive and memory B cell compartments were not assessed in the same individuals and gene variants have recently been shown to significantly increase the frequency of autoreactive B cells in the naive compartments of asymptomatic healthy donors HDs thereby questioning whether self-reactivity is really enriched in memory B cells Impaired CD27IgM memory responses have been reported in IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient patients but the frequency and numbers of isotype-switched B cells did not appear to be affected by IRAK4 or MYD88 deficiency However the specific Ig repertoire andc 2017 Schickel et al.

What are the origins of VH4-34-expressing CD27IgG B cells in IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient patients VH4-34 gene usage is rare in CD27IgG B cells from HDs because the un- mutated VH4-34 gene encodes self-reactive antibodies rec- ognizing Ii antigens because of the AVY motif in its FWR1 P In addition human VH4-34-expressing B cells have been reported to be anergic a property that does not allow naive B cells to be recruited into B cell follicles In agree- ment with previous studies we found that the majority of the rare VH4-34-expressing IgG B cells from HDs acquired mutations that abolish the AVY motif and thereby eliminateself-reactivity suggesting that anergy may be overcome by VH4-34 B cells The antigens recognized byVH4-34-expressing IgG B cells from HDs remain to be identified to determine whether tolerance is really broken.

Hence the germline-encoded self-reactive VH4-34 antibodies that also recognize Ii carbohydrates expressed on erythrocytes and B cells may have beneficial functions by cross reacting with antigens expressed by com- mensal bacteria that reach the circulation when gut microbi- ota fails to be contained.resuLtsAntigen selection is the major force shaping the IgG and IgA memory B cell compartmentsWe analyzed the reactivity of antibodies expressed by CD27IgG IgG and CD27IgA IgA conventional memory B cells from various HDs which include individuals carrying or not carrying the 1858T PTPN22 allele a poly- morphism that results in the accumulation of autoreactive clones in the peripheral mature naive B cell compartment from which memory B cells originate In healthy individuals who did not carry the 1858T PTPN22 allele we found that the frequency of HEp-2-reactive and polyreactive clones was significantly enriched in IgG B cells isolated from HDs in which they represented on average 42.1 and 23.7 respectively compared with 17-26 and 5-13 in mature naive B cells from the same individuals B and Fig.

S3 F. Altogether although mature naive B cells can display very different proportions of self-reactive clones among subjects we found that IgG and IgA B cells from HDs and patients expressed remarkably similar frequencies of HEp-2-reactive and polyreactive antibodies suggesting that self-reactivity is associated with the development of iso- type-switched memory B cells.IrAK4 and MYd88 deficiency specifically alter the IgG B cell compartmentWe have previously reported that IRAK-4- and MYD88-dependent pathways are essential for the removal of developing autoreactive naive B cells and the establish- ment of central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints However despite the accumula- tion of autoreactive B cells in their naive compartments IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient patients do not suffer from autoimmune manifestations likely because IRAK4- and MYD88-dependent pathways are also essential for autore- active B cell activation To determine whether IRAK4 and MYD88 deficiencies could impact isotype-switched memory B cell development in humans we first examined IgH Igk and Igl light chain gene rep-ertoires of these B cells.

Indeed the 9G4 monoclonal antibody recognizes a FWR1-encoded VH4-34-specific epitope which therefore allows the identification and isolation of rare VH4-34IgG B cells in HDs and patients In agreement with our sequencing results we found increased frequencies of 9G4 B cells in the IgG compart- ment of IRAK4-deficient patients whereas 9G4IgG B cells were scarce in HDs as previously reported B SHM analyses of Ig genes cloned from 9G4IgG B cells isolated from IRAK4-deficient pa- tients showed a decrease in the overall number of mutations in Ig genes C. However most VH4-34 clones from both HDs and patients displayed an unmutated AVY motif which differed with VH4-34 sequences obtained from total IgG B cells and B.This bias which likely results from 9G4 recognition of its germline-encoded FWR1 epi- tope near or overlapping with the AVY sequence preventedFigure 3.

These results confirm previous studies showing increased autoreactivity in the IgG and IgA memory B cell com- partments for which comparisons were made with mature naive B cells from different control subjects However we found that the propor- tion of autoreactive clones does not increase in the memory B cells from subjects who contained increased frequencies ofself-reactive mature naive B cells associated with the presence of 1858T PTPN22 polymorphism or biallelic mutations in the IRAK4 or MYD88 gene This suggests that antigen selection favors specific clones independently of their initial autoreactive frequencies resulting in the accumulation in all individuals of a similar proportion of self-reactive clones in their circulating IgG and IgA conventional B cells.Why is polyreactivityself-reactivity favored in iso- type-switched memory B cells whereas this feature is counterselected during early development of naive B cells Cross-reactivity allows antibodies to bind and neutralize bacteria or viruses of related strains.

We conclude that IRAK4 and MYD88 deficiencies impact the induction but not the selection of SHM in both IgG and IgA B cells and that IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient IgG B cells are en- riched in clones expressing VH4-34-encoded antibodies.VH4-34-encoded antibodies expressed by IrAK4- and MYd88-deficient IgG B cells preferentially bind antigens from commensal bacteriaWe further analyzed the reactivity of peripheral IgG and IgA B cells by testing the ability of their antibodies to bind lysates from specific bacteria and flagellin which is specif- ically recognized by TLR5 an IRAK4MYD88-dependent TLR Bacteria lysates included poten- tially pathogenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as well as commensal bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Entero- bacter cloacae Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile.

We show that the amount of self-reactivity in isotype-switched memory B cells is independent of the frequency of the autoreactive naive B cells from which they originate and that IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient patients show evidence of systemic anti- commensal responses correlating with an increase in VH4-34- encoded self-reactive clones.Both IgG and IgA conventional memory B cells in HDs who do not carry the 1858T PTPN22 allele contained elevated frequencies of polyreactive and autoreactive clones compared with mature naive B cells from the same individu- als.

The IRAK4MYD88 pathway is essential for the gen- eration of CD27IgM memory B cells that are proposed to mediate anti-carbohydrate responses and provide protec- tion against Gram-positive encapsulated bacteria  However the generation of isotype-switched IgG and IgA B cells and their proportion in polyreactiveautoreactive clones seem unaffected in these patients suggesting that the maintenance of isotype-switched memory B cells and the selection of self-reactive antibod- ies in these compartments does not rely on TLRTACI IL-1R family members as their function requires IRAK-4 and MYD88 However both IgG and IgA B cells from IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient patients displayed decreased SHM frequencies compared with HD counterparts revealing that TLRTACIIL-1R play a role for the proper accumulation of SHM.

In contrast the majority ofVH4-34-express- ing IgG B cells from IRAK4- and MYD88-deficient patients display an unmutated AVY motif revealing that these clones are still self-reactive  However these B cells acquired SHMs preferentially targeting CDRssuggest- ing proper antigenic selection like in conventional memory B cells Hence the absence of functional IRAK4 and MYD88 may lead to a break in B cell toler- ance as indicated by the recruitment of autoreactive VH4-34 B cells.
