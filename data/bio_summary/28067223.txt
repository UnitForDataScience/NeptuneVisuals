C57BL6 mice were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center SLAC Chinese Academy of Sciences Rag1 -  - mice were obtained from the Model Animal Research Center Nanjing University Cxcr6gfpgfp and CD45.1 thmice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory Tcrd -  - mice were a gift from Dr Zhinan Yin Nankai University Tlr2 -  - Tlr4 -  - and Tlr9 -  - mice were a gift from Dr Shaobo Su Sun Yat-sen University Il17a -  - mice were a gift from Dr Zhexiong Lian University of Science and Technology of China USTC andJa18 -  - and Cd1d -  - mice were a gift from Dr Li Bai USTC.

Abx-pretreated SPF mice were co-housed with normal mice for an additional 4 weeks to reconstitute their gut bacteria Restored and the hepatic gdT-17 cell numbers were evaluated by FACS n 14 4 for SPF mice n 14 5 for GF mice.

WT and Cd1d -  - mice were co-housed to share the same microbiota but Cd1d -  - mice had a decreased number of hepatic gdT-17 cells with lower prop- ortions of CD27 - CCR6 th cells compared with WT mice similar to the result observed in Abx-treated WT mice 5a.

After antibiotic treatment stopped Abx-treated mice were co-housed with normal mice for 4 weeks to reconstitute commensals.For the PAMP restoration experiment WT mice and Abx-treated mice were intraperitoneally i.p.

The frequency of IL-17A expression by each hepatic gdT-cell subtype n 14 10 7 5 from top to bottom d and the frequency of hepatic gdT cells with the phenotype CD44highCD62L - CD27 - CCR6 th  Annexin-V th7AAD - and Ki67 th n 14 5 per group e from Water-treated mice Abx-treated mice and GF mice were analysed by FACS.

However although different compositions of microbes were induced in the mice 3a there was almost no correlation between the gdT- 17 cell number and the antibiotic type 3b or the bacteria species diversity 3c.Interestingly the mice with low levels of microbes always had small numbers of hepatic gdT-17 cells and the mice with high levels of microbes always had large numbers of hepatic gdT-17 cells 3b.

E. coli was completely deleted in eight groups of mice including the A V AM VN AVM AVN VNM and AVNM groups 4a but some mice without E. coli V AVM and AVN groups still had a comparable level of hepatic gdT-17 cells as normal mice 3b suggesting thatE.

However after depleting commensal microbes Abx-treated mice that started with lower hepatic gdT-cell numbers had only slight increases compared with the baseline of control mice and the numbers was far lower than the levels observed in HFDHFHCD-induced NAFLD mice 8ab.

a WT mice were placed on an HFD for 24 weeks and the hepatic gdT-17 cell number was detected by FACS n 14 4 5. b-d WT mice and Tcrd -  - mice were placed on an HFD for 24 weeks.

An interesting finding was the uncoupling of decreased liver inflammation and increased body weight 9d in Abx-treated mice which was also found by other groups in Il17ra -  - mice and Abx-treated mice.
