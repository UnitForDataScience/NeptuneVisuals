s2c d. altogether these data indicate that supplementing a wd with rs caused substantial shifts in gut microbiota composition and was able to redress some of the aberrancies induced by feeding a wd.feeding resistant starches improved plasma insulin levels and the index of insulin resistance independently of the gut microbiota in c3h miceto directly test the role of the gut microbiota in mediat- ing the metabolic benefits of rs both gf and cvz c3hmice were fed either a control wd or a wd enriched with 10 rs for 8 weeks table we choose to per- form this experiment with c3h mice because unlike the b6 gf c3h mice gained weight similarly to their cvz littermates when fed a wd.

together these findings indicate that the most import- ant clinical improvement induced by dietary rs in humans may occur without a contribution from the gut microbiota bacterial fermentation and gut hormonessuch as glp-1 and pyy.in contrast to our findings and those from human clinical trials reductions in fat mass andor body weight are often observed in rodent rs feeding studies in addition to the improvements in insulin resistance these improvements in adiposity require bacterial fer- mentation in the gut and are connected with increases in gut hormones glp-1 and pyy this dis- crepancy can potentially be explained by a rs dose- dependent effect.

the find- ings reported here demonstrate that some metabolic benefits mediated by dietary rs especially improve- ments in insulin levels occur independently of the gut microbiota and could potentially involve alterations in the bile acid cycle as well as adipose tissue immune modulation in the form of macrophage recruitment and retention.resultsgerm-free c3h mice experienced similar gains in body weight as their conventionalized counterparts when fed a western dietto directly test the role of the gut microbiota in mediat- ing the metabolic benefits of rs we sought to compare the effects of feeding rs to mice with and without a gastrointestinal microbiota.

remarkably the physiological characteristics of this microbiota-independent pathway in c3h mice which include improvements in insulin sensitivity without ef- fects on body weight fat mass and gut hormone levels mirror those observed clinically in humans where im- provement in insulin sensitivity is the primary beneficial outcome of feeding rs with little to no effect on body composition - moreover these rs-mediated im- provements in insulin sensitivity in humans are also ob- served without a concomitant increase in fasting glp-1 levels clearly we cannot exclude the possibility that the improvements in insulin sensitivity conferred by rs consumption occur via different mechanisms in mice versus humans.

such associations are often considered an indication that the gut microbiota medi- ates the health effects of a dietary intervention however when a wd supplemented with rs4 was fed to gf c3h mice plasma insulin levels were signifi- cantly decreased to levels consistent with those observed in their cvz counterparts demonstrating that this rs- mediated metabolic improvement was not dependent on the presence of a gut microbiota fig.

interestingly we observed strong correlations between tca and tcdca concentrations and plasma insulin levels the index of insulin resistance and atm markers q values below 0.0005 for insulin and index of insulin resist- ance additional file  table s3.

the two types of rs fed resistant starch type 2 rs2 and resistant starch type 2 rs4 in this study were selected because they are known to improve host metabolism including insulin resistance yet elicit distinct effects on human gut microbiota composition 1 - in c3h mice supplementation with rs4 improved insulin sensitivity despite having no impact on body weight body weight gain subcutaneous adipose tissue weight and energy intake fig.

insulin and oral glucose tolerance tests would provide additional valuable mechanistic insights.upon observing rs-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity in mice independently of the gut microbiota we explored potential explanations for how the benefi- cial effects of rs may occur without a microbial contri- bution.

the two types of rs preparations rs type 2 and rs type4 selected for this study have both been shown to sig- nificantly impact host metabolism yet each elicits very distinct effects on human gut micro- biota composition we therefore sought to evaluate how two types of rs capable of differentially influencing the gut microbiota impact insulin sensitivity.

c. altogether these findings suggest that rs decrease ex- pression of adipose tissue macrophage markers inde- pendently of the gut microbiota and changes in gut permeability.resistant starches redressed western diet-induced changes in cecal bile acid profiles in both germ-free and conventionalized miceseveral studies report changes in the bile acid ba pool composition of individuals diagnosed as prediabetic or with type 2 diabetes -bas are capable of regulat- ing both insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis as well as reducing the inflammatory activity of macro- phages via nuclear farnesoid x receptor fxr and membrane-bound tgr5 signaling  .

clearly future mechanistic studies are necessary to determine how rs improves insulin re- sistance independently of the gut microbiota.conclusionsin conclusion this study unequivocally demonstrates that the gut microbiota is not required to bring about all the metabolic benefits that arise from rs consumption in mice.

although these benefits likely arise from a multitude of mecha- nisms the gut microbiota is increasingly considered one of the key factors underlying these health benefits - recent research concerning the beneficial effects of short-chain fatty acids scfa which result from bacterial fermentation of non-digestible carbohy- drates such as rs on intestinal barrier function gut pep- tide secretion - and immune function - further strengthen the concept that dietary fibers may exert some of their metabolic benefits via gut bacteria.

these findings are consistent with previous reports - and indi- cate that gf c3h mice are a tractable model in which to study the role of the microbiota in the therapeutic ef- fects of a dietary fiber in the context of obesity.because c3h mice fed a western diet gained weight independently of the gut microbiota we next sought to determine whether c3h mice respond to rs supplemen- tation similarly to b6 mice in which weight gain was gut microbiota-dependent in the presence of a micro- biota.

the gut microbiota is generally assumed to mediate rs- associated health benefits by fermenting rs to scfa which have numerous known effects on host physiology consistent with this view studies in rodents impli- cate bacterial fermentation as a mediator of glp-1 and pyy secretion in bringing about the metabolic benefitsof rs indeed glp-1 and pyy are pleotropic gut- derived hormones that among others affect glucose homeostasis and appetite because microbial re- sponses to fiber and other prebiotics can be highly indi- vidualized determining how--and even if--the gut microbiota contributes to the physiological effects is an important step toward the development of efficient nutritional strategies.
