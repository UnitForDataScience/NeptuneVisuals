Below we highlight some of the key questions and gaps in knowledge.For infantsWhat is the interplay between the development of both the nasal bacterial microbiota and the host immune systemDo transient differences in nasal microbiota based on route of deliveryfeeding overlap with a critical win- dow of development in host immunity resulting in long-term impacts on healthDoes development of nasal microbiota vary across socioeconomic cultural and geographic regionsFor toddlers through teensIdentify the composition of the nasal microbiota for school age prepubertal children as this is a notable gap in current data.What mechanisms drive the changes in nasal bacterial community composition during puberty For older adults in whom studies on nasal microbiota are still surprisingly rare given the increased morbidity andmortality due to respiratory tract infections in this age groupDo changes in the immune system during aging lead to changes in nasal microbiotaIs there a loss of biogeographic variation in the bacte- rial microbiota between the nasal passages and oro- pharynx with agingIs the bacterial composition of URT microbiota asso- ciated with susceptibility to andor severity of res- piratory tract infections A question best addressed through longitudinal studies.What is the impact of menopause on nasal microbiotaIn addition to intriguing questions surrounding the relation- ship between the bacterial microbiota of the human nasalpassages and infection emerging literature also suggests possible connections to other diseases such as asthma and.. chronic rhinosinusitis.

Because infants and older adults experience a high burden of morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract infections we review recent data on the bacterial nasal microbiota composition in health and acute respiratory infection in these age groups.Addresses1 The Forsyth Institute Microbiology Cambridge MA United States2 Department of Oral Medicine Infection and Immunity Harvard School of Dental Medicine Boston MA United States3 Division of Infectious Diseases Boston Children's Hospital HarvardMedical School Boston MA United StatesCorresponding author Lemon Katherine P 4 These authors contributed equally to this work.IntroductionThe nasal passages are an important habitat for clinically relevant pathobionts commensal bacteria that can cause disease in healthy hosts e.g.

Differences in the findings between these three studies  highlight the need for further investigation into the impact of route of delivery on the bacterial microbiota of the nasal passages.Research has also explored whether route of feeding influences early development of microbiota in the nasal passages.

Increasing age also correlated with an increase in the prevalence and relative abundance of Moraxella  Streptococcus correlated with less stable microbiota com- position nasal microbiota showing seasonal variations in temperate climates  which might not extend to healthy children in climates with less seasonal variation Associations of infant nasal bacterial microbiota and respiratory tract infections Infancy and early childhood are characterized by frequent acute respiratory tract infections ARIs mostly due to viruses e.g.

Recent cross-sectional and longi- tudinal studies have explored the hypotheses that the bacterial nasal microbiota composition is impacted by ARIs andor impacts ARIs in terms of susceptibility to clinically apparent infection and severity of disease  .One area of active investigation is whether bacterial nasal microbiota might be associated with susceptibility to and or severity of bronchiolitis which accounts for 18 of infant hospitalizations in the U.S. and is a risk factor for subsequent development of asthma .

Also increased relative abundance of Staphylococcus and Sphingobium was associated with a lower risk of AOM complicating URI .In summary the variation in findings between the above pioneering longitudinal studies  illustrates the critical need for more and larger prospective longitudinal studies of infant nasal microbiota and ARI ideally explor- ing host-microbiota-viral infection interactions and the relationship of these to severity of disease and risk for secondary bacterial infection.Bacterial pathobiont infection and nasal microbiotaColonization with the pathobionts S. pneumoniae H. influenzae and S. aureus is associated with lower levels of bacterial microbiota diversity and decreased levels of commensals indicating a potentially disturbed micro- biota .

Knowledge of molecular mech- anisms coupled with well designed longitudinal micro- biota-based studies will set the field on the path from correlation to causation.The transition to an adult-type nasal microbiotaBased on studies of either children or adults it is evident that the bacterial composition of the nasal microbiota differs between these life stages.

There are statistically significant differences in nostril micro- biota composition with Proteobacteria Moraxella Haemophilus and Neisseria and Firmicutes Streptococcus Dolosigranulum Gemella and Granulicatella overrepre- sented in prepubertal children whereas Actinobacteria Corynebacterium Propionibacterium and Turicella are over- represented in adults .Older adults aging and the bacterial microbiota of the nasal passagesIn comparison with early life there are few studies on the nasal microbiota in older and elderly adults .
