because infants and older adults experience a high burden of morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract infections we review recent data on the bacterial nasal microbiota composition in health and acute respiratory infection in these age groups.addresses1 the forsyth institute microbiology cambridge ma united states2 department of oral medicine infection and immunity harvard school of dental medicine boston ma united states3 division of infectious diseases boston children's hospital harvardmedical school boston ma united statescorresponding author lemon katherine p 4 these authors contributed equally to this work.introductionthe nasal passages are an important habitat for clinically relevant pathobionts commensal bacteria that can cause disease in healthy hosts e.g.

differences in the findings between these three studies  highlight the need for further investigation into the impact of route of delivery on the bacterial microbiota of the nasal passages.research has also explored whether route of feeding influences early development of microbiota in the nasal passages.

increasing age also correlated with an increase in the prevalence and relative abundance of moraxella  streptococcus correlated with less stable microbiota com- position nasal microbiota showing seasonal variations in temperate climates  which might not extend to healthy children in climates with less seasonal variation associations of infant nasal bacterial microbiota and respiratory tract infections infancy and early childhood are characterized by frequent acute respiratory tract infections aris mostly due to viruses e.g.

recent cross-sectional and longi- tudinal studies have explored the hypotheses that the bacterial nasal microbiota composition is impacted by aris andor impacts aris in terms of susceptibility to clinically apparent infection and severity of disease  .one area of active investigation is whether bacterial nasal microbiota might be associated with susceptibility to and or severity of bronchiolitis which accounts for 18 of infant hospitalizations in the u.s. and is a risk factor for subsequent development of asthma .

also increased relative abundance of staphylococcus and sphingobium was associated with a lower risk of aom complicating uri .in summary the variation in findings between the above pioneering longitudinal studies  illustrates the critical need for more and larger prospective longitudinal studies of infant nasal microbiota and ari ideally explor- ing host-microbiota-viral infection interactions and the relationship of these to severity of disease and risk for secondary bacterial infection.bacterial pathobiont infection and nasal microbiotacolonization with the pathobionts s. pneumoniae h. influenzae and s. aureus is associated with lower levels of bacterial microbiota diversity and decreased levels of commensals indicating a potentially disturbed micro- biota .

knowledge of molecular mech- anisms coupled with well designed longitudinal micro- biota-based studies will set the field on the path from correlation to causation.the transition to an adult-type nasal microbiotabased on studies of either children or adults it is evident that the bacterial composition of the nasal microbiota differs between these life stages.

there are statistically significant differences in nostril micro- biota composition with proteobacteria moraxella haemophilus and neisseria and firmicutes streptococcus dolosigranulum gemella and granulicatella overrepre- sented in prepubertal children whereas actinobacteria corynebacterium propionibacterium and turicella are over- represented in adults .older adults aging and the bacterial microbiota of the nasal passagesin comparison with early life there are few studies on the nasal microbiota in older and elderly adults .

a recent cross- sectional study characterizing the nasal and oropharyn- geal bacterial microbiota of canadian nursing home resi- dents between the ages of 68-96 mean 80 years revealed an oropharynx-like composition of the nostril microbiota dominated by non-pneumococcal streptococcus suggesting a transition of the nasal microbiota in aging adults and a loss of microbial topography in the urt .

in a recent finnish case-control study investigating the nasal micro- biota of parkinson's disease pd patients with fre- quency-matched for age and gender healthy controls mean age of healthy controls 64.4 years the most abundant genera in both groups were corynebacterium propionibacterium moraxella staphylococcus and bur- kholderia followed by dolosigranulum pseudomonassimonsiella and streptococcus and others  resembling more the mid-aged adult nasal bacterial microbiota.

in addition to the clear need for further studies of nasal passage microbiota in older adults the implication that host genetics play a lesser role in microbiota composition suggests a role for future microbiota-directed therapies to prevent respiratory tract infection and potentially modu- late other diseases of the respiratory tract.gaps in current knowledge and areas for future researchthe rapid expansion of literature on the composition of the bacterial microbiota of the human nasal passages in health and acute infection reflects a growing recognition of the exciting possibilities for future microbiota-derived and microbiota-targeted approaches for both prevent and treat disease .

modeling such dynamics of healthy infant nasal microbiota is needed for future studies to understand the relation- ship between nasal microbiota and respiratory tract diseases.acknowledgementswe would like to thank markus hilty isabel ferna'ndez escapa and the reviewers for critical comments which improved the manuscript and markus for his encouragement and helpful discussions.

recent research suggests that the microbial communities inhabiting the epithelial surfaces of the nasal passages are a key factor in maintaining a healthy microenvironment by affecting both resistance to pathogens and immunological responses.
