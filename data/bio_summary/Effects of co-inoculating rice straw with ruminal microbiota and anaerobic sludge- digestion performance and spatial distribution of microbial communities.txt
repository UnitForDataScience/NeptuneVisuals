The co-inoculated samples had higherTable 1 The Gompertz model results of the CH4 yield CH4 production potential M maximum daily CH4 production rate Rm and lag phase time ldigestion rates compared to I4 and I5 p  0.05 ranging from43.95 to 44.64 and high hemicellulose and cellulose reduc- tions 50.85-55.03 and 45.57-54.36 separately were observed.Cellulase and xylanase activity assays were used to assess the hydrolytic potential of different inocula Gu et al.

The CH4 yield reached273.64 mLg volatile solid VS at a co-inoculum ratio of 11.

The xylanase and cellulase activities were 198.88-212.88 and 24.51-29.08 UmL in co-inoculated samples re- spectively and were significantly different compared to the results for single inoculum p  0.05.

The microbial compositions were clearly altered after digestion.

Microbial interac- tions involving hydrolytic bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens in the residue were considered to be significantElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article doi3 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.Zhenxing Huang Wenquan Ruan 1 School of Environmental and Civil Engineering Jiangnan University Wuxi 214122 China2 Changzhou Vocational Institute of Engineering Changzhou 213164 China3 Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Anaerobic Biotechnology Wuxi 214122 China4 Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Technology and Material of Water Treatment Suzhou 215009 Chinafor hydrolysis activities and methane production.

The whole anaerobic digestion process includes hydrolysis acidogenesis syntrophic acetogenesis from volatile fatty acids VFAs and methanogenesis.

The recalcitrant structure of rice straw is very resistant to degradation therefore hydrolysis is considered the rate-limiting step during the process Monlau et al.

The microbial populations that are responsible for cooperative syntrophy of VFAs remain to be specifically elucidated.Thus a full ensemble of microbiota with different distribu- tions may be essential for enhancing digestion efficiency.

The mi- crobial communities associated with the solid and liquid frac- tions were investigated by MiSeq sequencing.

The ruminal microbiota RM were obtained by first straining the digesta through two layers of gauze and then centrifuging the slurry at 12000 rmin for 10 min and discarding the superna- tant.
