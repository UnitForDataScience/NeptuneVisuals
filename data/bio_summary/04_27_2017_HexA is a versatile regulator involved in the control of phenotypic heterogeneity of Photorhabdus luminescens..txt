The 1 cells are bioluminescent pigmented and can support nematode growth and development.

The LysR-type regulator HexA has been described as major regulator of this switching pro- cess.

The corresponding pcfABCDEF operon could be identified as the first direct target of HexA since the regulator binds to the pcfA promoter region and thereby blocks expres- sion of the target operon.

The bacteria colonize the upper gut of the nematodes in its infective juvenile IJ stage which search for insect larvae in the soil.

The 1 cells are able to associate with the nematodes and show the characteristic features like bioluminescence pigmentation production of exoenzymes and antibiotics.

The 2 cells lack all these phenotypes .

The synthesis of anthra- quinones is accomplished via the operon antABCDEFGHI which encodes a type II polyketide synthase and several modifying enzymes .

The photopyrones are recognized by the LuxR solo PluR which then activates the pro- moter of the pcfABCDEF Photorhabdus clumping factor PCF operon.

The exact mechanism how HexA can control the various phenotypes remained unclear and DNA-binding of HexA has never been shown.
