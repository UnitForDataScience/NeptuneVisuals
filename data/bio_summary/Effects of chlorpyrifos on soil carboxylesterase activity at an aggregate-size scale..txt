Therefore the capability of soil CbE activity to inactivate chlorpyrifos-oxon via binding of the pesticide to the active site of the enzyme seems to be a generalized phenomenon irrespectively of the soil type and origin of CbE activity.The immediate beneficial impact from the inhibition of CbE activity by chlorpyrifos-oxon could be perceived in the absence of toxicity on soil microorganisms.

pesticide-free aggregates 2 chlorpyrifos-oxon was a more potent CbE inhibitor than chlorpyrifos however no significant differences in the CbE inhibition were found between micro- and macroaggregates and 3 dose-response relationships between CbE activity and chlorpyrifos concentrations revealed the capability of the enzyme to bind chlorpyrifos-oxon which was dependent on the time of exposure.

Chemical hydrolysis is another significant process contributing to the degradation of chlorpyrifos-oxon in soil  so this meta-CPoxon 2mm CPoxon 0.25mmA 120100806040CPO 2mm CPO 0.25mm303-446 uMthe most sensitive reporter for assessing CbE sensitivity to chlorpyrifos oxon 30 min-I500.19 - 0.05 mM for macroaggregates and0.98 - 0.24 mM for microaggregates mean - SE C. Previous studies have demonstrated that sorption of extracellular enzymes to soil organo-mineral complexes may induce changes in the catalytic proper- ties of the enzyme  probably because of conformational changes in the protein among other factors .

Therefore we sampled soil from an organically managed agricultural field to test the following three aims 1 to determine whether the response of CbE activity to chlorpyrifos exposure is aggregate specific2 to assess whether the OP affinity for the active site of CbEs variesdepending on the location of the enzyme in the micro- and macro- aggregates and 3 to validate the potential role of CbE as a molecular sink for OPs which would extend its detoxification capability beyond that observed in soils experimentally treated with earthworms .

After this 30-min incubation period 130 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH6.5 and 10 ml of the substrate 1-NA 1-NB or 4-NPB were added and we determined the residual CbE activity after 1 h of reaction as described above.Dose-response relationship between carboxylesterase activity and chlorpyrifosThe purpose of this toxicity assay was to determine whether the inhibition of soil CbE activity by chlorpyrifos may be considered an efficient mechanisms of OP inactivation.

was used to fit the dose-response curves between the soil CbE activity and concentrations of Cuspider 48E as well as the in vitro inhibition kinetics of CbE activity in the presence of both chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon.

Enzyme activities were determined in these aggregates as described above and chlorpyrifos residues were determined by liquid chromato- graphy in subsamples taken immediately after spiking t0 d and once the experiment ended t10 d.In vitro response of micro- and macroaggregate carboxylesterase activity to chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxonWe also tested whether the affinity of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos- oxon for the active site of CbE was dependent on the aggregate size.

Data are the micromolar concentration of the pesticide that inhibits the enzyme activity by 50 of its initial activity.bolite could be chemically degraded at a higher rate in macroaggre- gates compared with microaggregates.In vitro sensitivity of carboxylesterase activity to chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxonIn order to explore more thoroughly why the magnitude of CbE response to chlorpyrifos varied according to its location in aggregates we performed an in vitro trial with both chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos- oxon.

Although soil enzymes have a microbial origin plant roots and soil fauna contribute to a lesser extent to the enzymatic cocktail of soil .

Enzymes are dispersed in the soil matrix as intracellular living microbial cells resting or dead cells and extracellular free in soil solution or associated to organo-mineral complexes of soil forms  .
