therefore the capability of soil cbe activity to inactivate chlorpyrifos-oxon via binding of the pesticide to the active site of the enzyme seems to be a generalized phenomenon irrespectively of the soil type and origin of cbe activity.the immediate beneficial impact from the inhibition of cbe activity by chlorpyrifos-oxon could be perceived in the absence of toxicity on soil microorganisms.

on the other hand chemical analysis of chlorpyrifos residues in the soils treated with cuspider 48e not only confirmed the nominal concentrations at t0 d 82.5-92.2 agreement but also showed that chlorpyrifos was sig- nificantly degraded during the 30-d period c yielding to a progressive increase of chlorpyrifos-oxon an assumption compatible with the increase of cbe inhibition in almost all treatments between 10 and 30 d a. current data demonstrate that soil cbe activity is a suitable biochemical indicator of op pesticide contamination and in turn its inhibition by these compounds is a significant detoxification mechanism of oxon metabolites.

pesticide-free aggregates 2 chlorpyrifos-oxon was a more potent cbe inhibitor than chlorpyrifos however no significant differences in the cbe inhibition were found between micro- and macroaggregates and 3 dose-response relationships between cbe activity and chlorpyrifos concentrations revealed the capability of the enzyme to bind chlorpyrifos-oxon which was dependent on the time of exposure.

in our toxicity assays dehydrogenase activity was unaffected in the chlorpyrifos-treated macroaggregates compared with the controls p0.30 dunn test although a poor but statistically significant p0.045 j-t trend test linear relationship was observed between this enzyme activity and the pesticide concentration after 30 ded50  dose mg kg-1 wet soil of the pesticide resulting in 50 inhibition of enzyme activity.of treatment b. this finding suggests that this soil had sufficient cbe molecules to bind chlorpyrifos-oxon which is a known toxic metabolite to soil microbes  and reduce consequently its toxicity.

chemical hydrolysis is another significant process contributing to the degradation of chlorpyrifos-oxon in soil  so this meta-cpoxon 2mm cpoxon 0.25mma 120100806040cpo 2mm cpo 0.25mm303-446 umthe most sensitive reporter for assessing cbe sensitivity to chlorpyrifos oxon 30 min-i500.19 - 0.05 mm for macroaggregates and0.98 - 0.24 mm for microaggregates mean - se c. previous studies have demonstrated that sorption of extracellular enzymes to soil organo-mineral complexes may induce changes in the catalytic proper- ties of the enzyme  probably because of conformational changes in the protein among other factors .

after this 30-min incubation period 130 ml of 0.1 m tris-hcl ph6.5 and 10 ml of the substrate 1-na 1-nb or 4-npb were added and we determined the residual cbe activity after 1 h of reaction as described above.dose-response relationship between carboxylesterase activity and chlorpyrifosthe purpose of this toxicity assay was to determine whether the inhibition of soil cbe activity by chlorpyrifos may be considered an efficient mechanisms of op inactivation.

was used to fit the dose-response curves between the soil cbe activity and concentrations of cuspider 48e as well as the in vitro inhibition kinetics of cbe activity in the presence of both chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon.

therefore we sampled soil from an organically managed agricultural field to test the following three aims 1 to determine whether the response of cbe activity to chlorpyrifos exposure is aggregate specific2 to assess whether the op affinity for the active site of cbes variesdepending on the location of the enzyme in the micro- and macro- aggregates and 3 to validate the potential role of cbe as a molecular sink for ops which would extend its detoxification capability beyond that observed in soils experimentally treated with earthworms .

data are the micromolar concentration of the pesticide that inhibits the enzyme activity by 50 of its initial activity.bolite could be chemically degraded at a higher rate in macroaggre- gates compared with microaggregates.in vitro sensitivity of carboxylesterase activity to chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxonin order to explore more thoroughly why the magnitude of cbe response to chlorpyrifos varied according to its location in aggregates we performed an in vitro trial with both chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos- oxon.

enzyme activities were determined in these aggregates as described above and chlorpyrifos residues were determined by liquid chromato- graphy in subsamples taken immediately after spiking t0 d and once the experiment ended t10 d.in vitro response of micro- and macroaggregate carboxylesterase activity to chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxonwe also tested whether the affinity of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos- oxon for the active site of cbe was dependent on the aggregate size.

although soil enzymes have a microbial origin plant roots and soil fauna contribute to a lesser extent to the enzymatic cocktail of soil .

enzymes are dispersed in the soil matrix as intracellular living microbial cells resting or dead cells and extracellular free in soil solution or associated to organo-mineral complexes of soil forms  .

taken together these results suggest that environmental risk assessments of op-polluted soils should consider the fractionation of soil in aggregates of different size to measure the cbe activity and other potential soil enzyme activities.introductionpesticides are still necessary to combat agricultural pests despite the introduction of environmentally friendly measures such as inte- grated pest management programs and organic farming which reduce their consumption  .

taken together our findings support recommendations to include cbe activity in the battery of soil enzyme activities commonly used to assess the deteriora- tion of soil quality due to pesticide input particularly ops.acknowledgementsthis study was funded by the spanish ministerio de economia y competitividad projects no.

nevertheless further studies are needed to better understand the role of these esterases in microbial foraging  as well as to determine its effectiveness as a biomarker of op exposure in field conditions and what ecological implications come from its inhibition at long-term pesticide exposure.conclusionsthis study set out to test the hypothesis that op pesticides such as chlorpyrifos inhibit cbe activity depending on the size of soil aggre- gates.
