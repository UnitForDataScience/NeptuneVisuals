We propose that women with this BVAB1-dominated subtype may have chronic genital inflam- mation due to persistent BV which may place them at a particularly high risk for HIV infection.KEYWORDS 16S RNA HIV susceptibility HIV target cells female genital tract microbiome inflammation vaginal microbiomedolescent females and young women particularly in sub-Saharan Africa are at an extreme risk for adverse sexual and reproductive outcomes.

Apart from sociobe- havioral factors genital inflammation is a major factor associated with these outcomes  and women with genital inflammation have a 3-fold-higher risk of later human immunodeficiency virus HIV acquisition.

We identify several novel taxa associated with genital inflammation and demonstrate that women with Nugent scores of 9 and high levels of BVAB1 are more likely to have persistent BV and high levels of genital inflammation which may place them at an increased risk of HIV infection.

S3 suggesting that the mechanisms by which microbiota increase HIV susceptibility may be related to epithelial barrier integrity rather than HIV target cell availability.DISCUSSIONIn young South African women the genital microbiota is an important predictor of genital inflammation.
