The same effect was evident also in high fat fed rats treated with HU16 spores while those that had received HU16 cells exhibited a glucose response to insulin very similar to that of low fat fed ratsand were therefore protected by the diet-induced insulin resistance Figure 1.Since only cell-treated rats showed an improvement in glucose homeostasis compared to high fat fed rats the dietary treatment was continued up to 8 weeks only for low fat-fed Group 1 high fat-fed Group 2 and high fat-fed rats receiving B. indicus cells Group 3.Cells of Bacillus indicus HU16 did not affect obesity markersHigh fat dietary consumption sustained the development of diet-induced obesity as shown by 1 the significant increase in body weight and body lipids with a concomitant decrease in body water Table 3 2 the altered plasma lipid profile with a significant increase in triglycerides cholesterol and NEFA Table 4 and 3 the increased deposition of triglycerides in the liver Table 4.

Oxidative stress was enhanced by eight weeks of high fat feeding in whole liver tissue and at the mitochondrial level Table 4 but in this case the treatment of high fat fed rats with 1x1010 cells of B. indicus HU16 was protective Table 4.Eight weeks of treatment with HU16 cells did not affect the gut microbiota of high fat-fed ratsThe majority of the samples from high fat fed animals treated Group 3 circles or not treated Group 2 diamonds with HU16 cells clustered together while samples from two rats of each group were arranged separately Figure 3.

Hepatic mitochondria isolated from rats fed a high fat diet showed a high degree of oxidative stress while in rats fed a high fat diet and supplemented with bacteria the degree of oxidative stress was found to be identical to that of rats fed low fat diet thus suggesting that bacterial supplementation exerts a protective role also on mitochondria.It is well established that the diet is a main factor involved in shaping the microbial composition of the gut De Filippo et al.

The composition of the two diets is shown in Table 1.Rats fed a high fat diet were subdivided into three groups each composed of 6 rats receiving each day by oral gavage 1 ml of a 10 sucrose solution alone Group 2 or containing 1x1010 cells Group 3 or 1x1010 spores Group 4 of B. indicus HU16 Table 2.During the treatments body weight food and water intake were monitored daily.

The Mann- Whitney U-test was applied to the PCA scores in order to evaluate the effect of the oral administration of a daily dose of 1x1010 cells of B. indicus HU16 on gut microbiota of rats under a high fat diet.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the oral administration of HU16 cells did not significantly affect the gut microbiota of high fat-fed rats suggesting that the observed beneficial effects are not due to a reshaping of the gut microbiota but rather to metabolites produced by HU16 cells.Keywords insulin resistance metabolic inflammation Bacillus indicus HU16IntroductionDiet plays an important role in the aetiology and prevention of the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome O'Keefe et al.

Parallel groups of animals under the same diet regimen also received a daily dose of 1x1010 cells or spores of B. indicus HU16.

In both tests the treatment with 1x1010 cells of B. indicus HU16 was protective against the development of insulin resistance Figure 2.Eight weeks of high fat diet also elicited a significant increase in systemic inflammation markers LPS and TNF-a as well as an increase in oxidative damage of plasma lipids and hepatic necrosis Table 4.
