Furthermore comparison of the hnf4a mutant Mut vs. wild-type WT geno- types revealed differential expression of many genes in the CV condition 2741 genes and GF condition 1441 genes that inform a general role for Hnf4a in regulating genes in the intestinal tract Fig.

When we compared the 598 genes that were microbiota responsive in wild-type digestive tracts with the 2741 genes that Hnf4a regulates in CV digestive tracts we found these lists shared 295 genes that included fads2 and saa both of which have human orthologs that are ei- ther implicated FADS12 or markers SAA of IBD Fig.

However we did find that the average CV HNF4A ChIP-seq signal strength was significantly increased at HNF4A sites associated with micro- biota-induced genes relative to those HNF4A sites associated with microbiota-suppressed genes suggesting HNF4A may play a limited role in genes up-regulated by colonization Supplemental Fig.

Log10 P-values were calculated using a hypergeometric en- richment analysis and converting all HNF4A ChIP associated mouse genes to human orthologs GF  5863 genes and CV  2119 genes.

These 88 genes represent al- most half of all 185 genes suppressed by the microbiota.

Genetic analysis revealed that zebrafish hnf4a activates nearly half of the genes that are suppressed by microbiota suggesting microbiota negatively regulate Hnf4a.

Genome-wide compari- son of transcript levels in intestinal tissue or isolated IECs from mice reared in the absence of microbes germ-free or GF to those colonized with a microbiota conventionalized or CV have re- vealed hundreds of genes that have significantly increased or de- creased mRNA levels following microbiota colonization Camp et al.

Together these results estab- lish that Hnf4a is required for in3.4 activity in IECs and raises the possibility that Hnf4a may have broader roles in mediating host transcriptional and physiological responses to microbiota.Hnf4a activates transcription of genes that are suppressed upon microbiota colonizationTo better define the roles of Hnf4a in microbiota response and oth- er aspects of digestive physiology we used RNA-seq to compareHnf4a mediates microbial control of IEC genesFigure 1.

An unbiased analysis found that three HNF4A binding site motifs were significantly P  1x 10-45 P  1x 10-28 and P 1 x 10-13 enriched in promoters of genes associ- ated with microbiota-suppressed enhancers Supplemental Fig.S4E and STAT1 binding site motifs were significantly P 1 x 10-16 enriched in promoters of genes associated with micro- biota-activated enhancers Supplemental Fig.
