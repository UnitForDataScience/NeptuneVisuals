By sampling plants grown in the same type of soil along an altitudinal transect we studied changes in the composition of endo- phytes inhabiting plants that are exposed to different climatic conditions throughout the year similarly to recent studies on plant-associated fungal assemblages in Coince et al.

Bacteria from the Coxiellaceae Hyphomicrobiaceae Nocardioidaceae Methylocystaceae Ohtaekwangia and Sinobacteraceae families were more commonly found in greenhouse plants while Pseudomo- nadaceae were more common in field-grown plants.

4 were highest in plants grow- ing at high temperature 358C and lowest in plants growing at the lowest temperature 158C.

Four plants were sampled at Tf0 and twelve plants three per field were sampled at all successive samplings.

Five plants were sampled at the beginning of the experiment to represent the initial bacterial communities greenhouse time- point Tg0 then the plants were placed in cells with a fixed air temperature either 158C 258C or 358C and 168 h lightdark photoperiod.

A second sampling of three plants for each temperature treatment greenhouse time-point Tg2 was carried out after 3 months.The sampled plants were taken immediately to the lab quickly washed and air-dried at room temperature.

Dried roots were weighed at one timepoint during the course of each experi- ment at Tg2 for greenhouse plants and at Tf1 for field plants.DNA extraction handling and amplificationIn total 104 and 58 samples were collected from plants grown in field and greenhouse conditions respectively.

In annual plants the soil is the main source of endophytic colonisation but several vertically-transmitted endophytes are also commonly found Hodgson et al.
