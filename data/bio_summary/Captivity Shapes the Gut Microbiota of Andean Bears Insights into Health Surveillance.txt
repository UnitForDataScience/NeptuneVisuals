Within these gene families four were significantly higher in wild Andean bears compared with captive Andean bears Supplementary Figure 3 and Table 3.DISCUSSIONThe gut microbiota of Andean bears varied significantly between wild and captive individuals.

The diversity of wild bears' gut microbiota was higher than in captive bears according to mean Shannon wild 4.87 1.11 vs. captivity 3.23 0.15 p-value 0.00196 ANOVA test Chao1wild 944.66 1.1 vs. captivity 19.02 1.11 p-value 0.0618 ANOVA test and Simpson wild 0.90 0.10 vs. captivity0.860.10 p-value 0.354 ANOVA test estimates of adiversity.Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis between wild and captive individuals showed that the gut microbiota of wild Andean bears has an uneven composition across samples with higher intra- group variations average similarity  74.89 contrasting withan even composition for captive Andean bear samples with lower intra-group variation average similarity 96 .

Interestingly it was only found one shared OTU in 75 of the individuals within the wild Andean bear group whereas several OTUs were identified in all the captive Andean bear samples.TABLE 2  Changes in the relative abundance of glycosyl-hydrolase containing families within Firmicutes phylum identified as present in either Wild or Captive animals.WildCaptivityPaenibacillaceae0.256 x 10-3Clostridiaceae0.093 x 10-3Ruminococcaceae8.6 x 10-40Lactobacillaceae0.229.9 x 10-4Lachnospiraceae0.380We observed that regardless of the geographic origin of captive individuals all of them exhibited a very similar gut microbiota with slight variations in relative abundances of microbial lineages.

Further considerations should be taken into account for nutritional schemes improving ex-situ conservation and its potential as a surveillance tool of endangered populations of wild Andean bears.Keywords 16S rDNA gene Andean bears conservation gut microbiota host-microbiota interactions herbivory feeding ecology metagenomics Tremarctos ornatusINTRODUCTIONThe Andean bear has a predominantly plant-based diet but there is almost no evidence suggesting adaptations for herbivory in this species   .

Interestingly they were only found in wild Andean bear samples and below detection levels for samples from captive individuals which could suggest that the fiber-reduced diet in captivity is modifying the ability of the gut microbiota to degrade recalcitrant substrates such as cellulose hemicellulose lignocellulose among others that are commonly found on the main resources of wild Andean bears' diet.

However the Andean bear which depends on more than 114 plant species consume cattle only rarely and opportunistically not as an active strategy of foraging but because of the expansion of human villages into the Andean bear habitat       .This habitat degradation that Andean bears are facing could have a strong effect on gut microbial diversity because habitat degradation leads to reduction of plant diversity and the availability of food plants  .

The potential impact of the gut microbiota on the Andean bears' health indicates the importance of these analyses as a valuable tool into the conservation of the species.Previous findings with skull morpho-mechanics show no indication of adaptations for herbivory in Andean bears although their mainly herbivorous diet.

This assessment provides the first findings describing the gut microbiota of Andean bears and its relationship to their diet.MATERIALS AND METHODSCollection of Fecal SamplesSamples from wild and captive Andean bears were collected during a period of 2 years between 2013 and 2015.

A Welch's t-test was implemented using STAMP   to compare the relative abundance of the predicted KEGG pathways and OTUs for captive and wild statuses.RESULTSWe characterized the gut microbiota of captive Andean bears maintained in Guasca and Mesitas and wild Andean bears located in Pantano de Martos Guatavita Colombia.

These core functions in the Andean bear gut microbiota could be involved with detoxifying xenobiotics present in the plant-based diet of the host as it has been reported for the gut microbiota of other mammals   .
