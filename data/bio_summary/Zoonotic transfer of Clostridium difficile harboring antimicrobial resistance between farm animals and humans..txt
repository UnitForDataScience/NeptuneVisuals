Enhanced research focus on C. difficile in the aftermath of the C. difficile RT027 outbreaks has revealed other evolutionarily distinct C. difficile lineages in particular C. difficile RT078 NAP07-08ST-11 that are nowemerging for unknown reasons as significant human pathogens .The One Health concept which connects the health of humans to the health of animals and their shared environments represents a relevant framework for under- standing the emergence and spread of pathogens.

We explored the phylogenetic structure of C. difficile RT078 by generating a core genome maximum likelihood phylogeny that included the 247 C. difficile RT078 strains and the reference genome of C. difficile M120 n 248 .

The absence of accessory genes unique to either group either demonstrates that C. difficile has a stable accessory genome that is host- independent or provides further support for the frequent transmission of C. difficile between host populations.Given the high percentage of mobile elements including antimicrobial resistance genes harbored by C. difficile genomes   we next sought to analyze distribution of different ARGs in the pangenome of human and animal strains.

Unlike the hospital-associated C. difficile RT027 lineage the community-associated C. difficile RT078 lineage is isolated from both humans and farm animals however the geo- graphical population structure and transmission networks remain unknown.

C. difficile RT078 is commonly isolated from both humans and farm animals  and is increasingly recognized as a causative agent of both health care- and community-associated C. difficile infection CDI .

Nevertheless the exact evolutionary and epidemiological relationships between human and animal C. difficile RT078 strains remain unknown due to the lack of discriminatory power of these typing methods and the clonal nature of C. difficile lineages.

Recently using whole-genome phylogeny we reported that asymptomatic farmers and their pigs can be colonized with clonal C. difficile RT078 isolates demonstrating evidence for spread between animals and humans .MATERIALS AND METHODSCollection of C. difficile strains.

C. difficile laboratories worldwide were asked to send a diverse representation of their C. difficile 078 collections to the Lawley Laboratory hosted at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

The genomes of 182 strains designated C. difficile RT078 NAP07- 08ST-11 by PCR ribotyping  were sequenced and combined with our previous collection of 65 strains of C. difficile RT078  making a total of 247 strains analyzed in this study.
