the 161 participants in this study were divided into 4 groups group 1 hbv cirrhosis patients n  38 group 2 chronic hbv patients n  35 group 3 hbv carriers n  33 and group 4 healthy controls n  55. the culture-depen- dent method identified saccharomyces cerevisiae and four candida species c. albicans candida glabrata candida krusei and candida tropicalis.

whereas healthy controls were colonized by c. tropicalis ibd patients had a higher di- versity of candida and other species namely c. trop- icalis c. glabrata c. krusei candida guilliermondii candida kefyr and geotrichium candidum .

when further classifying the candida species candida albicans was the most prevalent identified in 58 and 83 of hiv-negative and positive individuals respectively.

adding either pichia cells or the medium they were grown in referred to as pichia spent medium psm inhibited the growth of aspergillus fusarium and candida in addition to inhibiting candida biofilm formation.

that demonstrated an important role of dectin-1 in chemically induced colitis and candida colonization van der velden and his colleagues investigated whether dectin-1 function and candida colonization in humans had any implications for gastrointestinal gvhd .

the fungal genera representing the com of the oral cavity were candida species 75 of individuals cladosporium species 60 aureobasi- dium species 50 members of the saccharomycetales 50 aspergillus species 35 fusarium species30 and cryptococcus species 20. interestingly principle component analysis revealed significant individ- ual mycobiome variations between white and asian men.

in healthy individuals the gastrointestinal mycobiome is thought to include 66 fungal genera with candida being the predominant one in addition to 184 species.

some of the most common nonpathogenic genera in- habiting the gastrointestinal tract include cladosporium penicillium mucor and saccharomyces potentially pathogenic genera include aspergillus candida cryp- tococcus fusarium and pneumocystis.

in the core oral bacteriome 13 of14 genera were common between the two cohorts whereas the com was different and candida was the most common fungus in both cohorts.

furthermore they identified a nonpathogenic member of the com pichia that exhibits an antagonistic inhibitory effect against pathogenic fungi including candida crypto- coccus aspergillus and fusarium .

correlation dif- ference network analysis showed that rothia candida and certain metabolites namely phenylacetate sorbitol and histamine demonstrate a statistically significant correlation difference between hiv-positive and -nega- tive cohorts.

the investigators identified a higher abundance of candida and saccharomyces with in- creased severity of hbv infection and patients with hbv-cirrhosis or chronic hbv infection had greater fungal diversity than hbv carriers and healthy controls.

to compare the candida profile in the upper gastrointestinal tract oral cavity and lower gastrointestinal tract in patients with ibd trojanowska et al.

the investigators reported a similar alteration in the profile of non-albicans candida species in both the uc and cd groups.

the mycobiome profile of dectin-1-deficient mice was characterized by an increase in the prevalence of pathogenic fungi candida and trichosporon accom- panied by an increase in inflamed intestinal tissue and a decrease in the nonpathogenic fungi saccharomyces .
