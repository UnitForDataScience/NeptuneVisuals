The default threshold for functional intolerance used was 0.05 for amino acid substitution.maintained the physicochemical properties by replacing hydrophobic amino acid V395A and I388V and thereby infectivity of HCVpp .

Mutations in hepatitis C virus E2 located outside the CD81 binding sites lead to escape from broadly neutralizing antibodies but compro- mise virus infectivity.

We observed a significant reduction in HCVpp infectivity with VF-Fab1a-1-3 and VF-Fab1b-1-3 VF-Fab1a- 1-3 and VF-Fab1b-5-1 VF-Fab1b-1-3 and VF-Fb1b-5-1 and VF-Fab1b-5-1 and VF-Fab3a-1-1 combinations when compared to the individual VF-Fab concentration Dunnett t test Putative Epitopes targeted by VF-Fab.VF-Fabs binding to b-turn mimics was higher when compared with that of linear mimics Ref AF011751 Pepscan Presto Lelystad Netherlands AN1 epitope is located within HVR1 which is non-modelled and is represented in a white spherical cartoon .Conformational epitope mapping of E2 glycoprotein region starting from amino acid 384-619.

Although the VF-Fab were derived from sera from an anti-D cohort we observed varying degree of neutralisation breadth in HCVpp1b-1-2 and 1b-1-3 which were also derived from an anti-D patient serum.Conformational epitope mapping of E2Based on the available anti-HCV monoclonal nAb mapping information and E2 structure we selected amino acid residues that cover HVR1 384-410 HVR2 460-482 E2 b-sandwich 492-566 and IgVR 572-588 spanning up to aa 619 for conformational epitope mapping      .

The colour development was quantified with a charge coupled device camera and an image processing system.SIFT analysis to study small genomic variations in putative epitopes in E2We analysed the amino acid sequences of all the infectious HCVpp to assess whether an amino acid substitution in the predicted epitopes affect the protein function using a well characterised analytical tool called Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant SIFT.

Score at a particular position for an amino acid substitution is mentioned below the amino acid variant.

We observed that in the E1 glycoprotein of HCVpp1b-1-3 a polar amino acid T was replaced by a hydrophobicA amino acid at position 292 SIFT score 0.26.
