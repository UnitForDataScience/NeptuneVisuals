Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed in RStudio Version 0.98.1103 to compare variation in Bifidobacterium Bacteroides and Bacteroidetes quantity in the combined totality of the treatment groups active FOS passive FOS active water and passive water versus the fecal pellet samples from non-handled mice housed in the same facility for both pup and dam samples.

There were no significant differences in Firmicutes amounts between the passive water and activeGroupTaxaMaximumMinimumMedianInterquartilerangewater groups p  0.171 passive water and passive FOS groups p  0.247 active water and active FOS groups p  0.067 or active FOS and passive FOS groups p  0.329.

These significant differences for Bacteroides p-value 0.003 and BifidobacteriumGroupTaxaMaximumMinimumMedianInterquartilerangep-value  0.006 median counts in the control and treatment samples were also evident at PND21 despite a large difference in sample size control N  3 treatment N  14.Wilcoxon rank sum tests found no significant difference between samples from the two control dams and samples from the treatment dams N  4.

All samples for the treatment dams contained 101 Bifidobacterium.Fecal pellet samplesFecal pellet samples from non-handled pups and dams were measured for Bifidobacterium Bacteroides Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes log10 CFU equivalentsng of DNA as a control for pups for dams.

Plates were run at 50C for 2 min 95C for 10 min and then 45 cycles of 95C for 15 s and 60C for 1 min.Statistical analysisThe Kruskal-Wallis test was performed in RStudio Version 0.98.1103 to compare variation in Bifidobacterium Firmicutes Bacteroides and Bacteroidetes quantity between treatment groups active fructooligosaccharide FOS passive FOS active water and passive water.

While the significant difference in Firmicutes between the passive water pups and active FOS pups suggests administration of FOS was able to increase the amount of Firmicutes all of the treatment groups still had a median amount 102-103 below the median amount of the control group.

All cages were clear plastic 10.5 inches by 6.5 inches by 5.0 inches.Experimental manipulationsDams were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups passive water passive fructooligosaccharide FOS active water active FOS buccal water and buccal FOS.

The statistically significant differences in quantities of Bacteroides Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium between the control and treatment groups suggest a factor common to all four treatment groups may have affected these phyla of gut microbiota.Lack of initial exposure to Bifidobacterium Bacteroides and Bacteroidetes and differences between voided fecal pellets and GI tract fecal samples may explain the differences in bacterial quantities between our handled and non-handled animals however we think these are unlikely explanations.

Therefore while some variation may be expected due to differences in sample collection it is unlikely to reach the magnitude of difference between the median bifidobacteria from the control pups and the treatment pups.While non-exposure to bacteria is an unlikely explanation the stress of handlingcommon to all treatment groups may have contributed to the changes across the treatment group gut microbiota.

Since the sample sizes were very unequal for non-handled control N  7 versus treatment N  21 pups Wilcoxon tests were also performed to compare the quantity of Bifidobacterium Bacteroides and Bacteroidetes in the combinedtreatment groups against the fecal pellet samples from pups on PND14 and PND21.
