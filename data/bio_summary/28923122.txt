It was demonstrated previously that summer microbial community decomposes labile C sources such as root exu- dates or glucose rapidly - and there is experimental evidence that labile substrates may prime decomposition of recalcitrant OM -An alternative explanation such as that seasonal differences in transcription of CAZymes are driven by temperature is less plausible because it logically sug- gests the lower activity of both fungi and bacteria in winter but the decrease of trnascription was specific only for ECM fungi Although we still lack an understanding of the dif- ferences in metabolic resting states in fungi and bacteria the most plausible solution to the problem of decreased transcrip- tion in winter in ECM fungi seems to be diminished supply of C from the symbiotic trees.

Dominance of saprotrophic fungi which are largely responsible for degradation of lignocel- lulose in spring and ECM fungi which are involved in plant derived C storage in soil in late summer was shown for the temperate and boreal forests - In case of ECM fungi it is thought to be supported bymaximal growth of spruce fine roots in the summer with which they are symbiotic Bacterial community composition also responded to the seasonal changes in temperate forest  and alpine soils and it was interpreted as a reaction to C fluctuations in plant roots exudates during the year as well as with variation in moisture and temperature of soil.The photosynthetic activity of trees during the summer period is high with favorable temperature and light condi- tions while it is minimal in winter when it is reduced by light limitations and temperatures below the freezing point.

Relative abun- dance of 120 individual gene families was significantly different among horizons for 72 gene families but among season only for 9 gene families in litter and 2 gene fam- ilies in soils indicating that the community compos- ition is horizon-specific but similar in both seasons Additional file  Table S1.DiscussionGene pool of CAZymes and its transcriptionsOur results confirmed that all CAZy families were tran- scribed by many taxa at the same time and more isoforms of CAZymes were found in the genomes of the most abundant species of bacteria binned from metagenome data not shown which suggest high functional redun- dancy in soil environment confirming the observations previously made for another functional gene cellobiohy- drolase cbhI which was also produced simultaneously by hundreds of taxa .The share of fungi in our metatranscriptome is two times higher than bacteria while in the metatranscrip- tomic studies from a maple forest or in peatlands bac- terial CAZy transcripts were 2.6 to 5-fold more abundant then eukaryotic ones  This may indi- cate high importance of fungi in coniferous forests al- though the comparison may be biased by the fact that previous studies annotated short reads and used a lim- ited reference database for fungi so that relevant tran- scripts might have been overlooked.

Although both fungi and bacteria contribute to CAZy transcription our results confirmed the leading role of fungi in the degradation processes as confirmed by the fact that thy produced more than half the observed CAZymes.Additional filesAbbreviationsAA Auxiliary carbohydrate-active enzymes C Carbon CAZy Carbohydrate active enzymes ECM Ectomycorrhizal fungi FPPD Fungal-predicted protein database GH Glycoside hydrolases N Nitrogen OM Organic matterAcknowledgementsNot applicable.FundingThis work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation 16-08916S the Ministry of Education Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic LD15086 LM2015055 and by the research concept of the Institute of Microbiology of the CAS RVO61388971.

The results of aforementioned studies indicate that fungi and bacteria are involved in decomposition of different sub- strates but the share of fungi and bacteria in degradation of these substrates is still unknown.Seasonality in temperate forest soils is composed of individual and well documented factors controlling soil microbial communities -such as a change in soil moisture soil temperature and plant activity that strongly affects C cycling in forest ecosystems One of the approaches to study the effect of seasonality on C cycling is to measure activities of microbial CAZymes in the studied environment.

To survive the winter season we expect ECM fungi to subsist on plants storage compounds such as starch or on their own storage compounds such as glycogen and trehalose and to transcribe the genes for relevant CAZymes such as amylases and trehalases respectively.In this study for the first time we describe the contribu- tion of fungi and bacteria to CAZyme pool in two different seasons summer and winter leveraging the power of meta- genomics and metatranscriptomics with sufficient reliability and resolution.

Soil showed an increased share of enzymes acting on glyco- gen and especially trehalose which both are known reserve compounds of fungi including ECM fungi Involvement of soil organisms in C transformationThe vast majority of GH and AA 83-92 and 93-95 respectively were encoded and transcribed by microor- ganisms i.e.

GH38 are necessary for the correct root development and laccases perform many roles such as lignin polymerization and tissue repair Seasonality of C utilizationHere we confirm the previous observation that compos- ition of microbial communities in litter and soil in both seasons remains stable as observed elsewhere - but our results from the same ecosystem indicate that the ratio of fungi to bacteria and fungal biomass are sig- nificantly higher in summer than in winter We also show that transcripts of genes encoding enzymes for fungal and bacterial cell wall degradation are higher in summer than in winter which may indicate higher growth rates in summer for fungi and bacteria respect- ively.

However we hypothesize that in winter ECM fungi utilize a-glucosidases and amylases to survive on storage compounds while in summer they thrive on root exudates degradation of which fuel the production of ligninolytic enzymes in search of ECM fungi for N in recalcitrant OM .

Microorganisms are the most important producers of these enzymes especially GH and AA CAZymes with fungi strongly dominating tran- scription in litter and equal contributions of bacteria and fungi in soil.
