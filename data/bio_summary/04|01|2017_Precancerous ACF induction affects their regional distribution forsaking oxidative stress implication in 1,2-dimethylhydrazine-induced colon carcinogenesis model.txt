unlike hyperplastic acf dysplastic acf possess colon cancer genes and thus may have greater potential to progress into malignancy orlando et al.

furthermore observation of carcinogenesis 12 and 14 weeks resulted in an increase in proximal and large acf suggesting a progression of cancer from distal to proximal and an evolution of small acf to large acf.acf are heterogeneous and thus acf subtypes reflect the carcinogenesis process and the unique histological changes exhibited raju .

acf appear predominantly in the distal colon early in carcinogenesis subsequently they appear in the proximal colon with some exhibiting focal expansion bird  caderni et al.
