Unlike hyperplastic ACF dysplastic ACF possess colon cancer genes and thus may have greater potential to progress into malignancy Orlando et al.

All markers MPO MDA and NO peaked at week 12 p  0.01 and decreased at week 14 p  0.05 while L- ornithine decreased through all protocol p  0.01.

Compared to distal colons proximal MPO and MDA levelsactivities decreased significantly in DMH-treated groups during all the experimental period p  0.05 while GSH decreased in DMH10 group p  0.05 and increased afterward reaching higher levels then control at 14 weeks p  0.05.

Thus ACF was categorized as 1 2 3Inflammation and oxidative stress assessmentMyeloperoxidase activity MPO was measured in the colon tissue homogenates according to Krawisz et al.

ACF appear predominantly in the distal colon early in carcinogenesis subsequently they appear in the proximal colon with some exhibiting focal expansion Bird  Caderni et al.

ACF grow by a ''mechanism of crypt fission'' Tsukamoto et al.
