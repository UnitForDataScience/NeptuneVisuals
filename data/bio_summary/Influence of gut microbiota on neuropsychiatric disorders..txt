indeed different studies have reported that gut microbiota is able to shape brain physiology and thus behavior through the gut-microbiota-brain axis and have suggested gut microbiota as a key trigger factor in the development of many neuropsychiatric conditions5.modifications9.currently it is well accepted that our gut microbiota is critical for brain processes such as myelination neurogenesis and microglial activation and can effectively modulate behavior and influence psycholo gical processes such as mood and cognition10.

newborn adolescence and elderly populations.many factors including human genetics influence the gut microbiota composition therefore the mi- crobiota constitutes a highly dynamic ecosystem with high inter-individual variability1415 and this indeed hampers the understanding of the role of gut microbiota in the etiology and progress of neuropsychiatric diseases.nowadays each adult individual is believed to harbor a unique gut microbiota composition as per- sonal as a fingerprint and certain early life events may be important contributors to the individual's microbiota including mode of delivery type of feeding medication stress and infections15.

furthermore another recent study demonstrated that a single probiotic bacteria a strain of the species lactobacillus reuteri can modulate oxytocin levels and reverse autism- related behavior raising the possibility of influencing social behavior by targeting the gut microbiota42.autism spectrum disorder asd is often associated with gastrointestinal co-morbidities and recent studies have shown changes in the gut microbiota of autistic children including shifts in levels of bacteroidetes and firmicutes phyla with the abundance of clostridium establishing a strong link between gut microbiota and asd4344.

however prospective longitudinal studies in subjects at risk of pd are still required to further elucidate the causal role of the gut microbiota and microbial products in the development of pd and its manifestations.very recently it has been reported that gut microbiota is involved in motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a model of pd suggesting that the changes in the gut microbiota represent a risk factor for pd78.

gut microbiota is currently viewed as a key regulator of a fluent bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain gut-brain axis.

in this respect recent studies in animals have indicated that gut microbiota transplantation can transfer a behavioral phenotype suggesting that the gut microbiota may be a modifiable factor modulating the development or pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric conditions.

we also consider the stages of life where the gut microbiota is more susceptible to the effects of environmental stressors and the possible microbiota-targeted intervention strategies that could improve health status and prevent psychiatric disorders in the near future.key words microbiota microbiome dysbiosis brain- gut axis mental health psychiatric conditionsc the authors 2017. published by baishideng publishing group inc. all rights reserved.most of the neuropsychiatric disorders are considered as multifactorial disorders prompted by certain environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals.

consequently it has been suggested that gut micro- biota may be involved in the pathogenesis and riskof developing neuropsychiatric disorders throughcenit mc sanz y codoner-franch p. influence of gut microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders.

despite these findings there is currently a need for longitudinal studies in humans to assess the impact of the gut microbiota dynamics on the maintenance or decline of neurocognitive function and to understand to what extent results in animal models can be generalized to humans19.in this review first we summarize the current evidence for a role of the gut microbiota in brain development and function and also summarize the state of the art on the different mechanisms involved.thereafter we provide an update on research into specific neuropsychiatric disorders.

we also refer to the different stages of gut microbiota development and maturation identifying the periods where the gut microbiota is more unstable and therefore at greater risk of suffering microbiota alterations due to exposure to stressors.

results of animal studies show that stress and emotions cause the brain to influence the microbial composition of the gut through the release of hormones or neurotransmitters which influence gut physiology and alter the habitat of the microbiota resulting in preferential growth of certain communities.

however it is still unclear whether scfas produced in the gut can cross the blood-brain barrier.epigenetics gut microbiota and neurological conditionsit is currently well recognized that there are many changes in gene expression not caused by variationswhich modulate chromatin remodeling and the final translation of coding mrna into proteins.

a recent study published in science reported a correlation between a more diverse gut microbiota composition and depression in humans after investigating the gut microbiomes of 1135 participants from a dutch population cohort using deep sequencing64.different diets have been suggested to haveeither positive or negative effects on depression.
