F. nucleatum Induces Chemoresistance in Colorectal Cancer Cells via Activation of the Autophagy PathwayA-D Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in HCT116 cells A B and HT29 cells C D. The cells were co-cultured with F. nucleatum or treated with CQ and different concentrations of Oxaliplatin A and C and 5-FU B D. nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.E and F Cleaved caspases and p-H2AX expression were detected by western blot in HCT116 cells E and HT29 cells F. The cells were co-cultured with F. nucleatum or treated with CQ and different concentrations of Oxaliplatin and 5-FU.G and H Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in HCT116 cells G and HT29 cells H. The cells were transfected with ULK1 and ATG7 siRNAs and subsequently co-cultured with F. nucleatum and different concentrations of Oxaliplatin nonparametric Mann- Whitney test.See also Figure S3.Figure 4.

F. nucleatum Promotes Cancer Autophagy ActivationA ssGSEA analysis was conducted to show the relationship between the amount of F. nucleatum and autophagy-related pathways in CRC tissues.B C Real-Time PCR was performed in HCT116 cells B and HT29 C cells cultured with F. nucleatum nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.Western blot was performed on autophagy element expression in HCT116 cells co- cultured with F. nucleatum E. coli E. faecalis or B. fragilis.Western blot was performed in HCT116 cells co-cultured with F. nucleatum in the presence of CQ.F and G HCT116 cells F and HT29 cells G that stably expressed mRFP-EGFP-LC3 fusion protein were co-cultured with F. nucleatum.

In addition autophagosomes were evaluated in HCT116 cells and HT29 cells co-cultured with or without F. nucleatum Figure 2H.Transmission electron microscopy showed an increase in the formation of autophagic vesicles in the F. nucleatum-co-cultured HCT116 cells Figure 2I and HT29 cells Figure 2J.

In addition western blotting revealed that overexpression of miR-18a or miR-4802 suppressed F. nucleatum-induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and simultaneously increased p62 protein expression in HCT116 cells Figures 4F and 4G and HT29 cells Figures S4J and S4K.Accumulation of autophagosomes was reduced in miR-18a and miR-4802 overexpressing HCT116 cells Figures 4H and 4I and HT29 cells Figures S4L and S4M co-cultured withF.

Western blotting showed that the inhibitory effects of F. nucleatum on the chemotherapy-induced caspase and PARP cleavage and p-H2AX were abolished by miR-18a and miR-4802 mimics transfection in HCT116 cells Figure 5E and HT29 cells Figure S5F.In the CRC xenograft mouse models HCT116 cells and HT29 cells were inoculated into nude mice followed by treatment with miRNAs chemotherapeutic agents F. nucleatum-co- culture and other manipulations.

Furthermore we treated HCT116 cells Figure 2E and HT29 cells Figure S2G with Chloroquine CQ an autophagy lysosomal inhibitor.Addition of CQ blocked the autophagic flux in the F. nucleatum-cultured cells Figure 2E.

We compared Oxaliplatin-induced cell apoptosis among the parental SW480 cells the Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 cells and the F. nucleatum-co-cultured parental SW480 cells in the presence of different concentrations of Oxaliplatin Figures S3I and S3J.

We found that109.9 mM Oxaliplatin resulted in 50 32.9 and 35.5 cell apoptosis in the parental SW480 cells the Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 cells and the F. nucleatum-co-cultured parental SW480 cells respectively Figure S3I.

In further support of this possibility the EC50 of Oxaliplatin was 109.9 mM 190.9 mM and 177.2 mM for the parental SW480 cells the Oxaliplatin- resistant SW480 cells and the F.nucleatum-cultured parental SW480 cells respectively Figure S3J.

The data suggest that F. nucleatum endows potent chemoresistance to several CRC cells.To address whether F. nucleatum modulates CRC chemoresistance via the autophagy pathway we co-cultured HCT116 cells and HT29 cells with F. nucleatum and treated these cells with Oxaliplatin and 5-FU in the presence of CQ.
