therefore the lung microbiota can be influenced by either microorganisms or immune responses generated by these external microbiota that could lead to microbial dysbiosis with more persistence and greater residence of these microbiota in patients with various respiratory diseases including asthma.evidence for potential interactions between mucosal tissues of the gut and lung  which constitute a gut-lung axis has been obtained in mice in which depletion of the microbiota led to more severe bacterial pneumonia whereas restoring microbiota in the gut reduced the severity of pneumonia.there is also evidence that stimulation of the airways with lipopolysccharide leads to acute changes in the gut microbiotaindicating that the gut-lung axis can operate both ways.

compared with the gut microbiota the lung microbiota only represents a fraction of what is seen in the gut and its composition is influenced by the degree of contaminationfig 1. cross-talk between the gut and lung microbiota the gut-lung axis.

subjects with th2-high asthma had lower bacterial burden.balasthmatic patients with the lowest levels of eosinophils had an altered bacterial abundance with more neisseria bacteroides and rothia species and less sphingomonas halomonas and aeribacillus species compared with asthmatic patients with more eosinophils and healthy control subjects.bal bronchoalveolar lavage copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ics inhaled corticosteroid otu operational taxonomic units.children.in a study of amish and hutterites 2 agricultural communities whose lifestyles were similar but with different prevalence of asthma and allergic sensitization being 4 to 6 times lower than in amish endotoxin levels in the amish were 6.8 times as high with differences in the microbial composition of the house dust collected in homes.in an anal- ysis of microbiota of throat and nasal samples from school-age farm and nonfarm children alterations in nasal microbiota but not from throat microbiota were associated with asthma.

it is likely that corticosteroids alter the lung microbiome and that the altered lung microbiome can contribute to corticoste- roid responsiveness.another aspect of the microbiota and corticosteroid therapy is the report that gut microbiota can completely metabolize corticosteroids such as prednisolone beclomethasone dipropio- nate and budesonide and therefore lung microbiota might share the same effect on inhaled corticosteroids.

the presence of microbial dysbiosis in asthmatic patients as detected by using the culture-independent technique of 16s rrna sequencing and also by using metagenomic sequencing places the onus on us to culture and study the interactions of these bacterial communities with the airways so that we can understand their individual contribution to the asthmatic process.from a clinical viewpoint these recent observations point to the more important noninfective aspects of the microbiota the fact that the microbiota exists in communities and the fact that there is an important evolution of the microbiota from birth through to adulthood.

identification of lower airway microbiota from an analysis of bronchial brushings from healthy adult subjects indicated that the lower airways of the lungs were not sterile as previously thought.despite its lower order of magnitude of abundance compared with gut microbiota the role of this lung microbiome in healthy subjects remains unclear.

it is now becoming evident that the gut microbiome might have an important influence on the lung microbiome and the potential lines of communication between the 2 microbiota are currently being investigated.the lung microbiome in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was also reported to be altered for the first time in the same report of lower airway microbiota in healthy subjects.this seminal observation has opened up the possibility that lung microbial imbalance or lung microbial dysbiosis couldhave a causative role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.asthma is a disease that has increased in prevalence over the last 50 years particularly in advanced countries and one explanation that has been put forward to explain this increase is the hygiene hypothesis.this hypothesis posits that reduced exposure to bacterial infections during the early years leads to development of allergic diseases including asthma.

the gut microbiota which consists of 100 trillion microorganisms made of more than 1000 distinct bacterial species can influence the lung microbiota by modulating lung immunity through production of bacterial ligands bacterial metabolites and immune cells that can circulate through the blood to reach the lungs.

by contrast reduced exposure to firmicutes and bacteroidetes was associated with atopy and wheeze.a meta-analysis performed in 2015 reported that there is some evidence to support a protective role for breast-feeding with regard to asthma between the ages of 5 and 18 years.breast milk has a unique microbiota consisting of staphylococcus streptococcus lactobacillus and bifidobacterium speciesand other products that can provide antigen-specific immune protection such as soluble iga.breast milk could stimulate the proliferation of a well-balanced and diverse microbiota in the neonate which initially influences a switch from an intrauterine th2-high to a more th1th2-balanced response and with activation of treg cells.

the potential for respiratory tract viruses to cause microbial dysbiosis in asthmatic patients is not known but is most likely to occur.taken together there are significant changes in the lung microbiota in asthmatic patients and different inflammatory phenotypes can be associated with distinct microbiota with the most common dysbiotic communities related to an increase in proteobacteria.

the development of asthma in childhood is closely associated with altered microbiota in childhood that leads to a loss of the protective effect of a ''normal'' microbiota.

in adults with established asthma differ- ences in microbiota have been associated with disease severity and specific patterns of microbiota might be distinctly associated with certain phenotypes of severe asthma.

by studying the formation of the airway microbiota in early life in a model of house dust mite sensitization and challenge in experimental mice gollwitzer et al showed that the airway microbiota induce regulatory cells early in life which when dysregulated can lead to sustained susceptibility to allergic airway inflammation in adulthood.

in addition th17 cells can be induced by bacterial infections and this has been implicated in corticosteroid insensitivity.type 3 innate lymphoid cells in the gut regulate gut-associated lymphoid tissue formation inflammation and immunity by responding to signals from the gut microbiota through il-17a il-17f and il-22.the role of type 3 innate lymphoid cells in lung microbial dysbiosis is unknown but could be important in the induction of th17 cells.treatment potential to alter lung and gut microbiome in relation to asthmaeffect of corticosteroidsthe effect of asthma treatment particularly inhaled and oral corticosteroids on the airway microbiota remains unclear.
