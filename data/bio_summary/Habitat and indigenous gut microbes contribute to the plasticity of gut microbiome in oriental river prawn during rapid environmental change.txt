we found that when shrimp were exposed to a new habitat with higher microbial biodiversity both environmental and indigenous gut microbes contribute to the plasticity of shrimp gut microbiome consequently leading to higher composition variation and divergence among individuals yet when shrimp were transplanted to an environment with lower microbial diver- sity only indigenous gut microbiota function as a major contributor leading to a convergence of between-host within-group diversity.

we inferred that when shrimp were exposed to a new habitat with higher microbial biodiversity both environmental and indigenous gut microbes contribute to the plasticity of shrimp gut microbiome consequently leading to higher composition variation and divergence among individuals by contrast when facing lower microbial diversity only indigenous gut micro- biota play as a major contributor leading to a convergence of between-host diversity.interestingly several potential pathogens of shrimp   such as aeromonadaceae mor- axellaceae pseudomonadaceae and flavobacteriaceae were among the targeted gut microbes with fold change 2 2.00 associated with habitat exchange in lake-to-river shrimps.

three lake shrimp c and six river shrimp k were selected as control groups and the remaining wild-harvested shrimp five from each habitat were used for habitat- exchange experiment.

corresponding with micro- bial diversity of their living water areas the divergence in gut microbes of lake-to-river shrimp ck increased while that of river-to-lake shrimp kc decreased.

importantly among the candidate environment specific gut microbes in habitat-exchanged shrimp over half of reads were associated with the indigenous bacteria in native shrimp gut yet more candidates presented in ck may reflect the complexity of new environment.

a recent study on gut microbiota of freshwater shrimp showed that the host genetics was a main contributor to the divergence of shrimp gut microbiomes between two closely related species while the host habitat type seemed to play a critical role when comparing the microbial variation of hosts belonging to different lineages .

the observations suggest that this freshwater shrimp exhibits different phenotypes depending on environmental conditions  and therefore provides a feasible model to study whether the divergence in gut microbiome behaves as a driving force of host phenomicplasticity in shrimp.

these findings give us the opportunity to infer the potential benefits of receiving microbes from water with higher diverse microbiota.resultsgut microbial divergence among shrimp groupsto study the role of the gut microbiota in habitat acclimatization we chose macrobrachium nipponense as a model species to investigate i whether gut microbial communities changed after habitat-exchange between river and lake for one month and ii whether habitat- exchanged shrimp received new colonization from environmental microbiota.

the results showed that when shrimp experienced habitat exchange the gut microbial compositions still presented a higher correlation with those of shrimp from the original habitat.

for example as shown in  the habitat-exchanged individuals lake-to-river ck1 ck2 and ck5-7 have gut microbial compositions closer to that of native river shrimp c1-3 in the hierarchicalfrequency of otus in the shrimp gut microbiome represented as a heatmap.

interestingly although gut communities of lake-to-river shrimp ck were separated from that of native lake shrimp c  the three most dominant families bur- kholderiaceae bacillaceae1 and enterococcaceae were the same.

most impressively these gut bacterial surveys from across two habitats revealed modestly diverse gut communities among the shrimp within-group variation sampled from native habitat c and k compared with habitat-exchanged shrimp ck and kc and there were relatively independent betweenshared otus.
