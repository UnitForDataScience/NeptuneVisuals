The finding that gut microbiota dysbiosis is observed in patients effected by neurodegenerative diseases is consistent with earlierPotential areas of interaction between amyloid-producing bacteria and the gut.

It is also critical to recall that the gut has a rich innervation and there are more neurons in the gut than in the spinal cord .

If the gut is the site of origin of neurodegenerative disease path- ogenesis and the gut home to the majority of the human microbiota are there specific micro- bial factors responsible for triggering diseasePersons with Parkinson disease have altered bacterial populations -.

TLRs toll-like receptors.observations that alpha-synuclein pathology may originate in gut neurons and that early brain pathology in Parkinson disease is found in the cell bodies of the neurons innervating the gut the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve .

The bidirectional neuronal pathways between gut and brain provide a mode of entry of agents into the brain from the microbiota that bypasses the circulatory system.

While Prusiner has proposed that the pri- mary misfolding event is stochastic  it has been suggested that the misfolding process asso- ciated with Parkinson disease originates in the gut  .Over the past 10 years a remarkable series of studies has clearly demonstrated the role of a new influence on the brain that of our microbiota .

We are home to trillions of microbes residing inside us and on all of our surfaces with the largest concentration found in the gut .

Moreover it was recently found that enteroendocrine cells which are part of the gut epithelium have properties of neurons and connect directly to alpha-synuclein-containing nerves.
