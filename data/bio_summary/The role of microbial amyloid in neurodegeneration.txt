The finding that gut microbiota dysbiosis is observed in patients effected by neurodegenerative diseases is consistent with earlierPotential areas of interaction between amyloid-producing bacteria and the gut.

TLRs toll-like receptors.observations that alpha-synuclein pathology may originate in gut neurons and that early brain pathology in Parkinson disease is found in the cell bodies of the neurons innervating the gut the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve .

Furthermore microglial cell expression of CD14 is involved in Ass clearance  and innate immune system activation by bacterial amyloid may alter Ass homeostasis in the brain.It has been suggested that exposure to bacterial amyloid proteins in the gut may cause prim- ing of the immune system thereby enhancing immune response to endogenous production of neuronal amyloids in the brain .

Inflammatory responses to the amyloid deposits in the brain may be influenced by the microbiota and this influence may be key to producing cerebral dysfunction .Neural routes by which microbial amyloid may influence the CNS.

It is also critical to recall that the gut has a rich innervation and there are more neurons in the gut than in the spinal cord .

If the gut is the site of origin of neurodegenerative disease path- ogenesis and the gut home to the majority of the human microbiota are there specific micro- bial factors responsible for triggering diseasePersons with Parkinson disease have altered bacterial populations -.

The bidirectional neuronal pathways between gut and brain provide a mode of entry of agents into the brain from the microbiota that bypasses the circulatory system.

Furthermore exposure to microbial amyloids in the gut may enhance cerebral nucleation of Ass aggregates .

Other pathogenic factors originating from the gut in response to influences of the microbiota include cytokines lym- phokines lipopolysaccharides circulating immune cells and hormones that may be delivered to the brain via neural or hematogenous routes .
