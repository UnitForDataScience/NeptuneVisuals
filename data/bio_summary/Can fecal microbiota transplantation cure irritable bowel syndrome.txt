Andrews et al34 Borody et al27 Pinn et al28 and Holvoet et al29 reported improvements in symptoms in 1 3 9 and 9 patients respectively.

The results from Syzenko et al32 and Mazzawi et al33 have also been excluded.

Six out of the 8 RCTs currently listed on clinicaltrials.gov 1532017 use or refer to the Rome III criteria.Holvoet et al29 and Cruz Aguilar et al30 madeefforts to map the GImicrobiome associated with IBS before during and after their trials.

The varying structure of the nine included studies must be taken into consideration.CONCLUSIONData on FMT and IBS are too limited to draw sufficientHalkjaer SI et al .
