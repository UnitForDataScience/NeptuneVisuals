regarding primary diseases the low diversity group included more acute myeloid leukemia patients 66.7 and the high diversity group included more acute lymphoid leukemia pa- tients 22 and myelodysplastic syndrome patients 34.1. furthermore more patients in the low diversity group re- ceived intravenous antibiotics before the conditioning regi- men than the patients in the intermediate and high diversity groups.16s rrna gene sequencingthe otu counts before allo-hsct did not differ between the patients with and without agvhd p  0.46 fig.

patients were clas- sified into three groups based on the diversity index low 2 intermediate 2 3 and high 3 diversity 18 16.8 4844.9 and 41 38.3 patients respectively.

to clarify this point we analyzed intestinal microbiota im- mediately 2 weeks before allo-hsct in 107 adult re- cipients and evaluated the association between pre- transplant microbial diversity and transplant outcomes.patients and methodspatientsthis study was approved by the ethics committee of tokyo metropolitan cancer and infectious diseases center komagome hospital.

subjects consisted of adult patients undergoing allo- hsct in our institution between april 2013 and march 2015. we excluded patients who had received a previous allo-hsct those who did not achieve engraft- ment after allo-hsct and those whose fecal material was insufficient for bacterial dna extraction.transplant procedurestransplant procedures have been described in detail elsewhere .

otu-based microbial diversity was estimated by calculating the shannon diversity in- dex.

patients were classified into three groups based on the diversity index low 2 intermediate 2 3 and high 3 diversity groups.statistical analysisthe probabilities of overall survival os and disease- free survival were estimated using the kaplan-meier product limit method.

for non-agvhd left and agvhd right subjects box plots show- ing the relative abundance of firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria are showndiate diversity group and 41 38.3 patients were in the high diversity group table .

our results demonstrated that low microbial diversity before allo-hsct was not associated with transplant outcomes including acute gastrointestinal gvhd.

to clarify these differences multicenter comparisons are highly needed.in conclusion the present study showed that low microbial diversity before allo-hsct was not associated with transplant outcomes.

the microbial status early after allo-hsct may be more important for predicting transplant outcomes than the status before allo-hsct.

furthermore non-agvhd patients harbored more bacteroidetes before allo-hsct and thus maintaining higher levels of bacteroidetes throughout allo-hsct may be a strat- egy to prevent agvhd.
