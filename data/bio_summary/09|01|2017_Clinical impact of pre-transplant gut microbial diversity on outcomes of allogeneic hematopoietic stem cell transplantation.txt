Furthermore more patients in the low diversity group re- ceived intravenous antibiotics before the conditioning regi- men than the patients in the intermediate and high diversity groups.16S rRNA gene sequencingThe OTU counts before allo-HSCT did not differ between the patients with and without aGVHD p  0.46 Fig.

However the number of these bacteria was very small and the clinical interpretation was unknown.Transplant outcomesAt 20 months after allo-HSCT OS for the low diversity group was 61.1 and was similar to those in the intermediate and high diversity groups intermediate 66.7 high 73.2 p  0.376 Fig.

reported that intestinal microbial diversity at the time of engraftment is associated with mortality and the low diversity group showed a worse outcome compared to inter- mediate and high diversity groups .

Patients were clas- sified into three groups based on the diversity index low 2 intermediate 2 3 and high 3 diversity 18 16.8 4844.9 and 41 38.3 patients respectively.

To clarify this point we analyzed intestinal microbiota im- mediately 2 weeks before allo-HSCT in 107 adult re- cipients and evaluated the association between pre- transplant microbial diversity and transplant outcomes.Patients and methodsPatientsThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.

We excluded patients who had received a previous allo-HSCT those who did not achieve engraft- ment after allo-HSCT and those whose fecal material was insufficient for bacterial DNA extraction.Transplant proceduresTransplant procedures have been described in detail elsewhere .

OTU-based microbial diversity was estimated by calculating the Shannon diversity in- dex.
