the mice were then randomly divided into four groups n  10 per group and supplied a control liquid diet control group con a 4 wv ethanol-containing liquid diet ethanol group etoh a 4 wv ethanol-containing liquid diet supplemented with 0.2 gl lppe low-dose lppe-supplemented group etohl-lppe or a 4 wv ethanol-containing liquid diet supplemented with 0.4 gl lppe high-dose lppe-supplemented group etohh-lppe for 8 weeks.

as shown in  there were no significant differences in the initial bodytable 2. effects of lppe on general parametersweight final body weight or total caloric intake among the four groups p  0.05. ethanol feeding resulted in a significant increase in the liver-to-body weight ratio compared with the con group p  0.05. both l-lppe and h-lppe supplementation significantly decreased the liver-to-body weight ratio compared with the etoh group indicating that lppe supplementation alleviated ethanol-induced liver swelling.effects of lppe on liver histopathology.

also consistent with our findings the consumption of flavanol- enriched mango pulp and red wine polyphenols contributes to health by promoting the recovery of intestinal microbiota in animals consistent with our findings.on the basis of our results the inhibition of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis may be a key mechanism involved in the protective effects of lppe against ethanol-induced liver injury.intestinal microbiota dysbiosis induces dysfunction of the intestinal barrier which subsequently increases the levels of circulating endotoxins.-a prominent feature of alcohol abuseis the dysfunction of the intestinal barrier.

as shown in  ethanol intake led to significantincreases in serum ast and alt activities compared with those in the con group 1.37-fold and 1.36-fold respectively p  0.05. however compared with the etoh group l-lppe and h-lppe supplementation decreased serum ast activity by 27.23 and 36.24 respectively and decreased serum alt activity by 15.80 and 26.90 respectively p  0.05. the results indicated that lppe supplementation alleviated ethanol- induced liver injury.effects of lppe on serum and liver lipid profiles.

intriguingly procyanidin b2 rutin and --epicatechin three major phenolic compositions in lppe-have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory activity in animals.-therefore the present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the hepatoprotective effect of lppe in c57bl6 mice fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet focusing on the link between intestinal microbiota intestinal barrier and hepatic inflammation.materials and methodspreparation and analysis of lppe.

second lppe not only decreased the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction but also prevented liver inflammation that contributes to the hepato- protective effect of lppe in alcohol-fed mice.

conse- quently the results suggested that an inhibition of the endotoxin- tlr4-nf-kb-mediated inflammation in the liver after lppe supplementation may be an effective way to alleviate the ethanol- induced liver injury.based on the above results lppe confers protection against ethanol-induced liver injury in mice by repairing intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing the activation of the endotoxin-tlr4-nf-kb pathway and subsequent inflammation in the liver.

in addition it should be pointed out that humans metabolize flavanols differently than mice or rats and the gut microbiome is involved in these differences.humans also have a microbiota different from rodents.although we have found the benefit of lppe on gut microbiome is an important reason for its hepatoprotection in alcohol-fed mice more studies are needed to determine whether the hepatoprotection can shift to human.in summary the ameliorative effect of lppe on alcoholic liverinjury in mice dose-dependently was associated with the prevention of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction the inactivation of the endotoxin-tlr4-nf- kb pathway and the subsequent repression of inflammation in the liver.

the inflammatory response induced by the imbalance of the gut-liver axis plays an important role in the initiation and development of alcoholic liver injury.-accumulating studies have revealed that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction are common in patients and animals with alcohol-induced liver injury.- chronic alcohol consumption causes intestinal microbiota dysbiosis which results in the dysfunction of the intestinalfinally induce the activation of nuclear factor-kb nf-kb.nf- kb regulates the expression of inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-a tnf-a which in turn triggers liver inflammation.therefore the endotoxin-tlr4-nf-kb path- way is a bridge linking intestinal microbiota intestinal barrier and liver inflammation.
