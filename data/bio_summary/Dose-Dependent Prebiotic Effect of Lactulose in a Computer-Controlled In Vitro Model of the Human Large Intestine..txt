a value equal to 1 white indicates no change a value of 1 green indicates an increase a value of 1 red indicates a decrease of the microbial genera.table 2. the heatmap indicates the average relative number n of the different bacterial genera in the microbiota in the 5 different lactulose conditions 0 g 2 g 3 g 4 g and 5 g respectively after 120 h of exposure in tim-2.

the increasing reddish gradient color indicates the increase in the dominant genera in a particular sample n  1000 the yellowish gradient color indicates the genera that are present at an intermediate level 9  n  1000 while the increasing greenish gradient color represents the genera that are becoming more marginally present in the microbiota n  10.figure 7. column diagram of the bacterial distribution in percentage at the phylum level in control 0 g lactulose and different lactulose dosages 2 g 3 g 4 g and 5 g respectively.

the slight increase in propionate in the 5 g lactulose group compared to the 3 and 4 g lactulose group might be accounted for by a strong increase in levels of other propionate producing bacteria in this dose group like halomonas  compensating for the propionate loss due to lower numbers of prevotella.similarly the increase in lactate which is most prominent in the 4 and 5 g dose groups and surprisingly less extensive in the 5 g dose group compared to the 4 g dose group on day 5 can be explained by the composition of the microbiota.

the microbiota was allowed to adapt to the model conditions and siem for 16 h. after the adaptation period the 120 h test period started in which test product was added to tim-2 in a daily dose.addition of test productthe test product was added to the system at daily doses of 2 g 3 g 4 g and 5 g lactulose mixed in the siem which was added throughout the entire test period.

the usage of naoh was 303 - 28 ml 250 - 19 ml 214 - 7 ml and 154 - 9 ml for theexperiments with 5 g 4 g 3 g and 2 g lactulose respectively.figure 1. sodium hydroxide cosumption during tim-2 runs mean of n  2 lactulose dosages orn  4 control with different dosages of lactulose.

the mean amounts of total scfa produced for the increasing dose of lactulose is 451 - 3 mmol 2 g 399 - 21 mmol 3 g 427 - 76 mmol 4 g and 471 - 12 mmol 5 g for the respective daily doses of lactulose respectively compared to 332 - 34 mmol control.the production profiles from each of the different scfa measured figure b acetate figure c propionate and figure d butyrate indicate that the acetate is the predominantly produced scfa.

bcfa production was 8.4 - 4.2 mmol control 4.6 - 2.2 mmol 2 g lactulose 2.8 - 0.8 mmol 3 g lactulose2.3 - 0.7 mmol 4 g lactulose and 1.5 - 0.2 mmol 5 g lactulose.figure 3. cumulative branched-chain fatty acids bcfa iso-butyrate and iso-valerate production over time during the 120 h test period in tim-2 runs mean of n  2 lactulose dosages or n  4 control.

ammonia production for the different test conditions was 87.0 - 27.9 mmol control 68.8 - 4.7 mmol 2 g lactulose 54.5 - 5.8 mmol 3 g lactulose 28.3 - 12.6 mmol4 g lactulose and 30.5 - 5.1 mmol 5 g lactulose.figure 5. cumulative ammonia production over time during the 120 h test period in tim-2 runs mean of n  2 lactulose dosages or n  4 control.

in healthy individuals daily dosages of 10 g lactulose already exerted beneficial effects on the human microbiota  as did even lower dosages like 4 g  and 3 g .

at 4 g lactulose the reduction in ammonia was as prominent as at a dose of 5 g whereas an increase in relative abundance of bifidobacterium lactobacillus and anaerostipes was most evident in the 5 g lactulose group.

lactate production was 17.9 - 10.0 mmol 3 g 60.7 - 36.2 mmol 4 g 55.7 - 31.0 mmol 5 g for the daily lactulose dose respectively.figure 4. cumulative lactate production over time during the 120 h test period in tim-2 runs mean of n  2 lactulose dosages or n  4 control.

while 2 g lactulose already increased the short-chain fatty acid levels of the intestinal content 5 g lactulose were required daily for 5 days in this study to exert the full beneficial prebiotic effect consisting of higher bacterial counts of bifidobacterium lactobacillus and anaerostipes a rise in acetate butyrate and lactate as well as a decrease in branched-chain fatty acids ph suggested by an increase in naoh usage and ammonia.keywords lactulose microbial fermentation bifidobacteria lactobacilli anaerostipes butyrate ammoniaintroductionlactulose is a synthetic disaccharide consisting of galactose and fructose.

it is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of constipation at doses of 10 to 30 g and the treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy at doses of 60 to 100 g. furthermore lower dosages than 10 g lactulose are used as a functional food ingredient.

the dose effect was clearly visible in the naoh consumption as it was highest for the 5 g dose and decreasing per dose to the 2 g dose.

anaerostipes was not analysed in this trial.in our study the growth support of bifidobacterium was most prominent at 5 g lactulose per day as was the increase in acetate levels while the other effects like increase in butyrate were comparable to the 4 g dose.
