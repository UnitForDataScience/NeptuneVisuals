The heatmap indicates the average relative number n of the different bacterial genera in the microbiota in the 5 different lactulose conditions 0 g 2 g 3 g 4 g and 5 g respectively after 120 h of exposure in TIM-2.

Column diagram of the bacterial distribution in percentage at the phylum level in control 0 g Lactulose and different Lactulose dosages 2 g 3 g 4 g and 5 g respectively.

The slight increase in propionate in the 5 g Lactulose group compared to the 3 and 4 g Lactulose group might be accounted for by a strong increase in levels of other propionate producing bacteria in this dose group like Halomonas  compensating for the propionate loss due to lower numbers of Prevotella.Similarly the increase in lactate which is most prominent in the 4 and 5 g dose groups and surprisingly less extensive in the 5 g dose group compared to the 4 g dose group on day 5 can be explained by the composition of the microbiota.

The microbiota was allowed to adapt to the model conditions and SIEM for 16 h. After the adaptation period the 120 h test period started in which test product was added to TIM-2 in a daily dose.Addition of Test ProductThe test product was added to the system at daily doses of 2 g 3 g 4 g and 5 g Lactulose mixed in the SIEM which was added throughout the entire test period.

The usage of NaOH was 303 - 28 mL 250 - 19 mL 214 - 7 mL and 154 - 9 mL for theexperiments with 5 g 4 g 3 g and 2 g Lactulose respectively.Figure 1.

The mean amounts of total SCFA produced for the increasing dose of Lactulose is 451 - 3 mmol 2 g 399 - 21 mmol 3 g 427 - 76 mmol 4 g and 471 - 12 mmol 5 g for the respective daily doses of Lactulose respectively compared to 332 - 34 mmol control.The production profiles from each of the different SCFA measured Figure b acetate Figure c propionate and Figure d butyrate indicate that the acetate is the predominantly produced SCFA.

BCFA production was 8.4 - 4.2 mmol control 4.6 - 2.2 mmol 2 g Lactulose 2.8 - 0.8 mmol 3 g Lactulose2.3 - 0.7 mmol 4 g Lactulose and 1.5 - 0.2 mmol 5 g Lactulose.Figure 3.

Ammonia production for the different test conditions was 87.0 - 27.9 mmol control 68.8 - 4.7 mmol 2 g Lactulose 54.5 - 5.8 mmol 3 g Lactulose 28.3 - 12.6 mmol4 g Lactulose and 30.5 - 5.1 mmol 5 g Lactulose.Figure 5.

In healthy individuals daily dosages of 10 g Lactulose already exerted beneficial effects on the human microbiota  as did even lower dosages like 4 g  and 3 g .

At 4 g Lactulose the reduction in ammonia was as prominent as at a dose of 5 g whereas an increase in relative abundance of Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus and Anaerostipes was most evident in the 5 g Lactulose group.
