However the peptide neither affected the M2 macrophages and the anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the colon nor the gut microbial dysbiosis observed in colitic mice.During gut inflammation macrophages infiltrate gut tissue in response to pro-inflammatory proteins .

This statement was further validated using Mcp1 knock-out mice Mcp1-- where it has been observed that dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- induced colitis in Mcp1-- mice resulted in downregulation of colonic inflammation compared to their WT counterparts which were associated with a lower number of classical macrophages and CD3 cells in their colon when compared to WT colitic mice .

These macrophages possess distinct characteristics compared to their tissue resident macrophages counterparts and are classified as M1 macrophages  .

M2 macrophages in IBD patients also have defective functioning which is supported by an in vitro study demonstrating that blood macrophages collected from CD patients and stimulated to M2 macrophages resulted in altered expression of CD40 and CD163 compared to healthy cells .

In vitro peritonealmacrophages isolated from naive mice and treated with hCTS 10-5 M 12 h were exposed to either lipopolysaccharide 100 ngml 12 h to polarize M1 macrophages or to IL-4IL-13 20 ngml to polarize M2 macrophages.

These findings suggest that hCTS treatment attenuates the severity of inflammatory relapse through the modulation of the M1 macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Keywords inflammatory bowel disease chromogranin-a catestatin gut inflammation M1 and M2 macrophage gut dysbiosisinTrODUcTiOnInflammatory bowel diseases IBDs are well-known intestinal disorders that are characterized by chronic relapse and remitting stage of inflammation of gastrointestinal tract .

The aims of this study were to determine 1 whether hCTS treatment could attenuate the reactivation of inflammation in adult mice with previously established chronic colitis 2 whether this effect is mediated through macrophages or the gut microbiota.

Conversely hCTS 10-5M treatment neither affected the expression of M2 macrophages markers Arg1 and Ym1  nor the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines Tgfb and Il10 .effect of hcTs on gut MicrobiotaGut microbial dysbiosis is evident in both UC and experimental colitis mice  .

For example in genetically modified mice such as SHP-1 protein tyrosine phosphate- or CD-40-L-deficient mice hyperactive macrophages overexpress Ym1 which results in eosinophilic crystal formation in the lung .

The anti-inflammatory effect of STAT3 also corroborates with mice studies observing that mice having STAT3-deficient macrophages produce excessive cytokine and develop colitis  .
