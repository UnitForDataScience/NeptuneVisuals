c bacterial community profiles determined by shotgun and 16s rrna gene sequencing from a term baby sample v3 j. more detailed information on the number of reads obtained by shotgun and 16s rrna gene sequencing data can be found in additional file and it is the only one which does not have a gc clamp at its 3'end which could also interfere with binding to ge- nomes with high gc content.validation of 16s rrna gene sequencing data using shotgun metagenomic analysisto validate the 16s rrna gene sequencing results we performed shotgun sequencing on paired dna samples from infants ap8c p29f and v3 j. this technology introduces less pcr bias and artefacts but is signifi- cantly more expensive to scale up and requires add- itional computing power for downstream analysis which in large-scale in vivo and clinical studies are important factors to consider.

this also avoided repeated freeze thawing which may increase the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes when using pcr based methods e.g 16s rrna gene sequencing for downstream analysis we then compared three dna extraction protocols involving two different kits to determine the most appropriate method for extracting bacterial dna using two faecal samples from two elbw infants and one term infant sample.

data represented in this table corresponds to three different study groups elbw infant with no supplementation ap8c elbw infant with supplementation p29f and a term infant v3 j. bacterial taxa column indicates the twelve most common bacteria present further details can be found in additional file 16s rrna gene between the latter bacterial genera and bifidobacterium and our data indicate this may nega- tively impact bifidobacterium dna amplification in metagenomic samples.

from a sample collection stand- point shotgun metagenomic sequencing also requires a higher yield of bacterial dna 500 ng is the recom- mended amount of dna compared to 25 ng required for 16s rrna gene sequencing which can bechallenging to obtain from case-specific elbw infants e.g.

notably previous studies examining the gut microbiota using 16s rrna gene sequencing in infants have highlighted that the dna extraction method and the annealing efficiency of the primers used for the amplification step can significantly impact the representative bacterial profile obtained furthermore the 16s rrna hypervariable region v1 to v9 targeted for sequencing influences theability to distinguish between different bacterial taxa and only near-complete 16s rrna sequences give ac- curate measures of taxonomic diversity however the 16s rrna gene 1400 bp is beyond the read length of current short-read high-throughput sequen- cing technologies i.e.

thus we sought to optimise a 16s rrna profiling protocol to allow standardisation for studying elbw infant faecal samples with or without probiotic supplementation.methods using elbw faecal samples we compared three different dna extraction methods and subsequently pcr amplified and sequenced three hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene v1  v2  v3 v4  v5 andv6  v7  v8 and compared two bioinformatics approaches to analyse results otu and paired end.

the dna recovered from these samples was assessed using a qubitr2.0 fluorometer invitrogen.16s rrna gene library preparationfast dna spin kit extracted dna was used for prepar- ing 16s rrna illumina miseq sequencing libraries.

this study demonstrates i the require- ment for an extended bead-beating step during dna extraction from faecal samples and ii sequencing regions v1  v2  v3 and v6  v7  v8 of the 16s rrna gene provide the most representative bacterial profile of the elbw infant gut microbiota.methodssubject recruitment and faecal sample collectionthis study was approved by the university of east anglia uea faculty of medical and health sciences ethics committee and sample collection was in accord- ance with protocols laid out by the national research ethics service nres approved uea biorepository licence no 11208. infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units nicus of the norfolk and norwich university hospital nnuh norwich uk and the rosie hospital cambridge uk were recruited by doctors or nurses with informed and written consent obtained from parents.

nevertheless the limited sequen- cing studies performed so far clearly show a higher abundance of enterobacteriaceae enterococci and staphylococci and a lower abundance of bifidobacteria- ceae and lactobacilli importantly bifidobacteriaceae are a dominant member of the full-term infant micro- biota particularly in vaginally delivered breast-fed infants and are associated with improved host wellbeing and have been used for many years as 'probiotics' therefore probiotic supplementation or micro- biota therapy represents an attractive approach for beneficially manipulating the elbw gut microbiota in order to improve health outcomes 16s rrna sequencing is a common cost-effective amplicon sequencing method that targets variable regions of the gene encoding the bacterial 16 s rrna subunit and can be analysed to determine the bacterial taxa present in a given sample.

we optimised a bacterial dna extraction method for these samples using three different methods and generated amplicons to three different hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene v1  v2  v3 v4  v5 and v6  v7  v8 followed by illumina se- quencing and analysed the samples using two different bioinformatics pipelines otu via qiime versus paired end protocol pe both analysed against the silva data- base.

the dna recovery optimisation procedure indicates that the fast dna spin kit for soil was the most effective method at extracting bacterial dna from elbw infant faeces additional file table s4.

therefore to determine which regions are the best target for elbw infant samples we next prepared three 16s rrna gene sequencing libraries by amplifying different regions of the 16s rrna gene v1  v2  v3 v4  v5 and v6  v7  v8.

furthermore use of the 16s rrnav1  v2  v3 and v6  v7  v8 regions provides reliable representation of elbw microbiota profiles while inclusion of the v4  v5 region may not be appropriate for studies where bifidobacterium constitutes a resident microbiota member.keywords extremely low birth weight infants microbiota 16s rrna gene sequencing shotgun sequencing dna extraction bifidobacterium correspondence 1the gut health and food safety programme quadram institute bioscience norwich research park colney norwich ukfull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec the authors.
