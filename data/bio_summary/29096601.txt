Subject details are included in Additional file Table S1.Sample processing and DNA extractionOptimisation of bacterial DNA extraction was per- formed on faecal samples from two ELBW infants with without supplementation and one term infant sample.Three different DNA extraction methods were usedFastDNA Spin Kit for Soil MP following the manu- facturer's instructions and extending the bead-beating step to 3 min ii QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit Qiagen following the manufacturer's instructions and iii QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit Qiagen including an initial enzymatic lysis step of 1 h at 37 degC enzymatic mix 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 10 mM MgSO4 5 mgmL lysozyme and 50 UmL mutanolysin.

Thus we sought to optimise a 16S rRNA profiling protocol to allow standardisation for studying ELBW infant faecal samples with or without probiotic supplementation.Methods Using ELBW faecal samples we compared three different DNA extraction methods and subsequently PCR amplified and sequenced three hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene V1  V2  V3 V4  V5 andV6  V7  V8 and compared two bioinformatics approaches to analyse results OTU and paired end.

The DNA recovered from these samples was assessed using a Qubitr2.0 fluorometer Invitrogen.16S rRNA gene library preparationFast DNA Spin Kit extracted DNA was used for prepar- ing 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing libraries.

This also avoided repeated freeze thawing which may increase the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes when using PCR based methods e.g 16S rRNA gene sequencing for downstream analysis We then compared three DNA extraction protocols involving two different kits to determine the most appropriate method for extracting bacterial DNA using two faecal samples from two ELBW infants and one term infant sample.

More detailed information on the number of reads obtained by shotgun and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data can be found in Additional file and it is the only one which does not have a GC clamp at its 3'end which could also interfere with binding to ge- nomes with high GC content.Validation of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using shotgun metagenomic analysisTo validate the 16S rRNA gene sequencing results we performed shotgun sequencing on paired DNA samples from infants AP8C P29F and V3 J.

Data represented in this table corresponds to three different study groups ELBW infant with no supplementation AP8C ELBW infant with supplementation P29F and a term infant V3 J. Bacterial taxa column indicates the twelve most common bacteria present further details can be found in Additional file 16S rRNA gene between the latter bacterial genera and Bifidobacterium and our data indicate this may nega- tively impact Bifidobacterium DNA amplification in metagenomic samples.

The DNA recovery optimisation procedure indicates that the Fast DNA Spin Kit for Soil was the most effective method at extracting bacterial DNA from ELBW infant faeces Additional file Table S4.

We optimised a bacterial DNA extraction method for these samples using three different methods and generated amplicons to three different hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene V1  V2  V3 V4  V5 and V6  V7  V8 followed by Illumina se- quencing and analysed the samples using two different bioinformatics pipelines OTU via QIIME versus paired end protocol PE both analysed against the SILVA data- base.

Both NICUs had similar protocols for feeding and the prescription of antibiotics and antifungal drugs.aRHAP1E APBC AP5D AP25E0 0 0 0P29F P30N P31B P35CNNUHV2AV3J00ELBW infant 27 weeks old Birthweight 1 KgNo supplementation Recruited by nursesELBW infant 27 weeks old Birthweight 1 KgWith supplementation Recruited by nursesTerm infants 37 weeks old Birthweight 3 KgRecruited by researchersbQIAmp DNA StoolMini Kit16S rRNA gene hypervariable regionsFast DNA Spin Kit Soil bead-beating 3 min.....DNA extracted with Fast DNA Spin Kit  27FV1V2V3V4V5 519R 530FV6V7VB926R 926F1394Rc.'

Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using a read length up to 2 x 300 bp.Whole genome shotgun metagenomics library preparationGenomic DNA approximately 500 ng from two ELBW infant samples withwithout supplementation and one term infant sample was fragmented to an average size of 250 bp and subjected to DNA library creation using estab- lished Illumina paired end protocols.
