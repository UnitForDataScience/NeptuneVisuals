However a detailed analysis of the origin of liver fat revealed that individuals with high liver fat had more than threefold higher DNL than individuals with low liver fat while having similar levels of adipose flux of FFAs or production of VLDL triglycerides from FFAs 24.

The NAFLD fibrosis score A noninvasive sys- tem that identifies liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.

META-ANALYSIS OF NAFLD PROGRESSIONTo enable better molecular understanding of the progres- sion of NAFLD a meta-analysis methods described in Sup- porting Information Materials and Methods of publicly accessible NAFLD datasets was performed Fig.

Adipokines such as Adiponectin and Resistin usually secreted by adipose tissue but also by HPCs mediate the cross-talk among HSCs HPCs and liver macrophages.There is an urgent need for non-invasive biomarkers of NASH and fibrosis because liver biopsy as the diagnostic gold standard can result in undesirable complications fur- thermore imaging techniques can detect steatosis but not steatohepatitis.

Altered hepatic gene expression in nonalco- holic fatty liver disease is associated with lower hepatic n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids Steatohepatitismetabolic liver disease.

Sources of fatty acids stored in liver and secreted via lipoproteins in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Diagnostic value of biochemical markers FibroTest-FibroSURE for the prediction of liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
