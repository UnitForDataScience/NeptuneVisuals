The distinct well-resolved peaks of sucrose sucralose and glucose enable the differentiation between molecules in the same sample allowing for the determination of kinetic rates of conversion by the enzyme catalysis.Real-time enzymatic conversion of sucrose to glucoseWith the known concentration of the internal reference TSP the integration of the area under the respective peaks of sucrose S glucose P and sucralose allowed for the determination of the rate of change of the reactant and product concentrations .

Popular NAS use the sucrose derivative 1 6-Dichloro-1 6-dideoxy-b-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro- 4-deoxy-a-D-galactopyranoside commonly known as sucralose a disaccharide that has a similar structure to sucrose .

Recently we have implemented an experimental method to monitor the hydrolysis of sucrose via invertase using nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy since the chemical shift of the substrate sucrose is well defined from the product glucose0008-6215c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved..

Equation is used to fit the real-time experimental data obtained for enzyme kinetics using the anal- ysis code written in the R-Statistical environment .ResultsNMR spectral differentiation between sucrose glucose and sucraloseGlucose sucrose and sucralose all have at least one proton with a distinct resonance granting the ability to perform real-time analysis of the enzyme kinetics via NMR spectroscopy.

shows the NMR spectra of sucrose a sucralose b and glucose c. The C1 proton for sucrose shows a double peak doublet close to the resonance frequency of 5.41 ppm while the same proton in the sucralose is shifted downfield to 5.49 ppm.

While the hydrolysis of sucrose occurred in both conditions the concentra- tion of sucralose blue diamonds remained constant in the pres- ence of invertase.Upon creation of a-D-glucose Pa from sucrose the interac-tion with water leads to the mutarotation of a-D-glucose to b-D-glucose Pb as shown in b until an equilibrium is reached between a- and b-anomers of glucose.

The enzymatic conversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose follows the standard Michaelis- Menten enzyme kinetics mechanism e. The enzymatic re- action can be monitored either regarding the substrate sucrose or terms of the product glucose concentration.

An exponential fit  suggests that the catalytic efficiency in units of mM-1 min-1 reduces at a rate of decreases by 50 for every increase in the molar ratio of sucralose to sucrose by 0.87 - 0.15.DiscussionThe first step in the metabolism of sucrose is the conversion to simpler soluble monosaccharide forms glucose and fructose.

The hydrogen bonding of the three hy- droxyl groups at the C4 C10 and C60 positions of sucrose are crucial for the specificity and recognition of the sucrose by invertase .
