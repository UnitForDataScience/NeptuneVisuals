In response to dissatisfaction among providers and patients in July 2013 FDA stated that it would not enforce IND requirements for FMT used to treat CDI unresponsive to therapy allowing physicians and stool banks to operate without an IND.Most recently in March 2016 the FDA published draft guidance 10 stating that it would require stool banks to submit an IND to obtain and distribute stool to physicians.

In evaluating alternatives we considered whether a framework would ensure the safety and effectiveness of the transferred material but also whether it would provide adequate information to patients about benefits and risks ensure access for patients who need the procedure encourage research and development of microbiota-based therapies and support public health objectives to reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance.

Under the proposed FDA guidance stool banks would be nonexistent or would have to operate under an IND.

The IND would not be enforced for physicians collecting and screening donor stool and performing the procedure or for entities such as hospital laboratories that collect and prepare FMT products solely under the direction of licensed health care providers 10 for use by the provider's patients.

This would allow for a continuing supply of stool for patient treatment outside of obtaining stool from a known donor or stool bank.By requiring stool banks to obtain an IND the guidance appears to call for more research in the form of blinded randomized clinical trials moving away from the current FDA position that allows more widespread access to patients with CDI.

Although data would be collected under the proposed IND requirement there are no requirements for such data collection under FDA's current enforcement discretion policy.Our proposed framework has a potential downside.

This assumes that patients would prefer an FMT to a more traditional FDA-approved treatment.

Cost and insurance coverage are likely to play a role in that decision.The proposed framework would be relatively easy to implement.

FDA would need to change its position and determine that microbiota derived from stool is a tissue not a drug or biological product 13.

The framework could be implemented through new guidance or by issuing formal regulations 18 19 and no statutory changes would be required.
