The differences in the energy ingested between groups A and B were due to the energy from BFJs with group B ingesting significantly less energy P  0.001.Group A ingested significantly more total fat P  0.016 and sodium P  0.001 than group B and group B in turn signifi- cantly higher amounts than group C P  0.009 and P  0.002 respectively.

levels betweengroup B and the other groups were observed P  0.003 and Bacteroides-Prevotella levels were significantly higher in group C compared to group B P  0.025 while mice from group A showed intermediate values.The total bacteria levels were significantly higher for group C compared to group B P  0.011 while group A showed intermediate values.The Clostridium leptum subgroup and Clostridium coccoides group showed less variability in groups C and B than those in group A although the median obtained in the three groups was similar.

Group B Mice were fed baby food jar B BFJ-B and RC diet B.

Circles and asterisks represent outlier data.pounds in the RC may cause a substantial reduction in protein and amino acid digestibility42 resulting in the reduction of the protein quality ingested by group C.Therefore taking into account that group C ingested higher amounts of proteins carbohydrates and fiber than groups A and B together with the fact that groups A and B ingested higher amounts of fat than group C Table 2 it can be con- cluded that the weight increase found in this study can be attributed mainly to fat and this nutrient may be a program- ming factor in rapid growth.MicrobiotaThis is the first study to our knowledge which shows GM differences from the consumption of different BFJ brands.Group B showed more significant changes in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes than group A both with respect to groupC.

The second diet group B consisted of baby food jar B BFJ-B 67.5 kcal per 100 g 108 sodium mg per 100 g 3.6 proteins 7.2 carbohydrates 0.5 fibre 86 humidity 2.7 fat and a fatty acid profile 1  2.8  1.7 and RC.

B Mice fed diet B.

From the fifth week of life until the end of the study a greater growth was observed in groups A and B compared with group C with no difference between groups A and B Fig.

Statistically significant differences after performing a Student's t-test between A and B groups P  0.05.BMI and post-weaning growth rate of groups A and B were significantly higher than those of group C.Table 2 shows the results of daily food intake of the three study groups.

Groups A and B exhibited a significant prefer- ence for BFJs over RC with group A consuming significantly more food when compared with group B P  0.033.

The Bifidobacterium genus had a statistical ten- dency to be lower in groups A and B P  0.068.In the case of the Streptococcus tuf gene its presence in groups A and B was detected and no significant differences between them were found.
