After thawing samples were divided into 0.3 g aliquots for DNA extraction and metabolic analysis.Time course ex vivo incubations of fecal samples with SN-38GTo quantify the microbiome metabolism of SN-38G we carried out ex vivo incubation of SN-38G with each fecal sample as follows To remove debris0.3 mg of each fecal sample was mixed with 3 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate- buffered saline homogenized centrifuged at 10000xg for 15 min at 4 degC and the supernatant was collected for further processing.

These results link metabotypes to sets of transporters at the level of metagenome the specific genomes of origin were not resolved.Microbiomes influence drug metabolism in bowel cancer L Guthrie et al.3Community-level microbiome changes in metabolism across metabotypesTo determine whether there are differences in microbial metabolism at the broader level of the entire metagenome between metabotypes we used topological analyses of an enzyme-centric metabolic network.

Differential abundance scores were classified as high metabotype-enriched OR  2 high metabotype associated OR  1 high metabotype-depleted OR  0.5 and high- metabotype-other OR  0.5 and 1 as described previously.To identify KOs that are associated with the high metabotype the abundance of each enzyme in the set of samples obtained from high metabotype individuals was compared with its abundance in low metabotype individuals.Community-level metabolic network constructionTo determine whether high metabotype-enriched enzymes occupy a similar role in the context of a metagenome wide community level metabolism a community-level metabolic network was constructed from the KOs present across all samples.

Thus understanding the mechanisms of microbial mediated drug biotransformation and quantifying the microbial origins of variability in drug response may improve patient treatment outcomes.One of few therapeutic drugs for which we have a mechanistic understanding of how the gut microbiome specifically influences drug metabolism is the colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic and prodrug irinotecan CPT-11.

Most samples from our healthy donors had a low microbiota mediated biotransformation of SN-38G which is consistent with the clinical prevalence of ADRs.Accordingly our data provide the first quantitative experimental evidence that inter-individual variation in total community level microbiome bacterial protein activity can result in differential metabolism of SN-38G.

The authors implicate microbial BGs and hypothesize that Enterobacteriaceae BGs are the major players in both diclofenac- glucuronide and SN-38G metabolism and the resulting adverse responses.Furthermore due to the effectiveness of inhibitors designed against the E. coli BG to reduce irinotecan toxicity in micewe looked at the relationship between the Enterobacter- iaceae family and Enterobacteriaceae-like BGs across samples and found that Enterobacteriaceae-like BGs are widely distributed across samples and incongruent with taxonomic abundance Fig.

We found that high metabotypes and carcinoma patients carry overlapping sets of BGs however more work is needed to assess if BG metabolism in colorectal cancer patients correlates with the same microbiome markers identified here in healthy subjects.Consistent with previous studies profiling the gut microbial community of healthy individuals we found that taxa are relatively stable across the healthy fecal microbiomes at the phylum level and are variable at the family to species levels.Taxonomic variation among healthy individuals favors the hypothesis that the healthy human microbiome may be instead defined by core functional capabilities.These findings lead us to hypothesize that taxonomic diversity and functional traits such as the SN-38G metabotypes might not be linked.

2010 identified potent Escherichia coli BG inhibitors which substantially reduce CPT-11 induced toxicity in mice while having no effect on the orthologous mammalian enzyme.We hypothesized that patterns of BG gene abundance andpotentially other genes present in the gut microbiome are linked to drug metabolism phenotypes and therefore may predict individual patient responses to drugs.

This system also involves a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system PTS an unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase Ugl and ahyaluronate lyase Hyl capable of cleaving glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid for use as a carbon source.The abundance of the PTS system sugar specific EII component in high metabotype samples represents a potential mechanism heretofore unknown by which the glucuronidated drug enters the bacterial cells efficiently.The results here highlight close associations between BG activity phylogenetic diversity and clinically important metabo- lites and provide insight into the broad variability in BG abundance and activity in healthy individuals.

Enterobacteriaceae BGs are more evenly shared ED  0.938 across the samples while the Enterobacteriaceae family members are more variably distributed ED  0.629 across samples independent of metabotypes.Diversity abundance and mobility of BGs across metabotypes We observed that BG gene abundance is variable among healthy subgroups of people Fig.
