prague czech republica faculty of science charles university prague prague czech republicbabstract strain pantoea agglomerans jm1 was isolated from the soil of a micro- biome that had been exposed to polluting pharmaceuticals.

the genome of the strain was assembled and described and the gene encoding valacyclovir-like hy- drolase was identified.he microorganism pantoea agglomerans is a gram-negative motile aerobic enter- obacterium .

some strains of p. agglomerans are commer- cially available as biocontrol agents that reduce the incidence of basal kernel blight of barley fire blight and other diseases mainly caused by the pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas siringae pv.
