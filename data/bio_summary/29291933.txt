Variations in genes involved in gut function abnormal intestinal immune activation chronic gut inflammation and alterations in gut microbiota have been suggested as potential triggers of the disease.

The activation of TLR4 by gut microbiota impacts the enteric nervous system's function and gut mobility.The regulation of gut motility through TLRs seems to be mediated by the modulation of the serotoninergic system in intestinal epithe- lial cells.

REVIEWGut dysbiosis and irritable bowel syndrome The potential role of probioticsNicola Principi  Rita Cozzali  Edoardo Farinelli Andrea Brusaferro  Susanna Esposito a Universita degli Studi di Milano Milan Italyb Pediatric Clinic Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences Universita degli Studi di Perugia Perugia ItalyAccepted 22 December 2017Available online 29 December 2017Abstract Objective To discuss the role of gut dysbiosis in the development of irritable bowel syndrome IBS and the impact of probiotics as a potential therapeutic measure.Methods PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key words irritable bowel syndrome and gut dysbiosis or probiotic.

More than 800 articles were found but only those published in English or providing evidence-based data were included in the evaluation.Differences in the gut microbiota composition between patients with irritable bowel syndrome IBS and healthy controlsWith some exceptions studies comparing the mucosal andor fecal microbiota of patients with IBS and healthy controls have shown that in IBS patients the gut microbiota is glob- ally reduced and has lower diversity than the controls.

Finally evidence showing that differences in the gut microbiota composition between patients and controls could vary according to the IBS subtype further supports the hypothesis that gut microbiota could play a role in conditioning IBS development.

were lower in the rectal biopsies of patients with IBS-D than in those from the IBS-C group and controls numbers per mm of epithelium 24 vs 54 vs 32 p  0.01.Factors that favor the disruption of gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome IBSThe development of IBS has been found to be associated with clinical conditions that can cause significant disruptions in the gut microbiota.

Patients with IBS partic- ularly those with the IBS-D type have frequently abnormal small intestinal permeability.Moreover in vitro studies have shown that the expression of a tight-junction protein ZO-1 in the colonic mucosa was significantly reduced when it was exposed to fecal supernatants from IBS patients.A reduced gut concentration of bacteria that produce butyr- ate a compound derived from the metabolism of short- chain fatty acids SCFA by gut microbiota could contribute to increased intestinal permeability.

The role played by the different gut bacteria in gut motility and the critical importance of dysbiosis in this regard seem to be supported by several studies.

Germ-free rats have delayed intestinal transit and a prolonged interdigestive myoelectric complex period.The colonization of these animals with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bifidobacterium bifidum par- tially increases their gut motility whereas colonization with Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus has the opposite effect.The ways in which the gut bacteria can influence gastro- intestinal motility is poorly understood.

Antibiotic administration reduces and modifies the gut microbiota and at the same time it reduces glial cells within the gut mucosa.
