variations in genes involved in gut function abnormal intestinal immune activation chronic gut inflammation and alterations in gut microbiota have been suggested as potential triggers of the disease.

the activation of tlr4 by gut microbiota impacts the enteric nervous system's function and gut mobility.the regulation of gut motility through tlrs seems to be mediated by the modulation of the serotoninergic system in intestinal epithe- lial cells.

gut dysbiosis seems to be the most convincing because some of the other potential triggers of ibs appear to be directly derived from modifications in the gut microbiota composition.

more than 800 articles were found but only those published in english or providing evidence-based data were included in the evaluation.differences in the gut microbiota composition between patients with irritable bowel syndrome ibs and healthy controlswith some exceptions studies comparing the mucosal andor fecal microbiota of patients with ibs and healthy controls have shown that in ibs patients the gut microbiota is glob- ally reduced and has lower diversity than the controls.

finally evidence showing that differences in the gut microbiota composition between patients and controls could vary according to the ibs subtype further supports the hypothesis that gut microbiota could play a role in conditioning ibs development.

were lower in the rectal biopsies of patients with ibs-d than in those from the ibs-c group and controls numbers per mm of epithelium 24 vs 54 vs 32 p  0.01.factors that favor the disruption of gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome ibsthe development of ibs has been found to be associated with clinical conditions that can cause significant disruptions in the gut microbiota.

patients with ibs partic- ularly those with the ibs-d type have frequently abnormal small intestinal permeability.moreover in vitro studies have shown that the expression of a tight-junction protein zo-1 in the colonic mucosa was significantly reduced when it was exposed to fecal supernatants from ibs patients.a reduced gut concentration of bacteria that produce butyr- ate a compound derived from the metabolism of short- chain fatty acids scfa by gut microbiota could contribute to increased intestinal permeability.

the role played by the different gut bacteria in gut motility and the critical importance of dysbiosis in this regard seem to be supported by several studies.

germ-free rats have delayed intestinal transit and a prolonged interdigestive myoelectric complex period.the colonization of these animals with lactobacillus acidophilus or bifidobacterium bifidum par- tially increases their gut motility whereas colonization with escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus has the opposite effect.the ways in which the gut bacteria can influence gastro- intestinal motility is poorly understood.

antibiotic administration reduces and modifies the gut microbiota and at the same time it reduces glial cells within the gut mucosa.

inflammation was associ- ated with visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension and the administration of dexamethasone reducing inflam- mation for attenuated visceral hypersensitivity.intestinal immune system activity and low-grade gut inflammationthe importance of gut microbiota in the development and function of the immune system is well-demonstrated.indi- viduals with ibs have different immune systems from both a quantitative and a qualitative point of view.

for many years ibs was thought to be a brain-mediated disease that acted through the modulation exerted by the central nervous system cns on the gut via the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis.at present this supposition has been modified and it is thought that although the brain can modulate the microbiota composition its primary role in the genesis of ibs is played by the gut through the influence that the microbiota can exert on the cns.

furthermore neurodegenerative disorders such as parkin- son's disease and alzheimer's disease have been associated with gut microbiota modifications.use of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome ibsthe inclusion of probiotics among the measures used to improve ibs symptoms is justified by the evidence that in both animals and humans with ibs the gut microbiota is quantitatively and qualitatively modified.

in recent years strong evidence of a possible relationship between modifications of the gut microbiota composition and development of ibs has been collected.
