Longitudinal studies of coral microbiome function that go beyond ribosomal marker genes are needed in order to define whether there is a core mi- crobial functional profile that contributes to coral's productivity and long-term fitness.Relationships between bacteria and SymbiodiniumSymbiodinium supports coral nutrition through translocation of 40 to 80 of the photosynthetically fixed carbon to the coral holobiont Hatcher  Muscatine  Tremblay et al.

The development of ecosystem models sensitive to internal dynamics or changes in external forcing will provide the tools to understand and predict the mi- crobial influence on carbon flow in coral reefs Hannah Vezina and John  Kubicek Muhando and Reuter  Kubicek and Reuter .MICROBIAL ROLE IN ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCEPhase shifts from coral to algae dominance in coral reefs are proposed to represent true alternative stable states in coral reefs by numerous non-manipulative studies Knowlton   Hughes .

Next we discuss how the in- tegration of microbial processes in the reef trophic web can im- prove the understanding of coral reef trophic transitions and finally present outstanding questions that should be addressed in future coral reef microbiology studies.MICROBIAL CARBON FLUXES WITHIN HOLOBIONTSCoral holobionts consist of multipartner relationships involv- ing the coral host endosymbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium associated bacteria viruses and other microbes Rohwer et al.

As a result corals display low biomass turnover and mu- cus release is the main pathway for coral primary production to enter the food web Hatcher .The carbon released by Symbiodinium is a rich energy source for coral-associated bacteria and the proportion of coral res- piration that is respired by coral cells compared to coral- associated bacterial cells is unknown Nakajima et al.

Yet direct evidence of mutualistic or antagonistic interac- tions between phage and coral reef organisms is still lacking.Endolithic microorganisms are a poorly understood compo- nent of the coral holobiont represented by a diverse array of Cyanobacteria Fungi other heterotrophic bacteria and archaea plus red and green algae residing inside coral skeletons  .4.

During bleach- ing events when light penetrates deeper into the coral skeleton due to endosymbiont loss increased photosynthetic rates of en- dolithic algae may act as a buffering system provisioning nutri- ents to the coral host and reducing coral mortality Verbruggen and Tribollet .Microbial role on benthic competitionFor photosynthesizing holobionts such as corals and macroal- gae competition for space in the two-dimensional benthic surface is a major ecological interaction Hughes   Lirman  Graham and Nash .

When antibiotics are added coral viability is recovered showing that changes in resident coral microbial communities are responsi- ble for coral death.

Therefore the shift from coral to algae dominance in coral reefs is expected to enrich distinct sediment communities in a simi- lar response to that observed for water column microbes stimu- lated by coral and algae DOC Wild et al.

The extent to which temporal changes in microbial community have an influence in coral disease and competition is still not determined.Manipulation of microbes for coral reef restorationCurrent approaches to intervene in coral reef decline are mostly focused on conservation with the establishment of protec- tion areas with recent increasing efforts targeting restoration.

.In the first section of this review we identify microbial play- ers interactions and processes that contribute to coral reef pro- ductivity with a focus on the coral holobiont.
