These reads as well as publicly available P. destructans and near-relative Pseudogymnoascus and Geomyces species assemblies were aligned to a reference genome from P. destruc- tans 20631-21 NCBI accession no.

Moreover in this analysis isolate JH15CN0111a from China is basal to P. destructans isolates from Mongolia Europe and North America allowing us to root the P. destructans phylogeny .

We thus limited the sample set to just P. destructans and aligned only reads from this species to identify SNP loci shared specifically among P. destructans isolates.

With our current data set the possibility that North American P. destructans was introduced from Asia however seems unlikely.We reduced the sample set once again to include only isolates of P. destructans from North America and reanalyzed the alignments for SNPs.

Average genomic linkage as measured by the standardized index of association indicates that both the European and North American populations of P. destructans are at linkage equilibrium suggesting both populations reproduce primarily as clones.Introduction of P. destructans to North America.

hypothe- sized that P. destructans was a novel pathogen introduced to North America from Europe based upon evidence that North American little brown bats developed WNS when inoculated with a European isolate of P. destructans.

In contrast the high mortality of North American bats infected with P. destructans is consistent with exposure of naive host species to a pathogen preadapted to similar hosts and environmental conditions.Our work supports the hypothesis that P. destructans is a novel pathogen recently introduced to North America by demonstrating the relationship of North American isolates of the fungus to a population dominated by European isolates but genetically distant from isolates from Asia.

In terms of the natural history of P. destructans it will require extensive sampling in Europe to find the population that was introduced to North America.Using two high-resolution genetic characters--SNPs within whole-genome se- quences and microsatellites--we have demonstrated that isolates of P. destructans in North America form a single clade much more closely related to isolates from Europe than to genetically distant populations sampled in Asia.
