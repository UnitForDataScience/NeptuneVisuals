with the explosion of studies relating the microbiome to health and disease this review aims to provide a foundation for clinicians to follow this developing area of biomedical research.introductionthe recent announcement of the united states' national microbiome initiative reflects the rise of microbiome science in the past decade.1 an understanding of how complex microbial communities can influence the pathogenesis of multiple diseases has implications for prevention diagnosis and treatment.

but because this area of microbiology has not traditionally been part of the premedical or medical curriculum2 practicing physicians and those in training often find it hard to understand the increasing attention paid to the microbiome in clinical practice.this review aims to help doctors understand the basics of how the microbiome is being studied and to provide an overview of how knowledge of the structure and function of microbialcommunities may eventually affect the practice of medicine.

for this reason this review will start by discussing some common topics terms and working definitions see box 1.what is the microbiomethe microbiome is defined in box 1. this term is now commonly used when referring to the complex community of microbes that inhabit a specific site on the body9 for example in a discussion of the gut microbiome and its relation to various health and disease states.

the term microbiome refers not only to the microbes but also to the environment that they inhabit.10 using the example above the gut microbiome refers not only to the microbes but also to elements of the host such as the host epithelium immune components and products of both the microbes and host including metabolites.

of particular relevance is the fact that genetic variations in the host machinery that interact with microbes are associated with an increased risk of developing ibd.84 85 thus ibd truly is a microbiome related disease because both the host and microbe and thus the environment created through their interaction are altered in this condition.obesity and metabolic diseasethe complex metabolic interplay between the indigenous microbiota of the intestinal tract and the host has led to an examination of the potential role of the microbiome in metabolic conditions such as obesity and diabetes.

in one study humans with sinusitis had an increase in the abundance of corynebacterium tuberculostearicum which had not been previously recognized as a potential pathogen.113 installation of this organism into a mouse model of sinusitis demonstrated its pathogenic potential.113 further examination of the indigenous microbiota of the upper respiratory tract in patients with and without sinus disease suggested that other members of the indigenous sinus community mediate resistance to colonization by this organism.113other bacteria have been shown to alter local immune responses in the sinuses that are associated with a shift in the resident microbiota.114 in a manner analogous to the interaction between pathogens and the microbiota in the intestinal tract the status of the upper respiratory tract microbiota may be associated with susceptibility to both viral and bacterial upper respiratory tract infections.115 additionally acute upper respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus can alter the microbiota and it has been suggested that this can lead to increased susceptibility to infections elsewhere in the respiratory tract such as otitis media and pneumonia.116emerging treatments the microbiome as a therapeutic targetthe microbiome may play a role in a variety of diseases potentially when a microbial community is deficient in a beneficial function or because of the presence of a detrimental microbial activity.

bacteriophage therapies have been developed that target specific bacterial pathogens and by their very nature they are unlikely to have off-target effects on other members of the microbiota.123 although bacteriophages are known to select for bacterial variants that are resistant these resistant bacteria often have altered surface structures that while leading to phage resistance also attenuate virulence within the host.124 much more work is needed before bacteriophages can be developed into therapeutic agents125 but there is much interest in exploring novel therapies designed to minimize microbiome disruption.probiotics and other live microbial biotherapiesbecause many microbiota related conditions are thought to arise from a deficit in beneficial organisms replacement of missing elements of the microbiota is a strategy that also predates recent attention to the microbiome.

recent studies of the microbiome in particular those that include examination of microbial function have led to the development and preclinical testing of organisms that could be used therapeutically for specific indications.returning to c difficile infection recognition of the importance of bile acid metabolism in the pathogenesis of disease has prompted trials of bile acids bile acid analogs and organisms that could potentially alter bile acid metabolism within the gastrointestinal tract.66-133 although this treatment is still in a developmental stage the paradigm of developing live biotherapeutics on the basis of rationally chosen mechanisms of action will hopefully become an important strategy for the future development of probiotics.prebiotics and diet therapyanother strategy for beneficially modifying the indigenous microbiota is to alter environmental conditions of the microbiome to supply nutrients that favor the growth and predominance of beneficial microbes and their functions.15 134 this strategy has largely been applied to modulating the diet to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota.

in particular there has been much interest in the strategy of transplanting an intact microbial community from a healthy person to one with a microbiota associated disease often referred to as microbiota transplantation.139-141 such treatments date to antiquity particularly transplantation of intact feces or material derived from feces.142 recent interest in fecal microbiota transplantation fmt for the treatment of recurrent c difficile infection has led to several studies of this specific form of microbiome therapy.143 the first report of fmt for the treatment of antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis presumably due to c difficile infection was published in 1958.144 more recently clinical trials of fmt for recurrent c difficile infection have used different preparations of feces145-147 and compared different delivery modalities.148 in one placebo controlled trial the patient's own stool was returned to subjects in the placebo arm.149in general the remarkable success rate of all forms of fmt for recurrent c difficile infection has generated excitement thatof spore forming organisms may not necessarily be successful in other conditions.the therapeutic future precision microbiome therapyin the future therapeutic approaches are likely to become embedded in precision medicine.153 precision medicine has largely focused on host variables that can influence health and the response to treatment such as host genetics but because the indigenous microbiota can play a key role the precision medicine paradigm can be expanded to include these microbial variables.

key associations between specific changes in the microbiome and disease will be discussed.

because interest in the microbiome spans several biomedical disciplines detailed discussion of many topics is not possible.
