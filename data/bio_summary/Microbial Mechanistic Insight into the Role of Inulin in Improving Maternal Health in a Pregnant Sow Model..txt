common otus for lfd-hfd and hfd.inu-lfd.inu pairs increased from 1327 and 1332 on d30 of gestation to 1466 and 1856 on d110 of gestation respectively figures 3a-d. there was no dietary effect or interaction effect on the numbers of observed species at each gestation stage figure 3e.to assess fecal microbial community structure richness chao 1 index and diversity simpson index were calculated figure 4. for the chao 1 index gestation stage exhibited significant effect on it with data on d110 of gestation being much higher than any other stages p  0.01. there was an interactive effect between fat level and gestation stage p  0.02. a remarkable increment in simpson index with inulin supplementation was found in the present study p  0.02. interative effect between fat and inulin level on simpson index p  0.01 was also detected to provide the view that inulin addition could effectively improve the decline of simpson index induced by high fat addition.changes of the relative abundance at phylum levelthe relative abundances at phylum level of all samples during gestation were present in figure s2 suggesting thatthe top five dominated phyla were firmicutes bacteroidetes spirochaetes tenericutes and proteobacteria.

sows were regarded as the experimental units n  5 for each treatment at each gestation stage except for lfd group with n  4 on d90 and d110 of gestation due to an unexplained diarrhea on d88 of gestation which lasted for 2 days.

inu.during gestation all sows were fed the same amount of feed during the whole gestation.

one sow from lfd group had an unexplained diarrhea on d88 of gestation which lasted for 2 days therefore its fecal samples for vfa and microbial analyses on d90 and d110 of gestation were excluded from the present study.

sow body weight and backfat changes during gestation were shown in figure 1. from mating to parturition body weight and backfat thickness did not differ p  0.05 between treatments at any time point except that inulin addition significantly reduced the backfat thickness on d112 of gestation compared to non-inulin addition group 16.20 vs. 18.80 p  0.05. in view of the changes for the wholegestation fat addition dramatically increased the total bw gain 22 maternal bw gain 34 and backfat gain 44 p  0.01. on the contrary inulin addition reduced maternal bw gain -10 p  0.04 and backfat gain -43 p  0.01 and also showed remarkable interactive effects with fat level on total bw p  0.03 maternal bw p  0.02 and backfat gain p  0.02. these interactive effects indicated the lowering effects of inulin were prominent in hfd.inu group with 19 18 and 56 reduction for total bw maternal bw and backfat gain respectively compared to hfd group p  0.05.changes in the concentration of maternal blood inflammatory indices and adipokines in serum and backfat tissues at perinatal periodas shown in figure 2a inulin addition significantly decreased the concentration of serum pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 90.48 vs. 111.60 ngl p  0.04 and tended to increase that of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 180.53 vs. 158.23 nglp  0.06. as for the adipokines figures 2b-d fat addition increased the serum leptin 23.18 vs. 17.30 ngml p  0.01 while inulin resulted in a remarkable reduction in it 15.80 vs. 24.69 ngml p  0.01. interactive effect between fat and inulin p  0.01 was also found for serum leptin indicating an improving effect of inulin addition upon high fat treatment.

nine phyla 1 in at least one sample and firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio were chosen for significance analyses table 3. high fat treatment decreased the relative abundance of proteobacteria p  0.04 tended to decrease the relative abundance of bacteroidetes p  0.06 and tended to increase the relative abundance of actinobacteria p  0.08 and firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio p  0.07. inulin supplementation increased the relative abundance of lentisphaerae p  0.02 and tended to decrease the relative abundance of tenericutes p  0.09. all phyla were significantly affected by gestation stage p  0.05 respectively indicating that they varied a lot from early even from late gestation to perinatal period.

the majority of genera were affected by gestation stage indicating that their relative abundances changed greatly over the pregnancy progress in particular when reaching the perinatal period.changes of the relative abundance of representative vfa-producing related generaas shown in figure 5 fat addition markedly increased the abundance of lactococcus p  0.02. despite numerical increases were found for most vfa-producing genera by inulinaddition only genus eubacterium-hallii-group significantly increased p  0.04. remarkable increase of bacteroides table 4 p  0.01 whose main fermentative product is propionate and notable decreases of roseburia and anaerostipes p  0.01 whose main fermentative products are butyrate were detected from d90 of gestation to the perinatal period.

sows were regarded as the experimental units n  5 for each treatment at each gestation stage except for lfd group with n  4 on d90 and d110 of gestation due to an unexplained diarrhea on d88 of gestationwhich lasted for 2 days.

this finding underscores the efficacy of different dietary treatments on modifying the gut microbiota.at either phylum or genus level results obtained on d110 of gestation showed striking differences from other gestation stages.

2009. it is common recognized that the latter stage of gestation is characterized by a diabetogenic state in the mother to support the continuous supply of nutrients to the fetus and an elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines mor and cardenas 2010. increases of these two phyla provide us the insight into the microbial mechanism under which the mother performs some degree of inflammation during late gestation.
