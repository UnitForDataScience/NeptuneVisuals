Approximately 39  of all identified nonredundant proteins were detected in the phyllospheres of all tree species in our study whereas approx- imately 7  of all nonredundant proteins were observed only in the phyllosphere of T. serratifolia 2  in the phyllosphere of M. schottiana and 2  in the phyllospheres of the Ocotea species Supplementary Material Table S4.The most abundant Pfam domains in the phyllospheres ofM.

Notwithstanding the characterization of the evolutionary mechanisms of the phyllosphere bacteria associated with plant species from distinct environments is essential for better un- derstanding of the mechanisms controlling their interactions on plant surfaces.The assignments of the identified proteins to bacterial tax- onomic groups using Unipept  revealed that approximately 80  of the proteins were similar to proteins from the species of Gammaproteobacteria Supplementary Material Fig.

Comparing the Pfam domains of the 20 most abundant proteins in the phyllospheres of the Atlantic Forest trees to the Pfam domains of the 20 most abundant proteins in the phyllospheres of soy- bean clover and Arabidopsis  and to the 20 most abundant Pfam domains enriched in the phyllosphere of rice  we observed that no Pfam domain was shared among all phyllospheres Supplementary Material Fig.

S8 suggesting that the lack of proteins assigned to Alphaproteobacteria in our samples may be due to the relatively higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria proteins in the protein databases as well as to the fact that proteins from Alphaproteobacteria were among the nonidentified peptides to a high proportion of uncharacterized Alphaproteobacteria species in our communities andor to different metabolic activities of bacte- rial groups within the communities.

Similarly Knief et al.detected no proteins involved in biological nitrogen fix- ation in the rice phyllosphere although the genes encoding proteins of the nitrogenase complex were detected in its phyllosphere metagenome.Cell MotilityOne of the most abundant proteins detected in the phyllospheres of M. schottiana O. dispersa O. teleiandra and T. serratifolia was a bacterial flagellin Pf12445 most likely involved in cell motility.

In the phyllosphere microorganisms have had to develop specific mechanisms to cope with such environmental stresses in order to successfully colonize the leaf surface and form biofilms.In Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 the ability to colo- nize plant surfaces is associated with the expression of a global response regulator called PhyR  which regulates the accu- mulation of several proteins involved in reactive oxygen spe- cies ROS homeostasis such as catalase KatE superoxide dismutase SodA alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC thioredoxins organic hydroperoxide resistance protein-like protein Ohr DNA protection protein Dps and heat shock proteins among other proteins associated with stress responses .

It is possible that its abundance was below the detection levels of our study since Methylobacterium was present at low abundances but no iden- tified proteins have been assigned to Alphaproteobacteria.Three other stress-related proteins were detected in the phyllospheres of M. schottiana O. dispersa O. teleiandra and T. serratifolia i.e.

In contrast to prior studies on crop plants and Arabidopsis a low abundance of OTUs related to Methylobacterium and no proteins associated with the metab- olism of one-carbon molecules were detected in the phyllospheres of the tree species studied here.

Peptide mass spectra were deposited in the PRIDE database  under accession number PXD002246 doi .Results and DiscussionWe evaluated the taxonomic composition and metaproteomes of bacterial communities in the phyllospheres of several tree species in an experimental preserve of a pristine Atlantic Forest using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and LC- ESI-Q-TOF of trypsin-digested proteins respectively.16S rRNA Gene SequencingWe acquired a total of 9260 valid GS-FLX sequences after omission of reads with missing primers or DNA tags se- quences containing more than one ambiguous base or shorter than 200 nucleotides or representing chimeric and putative chloroplast sequences.

Even though data on leaf growth rates and longevity for the trees sampled in our study are not available it is plausible that OTUs related to Methylobacterium are more abundant on the surface of young leaves and in the phyllosphere of plants with a short lifespan such as most of agricultural plants than in mature leaves of perennial species and mature trees.Although diverse bacterial taxa composed the phyllosphere communities in our study all phyllospheres shared a core set of proteins involved in processes that are essential for growth and maintenance of biofilms on the leaf surface.
