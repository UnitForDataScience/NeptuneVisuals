To test whether the changes had a role in ageing Valenzano and his colleagues transplanted gut microbes from 6-week-old fish into middle- aged 9.5-week-old fish.First they gave the middle-aged fish antibi- otics to clear out their gut flora and then put them in a sterile aquarium with the gut contents of young fish for 12 hours.

But the latest study looked at the effect of transplant- ing gut microbiomes.

Killifish don't usually eat faeces Valenzano notes but they bit at the gut contents ingesting microbes in the process.

At 16 weeks old the middle- aged fish that received 'young microbes' had gut microbiomes that resembled those of the 6-week-olds.
