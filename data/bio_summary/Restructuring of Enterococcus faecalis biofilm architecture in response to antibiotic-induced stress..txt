We also provide evidence that exposure of parent biofilms to subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics results in restructuring of biofilms into a complex three- dimensional 3D architecture reminiscent of DepaOX biofilms grown in the absence of antibiotics.

faecalis restructures into microcolony biofilms in response to antibioticsTo determine the impact of antibiotics on established biofilms we cultured parent and DepaOX strains in CBRs for 24 h without antibiotic and then exposed the resulting biofilms to antibiotic and examined architecture using SEM.

SEM micrographs showed that the biofilms of the DepaOX mutant remained the same throughout the 48 h time course with cells chaining clumping and forming complex 3D biofilms Fig.

While increased biofilm detachment could be advantageous for bacterial dissemination during infection detachment could be disadvanta- geous for E. faecalis by making the detached bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics or the immune response.Microcolony formation in CBR grown E. faecalis biofilms could be viewed as a stress response where the source of stress for parent biofilms is antibiotics while DepaOX mutant cells may be experiencing increased stress in the absence of antibiotics due to cell envelope defects.

The antibiotics used were chosen based on clinical relevance and the concentrations were chosen based on previous results demonstrating that these concentrations were subinhibitory for planktonic growth.In the absence of antibiotics parent cells formed monolayer biofilms that resulted in the formation of occasional microcolonies greater than two cells in depth after 48 h of growth.

In total these data suggest that parent restructuring from monolayers into microcolonies is mediated by the division or rearrangement of bacterial cells attached prior to antibiotic treatment vs. new colonization by planktonic cells in the CBR vessel.Microcolony biofilms show reduced structural integrity relative to monolayer biofilmsWhile removing samples from the CBRs for imaging we observed turbidity differences between parent and DepaOX in the liquid phase of the CBR cultures following antibiotic exposure.

In addition the structural stability of E. faecalis biofilms exhibiting increased 3D cellular architecture is significantly diminished relative to monolayer biofilms even though biofilm biomass is not reduced.

In addition DepaOX biofilms were much less stable overall than parent biofilms in both the absence andBiofilm restructuring in E. faecalisJL Dale et al.4Fig.
