Finally as advanced age is associated with both muscle loss sarcopenia and microbiome dybiosis such a therapeutic approach holds the potential of slowing the onset of several metabolic and structuraldeficits inflicted by aging in elderly people.The potential for precise therapeutic interventions that target microbial-mitochondrial metabolic communication provides a novel avenue for the treatment of many metabolic disturbances and could have profound implications for the future of medical treatments.

Pomegranate ellagitannins stimulate growth of gut bacteria in vitro implications for prebiotic and metabolic effects.

A stable symbiosis was established given the metabolic versatility of the early mitochondria which were capable of pro- viding energy with or without oxygen whereas nutrient gathering was the assumed responsibility of the host.

Cell-cell communication between mi- crobes and single-cell protists was augmented through multicellularity to allow dis- tant communication between the host cells and the microbiome resulting in the de- velopment of complex metabolic relationships and an immune system to manage these interactions.

We humans are care- takers of a profoundly vast and diverse microbiota the majority of which resides in the gut.

Modern clinical science has elegantly highlighted the importance of the microbiome for metabolic health and well-being.

This perspective underscores one fundamental facet of this symbiosis the ancestral mitochondrion-microbiome axis.KEYWORDS SCFA butyrate ellagitannins lactate metabolic microbiome mitochondria muscle short-chain fatty acids urolithin Autrient metabolism is a function shared by both the microbiome and mitochon- dria.

In recent years it has become increasingly evident that the gut microbiome produces metabolites that influence mitochondrial function and biogenesis i.e.

It is thus not surprising that the same bacteria that generate these compounds are also able to confer resistance to metabolic disturbance .

There are therefore explicit and implicit interactions between lactobacilli bifidobacteria SCFA- producing bacterial strains and the metabolites they produce that have broad systemic metabolic ramifications if the correct tissues are targeted.Metabolic health and mitochondrial health are synonymous.
