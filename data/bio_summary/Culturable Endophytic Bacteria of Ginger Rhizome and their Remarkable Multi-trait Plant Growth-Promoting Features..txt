previous reports on endophytic bacteria from phaseolus vulgaris  salvia miltiorrhiza  zea mays  sorghum bicolor  and glycine max  are sup- portive to the obtained result.in the present study 12 different media were used for the isolation of endophytic bacteria which influenced the number and diversity of obtained cultivable bacteria.

thus the plant growth-promoting property of endophytic microorganisms will be successful if the isolate can keep a balance on regula- tion of various pgp traits.in the current study plant growth analysis revealed the ability of endophytic bacteria to enhance growth of v. unguiculata.

this makes studies on plant growth- promoting endophytic bacteria highly attractive to make use of them as agents for plant growth enhancement.in the current study zingiber officinale ginger with tra- ditional medicinal applications was selected as the source for isolation of endophytes.

in the study 96 endophytic bacteria isolated from rhizome of ginger zingiber officinale were screened for phosphate solubilisation 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate acc deaminase activity nitrogen fixa- tion ammonia and iaa production.

diverse functions inplants including the regulation of turgor pressure function of stomata improvement of root development and general health are increasingly being identified to be regulated by endophytic bacteria .

its excellent chemical profile vegetative propagation and soil-associated nature make it to have the likely presence and support from large number of endophytic bacteria which can have rhizome-beneficial mechanisms.

namely rio-de janeiro vellanikkara ii mahima and ginger rhizome of accession number se-8681 were collected from kerala agricultural university kerala and were used for the isolation of endophytic bacteria as per previously described method  using 12 different media.

in our study the highest number of endophytic bacteria was obtained from trypticase soy agar a complex media sup- plementary table 1.among 96 isolates screened 33 34 showed phos- phate solubilisation 69 71.8 were acc deaminase pos- itive 38 39.58 produced iaa 44 45.83 were nitro- gen fixation positive and 60 62.5 produced ammonia.among these 16 isolates zob1 3 15 19 20 21 22 3334 37 47 67 69 74 82 and 86 with multiple plant ben- eficial features were selected for detailed study.

the results are indicative of their modulatory effect on soil nutrients.discussionin the present study a maximum of 96 culturable endophytic bacteria could be isolated from the rhizomes of z. offici- nale.

in our study highest number of endophytic bacteria was obtained on tryptone soy agar a complex media.table 1 effect of selected bacterial isolates on the vigna unguiculatadata represented as mean -sd.

these reports are comparable with the results of the current study which indicates that the endophytic bacteria have evolved adaptations for the life within the host tissue.
