To adjust for multiple com- parisons a false-discovery rate adjusted P value was calculated for each analysis.743.e2Letters  Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 118 2017 726e748eTable 1Dietary Information For Children From Cape Town South Africa With and without AD and Food SensitizationaAbbreviations ANOVA analysis of variance RAE retinol activity equivalent.aData expressed as median calculated interquartile unless otherwise noted nutrient data expressed as intake per day.eTable 2Relative Abundance of Sequences Derived From Individual TaxaAbbreviations AD atopic dermatitis FDR false discovery rate.aAlthough there was a trend toward higher relative abundance of bacteria from the phylum Actinobacteria in the children with AD compared with controls P 14 .04 after adjusting for multiple comparisons this was not significant FDR P 14 .17.bAt the taxonomic level of genus the relative abundance of Blautia was higher in children with AD than in control children P 14 .01 but after adjusting the analyses with FDR this was not significant FDR P 14 .19.cAt the taxonomic level of phylum the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was higher in food sensitized cases compared with atopic cases without food sensitization or controls although this difference was not significant P 14 .02 FDR P 14 .08.dThe relative abundance of Blautia P 14 .04 FDR P 14 .27 and Bifidobacterium P 14 .01 FDR P 14 .20 were higher in food sensitized than nonsensitized children but after FDR correction was not significant.eThe 24- to 36-month-old children had higher relative abundance of the genus level taxa Oscillospira than the 12- to 24-month-old children but after FDR correction this was not significant P 14 .02 FDR P 14 .33.

This trend continued at the taxonomic level of genus where the relative abundance of Blautia P .04 FDR P .27 and Bifidobacterium P .01 FDR P .20 were higher in food sensitized than non- sensitized children but after FDR correction was not significant.Breastfeeding or no breastfeeding at all had no effect on the gut microbiota atages 12 to 36 months.

Analysis of similarity at the taxonomic level of genus was not significant when comparing patients with AD and controls global R 14 0.124 P 14 .096 food sensitized vs nonsensitized global R 14 0.002 P 14 .43 breastfed vs nonbreastfed global R 14 0.019 P 14 .34 or higher fiber consumers vs low fiber consumers global R 14 -0.025 P 14 .76.

At the taxonomic level of phylum the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was higher in food sensitized cases compared with patients with AD without food sensitization or controls although this difference was not statistically significant P .02 FDR P .08.

A false-discovery rate FDRe adjusted P value was calculated for each analysis to adjust for mul- tiple comparisons.

Statistical significance was set at P .05.This study was approved by the institutional review boards ofthe University of Cape Town's Faculty of Health Sciences and of Rush University Medical Center.

However post hoc power analysis for our primary end point the difference in the species richness between children with AD and control toddlers revealed that we had a power of 78.7 to find a difference under P .05.
