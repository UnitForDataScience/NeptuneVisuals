however post hoc power analysis for our primary end point the difference in the species richness between children with ad and control toddlers revealed that we had a power of 78.7 to find a difference under p .05. another possible explanation for this lack of association between ad and microbiota composition in our cohort is that in this african population ad is mainly influenced by other factors such as skin barrier integrity or other predisposing genetic factors.

in common with many atopic diseases the prevalence of ad has been increasing across the world.one of the theories for this increase is increased hygiene and urbanization-related changes in the environment which can affect the human microbiome.previous studies have found associations between the composition of the early gut microbiome and development of atopic conditions including ad.

although the rate of atopic conditions including ad and food al- lergy is increasing on all continents the prevalence of these diseases is still lower in african countries.this is especially interesting because individuals of african origin who live in western countries such as african americans are at a higher risk for severe ad.this variation places africa in a special position studying african pop- ulations is necessary not only to find ways to prevent increases of allergy conditions in african countries but also to provide important clues to the causes of this global increasing of allergic conditions.young children who have developed ad in african communities with a low incidence of atopic disease might be the transitional group.

total fiber intake had no effect on the gut microbiota.to assess the association between fecal microbiota and age we pooled data for all individuals total of 38 african black childrenwith and without ad and categorized the children based on their age to those children aged 12 to 24 months n15 and 24 to 36 months n 23 which were found to have similar gut microbiota .this pilot study found no major differences in the composition of the gut microbiota of 12- to 36-month-old children with and without ad.

the lack of association of ad or food sensitization with changes in the gut microbiota at 12 to 36 months indicates that the underlying mecha- nism of ad in this population might be related to other factors or bacterial microbiota composition during the first 12 months of life only.the main limitation of our study is the small number of par- ticipants which might have affected our results limited the ability to conduct subgroup analyses and affected the power of the ana- lyses.

in the current study we have for the first time to our knowledge analyzed the fecal microbiota composition of a group of young black african children aged 12 to 36 months old with and without ad living in the same community in cape town south africa.

our primary goal was to examine whether toddlers with ad and control toddlers from cape town have different microbiomes in terms of bacterial richness and diversity.

briefly children 12 to 36 months old with ad and a group of nonallergic control children were recruited from the pediatric dermatology department of the red cross war memorial children's hospital and child care facilities in the cape town metropole.

written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian for all participants.the study included 29 children with ad and 9 control children.

the ad and control groups had no significant differences with re- gard to age body mass index and sex distribution.

among the children with ad 17 were sensitized to at least 1 food and 11 weredisclosures authors have nothing to disclose.funding sources this is supported by a junior investigator grant from brinson foundation and a cohn scholarship from the rush university mentoring office dr mahdavinia and by grants r01 at007143-05 r01 aa023417-02 and r01 aa020216-05 from the national institutes of health dr keshavarzian.not sensitized to any of the foods tested.

all control children had negative skin test results to foods .there was no difference between patients with ad and controls in terms of being breastfed at all or duration of breastfeeding.
