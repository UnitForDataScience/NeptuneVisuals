The default reference sequences are the standard full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of Escherichia coli GenBank accession number J01695 and the corresponding sequence of Methanomethylovorans hollandica GenBank accession number NC019977 and the 18S rRNA gene sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GenBank accession number NR132213.1.

To obtain SSU rRNA gene-like sequences in metagenome datasets 71 representative sequences 45 bacterial 17 archaeal and 9 eukaryotic sequences were obtained by clustering the SILVA SSU database v102 with Usearch v5.2.32  at a sequence identity level of 75.

The sequences were checked for chimeric artifacts using the chimera.uchime in Mothur v1.33.3 and the passed sequences were processed with MIPE metatranscriptome search score cutoff 20 bootstrap cutoff 80.Results and discussionExtraction and taxonomic identification of SSU sequencesRunning time of MIPE CPU time was tested using the 13-organism genomic mock dataset con- taining 1000000 sequences.

If the sequence is classified into Bacteria Archaea or Eukarya and the bootstrap value is not less than the threshold cutoff Mothur declares a minimum cutoff of 60 and 50 is also used for sequences shorter than 250 bp  the sequence passes through to the next analysis.Alternatively the first step can be the sequence screening and taxonomy of a metatranscrip- tome.

The user-defined SSU sequences and the reference sequence are combined and aligned against the aligned the SILVA SSU database v119 using the multiple-sequence aligner align.seqs in Mothur v1.33.3 so that every base is given a unique position on the reference sequence.Users would make a list of degenerate primers as input and make sure both their degenerateand non-degenerate formats have right primer binding sites on the reference sequence.

For the analysis of metatranscriptome and amplified rRNA gene sequences MIPE skips this step and runs the main program directly because rRNA gene sequences constitute a large part of these datasets.

However some rRNA sequences in some metatranscriptomic samples are removed for mRNA enrichment in these cases using the metagenome workflow would be a wise choice and these rRNA sequences cannot be used to reflect the community.

The primers are then re-aligned against the primer binding sites obtained from the user-defined sequences to improve the alignment quality and the sequences that are poorly aligned in this region are deleted.

Because metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences are generated without PCR-based amplification the rRNA sequences in these datasets are used for the microbial population analysis .

In conclusion MIPE can efficiently extract SSU rRNA gene sequences from metagenome datasets and accu- rately identify the taxonomy of each sequence.The metatranscriptomic dataset SRX155355 contains 21035 sequences prior to processing by MIPE.
