Reduction in FHI-2571-mediated ghrelin receptor activation following exposure to acidic pH confirms the need for an oral delivery mechanism Control  FHI-2571 not exposed to acidic pH RFU  Relative Fluorescence Units.loss in peptide activity is observed for the whey-derived FHI-2571  confirming the requirement for a protective film coat to minimise exposure to gastric acid before progression to in vivo efficacy studies.Aqueous-based ethylcellulose dispersion yields a mechanically weakfilm coatingUSP Type 1 Basket dissolution studies were carried out in both simulated gastric conditions simulated gastric fluid SGFsp pH 1.2 in order to assess the release profile of peptide from the pellets.

Considering the high loading of peptide in our system 33 this problem is compounded leading to pellet swelling and film fracture.Here we demonstrate the mechanical integrity of two alternative film coating approaches which both provide time-dependent release of a bioactive peptide in the in vitro setting.

Pellets displayed burst release of the peptide with  80 release over the first 60 min.

Scanning Electron Microscope SEM images of whole pellets.SEM images of uncoated A aqueous ethylcellulose EC coated B ethanolic EC coated C and dual-coated pellets D.Investigation of peptide release in pH transfer modelA pH transfer model was utilised in order to investigate whether there was any appreciable difference in release when intestinal pH was introduced to the pellets after 2 h exposure to SGFsp pH 1.2 condi- tions .

Predictably the aqueous EC-coated pellets display a burst release of peptide with  80 release in the first hour.

This is supported by SEM images  which show a distinct porous nature to the cross sec- tionedaqueous-based film coat B compared to a more complete non-permeable structure seen in the ethanolic-based film coat D. Consistent with the impervious nature of the coat show in SEM cross- sections FHI-2571 -loaded pellets coated with an ethanolic solution of EC displayed near-zero order release in both USP Type 1 Basket and USP Type 4 Flow-through dissolution setups  .Due to the drawbacks associated with organic-based coating solu-tions an aqueous -based coating approach to achieving an appropriate release profile of active peptide was desirable.

The aqueous-based EC coated pellets de- monstrated a lag time prior to disintegration where the frequency minimum is observed at 780 s. This result indicates that the aqueous- based EC pellets do not remain intact in an acidic environment and further support findings from previous dissolution experiments see A.Ghrelin receptor activity post-encapsulationIn order to quantify the impact of processing conditions on bioac- tivity of the peptide cargos activity of the encapsulated peptide in vitro was reassessed.

Activity assays confirmthat the peptide retains good bioactive functionality post-encapsulation.Materials and methodsMaterialsDairy-derived peptide hydrolysate FHI-2571 was provided by Food for Health Ireland see Section 2.2.

In our study peptide liberated from the pellet formulation displays  80 activity of the untreated peptide.
