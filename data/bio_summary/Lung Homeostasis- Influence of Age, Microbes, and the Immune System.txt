This concept of ''innate immune memory'' stems from observations that organisms that lack adaptive immune systems such as plants and invertebrates can generate resistance to infection as well as vaccination studies that show protection from reinfec- tion can occur when T and B cells are lacking This antigen nonspecific innate immune memory depends on the nature and sequence of exposure to immune stimuli and might explain why secondary bacterial infections are relatively common following viral infections.

Pulmonary immune homeostasis is maintained by a network of tissue-resident cells that continually monitor the external environment and in health instruct tolerance to innocuous inhaled particles while ensuring that efficient and rapid immune responses can be mounted against invading pathogens.

In this context we examine the current understanding of the impact of the microbiota in immune development and function and in the setting of the threshold for immune responses that maintains the balance between tolerance and chronic inflammation in the lung.

We propose that host interactions with microbes are critical for estab- lishing the immune landscape of the lungs.IntroductionMaturation of the pulmonary immune system occurs in an anti- gen-rich postnatal environment.

Although this early life immune pro- gramming likely has implications for lifelong immune health there is little mechanistic evidence identifying underlying molecular pathways.

Disturbance of microbes present at mucosal surfaces by inappropriate or serial antibiotic usage also affects immune development and might cause a microbe that is normally a commensal to become pathogenic.The environment that a child grows up in also has a part to play in the education of the respiratory immune system because epidemiological studies show that premature birth birth order number of siblings living with pets living next to a major road and parental smoking all increase the risks for developing lung disease in later life.

In addition to this barrier function the pulmonary epithelium is immunologi-cally active and is pivotal in the regula- tion of immune responses in the lung .Pulmonary epithelial cells are able to secrete a wide range of cytokines and chemokines as well as being in intimate contact with cells of the immune system.

Many of the mole- cules secreted by epithelial cells in response to danger have the ability to regulate immune reactions and recruit cells of the innate and adaptive immune system.

In fact the presence of ''pathogens'' or perhaps more correctly ''patho- bionts''--which are members of the microbiota that stimulate the immune system even in the absence of overt inflammation but can cause disease if they bloom and there is consequently bacterial dysbiosis--might be central to a balanced immune system.

Although the molecularmechanisms that result in increased immune responses are not known it is thought that these environmental ''triggers'' initiate a series of reactions starting with the epithelium.Metabolism and Nutrition Key Mediators of the Gut-Lung AxisNutrition is a central parameter governing gut health however a growing body of literature also shows that diet impacts the systemic immune system and lung inflammation.
