M cells are known to transport a broad range of particulate materials including inert particles435657 and pathogens.4458 Recent work shows that the presence of M cells induced by Raji cells in a Caco-2 cell model increased the translocation of solid lipid nanoparti- cles ranging in size from 50 to 70 nm with different surface modifications.59 However transport through M cells does not necessarily mean that the nanoma- terials reach the bloodstream as M cells are closely associated with immune cells.

Interspersed between enterocytes are goblet cells that secrete mucus into the gut lumen and thereby provide an additional barrier to diffusion of particulates toward the epithelium.37 The extent to which mucus blocks particle diffusion depends on particle size and surface properties with smaller particles penetrating more and positively charged particles being mucoadhe- sive.37 The apical membrane of enterocytes is also covered with a complex glycocalyx composed of gly- cosylated proteins within the membrane which forms a size-selective barrier to the interaction of par- ticulate material with surface molecules.3839 The ability of the glycocalyx to block nanoparticle trans- location is determined by its thickness density nega- tive charge and renewal characteristics.40-42 Peyer's patches and other gut-associated lymphoid tissues accumulate particulate material due to the presence of antigen-sampling M cells at these sites which exhibit a remarkable capacity to transport material including proteins inert particles viruses and bacte- ria and deliver them to the underlying lymphoid cells.4344As an in vitro epithelial barrier model fully dif- ferentiated Caco-2 cells human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells are commonly used.

Especially for the oral exposure route the influence of gastrointestinal conditions on nanomaterials needs to be considered.Several in vitro models of the gastrointestinal epithelium have been developed ranging from mono- layers of a single cell type often Caco-2 cells to more complex co-cultures that for example incorpo- rate M cells and mucus-secreting cells.

This together with the variable and chronic nature of intake of particulates adds to the challenge of risk assessment of nanoparticle ingestion.97Nanomaterial toxicity is commonly investigated in vitro in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells and less often in fully differentiated Caco-2 cells.

The latter better reflect the native GIT and are generally less sensitive in showing cytotoxicity51 or in producing cytokines in response to exogenous materials.98 Nevertheless recent studies have reported adverse responses to Ag NPs2199-101 and ZnO NPs98 in differentiated Caco-2 cells although others have attributed the effects of Ag NPs in differentiated Caco-2 cells including the Caco-2M cell co-culture model to Ag ions.102Clearly there is a need to study the effects of prolonged nanomaterial exposure in vitro.

A study describes that orally administered glucan and polylactic-co-glycolic acid NPs in mice were transported through M cells and subsequently endocytosed by dendritic cells DCs in the Peyer's patches thereby not reaching the bloodstream.60 The close connection to the immune system also indicates that the intestinal immune homeostasis may be influenced by nanoma- terials.

Although acute toxicity of nanomater- ials to epithelial cells has been suggested from both in vitro and in vivo studies there is little evidence that this is a realistic risk due to low doses likely to be ingested.

Further pH changes in the small intestine mucus and resident microbiota in the GIT lumen add to the complexityof the environment encountered by nanomaterials within the GIT and affect their potential toxicity.Nanomaterial Interactions With the Gastrointestinal EnvironmentPhysicochemical properties and aggregation of nano- material will be affected by extreme pH and ionic shifts encountered during gut transit by co-ingested material such as food matrices and by the proteins mucus and bile acids secreted within the gut.20 Attempts to model the influence of the gut environment on nanomaterials include the use of an in vitro digestion model to assess the fate of 60-nm silver nanomaterials and nanometer- sized silica in the gut.216 These studies showed that the GIT environment as well as the presence and composi- tion of a food matrix affect the nanomaterial properties during transit before it is available for uptake in the small intestine.2122Nanomaterial Interactions With the Intestinal MicrobiomeOne underexplored area of relevance is the potential effect of nanomaterials on the normal bacterial micro- flora which is now known to play key roles in GIT development and regulation of inflammation.2324 As reviewed by Frohlich and Frohlich25 it is important to realize the cellular differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.

It has been reported that diverse nanomaterials including TiO2 SiO2 CeO2 and Ag NPs are transported across this epithelium2045-50 albeit sometimes negli- gible for TiO2.51 Interestingly the in vitro uptake in differentiated Caco-2 cells of 5-nm nano FeIII iron hydroxide adipate tartrate nanomaterials correlated well with human absorption.52There is no clear consensus as to which uptake route--transcellular or paracellular--is more impor- tant and this almost certainly depends on the specific properties of individual nanomaterials.

For example it is well known that bacterial translocation is enhanced by conditions such as trauma inflammation stroke and chronic alcohol use.7172 This translocation is likely to be mirrored by increased uptake of inert material a concept supported by in vitro studies demonstrating enhanced penetration of 2-mm polystyrene particles across cultured Caco-2 cells following alcohol treat- ment or irradiation which enhance TJ leakage.7374In addition to the now well-established use of polarized co-culture and three-dimensional 3D epithelial models recent advances in miniaturi- zation and microfluidics have resulted in develop- ment of organ-on-a-chip models.75-78 Such devices enable precise control of the cell microenvironment e.g.
