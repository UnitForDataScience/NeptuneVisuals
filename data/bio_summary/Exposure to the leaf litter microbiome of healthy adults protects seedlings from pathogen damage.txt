These cryptic symbionts known as foliar endophytic fungi FEF share strong similarities with other microbiota such as bacteria in their ecological organiz- ation and functional importance FEF communities can exhibit complex dynamics including host specificity priority effects and temporal and spatial variability and component FEF species can fulfil various symbiotic functions for their host including increasing plant vigour drought resist- ance and enemy defence - A growing body of literature suggests that many FEF are modifiers of host plant disease severity and multiple mechanisms of disease suppression by certain endophyte species have been identified including by secreting antimicrobial substances out-competing  2017 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

For instance a previous study placed FEF-free cacao tree Theobroma cacao seedlings in a forest where the presence and abundance of leaf litter within approximately 20 m of the seedlings had been manipulated Exposure to leaf litter increased FEF colonization of tree seedlings suggesting that FEF recolonize living tissues of the host or its neighbours from nearby senesced leaves  If local leaf litter is an important source of FEF colonization litter identity i.e.

Moreover while local leaf litter may be an important source of FEF near the forest floor vertical changes in abiotic conditions potentially filter which microbes suc- cessfully colonize host tissues at different microsites within the canopy as fungal spore densities are influenced by abiotic conditions such as humidity temperature wind light and canopy drip However even if local environ- mental factors alter FEF community composition it is unclear whether such changes affect host health or if differen- tial outcomes of community assembly are functionally redundant.Here we investigated whether variation in local leaf litter and canopy microsite altered the outcome of micro- biome assembly in cacao T. cacao.

Specifically we used endophyte-free T. cacao seedlings as sentinels for FEF coloni- zation to assess differences in FEF community assembly.

Most FEF are culturable so culture-based approaches can inform abundance and proportion of different FEF species in tissue while culture-independent approaches also improve sequencing depth .

Specifically FEF communities of no litter plants maintained high levels of diversity at 30 m whereas plants exposed to cacao or mixed litter experienced a signifi- cant drop in FEF diversity at this height electronic supplementary material figure S3.

For instance FEF-free plants can be grown in growth chambers and greenhouses and inoculated with particular fungal species FEF-free seedlings can also be transplanted into the field to examine how FEF communities form in nature.
