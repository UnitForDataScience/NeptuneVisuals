We characterized daily changes in the intestinal microbiota in three acutely ill patients with anorexia nervosa over the entire course of hospital-based renourishment and found significant patient-specific changes in microbial composition and diversity.

We therefore i characterized daily changes in composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota in three patients with acute AN during hospital-based renourishment and ii identified enteric bacterial groups associated with metabolic changes during treatment.MethodsThe study was approved by the Biomedical Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill UNC.

We may have been underpowered to detect changes in more complex longitudinal models but this does not rule out possible associations between changes in microbial composition and diversity and changes in BMI dietary intake or psycho- pathology.

Future work should aim to elucidate temporal changes to the intestinal microbiome during renourishment and associated changes in metabolic activity which will increase understanding of host- microbial dynamics during treatment and could help explainpersistence of weight dysregulation and metabolic changes in individuals who have recovered from AN.AcknowledgementsThis study was funded by the Foundation of Hope the UNC Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders Board of Visitors Fund and TJ's Fund for Eating Disorders Research Academy for Eating Disorders Bulik Principal Investigator and partially supported by a K01 DK 092330 an R01 MH 105684 and a CGIBD pilot feasibility grant P30DK03498 awarded to Dr. Carroll.
