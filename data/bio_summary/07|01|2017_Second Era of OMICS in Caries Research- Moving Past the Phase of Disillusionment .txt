Despite the obstacles cited above OMICS research is expected to encourage the discovery of novel caries biomarkers and the development of next-generation diagnostics and therapies for caries control.

These observations apply equally to the study of other oral diseases.Keywords dental caries biofilm next-generation sequencing microbiome genome metabolomeIntroductionAdvances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics have facili- tated the disclosure of numerous oral microbial taxa and their associations with dental health or caries activity Aas et al.

The dysbiosis is driven by environmental changes such as a sugar- frequentacidic-pH environment in caries and a protein-rich neutral-to-weakly alkaline-pH environment in periodontal dis- ease Takahashi 2015.OMICS studies also underpinned a pivotal aspect of the caries process--the presence of bacteria does not necessarily indicate metabolic activity.

The perfect storm of dental caries and how the postgenomics era can help to understand caries.

In summary the use of OMICS approaches can decipher microbial composition and function and relating those to host or environmental features will unravel the interactions between the 3 pillars of caries disease and how to modify them to reduce caries risk in the clinical practice from a holistic approach.In addition to focusing on bacteria e.g.

Noticeably the tools needed to interpret and translate the OMICS data into clinical practice demand expertise from multiple disciplines such as biology dentistry mathematics statistics and bioinformatics.ConclusionThe application of OMICS techniques has provided more depth to existing hypotheses as well as new insights in the eti- ology of dental caries which emphasizes that some long-held caries paradigms should be revised.

Despite current problems with study design and data analysis OMICS research is expected to encourage the discov- ery of novel caries biomarkers and the development of next- generation diagnostics and therapies for caries control.

The application of OMICS has provided more depth to existing hypotheses as well as new insights in the etiology of dental caries.

The objec- tives of this symposium were to 1 recognize the applications of OMICS technologies including the advantages and disad- vantages of each method 2 gain knowledge on how the OMICS are contributing to the understanding of dental cariesand 3 outline the scientific evidence from current OMICS studies which support the development of novel approaches for caries diagnostics and management.
