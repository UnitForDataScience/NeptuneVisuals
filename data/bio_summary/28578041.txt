Similar relatively stable pH has been reported throughout the incubation 0.46 units' difference between 0 and 72 h of black tea and red winegrape juice polyphenols by human intestinal microbiota .NDSCG fermented with overweight microbiota exhibited similar pHpatterns to the lean fermentation except for the significant pH reduction for the lean microbiota 0-6 h. This pH reduction is in accordance with our previous study where colon fermentation of hgf-NDSCG showed high fermentability 75 and SCFAs production after 6 h with inoculum from normal donor longer fermentation incubation time boostedfavoredstimulated propionate production propiogenic fer- mentation .

The total phenolic content was 235 mg gallic acid equivalent GAEmL after gastrointest- inal digestion and over 13 35 of that amount was digested duringfermentation 6-24 h by the lean microbiota.6.566.787.02Catechin recovery increased significantly 8.5- and 10.8-fold the original value for lean and overweight microbiota respectively after 24 h colonic fermentation consistent with the pattern observed withMeans in a column for hours with different small letters are significantly differentP  0.05.Means in a row for each sample with different capital letters are significantly different P  0.05.Results are the average of three independent experiments.NDSCG - nondigestible fraction of spent coffee grind.

In contrast rutin present in lean microbiota colon digest increased with fermentation time with 36 higher amount released after 24 h than at 6 h. The lean microbiota also contained a small amount of p-coumaric acid after 6 h fermentation.

Gallic acid release was similar during colon fermentation with lean and overweight microbiota 70 68 and 90 for the lean and 68 62 and 94 of the original content for the overweight microbiota after 6 12 and 12 h fermentation respectively and comparable with those reported  for SCG flavonoids for normal microbiota 58 64 and 95 of the original content after 6 12 and 24 h respectively.

Moreover high coffee intake did not exert significant differences in antioxidant enzymes catalase SOD and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances TBARS in a case controlled study .Most coffee bean components are retained in spent coffee groundsSCG the residue obtained after brewing.

The insignificant pH change of hgf-NDSCG probably indicates that most of the short chain fatty acids SCFAs generated during the fermentation was absorbed similar to those reported for coffee mannooligosaccharides andor other fructo-oligo- saccharides .

Chlorogenic acid of NDSCG was rapidly metabolized and partly degraded into caffeic acid with 33  13 of the original caffeic acid content retained after 24 h fermentation with lean fecal micro- biota similar to those of coffee .

Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were collected and cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 1 x 104 cellswell under the growth conditions indicated above for 24 h.
